<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263638967">I would love everyone&#39;s input to help me understand further what the label<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; means to everyone.  Does it mean different things to different<br/>
people?  How differently can people unschool without being thrown out of the<br/>
category?<br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling is freedom.  It&#39;s not following a schedule or curriculum.<br/>
Not forcing your child to learn anything. Letting your child learn at his<br/>
own pace. Letting the child direct his own learning.  Letting him follow his<br/>
passions.  Making resources available to him.<br/>
<br/>
If my child wants to learn how to knit, what is the &quot;unschooling&quot; way to do<br/>
that?  If I sit down with her and &quot;teach&quot; her how to knit, am I no longer<br/>
considered an unschooler?  Am I supposed to just tell her to learn it on her<br/>
own?  And if I hadn&#39;t taught her to read using the &quot;system&quot; she requested<br/>
(because that wouldn&#39;t be considered &quot;unschooling&quot;), then she would have to<br/>
wait to learn how to read on her own first, then years down the road, she<br/>
could read a book teaching her how to knit.  That doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t unschooling about letting the child decide how to learn?  Wouldn&#39;t it<br/>
be contrary to unschooling to tell my child he couldn&#39;t learn a certain way?<br/>
Or do I have it all wrong, and unschooling is about only using alternative<br/>
methods of learning?  If that were the case, wouldn&#39;t it be wrong to have<br/>
any non-fiction books available to them at all?  If they want to learn about<br/>
the different types of animals, wouldn&#39;t using a book be cheating?  Shouldn&#39;t<br/>
they go out into the woods and somehow &quot;figure out&quot; the anatomy of a wolf on<br/>
their own?<br/>
<br/>
If the book we used to teach my kids to read has been successful and<br/>
enjoyable for my kids, I see no problem with it.  My son also got bored<br/>
towards the end of the book and we stopped.  I didn&#39;t force him to continue.<br/>
But by then he had the basics down and just started reading books on his<br/>
own.  If my youngest daughter never comes to me asking to learn how to read,<br/>
I will have the confidence that she will learn in her own way.  I am not<br/>
debating that.  But if she does come to me asking to learn to read, I will<br/>
help her.  If she is interested in using the book, great.  If not, we&#39;ll<br/>
find another way.  But isn&#39;t using word games and puzzles just another<br/>
&quot;method&quot;?  What makes that way of learning so different from learning from a<br/>
book?  I&#39;m just saying that unschooling shouldn&#39;t be about what to do, or<br/>
what not to do.  For my family, it&#39;s about letting each child decide how,<br/>
when and what he wants to learn.  If that includes &quot;conventional&quot; methods<br/>
when the child *requests* it, does that kick us out of the unschooling<br/>
category?<br/>
<br/>
What if the child wants to learn piano, and wants to take piano lessons?  Is<br/>
it only considered unschooling if she learns how to play piano on her<br/>
own?  Does<br/>
taking a &quot;lesson&quot; make her not an unschooler?  I&#39;m truly not trying to be<br/>
argumentative and I hope I&#39;m not coming across as such.  I&#39;m sincerely<br/>
trying to learn more about what unschooling is.  Is it possible that it<br/>
means different things to different people?   Aren&#39;t there unschoolers and<br/>
&quot;radical&quot; unschoolers�are there other layers to unschooling?  Is the<br/>
definition I have in my heart about the term &quot;unschooling&quot; wrong??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047184233">right on sister!! Who is to say that your way or my way is the wrong way and how did they get so smart and so a matter o fact?? If the kids want to take a book of any kind and learn from it and need some instruction maybe because it is above their own learning at the moment should I say *no, son if you can&#39;t do it yourself and I need to teach how to do it so you can learn then you need to learn how on your own or wait untill you can do it yourself sorry.*  That doesn&#39;t seem right to me at all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I knit.  I&#39;m not very good at it, I don&#39;t do it enough, but I knit and<br/>
I enjoy knitting.  I enjoy the whole process, finding a pattern,<br/>
picking out the yarn and the buttons and carrying it around with me<br/>
hoping that I will finish it more quickly if I keep it present.  I<br/>
have a sweater (jumper for Brits--is it a jumper in Australia and NZ<br/>
as well?) that I&#39;ve been working on since Christmas 3 years ago.  I<br/>
had to restart it once, and I ran out of the wool that I could only<br/>
replace by going to the U.S. to get it (which I did last summer).  I<br/>
have half of the sleeves and the turtleneck to finish.  Those are my<br/>
credentials as a potential instructor of knitting.  <br/>
<br/>
I taught myself to knit. My mom taught me when I was 7 or something,<br/>
and I can remember lying on a lawn chair in the backyard with a ball<br/>
of nylon blue yarn attempting to knit and getting horribly bored with<br/>
it.  I didn&#39;t want to learn, or maybe I&#39;d asked, but wasn&#39;t actually<br/>
interested, just wanted something that I could do with my mom.  But,<br/>
when I was pregnant with Linnaea I got a couple of books out from the<br/>
library and a pattern from a friend&#39;s wool shop and began the most<br/>
ill-fashioned sweater imaginable.  I worked on it when we were driving<br/>
from Albuquerque to Wichita, KS for Christmas with my grandparents.<br/>
When I got there Grandma looked through her piles of knitting supplies<br/>
and found a pattern for a sweet little jacket for the baby to be.  Mom<br/>
and I went out and bought some cotton yarn, and pulled apart the other<br/>
monstrosity, and I knit this little jacket.  And  Linnaea wore it in<br/>
her passport photos.  <br/>
<br/>
If Simon or Linnaea were to approach me with a desire to knit, I would<br/>
offer them the knitting bobbin thing that my mom gave us from France,<br/>
which both of them have played with off and on.  And I would sit with<br/>
them.  I used to have a knitting machine where you crank the handle<br/>
and feed the yarn into the dealy and out comes this long tube of a<br/>
knitted thing which invariable became some sort of slightly homely<br/>
doll&#39;s dress, maybe I&#39;d find one of those to play with.  If they were<br/>
really interested in knitting, in making themselves something with<br/>
yarn, I&#39;d show them how I knit.  I have tons of needles, my grandma<br/>
(same grandma) gave me her collection, some of them make amazing<br/>
daggers (big, bright blue daggers with a white, very short hilt) so<br/>
could easily offer them the tools and I have lots of wool lying about.<br/>
 I even have a little drop spindle so they could spin their own wool,<br/>
which is lots of fun and lead to Simon collecting lots of balls of<br/>
wool for me from the Blue County Fair in Minnesota last summer.  <br/>
<br/>
But I would be careful not to push knitting on them.  I find that<br/>
there are many things, like knitting, that I had to grow into.  Maybe<br/>
at 7 when I lay on my lawn chair in the warmth of the Nebraska sun<br/>
part of what kept me from paying attention to perling and knitting was<br/>
that I didn&#39;t have the hand-eye coordination yet.  My hands hadn&#39;t<br/>
grown into knitting. Or maybe it was that running through the<br/>
sprinkler or hiding in the prohibition hole under the closet floor<br/>
were much better ways to spend my free, not-in-school, glorious summer<br/>
days.  For years I saw knitting as something beyond my ability because<br/>
of those moments on the chair. Embroidery suffered at the same hands.<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t make them fearful of the difficulties of knitting.  But I<br/>
would be careful to make sure that their path with knitting wasn&#39;t<br/>
paved with frustrations.  I wouldn&#39;t strew their path with the<br/>
frustration of believing that they could only learn to knit if they<br/>
taught themselves from a book, as I did. And if it was something that<br/>
they could only learn from a book or from reading, like a walkthrough<br/>
for a gamecube game, I&#39;d read it to them, I would never suggest to<br/>
them that if they were reading this would be so much easier for them.<br/>

&gt; the label<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; means to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a label for me, it&#39;s a philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To me, unschooling is freedom.  It&#39;s not following a schedule or  <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
Not forcing your child to learn anything.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you believe it is possible to force someone to learn something,  <br/>
you haven&#39;t learned enough about how learning works and what it  <br/>
really is.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Letting the child direct his own learning. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to direct anything when unschooling is in full flow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If my child wants to learn how to knit, what is the &quot;unschooling&quot;  <br/>
way to do<br/>
that?  If I sit down with her and &quot;teach&quot; her how to knit, am I no  <br/>
longer<br/>
considered an unschooler?  Am I supposed to just tell her to learn it  <br/>
on her<br/>
own?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;sit here for an hour because you said you wanted to learn  <br/>
to knit&quot; that would be a kind of teaching that many people feel is  <br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
What would you do if an adult friend asked you to help her learn to  <br/>
knit?  Treat your children as you would friend you like�intelligent  <br/>
adult friends.   You would show them, answer their question, maybe  <br/>
show them how to read directions in a book if they wondered what all  <br/>
that number-letter stuff means, right?  You&#39;d talk to them about  <br/>
sizes of needles and yarn, probably.  You would probably stop as soon  <br/>
as they seemed distracted or tired, even if that was five minutes later.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And if I hadn&#39;t taught her to read using the &quot;system&quot; she requested<br/>
(because that wouldn&#39;t be considered &quot;unschooling&quot;), then she would  <br/>
have to<br/>
wait to learn how to read on her own first, then years down the road,  <br/>
she<br/>
could read a book teaching her how to knit.  That doesn&#39;t make sense  <br/>
to me.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re casting your thinking in extremes.   You have claimed (which  <br/>
indicates you either thought it or believe that WE will believe it)  <br/>
that the options were using the book you used (which I doubt your  <br/>
daughter went and bought and brought to you) OR waiting YEARS.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a false model, and you can get emotional about the &quot;choice&quot;  <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t a choice between those two things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t unschooling about letting the child decide how to learn?   <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it<br/>
be contrary to unschooling to tell my child he couldn&#39;t learn a  <br/>
certain way?<br/>
Or do I have it all wrong, and unschooling is about only using  <br/>
alternative<br/>
methods of learning?--=<br/>
<br/>
None of that.  None of those are a yes or no answer.  You&#39;re thinking  <br/>
on the crusty edges instead of relaxing into the middle more  <br/>
receptively.  If you&#39;re not receptive, you can&#39;t learn from this  <br/>
list.  If you&#39;re sure you konw as much as people who&#39;ve been  <br/>
unschooling for ten or fifteen years, why ask us any questions at all?<br/>
<br/>
-=- If that were the case, wouldn&#39;t it be wrong to have<br/>
any non-fiction books available to them at all?  If they want to  <br/>
learn about<br/>
the different types of animals, wouldn&#39;t using a book be cheating?   <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t<br/>
they go out into the woods and somehow &quot;figure out&quot; the anatomy of a  <br/>
wolf on<br/>
their own?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is nothing but a frustrated rant. So was the rest of the post,  <br/>
up to this point:<br/>
-=- I&#39;m truly not trying to be argumentative and I hope I&#39;m not  <br/>
coming across as such. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to say you&#39;re not trying to be argumentative.<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to be not trying to be.<br/>
It&#39;s important to try NOT to be argumentative.<br/>
<br/>
No one else forced you to hit &quot;send.&quot;  If you really didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
be argumentative, you could have asked questions in the middle,  <br/>
instead of frightened kinds of slasher-music questions designed, it  <br/>
seemed,  to suggest people here had never thought of those things.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some places to read answers to all your questions.  They&#39;ve  <br/>
all been asked before:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
-=- If that includes &quot;conventional&quot; methods<br/>
when the child *requests* it, does that kick us out of the unschooling<br/>
category?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to be certified an unschooler.  YOU decide when you  <br/>
feel comfortable.  No one will either invite you in or &quot;kick you  <br/>
out.&quot;  Some individuals might think you could do better.  If you  <br/>
don&#39;t care about their opinions, it&#39;s no problem.  If you care too  <br/>
much about their opinions, that&#39;s a kind of problem all on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Care about your children first.  If ideas here help you, use them.   <br/>
If they don&#39;t, don&#39;t.<br/>

 <br/>
Walmart (and I&#39;ve seen them on Ebay) sells this circular thing, I think  it&#39;s <br/>
called a knitting loom?  Or something like that.  It&#39;s a circle,  with pegs <br/>
all around it.  Somehow, you just wrap the yarn around it and you  end up <br/>
knitting.  Ebay sells them in a variety of sizes so you can do all  sorts of <br/>
things. <br/>
 <br/>
Years ago (I&#39;m not sure if they make them anymore!) I bought a CD Rom from  <br/>
Walmart, made by COATS thread and yarn company, that teaches knitting.  It  has <br/>
every step demonstrated, and you can pause it, rewind, etc.  It was  GREAT!  <br/>
They had one for Crochet too, but when I went back to the store  they were all <br/>
gone.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226909921">TV is right up there with politics and religion.  I<br/>
mean this topic elicits more questions than &quot;What<br/>

even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>

and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>
in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>
lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>
this up first.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>
down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>
shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>
conversations have happened because of this.<br/>
<br/>
We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>
and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>
and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>
room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>
passively and watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
It offers siblings a chance to do something together. <br/>
Or, it can get them apart!<br/>
<br/>
Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>
due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>
activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>
<br/>
Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>
beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>
study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>
movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>
musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>
<br/>
My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>
has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>
sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>
<br/>
TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>
to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>
make me cry.<br/>
<br/>
The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>
and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>
glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>
never see in person.<br/>
<br/>
I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>
connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>
watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>
us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>
for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>
bonding.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>
as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>
housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :). <br/>
These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>
full advantage!<br/>
<br/>
It really adds to our never-ending list of questions. <br/>
The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>
and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>
great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>
kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>
actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>
than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>
because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>
<br/>
It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>
feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>
<br/>
It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>
their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>
they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>
go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>
with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>
and laugh and bond together.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>
I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>
often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>
and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>
book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>
most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>
well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>
gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>
things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>
<br/>
And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>
regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>
shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>
go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>
the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>
watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>
interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>
experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>
you get the idea.<br/>

I suppose it depends on the restriction. But they aren&#39;t in school, they <br/>
have more opportunity for free time to choose to watch television than <br/>
do children who are forced to spend 8 hours a day in an institution.  I <br/>
could easily say that they spend a smaller proportion of their free time <br/>
watching television, or focusing on television than do those children <br/>
who have their time limited by school and after school care.  And maybe <br/>
that is a big factor in looking at the applicability of those studies <br/>
that suggest that limiting television is a good thing to do.  With <br/>
limitations already in their lives, children who are in school have a <br/>
much smaller free-time budget to devote to full lives that can <br/>
incorporate television with other choices.<br/>

setting limits.  You who are deeming television as something crucial to <br/>
minimize, however large your limit it is still a limit.<br/>

arbitrary time limitation for television, is that I have grown to trust <br/>
Simon and Linnaea&#39;s ability to address their own needs appropriately.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that I have no input in what they are doing, but it <br/>
does mean that if I suggest something and they turn it down I trust that <br/>
they have good reasons for doing so.  And I am getting better at not <br/>
feeling hurt by their rejection of my ideas :-) . If I trust them to <br/>
know what they want, if I trust them to learn to negotiate the world in <br/>
those ways that best suit them, I can easily trust them to take or leave <br/>
television as they desire. And if I were to start deciding that <br/>
television was far, far less important than doing the things that I want <br/>
them to do, I would be sabotaging so much of the relationship they have <br/>
with me and their understanding of how much they can affect their own <br/>
world. <br/>

mom&#39;s &quot;suggestions?&quot;  If not, then they aren&#39;t really mere <br/>
suggestions are they?  Sometimes kids really do watch tv by default <br/>
because they don&#39;t have better options, so I think having other <br/>
options to choose from (or to choose simultaneously) is a good <br/>
thing.  But &quot;choice&quot; would be the key word to me- MORE options, not <br/>
purposely-made-fewer options.<br/>
If the hard part about making a choice is that there&#39;s something on <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t want to miss, there&#39;s always programmed VCRs or <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t beleive that after 2 hours (or however<br/>
&gt; short or long) of tv that suggesting to my kids that they might  <br/>
&gt; want to find<br/>
&gt; something else to do is belittling or undermining their trust -  <br/>
&gt; that is just<br/>
&gt; silly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if after what you felt was too short of a time reading a really  <br/>
good book your husband suggested it would be better to find something  <br/>
else to do, how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
First, it means he&#39;s watching you and judging how you&#39;re using your  <br/>
time and you aren&#39;t meeting his standards of acceptability.  <br/>
Personally it would make me feel pretty icky to know my husband was  <br/>
watching me and checking his watch and waiting for me to do something  <br/>
he thought was better. :-/<br/>
<br/>
Second, it means he thinks your judgement of how you spend your time  <br/>
isn&#39;t as good as his.<br/>
<br/>
Kids shouldn&#39;t be *left* to drift to the TV for 2 hours. But if TV is  <br/>
what they want to do of all the options available to them then it  <br/>
will help unschooling to give them the freedom to do so.<br/>
<br/>
*BUT* the other options better be appealing *to them*! Offering to do  <br/>
things with them is better than sending them off to play. (If they  <br/>
preferred to play, they&#39;d already be doing that.) Offering to go  <br/>
places that they enjoy or you&#39;re certain they&#39;ll enjoy, bring kids  <br/>
in, take them to other kids&#39; houses is better too.<br/>
<br/>
But to be a real choice, they need the freedom to say &quot;no thanks.&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Its one issue and it need not be made into such a huge deal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To the makers of the rules, it doesn&#39;t need to be a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Freedom and empowerment is found in a varity of ways and tv, or  <br/>
&gt; lack of tv<br/>
&gt; is barely a taste of what freedom or empowerment completely, or  <br/>
&gt; even partly<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The discussion really isn&#39;t about TV. It&#39;s about the freedom to  <br/>
explore in a rich supportive environment in ways that *children* find  <br/>
meaningful. It means being their partners in helping them get what  <br/>
they want. It means offering options that appeal *to them*.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is much more out there that is far, far more important than<br/>
&gt; missing a few tv shows bc mom suggests another activity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t missing shows if they&#39;re choosing to do something that  <br/>
appeals to them more. They&#39;re making a choice to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
(Also there are VCRs and TiVo to record. I found that when my  <br/>
daughter knew she could watch something anytime -- rather than the  <br/>
specific time the station put a show on -- that she often chose not  <br/>
to watch. What sometimes keeps kids glued to the TV is fear of  <br/>
missing something new or a favorite episode.)<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re making them turn the TV off, to do something else, it  <br/>
shows a lack of respect for their feelings. How would you feel if  <br/>
your husband shut the TV off and told you to do something else when  <br/>
you were watching something you enjoyed? What if he shrugged your  <br/>
protest off because he didn&#39;t think your protest was important since  <br/>
you&#39;d already been watching (in his estimation) &quot;too much&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sure that<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the point, but maybe someday I&#39;ll get it!!  &lt;wink&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And your husband is out with his buddies and says &quot;Yeah, my wife gets  <br/>
upset when I send her off to do something other than read that silly  <br/>
book she bought. Maybe someday I&#39;ll get it!!&quot; &lt;wink&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90415956">I&#39;m noy sure how this fits here but I think it does...<br/>
<br/>
My 22yo went through a period when he was about 18) when he went to <br/>
clubs and parties with his friends and got drunk. I hated that. But <br/>
though I remeinded him about not driving, keeping safe etc. I bit my <br/>
tongue till it bled not saying - lecturing -  all the rest of the stuff <br/>
I wanted to say. Ds never fit in with other kids his own age. His head <br/>
was simply somewhere else altogether, and he didn&#39;t care. Then he <br/>
reached a point where he wanted to fit in with &#39;normal&#39; people, and by <br/>
that time partying was where they all were.<br/>
<br/>
Last night one of his mates rang to ask him (pressure him actually) to <br/>
join him at a party. He just kept saying no. He was having way to much <br/>
fun at home, thanks all the same - playing Settlers of Catan with his <br/>
girlfriend, his mother and his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we have to work through our need to do things, and sometimes <br/>
the need is not for the thing we do: the drinking may be a need to fir <br/>
in, the tv watching a need to establish control, either can be a need to <br/>
get as much in before someone takes it away - as so many parents do when <br/>
after a week of &#39;freedom&#39; the kid is still watching tv &#39;all the time&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But when we are truely free to make our own decisions, we will not want <br/>
to spend our whole life doing one thing - tv watching, drinking - even <br/>
READING! as I found when I was on bedrest when pregnant with ds#1. Mind <br/>
you, I wouldn&#39;t mind having a second go at that last :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just love these things Joyce said....<br/>

&gt; even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it really cracks me up.  Because TV is like a<br/>
&gt; godsend around here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My girls really like to wake up slowly watching TV.<br/>
&gt; This is great for me because it gives me a chance to<br/>
&gt; drink my espresso, read the paper (still looking for a<br/>
&gt; dog), switch the laundry, maybe do a little pilates,<br/>
&gt; and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>
&gt; in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>
&gt; lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>
&gt; this up first.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>
&gt; down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>
&gt; shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>
&gt; conversations have happened because of this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>
&gt; and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>
&gt; and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>
&gt; room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>
&gt; passively and watch TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It offers siblings a chance to do something together.<br/>
&gt; Or, it can get them apart!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>
&gt; due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>
&gt; activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>
&gt; beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>
&gt; study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>
&gt; movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>
&gt; musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>
&gt; has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>
&gt; sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>
&gt; to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>
&gt; make me cry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>
&gt; and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>
&gt; glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>
&gt; never see in person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>
&gt; connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>
&gt; watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>
&gt; us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>
&gt; for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>
&gt; bonding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>
&gt; as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>
&gt; housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :).<br/>
&gt; These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>
&gt; full advantage!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It really adds to our never-ending list of questions.<br/>
&gt; The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>
&gt; and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>
&gt; great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>
&gt; kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>
&gt; actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>
&gt; than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>
&gt; because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>
&gt; feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>
&gt; their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>
&gt; they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>
&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>
&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>
&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>
&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>
&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>
&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>
&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>
&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>
&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>
&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>
&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>
&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>
&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>
&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>
&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>
&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>
&gt; you get the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121560095">I missed this one... where did it come from originally?  How can I  <br/>
contact<br/>
Sarah?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh THAT&quot;S where that went!!  I pulled it up and it disappeared. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was on this list, March 24.<br/>
<br/>
I was cleaning out the e-mail, and knew it was great, so I put it here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/learning">http://sandradodd.com/t/learning</a> (on an existing page in the TV  <br/>
section, which begins <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and has some new art).<br/>
<br/>
I was going to announce it to my subscription-to-site-news list and  <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to send it here.  But I&#39;m not sorry.  Good accident.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I need several other small tales of something a kid  <br/>
learned from TV.  Could people here help me out?  I&#39;d love to fill up  <br/>
that page.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sarah is Sarah Anderson-Thimmes.  She&#39;s on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some other things she wrote:<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday, while I was getting ready for work, Dora the Explorer was<br/>
on while Jalen watched. I heard him speaking Spanish back to Dora<br/>
everytime she asked for help, it cracked me up.<br/>
He was even rolling his &quot;r&#39;s&quot; while saying &quot;arriba&quot; with Dora over and<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I have made some really fabulous connections over<br/>
Japanese Anime, something I would probably not learned about on my<br/>
own. They tell me about Japanese mythology and spirituality they&#39;ve<br/>
picked up, why the artist uses certain facial features and the<br/>
symbology in it all.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra loves the home improvement, fashion and cooking shows. She<br/>
wants to take a cooking class with me now and has decided she&#39;ll earn<br/>
money as a chef someday, simply being a chef at home for now.:)<br/>
We&#39;ve had lengthy discussions spawned from the show &quot;How do I Look?&quot;<br/>
as to the damage that parents create when they don&#39;t honor their own<br/>
child&#39;s uniqueness. One Goth girl was on it and we were SO upset at<br/>
the parents I could hardly watch it.<br/>
This girl had designed her own clothing...very unique and creative,<br/>
and they were all over her about looking freaky. It was terribly sad.<br/>
We got something different from that show than you&#39;d have thought.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra told us how to cook a fish one night, in detail. She comes to<br/>
us with written recipes for things I&#39;ve never heard of, craft projects<br/>
and is constantly looking up information online because of something<br/>
she heard or saw on tv.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, Trevor has learned a TON about various wars (mostly<br/>
the civil and WW11 though), weaponry and history from tv. I really<br/>
don&#39;t know where he learns most of what he learns now, only that when<br/>
he shares stuff with me it a bit strange because he&#39;s REALLY well<br/>
informed and intelligent, but he seems to spend most of his days on<br/>
World of Warcraft!!:)<br/>

Joanne sent this (below) and now my page is all balanced.  But I can  <br/>
absolutely find places for other such sweet stories!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I hadn&#39;t thought about this for a while but when I saw your post I<br/>
remembered. My youngest (7 years old) was having a conversation with<br/>
our neighbor (8 years old and in school) about space. Jacqueline is<br/>
VERY interested in space and what it takes to become an astronaut. She<br/>
She was telling our neighbor that she likes learning about space and<br/>
that she and her dad had just hung up a model of the solar system in<br/>
her room. This boy already thinks my kids are weird because they *like*<br/>
learning. LOL He said &quot;I already finished learning about space in<br/>
school. We&#39;re done now&quot;. She started talking about Galileo&#39;s life and<br/>
different facts about the planets. He said &quot;I told you we already<br/>
*finished* and now we&#39;re done. I don&#39;t have to remember it anymore. I<br/>
passed my test.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-When she came in I asked her where she learned about Galileo&#39;s  <br/>
life and<br/>
how she knew such cool facts about the planets. She told me from,<br/>
Reading Rainbow and NOVA. :-)  -=-<br/>
<br/>
(Thanks, Joanne.)<br/>
