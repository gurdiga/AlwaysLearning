<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790992021">I feel like Miss Piggy, reporting on *moi,* but today it can&#39;t be  <br/>
helped! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have my contract for speaking at the HSC conference and so that&#39;s a  <br/>
go.  August 16-19, Sacramento<br/>

<br/>
The speaker intros makes it seem I&#39;ll only be there Sunday, but  <br/>
they&#39;re going to change that, I think.    I&#39;m keynote speaker on  <br/>
Sunday, but I&#39;m speaking Friday too, and doing a music workshop  <br/>
(singing) Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s some up to the moment news (and history, photo of me and  <br/>
Keith from 27 years ago or so) here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
and a request for advice on which photo of my kids should go into the  <br/>
Live and Learn conference brochure.  They can&#39;t decide.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I am thinking of driving over to Sacramento for a day and hearing you<br/>
speak.  For a new unschooler what day would you recommend that I come (since<br/>
you know your speaking schedule.. bwg).  It will probably just be me coming<br/>
since I&#39;m saving extra money for attending Life is Good or Live and Learn<br/>
(or both) in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Friday there&#39;s a general unschooling discussion, but the time is not  <br/>
yet determined.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning there are two talks in a row, from 9:00 to noon (not  <br/>
in the same room, but one after the other).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know which day would be better otherwise.<br/>
