<div id="ygrps-yiv-945584895">***&gt; what were the child&#39;s answers?<br/>
<br/>
He answered normally, there&#39;s no major weirdness in their family...&lt;g&gt;<br/>
...no not interested in school... I have a baby sister... no, we go out<br/>
and do stuff...<br/>
<br/>
She has found a different doctor but I don&#39;t know that she&#39;d ever<br/>
questions this one as to why he asked such questions.<br/>
<br/>
I am really wondering now if this happens a lot to homeschoolers.  To<br/>
every kid the doctor gets alone?  Public school kids too?  Or just<br/>
homeschoolers because they&#39;re &quot;isolationists&quot; or some other unpleasant<br/>
thing?<br/>
I still think it&#39;s creepy.<br/>

We had something similar happen the last time I took my kids in.  Our<br/>
new Dr. was very concerned that my 7yo ds couldn&#39;t tie his shoes (well<br/>
why should he, he either wears clogs or pull-on shoes).  He was also<br/>
concerned that ds couldn&#39;t read yet (we, his parents, are not<br/>
concerned).  The Dr. was very vocal about this, while ignoring the fact<br/>
that my then 4yo dd could read and could tie her shoes (she learned<br/>
because she wanted to know).<br/>
<br/>
He started handing me pamphlets after he found out we homeschooled, on<br/>
things like nutrition, what children should know at the end of<br/>
kindergarten, how important socialization is (I think they meant<br/>
socializing), etc...  I looked at the pamphlets in my hand and asked him<br/>
if he gave these to all parents or just the homeschooling ones.  His<br/>
answer?  Just the homeschooling ones, they don&#39;t seem to have enough<br/>
information or resources.  While he was still in the room in tipped all<br/>
the pamphlets into the large trash can.  I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re going back<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance abounds, even in the medical community.<br/>
