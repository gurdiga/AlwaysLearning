<div id="ygrps-yiv-777646540">So...  Tomorrow is a big day for me in a way.  My youngest child turns  <br/>
18.  No longer do I need to worry about what the state thinks she  <br/>
should be doing as far as school goes.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not here.  Her birthday party will be at Diana Jenner&#39;s house.    <br/>
We&#39;ll get to see her Thursday, and give her gifts then, bug if any of  <br/>
you who know her want to send her a birthday note, she has a blog.    <br/>
(If you&#39;re her MySpace of Facebook friend you already know she&#39;s  <br/>
there; she&#39;s not loving Facebook, though, so that&#39;s not a great place  <br/>
for a &#39;party.&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hollyintherealworld.blogspot.com/">http://hollyintherealworld.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to go on here on the list, for those of you who don&#39;t know  <br/>
her, and whose children are little and for whom having a child turn 18  <br/>
seems a lifetime away.<br/>
<br/>
Holly will be here (home/Albuquerque) for the Monkey Platter Festival,  <br/>
and then is going to England before Thanksgiving, to stay with Julie  <br/>
Daniel&#39;s family for a while, and will be back for the Unschooling  <br/>
Symposium in Santa Fe.  In March she&#39;ll go to Quebec to stay with Bea  <br/>
Mantovani&#39;s family for a while.  Maybe a long while.  Holly&#39;s  <br/>
eighteenth year is shaping up to be pretty exciting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you get a chance to leave a birthday comment for her somewhere, I&#39;d  <br/>
appreciate it.   You could leave one on my blog, if you&#39;d rather do  <br/>
that.  I&#39;ll put a Holly-birthday post up there for tomorrow.<br/>

Meanwhile, if you want to see Marty dressed as a female pirate, with  <br/>
fake eyelashes and a wig, that might tide you over until Holly&#39;s  <br/>
birthday is the lead item.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.  I do feel relief and the congratulations are appreciated. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s wholly over.  It seems to phase out slowly rather  <br/>
than ending abruptly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132723760">Yes thank you for all tips  and helping me take responsability for my own peace in the house.<br/>
Breathing is something to learn on my priority list :-) But today was easy as I could rely on a new found awareness, built up lately, with all the birthday anticipation.The presence of my husband helps.<br/>
Again thanks to the list for helping me keep the focus on what counts.<br/>
We are having a bright sunny day and are watching Mickey mouse dvd...<br/>
