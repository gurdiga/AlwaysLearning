<div id="ygrps-yiv-740188951">I&#39;ve got a roadblock I need help with. My boys (8 1/2 & 3) were  playing with <br/>
balloons this morning. Kicking and tossing around ones that were  already <br/>
blown up, blowing up more and twist-tying them shut or asking me to knot  them <br/>
closed. It soon turned to stuffing balloons in their clothing and being  silly <br/>
with that. There was some upset and then discussion about how other people  <br/>
want their clothing and items in them (the younger was trying to unzip his  <br/>
brother&#39;s pajamas and remove the balloon the older wanted to keep in there).  Then <br/>
they switched to popping. Wyl popped one as he was trying to put 2 (very  <br/>
large) balloons against his chest and zip his p.j.s closed and the pressure of  <br/>
too small a space made it pop. That stung, but it was fun, too, so he decided to <br/>
 pop one on purpose. I hear him encouraging his brother to put a balloon in <br/>
his  p.j.s and I glanced at them to see Wyl&#39;s hand slightly behind his body <br/>
from me  and I asked what he was popping the balloons with. He hesitated then <br/>
pulled his  hand to the front to show me the paring knife he was holding. I was <br/>
horrified  and stunned. I didn&#39;t freak out, but I wasn&#39;t completely calm, <br/>
either.<br/>
 <br/>
This is the kid that&#39;s known knife safety and used sharp knives for food  for <br/>
years. I guess I should say I *thought* he knew knife safety-he seemed to  <br/>
know safety from his own standpoint. Also, this is the sharpest knife I own-not  <br/>
that either of the boys knows that. We talked about it for a moment and what  <br/>
could happen and that even though he used it on himself and didn&#39;t hurt <br/>
himself,  how one can&#39;t judge as well going toward someone else, plus not being <br/>
able to  predict another&#39;s sudden movements. He seemed to be somewhat regretful <br/>
and that  he understood the possibilities of the situation. The knife got put <br/>
away. Not 2  minutes later, I heard them talking about popping the balloons <br/>
again and looked  in to see that he had now gotten the knife out again and given <br/>
it to his 3 year  old brother to pop his own balloon.<br/>
 <br/>
I see in hindsight that I should have talked to them about better ways to  <br/>
pop the balloons, but now I&#39;m seriously concerned about the sharp knife  <br/>
situation. If I remove the knives from Wyl&#39;s access, it will have to be under  lock <br/>
and key, as he does not respect requests to leave things in certain places  <br/>
alone (he spoiled some of his gift surprises this way), even if they are put up  <br/>
&quot;out of his reach&quot;. Not that we do a lot of that, we just have a small <br/>
cupboard  over the stove for a few items-mostly surprises for the boys for a later  <br/>
date.<br/>
 <br/>
At this point, I&#39;m stumped as to what to do about the knives and if I&#39;m  just <br/>
expecting too much &quot;respect for other people&#39;s things and other people&#39;s  <br/>
wishes&quot; from a boy about to turn 9 in April. I&#39;m out of creative thinking ideas  <br/>
in this department, and thought I&#39;d ask here for some of your ideas. I hope <br/>
I&#39;ve  given all the details....<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

He would feel mature if you tell him it&#39;s one thing for him to use a  <br/>
knife, but that doesn&#39;t make it smart to hand one to the three year  <br/>
old.  Tell him policemen and soldiers who know how to use guns don&#39;t  <br/>
hand them to kids to play with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a very cool thing to do with balloons.  Put a piece of scotch  <br/>
tape on it--regular clear tape.  You can stick a pin in there (like a  <br/>
sewing pin) and the balloon won&#39;t pop.  Stick it where the tape isn&#39;t  <br/>
and it will pop it.  Your kids might like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And along with that you could talk about what&#39;s BEHIND the target.   <br/>
If they want to shoot an arrow at a target, the target should NOT be  <br/>
being held by someone.  You could come up with similar examples and  <br/>
make them laugh, but they would also remember it.<br/>
<br/>
Find safe places to put a balloon to stab it maybe.  In a corner?   <br/>
But you don&#39;t want them stabbing the wall or the baseboard.  What  <br/>
about inside a small cardboard box?  But what&#39;s under or behind the  <br/>
box?  What about in a hole dug in sand or snow? A pan filled deeply  <br/>
with uncooked rice or beans?<br/>
<br/>
Go WITH their interest, not against it, and talk about it in ways  <br/>
that open their minds up joyfully, not that close them down with  <br/>
embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Marty cut his friend&#39;s hand once.  They had duct taped his wrists,  <br/>
playing something, and Marty tried to cut the duct tape off but cut  <br/>
the other boy&#39;s palm, just before his mom showed up.  It needed  <br/>
stitches.  I was mortified.  The other mom was cool and calm and not  <br/>
mad at the boys.<br/>
<br/>
I cut my thigh through overalls with an Xacto knife once,  years ago,  <br/>
cutting cardboard.  The cut on my leg healed, but the patch on the  <br/>
overalls reminded me for years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435436809">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I see in hindsight that I should have talked to them about better ways <br/>
to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pop the balloons &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try always to give them the safe way to accomplish the goal first.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the conversation brief &quot;Ooh, that knife&#39;s too big to use for that <br/>
safely - here&#39;s a push pin.&quot; Or even better &quot;two push pins, one each.&quot; Or <br/>
even better &quot;three push pins. Can I pop some balloons too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you focus on continuing the activity, safety gets taken care of in <br/>
passing - organically. The main thing is that they learn over and over that <br/>
they can rely on you to keep them safe while they follow their interest.<br/>
<br/>
He already knew - he was hiding the knife behind his back. He just couldn&#39;t <br/>
think of a better idea and really wanted to keep popping.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; At this point, I&#39;m stumped as to what to do about the knives and if <br/>
I&#39;m  just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expecting too much &quot;respect for other people&#39;s things and other people&#39;s<br/>

alternative, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Empathy (respect for other people&#39;s things and wishes) is another. It can&#39;t <br/>
be forced. It comes on at the right developmental time, and varies in <br/>
strength. It&#39;s a whole other topic.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a 9 year old should be made responsible for keeping a 3 year <br/>
old safe, although it might be good to have a conversation with him at <br/>
another quiet time about how he is bigger and can do things that his brother <br/>
can&#39;t manage safely yet. Trying to have this conversation while the balloons <br/>
alluringly beckon is probably poor timing.<br/>

Once when my mom had my sister&#39;s two younger boys, she (mom) looked out <br/>
the back door and called, &quot;Where are you?&quot;  And the youngest yelled <br/>
back, &quot;We&#39;re in the trees, Mamaw, and we don&#39;t have any knives.&quot;  LOL  <br/>

Right. My mind was so overwhelmed with the possibilities of what *could*  <br/>
have happened, I couldn&#39;t get out of that mode. I knew I could get unstuck here.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
It makes me wonder... Wyl was 5-ish when we happened upon radical  <br/>
unschooling, and Storm was born when Wyl was 5 1/2. Storm (3) was the one who  came up <br/>
with an alternate popper. Is it personality or is it because he&#39;s been  <br/>
respected and trusted in his judgements from the beginning? I know there&#39;s not  an <br/>
answer, really, but I do ponder sometimes...<br/>

moment..instead of the panick reaction. Recently my 9yr old DD had been <br/>
poke/stabbing her younger sister with a wooden chop stick that she <br/>
witled down to be sharper. I comforted the injured and then calmy got <br/>
out a melon for the 9 yr. old to stab...explained that it was not ok to <br/>
poke/stab people..that they could get hurt ect. This whole experience <br/>
lead to much discussion about swords and weapons and her recent <br/>
enrollment in a fencing class!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea!<br/>
<br/>
Marty liked to stab things, so we found cardboard boxes for him.   <br/>
Playdough or modelling clay can be good, too.  Or what about  <br/>
Sculpey?  She could do stabbing designs that will last.   There&#39;s a  <br/>
kind of artistic texture done on metal with a ballpeen hammer, too,  <br/>
that might interest her.  Thin copper or even thicker, copper or  <br/>
brass or aluminum.<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned a thing from Shari Lewis when she had a TV show.  You  <br/>
put a paper  napkin or paper towel over the top of a full glass of  <br/>
water (or nearly full) with a rubber band around it, so it&#39;s like a  <br/>
paper lid.  Set a penny on it.  Take turns sticking a skewer (or a  <br/>
sharpened chopstick!) through it, into the water, and back out.  At  <br/>
one point the paper will collapse, so it&#39;s a contest not to be the  <br/>
one who makes the fatal poke.<br/>

I just thought of another thing I did/said sometimes.  I would&#39;ve  <br/>
said &quot;HEY, if a stranger came in here and stabbed you with a sharp  <br/>
stick, I&#39;d call the police.&quot;  Make it funny, but true, and that might  <br/>
help her remember that it&#39;s really not okay to poke someone with a  <br/>
stick.   Or tell her to go to the mall and try it on some people  <br/>
there, if she&#39;s sure it&#39;s a good idea.<br/>

learning so much about how very different thier needs are...and how to <br/>
meet them more effectively and respectfully. I have to say that it is <br/>
not always easy...at least for me...It&#39;s simply to react to a <br/>
problem/situtation... with the auto-pilot &quot;Stop That&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; and <br/>
worse...&quot;What&#39;s wrong with You?!&quot;...but to stop and think/and or breath <br/>
and than act...is work...like establishing a new habit. But the results <br/>
make the effort worth your wild.<br/>
