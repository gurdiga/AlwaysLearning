<div id="ygrps-yiv-565630611">I am new to this list and hope that this question is appropriate as<br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t based on &quot;traditional&quot; school-age.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Xander, is 15-months-old, and we are starting to experience times<br/>
when he wants to be awake at night. Not because he&#39;s upset, just because he<br/>
wants to play or some-such. This doesn&#39;t happen very often at the moment,<br/>
however I&#39;m asking the question now because I imagine as he gets older<br/>
there will be times (maybe lots of time!) when he chooses to be awake<br/>
during the time that I would (normally) choose to be asleep.<br/>
<br/>
My concerns revolve around safety mostly, being that Xander is only<br/>
15-months-old, but even as I cast my mind forward weeks, months, years, I<br/>
find it discomforting that I can&#39;t come up with even a general idea of what<br/>
&quot;age&quot; would be appropriate for him to be awake unsupervised. How do other<br/>
unschooling families tackle the issue of children who, for their own<br/>
reasons, choose to be awake when you would normally choose to be asleep?<br/>

By the time he&#39;s ready, you&#39;ll be more comfortable because you&#39;ll know him and have experienced him making thoughtful decisions.<br/>

<br/>
When my girls were one and two I had a baby proofed playroom with a futon on the floor. They were both nursing, and that helped (as.does cosleeping, which naturally teaches them your sleeping pattern.), I&#39;d sleep in the playroom, lol and I had a baby gate up so we were all in the same area. I kept child safe snacks accessible and had tv/vcr in room. YES, my one year old knew how to use it. Also, you learn to time into your kiddos so you know what they are doing while you sleep.<br/>

<br/>
The principles of unschooling can work in a person&#39;s life no matter what age the children are, but with children who are not legally required to be in school or a legal alternative, one isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling,&quot; really, fully, until compulsory attendance age comes and goes.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mention it, but the statement &quot;...as unschooling isn&#39;t based on &quot;traditional&quot; school-age&quot;-=- isn&#39;t quite true.<br/>
<br/>
If a person says &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot; and then when the child is four or five sends her to school, and so never did homeschool, then in retrospect they didn&#39;t really unschool.<br/>
<br/>
But I do understand the point,<br/>
and the answer about being awake or asleep is &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do other<br/>

reasons, choose to be awake when you would normally choose to be asleep?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t consider it an issue to be tackled.  That&#39;s too adversarial, too violent.<br/>
<br/>
Think instead of the principles involved.  People do need to sleep, at some point.  Children like to explore and learn; unschooling is about learning.  Peaceful parenting is about creating a peaceful, safe, happy environment.  <br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t so much &quot;choose to be awake&quot; as they ARE awake.  <br/>
If a child is awake, someone needs to be awake to take care of him.  Either find ways to comfort your child to sleep, or find someone else to be awake so you can sleep, or wake up and watch him.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if I was sick or really tired, I would set up videos and toys and a floor bed for my oldest, and lie down on the couch in that room, trying to stay awake.  It wasn&#39;t always the safest thing, but I told him if he needed me I was right here--that was permission to wake me up. It only happened three or fourtimes.  If that had been combined with a child who wanted to run, or who had been told &quot;no, don&#39;t touch that&quot; a lot about things in the house, it could have been a time for him to sneak around and do things that wouldn&#39;t have been done if I were awake.  But we had said yes a lot, and he was comfortable in the house, without secret desires or curiosities or desperation to FINALLY see or do or try or touch something, so he was most likely going to stay there near me, watch the show, and play with the toys.<br/>
<br/>
But if something had happened and he had been hurt it would have been fully my fault.<br/>
<br/>
The answer to that isn&#39;t to threaten a child to GO TO SLEEP.  The answer is to find ways to be awake when the child is as patiently and as lovingly as you can.  It will pay off in the long run (and the short run, too).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272426466">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My youngest does this once every couple of weeks or so. He&#39;ll wake for 2-3 hours. I just put on a DVD on our portable player and he watches it in bed next to me while I (try) to doze. I&#39;m not sure if my son would have done that at 15 months old though, but it gives you an idea of what you can do in the future that isn&#39;t too energetic for the middle of the night ;-)<br/>

Now and then, people stay up late, and you roll with it. Every night means it could be a good idea to change your own sleep schedule to make things easier on everyone. And in between there are other ideas and solutions. <br/>
<br/>
For several years, Mo (now 10) had a pretty regular sleep routine and I could more or less predict when she&#39;d be going to bed... most of the time. Sometimes she&#39;d have a late night or three, and then back to normal. The thing was, now and then her whole cycle would shift by two hours - just like that. It would take me about a week to realize it was a shift, not just a few late nights, and then another week of feeling jet-lagged to catch up. <br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s still like that to a degree, but nowadays it doesn&#39;t matter so much if I&#39;m up or not, since night-time is when she tends to get really deep into a project and doesn&#39;t want to be disturbed, anyway. <br/>
