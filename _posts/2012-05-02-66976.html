Brie brought that link to another discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t now about electricity or trains, but had heard that part of the purpose of a windshield on early cars (when they were just like open wagons) was to cut down the feared effect of high speeds on the human body.<br/>
<br/>
This is a short article, and interesting, and oddly written (or maybe translated?).<br/>
<br/>
What they didn&#39;t suggest overtly was a dismissal of and disrespect for children and women.  I think that&#39;s a big part of it.  And if the technology is something children can understand and use easily that removes parental power and control, and puts a parent in a position of not knowing more than the child.  That&#39;s a danger to &quot;respect and discipline.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the larger study looks at those things.  I hope so.<br/>
