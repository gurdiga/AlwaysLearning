<br/>
I REALLY wasn&#39;t looking for pity, but thanks for your thoughts! I&#39;m really <br/>
fine with all this.<br/>
<br/>
We all have to make choices, and after years of putting up with her and <br/>
making myself miserable, I finally decided it was best for everyone if I just <br/>
became a bitch to her and her alone. Works like a charm. I DO miss seeing my <br/>
Dad as often, but we work that out. <br/>
<br/>
Would it break my heart if my boys followed suit and cut ties with me? You <br/>
betcha! But I&#39;ve made it very clear to them WHY I&#39;ve done this (and that they <br/>
can carry on any relationship they want with her---or none at all). And I try <br/>
my best to be the best mom I can be for THEM---and NOT the very best showcase <br/>
mother, looking for the accolades of the other society mothers. <br/>
<br/>
It was a lot easier when we lived abroad or across the country, but living in <br/>
the same town is impossible!<br/>
<br/>
She followed ALL of Rosemond&#39;s advise (even before there WAS a <br/>
Rosemond)---and look where it got her!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I call her Nancy or Mother when I mention her at all. My Dad is <br/>
Daddy, Papa or Pop. My boys call him Opa ( the #1 son was born in Germany) or <br/>
Pa (#2 son couldn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; the first syllable long ago---kinda&#39; sounds like <br/>
what Opie called Andy---Paw). Papa loves both! I called my grandmothers <br/>
&quot;Doolie&quot; and &quot;Ganny&quot;---early attempts at Julia and Granny.<br/>
<br/>
I was Mommy until they got a certain age, then it became Mom. I miss &quot;Mommy&quot; <br/>
sometimes. <br/>
