<div id="ygrps-yiv-403164397">This discussion about the non-existent really radical unschoolers that are <br/>
really neglecting their children reminded me of a comment someone gave me <br/>
last week.<br/>
<br/>
Another homeschooler was over here and hadn&#39;t seen the house since I&#39;d moved <br/>
here. When I showed her around she saw one of my big bookshelfs full of books <br/>
and materials and said something like &quot;oh, you still have all the books and <br/>
stuff?&quot;<br/>
As though unschoolers didn&#39;t use real life materials!!! The ignorance is <br/>
amazing.<br/>
I made some comment about what did she think unschooling was if we weren&#39;t <br/>
making loads of stuff available to our children and she replied that she <br/>
thought I would have gotten rid of anything curriculum oriented.<br/>
What, like dictionaries?<br/>
Or the science books my kids love?<br/>
What exactly do people think unschooling means? Not DOING?<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
