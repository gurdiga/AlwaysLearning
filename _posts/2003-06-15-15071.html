<div id="ygrps-yiv-121700427">Is there an Unschoolers Utopia?  Hubby and I are getting ready to leave here<br/>
within the next couple years.  Mississippi just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore, and<br/>

the home school laws were much lighter(just fill out an enrollment form and<br/>

closer (but we don&#39;t see them all that much anyway). <br/>
<br/>
&lt;RANT&gt;It feels stifling here.  Not only do we not go to the local church,<br/>
which is a standard question around here, but we don&#39;t belong to the local<br/>

explaining constantly that we homeschool.  I mean, homeschooling is supposed<br/>
to be widespread around here from what I&#39;m told, but every time we are in<br/>
town during school hours the very same people who say that homeschooling is<br/>
popular ask my kids why they aren&#39;t in school... well duh!  Even at the<br/>
library the other day, I signed the kids up for their book thing (read 5<br/>
books and get a t-shirt, whoopee doo) so they could go to the little<br/>
activities they have this summer if they wanted too, the dude that gave us<br/>
our forms kept telling the kids to write neatly and pick books in their<br/>
reading level, and la de da...I was about ready to say forget it, but I just<br/>
told the kids to pick whatever book they wanted and levels don&#39;t mean<br/>
anything(they&#39;ve already read and had read to them, I was just going to list<br/>
those). We just wanted t-shirts!  Geesh.   They wanted them to put what<br/>
grade they were going to be in next year, I asked my oldest what grade she<br/>
would choose to be in if she went to school..lol.  He didnt&#39; want me to sign<br/>
up my 5yo and 2yo because they couldn&#39;t read!  But a librarian came over and<br/>
said they can be read to and made him sign them up. lol.  I was pretty<br/>
disappointed in the schooliness of it. &lt;end rant&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, we&#39;re hoping to find an interesting, small to mid-size town, and<br/>
unschool friendly.  Is there such a place?  Does anyone here live in a place<br/>
similar to that?  Oh and hubby hates the humidity here too..lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868442646">Ahh figures &lt;G&gt;  We moved &quot;home&quot; last spring after living in Alabama,<br/>
Louisiana, Tennessee over the last 7 years or so. We&#39;re in a perfect place<br/>
for us.. 45 minutes from my parents.. 45 minutes from in-laws. In case of<br/>
emergency we&#39;re close enough to be there and far enough away that they  have<br/>
to call before stopping by. :) Our place is within walking distance of the<br/>
beach.. about a 5 minute walk.. and we go fishing at night most of the time<br/>
because I&#39;m very very fair skinned.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to college last fall pursuing an associates degree in computer<br/>
networking and if they offer it.. one in computer security. My son is 13 now<br/>
and this is something I wanted to do. I go to class from 8am till noonish<br/>
and then we have the afternoon to do whatever we want. Since he&#39;s a teenager<br/>
he usually sleeps till 10 or so anyway LOL so it gives us a little time to<br/>
ourselves too. But the main reason is that we want to get ahead financially,<br/>
buy a house, etc. and I have developed an interest in computers over the<br/>
last 8 years :) so I wanted to do something with that.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a nice state park near Waveland/Bay St. Louis if your the camping<br/>
sort.. I&#39;d offer our place but we&#39;re in a duplex at the moment and its not<br/>
really very big. If you get the traveling bug let me know :)<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, the only problem is the unschoolers don&#39;t have any get-togethers or <br/>
much communication among themselves!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it is a good unschooling place.  Lots of stuff to see and do, and not <br/>
much junk, people don&#39;t ask you  what church you go to, and at least here at the <br/>
intersection of I-40 and I-25 (Albuquerque), if a kid&#39;s out in the day time <br/>
they can assume he&#39;s a tourist passing through.  And we have so many different <br/>
schools and schedules, it&#39;s NEVER obvious that a kid is out in the daytime.<br/>

 Computer security does sound interesting.  And being 5 minutes from the<br/>
beach...I like that. Keith says I would get sick of it after a few months..I<br/>
don&#39;t know, I might, but I would like to try it.  I know the kids would love<br/>
it and fishing and general marine life too.  We do like to camp and I think<br/>
I&#39;ve camped in Waveland before...back in my late teens with some friends..<br/>
kinda fuzzy.. but anyway, thanks for the invite.<br/>

Ahh figures &lt;G&gt; We moved &quot;home&quot; last spring after living in Alabama,<br/>
Louisiana, Tennessee over the last 7 years or so. We&#39;re in a perfect place<br/>
for us.. 45 minutes from my parents.. 45 minutes from in-laws. In case of<br/>
emergency we&#39;re close enough to be there and far enough away that they have<br/>
to call before stopping by. :) Our place is within walking distance of the<br/>
beach.. about a 5 minute walk.. and we go fishing at night most of the time<br/>
because I&#39;m very very fair skinned.<br/>
 <br/>
I went back to college last fall pursuing an associates degree in computer<br/>
networking and if they offer it.. one in computer security. My son is 13 now<br/>
and this is something I wanted to do. I go to class from 8am till noonish<br/>
and then we have the afternoon to do whatever we want. Since he&#39;s a teenager<br/>
he usually sleeps till 10 or so anyway LOL so it gives us a little time to<br/>
ourselves too. But the main reason is that we want to get ahead financially,<br/>
buy a house, etc. and I have developed an interest in computers over the<br/>
last 8 years :) so I wanted to do something with that.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a nice state park near Waveland/Bay St. Louis if your the camping<br/>
sort.. I&#39;d offer our place but we&#39;re in a duplex at the moment and its not<br/>
really very big. If you get the traveling bug let me know :)<br/>

Hi Kendra. We are in Hernando in the Northwest corner, not too far from<br/>
Memphis. Being close to the beach would make a difference I suppose. We&#39;d<br/>
probably spend most of our time out there, at least I would. You&#39;d probably<br/>
find me there constantly for at least the first couple of months. I love the<br/>
sounds. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;There HAS to be more of us ...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This, I do<br/>
believe, but finding them seems so hard. If we could just be<br/>
close to a couple of other unschoolers...I guess you aren&#39;t too awful far,<br/>
maybe 6 hours? If you don&#39;t mind me asking, why are you going to college?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922792638">He works at a power plant.  He didn&#39;t get to go into Marine Biology like he<br/>
dreamed of.  His counselors at school told him it wasn&#39;t a good field and he<br/>
would make no money so he shouldn&#39;t do that.  So he didn&#39;t know what else to<br/>
do, didn&#39;t want to go to college for no reason so he ended up in the Navy<br/>
for 11 years and was trained on nuclear subs. He got to be in the water but<br/>
not exactly doing what he wanted to...<br/>
Anyway, he was a contractor at the nuclear plant where my mom lives and that<br/>
s where we met.  He makes good money here which was the goal his counselor<br/>
and mom told him to have, but not really for him.  I can tell how unhappy he<br/>
is with his work, mostly because in exchange for the money he gets he has to<br/>
be there 12 hours a day and gets called in on his days off sometimes.  He<br/>
rotates shifts so that makes it worse.  By the time he gets relaxed and<br/>
ready to do some living on his days off, it&#39;s time to go back to work.  So<br/>
we made a plan to tie up ends and uproot.  It&#39;s working really well and<br/>
should be ready to make a move by the end of 2004 if there are no surprises.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All we have to do here is register also.  But we have lots of humidity..lol.<br/>
 New Mexico sounds nice.  I&#39;m thinking we are definately going to have to do<br/>
some traveling before we actually settle on a place, if we settle..lol. <br/>

Hey Tammy, I don&#39;t know what kind of work your husband does, but here in New<br/>
Mexico the only requirement to homeschool is to register.  It&#39;s a great<br/>
place to unschool.  As a bonus -- virtually no humidity!<br/>
