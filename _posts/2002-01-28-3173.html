We are fully addicted to that show, every once of us races to the tv when it&#39;s one so we can guess what &#39;new&#39; ingredient will be unveiled and how the chefs will prepare them..Then we try and fathom what they taste like (and we end up with some gagging noises sometimes!!)..Matter of fact this has sparked our newest &#39;idea&#39;..Once every other month we are going to experiment with different types of foods, I think Japanese will be our first since it&#39;s our &#39;inspiration&#39;..we&#39;re still working out the details but we will either be attempting to cook a traditional meal or finding a restaurant and experiencing a traditional meal :grin:..<br/>

:grin:.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a long time to wait until the next experimental moment!<br/>
Why the time span?  Seems very... structured.  Artificial.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m truly curious about why the plan would be &quot;once every other month&quot; for <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
