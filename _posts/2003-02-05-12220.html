Sending you wishes for quick healing, Dawn.  I had my tonsils out a year<br/>
ago, and it takes a while to bounce back from it.  Drink lots of apple juice<br/>
and suck popsicles, or whatever makes your throat happy!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad your husband is &quot;bothered&quot; about your kids and isn&#39;t putting them<br/>
in school and daycare!<br/>
