<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450923078">Hello!<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Susan.  I&#39;ve been a John Holt fan for years!  My four children have never gone to school; we learn as we live, and I can&#39;t imagine living any other way.  My children are: ds 10.5y,  ds 8y,  dd 5y, and dd 2.5y.  We live in eastern Massachusetts (Boston area).  <br/>
 <br/>
I am looking forward to getting to know all of you and hearing about your familys&#39; learning journeys. <br/>
 <br/>
This morning, we are off to &quot;Sit and Knit&quot;, a local (favorite) yarn shop, so I can buy more yarn for one of my passions--knitting.  While most American children are sitting in a classroom this morning, my children will be hearing about various fibers, knitting terminology, dye lots, and maybe will even give me a hand in calculating the amount of yarn I will need to purchase for my next project. <br/>
 <br/>
Already, this morning, the four of them are engaged in various activities that are meaningful to each of them:  oldest ds is playing Pokemon Ruby on his gameboy,  8yo ds is looking out the window and intently observing the squirrel who has befriended one of our cats (they sit together, touch noses, etc.--it&#39;s incredible!  My son has been feeding this squirrel for two winters now), 5yo dd is playing the piano (a tune of her own making, that is actually quite nice and musical), and 2.5yo dd is playing house.  Who knows what the rest of the day will bring?  Who knows what great discussion we will have?  What interesting topic we might read about together?  What fun game we might want to play?   Maybe someone will want to paint.  Maybe my oldest son willl finish the book he has been reading, maybe my 5yo dd will want to write a letter to her friend, maybe my 8yo will cook us pancakes for breakfast....<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a new day--isn&#39;t it wonderful?<br/>
 <br/>
