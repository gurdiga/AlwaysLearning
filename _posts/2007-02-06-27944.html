<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268967228">I am sorry.  I wasn&#39;t clear. Active<br/>
daily reader<br/>
and diligently trying to continue to grow as a life learner with six year old<br/>
special needs<br/>
son. When we were looking to relocate we were searching for other like minded<br/>
individuals<br/>
and families in various locations in the U.S. We just moved to above mentioned<br/>
area.<br/>
My desire was simply to share that we were in a new place and hoping<br/>
that for<br/>
anyone else looking to relocate or vacation that they might consider this lovely<br/>
area. I<br/>
apologize for the confusion. My hope is by actively and intentionally reaching<br/>
out to others<br/>
I can help expand the supportive community of like minded individuals and<br/>
families in my new geographical area. I do not want to create confusion or<br/>
detract from<br/>
the focus or purpose of this group so I<br/>
will be discontinuing any such further similar<br/>
types of posts on this<br/>
group. My apologies. Joanne O&#39;N.</div>
