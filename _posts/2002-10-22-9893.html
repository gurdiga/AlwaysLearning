 I guess my thoughts are that with any of the scouting (I don&#39;t know about <br/>
 Spiral Scouts) Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire.. they all have a <br/>
curriculum <br/>
 based outcome. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important aspects of Girl Scouts is Girl planning. From an <br/>
early age(and obviously with more guidance for little ones), the girls are <br/>
supposed to plan what they want to do. They have the badges and try-its, but <br/>
they are not required. In fact, the group itself can develop its own badge.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as with any volunteer-oriented organization, there are fabulous <br/>
and less-than-fabulous leaders. But with Girl Scouts, anyway, intention is <br/>
that the girls will plan what they want to do.<br/>

P.S. Girl Scouts are also a cult, for other reasons ;)</div>

comment on Girl Scouts.  But Camp Fire is much like this.  <br/>
<br/>
And I agree with you about the leaders.<br/>

 I guess I should have been more specific. &lt;g&gt; When the gentleman was talking <br/>
 about getting and keeping boys for three years, it followed a diatribe on <br/>
 being *Morally Straight and Religious* the molding he was referring too was <br/>
 more like badly hidden antigay, anti-anthing not conservative Christian <br/>
 rhetoric. We had also just discussed the issue of child safety, or rather, <br/>
 the BSA stance on molestation. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I am NOT pro <br/>
 molestation, but, BUT this man angered me in his instance that the BSA does <br/>
 its best to avoid anyone not morally straight becoming a leader, thus <br/>
 decreasing the chances of boys being sexually abused or lured into a <br/>
 lifestyle that isn&#39;t &quot;right.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BSA is running scared, clearly. they&#39;d like everyone to believe that they&#39;re <br/>
working to get the queers out of Boy Scouting, and that will keep your kids <br/>
safe. My nephew, who is eight, has become a Scout, and the first large <br/>
section (23 pages!!!) is about sex abuse. I have this suspicion that there&#39;s <br/>
a huge problem with sex abuse in Boy Scouts and it&#39;s going to come out, much <br/>
like the Catholic church. They want to cover their butts. Part of the antigay <br/>
stuff is, as my partner Beth says, The Old Men in Shorts at the national <br/>
level who hate perverts. But I suspect that they&#39;re also preparing for <br/>
massive lawsuits and needed a scapegoat.<br/>
