<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797630916">I&#39;m feeling momentarily stuck! My 9 & 7 year olds are being questioned by their schooled peers parents. The typical what did you do in school today? What did you do for science? Did you do math today? type questions. The questioning comes from neighbors and seems to happen when my guys are playing inside of their house. Our kids play together regularly. The parents are very well just trying to make conversation not realizing there&#39;s more to a child&#39;s life than school. However, their concept specific questioning isn&#39;t clear to my guys and has my mind spinning trying to help with response ideas. Although brainstorming response ideas isn&#39;t new, when it comes to this type of questioning I&#39;m having a difficult time. We don&#39;t live in a world broken into subjects. My kids nor do I want to be put in a position of explaining how we live. Especially to those that won&#39;t get it. I wanted to put this out to all your thoughtful minds hoping to have some response ideas to share with my kiddos before today&#39;s potential inquiries begin. Thank you much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357847770">Megan, now 8, developed a standard answer of &quot;I like animals.&quot; and then she&#39;d either talk about whatever animal had her interest at the moment or she&#39;d change the subject.  In our experience, most adults aren&#39;t really that interested in the answer - it is just the only way they can think of to talk to a child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657631020">If you&#39;ve been unschooling for awhile and the kids play together  <br/>
regularly, why do you think these parents are asking now? Are you  <br/>
there when your kids are being quizzed?<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is that *you* do the explaining to your neighbors. You  <br/>
might even tell them that your kids&#39; answers probably won&#39;t look like  <br/>
&quot;school&quot; answers. If you step in, it will take the immediate pressure  <br/>
off your children.<br/>
<br/>
Then, you can begin coaching them about what to say. Request that they  <br/>
call it &quot;homeschooling&quot; because &quot;unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t make much sense  <br/>
to most people and it&#39;s a form of homeschooling, after all. Ask them  <br/>
to use phrases like &quot;we learn hands-on&quot; and let them rattle off all  <br/>
the cool places they go and all the cool things they do with you.  <br/>
Suggest they talk about their passions with people who are inquisitive  <br/>
(like Gwen&#39;s &quot;I like animals&quot; response).<br/>

could be the buffer between her and inquisitive or just-plain-nosy  <br/>
people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395630066">I have always told my children that if anyone questions their homeschooling/schooling/unschooling (everyone just knows my kids are homeschooled, we don&#39;t get into details) I always tell them to ask their Mother if they want information. I do not feel comfortable with anyone questioning my children about their home education as we&#39;ve been attacked once already with CPS over it and I don&#39;t care to go through that again simply because my child might say &quot;We don&#39;t use a curriculum&quot; or doesn&#39;t know &quot;age appropriate&quot; math. <br/>
