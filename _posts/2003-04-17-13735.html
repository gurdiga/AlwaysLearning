growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s Holly&#39;s calling.  I was just the technician.<br/>
I&#39;m a grunt.  <br/>
Holly says &quot;chop here, shave here,&quot; I whimper and then cut.<br/>
Keith says &quot;remove stick&quot; I whimper and cut.<br/>
<br/>
Rough week for me, who thinks hair should just be left to grow in peace and <br/>
women shouldn&#39;t cut their husbands with knives unless they&#39;re REALLY tired of <br/>
them.<br/>
