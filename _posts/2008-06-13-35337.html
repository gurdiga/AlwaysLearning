Home-based education<br/>
Main article: Homeschooling<br/>
Families who seek alternatives based on educational, philosophical, or  <br/>
religious reasons, or if there appears to be no nearby educational  <br/>
alternative can decide to have home-based education. Some call  <br/>
themselves unschoolers, for they follow an approach based on interest,  <br/>
rather than a set curriculum. Others enroll in umbrella schools which  <br/>
provide a curriculum to follow. Many choose this alternative for  <br/>
religious-based reasons, but practitioners of home-based education are  <br/>
of all backgrounds and philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Curious unschooler that I am, I followed their hotlink to  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you think that &quot;true&quot; unschooling must by nature be radical and, <br/>
therefore, there should be no need for a separate name for radical <br/>
unschooling? By that I mean that it inherently must encompass every <br/>
part of life so that anyone who imposes any rules or limits or <br/>
schedules on any part of their children&#39;s lives is not really <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I know a few people have already sort of answered. I&#39;m not sure that <br/>
I like the term &quot;radical unschooling.&quot; I&#39;d like to be able to say <br/>
that we just unschool and have it understood. Most people don&#39;t <br/>
really understand what that means in terms of academics much less <br/>
the rest of one&#39;s life. I doubt I fully understand it myself. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; at all when talking to <br/>
people outside unschooling groups. I just tell others we homeschool <br/>
and let them think what they want. If they ask further about <br/>
curricula or whatever, I tell them we don&#39;t use curricula. We learn <br/>
what we want when we want. We study what we want when we want. We <br/>
use every available resource that interests us to learn as much as <br/>
we want about any given thing. People still don&#39;t get it. <br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s like trying to explain to people that we are atheist. <br/>
Most people who were raised with religion have no concept of what <br/>
that means. I get asked a lot what religion I will raise my children <br/>
with since I&#39;m atheist. LOL They cannot grasp in any way a life <br/>
without any religion or spirituality or school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755373120">Hi everyone! Being new to this group, and new to unschooling, I have a <br/>
question that has probably already been addressed somewhere but was needing <br/>
clarification. What about something as simple as the Times Table? What if a <br/>

something that comes in handy now and then. My husband is an &quot;Engineer&quot; and <br/>

Well if we call it &quot;true&quot; unschooling we won&#39;t need to use radical  <br/>
unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But there are unschoolers who unschool during school hours and live  <br/>

<br/>
Me too!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m not sure that<br/>
I like the term &quot;radical unschooling.&quot; I&#39;d like to be able to say<br/>
that we just unschool and have it understood. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I do.  I just say &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Then if the people quibble, I say  <br/>
we&#39;re radical unschoolers, if it seems it would help.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of weird, actually, that my main unschooling page says  <br/>
&quot;Radical Unschooling.&quot;  I made that page originally on expage.com  <br/>
long ago when free webpages were small and crummy.  And when  <br/>
geocities opened up, I moved my code and all and it seemed like  <br/>
moving from a tent to a mansion, because they weren&#39;t counting  <br/>
keystrokes anymore!!! Seriously, if I wanted to add another link, in  <br/>
the old days, I had to take one out.  If I wanted to add a five word  <br/>
phrase,  I needed to find out where to take out five words.<br/>
<br/>
So there was already a page called unschooling, so I called mine  <br/>
radical unschooling because I had to call it something. And whatever  <br/>
was put in the &quot;what will your page be called?&quot; was what showed up at  <br/>
the top of the page.<br/>
<br/>
So...  I wish when I moved it I had just called it unschooling.  I  <br/>
could change it!  Should I?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I still need adjectives, though.<br/>
<br/>
The real, true unschooling?  Unschooling for real.  The One True  <br/>
Unschooling Way?  (I&#39;m accused of that last one all the time.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441911947">~~What about something as simple as the Times Table? What if a<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s so simple, why would it matter?<br/>
If it&#39;s so simple, then it can be picked up easily, at any time right?<br/>
<br/>
If they never learn it how will that affect their life? So far, I can<br/>
see no ill effects from not knowing the times table. None of my<br/>
children have had the desire to memorize it. None of them have wanted<br/>
to learn &quot;proper&quot; keyboarding skills either...but it hasn&#39;t stopped<br/>
them from typing just fine.:)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to an unschooler who never learned her times tables: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lauriechancey.blogspot.com/">http://lauriechancey.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
She still has never learned them as far as I know, yet she managed to<br/>
get her masters degree. Oh, and she aced all her higher level math<br/>
courses. So apparently times tables are completely, totally and<br/>
utterly irrelevant unless you decide you want to learn them.<br/>
<br/>
Just like everything in life.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Home-based education<br/>
&gt; &gt; Main article: Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; Families who seek alternatives based on educational, <br/>
philosophical, or  <br/>
&gt; &gt; religious reasons, or if there appears to be no nearby <br/>
educational  <br/>
&gt; &gt; alternative can decide to have home-based education. Some call  <br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves unschoolers, for they follow an approach based on <br/>
interest,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than a set curriculum. Others enroll in umbrella schools <br/>
which  <br/>
&gt; &gt; provide a curriculum to follow. Many choose this alternative for  <br/>

I too am uncomfortable with the &quot;child-led&quot; description and don&#39;t use <br/>
it.<br/>
I do refer to myself as a radical unschooler, but only for <br/>
clarification as the situation dictates.  I don&#39;t really mind <br/>
the &quot;radical&quot; and it&#39;s handy for differentiation from &quot;academic&quot; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do.  I just say &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Then if the people quibble, I <br/>
say  <br/>
&gt; we&#39;re radical unschoolers, if it seems it would help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of weird, actually, that my main unschooling page says  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Radical Unschooling.&quot;  I made that page originally on expage.com  <br/>
&gt; long ago when free webpages were small and crummy.  And when  <br/>
&gt; geocities opened up, I moved my code and all and it seemed like  <br/>
&gt; moving from a tent to a mansion, because they weren&#39;t counting  <br/>
&gt; keystrokes anymore!!! Seriously, if I wanted to add another link, <br/>
in  <br/>
&gt; the old days, I had to take one out.  If I wanted to add a five <br/>
word  <br/>
&gt; phrase,  I needed to find out where to take out five words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So there was already a page called unschooling, so I called mine  <br/>
&gt; radical unschooling because I had to call it something. And <br/>
whatever  <br/>
&gt; was put in the &quot;what will your page be called?&quot; was what showed up <br/>
at  <br/>
&gt; the top of the page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So...  I wish when I moved it I had just called it unschooling.  I  <br/>
&gt; could change it!  Should I?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I still need adjectives, though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The real, true unschooling?  Unschooling for real.  The One True  <br/>

I like those pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Because (in part, I guess) because of my age, location and  <br/>
confidence, about half the time I&#39;ve said &quot;Are you familiar with the  <br/>
&#39;open classroom&#39; theories of the 70&#39;s?&quot;  And if the person says yes,  <br/>
I say &quot;It&#39;s like that, but without a classroom,&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s like that,  <br/>
only we use the whole world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good answer, for those who light up and do know &quot;open  <br/>
classroom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they say no, they aren&#39;t familiar with it, and if they&#39;re  humble  <br/>
and curious, I&#39;ll give them a very brief review and tell them the  <br/>
University of New Mexico was big in some of that.    If they&#39;re cocky  <br/>
and just trying to be dismissive of me, I look at them and nod and  <br/>
give my best look to suggest that I&#39;m trying to decide whether  <br/>
they&#39;re smart enough to understand it if I did explain it, and then I  <br/>
just say, &quot;Oh.  Well, it&#39;s that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty confident.  It&#39;s never gone past that.<br/>

driven learning.&quot; I liked that - but then people started asking their  <br/>
children, &quot;What are you interested in learning?&quot; The kid might say,  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m interested in thunder,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m interested in horses.&quot; &lt;G&gt; The  <br/>
parent would put together (or buy) a unit study on weather or horses.  <br/>
They&#39;d do math - &quot;If you had six horses and one got scared and ran  <br/>
away during a thunderstorm, how many are left?&quot; Not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of just like &quot;learning&quot; all by itself. My kids, when they were  <br/>
young, would be asked: &quot;What do you do in home school?&quot; They&#39;d say,  <br/>
&quot;We learn.&quot; &quot;How do you learn?&quot; My kids: &quot;We just learn all the time.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;What do you learn?&quot; My kids: &quot;We just learn whatever there is to  <br/>
learn.&quot; How do you know what you&#39;ve learned?&quot; My kids: &quot;I know what I  <br/>
learned because I&#39;m the one who learned it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on. I heard lots of frustrating (to me) conversations like this  <br/>
between my kids and their friends and cousins.<br/>
