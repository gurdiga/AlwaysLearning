<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050475803">I got an e-mail today and have had an exchange.  It&#39;s become kind of  <br/>
weird and hostile, so I thought I would share it because it&#39;s  <br/>
interesting in light of some recent discussions about what people  <br/>
want out of unschoolers.  It&#39;s long; don&#39;t read it it if gets boring.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken off an intro that said the person had read someone else&#39;s  <br/>
unschooling site and called and talked to someone else who told her I  <br/>
might be able to help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to answer the questions in separate e-mails.  Feel free to  <br/>
contribute to those as they come by!  I&#39;ll blind-copy the mom who  <br/>
asked, until she joins the list or decides she&#39;s not interested  <br/>
anymore.  I know there are newer members of this list who honestly  <br/>
could use the answers to those questions.  I&#39;m willing to write out  <br/>
answers for groups of interested people, but one-on-one to an  <br/>
antagonistic person seems a bad use of my time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, unschooling is NOT for me and my family for many reasons.   <br/>
I do believe some of the basic principles (learning is fun, children  <br/>
learn from modeling, etc.) however, as a whole I find that it&#39;s core  <br/>
really breeds self-absorption.  I don&#39;t see much evidence on any  <br/>
website that encourages values I find important for my family.  I see  <br/>
a lot of contradiction and don&#39;t really see the &quot;freedom&quot; that  <br/>
unschoolers preach.  I see a lot of labels being used and many  <br/>
assumed perceptions and admonishment of what is labeled as  <br/>
mainstream.  For the record, to admonish, demean or judge anyone  <br/>
else&#39;s way of life really doesn&#39;t show compassion and peace.<br/>
<br/>
Next, there is the legality of this way of life.  In my state, you  <br/>
must be a certified teacher to homeschool.  For myself, I have no  <br/>
college education, therefore, to pursue this avenue I would be  <br/>
breaking the law.  Many others in my situation go through a facility  <br/>
designed for this reason - to assist homeschoolers- but again there  <br/>
is a curriculum decided by someone other than the parent.<br/>
<br/>
Last, my questions are these:<br/>
What is the difference between principles and rules?<br/>
What is the course of action when principles are not followed?<br/>
What is the difference between parent facilitation and a teacher?<br/>
Why do unschoolers negate the need for learning unless an immediate  <br/>
need exists?<br/>
How does unschooling teach children to truly compromise?<br/>
How does catering to each child/individual teach family values?<br/>
What do you recommend for families that cannot financially keep up  <br/>
with childrens&#39; demands?<br/>
How does unschooling teach a child to assess a situation socially?  <br/>
Meaning, if a child has been catered to their entire life how do they  <br/>
learn to give of themselves or take a passive role in a situation?<br/>
How does unschooling teach the vital difference between needs and wants?<br/>
How does unschooling prepare children for a world that is not catered  <br/>
to their interests?<br/>
How does a child  from this lifestyle learn to be independent when  <br/>
the parent has facilitated their needs, wants and learning from day one?<br/>
These are just a few of the many questions I have about this  <br/>
lifestyle.  Any time you could find to answer these would be greatly  <br/>
appreciated.  Thank you!<br/>

Inquisitive Mom of Two Boys<br/>

(Sandra to the Always Learning list:)<br/>
<br/>
So it turns out she&#39;s wrong about the law in her state.  Still  <br/>
believing she wanted to know more about unschooling (even though she  <br/>
said it wasn&#39;t for her), I wrote back in short informational chit- <br/>
chatty ways, but I asked this:<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
In your first e-mail you wrote &quot;Honestly, unschooling is NOT for me  <br/>
and my family for many reasons.&quot;  Why, then, are you asking [the  <br/>
other mom] for help?  Why did you send me eleven questions, the  <br/>
answers to which could take many hours, if you don&#39;t want to  <br/>
unschool?  I&#39;ll consider answering all your questions if you&#39;ll  <br/>
answer that.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
==================================================<br/>
<br/>
The response is here:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize I was asking either of you for help.  I am doing  <br/>
just fine in my &quot;mainstream&quot; world.  I simply believe that when  <br/>
people create websites and go on National TV as &quot;advocates&quot; for this  <br/>
or that and claim superiority over others they should be  open to  <br/>
answering questions.  I asked questions because I am curious...isn&#39;t  <br/>
that one of your ideals of unschooling...asking questions about  <br/>
whatever interests someone?  However, I have found that with  <br/>
unschooling my questions are only answered IF I want to &quot;convert&quot; or  <br/>
I agree or am searching for an alternative to my current situation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
================================================<br/>
<br/>
I responded:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those two lists have 1800 and 1500 members.  You could join one and  <br/>
get LOTS of answers to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-.  I asked questions because I am curious...isn&#39;t that one of your  <br/>
ideals of unschooling...asking questions about whatever interests  <br/>
someone? -=-<br/>
<br/>
For my kids, sure!<br/>
<br/>
For strangers who want hours of my time, I&#39;m not unschooling them.    <br/>
I don&#39;t mind people asking questions about unschooling because  <br/>
they&#39;re interested in learning more.  I feel no obligation to argue  <br/>
with people who state that they&#39;re doing just fine and that  <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t for them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems perhaps you have some emotional wound involving unschooling  <br/>
and you keep scratching at it.  What&#39;s the deal?  [The other mom]  <br/>
says you hadn&#39;t contacted her for 18 months or so, so why did you  <br/>
write to me today?  Have unschoolers been mean to you?  Do you have a  <br/>
website or something you&#39;re advocating that unschooling is thwarting  <br/>
or disturbing?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
============================================<br/>
Reponse:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting.  I understand you are too busy to answer any of my  <br/>
questions.  That&#39;s OK.  Actually, [the other mom] and I had our phone  <br/>
conversation a while back...I hadn&#39;t counted the time to be honest.   <br/>
However, we had made contact via IM over the computer more recently  <br/>
where she suggested I contact you.  I had taken time to browse some  <br/>
sites (including yours) before emailing you.<br/>
<br/>
As for my emotional wounds, I have none related to unschooling.   <br/>
Interesting jump to conclusions, though.  I am just simply curious  <br/>
about the lifestyle.  I didn&#39;t realize my questions involved hours of  <br/>
discussion and that I needed to have a reason to ask them.   <br/>
Unschoolers are not really accepting of anyone outside of their  <br/>
community and I find that interesting for a lifestyle that supposedly  <br/>
promotes peace.  I find that any lifestyle lived in one end of the  <br/>
spectrum or another can be thwarting to some degree.  What disturbs  <br/>
me is the attitude of superiority that the Unschooling Community  <br/>
seems to hold.  There could be some useful techniques or tips from  <br/>
your lifestyle I could use in my life, however, I will never know  <br/>
since no one will answer some basic questions.  Thank you for your  <br/>
responses.<br/>

<br/>
It turns out, and the woman admitted it, that her first inquiries  <br/>
were over a year ago.  She&#39;s stuck on the questions in some unhealthy  <br/>
way.  I&#39;m going to answer them, and I&#39;ve already sent her a link to  <br/>
this group.  She can reveal herself or not as she wishes, but I&#39;m  <br/>
uncomfortable being treated in a hostile way in secret.  It seems a  <br/>
little spooky and potentially unsafe.   A couple of people do know  <br/>
who she is, so if I&#39;m discovered ritually murdered, forward this to  <br/>
the police.  (I&#39;m exaggerating my fear, but weirder things have  <br/>
happened in the world of stalking.)<br/>
<br/>
Questions and answers next.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123180104">This so-called &#39;inquisitive mom of two boys&#39; is so far from unschooling it&#39;s not funny.  From <br/>
the misperception of unschooling as a &#39;spoilt&#39; child free-for-all to the adversarial tone and <br/>
total lack of openness, you wonder what is motivating her to pick this fight.  Her list of <br/>
questions (and in fact her entire set of exchanges) shows an intellectual laziness - in that <br/>
with some effort she could find/create/understand all the answers herself.  No doubt the <br/>
answers would make good reading for those exploring the world of unschooling.  However, <br/>
to really participate in an email exchange or discussion list, a person should first have done a <br/>
lot of reading and thinking so that they can bring to the discussion something that is worthy <br/>
of people&#39;s time and consideration (a point Sandra made in the intro to this list).<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I hope she&#39;s not a stalker but just a person who will disappear when her hostilities <br/>
are brought out into the light of day.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057957362">She lives near me, Nancy, here in California. (She&#39;s wrong about our  <br/>
state requiring homeschooling parents to have teacher certification,  <br/>
of course.)<br/>
<br/>
Her kids have always gone to school and daycare. She started out  <br/>
responding negatively about unschooling on the message boards at the  <br/>
Dr. Phil website after Dayna Martin and her family were on his show.  <br/>
That was around 2 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to say what her reason is for continuing to question  <br/>
unschoolers for years since she is very adamant that she&#39;s not  <br/>
interested in unschooling her own kids.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s already had a lot of chance to become better informed, but  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have been able to take it in and understand it. And,  <br/>
because she is quite verbose, she provides us with a lot of evidence  <br/>
about what the somewhat informed and still disapproving general public  <br/>
might think about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana is in the midst of writing her &quot;Personal Statement&quot; for her  <br/>
university application and she&#39;s written about unschooling. I&#39;ve been  <br/>
trying to think about how it is going to come across, given that the  <br/>
readers are going to very likely be hearing of unschooling for the  <br/>
first time. Are they going to have knee-jerk negative reactions? Will  <br/>
it make her more interesting? I just don&#39;t know. (They specifically  <br/>
say to talk about experience of any kind of alternative education.)<br/>

I was trying not to identify anything about the poster, so I said she  <br/>
was wrong but didn&#39;t say what state (though I knew).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s school that makes people so emotional about unschooling,  <br/>
whether they love it or hate it.  Something about the existence of  <br/>
unschooling causes people to dissolve inside.  All the beliefs and  <br/>
justifications we&#39;ve lived with about what we went through and how we  <br/>
were judged and how we were punished for not finishing homework, and  <br/>
the shame and bullying some of us  experienced (or dished out), and  <br/>
the relationships with parents and siblings that were triangulated on  <br/>
school and teachers and grade levels...  Some people side with that  <br/>
against any challenges.  They don&#39;t want to restructure their innards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the shame and bullying some of us  experienced (or dished out)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t dish it out - I was a sensitive and kind and gentle kid. I  <br/>
was easily embarrassed. I blushed a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get bullied, because I was athletic, smarter than average but  <br/>
not a genius, and normal looking.<br/>
<br/>
But I did largely ignore the bullying and meanness that was around me  <br/>
- I didn&#39;t defend the quirky, or klutsy, or not-too-bright, or odd- <br/>
looking kids who were mercilessly taunted. I felt horrible about it  <br/>
then and I STILL remember a number of incidents in detail. I remember  <br/>
Gail - a very short, dark-haired girl - she was pretty hairy - arms  <br/>
and backs of her hands and stuff. The other kids really really often  <br/>
teased her and said she had cooties and the boys dared each other to  <br/>
pull her hair and (later) to pretend to like her and get her to  <br/>
believe it and then do something mean to her. I remember standing in  <br/>
line outside our classroom and kids were catching ladybugs and  <br/>
surreptitiously sticking them into her frizzy hair.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on. There was a LOT of meanness. I don&#39;t remember being  <br/>
targeted very often, just a little. But I lived in fear of it. And  <br/>
mostly I spent a lot of time feeling horrible for other kids who were  <br/>
being shamed and bullied, and I was always feeling awful about myself  <br/>
for not doing something about it and appearing to condone it by  <br/>
standing by.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems to me that I had very little respect for most adults (I  <br/>
BEHAVED very respectfully, but I didn&#39;t think much of them) because I  <br/>
thought they were the ones who should have stopped all the meanness  <br/>
and they seemed completely oblivious to it. The things kids got  <br/>
punished for were not these insidious extremely hurtful personal  <br/>
attacks, but crimes against the school property or talking back to  <br/>
teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie has been working on a project for Girl Scouts that has to do  <br/>
with bullying (she&#39;s creating a self-defense workshop for adults with  <br/>
developmental disabilities) so I&#39;ve also been doing just a bit of  <br/>
reading about it.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a statement that hit home for me:<br/>
&quot;Bullying today is less about children hitting each other than it is  <br/>
about children being victimized by a culture of meanness.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16lijour.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16lijour.html</a> <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just like we aren&#39;t aware that we&#39;re breathing air, I wasn&#39;t aware of  <br/>
how much meanness I was immersed in, until I was out of it for a long  <br/>
time. In fact, it was not really until my own children grew up barely  <br/>
ever experiencing it - certainly they weren&#39;t living day after day  <br/>
immersed in it.<br/>

saying, &quot;go ask that group if you can join&quot; until there were no groups<br/>
left and I was alone, and making very mean remarks about my naturally<br/>
curly hair.<br/>
<br/>
The one time it *did* turn physical I defended myself, and we *both*<br/>
got punished equally - being made to sit next to one another at lunch.<br/>
To this day I&#39;m not sure why it was okay to let all that go on.<br/>
Perhaps they thought that I&#39;d have to deal with it in the &quot;real<br/>
world&quot;, but the truth is my self esteem probably still suffers from<br/>
that time in my life, and at no other time after I left that school<br/>
did I face anyone so cruel again (thankfully.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it also has something to do with my desire to make everyone<br/>
happy - which is often a no-win situation (I&#39;m not talking my family<br/>
here, but people at large - neighbors, parents, friends, acquaintances...)<br/>
