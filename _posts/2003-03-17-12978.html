<div id="ygrps-yiv-547707790">Hi, my name is Pam. I know nothing about unschooling, but its got to <br/>
work or Im going to start pulling my hair out. We went to public <br/>
schools for 3 yrs. and 1 month homeschooling and thats not working. <br/>
I have a 7 yr. old that was at one time a happy child now not so <br/>
happy. He dislikes everything about school. So I took him out and <br/>
started hs him. He doesnt like that either and I stay stress alot. <br/>
Im not sure how it goes but I will figure it out. We have lots of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your 7 year old went to public school for 3 years?  Sounds like me -- I<br/>
started kindergarten at 4 1/2, WAY too young even for the good old days of<br/>
school in the 60&#39;s - playtime and naptime.<br/>
<br/>
Someone wise once posted &quot;bring your child home, but don&#39;t bring school<br/>
home.&quot;  When my dd stressed out due to my Mom As Teacher routine and I&#39;d<br/>
reached my breaking point, another wise person told me to quit.  Just quit<br/>
homeschooling.  Not put her in school.  Just quit teaching at home and start<br/>
living a normal life, including a 7 y.o. and a 4 y.o.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that will help you figure it out is &quot;The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting,&quot; by Frank Smith.  It will help you understand why what schools<br/>
do all day long is pretty much worthless educationally, and why you don&#39;t<br/>
have to imitate them.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve stumbled onto an &quot;advanced&quot; unschooling board, filled with people<br/>
who&#39;ve answered the basic questions time and again.  It seems like there are<br/>
a number of new posters this month; has the list been mentioned somewhere?<br/>
(Wasn&#39;t there a Far Side cartoon where a kid opens the door of the Teacher&#39;s<br/>
Lounge and finds behind it monsters, smoking?  I feel like one of the<br/>
monsters &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>

hints on how to start this journey.  But I did want to say hi.<br/>
