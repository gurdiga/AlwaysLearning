I added some Teeny Little Super Guy info and links to my art page.   <br/>
Thanks, Jocelyn, for letting me know some of that was available now.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s bored and capable and would like to look and see if you  <br/>
can figure out why there&#39;s a glitch in the html there (if you see  <br/>
one, in there being blank space under the teeny little super guy  <br/>
table (something in or around the &quot;Two Simple Art Games&quot; title), I&#39;d  <br/>
appreciate it.  It&#39;s 4:00ish a.m. and I couldn&#39;t sleep, but I&#39;m not  <br/>
awake enough to find this error, somehow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only glitch I see is with the table that contains &quot;Tie Dye  <br/>
Temple&quot;, &quot;Gallery of Tie-Dyed Art&quot; and &quot;Computer Jigsaw Puzzles&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When the screen is widened, the &quot;Tie Dye Temple&quot; table moves next to  <br/>
the table with &quot;Teeny Little Super Guy&quot;. And then the &quot;Tie Dye  <br/>
Temple&quot; table gets confused. I think because it has percentages in it  <br/>
to tell it how wide to be. When it&#39;s below the &quot;Teeny Little Super  <br/>
Guy&quot; then the 90% for the &quot;Tie Dye Temple&quot; table takes up 90% of the  <br/>
screen. But when it&#39;s next to the &quot;Teeny Little Super Guy&quot; table it  <br/>
runs off the edge of the screen and gets confused about what it&#39;s  <br/>
supposed to be taking 90% of.<br/>
<br/>
You could make &quot;Tie Dye Temple&quot; table a fixed width. Or put it above  <br/>
the &quot;Teeny Little Super Guy&quot; table.<br/>
<br/>
I think the only ways to make the &quot;Tie Dye Temple&quot; table stay below  <br/>
he &quot;Teeny Little Super Guy&quot; table is to put them into a larger table,  <br/>
or connect the two tables.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if that all makes sense!<br/>

the kids were showing me,<br/>
late last night, both the Strongbad as Japanese art and the birth of  <br/>
trogdor bits on Homestarrunner.<br/>
<br/>
Zach (15) who loves Homestarruner was showing those to Zoe (8) who is  <br/>
an artist.  Sweet sibling stuff.<br/>

<br/>
I used to be surprised by coincidences like that but now am more  <br/>
amused and grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend on Saturday, Marty and Holly and I were doing a five hour <br/>
+ drive, and we listened to an old cassette tape of an LP of Little  <br/>
Shop of Horrors.  The intro goes &quot;On the 23rd day of September...&quot;  <br/>
and I&#39;m like &quot;HEY!  What day is this!?&quot;   The kids weren&#39;t sure, but  <br/>
I had the wedding invitation, and there it was... same day.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in that happy sing-along hour, Marty asked who sings Audrey  <br/>
II.  I said Levi Stubbs, from the Four Tops, who wasn&#39;t usually the  <br/>
lead singer, but sang &quot;Bernadette.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Time passed, wedding, reception, touristing, swimming pool, and when  <br/>
we started driving back late the next morning we were too far from  <br/>
regular radio stations.  Marty went &quot;search, search,&quot; and found an El  <br/>
Paso oldies station.  The second song they played after we turned it  <br/>
on was Bernadette, by The Four Tops.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273661036">Wow, I&#39;d never visited the art page, either, what a great collection  <br/>
of links.<br/>
<br/>
It also explains the name of the restaurant in Monsters, Inc.,  <br/>
Harryhausen&#39;s : ) - I can always hear Billy Crystal&#39;s voice lingering  <br/>
over the &quot;ow&quot; in Harryhausen&#39;s when he says it.<br/>
