<div id="ygrps-yiv-343738230">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
a fun pro TV watching story.<br/>
<br/>
My son (18) has watched all the House (MD hospital Fox series, probably over 80 <br/>
hours of watching) series the past months, probably triggered by me being in and <br/>
out of the hospital all the time. And when my eye-nerve infection came back he <br/>
said to me, what if it wasn&#39;t Lyme&#39;s disease, but what if it was two different <br/>
things at the same time? Lyme is gone but the eye nerve thing isn&#39;t? We asked my <br/>
doctor the same question, not telling it was Olaf&#39;s House watching, making us <br/>
question this. <br/>
<br/>
They took a fresh look at everything, gathered new data and yesterday we got a <br/>
totally new diagnosis because of it. Lyme&#39;s disease is really gone and the nerve <br/>
infection is a rare symptom of a immune system illness, that can at least be <br/>
treated symptomatically.<br/>
<br/>
We told him that his question made a huge difference, and got a good talk about <br/>
what made House so interesting to him (the logical puzzles) and he suddenly sees <br/>
himself working/studying as information analyzer.<br/>
<br/>
So hurray for excessive TV watching! <br/>
<br/>
Greetings, Josh</div>

Wow, talk about connections!! Good news about the Lyme disease, and that the symptoms of the nerve infection can be treated.<br/>
<br/>

I love when my son gives me that kind of information about shows, books, games, and other things he enjoys! It gives me added insight to his interests, but it also gives me a whole new perspective about a show I might not have otherwise considered watching or a game that I might initially consider too gory for me based on the cover art.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Medical problems can take a certain amount of control away. I know that when I am or a family member is dealing with medical problems, I like to get online and read at various medical websites -- I feel like I have a bit more control when I&#39;m informed about options, pros and cons of medications, etc. Maybe that&#39;s how it feels for your son? <br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of something Sandra posted on Unschooling Partnerships in a discussion about expectations: &quot;Question everything. Think.&quot; Instead of expecting the doctors to think of all the possibilities and have all the answers, your son is gathering and analyzing information so that you all can, individually and as a team with your doctors, question and think. That&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love when I think something my son is interested in watching so much<br/>
of is &quot;just&quot; a game he likes and is into a great deal. I had no idea<br/>
how many Mario games were produced-- it&#39;s not just a couple of them.<br/>
Gosh no! I haven&#39;t tried counting but it&#39;s a LOT. He keeps asking me<br/>
to look up more that I don&#39;t think could exist but they then there<br/>
they are when I look them up. Ha. They are stories built on stories,<br/>
and this leads to fanfic which I have spent tons of time reading to<br/>
Karl. Last night, he came and got me to watch a Bakugan episode with<br/>
him, in which a grown son went back in time to play Bakugan with his<br/>
mother when she was a very young child. I wish I could have heard all<br/>
that was said but even pictorially it was something to see the<br/>
character spending this time with his mom, and the game was a way to<br/>
understand even more someone who he missed. It was more than just a<br/>
game. It was more than neat that Karl especially asked me to watch<br/>
that with him.<br/>
<br/>
I have watched House only like one episode worth and I found myself<br/>
wondering if the things that were happening could really happen in<br/>
real life, and yes they do. Those x-rays of spinal injuries in 1st<br/>
vertebrae (Atlas it&#39;s called) were not exaggerations, as I thought<br/>
they might be. People can actually survive extensive injuries and<br/>
disease processes. I was so skeptical of this when watching ER years<br/>
ago. It&#39;s possible. &#92;&#92;<br/>
<br/>
So glad to hear the Lyme disease is gone! :D I didn&#39;t know that it<br/>
could be over with. That&#39;s fantastic. I was under the impression that<br/>
it wasn&#39;t really gone.<br/>

get your eye problem all cleared up.<br/>

And Hugh Laurie speaking in an American accent! (But, why??? One just <br/>
wonders.)<br/>
<br/>
Just told Rosie your story - love it. We&#39;re also big House fans and, <br/>
yes, it is for the logic puzzle aspect of the show (and Hugh Laurie).<br/>
