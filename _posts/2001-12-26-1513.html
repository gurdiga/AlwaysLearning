<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556779556">Been busy all day RELAXING....aaaah.<br/>
Had a very low key Holiday with just my own kids and dh, it was perfect.<br/>
You all make me appreciate my family so much when you tell these stories <br/>
about gift giving.<br/>
I can not imagine having to deal with coldness like that.<br/>
How on earth is it that you AND your dh had such difficult parents and you <br/>
are both warm and loving with your kids beyond what most parents are? That&#39;s <br/>
really great.<br/>
<br/>
I had some very old video footage (from the 60&#39;s) transferred onto VHS for <br/>
dh. He absolutely loved it! It was so neat to see a burbling, chubby little <br/>
baby that looked just like our little 10 month old. Hard to believe that&#39;s <br/>
the man I married!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a great day. <br/>
I&#39;m off to watch a movie with a plate full of gingerbread cookies and a hot <br/>
mug of Chai tea....life doesn&#39;t get any better than this!<br/>

<br/>
I think it comes from looking at our parents and knowing they could have done <br/>
better very easily if they had just wanted to.<br/>
