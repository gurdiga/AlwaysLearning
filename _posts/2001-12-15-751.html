<br/>
There in lies the generation gap!<br/>
Bill and Monica didn&#39;t have sex either!  Sex isn&#39;t about intercourse these days. Sex is actually about orgasms now, and not just for the guys. Intercourse is dangerous and so it&#39;s a little more serious, I think/hope for most kids! The kids these days have a LOT more info on matters of sexuality and pleasure, and a lot less inhibition, as a result of seeing it everywhere, all the time. They know how to find pleasure without going &quot;all the way&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
They also know how to protect themselves, and fortunately, have better access to information about protection from pregnancy and disease than we did. Does this mean they grow up faster, too fast, I don&#39;t think so. We live in the &quot;age of information&quot;, and even the most diligent parent, determined to &quot;protect&quot; their children, cannot control the sheer magnitude of available info, and distribution sources, constantly bombarding and challenging us.<br/>
<br/>
I think they have a greater and freer opportunity to explore life and relationships and thus a greater chance of leading a rewarding and full life. I believe that the longer childhood is allowed to be enjoyed and explored, without the burden of adult responsibility, the better the chance that one will learn how to be a playful, adventurous, creative, and happy in a life that is difficult and challenging at the best of times. <br/>
<br/>
The simple fact that our life expectancy has changed so dramatically, (when my dad was a boy they expected to live until 60 and now it&#39;s more like 80), gives us this wonderful opportunity to be children for longer. The other thing we have to consider is that childhood is not a static idea and that while it may resemble the image that we have, it is also altogether different. Our children are creating childhood in their own image. They will also live adult lives that may resemble ours in many ways but will be totally different in most ways.  <br/>
