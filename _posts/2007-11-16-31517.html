Maybe tell him to let you try it for a year and see how it goes and  <br/>
if they&#39;re not learning you can try something different, but that  <br/>
during that year you&#39;d like for him to read here:<br/>

It&#39;s not that my site&#39;s not useful, but Joyce&#39;s might appeal more,  <br/>
and will seem like one page (which it isn&#39;t) while mine seems like  <br/>
hundreds (and it is).<br/>
<br/>
I think that will fix it all up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152516810">Just know you&#39;re not alone.  There are many moms out there unschooling to one degree or another with husbands distanced from  this process to one degree or another.  In my little experience,  some of them &#39;come around&#39;. I do firmly agree that is you can get him to read the site joyful learning he will be influenced at least a little.<br/>

other dads too - in addition to reading at Joyce and Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>

<br/>
Part of Unschooling is the willingness to let go of this kind of external <br/>
school-based validation. I don&#39;t know how hard that will be for you or your <br/>
dh. &quot;Above average&quot;, &quot;gifted&quot;, &quot;advanced&quot; - these are all labels that are <br/>
equally as irrelevant to the individual unschooling child&#39;s journey as <br/>
&quot;behind&quot;, &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;late&quot; are. All a child&#39;s intelligences (see Howard <br/>
Gardiner) are celebrated in Unschooling, not just those that look like <br/>
academics.<br/>
<br/>
It is really great to get to the place when these past tests don&#39;t matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863536467">I don&#39;t have much advice as to what to tell your husband, because I&#39;m in the same boat.  My kids are 8 and 10 and have always been unschooled.  DH still asked them several times a week if they did their school work today.  They usually just respond by telling him what they&#39;ve been doing.  He is gradually getting better, but it takes a long time.  When the kids were 4 and 6 he got mad at me because they didn&#39;t know who Christopher Columbus was (even in school I don&#39;t know that they would know at that age)  He still says on a regular basis how much I am doing a disservice for my children and they don&#39;t even know who christopher columbus is(they do know now).  <br/>
Well every couple days I put a trivia question up on our chalk board.  The kids love guessing the answers or looking online to find the answer and write it on board.  It&#39;s just a game we&#39;ve been doing for the last year or so...useless trivia!  The question this week was How much water flows over niagra falls every second?  The kids got books from the library and looked on the internet which led their interests to other things and they actually learned a whole lot more than how much water.  But, DH&#39;s response that he wrote on the board was &quot;why in the world would anyone ever need to know that?&quot;  I asked him why they need to learn half the stuff that parents feel their kids &quot;need&quot; to learn.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;  ...my thoughts exactly.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m rambling on but here is a funny story...One day my son decided that he was done with homeschooling because I asked him to clean his rabbits cage (that was the deal we have every time he gets a new animal, and yes he has a lot and I do help a lot, but we had an agreement and I was busy, so it was his turn to clean it)  He decided he&#39;s going to school.  I told him we could pretend like he was in school and I&#39;d give him work to do and if he did it for 2 weeks and still wanted to go, I&#39;d let him.  Well it lasted about 10 minutes and he snuck into his room to work on a physics project instead of doing the work I gave him to do.  I went in and told him(in a very teacher-like way) if he wants to be in school then he needs to sit at the table and do his work.  He said I just can&#39;t do school, I&#39;m not ready to learn anything!  Well, maybe he didn&#39;t realize he was doing physics!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, my best advice would be to point out to your husband what the kids are doing and what abilities they do have and that might help with his fears.  <br/>
