<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008535316">I believe the same thing as well Tori... I think it&#39;s much more subconscious<br/>
that that.... Of course depending on how we, as individuals have been<br/>
raised, in religious or non-religous, pagan or whatever kinds of families,<br/>
we are going to look at this in different ways.  As I am evolving as a human<br/>
I&#39;m encountering more and more people who are looking to other means to<br/>
figure out why they are here, what is their purpose, what are their lessons<br/>
to learn etc etc, how can my experiences help others with their own pain and<br/>
suffering?  And other thought provoking questions.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that if I am willing to go against the majority of society<br/>
when it comes to unschooling then there has to be other areas of my life<br/>
that could do with a good look at.  I believe I did the circumstances, the<br/>
parents, the place, the lessons that I need to learn in this lifetime.  If I<br/>
don&#39;t resolve those issues, then I&#39;m coming back again to repeat them till I<br/>
get it.  I tried to change everything to speaking in the &quot;I&quot; because that&#39;s<br/>
the person I can really talk about.  When I hear people say &quot;we&quot; (which<br/>
presumably includes me) I always think of what my mother says &quot;We? are you a<br/>
member of the Royal Family or do you have mouse in your pocket?&quot; (LOL)  It&#39;s<br/>
always makes me laugh.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m talking about 2 different levels here.. we choose things<br/>
<br/>
on one level that we are not necessarily consciously aware of... does<br/>
<br/>
that mean blame the victim? Not at all.. it means be aware that<br/>
<br/>
things have a higher purpose than we may be able to realize right now.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Tori<br/>

myself.. perhaps if I confined this discussion only to what I believe <br/>
about *me*, it would make it easier for people to accept (or <br/>
dismiss :-) ).  The only reason I brought up anyone else was because <br/>
the comment was made that the idea of choosing our own parents could <br/>
be dangerous.  Obviously I don&#39;t see it as dangerous to me, I am just <br/>
trying to figure out why it is so dangerous to others.<br/>
<br/>
And on that note, I would like to officially revise my opinion :-)<br/>
From the responses here, I can see that people generally believe that <br/>
children are fresh and new to this world.  If you then take the <br/>
parent-choosing belief and try to apply it to those beliefs that are <br/>
already held, yes I can see the danger in that. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878115134">***This makes the broad assumption that we will only choose lives <br/>
<br/>
that are comfortable.  If that was the case, we would rarely learn <br/>
<br/>
anything, in my opinion. I believe that we choose given much more <br/>
<br/>
information than is consciously available to us in this lifetime. ***<br/>
<br/>
Ah. I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to understand ever, in this life or any <br/>
other, why a soul would choose to be born to a mother who would stuff his <br/>
mouth full of paper within minutes of his birth, tape his nose and mouth <br/>
shut, close him up inside a plastic grocery bag and stuff him onto a shelf <br/>
behind the towels before going back to bed. I don&#39;t even want to imagine what <br/>
he came to learn. And what&#39;s that mother soul here to learn? Maybe she <br/>
finally got it.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.<br/>
