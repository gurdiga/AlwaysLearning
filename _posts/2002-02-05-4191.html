<div id="ygrps-yiv-693776987">&lt;&lt;&lt;When Kirby was younger I had more dramatic angst, because I felt <br/>
the pressure <br/>
of relatives. It&#39;s all gone now. I&#39;ll probably feel it some more when <br/>
he&#39;s <br/>
18 and in college or not&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh! We are there, again, not 18 but, &quot;Your not gonna h/s high school? <br/>
Are you? (!)...And is that 9 yr. old reading YET!????....<br/>
<br/>
FIL who I (or is it whom?) really adore is sincerely troubled, that <br/>
maybe his granddaughter (soon to be 15) will be cheated out of a <br/>
college education <br/>
because of the lack of *proper* transcripts...And sure his grandson <br/>
is bright but there is one problem, he can&#39;t read..FIL thinks it is <br/>
maybe because he is lazy and has a big brother to read things to <br/>
him...Hmmm.. I always thought it was a benefit that his older <br/>
brother had the patience and the kind heart to take time and help his <br/>
younger brother (setting a beautiful example for younger brother to <br/>
boot).  So what I believe to be an assest is seen by others as a <br/>
liability....Go figure...<br/>
