<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873056519"><p><span>Yesterday there was a shooting on the street right outside our local playground.&nbsp; It is most likely gang-related and is the third in the past week in our neighborhood.&nbsp; My daughter (6)&nbsp;and I were not at the playground at the time.&nbsp; She does not have any knowledge of these shootings.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>This morning another unschooling mom and friend called me to say that she had been contacted by another parent (not unschooling) who wants to organize some sort of &quot;safety-awareness teaching event&quot; for children in the neighborhood and wants my friend&#39;s input and assistance&nbsp;on it.&nbsp; My friend is very active in a local parents groups here and that is why she is being contacted.&nbsp; She called me, as one unschooler to another, to ask for advice on how to respond.&nbsp; I have not had a chance talk with her today.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>My question is if and how to talk with my daughter about the situation as it is likely that she will hear of it through other&nbsp;children and/or their parents. The situation in the neighborhood will likely escalate as warm weather comes and folks are out on the street more.&nbsp; While Chicago does have ongoing gang violence issues, it is a new development to have these&nbsp;events occurring quite literally in our back yard.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>I am going to do a search on this and other unschooling sites about responses to violent events but I would appreciate hearing others&#39;&nbsp; experiences, ideas and recommendations.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p><p><span>Anita</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260674111">What education will help kids be safer?<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine what it will involve other than scaring kids who aren&#39;t scared.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would not participate, and would discourage the other mom from participating.   <br/>
<br/>
Too many parent make noise and motion that causes more damage than good.  It makes them feel important, maybe, and self-righteous, but if a police force can&#39;t prevent violence, a parent group can&#39;t, either.  And a scared kid is just as UNlikely to be shot as a happy kid.  So I would go with happiness and risk, rather than the SURE unhappiness that will come (with nightmares) from scaring little children in detail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894140712">Sandra, thank you.&nbsp; As it happens, I was&nbsp;reading (again)&nbsp;your essay on Noisy Peace just the day before this happened. Then, when&nbsp;I was taking some time to think through what I wanted to say to my friend, your description of Holly sleeping peacefully and thus adding peace to the world came to my mind.&nbsp; I imagined the anxiety and fretfulness that some of the parents might pass on to their children by trying to &quot;teach&quot; them to be safe.&nbsp; So your words helped twice. &nbsp;I am going to jot down&nbsp;these ideas so that I can reach for them&nbsp;when the shootings come up in parents&#39;&nbsp;playground gossip, I can also choose to&nbsp;add peace.<br class="ygrps-yiv-894140712yui-cursor"><div class="ygrps-yiv-894140712ygroups-quoted"><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-894140712ygrps-yiv-513195031"><br></div></div></div>
