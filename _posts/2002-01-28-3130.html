&lt;&lt; Does anyone else think that? Sandra recently said<br/>
something to the effect that she&#39;s allergic to bullshit. Well, I&#39;m<br/>
allergic to ugliness, and I try not to keep ugly things around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are ugly books, and books with ugly things in them, and so you choose <br/>
the books you don&#39;t think are ugly.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s some ugly stuff on TV doesn&#39;t mean anyone has to or will <br/>
want to watch it.  There&#39;s also some wonderful stuff there.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids can tell the difference between what is ugly and beautiful, they <br/>
will chose beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
If the parent can allow them to look at something the PARENT thinks is ugly <br/>
(GI Joe?  skateboards with flaming demon heads?  pierced-face rock&#39;n&#39;roll <br/>
bands with torn-up-looking hair?) then the parent doesn&#39;t have to look, and <br/>
can let the child make his own aesthetic judgments.<br/>
<br/>
But if the parent defines ugly and stupid for the child, the child might well <br/>
develop a curiosity about and a fascination with WHY the parent would be so <br/>
adamant that a certain thing was wrong or bad.  And upon discovering that not <br/>
all those things are going to grab you adn eat you in the dark, the child <br/>
loses some confidence in the parents&#39; judgments. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just describing what happened to hundreds of thousands of people my age <br/>
growing up, whose parents told them what to wear, how to have their hair, how <br/>
to sit, what to say in each social meeting, what to eat and when and how to <br/>
chew it, what music was &quot;good&quot; and what was &quot;bad.&quot;  The kids left home as <br/>
quickly as possible, became hippies or bikers or whatever, and let totally <br/>
loose with sex and drugs.  That&#39;s not maybe, that happened.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not wise in the terminology of physics, but I&#39;ve been around real <br/>
catapults and trebuchets (and miniature ones too, designed for table-top use <br/>
in food fights, but those are really rude).  If there&#39;s not a great force <br/>
pulling something back and holding it down, there can be no huge <br/>
high-velocity escape vector.<br/>
<br/>
If kids have lax, sweet freedom, they can&#39;t go very far or very fast.  If <br/>
they have limitations, the resistence builds up and builds up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But if you talk about your tastes and values to<br/>
your children and around them, they are likely to accept them as their<br/>
own; at least, those of them that you&#39;re most passionate about.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be the amount of talking, but the truth in it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And it&#39;s harder to be passionate about not watching too much TV (what&#39;s<br/>
too much, anyway?) than not watching any at all, in my opinion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is Shakespeare on stage uglier and more sinful than Shakespeare in the book?<br/>
<br/>
The same characters and situations and philosophical questions that kids can <br/>
get from novels are also found in movies and dramas and comedies.  The same <br/>
happiness kids can get from an illustration in a book can be had from seeing <br/>
animated cartoons, but there&#39;s also soundtrack, and voice acting.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids know tons of useful and fun things from Animaniacs, Sesame Street, <br/>
Muppet Babies, which they watched as new and watch again on video tape.<br/>
<br/>
Our TV is much more used as a tape player and Nintendo system component than <br/>
for broadcast TV, and we don&#39;t have cable, but my kids&#39; happiness and <br/>
knowledge and joy and long stretches of quiet days without TV are evidence <br/>
that it can be a good part of a good life.<br/>
<br/>
Without having a TV, how do the kids see musicals?  Have they seen Fred <br/>
Astaire dance?  Shirley Temple?  Have they seen ice shows--Disney on Ice, <br/>
Nutcracker on Ice?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d as soon banish books and the computer as banish TV, and I would never <br/>
banish those.<br/>

But if your children discover TV watching NOT to be a passive activity, they <br/>
might think less of your beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first online TV discussions I was ever in had a woman who argued <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s passive.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Our family had just watched The Sound of Music (a really long movie) all <br/>
together, all kids, mom and dad.  We had had A BLAST.  We had been eating and <br/>
discussing, rewinding, singing... I said so.<br/>
<br/>
Icily, she said that HER children were never allowed to talk or sing while a <br/>
video was on because it was RUDE.<br/>
<br/>
WOOHOO!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t allow &#39;active viewing&#39;--they had to sit still or get out.<br/>
<br/>
Many lights went on in me when I read that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525688584">I agree actually :-) . It&#39;s best to express strong opinions in a mild way,<br/>
especially when talking to one&#39;s kids. It&#39;s just easier to use short and<br/>
simple words when you debate something online. Those long stuffy<br/>
euphemisms often fill my head with vapor.<br/>

you to NOT sing the &quot;Friends&quot; theme song. <br/>
