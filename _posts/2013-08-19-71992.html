<div id="ygrps-yiv-18194936">Hello, <br/>
I know this isn&#39;t strictly an unschooling question but I&#39;m struggling to find a way to support this interest and thought I might get some help here. <br/>
<br/>
My five-year old loves watching videos on youtube of gamers. He&#39;d like to make his own videos. I&#39;ve watched a few tutorials but it makes my head spin. Buying a recording device seems the most straightforward but I don&#39;t want to invest $250 at this stage. Can any of you or your kids recommend the easiest, cheapest way to record Wii U games from an HD TV? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Keelie</div>

You might try searching first since it may have been asked once or twice. If you ask, it&#39;s one topic/interest per post.<br/>
