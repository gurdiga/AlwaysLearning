We are unschoolers and I write and talk about unschooling in Spanish. Sandra knows me a little.

If they wanted to try i would help them...(They have no interest at all)  as what I have told them: my personal reasons explaning why I gave up meat more than 20 years ago. They have been influenced by me as I can&#39;t be who I am not... I know that. In that grup no one could not really help me with this idea on how to deal with this. Are there any vegetarian families who are radical as well in this list? I can&#39;t be radical myself so how could our children be. Another thing is that we eat organic most of the time and avoid sugar and dairy so we don&#39;t offer those foods either. They do eat some at birthday parties or friends houses.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998429872">=== &gt; My question is how can a vegetarian, animalist mum move towards Radical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling if she has strong beliefs about killing and eating animals. Our<br/>
&gt; kids have never eaten fish or meat as we don&#39;t have any at home. They don&#39;t<br/>

&gt; help them...(They have no interest at all)  as what I have told them: my<br/>
&gt; personal reasons explaning why I gave up meat more than 20 years ago. They<br/>
&gt; have been influenced by me as I can&#39;t be who I am not... I know that. ===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m vegan; my partner isn&#39;t, but we don&#39;t cook/have meat in the house.<br/>
My nearly-3yo hasn&#39;t had any meat yet and hasn&#39;t seemed particularly<br/>
interested when other people have had it (eg restaurants) but nor have I<br/>
offered. <br/>
<br/>
My own compromise is what you say above: if Leon expressed an interest,<br/>
I would help him try it out. Which could mean a bunch of things: cooking<br/>
it here (I would really struggle with that; my partner might be happy to<br/>
do it), going to a restaurant, going to a friend&#39;s house, buying<br/>
something that doesn&#39;t need cooking like ham, something else I haven&#39;t<br/>
thought of yet... <br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t think that I need to deliberately introduce him to<br/>
meat/fish; other people eat it in front of him, it&#39;s in the supermarket<br/>
when we go shopping, it&#39;s in films and books. I will tell him, if he<br/>
asks, why I don&#39;t eat it, and that other people make different choices.<br/>
If he wants to try it I would do my best to facilitate that cheerfully<br/>
and certainly not to criticise or shame him about it. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think the mom needs to &quot;help them&quot; so much as to cook meat in her house.  If the child is interested in having what another family is having, he could eat over there at another house.<br/>
<br/>
If a family&#39;s religion prohibits caffein, a parent doesn&#39;t need to help a child get some coffee or coca-cola.  If a family&#39;s religions prohibits pork, unschoolers don&#39;t need to help a child try some.  Alcohol is easier, because it&#39;s not legal for them to encourage or enable a child to have it (generally speaking—it wouldn&#39;t be just because a child in a non-drinking family &quot;wanted to try it&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian doesn&#39;t have alcohol in her home, for religions reasons.  She didn&#39;t tell her children she would disown them if they ever touched alcohol.  She said they couldn&#39;t bring it to her house.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s religion or &quot;strongly held belief&quot; (for a category of non-negotiable whatever) keeps unschooling from working for some reason, that person should adapt or use whatever parts of unschooling she wants (if any).  If unschooling can&#39;t be a family&#39;s primary focus, there&#39;s no law against that, but for discussions of my own, I wouldn&#39;t want them advising others if what they were saying was that compromised unschooling, mostly unschooling, was as good as relaxed, whole unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a requirement to provide everything in the whole wide world, but to accept that a child is separate and will continue to learn and make choices even outside the parents&#39; home.<br/>

<br/>
Right!<br/>
<br/>
I think it would hurt unschooling if a parent so focussed on veganism or vegetarianism as a sort of political stance or religion and TAUGHT a child that it was the only right, good moral thing to be and do, and that other people were cruel sinners ingesting poison, that they didn&#39;t care about the planet, that they were sadistic war-mongering idiots (or any subset of that, or any larger version of that).<br/>
<br/>
Scaring young children, politicizing young children, causing them to feel that their neighbors and relatives and a horde of strangers are to be despised and feared.... THAT will harm unschooling by making their world small and horrifying.<br/>

ACK!  Potentially ambiguous.<br/>
Cooking meat is going too far, I mean.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665116349">We have been meat eaters, vegetarian, and or vegan at several different points....We also have a religious overlap with dietary restrictions on meat and alcohol. In our home, religion is not enforced. As Sandra mentioned, we (parents and religious kids) insist our home be kept according to religious standards-similar to what she described for the Sorooshians. This winter, two kids were craving rotisserie chicken with garlic (local specialty in the mediterranean), one abstained. We have bought take-out chicken (at their request, and also from religiously OK places, organic free range etc etc). Now they said they had enough, and the ones who did not want it were not bothered. We discussed how to meet everyones needs, and not to offend (is it ok to eat it at home, or is it better to eat at the restaurant? Is there some other thing the non meat eaters want from the menu, a &quot;treat&quot;)?&nbsp;<div>I think it is the respectful communication involved in trying, as much as possible, to meet everyones needs in the most peaceful way. For us it really was not much of an issue, and people were considerate of others...but I think it was more the respect and willingness to accomodate one another that made it a non issue.&nbsp;</div></div>
