<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054926727"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Wow!  How did you manage your situation so none of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the adults in the family have to leave the home in<br/>
order to earn the income needed to support the<br/>
family?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago my dh wrote some software as a hobby<br/>
while he taught himself how to trade futures &<br/>
options.  He turned his hobby into his own business. <br/>
We saved up so he could quit his job to try and make<br/>
it work.  We decided we could survive 3 years on our<br/>
savings if we had to.  He quit about a year & a half<br/>
ago and business is growing.  People subscribe to his<br/>
website on a monthly or yearly basis.  He works from<br/>
home, mostly making additions and corrections to the<br/>
website, maybe 8-12 hours a week.  He considers his<br/>
move to self-employment part of his de-schooling<br/>
process.  <br/>

p.s.  he is trained as an electrical engineer and his<br/>
former job was writing algorithyms (sp) for TI<br/>
calculators.<br/>
