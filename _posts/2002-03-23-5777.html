&lt;&lt; painting with your feet or body <br/>
on large paper &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We used to have &quot;face paints&quot; in bottles, and would paint shoes on each <br/>
others&#39; feet, when Marty was little.  He loved that.   Holly missed it.  I <br/>
should look for some more good body paints and show her that trick.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I would get my mom to paint on me with water colors--to <br/>
make me rings and a wristwatch.<br/>
<br/>
There were some advertisements a few years back that had arms and hands <br/>
painted and posed.  I don&#39;t remember if it was wristwatches or what.<br/>
<br/>
We had a dead van in the back yard and Holly painted &quot;hippie art&quot; on it with <br/>
liquid tempera.  Some of the colors faded in the sun, others didn&#39;t.  Some <br/>
washed off more easily when it rained.<br/>
<br/>
If none of that seems fun, maybe painting clay flowerpots would be a break <br/>
from regular activity that would spark some ideas and conversations.  Or <br/>
making flower boxes to put the pots in, or wooden dividers to stick in the <br/>
ground to make flower-bed edges, or big, tall, garrishly-painted stakes for <br/>
rows of something.  Rows don&#39;t have to be marked with little plastic stakes.  <br/>
That&#39;s boring.<br/>
<br/>
Do something different.  Maybe that could be the rule of the day (any day you <br/>
feel in a rut).<br/>
<br/>

been <br/>
hurt by school!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree, and you might not want to perpetuate it with your offspring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other night, Cacie came home covered with tic tac toe boards (used)<br/>
as well as various other graffitti, all in ball point pen. She had a Hug<br/>
Button, which is one of my favorite body graffitis - push the button and<br/>
the person hugs you. Some of her teen friends started it with her, and<br/>
she passed it on to some younger friends, who embeshed the idea with<br/>
other &quot;buttons&quot;. She has always loved writing on herself, and being<br/>
written on....<br/>
<br/>
When she was 2 and 3, I would give her a paintbrush and squirt some<br/>
different colored lotions onto a plate, and then lay on the floor on my<br/>
belly, topless, and let her draw all over my back, and then rub it in to<br/>
&quot;erase&quot;... it was wonderful, she was occupied and happy, I got to relax<br/>
and get a back rub.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of what Tamzin does on a regular basis. She <br/>
often paints wooden boxes with tempura or watercolours. She&#39;s <br/>
painted CD and tape boxes, trinket boxes and storage boxes. <br/>
She says she wants to paint her wooden shelves next. Most of <br/>
them came from IKEA, so they&#39;re raw wood with no finish on <br/>
them - hence very easy to paint with whatever. Watercolours are <br/>
awesome on them - sorta looks like coloured wood stain. She <br/>
wants to plant a garden this year so I will suggest the stakes and <br/>
dividers to her. Thanks for the idea.<br/>
