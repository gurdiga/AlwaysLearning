  I had gone to see a friend from high school (we were<br/>
both living in LA at the time) play with his band at the Troubador<br/>
(sp?).<br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
  LOL! I worked there, as a cocktail waitress, for 8 months in 1987/88! Those were the days of the glamour boys with the big hair and eyeliner &lt;g&gt;. Brings back some fun memories :-)<br/>
