<div id="ygrps-yiv-862164841">Scavenger hunts make great mysteries.  Try hiding things and leaving clues<br/>
with each object for the next object to look for.  If you can figure out<br/>
something that matches a theme your daughter might have an interest in, that<br/>
might be really fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, making up good mysteries; a tall order!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there have been any or these sorts of games targeted at<br/>
a younger age bracket, but you might try researching &quot;Immersive Games&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Alternate Reality Games&quot; (see<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-01/ff_args">http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-01/ff_args</a> for an<br/>
overview article in wired.)  They tend to be games/puzzles/interactive<br/>
fiction where clues are planted online and/or physically in the real<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat similar, you might look into the &quot;geocaching&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I know it&#39;s not advice for how to make up a mystery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529010248">I had some thoughts that aren&#39;t exactly what you asked, but might appeal to your daughter:<br/>
<br/>
My kids have loved playing I spy-type games.  One you could try is to have her look at the <br/>
room, then close her eyes and change something, and then play guessing games, with clues <br/>
or without, until she guesses what&#39;s changed.  You could also play &quot;hot and cold,&quot; where you <br/>
have an object in mind, and the closer she gets, the &quot;hotter&quot; she gets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106241699">I don&#39;t know what your daughter is interested in about mysteries.  It<br/>
sounded from your email that she may be interested in what goes into making<br/>
a mystery.  I absolutely adored reading mysteries when I was a kid.. all the<br/>
Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys you could throw at me was just so fascinating to me.<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple things on how mysteries are made.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about presenting mysteries to an audience by Alfred<br/>
Hitchcock (and maybe the rest of the website (I didn&#39;t look further) has<br/>
more of that kind of thing if she likes it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.on-cue.org.uk/articles16.html">http://www.on-cue.org.uk/articles16.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a writer talking very much along the same lines about more on that<br/>
same subject: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aprilhenrymysteries.com/AHMWTCluesMakeMystery.htm">http://www.aprilhenrymysteries.com/AHMWTCluesMakeMystery.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I thought this was neat (for myself anyway), a mystery writer&#39;s blog:<br/>

If she&#39;s more interested in playing with mysteries, here&#39;s something I saw<br/>
... preteen mystery party kits: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/begm5k">http://tinyurl.com/begm5k</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502512380">Jayn (9) adores and is crazy about mysteries and detectives, especially <br/>
Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. She loved the recent Doctor Who when they met <br/>
Agathe Christie (based on a real event in her life apparently). We have <br/>
many, many ND and Poirot mystery games and other Wii mystery games.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn makes up mystery stories using her dolls and the characters - with <br/>
special clothes that say &quot;detective&quot; to her. Here&#39;s the thing - the made up <br/>
mysteries don&#39;t have to have the complexity or super fab logic of Agatha <br/>
Christie. I have found that it&#39;s ok to just play investigation without <br/>
worrying about actually catching the crook, or for every clue to line up in <br/>
the end.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s scenarios - a theft at an art museum, where the thieves took a <br/>
painting out the skylight. Another - her doll is a detective with an alter <br/>
ego/disguise (so doll play with clothing) investigating a murder in a Paris <br/>
hotel. Another - the theft of fashion designs (which she drew) from a <br/>
designer&#39;s atelier. The only one that has reached the point of being solved <br/>
after many hours of doll play is the Parisian murder. Sometimes my job is to <br/>
be characters in the game, others to take notes of the story for later <br/>
rewriting.<br/>
<br/>
Another game might be a scavenger hunt or a hunt with a series of clues <br/>
hidden in your house and yard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018648089">I am not sure if the game has the same name in the US but Cluedo which is a murder mystery game might interest her. Just discovered on Wikipedia it is called Clue in North America - rundown here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo</a><br/>
