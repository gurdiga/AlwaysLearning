<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832227253">This is what I woke up hearing today (pre-coffee) ;)<br/>
<br/>
Chloe (5) wants me to *order* her a dead frog *kit* so she can do a dissection. Where did she get this idea? <br/>
<br/>
We looked on the internet at some images of dissections. That still wasn&#39;t enough, she wants to order one and do the dissection. Has anyone ordered a *kit* or can you point me in the right direction? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500087439">LOL...well I think this would be so much easier. It seems odd to <br/>
have to pay for a dead animal and I tried the virtual dissection <br/>
with her and she said, &quot;yeah, that&#39;s cool, but I want to *do* it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We live in Huntington Beach, CA and the only road kill I ever see <br/>
around here are maybe skunks and possums. Ummm...nope not for me. <br/>
But thanks for sharing :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348737514">The most recent HEM had an article written by a young homeschooler, sharing her story of dissection.  It wasn&#39;t an unschooling story, but your daughter might enjoy reading it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242614148">That&#39;s compassionate, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Dissecting live ones is for like medical school or psych/master&#39;s or <br/>
Frankenstein.<br/>
<br/>
My mom dissected a mouse once, that she had caught in a trap, because I asked <br/>
her to.   That was a cool thing that she was willing to do that.  It helped <br/>
that she was a hunter who had cleaned her own deer and elk (have to know where <br/>
the liver and such are to get some of that stuff out in the field), and that <br/>
she had grown up with her family butchering chickens and hogs.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I don&#39;t know...   <br/>
I&#39;d find a friend who&#39;d be willing to do it with my kids (who havne&#39;t asked).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941557614">Dissection in high school is one of the things that really turned me off from *science*.  Of course, I now know that there is much more to science than cutting up formaldehyde-infused dead animals, but I didn&#39;t know that then.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how it would be cool and interesting to some people, but definitely not something that everyone must do.<br/>
