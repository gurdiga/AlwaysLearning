**Thank you, Kathryn!  I already feel better now :0).<br/>
<br/>
I was going to email you - if you have any interest in a reptile show at the<br/>
conference next year, I saw a wonderful one the other day.  The presenters<br/>
were so respectful towards the children it was amazing.  It was very hands<br/>
on, and a lot of fun.  They&#39;re a non-profit group and told me they&#39;ll travel<br/>
anywhere in MA for a homeschooling group.  Let me know if you want their<br/>
contact info.    ~Rue<br/>

will be.&quot;<br/>
