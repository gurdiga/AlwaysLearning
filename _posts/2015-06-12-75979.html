<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397338199">This group/discussion/list is old.   It was founded in 2001.  It might have been busier, but I was writing in more than one yahoogroup at the time.  So were many others.  The busiest months have had over 1000 posts.  Because I have stressed that each post should be useful, and we have not allowed fluff posts, those are some serious numbers.  The lightest month had 44 posts, but there have been ten months over the years with over 1000 posts.   Hundreds of posts a month, on average.<br/>
<br/>
Why does that matter?  <br/>

Those who really want to do well here—to learn the most and to be the most helpful—should read the policies and some of the description and history.  There&#39;s a link on the main page at yahoogroups, but here:<br/>

On the page about posting (linked there), there is a list that&#39;s been around for all or most of the history of this group.<br/>
<br/>
ALL posts should be<br/>
	• honest<br/>
	• proofread<br/>
	• sincere<br/>

Someone wrote to me on the side today:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Trying to be clear and trying to be brief at the same time is making this difficult.  Both times, I meant ... [some qualification that did not show in the statements]. People would be wrong if they called me dishonest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to know what the truth is to know when someone is being dishonest if she writes (in writing, where she could have proofread) one clear statement, and then writes a statement that contradicts the first one.    It doesn&#39;t matter to me which is which.  What matters to me is that the person should be more careful, more thoughtful, clearer in her own thoughts and in her analysis (privately pondered or publicly shared), for her own benefit, and for the benefit of her children.<br/>
<br/>
No post to this group should be dishonest, a rushed-off first draft, insincere or murky/muddy/confusing.<br/>
ALL posts should be honest, proofread, sincere and clear.<br/>

At first, more time and attention than &#39;work.&#39;  And after a while, better writing will come more easily.  <br/>

It&#39;s the same process as any other kind of growth and change we talk about here—make the better choice.  Doing it the first time might seem awkward.  Doing it the 500th time might feel like flying.<br/>
