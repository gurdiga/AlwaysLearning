<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125225501">Mixing water with sidewalk chalk *might* work but what would work  <br/>
wonderfully is to use sidewalk chalk on a wet sidewalk.  Spray the  <br/>
sidewalk  first, or even just pour water out first, and the chalk will  <br/>
look BEAUTIFUL.<br/>

<br/>
Depends whose sidewalk it is.  If it belongs to your family, go for  <br/>
it.  If you&#39;re renting, or it&#39;s part of landscaping of an apartment  <br/>
building or it&#39;s a public sidewalk, that might not come off well at all.<br/>
<br/>
Tempera paints or water colors would work and come off pretty easily  <br/>
with a hose.<br/>

<br/>
I figured that&#39;s what you meant, but what you wrote seemed to suggest  <br/>
that outside of school, comparisons were unnatural or unhealthy, and I  <br/>
disagree.  Within each of Gardner&#39;s intelligences, I think  the better  <br/>
a person is in that area, the more likely he or she is to know who&#39;s  <br/>
better.  I can&#39;t tell which football player is better than another,  <br/>
but I see who writes better than I do and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Part of one&#39;s own self image is knowing where one&#39;s stands in various  <br/>
ways.  Part of healthy humility is knowing some people can do some  <br/>
things better than others, and not being emotional about it, but just  <br/>
accepting it and maybe even appreciating it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119872011">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; School, with grades and emphasis on uniform achievement encourages <br/>
comparison and competition, that&#39;s all.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the point is here. If self-comparison is something that <br/>
occurs amongst unschooling siblings, in the absence of school attendance, <br/>
then it seems illogical to blame school for that particular event. We all <br/>
know that schools create and encourage all kinds of effects, beliefs, <br/>
self-image issues, peer issues including comparison and competition - <br/>
avoiding those negative characteristics of school is one of the reason we <br/>
unschool. Generally I find talking about what&#39;s great about unschooling <br/>
helps me feel a lot better than rehashing all that&#39;s wrong with school.<br/>
<br/>
I only have one child. But something that I have noticed, in a very striking <br/>
way at conferences, is how mutually supportive unschooling siblings often <br/>
appear. This is especially noticeable as they get a bit older - teens and <br/>
nearly teens. I personally have witnessed this time and again. Someone makes <br/>
a complimentary comment about one person&#39;s art work, and the child <br/>
immediately says &quot;you should see what my sister does&quot;. Siblings boast about <br/>
each other. They talk each other up. It&#39;s not competition - it&#39;s teamwork. <br/>
It&#39;s very moving.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that is partly a function of the amount of time the kids are <br/>
spending with their parents (ie not always competing for very limited time <br/>
with mom and dad), as well as the absence of external competitive factors <br/>
like grades that are so often prominent in conventional family situations, <br/>
real and fictional. This along with avoiding the kind of labelling <br/>
conventional parents will do all unthinkingly and humorously - &quot;this one is <br/>
our clever kid, but her sister is our athlete&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The story didn&#39;t strike me as Rosie comparing herself to Roxana in a <br/>
competitive way, but just that she hadn&#39;t considered Roxana might be <br/>
interested in the gig until Pam thought of it. It seems like Rosie&#39;s writing <br/>
interests up until now have been focussed in various fiction endeavors <br/>
rather than academic writing. There is ample room for both kinds of writing, <br/>
and more, in the world. You have only to ask Stephen King or J.K. Rowling <br/>
which kind pays best at the top...(not that this is the first consideration <br/>
in following your bliss).<br/>
<br/>
Still, it&#39;s nice to be asked, even if you don&#39;t want the job. Nice to <br/>
discover a new talent about yourself. Nice to be complimented.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rosie didn&#39;t think of herself as a good writer in the sense of writing <br/>
college term papers, and Roxana is really good at it. Rox is a person <br/>
who really enjoys the academic life (ironically, I guess, having been <br/>
unschooled from 7 years old on). She truly loves college. She ENJOYS <br/>
doing her class assignments, for the most part. She has been a very <br/>
word-oriented person since she was about 3 years old when she began <br/>
reading quite fluently, on her own. Rosie is proud of her and admires her.<br/>
<br/>
What I was saying is that Rosie didn&#39;t think of herself as a <br/>
particularly good (college paper) writer, because she was only familiar <br/>
with Roxana&#39;s writing and didn&#39;t have any way of knowing how she&#39;d stack <br/>
up compared to other college students since this is her first class that <br/>
required this kind of writing.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie doesn&#39;t feel jealous or competitive with Roxana at all; she  knows <br/>
that Rox writes and analyzes really well and gets really high grades and <br/>
lots of positive comments from professors regarding her writing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Still, it&#39;s nice to be asked, even if you don&#39;t want the job. Nice to<br/>

I think Robyn is right that unschooled siblings tend to be unusually <br/>

relative strengths.<br/>

supportive of each other and rather matter-of-fact about each others&#39;<br/>

<br/>
For us it seems to have naturally arising from the attitude (learned  <br/>
from my La Leche League leaders in 1986) of being partners and not  <br/>
adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
As the team grew to five, from two or three, as the others were born,  <br/>
and that principle continued to be one of the best I&#39;d ever learned,  <br/>
the kids felt themselves to part of a partnership, too.   They offer  <br/>
to help each other.  They ask for assistance, or special skills  <br/>
help.   Marty&#39;s very mechanical and can create and creatively repair.   <br/>
Holly&#39;s artistic and gives good advice about clothes and hair which  <br/>
the boys don&#39;t need much, but when they do they go straight to Holly.   <br/>
When they want interpersonal advice they call Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little she was better in some ways at math than the  <br/>
boys were, even then (and none of them are slouches at all).  She  <br/>
could read an analog clock before Kirby and Marty could.  She could  <br/>
figure money out quickly (and nowadays in both her jobs she handles  <br/>
cash and cards and discounts and coupons and specials and all kinds of  <br/>
stuff without batting an eye).  When they&#39;re out with money, from the  <br/>
time they were little to now, it was not unusual for them to pool, or  <br/>
to ask one person to keep all the money and then figure out who still  <br/>
had what when they got home.   Often it was Holly, because she had a  <br/>
purse and is good with such things.<br/>
<br/>
Last night they were telling me a story about Kirby&#39;s ex girlfriend,  <br/>
who&#39;s going out with the older brother of Brett&#39;s ex girlfriend (all  <br/>
part of the same gaming community).   It could have been a snarkfest,  <br/>
but no, the story they were telling is that she&#39;s inconsiderate about  <br/>
tipping, and the new boyfriend backs her up; if she decides not to tip  <br/>
at a restaurant, he won&#39;t either, even when they&#39;re in a group, which  <br/>
makes the whole group look bad and the wait staff has no idea who  <br/>
&quot;didn&#39;t tip,&quot; so it results in just shorting the group she&#39;s with  <br/>
rather than insulting the waitress.<br/>
<br/>
They know each other&#39;s strengths and they&#39;re philosophical about  <br/>
what&#39;s involved in being a good person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839643666">we ended up using a combination of flour, water, and food coloring and drew all over it and under it with sidewalk chalk.  turned out pretty cool.  it is actually on our driveway (which we own).  the kids had fun with it.  thanks for the suggestions.</div>

Did you take photos?  Is it on a blog somewhere? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if those who made the spaghetti through hot dog things  <br/>
might&#39;ve taken photos.  I did!  I was going to make a page linked from  <br/>
monkeyplatters, and maybe mystery art, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible photo use  (if people have photos I could use) is  <br/>
kids sleeping in cute places, or just peacefully or unusually in their  <br/>
own beds.   There are some here:<br/>

It might be fun to add more.  They wouldn&#39;t need to be recent.<br/>
