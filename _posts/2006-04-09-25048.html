<div id="ygrps-yiv-720729890">You have all asked for more specifics, so here are some. I don&#39;t have<br/>
rules about things like bedtimes and how much they play video games or<br/>
watch television, or other things like that. I have always believed in<br/>
trying not to immose unnecessary structure and control on my children.<br/>
My rules are more along the lines of: Don&#39;t run and scream through the<br/>
house,(people get hurt, and this disrespects other people&#39;s space) go<br/>
outside and do it. Clean up after yourself,(being responsible for your<br/>
own messes, this also disrespects other people&#39;s space) put your food<br/>
trash in the trash can, not on the floor. Don&#39;t throw things in the<br/>
house(people get hurt, toys, videos, books and windows get broken, and<br/>
this also disrespects other people&#39;s space). All these types of rules<br/>
have valid reasons behind them, that i do explain to my children over<br/>
and over again. It seems that just understanding why i tell them<br/>
something isn&#39;t enough for them. They will still run through the house<br/>
hurt themselves on furniture and then come screaming to me about it,<br/>
and worst of all, they will yell blame at the furniture for hurting<br/>
them, when THEY ran into It. I will say &quot;It&#39;s not the dresser&#39;s fault<br/>
you got hurt. The dresser didn&#39;t move, you ran into it because you<br/>
were runing in the house and not paying attention to what you were<br/>
doing and what is around you&quot;.<br/>
My children break their things on purpose, hit and yell at each other,<br/>
call names, throw tantrums, refuse to do what i ask them. They don&#39;t<br/>
listen well and i have to say everything several times, just to get<br/>
their attention. I just don&#39;t understand how my husband and i have<br/>
caused all of it. We take care of our belongings. We don&#39;t hit and<br/>
scream at each other. In a lot of ways we set good examples. I will<br/>
admit that we both lose our tempers eventually and yell at the boys,<br/>
but never name calling, insults or cutdowns. And they aren&#39;t paying us<br/>
any attention at all before we get to the point of yelling. We have<br/>
both been reading a book lately titled Scream Free Parenting, and<br/>
trying to incorporate the methods it teaches into our parenting, but<br/>
you can&#39;t perfect anything over night.<br/>
I try to be responsible for my own actions and not blame others when<br/>
things don&#39;t go right for me. I try to respect other people and their<br/>
space, but my children don&#39;t seem to pick any of it up. My husband and<br/>
i don&#39;t cut each other, or the kids off in conversation, but they<br/>
interupt us talking constantly. When we accidently make mistakes<br/>
against other people we apologize immediately. I know most of their<br/>
behavior must be my fault, but i can only find certain mistakes i make<br/>
to link it to. I know i&#39;m not just horrible. I know i have to be doing<br/>
some things right.<br/>
Here is an example of a normal situation that happened at my house. I<br/>
bought my kids big plastic magnifying glasses and a bug house, so they<br/>
could observe bugs. A couple weeks later i found one of the magnifying<br/>
glasses destroyed in the backyard. This really upset me. I asked my<br/>
older son who broke it, and he said that he and his borther had. I<br/>
asked why. He said he didn&#39;t know why. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to be able to<br/>
look at bugs?&quot; i asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Well then, why did you break<br/>
your magnifying glass?&quot; i asked. &quot; I don&#39;t know,&quot; he replied again.<br/>
&quot;Okay, well this really upsets me, i don&#39;t buy you things just so you<br/>
can break them, you need to learn to think before you do things, do<br/>
you want to just not have things, cause when you break your stuff you<br/>
just won&#39;t have any stuff, you&#39;re grounded.&quot; Then he proceeds to throw<br/>
a tantrum because i told him he was grounded from his playstation for<br/>
the rest of the day. I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can go<br/>
in his room and do it or get in time out. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
grounded!&quot; he&#39;s yelling repeatedly. &quot;Well i&#39;m sorry, but if you don&#39;t<br/>
want to be grounded then don&#39;t break your stuff on purpose,&quot; i say. It<br/>
goes on and on until i&#39;m telling him to get in time out because he<br/>
won&#39;t calm down or go in his room. When my children refuse to get in<br/>
time out we count to three. If we get to three before they move that&#39;s<br/>
when we spank. I don&#39;t see how i&#39;m handling this situation<br/>
incorrectly. I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff, i explain how<br/>
it makes me feel, i listen to his feelings of not wanting to be<br/>
punished, but then tell him i understand his feelings, and that<br/>
through different actions he could have avoided that consequence.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that teaching them to be responsible for their actions? And had<br/>
i asked him to pick up the broken pieces on the ground he would have<br/>
tried to refuse doing that unless i had threatened him more. Obviously<br/>
i&#39;m making mistakes, i just don&#39;t understand what they are or what to<br/>
do instead.</div>

Ditto, above.  They&#39;re young to clean up after themselves and &quot;be  <br/>
responsible for&quot; their own messes.  YOU chose to have children, so in  <br/>
a way it&#39;s your mess.  And if you continue with harsh punishments  <br/>
(which I know you&#39;re trying to get away from, which is great), your  <br/>
mess could turn into juvenile delinquency or to an abusive boyfriend  <br/>
or husband, a mean friend or hateful neighbor.  (I have a mean  <br/>
neighbor who was undoubtedly treated badly by her own mother.  I hear  <br/>
her be hateful to her daughter and granddaughter without pause,  <br/>
without apology, all the time.)<br/>

That page has a great little bit by Joyce Fetteroll about saying yes  <br/>
instead of no.  Instead of &quot;Don&#39;t throw things in the house&quot; you  <br/>
could say &quot;Let&#39;s go to the park and throw things!&quot;    Boys NEED to  <br/>
throw things.  Boys&#39; mothers need to help them find safe places and  <br/>
good things to throw.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. All these types of rules<br/>
have valid reasons behind them, that i do explain to my children over<br/>
and over again.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re saying something over and over again, you must have said it  <br/>
wrong the third or fourth time.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It seems that just understanding why i tell them<br/>
something isn&#39;t enough for them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think they understand what you mean?<br/>
Or do you mean they understand why you tell them what to do so much?<br/>
<br/>
-=-They will still run through the house<br/>
hurt themselves on furniture and then come screaming to me about it,<br/>
and worst of all, they will yell blame at the furniture for hurting<br/>
them, when THEY ran into It. I will say &quot;It&#39;s not the dresser&#39;s fault<br/>
you got hurt. The dresser didn&#39;t move, you ran into it because you<br/>
were runing in the house and not paying attention to what you were<br/>
doing and what is around you&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if you sympathized and held the child and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry you  <br/>
got hurt.  Here...&quot; and helped him the same way you would help an  <br/>
adult guest who might have gotten hurt at your house?  Ice pack, or  <br/>
bandage, or soft place to sit, and sympathy?  Then when he&#39;s calm and  <br/>
feeling loved, and you&#39;re calm you *MIGHT* add &quot;That&#39;s why we ask you  <br/>
not to run in the house.&quot;   But you probably wouldn&#39;t have to add any  <br/>
such thing.<br/>
<br/>
You add insult to injury, literally, by shaming him and telling him  <br/>
it&#39;s his fault, as though you&#39;re glad he got hurt, and he deserved it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My children break their things on purpose, hit and yell at each  <br/>
other,<br/>
call names, throw tantrums, refuse to do what i ask them. They don&#39;t<br/>
listen well and i have to say everything several times, just to get<br/>
their attention. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what it seems like to me:<br/>
They need better attention.  They need LOTS of it.  They  need not to  <br/>
be left alone so much, but to be with you and their dad more, either  <br/>
all together or one-on-one in varying combinations.  They need to be  <br/>
spoken to the way you would speak to a friend, an adult, a stranger,  <br/>
a guest.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not listening well.  They&#39;re trying to get your attention, but  <br/>
you just keep droning on with the same messages, instead of REALLY  <br/>
listening to what they need, and being their partners in life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We take care of our belongings. We don&#39;t hit and<br/>
scream at each other. -=-<br/>
<br/>
But you hit and scream at the boys and they&#39;re hitting and screaming.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I will admit that we both lose our tempers eventually and yell at  <br/>
the boys,<br/>
but never name calling, insults or cutdowns. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you were a guest in someone&#39;s home and he started yelling at you,  <br/>
would it really matter exactly what the words were?  The intent and  <br/>
emotion would be clear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And they aren&#39;t paying us any attention at all before we get to  <br/>
the point of yelling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Soon they might not be paying attention even when you are yelling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I try to be responsible for my own actions and not blame others when<br/>
things don&#39;t go right for me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Even when it involves your children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I try to respect other people and their<br/>
space, but my children don&#39;t seem to pick any of it up. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You need to respect THEM, your children, and THEIR space.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-When we accidently make mistakes<br/>
against other people we apologize immediately.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you apologize to them after you ground them or yell at them or  <br/>
spank them?<br/>
Or do you (I&#39;m guessing from the way I was treated, and others have  <br/>
been treated) blame them and say you wouldn&#39;t have yelled, but it&#39;s  <br/>
their fault?  You didn&#39;t want to spank them, but you had no choice?<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Okay, well this really upsets me, i don&#39;t buy you things just so you<br/>
can break them, you need to learn to think before you do things, do<br/>
you want to just not have things, cause when you break your stuff you<br/>
just won&#39;t have any stuff, you&#39;re grounded.&quot; Then he proceeds to throw<br/>
a tantrum because i told him he was grounded from his playstation for<br/>
the rest of the day-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on his side.<br/>
<br/>
Did you buy them magnifying glasses (they broke one and still had  <br/>
one, so your frustration wasn&#39;t about them not being able to look at  <br/>
bugs, really) so they could go and do something and leave you alone?   <br/>
You didn&#39;t write about going to look at bugs with them.  And it took  <br/>
you two weeks to know it was broken, so you also probably didn&#39;t ask  <br/>
how it went, or help them find a good place to keep their new stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal in life is to train your kids to do what you say, it&#39;s  <br/>
not working out very well.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is going to be creating a homelife in which they can  <br/>
feel safe and learn from everything around them, then &quot;grounding him  <br/>
from his playstation&quot; isn&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is to have a good relationship with your children, and  <br/>
you maintain your defense of the adversarial life you&#39;ve set up, it  <br/>
will go from the bad it is now to worse.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can go<br/>
in his room and do it or get in time out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You send them away from you a lot.   Lots.  I think they need their  <br/>
mom, and a nice mom, who&#39;s sympathetic and cares more about them than  <br/>
about plastic magnifying glasses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff, i explain how<br/>
it makes me feel,-=-<br/>
<br/>
You care WAY more about how it makes you feel than how you&#39;re making  <br/>
him feel.  That might be the crux of the problem.  It&#39;s about you.   <br/>
YOU want them to do this or that because of the way it makes you  <br/>
feel.  Your threats are cruel.  You&#39;ve made them small and  <br/>
powerless.  You can&#39;t perfect anything overnight, but you can abandon  <br/>
cruelty in a heartbeat if you want to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- i listen to his feelings of not wanting to be<br/>
punished, but then tell him i understand his feelings, and that<br/>
through different actions he could have avoided that consequence.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a &quot;consequence,&quot; it was your chosen punishment.  You&#39;re  <br/>
making lots of choices and blaming your children for them.<br/>
<br/>
People here can help!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some other things to read.  Please, do click on the links  <br/>
above and read them.  If you had met some of the kids talked about  <br/>
there, you would read it avidly.  Children and parents can have a  <br/>
really sweet relationship, a gentle relationship, and it doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
they&#39;ll be running and screaming and breaking things.  It can be better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911050295">So one one hand you expect your children to understand the natural <br/>
consequences in cases like this...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I will say &quot;It&#39;s not the dresser&#39;s fault<br/>
&gt;you got hurt. The dresser didn&#39;t move, you ran into it because you<br/>
&gt;were runing in the house and not paying attention to what you were<br/>
&gt;doing and what is around you&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But then you also expect them to understand consequences like this<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Okay, well this really upsets me, i don&#39;t buy you things just so you<br/>
&gt;can break them, you need to learn to think before you do things, do<br/>
&gt;you want to just not have things, cause when you break your stuff you<br/>
&gt;just won&#39;t have any stuff, you&#39;re grounded.&quot; Then he proceeds to throw<br/>
&gt;a tantrum because i told him he was grounded from his playstation for<br/>
&gt;the rest of the day. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is absolutely no logical, natural or reasonable connection between <br/>
a broken magnifying glass and a playstation.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems to me that there is way too much emphasis here on afixing <br/>
blame and fault to things.<br/>
<br/>
When a child is hurting s/he needs love and a cuddle and a bandaid - not <br/>
a blaming lecture. When her / his needs for comfort are met, the child <br/>
will be free to learn the lesson about running inside all by his / her <br/>
self. But if his/her mind and heart are filled with anger and misery <br/>
becuase &#39;mother doesn&#39;t care about my hurt, only about furniture / <br/>
rules&#39; there is no room for larning about the natural consequence of <br/>
running inside.<br/>
<br/>
And as for the magnifer - the lesson will be learnt when the child wants <br/>
to use it. If the child never wants to use a magnifying glass, the loss <br/>
is unimportant. If they do, they will learn that smashing it was a not <br/>
such a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is, that it doesn&#39;t sound to me like they are breaking <br/>
their stuff, but rather they are breaking your stuff. The way you talk <br/>
about it, you don&#39;t actually regard it as their stuff, you haven&#39;t given <br/>
over ownership and therefore responsibility of it to them. Why should it <br/>
upset you so much if it was truely theirs in the first place? Why should <br/>
breaking one part of their stuff, mean that you take away something else <br/>
- the playstation - which should be theirs also, but obviously isn&#39;t. If <br/>
you gave your neighbour a present, and she broke it, would you rant at <br/>
her and then go and take away her playstation as punishment? I don&#39;t <br/>
think so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can go<br/>
&gt;in his room and do it or get in time out. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt;grounded!&quot; he&#39;s yelling repeatedly. &quot;Well i&#39;m sorry, but if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to be grounded then don&#39;t break your stuff on purpose,&quot; i say. It<br/>
&gt;goes on and on until i&#39;m telling him to get in time out because he<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t calm down or go in his room. When my children refuse to get in<br/>
&gt;time out we count to three. If we get to three before they move that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;when we spank. I don&#39;t see how i&#39;m handling this situation<br/>
&gt;incorrectly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s about power. It&#39;s about ownership. It&#39;s about this brave little boy <br/>
trying to retain ownership of himSelf. It&#39;s about you trying to retain <br/>
ownership of him and ervything else. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t see it that way. <br/>
I didn&#39;t see it that way either when I was using these sorts of <br/>
parenting techniques. But they don&#39;t work. Truely they don&#39;t. Even if <br/>
you beat him into apparent submission, he will eventually get old enough <br/>
to break away and will then have problems because he won&#39;t have had the <br/>
chance to develop understandings of the world and his inner being that <br/>
will help him make good choices.<br/>
<br/>
or he will be so broken he won&#39;t be able to function without someone <br/>
telling him what to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff, i explain how<br/>
&gt;it makes me feel, i listen to his feelings of not wanting to be<br/>
&gt;punished, but then tell him i understand his feelings, and that<br/>
&gt;through different actions he could have avoided that consequence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t actually see much evidence of you listening to their feelings at <br/>
all. When they hurt themselves on the furniture, you tell them it&#39;s <br/>
their fault.<br/>
<br/>
When you found the broken glas, you didn&#39;t ask how it got broken - you <br/>
asked who broke it. You didn&#39;t ask how they felt about the broken glass, <br/>
you told them how you felt about it. You say you are sorry he&#39;s grounded <br/>
when he doesn&#39;t want to be, that you understand - then why do it? It <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like you are sorry to me because you are the only one with <br/>
the power here - so why do it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Isn&#39;t that teaching them to be responsible for their actions? And had<br/>
&gt;i asked him to pick up the broken pieces on the ground he would have<br/>
&gt;tried to refuse doing that unless i had threatened him more. Obviously<br/>
&gt;i&#39;m making mistakes, i just don&#39;t understand what they are or what to<br/>
&gt;do instead.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is all about you, your feelings, your wants, and is teaching them <br/>
nothing except that the biggest person gets to make the calls, the <br/>
feelings of the biggest person are the only feelings that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been that biggest person. Please stop now. The longer you live like <br/>
this the worse it gets. I nearly lost my eldest son because of this sort <br/>
of behaviour, I&#39;m so glad that he has been a big enough person to give <br/>
me a second chance. Stop thinking about your own feelings, start really <br/>
getting in there and being with your kids, listening to them, giving to <br/>
them. I know you love them - but they only know they are loved if people <br/>
show it in very real ways.  When you constantly treat them as faulty <br/>
beings that need to be made to become better people, they don&#39;t feel <br/>
loved, they don&#39;t feel good about themselves. I was one of those <br/>
not-good-enough children and I&#39;m still battling, raging, though slowly <br/>
learning to believe in myself. My eldest son, especially was one of <br/>
those kids too. I&#39;ve changed and grown and got heaps better over the <br/>
years. I&#39;m not critcising because I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m saying this <br/>
because I DO understand only too well.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work. Honestly.<br/>

&gt; That page has a great little bit by Joyce Fetteroll about saying yes  <br/>
&gt; instead of no.  Instead of &quot;Don&#39;t throw things in the house&quot; you  <br/>
&gt; could say &quot;Let&#39;s go to the park and throw things!&quot;    Boys NEED to  <br/>
&gt; throw things.  Boys&#39; mothers need to help them find safe places and  <br/>
&gt; good things to throw.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-. All these types of rules<br/>
&gt; have valid reasons behind them, that i do explain to my children over<br/>
&gt; and over again.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re saying something over and over again, you must have said it  <br/>
&gt; wrong the third or fourth time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- It seems that just understanding why i tell them<br/>
&gt; something isn&#39;t enough for them.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What makes you think they understand what you mean?<br/>
&gt; Or do you mean they understand why you tell them what to do so much?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-They will still run through the house<br/>
&gt; hurt themselves on furniture and then come screaming to me about it,<br/>
&gt; and worst of all, they will yell blame at the furniture for hurting<br/>
&gt; them, when THEY ran into It. I will say &quot;It&#39;s not the dresser&#39;s fault<br/>
&gt; you got hurt. The dresser didn&#39;t move, you ran into it because you<br/>
&gt; were runing in the house and not paying attention to what you were<br/>
&gt; doing and what is around you&quot;.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if you sympathized and held the child and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry you  <br/>
&gt; got hurt.  Here...&quot; and helped him the same way you would help an  <br/>
&gt; adult guest who might have gotten hurt at your house?  Ice pack, or  <br/>
&gt; bandage, or soft place to sit, and sympathy?  Then when he&#39;s calm and  <br/>
&gt; feeling loved, and you&#39;re calm you *MIGHT* add &quot;That&#39;s why we ask you  <br/>
&gt; not to run in the house.&quot;   But you probably wouldn&#39;t have to add any  <br/>
&gt; such thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You add insult to injury, literally, by shaming him and telling him  <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s his fault, as though you&#39;re glad he got hurt, and he deserved it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-My children break their things on purpose, hit and yell at each  <br/>
&gt; other,<br/>
&gt; call names, throw tantrums, refuse to do what i ask them. They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; listen well and i have to say everything several times, just to get<br/>
&gt; their attention. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what it seems like to me:<br/>
&gt; They need better attention.  They need LOTS of it.  They  need not to  <br/>
&gt; be left alone so much, but to be with you and their dad more, either  <br/>
&gt; all together or one-on-one in varying combinations.  They need to be  <br/>
&gt; spoken to the way you would speak to a friend, an adult, a stranger,  <br/>
&gt; a guest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re not listening well.  They&#39;re trying to get your attention, but  <br/>
&gt; you just keep droning on with the same messages, instead of REALLY  <br/>
&gt; listening to what they need, and being their partners in life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-We take care of our belongings. We don&#39;t hit and<br/>
&gt; scream at each other. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But you hit and scream at the boys and they&#39;re hitting and screaming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I will admit that we both lose our tempers eventually and yell at  <br/>
&gt; the boys,<br/>
&gt; but never name calling, insults or cutdowns. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you were a guest in someone&#39;s home and he started yelling at you,  <br/>
&gt; would it really matter exactly what the words were?  The intent and  <br/>
&gt; emotion would be clear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-And they aren&#39;t paying us any attention at all before we get to  <br/>
&gt; the point of yelling. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon they might not be paying attention even when you are yelling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I try to be responsible for my own actions and not blame others when<br/>
&gt; things don&#39;t go right for me. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even when it involves your children?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I try to respect other people and their<br/>
&gt; space, but my children don&#39;t seem to pick any of it up. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You need to respect THEM, your children, and THEIR space.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-When we accidently make mistakes<br/>
&gt; against other people we apologize immediately.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you apologize to them after you ground them or yell at them or  <br/>
&gt; spank them?<br/>
&gt; Or do you (I&#39;m guessing from the way I was treated, and others have  <br/>
&gt; been treated) blame them and say you wouldn&#39;t have yelled, but it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; their fault?  You didn&#39;t want to spank them, but you had no choice?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-&quot;Okay, well this really upsets me, i don&#39;t buy you things just so you<br/>
&gt; can break them, you need to learn to think before you do things, do<br/>
&gt; you want to just not have things, cause when you break your stuff you<br/>
&gt; just won&#39;t have any stuff, you&#39;re grounded.&quot; Then he proceeds to throw<br/>
&gt; a tantrum because i told him he was grounded from his playstation for<br/>
&gt; the rest of the day-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on his side.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you buy them magnifying glasses (they broke one and still had  <br/>
&gt; one, so your frustration wasn&#39;t about them not being able to look at  <br/>
&gt; bugs, really) so they could go and do something and leave you alone?   <br/>
&gt; You didn&#39;t write about going to look at bugs with them.  And it took  <br/>
&gt; you two weeks to know it was broken, so you also probably didn&#39;t ask  <br/>
&gt; how it went, or help them find a good place to keep their new stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your goal in life is to train your kids to do what you say, it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; not working out very well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your goal is going to be creating a homelife in which they can  <br/>
&gt; feel safe and learn from everything around them, then &quot;grounding him  <br/>
&gt; from his playstation&quot; isn&#39;t helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your goal is to have a good relationship with your children, and  <br/>
&gt; you maintain your defense of the adversarial life you&#39;ve set up, it  <br/>
&gt; will go from the bad it is now to worse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can go<br/>
&gt; in his room and do it or get in time out.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You send them away from you a lot.   Lots.  I think they need their  <br/>
&gt; mom, and a nice mom, who&#39;s sympathetic and cares more about them than  <br/>
&gt; about plastic magnifying glasses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff, i explain how<br/>
&gt; it makes me feel,-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You care WAY more about how it makes you feel than how you&#39;re making  <br/>
&gt; him feel.  That might be the crux of the problem.  It&#39;s about you.   <br/>
&gt; YOU want them to do this or that because of the way it makes you  <br/>
&gt; feel.  Your threats are cruel.  You&#39;ve made them small and  <br/>
&gt; powerless.  You can&#39;t perfect anything overnight, but you can abandon  <br/>
&gt; cruelty in a heartbeat if you want to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- i listen to his feelings of not wanting to be<br/>
&gt; punished, but then tell him i understand his feelings, and that<br/>
&gt; through different actions he could have avoided that consequence.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It wasn&#39;t a &quot;consequence,&quot; it was your chosen punishment.  You&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; making lots of choices and blaming your children for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People here can help!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are some other things to read.  Please, do click on the links  <br/>
&gt; above and read them.  If you had met some of the kids talked about  <br/>
&gt; there, you would read it avidly.  Children and parents can have a  <br/>
&gt; really sweet relationship, a gentle relationship, and it doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll be running and screaming and breaking things.  It can be better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are completely misunderstanding me. I didn&#39;t say that i<br/>
don&#39;t comfort my children when they get hurt. Of course i do, but then<br/>
i also explain why it happened. Is it okay to let a child blame the<br/>
dresser that they got injured when you are trying to teach them self<br/>
responsibility? Or do you explain to them why it really happened?<br/>
Also, i think a seven year old boy is quite old enough to put a chip<br/>
bag in the trash instead of throwing it on the floor. I see two year<br/>
olds that can throw away trash. I&#39;m with my children almost all the<br/>
time. I don&#39;t think you know enough about me to say that i&#39;m not with<br/>
my children enough. I stay home, have a small home, and rarely have<br/>
even family babysit for me. I don&#39;t tell my children to go in their<br/>
room and scream because i don&#39;t want to listen to what they are<br/>
saying. It&#39;s that they become unreasonable to the point that i can&#39;t<br/>
even try explaining the situation to them over the yelling, and they<br/>
won&#39;t stop yelling to listen. Nerf balls and paper airplanes are<br/>
great, if that&#39;s what they decide to throw, but they throw whatever<br/>
they choose to. Books specifically really upset me, and i have tried<br/>
to explain to them how valuable books are. I think it&#39;s a bit harsh to<br/>
talk about having cruelty in my heart when i came here for advice. I<br/>
suppose i should just let my children scream, run, hit each other, and<br/>
break things and shouldn&#39;t punish them at all, and they will suddenly<br/>
learn to respect me, and they will stop running, screaming and hitting<br/>
and listen to me trying to explain things to them about how life<br/>
works. By the way, no, i don&#39;t blame the children, i think i already<br/>
stated that i realize i&#39;m the one making the mistakes.</div>

using the magnifying glass in a way in which it was not intended,<br/>

money well spent.<br/>
<br/>
Also, asking a kid why they do things generally won&#39;t yield any<br/>
insightful information.  When I was asked &quot;why&quot; when I was a kid, it<br/>

glassicide?  Your sons naturally learned that doing whatever it was<br/>
they were doing with the magnifying glass causes magnifying glasses to<br/>
break.  But, the lesson is probably lost on them &#39;cause they&#39;re<br/>
smarting over the shame they felt by hurting your feelings. <br/>

other feelings he might have had about the magnifying glass.<br/>

purpose&quot;?  That&#39;s really pouring salt into the wound.  Maybe he was<br/>
sad that glass broke.  But you made this all about you and his willful<br/>
disregard for you and your efforts.  Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It goes on and on until i&#39;m telling him to get in time out because<br/>

so demeaning!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t see how i&#39;m handling this situation<br/>
&gt; incorrectly. I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you ever break stuff?  Can you recall how you felt about it?  You<br/>
may have been blaming yourself for it and thinking &quot;If only I hadn&#39;t<br/>
been so careless&quot; or something like that.  Well, now imagine someone<br/>
shaming you for something you already feel badly about.  How is that<br/>
helpful?  Wouldn&#39;t a little sympathy be much more effective in this<br/>
case and wouldn&#39;t you feel a surge of love and gratitude to the person<br/>
who was being sympathetic?  I know I would.<br/>
<br/>
I was brought up in a very authoritarian house when I was a kid, and<br/>
the big thing was that because of that my folks didn&#39;t trust me and I<br/>
didn&#39;t trust them.   They actually covertly discouraged me from<br/>
telling the truth because I knew that the consequences of doing so<br/>
were unacceptable to me.  But, when they asked me why I lied, I told<br/>
them &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  And I didn&#39;t.   But, now I do.<br/>
<br/>
I will not repeat that cycle with my son.  He&#39;s not afraid to tell me<br/>
the truth, and this stands us in very good stead, I think, for his<br/>
impending teenage years.  I know we trust each other, and I know we<br/>
respect each other, and I know that he can tell me stuff that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have dreamed of telling my folks. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s post was really good, and she pointed out a lot of things<br/>
that I think will be helpful to you, if you can allow yourself a<br/>
moment of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
I surely hope all this stuff helps!!<br/>

wear eye protection (swimming goggles), and pick up the bits and throw <br/>

&quot;smashy smashy&quot; thing...<br/>
<br/>
  We have no yard at our house, but we do have huge balcony/patio spaces<br/>
that wrap most of the way around the house, both upstairs and down.<br/>
Downstairs, we have a sandbox...with purple sand.  (Purple was all they had<br/>
at the PX when we got the sandbox, so purple is what we have...it looks nice<br/>
sprinkled on the brown carpet. :) )  Adam, (3) plays out there for hours<br/>
with the sand, the hose, and whatever else he can find.  He usually takes<br/>
the lid off the sandbox and shovels sand into it and then adds water and<br/>
leaves, and twigs... We&#39;ve asked him to keep the water out of the main part<br/>
of the sandbox as drying it out would be difficult because of ever present<br/>
rain and wind.  He has always been happy to oblige...until today.<br/>
<br/>
  Today, I went outside to find the sandbox full of water (a few inches of<br/>
purple sand remained in the bottom) and two happy boys-- Adam and his baby<br/>
brother, Jomy (16 mos) doing &quot;cannonballs&quot; into the sandbox  from the<br/>
lid...&quot;Look Mama!  We have a beach!&quot;  And so they did!  Jomy was thrilled<br/>
with the feel of the wet sand between his toes, and sat in the &quot;beachy&quot;<br/>
water playing happily while Adam splashed him with his cannonballs.  I don&#39;t<br/>
guess we&#39;ll be able to dry out the sand, but will spread it around the patio<br/>
wet and sweep it into the overgrown lot next door as it dries...that which<br/>
doesn&#39;t blow away first.  I guess this summer we&#39;ll have a &quot;water box&quot; to<br/>
play in until we leave in July or August.  No sense in replacing the sand if<br/>
they&#39;d rather have water.  If they want sand, maybe the PX will have blue<br/>
this year!<br/>
<br/>
  Since we do live on an island, I guess any beach is a good beach.<br/>

ref=sr_1_1/002-5649649-0528030?s=books&v=glance&n=283155<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very easy read. Lots of different approaches.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Tami said deserves repeating:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we&#39;re telling you how your kids see you and your behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing that book helped me to see was that my daughter was  <br/>
behaving according to *her* perception of the world, and her  <br/>
perception -- since she&#39;s a different person -- was just as valid as  <br/>
mine. If I reacted to her according to my perception of the world she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to understand. I needed to understand why she was  <br/>
behaving as she was. What it was her behavior was telling me she  <br/>
needed. And to *trust* that her needs were valid.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it was &quot;right&quot; for her to leave all the toys out all  <br/>
the time. It&#39;s not that I was &quot;right&quot; to want them put away. It&#39;s  <br/>
just that we had different goal and different needs. The way to  <br/>
approach two humans who have conflicting wants and needs isn&#39;t for  <br/>
the big person to make the little person do what the big person  <br/>
thinks is &quot;sensible&quot;. (Nor even to wear the little person down by  <br/>
explaining why the big person is right and the little person is wrong!)<br/>
<br/>
*Trust* that your children don&#39;t want to get hurt. It&#39;s not something  <br/>
you need to teach them! But sometimes running (or whatever) is a  <br/>
greater overriding want. Help them. Be their partner in getting what  <br/>
they want. When they know that you&#39;re on their side, when they know  <br/>
that you&#39;re there to help them get what *they* want, then they&#39;ll  <br/>
listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you&#39;re giving them what you think they should want, eg,  <br/>
freedom from pain for instance. But to get them to hear what you&#39;re  <br/>
saying you need to listen to what they&#39;re trying to tell you. And  <br/>
help them get that.<br/>
<br/>
There *isn&#39;t* just one path to a goal. If they&#39;re running in the  <br/>
house breaking things, the answer isn&#39;t to let them. The answer is to  <br/>
realize they need to run and get them out of the house. Is it always  <br/>
possible to get them out of the house? No. But the more you set aside  <br/>
what you&#39;re doing to make it possible, the more you put your  <br/>
children&#39;s needs above other needs, the more they&#39;ll come to trust  <br/>
that you really are working to help them.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids trust that you will get them out of the house to help  <br/>
them run -- trust built up from lots of experience with you following  <br/>
through and rarely backing out (and apologizing when you do) -- then  <br/>
it will be less difficult for them to stop running for a while than  <br/>
when they hear &quot;Don&#39;t run or you&#39;ll get hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean always set aside other things. This isn&#39;t about  <br/>
rules. It&#39;s about principles. It&#39;s about helping kids trust that your  <br/>
goal is to help them.<br/>
<br/>
The more we show that we&#39;re trying to help them get what they want,  <br/>
the more they&#39;ll trust us and the more they&#39;ll accept the times when  <br/>
we can&#39;t right away.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also not about becoming a slave to your kids and a nonentitiy  <br/>
with no wants and needs of your own. It&#39;s about *wanting* to be their  <br/>
partner. It&#39;s about putting them a first priority and working the  <br/>
rest of life around them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* easy to see housework, cooking, shopping as things that  <br/>
need done and children&#39;s needs as something that we can set aside for  <br/>
after. We can say our children&#39;s needs are our first priority but if  <br/>
we *act* as if they aren&#39;t, if we are often saying &quot;I have to do this  <br/>
thing before I help you&quot; then that says to the kids-- even if we  <br/>
don&#39;t intend it to -- that our &quot;thing&quot; is more important than they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t say that i<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t comfort my children when they get hurt. Of course i do, but then<br/>
&gt; i also explain why it happened.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A long time ago, I wanted to back into the drive so I pulled over to  <br/>
the side of the road to let the cars behind me pass. Unfortunately  <br/>
the side of the road had a sharp granite curb sticking out from an  <br/>
asphalt curb and I slashed the tire.<br/>
<br/>
I went in and told my husband and he went out and checked out the  <br/>
tire and said we&#39;d have to go get a new one. I thought, &quot;Wow, what a  <br/>
great way to react to my very embarrassing and stupid mistake!&quot; He  <br/>
concentrated on the problem and how to solve it. Cool!<br/>
<br/>
But then he said &quot;You should be more careful next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that just erased all the good he&#39;d built up. What it said was  <br/>
that he didn&#39;t trust me to learn from experience. He had to *tell* me  <br/>
what I should learn.<br/>
<br/>
(That incident stands out because he rarely tells me what I should  <br/>
have learned!)<br/>
<br/>
Trust your kids. Trust that they can learn from life. Do give them  <br/>
information. (If you were about to cut off your hand with a table saw  <br/>
you&#39;d *want* someone to stop you!) But trust that -- even when they  <br/>
aren&#39;t making the choices you would -- that they&#39;re intelligent  <br/>
beings. If they&#39;re making different choices than you think are  <br/>
&quot;sensible&quot; then there&#39;s something they want that&#39;s worth the  <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we should be giving our kids information so they can make  <br/>
choices that move them towards what they want. But if we&#39;ve given  <br/>
them the information and they&#39;re still doing something that seems  <br/>
wrong to you, then either 1) they aren&#39;t ready to understand or 2)  <br/>
they want something else that overrides the information.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like they need to run more than they need to avoid getting  <br/>
hurt. The answer isn&#39;t to tell them how not to get hurt but to give  <br/>
them more opportunities to run, and accept the fact that when they&#39;re  <br/>
running in the house that running is more important to them at the  <br/>
moment and that it&#39;s worth it to them that they might get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Life is about recognizing the consequences of our choices and  <br/>
choosing to put up with some consequences to get something better.<br/>

and stops it from hurting so much. Linnaea (6) knows the dresser didn&#39;t <br/>
really jump out and bump her, but since it is an inanimate object it <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt it to be yelled at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or do you explain to them why it really happened?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They know why, they were there, they saw what happened. I tend to just <br/>
sweep them in my arms and cuddle them. If it is an interpersonal <br/>
conflict, as opposed to them against the dresser I offer to help, I try <br/>
distractions, I try compromise. Sometimes it is because they&#39;re hungry <br/>
or tired, and so I offer food and maybe a movie or something to relax <br/>
against. Sometimes it is because beating the starship fleet on the <br/>
gamecube is so frustratingly impossible that it just makes the rest of <br/>
the world dark and wrong. So, I read from the book (if we have a prima <br/>
guide)  or look up hints and cheats on the internet or I just offer to <br/>
help the one who isn&#39;t frustrated, usually Linnaea as she likes games <br/>
she has greater competence in than does Simon (9 tomorrow!!), find <br/>
something else to do, something that isn&#39;t right there watching Simon <br/>
grow so frustrated that he just can&#39;t do what he wants to do that he <br/>
lashes out at her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, i think a seven year old boy is quite old enough to put a chip<br/>

&gt; olds that can throw away trash. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not always old enough at 38 to make sure that all the chips go in <br/>
the trash or my mouth. Sometimes they end up on my shirt front or on the <br/>
floor around me &#39;cause I&#39;m just not paying attention. Sometimes David <br/>
picks them up for me. He does that a lot when I cook, I&#39;m not a very <br/>
tidy cook. More often I pick up the chips, or the bags they came in. <br/>
Simon and Linnaea have a favorite seat in the house. It&#39;s on the back of <br/>
the sofa nearest the television next to the radiator. It&#39;s warm and cozy <br/>
and the center of visual entertainment. They tend to eat there. So, <br/>
behind the sofa it is often a bit crumby and gross. Knowing that, <br/>
knowing that it wasn&#39;t conscious on their part, it is standard operating <br/>
procedure to move the couch whenever we clean and vacuum behind it. If I <br/>
see them throw a bag on the floor I&#39;ll ask if they could take it to the <br/>
trash, or say &quot;empty packets go in the trash&quot; or something like that. Or <br/>
I might just pick it up and put it in the trash. It depends on if I was <br/>
moving in the first place, it depends on what they were doing as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t tell my children to go in their<br/>
&gt; room and scream because i don&#39;t want to listen to what they are<br/>
&gt; saying. It&#39;s that they become unreasonable to the point that i can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even try explaining the situation to them over the yelling, and they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t stop yelling to listen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe if you helped them get through that moment, just be there, or walk <br/>
away from them, or whatever needs to happen in that moment and then talk <br/>
about it later. If David (dh) snaps at me at a bad moment, says I told <br/>
you so or talks about how I could have done something better while I&#39;m <br/>
still coping with the badness that happened, I&#39;m really far more likely <br/>
to snap at him then listen. It is very easy for me to turn my <br/>
frustration in that moment outward. If, however, we talk about it later, <br/>
talk about what might have worked after I&#39;ve relaxed about it, I&#39;m far <br/>
more receptive. I&#39;ve found that with Simon and Linnaea waiting for a <br/>
better moment to talk about ways to deal with whatever happened helps a <br/>
lot, just like it does with me. Simon is the more sensitive of the two <br/>
of them, the more likely to be upset by what he sees as his own personal <br/>
failings. If I can offer him tools for getting through a situation, ways <br/>
of repairing a mistake he made, like when he deleted Linnaea&#39;s Mario <br/>
dancemat memory from the memory card, it helps him to see a way out. <br/>
Otherwise it feels, for him, like he cannot ever recover from such a <br/>
horrible thing. If I put him in a time out until he calmed down enough, <br/>
it would be adding insult to injury. I have suggested to him that he <br/>
might want to calm down, go upstairs for a little bit, remove himself <br/>
from what is making him so upset. I&#39;ve done the same with Linnaea, but <br/>
for her separation from people is far more punitive than it is for <br/>
Simon. So, it isn&#39;t always a helpful course of action. I write this as <br/>
though these moments are calm moments which is false. These are moments <br/>
of intense unhappiness, I hate discord between the two of them. I hate <br/>
discord between the four of us for that matter. And when it happens, I <br/>
am ever so actively looking for solutions. Sometimes, the hardest thing <br/>
for me, the best thing to do is let whoever is hurting come to a point <br/>
where they are ready to be helped. And that may just mean giving them <br/>
space. Not forcing them to take it, but getting Simon or Linnaea to move <br/>
with me somewhere else so that the hurt person can lick their wounds and <br/>
decide when they want to reach out again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nerf balls and paper airplanes are<br/>
&gt; great, if that&#39;s what they decide to throw, but they throw whatever<br/>
&gt; they choose to. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then get a good book of how to make paper airplanes, or look on-line for <br/>
planes, and whenever they start to throw something that you don&#39;t like <br/>
make a plane. Put a nerf ball in their hands. Make parachutes and drop <br/>
them out of the windows with them, or down from the banister. Distract <br/>
them with the appropriate toy and use that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Books specifically really upset me, and i have tried<br/>
&gt; to explain to them how valuable books are. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Books aren&#39;t inherently valuable. And are relatively easy to replace. <br/>
But, getting hit upside the head by the corner of a hardback edition of <br/>
anything hurts. Books may be valuable to you, but maybe other things are <br/>
more valuable to them. Books aren&#39;t that valuable to me unless they <br/>
contain something I want from them. I have a couple of books that were <br/>
my grandmother&#39;s that I am quite fond of, so I don&#39;t put them in <br/>
accessible places. But otherwise, while I enjoy books, I don&#39;t hold them <br/>
in higher esteem than I do my good relationship with my children .<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose i should just let my children scream, run, hit each other, and<br/>
&gt; break things and shouldn&#39;t punish them at all, and they will suddenly<br/>
&gt; learn to respect me, and they will stop running, screaming and hitting<br/>
&gt; and listen to me trying to explain things to them about how life<br/>
&gt; works. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could. But it wouldn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t let Simon and Linnaea hit each <br/>
other and break things. I don&#39;t punish them. I let them scream and run. <br/>
If it drives me nuts in the house I&#39;ll often offer them other places to <br/>
run and scream. If they are hitting each other, I help them to find <br/>
other ways to communicate their needs. If they break something, as <br/>
Linnaea just did with our Olympus camera (damn, damn, damn) I spend a <br/>
good deal of time trying to fix it, I try and help David be calm, as he <br/>
is very sensitive to things getting broken, and we learn to live without <br/>
the broken thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By the way, no, i don&#39;t blame the children, i think i already<br/>
&gt; stated that i realize i&#39;m the one making the mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And we are just trying to help you find a different way forward.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784089290">Yeah, that&#39;s true, if something doesn&#39;t make causal sense, like why did <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839216921">Hello Everyone, <br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and am just catching up on posts.  I have found all the responses to be very interesting....<br/>
Along the lines of trying to put yourself in your children&#39;s shoes/minds/bodies I have learned that my children have sensory integration issues ( see &quot;the out of sinc child&quot;), and food allergies .<br/>
Understanding what is going on for them physiologically has been a tremendous help . Maybe your kids are looking for sensory feedback and need to do it so much because their bodies just don&#39;t process it in the way some others do. Maybe they&#39;re seemingly destructive/unco-operative behavior comes from a reaction to a substance in food....&#39;poison&quot; can make you behave in pretty wild ways!  I can attest to the dramatic difference that it can make. I have 2 children (3 &6) on the mild end of the autism spectrum , questioning why/what could be going on for you/ being a detective on their behalf sometimes and always striving to come from a place of respect and sovereignty will help you all. Feel free to ask more if any of this resonates with you....<br/>
