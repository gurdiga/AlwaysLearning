<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327304484">We had such a wonderful day today.  So tired of all the bad weather and rain <br/>
all day today.  We decided to go for a walk in the rain on our property so we <br/>
dressed up and headed out the door.  Splashed in many puddles, walked through <br/>
the forest looking at the trees that had fallen with the last storm. Walked <br/>
by the creeks looking at the deer tracks.  Picked up mines (golf balls hit <br/>
out there by dad). Stopped and hit the mines back down in the field. Looked <br/>
at everything and decided that we should go walking in the rain more often.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like so much fun, Pam.  We&#39;ve been having great spring-like weather<br/>
here lately.  Really, truly, amazingly nice.  Last year at this time, it was<br/>
raining every day and we were inches deep in mud.  So I&#39;m doubly grateful<br/>
every time the sun comes out in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my son has been fighting a stomache bug, so going outside to<br/>
play was out.  But we had a great day, too.  Tim still had some fever, but<br/>
was feeling so much better today.<br/>
<br/>
We sorted all of Tim&#39;s coins into the boxes that you sent (thanks!),<br/>
labelled the sections, and made a list of all the countries he has<br/>
represented (88, in the final count!!!).  And we spent hours sitting in the<br/>
sunny living room paging through coin books trying to identify three elusive<br/>
coins without obvious country names on them (Morocco, Tunisia, and Croatia).<br/>
<br/>
We took breaks to watch all the videos he&#39;s almost outgrown and hasn&#39;t seen<br/>
in ages.  I haven&#39;t had this much fun with a sick child, ever!<br/>
