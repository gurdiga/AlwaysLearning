<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981795530">This is from a friend who&#39;s a forestry agent; timely info right now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Here is a great website that homeowners need to know about - especially<br/>
with the heightened awareness of the wildfires burning in the wildland/urban<br/>
interface areas.     It is sponsored by the US Forest Service, BLM, BIA,<br/>
NPS, US Fish & Wildlife Service, State Forestry Associations, and National<br/>
Fire Protection Agency - all the groups most involved in wildland<br/>
firefighting.<br/>
<br/>
It is a great interactive website - with some very good information.<br/>
Seasonal peak of fires in your region, tips on making your home safer and<br/>
more defensible from wildfires, what to do in case of approaching wildfire,<br/>
&quot;firewise&quot; landscaping, an interactive quiz to raise your awareness and many<br/>
other items.<br/>
<br/>
