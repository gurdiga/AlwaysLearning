<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183276062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? Your kids do not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>need you to help them sleep and you being there probably actually <br/>
keeps them from sleeping well.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that some children do need help to sleep.  I know we have a <br/>
cosleeping arrangement.  My boys would find it difficult alone as would I.  When we <br/>
are together we sleep peacefully.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It is not against the unschooling train of thought to insist that your <br/>
 </span></blockquote>children be in their rooms by a certain time each night.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Not sure about the &quot;unschooling train of thought&quot; but I never insist on <br/>
anything.  My mother was like that.  It was &quot;because I said so&quot;.  We never had any <br/>
dialogue, my thoughts and feelings were not respected.  That is something I <br/>
want for my children.  I  respect their thoughts and opinions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; We remind him about 7 everynight that it is about time for bed, he knows <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the routine that he needs to get his pjs on and clean up whatever he&#39;s working <br/>
on (he doesn&#39;t have to put away stuff he wants to work on the next day but he <br/>
can&#39;t have toys everywhere) then he picks out a story for me himself and dad, <br/>
goes potty, brushes teeth etc. If he is not ready by 7:30 then no stories and <br/>
he has to put himself to bed and we do only hugs and kisses,&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
In our house we don&#39;t withhold things to &quot;get someone to do what we want&quot;.  <br/>
Punishment isn&#39;t our way.  I would rather that my children get ready for bed <br/>
because they are tired. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I can see how your dh <br/>
 </span></blockquote>could easily be stressed by the situation - I think I would be <br/>
also!!! Why not have a family meeting and come to a good agreement <br/>
on a bedtime, a time for the children to remain in their rooms and <br/>
get ready for sleep in their own way.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
A family meeting is only good if everyone has equal say and everyone&#39;s voice <br/>
is respected and there is a win-win situation. Where everyone&#39;s needs are at <br/>
least partially met. Sometimes a family meeting can lead to &quot;this is the way we <br/>
are doing things&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Perhaps letting them understand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you could give them now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger <br/>
relationship between you and your dh. Remember that freedom is no <br/>
longer freedom when it infringes on the rights of others. Good luck! &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
and perhaps not.  It doesn&#39;t take a bedtime and adult alone time every night <br/>
at 7:30 to build a strong relationship.  We have always attachment parented <br/>
and coslept. (Was it Heidi in the original post)  It sounds like you have worked <br/>
out a good compromise that is working for everyone.  You get your sleep and <br/>
the children and dad get theirs.  Conversation time with dad can happen <br/>
anytime.  The children don&#39;t have to be asleep for that.  I know that my boys often <br/>
play int eh living room while we are eating dinner.  Or will be watching a TV <br/>
show in another room etc.  And &quot;private&quot; time with your dh can also happen <br/>
anywhere.  Sometimes when you do cosleep I think you have to be more flexible.  <br/>
But I do agree with you.  I feel I brought these children into the world it is <br/>
my responsibility to meet their needs.  Right now they need to security and <br/>
comfort of sleeping with me.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137134126">I think that one thing to remember too is that not all kids do fall<br/>
asleep easily<br/>
on their own. With my oldest, now 7, we have gone through SO many<br/>
different types<br/>
of sleep...and only now is he comfortable with falling asleep by<br/>
himself. He was <br/>
*able* to do it, if he had to, but he did not like too and I did not see<br/>
any<br/>
reason to force the issue. The funny thing is, that it was not until I<br/>
gave up<br/>
trying to get him to bed at a certain time that I was able to find what<br/>
would<br/>
work well for us. <br/>
<br/>
When I first &quot;gave up bedtimes&quot;, he would stay up until I<br/>
was ready for bed, sometimes around 12 or 1. But then he was exhausted<br/>
the next<br/>
day. What I found after a little while of this was that he seemed to<br/>
honestly<br/>
get tired around 10 pm, but his desire to stay up with me caused him to<br/>
stay<br/>
awake as long as he could. So I just gradually adjusted our nighttime<br/>
routine.<br/>
Instead of reading for a little while at 8 and then letting him stay up<br/>
until<br/>
he was tired, I now read to both boys starting around 8:30ish, Kyle<br/>
usually <br/>
crashes around 9 and Jason and I keep reading until around 10ish. We<br/>
then<br/>
go upstairs and I lie down with him a bit (and we have some of the best <br/>
conversations! Last night we talked all about the solstices and<br/>
equinoxes) and<br/>
now he is perfectly fine with me going downstairs (in the past anytime I<br/>
tried<br/>
to leave before he was asleep, he would be up and after me within<br/>
minutes).<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we tried so long to get him onto a schedule..sometimes<br/>
with <br/>
success, but for the most part not. For us it was not for lack of<br/>
trying!<br/>
He just tends to be a very high energy kid who does not tire easily. He <br/>
also has a very strong need to be with people. It has only been in the<br/>
last<br/>
year that I have truly begun to see this as how he is and begun to be<br/>
able<br/>
to accept it. Luckily we discovered the family bed when he was 1 and we<br/>
worked on all sorts of gentle ways to help him sleep..relaxation<br/>
exercises,<br/>
lavender on his pillow etc. But underlying it was that we were trying to<br/>
<br/>
change him...now I feel more like we are accepting him and his sleep<br/>
needs<br/>
and trying to work out something that works for everyone. I do wake<br/>
everyone at around 8am, but we cuddle on the couch together watching<br/>
dora <br/>
or save-ums while we wake up. Actually a very nice way to wake up. <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, Kyle (almost 4), who was nursed to sleep and shared a<br/>
bed with us from<br/>
day 1 has always fallen asleep between 8 and 9. He used to tell me when<br/>
he<br/>
needed a nap also. Kyle&#39;s sleep from day one was very unstructured...he<br/>
slept<br/>
when he was sleepy in a sling and we did little to no scheduling.<br/>
Different kids,<br/>
different needs. Sometimes I am glad that we had Jason first, as we<br/>
might never have<br/>
discovered the joys of co-sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
DH has not always been overly happy with our sleep arrangements...we<br/>
have had to<br/>
be very creative sometimes to get time together. I kept telling him that<br/>
it would<br/>
not last forever and it seems like we have finally hit that time...we<br/>
have a couple<br/>
of hours each evening and have just now started going away overnight<br/>
(the kids<br/>
adore my ILs). Kyle has just now started sleeping with his brother,<br/>
before that<br/>
he would fall asleep in the living room and I would move him into bed<br/>
with us<br/>
when I went to sleep...leaving the bedroom free for when we needed it.<br/>
;o)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck Heidi! Just keep trying to think of ways to work so that<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
are met. They may not be met today, but if you keep thinking about it<br/>
you may <br/>
surprise yourself and come up with some creative solutions. <br/>
