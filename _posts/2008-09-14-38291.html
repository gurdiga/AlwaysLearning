<div id="ygrps-yiv-91208761">I am new to homeschooling and I am currently using a curriculum <br/>
(k12), mostly because I am still in the &quot;I have to do something that <br/>
other people will recognize as schooling or they will think I am not <br/>
educating my child&quot; panic. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, with that said.  I really am interested in how to approach number <br/>
concepts without &#39;seat work&#39;.  I just finished reading an <br/>
article/blog entry on doing so, but...the person writing the entry <br/>
LOVES math. In fact, she does trig for fun and referred to algebra as <br/>
mind candy.  Math is not my thing.  I am not very good at it and <br/>
really never have been; Which is part of the reason I took my <br/>
daughter out of public schools. (They had placed her in a low reading <br/>
group and she began to dislike reading. It reminded me way to much of <br/>
my math issues.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that my mindset has to change and that will take some time. <br/>
In the meantime does anyone have suggestions for math games or <br/>
activities?  My daughter really likes math and likes the worksheets <br/>
she has.  Maybe playing learning games together would help me to feel <br/>
I am doing something quantifiable to expose her to number concepts <br/>
but still not be working with ridged school room methods. <br/>

<br/>
I would recommend, first, stop thinking of the world in terms of  <br/>
things like &quot;number concepts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the real school-free world, there are needs to do things like  <br/>
measuring, comparing, weighing, cutting, stacking, splitting,  <br/>
digging, planting, mowing, vacuuming, folding, grouping.... and  <br/>
that&#39;s without even starting on the things that have numbers printed  <br/>
right on them, or playing cards or video games.<br/>
<br/>
Let your worries go.  They will hinder your children&#39;s learning (and  <br/>
your learning).<br/>

Find the game &quot;Zoombinis.&quot;  You can probably find it used or cheap.   <br/>
&quot;The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis.&quot;  Play that with your  <br/>
daughter, or without her.  Just play it and try not to be  <br/>
analytical.  After you&#39;ve played the heck out of it for a week or so,  <br/>
THEN look back at what you were doing.<br/>

And for me, being math-wounded, it spooks me even to see the phrase  <br/>
&quot;college math instructor.&quot;  But I was able to find ways not to pass  <br/>
that on to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I can do math when it&#39;s in English. It&#39;s not the normal everyday math  <br/>
that scares me.  I sew without patterns and make things all the time  <br/>
that involve what would be geometry if it were written out.  It&#39;s  <br/>
math notation that turns my insides to jelly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there are musicians who don&#39;t read music, and musicians who do  <br/>
read music but who care little or nothing about the physics of  <br/>
sound.   It&#39;s okay.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really am interested in how to approach number<br/>
&gt; concepts without &#39;seat work&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First by recognizing that schools don&#39;t stress number concepts. They  <br/>
teach notation and formulas. They *hope* kids pick up how numbers  <br/>
work and how to manipulate number information by going through the  <br/>
drill of notation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want to teach concepts, but it&#39;s really hard  <br/>
to test whether kids understand concepts. So they teach what can be  <br/>
tested and hope some how the kids grasp the concepts. (From the  <br/>
number of people who end up mathphobic, schools are doing more damage  <br/>
than good. The kids who grasp math, do it in spite of instruction  <br/>
rather than because of it :-/ )<br/>
<br/>
Teaching the notation for concepts kids don&#39;t understand is *really*  <br/>
hard. That&#39;s why it takes so much time and so much practice. It&#39;s  <br/>
like teaching kids to write before they understand what language is.  <br/>
And a negative consequence is that kids can shut down when they see  <br/>
real world uses of the concepts that might help them grasp the  <br/>
concepts, like freezing up with they see 20% free.<br/>
<br/>
Real understanding of numbers comes from using them for personally  <br/>
meaningful reasons. And it takes very little time. Minutes per week  <br/>
rather than hours. Allowance. Video games. Cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Talk out loud when you&#39;re solving a problem, like when they ask, &quot;How  <br/>
long until Daddy gets home?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#39;s 11 now, and he gets home at  <br/>
6, so&quot; holding up your fingers as you count out the hours &quot;11, 12, 1,  <br/>
2, 3, 4, 5, 6&quot; so 8 hours. This is *not* a lesson. You&#39;re not doing  <br/>
this for them, just talking out your thought process out loud. Don&#39;t  <br/>
feel that they need to see you do this. It&#39;s just helpful to have it  <br/>
swirling around in the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Learn how to manipulate numbers in your head so you don&#39;t go through  <br/>
the torture that you were made to do in school: If they ask &quot;What&#39;s 23 <br/>
+18?&quot; (say they have two toys they want to buy and want to know if  <br/>
they have enough.) &quot;That&#39;d be the same as 21+20 so 41.&quot; *Estimate*  <br/>
when things get large. &quot;How many times does 38 go into 1234?&quot; &quot;Well,  <br/>
38&#39;s almost 40 and 1234 is a little more than 1200, so about 300.&quot; If  <br/>
they need more accuracy, use a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *much* easier for kids to learn the notation after they&#39;ve done  <br/>
lots of real, personally meaningful number manipulation that gives  <br/>
them the information they want. They learn how numbers work from that.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with kids liking math worksheets. But  <br/>
worksheets will get in the way of a parent grasping unschooling if  <br/>
the parent sees something necessary in the worksheets that the child  <br/>
will miss without them. They should be seen as just something to play  <br/>
with, like a coloring book or a crossword puzzle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781510192">Here&#39;s something I wrote for a local list that might be helpful -- Joyce<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; I&#39;m just wondering whether anybody in the group has ever used any of<br/>
 &gt; the Mindsprinting programs before, or know of anyone who has? If so,<br/>
 &gt; do you have any thoughts/critiques to offer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unnecessary is my first reaction. My second reaction is that it&#39;s  <br/>
bringing the stress of school home.<br/>
<br/>
My third reaction after taking the test has unfortunately spawned an  <br/>
evilly long rant on how poorly schools approach math and how much  <br/>
damage they do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to, try taking the 5th grade test and notice how  <br/>
high your frustration level goes. Notice how bad you feel about your  <br/>
math skills.<br/>
<br/>
I have a degree in electrical engineering. The test told me (as I  <br/>
posed as a 5th grader named Joan) that I was performing on a 4th  <br/>
grade level. Yeah. Right. Down below my rant is their list of the  <br/>
areas I need to work on.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some sample questions. *No* calculators. (There were a total  <br/>
of 20.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Divide 6847 by 43.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember, no calculators. Why is my question. This is ancient  <br/>
dinosaur thinking that math teachers have passed down to math  <br/>
teachers since the beginning of schools. As a present for my freshman  <br/>
year in college in 1974 I got an early electronic calculator. You had  <br/>
to get them through the mail from Hewlett Packard. It was a  <br/>
&quot;scientific&quot; calculator meaning it could do square roots and squares.  <br/>
They were $150. (How much is that in 2008 dollars? ;-) That was *34*  <br/>
years ago. I haven&#39;t done long division for *34* years. Before that  <br/>
people used *slide rules*.<br/>
<br/>
*WHY* are kids being made to do these ridiculous calculations by  <br/>
hand? Math teachers will tell you they need to know. As an engineer,  <br/>
I will tell you that&#39;s a lie.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s *really* useful is for kids to *use* numbers in ways that are  <br/>
meaningful to them, to get answers that mean something to what&#39;s  <br/>
important to the kids. (And I can not understate how useful video  <br/>
games are for using math concepts in real ways!)<br/>
<br/>
While my daughter is *not* a math head -- she&#39;s more of an artist and  <br/>
writer -- she played a lot of video games. I also walked myself  <br/>
through problems when she needed an answer so she could see how I was  <br/>
manipulating the numbers to get to an answer. While her father did  <br/>
show her some cool stuff like Fibonacci numbers, the amount of math  <br/>
she had each week was on the order of minutes compared to hours for  <br/>
schooled kids. When she was 14 she decided it would be fun to take  <br/>
the college math course (Statistics) her father taught. While she did  <br/>
have him on hand to ask questions of while doing homework, she took  <br/>
the tests just like the rest of the students. She was at or near the  <br/>
top of the class. A class full of students 4-5 years older with 12+  <br/>
years of math. (She went on to take several other math courses for  <br/>
fun, one without him as teacher. Again, doing at or near the top of  <br/>
the class.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s useful to be able to get a rough guesstimate to problems like  <br/>
the one given. (The verbal walk through I would have given my  <br/>
daughter is: I would bump the first number up to 7000 and the second  <br/>
down to 40. Then 100 times 40 is 4000 and 200 times 40 is 8000. So  <br/>
the answer is closer to but less than 200. That gives you a ball park  <br/>
answer which is adequate for real life.) If I need an accurate  <br/>
answer, I&#39;m not going to rely on calculating by hand. I&#39;m going to  <br/>
use a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Calculate the amount of elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds<br/>
 &gt; from 4:30:15 a.m. to 12:24:31 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just looking at that makes me want to pull my hair out. *When* would  <br/>
anyone need to know down to the second how much time between those  <br/>
two? *When* would anyone need to know without a calculator?<br/>
<br/>
*If* someone was in some field where such calculations were common,  <br/>
they probably would eventually figure out tricks to do it quickly. 10  <br/>
yo kids don&#39;t need tortured with such inanities that they&#39;re unlikely  <br/>
to ever use.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Hiro would like to visit Japan, the homeland of his grandfather.<br/>
 &gt; The trip will cost him 200,000 Japanese yen. How much will Hiro&#39;s<br/>
 &gt; trip cost him in American dollars? ($1.00 U.S. = 117.51 Yen)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is big into manga and anime and we&#39;ve often wanted to  <br/>
calculate how much some number of yen in a manga is in US dollars.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you the trick: 1 yen is about a penny. That gets you close  <br/>
enough to get a feel for what kind of money they&#39;re talking about.  <br/>
Just move the decimal point over two places. 200,000 yen is  <br/>
approximately $2000.<br/>
<br/>
But for this problem, first, if the guy is booking a flight from the  <br/>
US to Japan on the computer, they&#39;re not going to quote him a price  <br/>
in yen. It&#39;s going to be in dollars. Okay, no matter. Say he needs  <br/>
grandpa to wire him the money so needs to tell him how many yen.  <br/>
Maybe he&#39;s going through some Japanese booking center. (Grumble.  <br/>
Stupid made up question.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he&#39;s got the browser open. He types into the search box in  <br/>
Google:<br/>
<br/>
convert 200000 yen into US$<br/>
<br/>
and it comes back and tells him:<br/>
<br/>
200 000 Japanese yen = 1 869.2 US$<br/>
<br/>
Quicker, more accurate, with up to the minute currency values than  <br/>
doing it by hand with an out of date conversion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Find the volume of the frustum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What the heck is a frustum? Well, one could guess from the picture  <br/>
with the question. (Yahoo blocks pictures so I can&#39;t show you but you  <br/>
could type it into Google Image if you wanted to see.) The word  <br/>
itself might actually be interesting for some kids. It has a cool  <br/>
sound. But by this point in the test, I&#39;d bet a lot of kids would  <br/>
feel inadequate that they don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t worry, kids. Life is an  <br/>
open book test. If frustum *ever* comes up in real life, someone will  <br/>
tell you or you&#39;ll be able to look it up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Select the drawing that shows triangle ABC with median BR using a<br/>
 &gt; compass and a straight edge.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I probably got this one wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the question is that you have no idea why it&#39;s being  <br/>
asked and what information you want to extract from what&#39;s given.<br/>
<br/>
In real life that wouldn&#39;t be true. In real life, you&#39;d understand  <br/>
why the problem is set up that way and why you wanted the answer and  <br/>
what you wanted to do with the answer once you had it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; If it costs $3.50 for each person to swim, how much money did the<br/>
 &gt; pool make last weekend?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not far off questions that actually come up in real life.<br/>
<br/>
(At least that&#39;s what I said originally. On second glance, it&#39;s not.  <br/>
The question is stupid.<br/>
If the pool charges everyone the same, they&#39;re not going to know how  <br/>
many of each they have.<br/>
But, it is *vaguely* similar to real life questions.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that when kids who aren&#39;t grasping math are faced with  <br/>
these word problems over and over, they tend to freeze up over time  <br/>
and their brains shut down at the first hint of something that smells  <br/>
like a word problem. So even when faced with a real life one that  <br/>
they actually care about, they can cringe and feel like they can&#39;t do  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But when things like this are just part of life, when mom walks  <br/>
through *real life* problems in front of the kids while she finds an  <br/>
answer for them (or lets them if they&#39;re saying &quot;No, don&#39;t tell  <br/>
me!&quot;), the problems aren&#39;t scary and kids can see why the problem is  <br/>
worded as it is because the kids understand the real context and they  <br/>
know why they want to know an answer.<br/>
<br/>
(In this particular problem, the pie chart showing how many adults,  <br/>
children and students there were was too small to read.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Draw an expression for the situation below. Matt has 4 more video<br/>
 &gt; games than Sarah. Sarah has x video games. How many video games<br/>
 &gt; does Matt have?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To make things really confusing, the answer was &quot;None of the above.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When does anyone ever solve problems like that? They&#39;re fun for kids  <br/>
who love puzzles. And you can buy books of them -- *not* workbooks,  <br/>
but *real* puzzle books -- at grocery store checkouts and book stores.<br/>
<br/>
While this problem is a math book version of an algebra problem,  <br/>
again, the huge problem with it is that when would someone ever set  <br/>
up a problem that way and why do they want the answer?<br/>
<br/>
Real life problems have meaning. When my daughter was 10ish maybe --  <br/>
and without demonstrating any previous need or desire to set up such  <br/>
problems -- she asked, &quot;Do you know how long it would take to drive  <br/>
from Boston to LA?&quot; At the time we were in the Pittsburgh airport. We  <br/>
were waiting for a flight to LA. We had driven from Boston to  <br/>
Pittsburgh a lot to see my father so she knew driving took 11 hours.  <br/>
She knew the flight had taken -- I can&#39;t remember now, but say 3  <br/>
hours. She knew the next leg of the flight was 6 (guessing again.) So  <br/>
she said 33 hours. Absolutely spot on algebraic reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
*That&#39;s* real life algebra. She could see how all the pieces fit  <br/>
together. She had a desire for the answer. She found a way to use  <br/>
what she knew to find out what she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Find the mean of the following numbers: 19, 13, 25, 21, 19, 5<br/>
 &gt; Remember, no calculator.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Not tortured enough? Do it again. Find the median of the following<br/>
 &gt; numbers: 14, 19, 17, 14, 24, 14<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Find the mode of the following numbers: 10, 3, 23, 20, 23, 13, 13<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You *do* of course remember what a mode is, don&#39;t you? You&#39;ve  <br/>
probably used it 100s of times in real life.<br/>
<br/>
No, you haven&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
While some people do use modes (I used them in programming and the  <br/>
professor explained them in a couple of minutes), and probably some  <br/>
branches of statistics. 10 yos don&#39;t need modes.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will get a kick out of them. But there&#39;s absolutely no  <br/>
reason to make a 10 yo learn them. There&#39;s even more of a reason not  <br/>
to make a 10 yo feel inadequate for not knowing or not caring.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Find the odds against rolling a 5 or a 6 on a die.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really liked probability in college. It was a nice respite before  <br/>
we hit statistics ;-) While kids might have fun with probability,  <br/>
they don&#39;t need to learn it when they&#39;re 10. It&#39;s easy to grasp,  <br/>
takes minutes to learn when you&#39;re 18. Hours and hours when you&#39;re 10  <br/>
if you don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re being made to do it. (And the  <br/>
danger is that kids will decide they either hate math or that they&#39;re  <br/>
dumb at math.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was a few of the questions. And here&#39;s what the site says  <br/>
I need to work on. Goodness, there were only 20 questions! At most I  <br/>
may have missed a couple of the geometry ones (since I took the  <br/>
practical route and used a calculator). If I were intimidated by  <br/>
math, I&#39;d feel really stupid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037485660">Math Power, How to help your child love math, even if you don&#39;t by Patricia Kenschaft is a great book for understanding math. It is written for parents with kids in public school and she is a mathematician who has taught at a teacher&#39;s college for over a generation. But I find it easy to discard the schooly stuff. She has some great unschooling points, such as, things like sorting silverware are all about set theory. Especially if you have mismatched silverware, like we do. There is math all around us if you stop and mindfully think about it. And when I do notice it, I can share it with my kids. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I love math, although I am terrible at calculations, so our kids are exposed to math in lots of different ways. My oldest and youngest do calculations in their heads but my middle son (15) is worse than I am. But he has a calculator on his cell phone. Calculations are just a tiny part of math and I made it through advanced calculus in college without being good at them and that was before there were calculators. <br/>
<br/>
My son did use text books to go through from algebra to calculus with me but he wanted to, and he picked out which books worked for him. We used an interesting assortment. It was also really great bonding time for us since I went through it with him. I wasn&#39;t teaching him but scribing for him because he didn&#39;t hand write.  He loves that he knows the math and won&#39;t have to take it in college, unless he wants to. And from being totally math phobic when he left school in 3rd grade, he now reads Ian Stewart for fun. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a child who is really into math, they can always find someone who will help them dive into the math concepts with them. And then your child can teach them to you, if you are interested. <br/>

For me, unschooling is a goldmine of choice/options!  Like many of us, I<br/>
grew up without the acknowledgement of my ability to choose much of anything<br/>
for myself, and &quot;had to&quot; credit my parents with decision making power.  Is<br/>
that at least somewhat why I have too often made them responsible for my<br/>
childhood?  I really don&#39;t like it at all, the unwanted opportunity to judge<br/>
the product of childhood.<br/>
<br/>
My personal growth has always been and continues to be my own process,<br/>
whether or not acknowledged as such by anyone.  In a very real sense,<br/>
unschooling gives me the chance to reclaim my childhood for the process that<br/>
it still is, as the inner child lives on.<br/>
<br/>
Back to what you said, Verna, I love how you talk about math.  I never could<br/>
memorize anything either and I am finally friendly with numbers in the sense<br/>
of how they work, which I wasn&#39;t when I was in school.  :)  Cool huh?<br/>

<br/>
When I quit being a teacher, I was at an employment agency in  <br/>
Albuquerque one day and they had clerical tests.  They asked how fast  <br/>
I typed, and I hadn&#39;t been tested for over ten years, and I only went  <br/>
about 42 WPM then, so I looked pained and said &quot;60?&quot;  I tested at  <br/>
over 80.   They guy looked at me half with admiration, and half with  <br/>
the idea that I must be an idiot.  But I had been typing letters, and  <br/>
newsletters, and exercises for the kids at school (because I never  <br/>
used the textbook) and song lyrics.  Not &quot;real&quot; typing.  I had never  <br/>
been a secretary where my typing skills were in competition with  <br/>
others doing the same kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
So he asked if I could use a ten-key.  I said I don&#39;t know what that  <br/>
is.  So he showed me a calculator he had there on the desk, and I  <br/>
said &quot;OH!  Yeah, I can use that without looking at it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then he *knew* I was an idiot. &lt;g&gt;  But I had been using a calculator  <br/>
to average grades for 130 students at least four times a year for six  <br/>
years, and for balancing my checking account, and because my math  <br/>
confidence was damaged by school, I usually did each thing two or  <br/>
three times.  I&#39;d do it twice for sure, and if I got the same answer  <br/>
the second time, I didn&#39;t go for the tie-breaker third time.<br/>

<br/>
I can never, ever, remember the formula for calculating percentages,  <br/>
but when I need to do that and I&#39;m away from equipment or a computer,  <br/>
I figure it out with something out of ten, move the numbers around  <br/>
until I see the formula, and plug the problematical numbers in there.<br/>
<br/>
And when I was at a huge event (Pennsic XIII, for those who know or  <br/>
care) and we were informed that all merchants had to register and pay  <br/>
Pennsylvania sales tax (not easy in those days, when leather belts  <br/>
were taxed and cloth belts were, and the list of what wasn&#39;t taxable  <br/>
was WAY more complicated than Texas ever imagined in their bluest  <br/>
blue-laws days when you couldn&#39;t buy a broom on a Sunday)...    I  <br/>
figured out how to umbrella us all under the treasurer of the  <br/>
corporation (who was there, and a friend of mine, and that year I was  <br/>
president, which didn&#39;t hurt, and was a merchant too, so I needed to  <br/>
know from both angles).  I also figured out the formula for how to  <br/>
just take the tax out of the gross without adding it on and then  <br/>
taking it off.  I don&#39;t remember what it was, but I&#39;m going to say  <br/>
8%.  If tax is 8% and you don&#39;t want to add it, and  you don&#39;t want  <br/>
to change all your prices, you don&#39;t keep 92 cents out of a dollar.   <br/>
You keep more.  Because 8% of 92 cents is less than 8 cents.<br/>
<br/>
I was babbling in English to all these math-types all around me  <br/>
trying to get them to help me figure out how to calculate how to take  <br/>
tax OUT of the dollar, not stick it on top, and they were frustrating  <br/>
me because they couldn&#39;t see what I was getting at.  And I&#39;m the one  <br/>
who dropped out of math classes at 15.   Some of them has masters&#39;  <br/>
degrees in mathy stuff, and the corporate treasurer was an accountant  <br/>
for Ragu.  But Ragu doesn&#39;t make you figure things out, just keep  <br/>
books the way they tell you to do.<br/>

computation bingo cards that she loves too.  I figure out most of the<br/>
answers for her, but sometimes she beats me to the answer.  She&#39;s 7 and<br/>
has never had a math lesson in her life.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I figured out about a year ago, with her is that she<br/>
comes to her answers very differently than I do.  I&#39;ve hesitated<br/>
figuring out the answers out loud for her because I don&#39;t want to mess<br/>
up or confuse what she&#39;s got going on in her head already.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used her system to give her answers.  It works great for her.  It<br/>
sometimes confuses me, causes me to &quot;translate&quot; in my head, so to speak.<br/>
What I became keenly aware of, is that people who teach math to kids,<br/>
effectively shut down that natural process that kids do on their own,<br/>
which is soooo effective to each individual.  Teaching math forces a set<br/>
way to figure out math computation to get a right answer.  Really, what<br/>
kids should be doing is finding their own way to make sense of it, then<br/>
double checking with the answer to make sure their computation is right.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux figures things out in multiples of 3&#39;s and 6&#39;s, and the rest are<br/>
remainders kind of that get added on.  She does her computation of<br/>
whatever it is she is trying to figure out and then double checks with<br/>
me, if her answer is right.  It&#39;s mostly always right, if it&#39;s divisible<br/>
by 3, then it&#39;s always right.  She uses this system all the way up to<br/>
100 or so, then she gets confused by the triple digits.</div>

understands basic math concepts, she knows money really really well. <br/>
She can find which item in a grocery store is the better deal quickly,<br/>
with hardly any time at all, quicker than me.<br/>
<br/>
I checked out the sample tests for her age, and I couldn&#39;t do about half<br/>
the problems.  It was math that I never encountered in all my schooling.<br/>
So, even though I think my daughter is really great at the math she<br/>
knows and uses in real life, that&#39;s not what was on the test.  It would<br/>
have left her feeling inadequate and stupid and frustrated.  And for<br/>
what?  Some person that works for the school district would have made<br/>
her redo it until she got a high enough score for their standards.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth it!<br/>

only whether the person in question is taking their own development<br/>

&quot;good enough&quot; at them.  Since I was encouraged to quit the piano I<br/>
figured I wasn&#39;t.  I hope very much to spare my unschooling kids this<br/>
way of looking at the world.  I want them to play or sing or whatever<br/>
because they want to and because they can always improve their skills<br/>
if they put time and energy into them.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think your family needs to be more confident in what they  <br/>
know and what they can do.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you can relax and smile and support and provide (food,  <br/>
time, space, materials, ideas) for them, you will see more and more  <br/>
learning yourself.  But you don&#39;t need to say anything.  It can spoil  <br/>
the mood entirely to say &quot;look what you&#39;re learning!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to &quot;try to overdo&quot; providing an environment&quot; but you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t stop trying to provide one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245760094">Sandra, I think the piece in your multiple intelligences section from<br/>
Zen Lessons about the talent/capacity not being something you change<br/>
is a good point.  I would say this is something unschoolers are<br/>
implementing well in letting children just be who they are and pursue<br/>
things because they want to, because they (the kids) value those<br/>
things, and whether someone else thinks they&#39;re good or bad at it<br/>
doesn&#39;t come into the equation.  Our culture is very big into<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; and &quot;qualifications&quot; and unschooling is (thankfully) not,<br/>
although there&#39;s nothing to stop unschoolers from becoming really<br/>
qualified experts in their own right, for their own reasons.  I think<br/>
what I meant by &quot;is taking their development seriously&quot; was actually<br/>
something more like &quot;values the time and energy they give to music&quot;. <br/>
I can see why it comes across differently so that&#39;s a helpful<br/>
clarification for me.  Although actually I think I was also trying to<br/>
suggest there might not be a line at all.  It always comes back to<br/>
freedom, doesn&#39;t it? In this case, the freedom to pursue what you<br/>
enjoy without needing permission.<br/>

Yes.  Whether or not anyone considers the activity to be well executed is<br/>
separate from the enjoyment and pursuit of it.  You can be a musician for 5<br/>
minutes of your life (just barely sampling a few notes here and there) or 5<br/>
decades.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244151659">Thank you for this post Joyce! I thought it was a GREAT look at math<br/>
&quot;examples&quot; and I love how you broke it down and gave some REAL<br/>
real-life examples of math. It seems that math is an area that people<br/>
get really caught up on, even those drawn to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This was my FAVORITE line though:<br/>

This could be a slogan for unschooling I think! &quot;Life is an open book<br/>
