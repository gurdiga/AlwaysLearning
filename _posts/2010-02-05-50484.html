<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748436367">I watched this on You-tube (it is quite long, 1 hour 15 minutes) and it provoked some thoughts/questions for me. I thought others may be interested in watching too if they haven&#39;t seen it. <br/>

One thing I found interesting was towards the end she talks about possible negatives with unschooling. It seemed like the major &quot;flaw&quot; she brought up was that the population that probably needs alternative education the most does not have access to it. That by keeping children home public education is further weakened.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that probably the people who &quot;need&quot; unschooling the most may be the ones least likely to get it. But by larger extension the kids that &quot;need&quot; better parents more are the ones least likely to get them too! Kind of a ridiculous argument.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like my ultimate responsibility is to my kids and family, not to &quot;society at large&quot;. As a former teacher too, I don&#39;t believe that sending my children to school will necessarily help the state of public education. And how would my children be different if they were sent to school versus unschooled? Which is ultimately &quot;better&quot; for society?<br/>
<br/>
Just some of my thoughts after watching this... <br/>

i came across this article today:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://meredithfsmall.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/orchids-and-dandelions/">http://meredithfsmall.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/orchids-and-dandelions/</a><br/>
<br/>
and the abstract of the article it&#39;s based on<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/sfri-hst012910.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/sfri-hst012910.php</a><br/>
<br/>
i think it&#39;s really fascinating and really speaks to how healing and &quot;right&quot; unschooling is for so many kids.  and also - i think  many of kids who are unschooling are &quot;atypical&quot; or more like &quot;orchids&quot; than dandelions, and therefore do really need that environment...<br/>
<br/>
them being in public school would NOT strengthen the public  school experience, because they&#39;d be suffering and withering there, and that doesn&#39;t make things better for the &quot;dandelions&quot;.<br/>
