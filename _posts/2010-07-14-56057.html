 </span></blockquote>When my husband tried to get a passport a few years back they said he needed a birth certificate issued within a month of his birth.  his was issued a year and a month from his birth, I am thinking when his adoption was finalized.  Well all we had to do is pay a fee and voila, we had a birth certificate issued within a month of his birth.  Looks just like the other one but with a false date of issue.  I guess the State falsifies birth certicates like that all the time.</div>
