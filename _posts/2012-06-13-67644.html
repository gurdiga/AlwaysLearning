<div id="ygrps-yiv-537338900">Two posts today from moms comparing older daughters and younger sons - and<br/>
in both cases the girls come off as easy and docile while the boys are<br/>
aggressive and physical.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that moms very often vastly underestimate the amount of<br/>
physical activity their kids need and they think there is something wrong<br/>
with their kids when what they really need is many more hours of physical<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
My siblings and I played outdoors from morning &#39;til night, as kids. We ran<br/>
and jumped and tumbled and skated and biked and climbed and dug and chased<br/>
and roughhoused like crazy. I also spent many hours in water almost every<br/>
single day during the summer.<br/>
<br/>
On school days I walked/ran to and from school, had at least two recesses a<br/>
class physical education time (we played games like Capture the Flag,<br/>
dodgeball, and Red Rover Red Rover) and a lunch break (I ran home for lunch<br/>
and back quickly to spend time playing on the playground), and we had NO<br/>
homework so the minute I got home from school I changed into pants/shorts<br/>
because girls had to wear dresses to school in those days and ran back<br/>
outside to play with neighborhood kids. Play consisted very largely of<br/>
hide-and-seek, kick-the-can, stickball, kickball, a wide variety of tag<br/>
games, mother-may-I, lemonade, red light green light, duck duck goose, and<br/>
a TON of hopscotch. I roller skated and rode my bike and we had rudimentary<br/>
skateboards (we took apart our skates and nailed them to boards). We had<br/>
pogo sticks and slip-n-slides and hula hoops. We often went over to the<br/>
school playground and played on the equipment - rings, slides, swings. We<br/>
played foursquare a lot. My neighbor had a trampoline and we bounced and<br/>
bounced and bounced.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every evening of my childhood I was physically worn out - very<br/>
grubby and tired and ready to have some dinner, a bath, watch a little tv,<br/>
have some stories or have mom or dad sing to us kids, maybe play with my<br/>
sisters with dolls or something for a little while and often fall asleep<br/>
reading a book.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;I&quot; was a fairly sedentary kid compared to many! I was a bookworm kid<br/>
who loved board and card games.<br/>
<br/>
Children haven&#39;t changed - their physical needs haven&#39;t changed - since the<br/>
50&#39;s or 60&#39;s. Some kids need more and others need less physical activity,<br/>
but when a parent thinks a kid is &quot;hyper&quot; or &quot;bounces off the walls&quot; or<br/>
complains about a kid&#39;s aggressive behaviors and so on -  the parent<br/>
probably has no idea the sheer quantity of physically strenuous activity<br/>
that that child needs.<br/>
<br/>
People these days will say, &quot;He&#39;s got soccer 3 days a week,&quot; as if that is<br/>
supposed to give him enough opportunity for physical activity. First, I<br/>
love soccer for many kids, but it is a structured-by-adults activity in<br/>
which a child has to control his physical urges for much of the time. He<br/>
has to wait, stand in line, use the part of his body he is supposed to use.<br/>
It is not at all the same as structured-by-the-kids-themselves play. And, a<br/>
few hours a week is completely inadequate for most kids as an energy burn<br/>
off. They more likely need a few hours every day.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, kids are different. Not all kids want or need a lot of physical<br/>
activity. Some will climb a tree and sit up on a branch and read a book for<br/>
hours - not hang and swing and jump and balance. But ONLY the child can<br/>
really know how much physical activity he or she needs and the child can<br/>
only figure that out in the context of having plentiful free and<br/>
unstructured time for it.<br/>
<br/>
Boys, on the average, need even greater amounts of strenuous physical<br/>
activity than girls. That they tend to be more aggressive has to do with<br/>
hormones they experience even in the womb. Again - there is a big range and<br/>
some girls have greater physical needs than some boys and vice versa - but<br/>
moms seem to very often have a hard time with how physical their little<br/>
boys are. The same can be true for moms of girls who happen to have<br/>
extremely high physical energy needs.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes dads help the moms understand their boys&#39; physical needs, but<br/>
when dads are busy working all day and it is mom who is home with the kids,<br/>
boys can end up being very much not getting their needs met and moms end up<br/>
thinking there is something wrong with their little boys.<br/>
<br/>
Of course all of this is made much worse by school, where all kids are<br/>
expected to sit still much of the time. But homeschooling moms can have<br/>
unrealistic expectations, too. And I think many of their sons suffer for it<br/>
(and some of their daughters, too).<br/>

I&#39;ve just finished three days of speaking every afternoon, at a campground in France.  We&#39;re sitting in the covered patio of a restaurant/bar that&#39;s also the campground&#39;s office.  The table I chose as &quot;the desk,&quot; the podium, faces out, toward the big trampoline and the swimming pool.  I&#39;ve watched kids play all the time, even in the rain.  Right now, five kids from age three to thirteen are running and chasing through here, in and out the various doors, and it&#39;s sweet that they let the littlest guys chase along too.<br/>
<br/>
The opportunity for the kids to run and play has been what will be memorable for them from this week.<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts a few weeks back, there was a gathering at a camp with a gagaball pit.  We figured the kids might want to try that out once, maybe.  They tried it out for two days straight. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are also kids here off and on playing Uno or iPad games.  <br/>

<br/>
Is there a reason why you are not playing with him? why is he alone? <br/>
Play with him!!! Chase him, race him, play tag, ball, catch, go bike together!<br/>
Jump ropes together!  Have pillow fights, tickle fights ( my son absolutely loves loves that !)<br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of parents wanting their kids to do something but just expecting them to do it alone or with other kids. <br/>
Join the children! Connect with him.  Have fun together. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if something else is going on here. He&#39;s your oldest,  <br/>
but he has two siblings - one born when he was only a year old. Is  <br/>
there any chance that he&#39;s not getting enough attention from you?<br/>
<br/>
Kids, especially sensitive ones, can feel quite resentful because they  <br/>
have been displaced by their younger sibs. There&#39;s a lovely myth about  <br/>
an older child falling in love with the new baby, being the younger  <br/>
one&#39;s protector, etc. But when the older kid hits the new baby, people  <br/>
wonder why and blame him. They expect too much from a very young  <br/>
child, who&#39;s missing his mom and her undivided love.<br/>
<br/>
Loving up your 5 year old in a major way might help. Spend more time  <br/>
with him alone, so he knows *he&#39;s* as important as his younger sister  <br/>
and brother. Ask dad to hang with him on his own, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996061767">I realize an apartment may not have a lot of space - but it is worth it to<br/>
clear out some furniture to make enough space for large-body play.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-trampolines in front of the tv!! We ended up, at one time, with two of<br/>
them and that was a HUGE draw - to bounce back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
Twister - the game.<br/>
<br/>
Hula hoops can be used indoors.<br/>
<br/>
Tunnels, yo-yos, spinny things you stand on.<br/>
<br/>
Bean bag toss games -- here is one you can buy, but you can just make bean<br/>
bags (fill tube socks with rice or beans or hard corn and tie a knot in the<br/>
end) and find places to throw them - allow for him to be able to throw<br/>
HARD, not just gently toss, too.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/tiki-bean-bag-toss-game-a2-34_1884.fltr?prodCatId=388930&tabId=4">http://www.orientaltrading.com/tiki-bean-bag-toss-game-a2-34_1884.fltr?prodCatId=388930&tabId=4</a><br/>
<br/>
Oriental trading company also has an inflatable limbo game. But you could<br/>
just play limbo with him using a broomstick.<br/>
<br/>
Play &quot;run, jump, punch&quot; - duct tape a &quot;target&quot; (something he can punch - an<br/>
old throw pillow, for example) onto a broom handle - hold it out and let<br/>
him run at it and punch it (or jump/kick it, even better). Then hold it a<br/>
little higher and a little higher - make it more of a challenge (but not so<br/>
high as to frustrate him - this is supposed to be fun).<br/>
<br/>
Paddle balls - those things with a little rubber ball connected to a paddle<br/>
with elastic.<br/>
<br/>
Balloons - play together trying to keep a balloon in the air. Same with<br/>
feathers.<br/>
<br/>
We had a big peacock feather for years - and the kids would move all over<br/>
the room trying to keep it balanced on the tip of their finger.<br/>
<br/>
Play hopscotch in the house. I bought a set of placemats at a thrift store<br/>
- plastic ones. I got several sets. We ended up writing numbers on them and<br/>
the kids would lay them out in the living room and play hopscotch on them<br/>
(and use them as part of their obstacle courses).<br/>
<br/>
Also play &quot;sharks&quot; or &quot;lava&quot; - put old placemats or sheets of newspaper or<br/>
anything else - all over the room, just far enough apart that it is a<br/>
challenge to go from one to the other and then hop around pretending that<br/>
if you step off either the sharks will get you or you&#39;ll be in hot lava.<br/>
<br/>
Those big cardboard brick building blocks (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Giant-Building-Block-40-piece-Set/dp/B00005ICC4)">http://www.amazon.com/Giant-Building-Block-40-piece-Set/dp/B00005ICC4)</a><br/>
 Combine these with small tables and chairs and cushions and more - to<br/>
build BIG structures.<br/>
<br/>
Drag home large appliance boxes if you see them - kids can find all kinds<br/>
of ways to play with them and they encourage large muscle play.<br/>
<br/>
Those little parachute guys that he can climb up high and drop (or look<br/>
online you can make these easily).<br/>
<br/>
Put up a short step ladder in the middle of the living room - play pretend<br/>
with it. Drop parachutes off it. Every time he climbs up and down - that&#39;s<br/>
good!<br/>
<br/>
Jump ropes - play &quot;snakes&quot; by wiggling it as you move around the room and<br/>
he tries to stomp it. Make up more games with ropes.<br/>
<br/>
Make &quot;obstacle courses&quot; throughout the apartment - put couch cushions and<br/>
pieces of newspaper and other things (a mini trampoline in there somewhere)<br/>
and things to crawl over and crawl under (coffee tables, chairs) and get a<br/>
stopwatch to time it.<br/>
<br/>
Dance - put on happy high-energy music and dance around the apartment. My<br/>
kids liked scarves - long flowing scarves to wave around while they danced.<br/>
There are really cheap little paper thingies that sort of unwind and you<br/>
wave them around in patters while you dance - like gymnasts use.<br/>
<br/>
Punching bags! Those bouncy balls kids can sit on and bounce around. I know<br/>
I know - doesn&#39;t seem safe for indoors - MAKE it safe.<br/>
<br/>
Make it a priority - spend at hours every single day outdoors where he can<br/>
run and play. Play WITH him if he&#39;s not finding other kids to play with. If<br/>
you&#39;re having fun together, why would he be sitting and crying. Take bubble<br/>
stuff and weird bubble wands that you make out of pipe cleaners. Do the<br/>
mentos experiment. Get those cheap little balsa wood gliders and fly those<br/>
(and chase them). Make a little scooter ramp to take to the park. Make life<br/>
outdoors fun and run around with him and climb up on the playground<br/>
equipment with him and slide down the slide and haul water for him so he<br/>
can build castles with moats in the sandbox.<br/>
<br/>
That he has trouble sharing isn&#39;t a reason to not take him out. Be there to<br/>
help. Think ahead - take something that he is willing to share or don&#39;t<br/>
take toys at all. Most kids on playgrounds don&#39;t bring their own toys -<br/>
mostly they play on the playground equipment. Second - you don&#39;t have to go<br/>
to playgrounds - go to parts of parks where there are trees and bushes to<br/>
run around in, too. Take a ball and play with him.<br/>
<br/>
Playing in the bathtub is really good - being immersed in water is an<br/>
extraordinary calming and physically nurturing thing. Bathtub play was kind<br/>
of a lifesaver for me with my extremely high-energy and intense kid! I&#39;d<br/>
put all kinds of things in the tub - egg beaters, cups and bowls, measuring<br/>
cups, basters, and so on. An empty tub and a big huge bowl of instant<br/>
pudding was great - they played and played with it - and it washed right<br/>
away. Bubble baths - of course - but be creative with them (add flavorings<br/>
like pineapple or chocolate to the water, for example). Baths were really a<br/>
focal point of our days during winter months. (Put towels on the floor and<br/>
don&#39;t worry about it getting wet.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is very sad when a child is diagnosed as having ADD or hyperactivity or<br/>
whatever - but the kid is a rambunctious little one who is mostly being<br/>
kept indoors in an apartment and not getting hours of strenuous big-body<br/>
play time every day - then the poor kid gets drugged and treated and talked<br/>
about as if there is something wrong with him! Instead of considering him<br/>
as disabled in some way and trying to treat it - consider him as an<br/>
extremely rambunctious kiddo who needs a tremendous amount of physical<br/>
activity. Make it your goal and your priority that he is physically worn<br/>
out at the end of every single day. End the day with long playtime in the<br/>
bathtub.<br/>
<br/>
Focus your own energy on being super creative about fun things to do<br/>
together that involve large-muscle activity.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Two posts today from moms comparing older daughters and younger sons - and<br/>
&gt; &gt;in both cases the girls come off as easy and docile while the boys are<br/>
&gt; &gt;aggressive and physical.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve noticed that moms very often vastly underestimate the amount of<br/>
&gt; &gt;physical activity their kids need and they think there is something wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt;with their kids when what they really need is many more hours of physical<br/>
&gt; &gt;activity.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My siblings and I played outdoors from morning &#39;til night, as kids. We ran<br/>
&gt; &gt;and jumped and tumbled and skated and biked and climbed and dug and chased<br/>
&gt; &gt;and roughhoused like crazy. I also spent many hours in water almost every<br/>
&gt; &gt;single day during the summer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On school days I walked/ran to and from school, had at least two recesses<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;class physical education time (we played games like Capture the Flag,<br/>
&gt; &gt;dodgeball, and Red Rover Red Rover) and a lunch break (I ran home for<br/>
&gt; lunch<br/>
&gt; &gt;and back quickly to spend time playing on the playground), and we had NO<br/>
&gt; &gt;homework so the minute I got home from school I changed into pants/shorts<br/>
&gt; &gt;because girls had to wear dresses to school in those days and ran back<br/>
&gt; &gt;outside to play with neighborhood kids. Play consisted very largely of<br/>
&gt; &gt;hide-and-seek, kick-the-can, stickball, kickball, a wide variety of tag<br/>
&gt; &gt;games, mother-may-I, lemonade, red light green light, duck duck goose, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;a TON of hopscotch. I roller skated and rode my bike and we had<br/>
&gt; rudimentary<br/>
&gt; &gt;skateboards (we took apart our skates and nailed them to boards). We had<br/>
&gt; &gt;pogo sticks and slip-n-slides and hula hoops. We often went over to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;school playground and played on the equipment - rings, slides, swings. We<br/>
&gt; &gt;played foursquare a lot. My neighbor had a trampoline and we bounced and<br/>
&gt; &gt;bounced and bounced.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Nearly every evening of my childhood I was physically worn out - very<br/>
&gt; &gt;grubby and tired and ready to have some dinner, a bath, watch a little tv,<br/>
&gt; &gt;have some stories or have mom or dad sing to us kids, maybe play with my<br/>
&gt; &gt;sisters with dolls or something for a little while and often fall asleep<br/>
&gt; &gt;reading a book.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And &quot;I&quot; was a fairly sedentary kid compared to many! I was a bookworm kid<br/>
&gt; &gt;who loved board and card games.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Children haven&#39;t changed - their physical needs haven&#39;t changed - since<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;50&#39;s or 60&#39;s. Some kids need more and others need less physical activity,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but when a parent thinks a kid is &quot;hyper&quot; or &quot;bounces off the walls&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &gt;complains about a kid&#39;s aggressive behaviors and so on - the parent<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably has no idea the sheer quantity of physically strenuous activity<br/>
&gt; &gt;that that child needs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;People these days will say, &quot;He&#39;s got soccer 3 days a week,&quot; as if that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;supposed to give him enough opportunity for physical activity. First, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;love soccer for many kids, but it is a structured-by-adults activity in<br/>
&gt; &gt;which a child has to control his physical urges for much of the time. He<br/>
&gt; &gt;has to wait, stand in line, use the part of his body he is supposed to<br/>
&gt; use.<br/>
&gt; &gt;It is not at all the same as structured-by-the-kids-themselves play. And,<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;few hours a week is completely inadequate for most kids as an energy burn<br/>
&gt; &gt;off. They more likely need a few hours every day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yes, kids are different. Not all kids want or need a lot of physical<br/>
&gt; &gt;activity. Some will climb a tree and sit up on a branch and read a book<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;hours - not hang and swing and jump and balance. But ONLY the child can<br/>
&gt; &gt;really know how much physical activity he or she needs and the child can<br/>
&gt; &gt;only figure that out in the context of having plentiful free and<br/>
&gt; &gt;unstructured time for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Boys, on the average, need even greater amounts of strenuous physical<br/>
&gt; &gt;activity than girls. That they tend to be more aggressive has to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt;hormones they experience even in the womb. Again - there is a big range<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;some girls have greater physical needs than some boys and vice versa - but<br/>
&gt; &gt;moms seem to very often have a hard time with how physical their little<br/>
&gt; &gt;boys are. The same can be true for moms of girls who happen to have<br/>
&gt; &gt;extremely high physical energy needs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sometimes dads help the moms understand their boys&#39; physical needs, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;when dads are busy working all day and it is mom who is home with the<br/>
&gt; kids,<br/>
&gt; &gt;boys can end up being very much not getting their needs met and moms end<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking there is something wrong with their little boys.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course all of this is made much worse by school, where all kids are<br/>
&gt; &gt;expected to sit still much of the time. But homeschooling moms can have<br/>
&gt; &gt;unrealistic expectations, too. And I think many of their sons suffer for<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;(and some of their daughters, too).<br/>

<br/>
We live in a tiny apartment in New York City. My son does not like to go out (the hustle and bustle overwhelms and irritates him). Here are physical things we do inside every day:<br/>
<br/>
-we constantly play/roll on/bounce on our huge exercise ball<br/>
-jump rope . We have an ongoing contest for how many jumps we can do without messing up<br/>
-play Dance Dance Revolution<br/>
-bounce on hippety hops (Ours is bug enough for me to ride on)<br/>
-Dance to music. Everything from hip-hop to tango<br/>
-We have a game that involves trying to knock each other over with pillows on the queen-size bed<br/>
-setting up &quot;Wipe-Out&quot; style obstacle courses on the furniture (putting slip covers on things helps me to chill out about damage)<br/>
-play &quot;Bop-it Bounce&quot; ball game: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-20163-Bop-It-Bounce/dp/B0036RIMNQ">http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-20163-Bop-It-Bounce/dp/B0036RIMNQ</a><br/>
-juggle<br/>
-many many improvised games with our dog involving stuffed animals, balls, treats, etc.<br/>
-a ping-pong set that we set up on our dining room table. We use pennies to keep score and play real sets. A few weeks ago we had a friend over and played for the &quot;championship.&quot; Cheap and still a favorite after years! You can get it for about $10: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.coolstuffexpress.com/table-top-ping-pong-set.html?feed=Froogle">http://www.coolstuffexpress.com/table-top-ping-pong-set.html?feed=Froogle</a><br/>
-inflatable swords and socker boppers<br/>
-sit-and-spin<br/>
-trying to keep a ballon from touching the floor can be incredibly entertaining and active, especially for little kids.<br/>
<br/>
-a small indoor trampoline. They come with or without a handlebar.<br/>
-basketball with an over the door hoop and soft, spongy balls<br/>
-a few years ago I bought a bunch of upholstery foam remnants super cheap from a furniture repair place. We used them to build all kinds of things you could jump and fall and climb on. We stored them under the bed.<br/>
-until recently, we&#39;ve always had an indoor swing. This is the model and it&#39;s very easy to install in a doorway: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rainy-Day-Indoor-Piece-Combo/dp/B000W0A1NE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_t_1">http://www.amazon.com/Rainy-Day-Indoor-Piece-Combo/dp/B000W0A1NE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_t_1</a><br/>
It&#39;s a little pricey, but we&#39;ve used ours for over a decade (my eldest is 21).<br/>
<br/>
We do all of this and more, alone or with friends. On a bigger scale, I have scrimped and saved all year to be able to leave the city for the summer and stay at a cabin on a lake so my son can spend his days in the country swimming, which is something he loves. There are lots of solutions, big and small, for helping kids get physical needs met. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your son doesn&#39;t really enjoy crowds of other kids or playing at the park. Mine doesn&#39;t either and forcing him into those situation was harmful to him and to our relationship. Hope these ideas help.<br/>

Make forts and tunnels in the living room using blankets and cushions - crawl around and through and over them. <br/>

Twister. And make up other games to play with the board, like hopscotch, jumping from one color to another. Jumping games in general are fun - how many times can you jump? Jump on one foot? How high can you jump? Jump rope (inside, if you have the space, you can tie one end to a doornob and &quot;turn&quot; the other end for him.

<br/>
Get some flimsy fabric or scarves and dance with them. If you have a big enough piece of fabric you can toss it up in the air and try to get under it before it lands. <br/>
<br/>
Play games with balloons - volleyball, soccer, and if you can do it without disturbing  the neighbors &quot;balloon stomp&quot; where you tie a balloon to one leg and see how quickly you can break it by stepping on it. <br/>
<br/>
Toys like a sit-n-spin, a skateboard (use it sitting down), an exercise or bounce ball, an inflatable punching bag, and a mini trampoline can be stored and brought out one at a time. <br/>
<br/>
Party games like blind-mans-bluff and pin-the-tail can be played easily at home with one or two kids. Get a book of party games, or look some up on the web. <br/>
<br/>
Wind down by transitioning to something else, rather than just &quot;that&#39;s enough&quot;. A snack makes a good transition, or switch to video games or a movie. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157203996">And some more ideas from living up North and getting long winters:<br/>
We used to push all furniture towards the walls and dance dance dance and spin to music!<br/>
Obstacle course  with chairs, cushions, a beam to walk over and whatever you can find that will be fun.<br/>
Wii games and now they have those awesome Kinnect games!!! Fun for everyone!<br/>
 Mattress on the floor for jumping ( if you are not going to bother neighbors!)<br/>
I also had an inflatable jumping structure that was awesome and I got on sale one year that was really cool:<br/>

<br/>
Inflatable swords and boxing gloves to fight! ( I love to play those!)<br/>
Our treadmill has been  used to by both my kids ( warning that need to be used under very close supervision with young kids)<br/>
But my kids have used them to run  since they were a year and a half!<br/>

Hi<br/>
a book I found very interesting and useeful to help me play with my boys <br/>
was &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; from Larry Cohen. He has a website and there is <br/>
a yahoo group too.<br/>
There is lots of ideas to get closer to your children through play. It <br/>
changed the way I played with my sons and helpe me connect more with them.<br/>
