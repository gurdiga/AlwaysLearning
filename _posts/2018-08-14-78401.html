Some people are great with a phone, and you can’t even tell they weren’t at a keyboard.  Most others, though, not so.  Also the group itself is difficult to read, to search, to see the side links, the pinned post, etc.  So even the features facebook offers don’t show well on a phone, it seems.<br/>

The intention of Radical Unschooling Info was to give people links to the answers to their questions. Originally, to direct them to discussions on the Radical Unschooling Info forum (no longer there), and then to links on my site, Joyce’s, or Pam Laricchia’s.  <br/>

Now, though, when a link is sent, the person reading it on a phone might not be able to read it, or might choose “reader’s view” which sometimes doesn’t have everything, and loses some nice formatting.<br/>

Will information need to be in phone-digestible bites, from now on?<br/>
Did we go from book-length input, to magazine-article, to webpage, to phone screen?<br/>

Some have had a hard time signing up on yahoo groups A lot of them are much more savvy about Google groups and stuff than I am. Im not on Facebook for 2 1/2 years now and do not miss it. So I have no idea what&#39;s going on over there. I hardly ever use my phone to read stuff or write stuff...messes with my brain.. I use a iPad, PC, laptop.<br><br>I live in Worcester Massachusetts and over the last year or two the school system has started to behave very strangely and The Association for Home Educators in Massachusetts has been trying to coach people and they started a Yahoo group and a Facebook group to help people deal with the school system which is not following the law and getting really brutal. Like denying homeschool families who have been homeschooling for 15 years and stuff like that.&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1047967369AppleMailSignature"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1047967369AppleMailSignature">Turn of the year I was very unorganized and couldn&#39;t think straight and was overworked and I haven&#39;t been doing my paperwork right with the school system. &nbsp;And now, at age 55, &nbsp;as it turned out, I&#39;m being intensely treated for Aplastic Anemia… Didn&#39;t know my blood counts were <i><b>so</b></i> <i><b>low</b></i> and that explained some things about why things were getting hard… Punchline is I went downtown to try to make things right and they called DCF on me and so we had to go through that whole thing which was ridiculous and kind of interesting.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769997606">-=-Podcasts may slip in as the better choice for those who won’t do yahoo and find Facebook to be lacking. I listen to Pam’s regularly, and also Amy Child’s. -=-<br/>
<br/>
For anyone without quick links to those, <br/>
Amy’s:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolingsupport.com">http://unschoolingsupport.com</a><br/>
Those are short and sweet and often feature me. :-)  There are a few that are only Amy and me.  <br/>
When she die #51, of 50, which was some favorite bits that hadn’t been included for one reason or another, I listened waiting to hear myself, and was sad to find none of me.  But I was embarrassed to say “What about me?”   Then #52 came out, and it was all out-takes from interviews with me.  Then I was embarrassed again, and amused.  You might be, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Subscribe to Pam Laricchia’s mailings to get the introductions to each new interview.  The intros are GREAT, and not easy to find later. I’m not sure where the old mailings can be found, so I save some. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Each of Pam Laricchia’s podcasts has a range of accessibility, and lately, some have video.  First you can read the e-mail intro, if you’re subscribed.<br/>
That will have a link to a page that has a transcript, so you can read along if you want.  Those can be downloaded or listened to directly from her site, and many are also on YouTube.  A thorough examination of one single podcast could take a day or two. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she has interviewed someone who made me wince, but there are way more who made me sit up brightly, so glad they’d had a chance to say some wonderful things that others will hear, even years from now.<br/>
<br/>
You can subscribe to the podasts right there, at the podcast button, so you’ll only be dealing with e-mail and websites.  No facebook needed.  No Yahoogroups needed.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://livingjoyfully.ca">https://livingjoyfully.ca</a><br/>
<br/>
There’s a list of the podcasts here, down below:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://livingjoyfully.ca/podcast-2/">https://livingjoyfully.ca/podcast-2/</a><br/>
<br/>
And two of those have been interviews with me.  Both are on YouTube.  (Maybe all of hers are, now.)<br/>
They’re part of a playlist I have here, that includes some other things, too.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRaLUQfpUj7deXUV5JPwR3eYYV_wtyQX7">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRaLUQfpUj7deXUV5JPwR3eYYV_wtyQX7</a><br/>
<br/>
That’s probably WAY too much, but if you parcel it out over the next two or three years, might be fun. :-)<br/>
