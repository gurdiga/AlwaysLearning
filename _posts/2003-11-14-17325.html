Well this touched a current nerve with me!!  We&#39;re at the end of Lemony<br/>
Snickets first Unfortunate Series book and I was very surprised and<br/>
disgusted that any word that&#39;s longer than six letters is defined in the<br/>
book!!!  Hello!!!  What ever happened to picking up the meaning from the<br/>
text????  I will have to say I was already predisposed to not like the books<br/>
as I had heard and read that nothing good ever happened to the kids and I&#39;m<br/>
a sucker for happy endings. But I tried to go into them with a open mind as<br/>
my kids really wanted to listen to them (we&#39;re listening in the car) and I<br/>
had heard mixed reviews.  So that may be part of what irratates me about the<br/>
fact that he defines so many words, I feel that it interrupts the flow of<br/>
the story and that it&#39;s dumbing our kids down, let&#39;s assume that they can&#39;t<br/>
figure anything out for themselves and hand them it on a silver plate so<br/>
when they encounter that word again they won&#39;t remember what it means.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents rant.<br/>

Oh, I read that in the bookstore, and that cracked me up. I think it&#39;s <br/>
SUPPOSED to be funny, not dumbed down, that he does that.<br/>
