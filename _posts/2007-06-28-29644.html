<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIJtKxdRQzY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIJtKxdRQzY</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIJtKxdRQzY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIJtKxdRQzY</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;OK, that was amazing.  Even before the end I was impressed by <br/>
&gt;his ability to paint upside down and from different <br/>
&gt;perspectives.  It&#39;s not an ability I currently have!  I know there <br/>
&gt;are exercises you can do to help with this.  I think there&#39;s <br/>
&gt;probably a lot of linearity (I guess that&#39;s a word...) I&#39;d have to <br/>
&gt;unlearn.  This ties in with unschooling for me.  I remember hearing <br/>
&gt;someone speak about how one of her sons who was very artistic didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;read until age 14 or so.  She believed that because of his art, he <br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t ready to look at a page in a right side up, linear, left to <br/>
&gt;right manner until that age.  I think it probably worked in reverse <br/>
&gt;for me!  As soon as I learned to identify letters at 3 or 4, I <br/>
&gt;probably lost my ability to see the world just as easily upside down <br/>
&gt;and backwards as &quot;right side up.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(and to this group):  I have a little list in my head - maybe <br/>
somebody&#39;s written it down somewhere?- of what we give up, <br/>
individually and as a culture, with our focus on early <br/>
literacy.  This is one of those things, I think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting idea. I&#39;m not sure when I became aware of it, (maybe  <br/>
11-13 ish?) but my ability to write upsidedown, backwards (you can read it in <br/>
a  mirror) and upsidedown *and* backwards seemed to improve with my <br/>
writing/reading  ability... but maybe that doesn&#39;t count because its actual writing and <br/>
not &quot;the  world&quot;... I&#39;m not sure, but it sure is something I&#39;m going to read <br/>
more about  and share with my kids! Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I was 13 when I learned to write backwards to amuse myself in class.   <br/>
It wasn&#39;t a natural thing I was doing already, though.  And because I  <br/>
learned it and practiced it (lots) the way I did, when I write  <br/>
backwards now it&#39;s my 8th grade cursive handwriting, a hand I haven&#39;t  <br/>
used since high school.  That&#39;s kinda fun.<br/>
<br/>
I used to write out song lyrics for my friends and they would put  <br/>
them up in windows at their houses so they could read them &quot;the right  <br/>
way&quot; (so the light could shine through the paper and make it legible).<br/>
<br/>
Some people can hear music backwards or speak backwards or recite  <br/>
strings of numbers backwards or say the alphabet backwards without  <br/>
learning it painstakingly, so it&#39;s not just the the visual area that  <br/>
some people have that odd ability to see from other angles.<br/>
