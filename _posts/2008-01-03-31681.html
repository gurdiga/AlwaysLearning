<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406564222">Hi Unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself in the group, since I just<br/>
recently joined. My interest in unschooling began sometime in the 8th<br/>
grade or the latter parts of 9th grade. Reading The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook was a real eye opening experience for me! It helped that I<br/>
was also becoming interested in political theory that was skeptical of<br/>
the desirability of rigid authority and power structures.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I won&#39;t go into that here, because I saw Sandra Dodd ask that<br/>
political discussion be excluded from the list. If anyone wants to<br/>
contact me privately about political issues related to education, than<br/>
they can email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:chessanarch@...">chessanarch@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the unschooling chat (    :<br/>
<br/>
I ended up dropping out of high school, and I got my GED in November<br/>
of 2004. I am 20 now, and I&#39;ve completed three semesters of college. I<br/>
had two classes in the first two, and I completed three this last<br/>
semester. I have all A&#39;s and B&#39;s, except for two D&#39;s during a semester<br/>
I was really depressed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, listening to the lectures is interesting, and I do enjoy<br/>
one on one interaction with a professor here or there, but I really<br/>
dislike the grading/stamp of approval aspects of it. I don&#39;t mind<br/>
getting feedback on projects I undertake in life, but I feel that<br/>
letter grades don&#39;t tell anything substantive, except that I did or<br/>
didn&#39;t do what was of asked me to a certain extent.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that so much of the world seems stuck on people being<br/>
able to show they&#39;ve been a cog in the machine, or jumped through<br/>
certain hoops whether or not they really wanted to. I feel that I<br/>
could acquire knowledge and skills on my own in an intelligent fashion<br/>
that should make me attractive to an employer or customer who values<br/>
independence, creativity, and intelligence. I have high medical costs,<br/>
so I need a way to afford health insurance, and I know that a<br/>
professional job usually has that. I am also planning on leaving the<br/>
United States and wonder about how immigration authorities in New<br/>
Zealand will look upon me.<br/>
<br/>
What I am curious about is non-collegiate paths that lead to a fairly<br/>
decent income, and if anyone has had the experience of successfully<br/>
getting an enjoyable job based on an unschooling collegiate portfolio.<br/>
Also, if anyone knows about charities that pay for healthcare costs,<br/>
than that would be helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

events and excursions for people with developmental disabilities -  <br/>

staying up as late as he wanted and going to bed when he needed to.<br/>

people start making choices toward the goal (college, money) instead  <br/>
of doing the interesting things to learn the unusual things that will  <br/>
eventually lead them to people and places where they will be welcomed  <br/>
and appreciated for what they have learned naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your life and your child&#39;s life busy and rich with real-world  <br/>
experiences and activities.  Get them cameras or leatherworking kits  <br/>
if they want them.  Don&#39;t be stingy about helping them attend a  <br/>
conference or a camp where they&#39;ll meet other people interested in  <br/>
what they&#39;re interested in.  If they&#39;re playing Rock Band, spring for  <br/>
some extra songs and another guitar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so true. Even when she took some classes at our local  <br/>
community college, she took them for their own sake, and just took  <br/>
what really excited her. She wasn&#39;t taking them to fulfill college  <br/>
requirements or anything like that. She took voice classes and  <br/>
ceramics classes and photography and so on. We used them in the same  <br/>
way others went to a dance studio or karate studio, etc. Not as &quot;going  <br/>
to college.&quot; As she got up into usual college age, maybe 19 or 20, she  <br/>
decided she wanted to get a degree and only then did she even look at  <br/>
what the requirements were.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I recommend, &quot;The Uncollege Alternative,&quot; especially as  <br/>
inspiration for those who feel uncomfortable about not being on some  <br/>
sort of college-prep path. As a college professor, I&#39;m really firmly  <br/>
convinced that most young adults would benefit much much more from  <br/>
college, anyway, if they would go off and do things other than college  <br/>
at least for a while, first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi, i really agree with this. my eldest daughter finished highschool here in italy 2 years <br/>
ago.. (my older children went the school route as we did not know we could be &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>
(un) at home.what is she doing now? making money doing what she has always loved <br/>
doing...messing about with yarns and colours.<br/>
<br/>
this summer she and i started an on line business sellling our weaving --of course me <br/>
have 7 children means she is the main arm of the endeavor, and I am the net and support.<br/>
<br/>
my ds3 who is 13 and I am really encouraging him to let go of highschool, yet there is so <br/>
much fear...<br/>
anyway, he is always busy with his drums and crafting up stuff to support our weaving--<br/>
right now he is immersed in inventing a spinning wheel from an old singer pedal <br/>
machine...<br/>
<br/>
dh never did the school route after 8th grade, and followed his passions.  at first it was <br/>
just traveling, then he discovered music and followed his ear--he never did formal <br/>
training though he studies under a master musician, still today.  He was offered a position <br/>
to teach his specialty in a University course at a music conservatory here in italy in 2000.  <br/>
Hes still there, and no degree, though all his collegues are highly degreed and stralunati <br/>
because they had music shoved down there throats since they can remember.<br/>
<br/>
he started music at 22 years of age.<br/>
hes 50 now and supports a family of 9 and we have a farm and a lovely life.<br/>
not rich but richly living.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know if this testamony supports unschooling or not...but for me it just goes to <br/>
prove that school is more of a scam and hindrance than a help to live a meaningful life..<br/>
my children have been lucky that school in italy is only half days, home by lunchtime even <br/>
thru highschool.  so it hasnt interfered as much as it did in my life...plus our unschooly <br/>
approach twoards life made a big difference, im sure.<br/>
<br/>
my dad always told me just do what you love...I could never decide what I loved cause the <br/>
school was always there telling me to do this or that.  <br/>
<br/>
Im still figurring it out (er maybe children and mindful living are my love??)<br/>
<br/>
anyway. <br/>
melissa<br/>
in italy<br/>
mamma of 7 <br/>
2 years thru 20<br/>
all unschooled til 6 years and now dd5 is paving the way for unschooled for life (i hope!)</div>

     If you don&#39;t mind my asking, how is it that you&#39;ve come to live in Italy?  I am wondering because we are exploring the idea of trying to live for some amount of time in another country.  Thanks,<br/>

off and write... (didnt light the wood burner today)<br/>
<br/>
when I was attending Umass, I met this really interesting student who just took the classes <br/>
that interested her. <br/>
<br/>
She didnt worry about enrollment, as she was auditing.<br/>
she didnt worry about grades, as she was auditing AND since she was only taking the <br/>
classes she was interested in, her results were phenomenal. <br/>
<br/>
she was doing what my dad was telling me to do. <br/>

//If you don&#39;t mind my asking, how is it that you&#39;ve come to live in  <br/>

<br/>
I sure dont mind you asking, but Im a little worried it wont be  <br/>
interesting to anybody ...<br/>
like I said, I left Umass in dec of 1985, to visit an ex boyfriend in  <br/>
Paris for 2 weeks over xmas vacation.  He convinced me to go with him  <br/>
to barcelona and so I extended my visit for one more week...we got  <br/>
there and I never went back home.  ex became exed again, met lorenzo  <br/>
my true love lol...he gave me a silver flute to play and we started  <br/>
basking around europe, to save money to go to africa...we never did  <br/>
go to africa and went around the world thru india orient/japan/ <br/>
hawaii...having dd1 lucia along the way in tokyo...we kept traveling  <br/>
until ending back in italy where lorenzo is from in 1990.<br/>
<br/>
so it was round about but mainly due tothe fact that lorenzo is from  <br/>
italy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you mean &quot;busking.&quot;  Not that basking around Europe doesn&#39;t  <br/>
sound like fun, but I can&#39;t see why a flute would be necessary &lt;g&gt;  My  <br/>
sister and her then-husband did that in the &#39;70&#39;s, partly because the  <br/>
airline they&#39;d taken to get there went out of business and stranded  <br/>
them!<br/>
