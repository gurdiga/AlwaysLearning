<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;I always carry homeopathic Arnica Montana 30C with me to the ice <br/>
arena, and a bottle of Arnica spray, as well as Arnica gel for <br/>
topical application.  We apply the spray if the injury is too sore to <br/>
touch, and the gel if we can touch it, and she takes the Arnica 30C <br/>
internally, as often as one pellet every 15 minutes when the pain is <br/>
severe.  And we ice the injury with a bag of crushed ice.  As the <br/>
pain lessens we take the Arnica 30C pellets less and less frequently <br/>
until she doesn&#39;t need them, or needs them only a couple of times a <br/>
day as the healing progresses.  <br/>
<br/>
For sprains and strains we additionally use Ruta Graveolens 30C.  And <br/>
for injuries to areas rich in nerves, like finger, toes, elbows or <br/>
tailbones, we use Hypericum 30C and Hypericum spray. &quot;<br/>
