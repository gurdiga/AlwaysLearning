<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863266277">I&#39;m curious what the members of this list think about the research that has been done that shows that children aren&#39;t physically capable of true logic and reasoning until the age of 7.  In otherwords, that the reasoning part of their brain hasn&#39;t developed yet.  Do you believe it?  How does it affect how you interact with your little ones?  How do you handle situations where your child making X choice would mean disaster for something major (like your work), and they don&#39;t understand the issues involved or the high stakes?  Does it affect whether or not you coerce them?  I have more specific questions that I&#39;ll ask later.  <br/>

Regardless of the research results, the research is trying to explain  <br/>
behavior that existed before the research. The research didn&#39;t cause  <br/>
children under 7 to suddenly become illogical ;-) They&#39;re still the  <br/>
same as they were before the research.<br/>
<br/>
You interact with kids based on how they respond. If they&#39;re not  <br/>
getting what you&#39;re trying to explain, you adjust. They grow. You go  <br/>
with the flow.<br/>

decisions that are safe or sound. Don&#39;t set them up to fail.<br/>
<br/>
An 18 mo may be physically capable of walking into the street but  <br/>
they aren&#39;t capable of reasoning about safety so you don&#39;t let them  <br/>
wander into the street. You redirect. You take them to parks where  <br/>
they can&#39;t wander into the street.<br/>

<br/>
This seems to suggest that you think parents sit way back and wait  <br/>
for a young child to make a choice, and let the choice play out, and  <br/>
then it&#39;s the parent&#39;s move.  Like some destructive chess game.<br/>

Because I don&#39;t understand what you might be thinking, please give an  <br/>
example of how a young child&#39;s choice or action could involve  <br/>
disasterous high stakes.<br/>
<br/>
I never needed to coerce my kids.  I&#39;d persuade and reason and make  <br/>
deals, I&#39;d lure and joke and hug and carry.  Sometimes they didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to go somewhere and I&#39;d carry them out and figure out ways to  <br/>
make it up to them, cheer them up, get them interested in what was  <br/>
going on.<br/>

Give examples, please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223531277">Thanks Joyce! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If you&#39;d never seen the research, how would you interact with your <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pre-7 yo? Just do that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if I had never read that (and other things about age <br/>
appropriate expectations) I&#39;d still be expecting my almost 3 year old <br/>
to be way more logical than she&#39;s capable of and getting frustrated <br/>
with her for not understanding, after the 300th time, why XYZ isn&#39;t <br/>
safe.  Reading those kinds of things helped me to have more <br/>
appropriate expectations.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I would say no to the coercion but that doesn&#39;t really explain <br/>
anything. Specific questions will help clarify the philosophy. Then <br/>
you can see it in action.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, here I am understanding that my almost 3 year old isn&#39;t <br/>
physically capable of logic, but also trying to unschool and have her <br/>
be in charge of her own body, time etc.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re at the park and we need to leave so I can get back home (I work <br/>
from home) for an appointment.  She&#39;s not ready to leave.  I took <br/>
extra time for this possiblity, explained why I needed to get home, <br/>
tried to make the transition slowly.  Now, it&#39;s crunch time, I&#39;ve got <br/>
to get back, I pick her up and put her in the car.  I respected her <br/>
need to go to the park, we stayed for longer than I would have liked, <br/>
I explained the reason that we needed to leave, so it feels like a <br/>
compromise.  But of course, it&#39;s not really a compromise unless both <br/>
parties agree.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But how can she be expected to come to any kind of agreement when she <br/>
is not physically capable of empathy or logic?  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand time, what an appointment is, why it&#39;s important, how the <br/>
appointment is part of my job and if I lose my job we&#39;ll not only be <br/>
unemployed but also homeless.  That&#39;s way too much to put on a kid <br/>
even if she was capable of understanding it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now, I know that you might be thinking that a lot of people would use <br/>
this as an excuse to control everything in their kids lives.  Please <br/>
understand, that is not where I&#39;m coming from.  I don&#39;t control her <br/>
sleep, food, interests, learning to let go of tv.  I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
her anything.  I don&#39;t make her do chores, hover over her play, or <br/>
judge her likes and dislikes.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Everything I read about unschooling is about older kids.  How do you <br/>
have no coersion and kids being in control of their own bodies, while <br/>
still getting your needs met (when they really are needs that have to <br/>
be met for the benefit of the whole family)?  Especially when they <br/>
are little.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754692880">-=-Honestly, if I had never read that (and other things about age<br/>

appropriate expectations.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good point.  Some of the treatment of babies and small  <br/>
children is pretty awful.  I saw my mom swat my baby half brother,  <br/>
when I was 19, 20.  And she said he understood her perfectly well,  <br/>
when she was telling him (at less than a year old) to stop doing  <br/>
whatever (like peeing, or reaching for things).<br/>
<br/>
I tend to assume that everyone who&#39;s ever had a baby has read books  <br/>
about child development.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, here I am understanding that my almost 3 year old isn&#39;t  <br/>
physically capable of logic, but also trying to unschool and have her  <br/>
be in charge of her own body, time etc. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please, PLEASE tell me where in the world or on the internet you got  <br/>
the idea that a two year old should be &quot;in charge&quot; of anything.   <br/>
Please.  The instances of people coming to this list for us to  <br/>
&quot;explain&quot; things that never came from this list are increasing, and  <br/>
I&#39;m brave enough to go to the people who are giving bad information  <br/>
and ask them to stop it.   If you read on my site that a baby (or  <br/>
anyone) should be &quot;in charge&quot; of something, please let me know where  <br/>
and I&#39;ll go and change it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That&#39;s way too much to put on a kid even if she was capable of  <br/>
understanding it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Make leaving more fun than staying.  Take her for a little walk away  <br/>
from the other kids and stuff, and sing to her, show her birds, talk  <br/>
about something cool that&#39;s going to happen later.  Swing her  <br/>
around.  Get her laughing.  Get YOU laughing.  Be a person she thinks  <br/>
is more interesting that swings or sandboxes or whatever.  Bring her  <br/>
back the  next day, or later that night.  Parks are nice in the dark,  <br/>
in the summer, especially.<br/>
<br/>
Find more choices in your life, the huge range between waiting until  <br/>
she&#39;s ready to go and missing an appointment.  HUGE range.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t control her sleep, food, interests, learning to let go of  <br/>
tv. I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; her anything. I don&#39;t make her do chores, hover  <br/>

<br/>
What kind of chores would a two year old be doing anyway?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everything I read about unschooling is about older kids. How do  <br/>
you have no coersion and kids being in control of their own bodies,  <br/>
while still getting your needs met (when they really are needs that  <br/>
have to be met for the benefit of the whole family)? Especially when  <br/>
they are little.-=-<br/>
<br/>
About meeting your own needs, if you have an adult partner or another  <br/>
mom who can trade off some time (or hang out in your house with the  <br/>
kids while you take a shower, or outside the place where you have an  <br/>
appointment), and then you do the same for her, that&#39;s a way.  Find a  <br/>
mother&#39;s helper or babysitter, not to keep the child separate from  <br/>
you, but to play with her, read to her, take her outside to play,  <br/>
while you&#39;re doing things nearby enough to help if there&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this...<br/>
<br/>
-=- How do you have no coersion and kids being in control of their  <br/>
own bodies...-=-<br/>
<br/>
This rhetoric doesn&#39;t come from  this list.  Please write to me on  <br/>
the side and tell me where you found it, if you&#39;re not comfortable  <br/>
saying so on the list.  If it&#39;s something you&#39;ve extrapolated or  <br/>
maybe misinterpreted, that&#39;s worth considering, too.<br/>

Looking at a child through any lens other than a clear one is going  <br/>
to get in the way of helping them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reading those kinds of things helped me to have more<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For unschooling and for building relationships, observation of who  <br/>
your child is rather than who you think he is helps. Your son is who  <br/>
he is regardless of what a book says he is. He&#39;s capable of what he  <br/>
shows he&#39;s capable of.<br/>
<br/>
What if you were terrified to speak in public? What if, just because  <br/>
you&#39;re an adult, your husband decided you were a public speaker and  <br/>
volunteered you to speak before the town meeting about homeschooling,  <br/>
how would it help you? How would it affect your relationship with  <br/>
him? What if you told him you were scared? What if you showed him you  <br/>
were scared by throwing up? What if despite everything he could see  <br/>
with his eyes he kept seeing you through the lens of a public  <br/>
speaker? Would his vision, his expectations help you be what you  <br/>
weren&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The park issue has obviously come up a lot. It would be tricky to  <br/>
search for in the archives, but not impossible. &quot;Park&quot; actually might  <br/>
work as a search term. &quot;Playground&quot; too. Oh, &quot;transition&quot; might work.  <br/>
(Which is offered as a suggestion if there aren&#39;t a wealth of ideas  <br/>
that come out.)<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a way to get her to change her wants. Do everything  <br/>
you&#39;re doing to show you do see her need to play as serious. Then  <br/>
sympathize. Empathize. Don&#39;t do the &quot;I&#39;m sorry but ...&quot; That negates  <br/>
the sympathy. Do explain briefly that someone is expecting to meet  <br/>
with you and you like to be on time but do sympathize that you  <br/>
understand she doesn&#39;t want to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Also give yourself more time and leave for something better. Get ice  <br/>
cream before the appointment so *she* has a reason to leave.<br/>

find them, I can&#39;t.  :(  It wasn&#39;t anything I read recently.  Just <br/>
things from an childhood psycology class, links on other parenting <br/>
boards.  I&#39;ll keep looking.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This seems to suggest that you think parents sit way back and wait  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, that&#39;s not what I think.  But I have never been around an <br/>
experienced unschooler and their little kids.  So, I&#39;m trying to <br/>
figure out what it looks like from lists and discussions and essays.  <br/>
And obviously what it looks like for someone else&#39;s family will be <br/>
different from mine, and we have to find our own way.   <br/>
<br/>
IRL I know 3 kinds of parents<br/>
1. Parents who coerce, spank etc.<br/>
2. Parents who practice gentle discipline (no spanking, no timeouts, <br/>
focus on relationship building, understanding age appropriate <br/>
behavior, but still coerce)<br/>
3. Parents who practice non-coercive parenting and watch as their <br/>
kids damage people, hurt things and do whatever their kid wants as <br/>
they brag about how the respect their child&#39;s need to throw food at <br/>
the waiter or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Someone on another board I&#39;m on brought up an interesting idea- <br/>
unschooling vs. unparenting.  Similar to the unschooling vs. not-<br/>
schooling that was brought up here recently.  Maybe this is what I&#39;m <br/>
getting at.  People call unschoolers permissive because we &quot;let our <br/>
kids do whatever they want.&quot; But that&#39;s not it.  I would call <br/>
permissive what I described in #3 above. I don&#39;t want to be that <br/>
parent.  I don&#39;t want to &quot;unparent.&quot;  I don&#39;t think most <br/>
unschooers &quot;unparent,&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to coerce.  So, I&#39;m <br/>
trying to learn how to find that balance.  And I think the key is <br/>
connection.  I&#39;m just trying to find my way, I guess.  Putting belief <br/>
into practice.  And I&#39;m probably not making any sense.</div>

I&#39;m not quoting anything from your site or asking you to explain <br/>
anything from another source.  I&#39;m just throwing my ideas out there <br/>
and trying to get the opinion of people who seem to be very involved <br/>
and active with their children, have similar parenting views, and who <br/>
have older children so they&#39;ve been there, done that.  <br/>
<br/>
By &quot;in charge&quot; I mean in control of her own body, her own space, her <br/>
own mind, her time.  So, for things like sleep and food etc., that&#39;s <br/>
easy for me to accomodate.  But, naturally, I don&#39;t want her &quot;in <br/>

compromise, find creative solutions, and get everyone&#39;s needs met.   <br/>

about 20 minutes before we had to leave, I gave her a heads up that <br/>
we needed to take a sweatshirt to her daddy who was at work.  We were <br/>
playing tag, so I slowly worked the game over to the car.  She had <br/>
fun chasing me to the car, we piled in all laughs and smiles, with me <br/>
getting her a snack.  This might seem like an easy thing for some of <br/>
you.  For me, it&#39;s big!  I&#39;m not playful at all normally, and never <br/>
was as a kid.  So, I&#39;m having to *learn* how to be playful and <br/>
engaging and interesting.  Fortunatley, my daughter doesn&#39;t judge my <br/>
clumsy attempts like an adult would. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t noncoercive parenting. Our highest priority is not  <br/>
&quot;not coercing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That said, coercion isn&#39;t a good way to build good relationships and  <br/>
it isn&#39;t a good way to support happy learning lives.<br/>
<br/>
Coercion doesn&#39;t feel good and it can result in angry resistance or  <br/>
&quot;its-no-use-resisting&quot; apathy. Either way, it tends to block learning.  <br/>
So, we try to avoid it. Still, sometimes we coerce.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t talk about &quot;teaching&quot; because we know that teaching is not  <br/>
the same as helping our kids learn.<br/>
We don&#39;t talk about &quot;not coercing,&quot; because &quot;not coercing&quot; isn&#39;t the  <br/>
same as helping our kids develop good character.<br/>
<br/>
When your little child is kicking you, please do coerce him into not  <br/>
doing that. If he&#39;s kicking or hitting or biting or pinching another  <br/>
child, please do coerce him into not doing that. If he&#39;s running into  <br/>
the street, go ahead and coerce him into not doing that. If he&#39;s  <br/>
throwing rocks at your dog, please.....<br/>
<br/>
When you do coerce, try to do it with the least physical force and the  <br/>
least embarrassment to the child as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you can use distraction, that&#39;s often the best option and becoming  <br/>
skilled at that is great.<br/>
<br/>
When these situations arise - try to figure out why and how to prevent  <br/>
them in the future. Plan ahead. Be more attentive. Run through  <br/>
possible scenarios in your head. Change the environment.<br/>
<br/>
Do not withhold useful information from the child. It has to be in  <br/>
terms your own child can grasp, so we can&#39;t tell you exactly what to  <br/>
say or do, but you should be aware of what information/message your  <br/>
child is getting. If your child is kicking you and you pretend not to  <br/>
notice and keep talking to him about what he wants, what are you  <br/>
helping him learn?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if your child is kicking you, you should think about what needs  <br/>
of his are not being met. But, in the meantime, while you&#39;re figuring  <br/>
that out, stop him from kicking you even if that requires coercion.  <br/>
You might say something like, &quot;I want to help you, but kicking me is  <br/>
not okay!&quot;  Make him stop, work on what he is wanting, and follow up  <br/>
by saying, &quot;Next time, no kicking, talk to me instead, okay?&quot; (Again,  <br/>
you have to adjust the wording to your child&#39;s nature and ability to  <br/>
comprehend.)<br/>
<br/>
If we were perfect at planning ahead; if we always were well rested,  <br/>
well fed, healthy; if there were no allergies or hormones or irritants  <br/>
in our lives; if there were no unreasonable bosses or landlords or  <br/>
relatives - if if if if - then maybe we could design our lives so that  <br/>
we&#39;d never end up coercing our children.<br/>
<br/>
This is why it is so great to get clear what your priorities in life  <br/>
really are - is it not coercing no matter what?<br/>

<br/>

  authoritarian parenting is based on fear - the child&#39;s fear of losing the parent&#39;s love and approval<br/>
<br/>
  permissive parenting is based on fear - the parents&#39; fear of losing the child&#39;s love and approval<br/>
<br/>
  connection parenting is NOT based on fear.  it&#39;s based on the primacy of connection between parent and child.<br/>

<br/>
I know that the &quot;TCS&quot; (&quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot;) definition of  <br/>
coercion would cover those example above, but in English without  <br/>
jargon, I don&#39;t think those things are coercion at all.<br/>
<br/>
When a child is kicking, if I pick him up so he can&#39;t kick, or if I  <br/>
stand between him and the object of kicking (if I&#39;m not the kickee  <br/>
myself), that&#39;s prevention or stopping him.  I&#39;m not &quot;coercing.&quot;  I&#39;m  <br/>
acting directly to cause kicking to cease.  Not indirectly by  <br/>
spanking or threatening, but physically breaking the connection one  <br/>
way or another.  I might hold his leg or turn him around or yell  <br/>
sharply so he is stunned for a second and I can talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s kicking or hitting or biting or pinching, I have no time for  <br/>
the subtleties of coercion.  I will protect the other child (or dog  <br/>
or cat) right then, for the good of everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
I could prevent a child from going into the street with words or  <br/>
physical restraint.  That is not, in plain English usage, &quot;coercion.&quot;<br/>

Parenting stuff. They mean the use of force, constraint, control of  <br/>
any kind - not just physical, either.<br/>

I&#39;m not really sure what the plain English usage would be - the  <br/>

But anyway - I used the word &quot;coerce&quot; over and over to make the point  <br/>
that we are not promoting the same parenting style as &quot;Taking Children  <br/>
Seriously&quot;/Noncoercive Parenting which I personally spent a year or  <br/>
two investigating and considering and came to the conclusion that it  <br/>
didn&#39;t support helping children develop some of the character traits  <br/>
that I think are important.<br/>

the car, if you would&#39;ve bossed and demanded for your child to comply,<br/>
and you both would&#39;ve been unhappy.  Or you could&#39;ve physically picked<br/>
her up, screaming and crying, and quickly gotten to the car, which is<br/>
what a lot of parents do with little kids, simply because they can.  The<br/>
thing is, once they are too big for that, you&#39;ve already set the<br/>
precedence for leaving=negative experience.<br/>
<br/>
So, the more you do what you wrote above, the easier and easier it will<br/>
be and the more pleasant it will be as your child gets older and<br/>
associates leaving with other different than whatever they were doing,<br/>

<br/>
Probably, and when they expand their definition of &quot;coercive&quot; to  <br/>
include anything done that&#39;s not at the child&#39;s insistence (which is  <br/>
a crazy definition), and then people ask whether I&#39;m coercive or non- <br/>
coercive, there&#39;s a point where they want one word and I have 500 words.<br/>
<br/>
Coercion is sneaky or cheatery or involves threats.  Straightforward  <br/>
conversation isn&#39;t coercion.  Treating children as I treat my adult  <br/>
friends isn&#39;t coercion.  Blackmail and extortion are the big end of  <br/>
coercion.  Using unfair arguments like doctors so often do (do you  <br/>
want to take these shots or would you rather die?) is coercion.   <br/>
Oversimplifying a situation so that there are two choices but they&#39;re  <br/>
not really the only two nor even maybe sensible choices is coercion.<br/>
<br/>
The way this list has talked about choices (choices parents make,  <br/>
choices kids make) isn&#39;t coercion, and neither is it by &quot;TCS&quot;  <br/>
definition &quot;non coercion.&quot;  But I don&#39;t have any reason to think that  <br/>
their pure philosophy works well, and I have a flood of evidence that  <br/>
discovering or creating a large range of choices and deciding in each  <br/>
moment what to do and why is like another world from the same-old  <br/>
rules and threats of mainstream parenting.<br/>

in a society like that.  Where people were able to treat their <br/>
children with respect without thinking about it.  Where it wasn&#39;t <br/>
a &quot;parenting method&quot; but a way of life.  It also works because they <br/>
have a tribe, a community, and very little to no contact with outside <br/>
influences, and certainly no one who is telling them a different way <br/>
to parent.  Their whole culture is different, and we just can&#39;t mimic <br/>
that here.  <br/>
<br/>

and good for you for being able to take some advice, find your own way with it and use it <br/>
immediately for the better of your lives.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was two and I realized that I had a being with his own ideas about things <br/>
that didn&#39;t always match mine (understatement--LOL) I read the positive discipline books.  <br/>
They recommended giving choices.  I interpreted that advice to mean that he should get to <br/>
choose everything, because the more choices the better, right?  Very quickly I had him so <br/>
freaked out and anxious with choices that life because miserable, and I would wait until <br/>
he&#39;d chosen, which could take awhile since he was like a deer in the headlights.<br/>
<br/>
He isn&#39;t someone who likes to have choice in the details, only the big picture.  My <br/>
daughter is completely different, but I didn&#39;t know enough then about how to connect with <br/>
a 2 yo to know that some children don&#39;t give a fig about which socks they put on and <br/>
some do.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, you have to develop a feel for what works for YOUR child--not the <br/>
hypothetical one, but the one if front of you.  For those of us who didn&#39;t feel like we had <br/>
any instinct from which to draw, it takes practice. lol<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been lurking on this list for over a month.  I have read Teach Your Own, An <br/>
Uncshooled Life, and the Unschooling Handbook.  I am unschooling my three children.  <br/>
Many posts to this list have been very helpful to me.  I am trying to interalize the <br/>
principles of unschooling.  I am finding myself confused by the overlap in different <br/>
philosophies.  <br/>
<br/>
After reading the posts on TCS/ non coercive parenting, I realize that I am a little mixed <br/>
up about where unschooling ends and TCS begins.  Labels like permissiveness, radical <br/>
unschooling, connection parenting have me a little confused.  Could I get some more <br/>
clarification how these different labels relate to pure and simple unschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
On what interpersonal issues does an unschooling (but not TCS) parent intervene?  I had <br/>
an experience early on with a park day group that left me uncertain about this.  We were <br/>
new to the group, and my daughter asked the group of girls at the park day if she could <br/>
play with them.  They replied that they did not want to play with her (they were not rude, <br/>
just engaged with the group that had always played with).  <br/>
<br/>
After a couple of weeks of the same response, I metioned it to one of the mothers, hoping <br/>
she might help me find a way to ease the transition (as we were new to the group, and my <br/>
daughter was interested in playing with the group).  She replied that she would not try to <br/>
change her daughter in any way.  She said it was her daughters time at the park, and she <br/>
only plays with people that interest her.  She asked if I would force my child to play with <br/>
someone she didn&#39;t want to play with.  (Of course, I would not - but I didn&#39;t see that as the <br/>
only option.) <br/>
<br/>
We have attended this park day a few more times, and my daughter has never been <br/>
allowed to play with the group of girls her age.  She usually plays on her own, or hangs out <br/>
with me and the baby.  Often we do not attend at all.  <br/>
<br/>
-&gt;but I don&#39;t have any reason to think that <br/>
-&gt;their pure philosophy works well, and I have a flood of evidence that <br/>
-&gt;discovering or creating a large range of choices and deciding in each <br/>
-&gt;moment what to do and why is like another world from the same-old <br/>
-&gt;rules and threats of mainstream parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the quote above leaves me wondering that if TCS offers a huge range of choices <br/>
moment to moment, how does that differ from an unschoolers philosophy on choices.  <br/>

Staci--<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t say whether this park day group is made up of unschoolers, TCS people, or <br/>
neither, so clarification might be helpful for context, maybe not.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m involved with a large unschooler&#39;s group about an hour away and have helped <br/>
start one locally, and it has always been my experience that the parents are very proactive <br/>
in helping new people integrate into the established social fabric.  It can be just as difficult <br/>
for the moms as it is for the children.  lol  <br/>
<br/>
The question that springs to my mind is how would that woman&#39;s daughter know if she <br/>
was interested in your daughter or not if she hasn&#39;t really noticed her and played some <br/>
with her.  That&#39;s where the area gets a little gray in some peoples&#39; minds, I guess.  In my <br/>
opinion, it is to everyone&#39;s benefit to help a new playmate join in.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that child won&#39;t ultimately fit in, but I think that my daughter&#39;s life may be <br/>
enhanced by the opportunities that a new person brings, so I do believe it is in her <br/>
interest to give a new playmate a chance, so I help her find ways to invite a new child in.  <br/>
She is almost always receptive to someone new when I point out that someone would like <br/>
to join her and her friends.  She often simply will not notice if I don&#39;t point it out.  I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine a group of adults who are so limited in their thinking.  Maybe there&#39;s a warmer <br/>
group out there that you haven&#39;t found yet.<br/>
<br/>
That seems like an example of trying to apply a rule/idea to your life that may have <br/>
worked for someone else, but isn&#39;t very useful.<br/>
<br/>
If I make the worst assumption about that group of girls--that they are excluding your <br/>
daughter consistently on purpose--then I think it&#39;s a little evil that their parents are not <br/>
intervening.  They can call it what they will, but in my mind they are feeding into a lot of <br/>
the kind of thinking that we want to help our children get beyond.  There is a tie-in here <br/>
for me with the other discussion about brain development.  Perfect example of parents <br/>
NOT helping their children use their higher brain functions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991781503">-=-I read the positive discipline books.<br/>
They recommended giving choices. I interpreted that advice to mean  <br/>
that he should get to<br/>
choose everything, because the more choices the better, right? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes!  If you say &quot;What do you want to eat in the whole world&quot; it&#39;s  <br/>
a hard question, but if you say &quot;Do you want peanut butter or grilled  <br/>
cheese?&quot; then it&#39;s fun and easy.  Especially if they can say &quot;I want  <br/>
mashed potatoes.&quot;    If you say &quot;Which jacket do you want to wear?&quot;  <br/>
it&#39;s still a choice.  &quot;Do you want to wear a jacket or not&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>
nearly as good a choice, if it&#39;s very cold.  But that kind of  <br/>
misinterpretation wastes a lot of people&#39;s time and energy, and  <br/>
unschoolers get accused of this or that when we say &quot;Why didn&#39;t you  <br/>
make sure he was wearing a jacket?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And someone will say &quot;Well you told me to give him a choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
eeek.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a big to-do over this very subject on a local list. A mom wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For example, if my daughter starts to leave the house without a coat<br/>
(and I think it would be advisable due to the weather) I will give<br/>
her a weather report, i.e., it is supposed to rain today, perhaps a<br/>
coat would be good? If she still chooses no coat, then I respect<br/>
her choice. Or if she gets cold, I don&#39;t go out of my way to change<br/>
my plans and go home for a coat. The logical consequences of not<br/>
choosing to bring a coat is being cold.  <br/>
<br/>
If she demands that I return for her coat, and I give into her, then<br/>
I am allowing her to disrespect my needs (to get the doctor&#39;s on<br/>
time, for example.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt it was more &quot;teach her a lesson&quot; than &quot;respecting her child&#39;s choice.&quot; I suggested, as did only one other person, that she could have brought a coat for her kid, in case she changed her mind. Then, her daughter would have discovered that her mother was thinking about her needs, in advance of them. That would have been a nice thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also had another long-time unschooler (who is a friend) say that her child would have been mortified if she&#39;d brought a coat for him, when he&#39;d made a decision not to wear one. He would always pack his own stuff and was independent from early on, I gather. <br/>
<br/>
My dd, on the other hand, preferred to depend on me to pick up the slack, in case she made an error in judgment. I kind of thought that was my job as *her* mother, but I didn&#39;t respond. By the time I&#39;d thought of it, we&#39;d gotten to the &quot;tea party&quot; stage of &quot;whatever you do is just fine - it&#39;s all unschooling.&quot; I stopped posting then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914997156"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thinking a bit more about what I said about my dd depending on me in a  <br/>
way that other kids might not, I realize it sort of flows into a older  <br/>
reply in my drafts folder. I think the principle of being a child&#39;s  <br/>
partner in the ways that meets *that child&#39;s* needs best was what I  <br/>
was hoping to further discuss on that other list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For unschooling and for building relationships, observation of who<br/>
&gt; your child is rather than who you think he is helps. Your son is who<br/>
&gt; he is regardless of what a book says he is. He&#39;s capable of what he<br/>
&gt; shows he&#39;s capable of.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is important for me to remember whenever I see a  <br/>
description of how almost-14-year-old girls are, including (and maybe  <br/>
especially) unschooled girls. My dd rarely fits into the &quot;mature, self- <br/>
confident, open-minded, easy to discuss personal/sexual matters with,  <br/>
thrilled to play with little kids&quot; mold that sometimes seems like the  <br/>
norm. She&#39;s actually more like a 9-year-old boy, if I were to compare  <br/>
her!<br/>
<br/>
But, as one of my first unschooling mentors wrote, &quot;Comparisons are  <br/>
odious.&quot; So, it is really important to look at who my dd *is*, and not  <br/>
seeing her as &quot;wanting&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;incapable.&quot; And, it&#39;s obvious to  <br/>
her that she doesn&#39;t fit in with most girls (or boys) her age and she  <br/>
has said as much, sometimes tearfully, to me. She declares herself  <br/>
&quot;weird&quot; and alternates between being proud of that and a bit sad about  <br/>
it. Mostly proud &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I hardly need to point out differences to her by having expectations  <br/>
of what level of maturity she &quot;ought&quot; to be at. She knows by observing  <br/>
that it&#39;s just not how she is. That doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t talk about  <br/>
what others might expect of a 13-year-old, or that she doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
know, but I must be her partner in helping her understand and  <br/>
negotiate some situations because she isn&#39;t at that stage yet to do it  <br/>
herself. And it feels a bit more complicated these days than it used to.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I enjoy who she is *right now*. She&#39;s pretty darn  <br/>
cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484318813">-=- I am finding myself confused by the overlap in different<br/>
philosophies. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I brought the statement above out from the bottom of the paragraph  <br/>
below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have been lurking on this list for over a month. I have read  <br/>
Teach Your Own, An<br/>
Uncshooled Life, and the Unschooling Handbook. I am unschooling my  <br/>
three children.<br/>
Many posts to this list have been very helpful to me. I am trying to  <br/>
interalize the<br/>
principles of unschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is your middle book above Rue Kream&#39;s &quot;Parenting a Free Child:  An  <br/>
Unschooled Life&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If so, that&#39;s the best match for the unschooling discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s principles are fantastic and changed my life, but he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a parent, and so much of what we&#39;ve come to know about things  <br/>
like bedtimes and chores and food are kind of a melding of the John  <br/>
Holt stuff and attachment parenting, which many learned from La Leche  <br/>
League and others learned other ways, and then expanding on those.   <br/>
Attachment parenting is about infancy, but if the principles can be  <br/>
stretched on out, without school putting the brakes on, then you come  <br/>
to this place of radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith&#39;s Unschooling Handbook is more toward academics.<br/>
<br/>
I think those three have complementary information and not much  <br/>
conflict, if any, but Rue&#39;s book has quotes and ideas from people on  <br/>
this list and others related.<br/>
<br/>
-=-After reading the posts on TCS/ non coercive parenting, I realize  <br/>
that I am a little mixed  up about where unschooling ends and TCS  <br/>
begins.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I see them as quite separate.  TCS isn&#39;t of interest to me, and it&#39;s  <br/>
irritating because just as with so many other self-chosen labels,  <br/>
there&#39;s an implication that they take children seriously and no one  <br/>
else does.<br/>
<br/>

her child would have been mortified if she&#39;d brought a coat for him,  <br/>
when he&#39;d made a decision not to wear one. He would always pack his  <br/>
own stuff and was independent from early on, I gather. -=-<br/>
<br/>
She could&#39;ve stuck one in the trunk of the car without announcing it,  <br/>
and not mention it unless he said &quot;I wish I&#39;d brought a coat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents have obligations that unschooling can&#39;t absolve them of, and  <br/>
taking care of children&#39;s physical needs is one of them.  A parent  <br/>
can&#39;t say to a social worker or a judge &quot;I told him to take a coat,  <br/>
but he didn&#39;t want to,&quot; if they&#39;re saying &quot;It&#39;s too cold for a child  <br/>
to be out without a coat.&quot;  (They can say it, but they will look like  <br/>
idiots or neglectful parents, somewhere in that range.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a license to step off the planet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dd, on the other hand, preferred to depend on me to pick up the  <br/>
slack, in case she made an error in judgment.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I expect the same thing of my husband and my kids.  If it&#39;s cold and  <br/>
I&#39;m spacing out at the door, or we&#39;re leaving in the daylight and  <br/>
it&#39;s going to get dark, SOMEbody in the group should mention it, or  <br/>
grab a handful of coats or say &quot;It will be cold on the way back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sunday  morning Keith (52) and Marty (19) were leaving from a bright,  <br/>
still driveway in Albuquerque, to go to Santa Fe, which is further  <br/>
north and higher in elevation.  I said &quot;Marty, it will be colder in  <br/>
Santa Fe.  It snowed there Friday night.&quot;  So he said &quot;oh!&quot; and went  <br/>
and got a heavy long-sleeved shirt to go over his t-shirt.  Keith  <br/>
already had long sleeves.  He&#39;s older and more experienced.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;make&quot; Marty get a shirt.  I didn&#39;t ask him whether he wanted to get  <br/>
a shirt or not.  I gave him the information he needed.  We&#39;ve never  <br/>
had an antagonistic relationship, so there would&#39;ve been no benefit  <br/>
to him of resisting responding to the information.  It wasn&#39;t one of  <br/>
us winning and one of us losing.<br/>
