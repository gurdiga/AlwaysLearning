<div id="ygrps-yiv-243717200">&lt;&lt;(Kirby) has a mixed bag of genetic potential as to height.  He&#39;s <br/>
5&#39;10&quot; and seems to have stopped.  His dad&#39;s 6&#39;1&quot; but the tallest in his <br/>
family.  But he has a taller uncle and<br/>
I have a couple of tall uncles.  So we have no idea.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And probably best not to guess! Eric&#39;s great uncle had the distinction <br/>
of being the mayor of St. Paul, MN, and the more interesting <br/>
distinction of having been the shortest St. Paul mayor on record. Eric <br/>
is six feet tall, his brother is six feet, four inches.<br/>
<br/>
Go, as they say, figure.<br/>
