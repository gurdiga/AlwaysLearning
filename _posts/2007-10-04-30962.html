<div id="ygrps-yiv-796962636">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I know what you mean. I work in a theatre, and often, if there is an<br/>
issue,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am on the radio asking &quot;house right or stage right&quot;? &gt;&gt;&gt; me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;In Australia this is dealt with by following the English system of Prompt<br/>
and Opposite Prompt (OP). The visiting Americans from touring productions<br/>
were always confused and would always say &quot;OP right&quot; ( ie Stage Right).&quot;<br/>

It is probably a matter of me overthinking it.  A typical situation might<br/>
include a patron messing with some part of the set, climbing on the stage,<br/>
or being in possession  of a camera. (varies)  I work in operations.  The<br/>
stage manager is usually the first to notice it.  The call will come from<br/>
the box, which in physical proximity, is facing the same direction as the<br/>
audience.  But, I would assume that the stage manager would use the same<br/>
directions as the cast and crew, regardless of where the individual is<br/>
physically standing.  This is further complicated by the call coming to me<br/>
through the house manager, who may or may not change it around to fit her<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about the English terms.  That is interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
