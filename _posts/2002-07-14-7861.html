<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000497246">I accidentally sent off the last one, which with that subject line, sounded <br/>
kind of like a threat.... (They&#39;re baaaack....!)<br/>
<br/>
You say you didn&#39;t notice I was gone....that&#39;s okay...<br/>
<br/>
So, I have all these posts backed up, no time to read, and caught up this <br/>
morning. I need to make a point to do that, because I need to hear <br/>
unschooling voices more. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been dealing with a torn-up kitchen (getting new cabinets, etc.), and <br/>
this week, a very sick kitty. Simone is 18 1/2 years old, and suddenly <br/>
stopped being able to walk. Turns out she has a thyroid problem, and she&#39;s <br/>
gaining strength, but still can&#39;t walk and has needed us around pretty much <br/>
constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Julian is almost 13, and it makes me melt just looking at him. He&#39;s so <br/>
beautiful and sweet and smart and funny. MIT offers these enrichment <br/>
programs, classes taught mostly by MIT students, and Julian has signed <br/>
up...He&#39;s taking two courses, two nights a week for five weeks. He LOVES <br/>
this. He loves wandering the campus, and he&#39;s taking pretty intense stuff: a <br/>
biology course (and he loves that he already knows a lot from teaching <br/>
himself) and a course called Refuse and Resist, about Social Activism. My <br/>
little hippy; I&#39;m so proud.  I don&#39;t know if I would have been so <br/>
enthusiastic and comfortable doing this at 12, where most of the kids are <br/>
older, etc. I am in awe of this boy, not for taking classes, but because he <br/>
loves to learn so much.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to put a book proposal together for the spirituality book I&#39;m <br/>
writing, and we&#39;re hoping to actually take some vacation time. It&#39;s probably <br/>
tricky with the sick cat. Send Kitty energy!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be back!<br/>
