<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296365204">I am worried about how I&#39;m going to manage learning nothing. We have an ant colony that has taken up residence in our conservatory (sun room), under the floor tiles. Things have been done to get rid of them, but they are an old and large colony. They are sending out winged ants at the moment for breeding which means that they have been there for at least 3 years. Today I sat on the floor and watched them bring out their dead from the last attempt made to kill them off with boiling water. They aren&#39;t very efficient and are so very fascinating to watch as they piled them up in different areas. Some ants seemed much more rigorous about where they put the dead, how far away. But I realized that it depended on which opening they&#39;d come out from. Which makes me wonder if one entry is closer to the nest while the other has foyer or something that makes it further away from the outside. They are back in huge numbers again. The size of that colony must be<br/>
 amazing. They aren&#39;t doing very well at getting there reproductive members out into the wider world as they are more gliders than fliers. Linnaea and her friend and I started talking about what bits of the ants were which and I got excited and found pictures of honey pot ants filled with whatever they are storing. One thing leads to others leads to more and than I&#39;ve learned a bunch and I&#39;m all excited and interested. Sigh...I just don&#39;t see how I&#39;m going to get through a day with all of these fascinating things that make up my life and not learn something. <br/>
<br/>
I did think that what I need are things like the alarms in Harrison Bergernon (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html)">http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html)</a> . I figure having loud noises ringing might actually keep me from thinking long enough to keep from learning anything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374800596">The goal of the story is equality, so those who are better at things are handicapped so that they can be equal with those who are not. Those who are smart have to wear radios headphones that sound off every few minutes to keep them from thinking. Vonnegut addresses acclimating to the bells and whistles and horns during the conversation. It is a powerful story. <br/>
