&gt; well said sandra.  Also, our playstation use goes in spurts.  Weeks and <br/>
&gt; weeks can go by with no usage and then Lexie will play it almost <br/>
&gt; constantly for hours and hours, days and days.  It&#39;s really good for her <br/>
&gt; fine motor skills, and she has fun so...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We do need another computer though, she has discovered the internet.  So <br/>
&gt; now there are three users and one computer.  Not a good number.  I need <br/>
&gt; to get a job.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have two computers and we have come to a system of sharing resources. :)<br/>
<br/>
I worried about Nintendo taking over so we rented one at first but the use has<br/>
been moderate. My husband and I were way more addicted to an old game off of<br/>
the commodore 64 called Toy Factory... I&#39;d love to play that again. <br/>
<br/>
Someone sent me this url yesterday, it looks pretty cool:<br/>
