<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382468779">I should probably go find the writing thread at www.unschooling.com and <br/>
deposit this, but I&#39;m not feeling so industrious today.  Or maybe the <br/>
industry is turned elsewhere!!<br/>
<br/>
I CAN GO UPSTAIRS!!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I made pancakes for the six or seven teenaged boys who were here, <br/>
and today I have two loaves of bread rising on the stove.  Woohoo!!<br/>
<br/>
I still get tired if I walk too much or stay up too much, but a week and a <br/>
half after getting the leg brace, I can walk without crutches some.  Good for <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope my family doesn&#39;t start expecting me to do everything I used to do <br/>
right away! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh... the writing thing will be in another post then.<br/>

well, I expect your leg still hurts like the devil, but it must feel good<br/>
to be able to get where you want to go, finally.<br/>

happy house.  I can&#39;t think how many pancakes that would be, my ten year<br/>
old can eat three.   I&#39;m picturing you flipping 35 pancakes, while<br/>
balancing on one leg...   <br/>

Congratulations!<br/>

And I can stand on two, or as Holly says, use the broken one as a kick-stand.<br/>
