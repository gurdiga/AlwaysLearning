<div id="ygrps-yiv-565913796">Hi, I look forward to gleaning all I can from this group.  My name is <br/>
Virginia (aka Gina) and I have homeschooled my kids all along.  I <br/>
have a 12 year old young man, an 8 year old boy, and a 5 year old <br/>
daughter.  Recently I have read a couple of books (one by John Gatto <br/>
and another by John Holt) and I am rethinking my &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>
philosophies.  Not that I have ever been really rigid, but I find a <br/>
lot of my thinking still grounded in the &quot;traditional&quot; stuff.  In <br/>
fact, this year is probably our most &quot;rigid&quot; schooling year ever, and <br/>
I suppose that is what has sprung me into looking into unschooling.  <br/>
I have been having fun comparing those rigid days when they have time <br/>
for no more school OR learning, to our supposed lazy days when the <br/>
kids are busy drawing, looking in their encyclopedias, playing piano, <br/>
and reading 400 page books.  LOL....Hmmmmm...<br/>
I am really thankful to have looked into this just in time.  I see <br/>
Sandra Dodd is on this list.  I will be hearing her on Thursday (in <br/>
just a couple of days) at our nearby Barnes and Noble store.  <br/>
Well, nice to &quot;meet&quot; you all.  <br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I had thought it would be difficult to get a turn online so hadn&#39;t <br/>
planned to get on except to do the neopets advent calendar (don&#39;t <br/>
forget, you neopets players), but everyone is so busy here at Pam <br/>
Sorooshian&#39;s that the computer just sits lots of times.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gina, maybe you&#39;ve already looked but there are collections of lots <br/>
of people&#39;s wonderful snippets of wisdom and happy reports linked <br/>
from here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
and the more parenting/everyday/philosophical aspect has a starting <br/>
place here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>
<br/>
Well maybe not MORE philosophical, but more esoteric.<br/>
No, not that...<br/>
There are two good starting places, a little differently slanted.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday before the talk in Rancho Cucamonga (which was really fun), <br/>
I was interviewed by Jason Marsh who&#39;s doing the graduate project for <br/>
a film-documentary class.  The day before, he had interviewed Pam at <br/>
the park, and Dan Vilter, and his volunteer camera and sound people <br/>
had done lots of candid-ish shots of kids doing things.  Holly was <br/>
interviewed a little bit, because she brought me a release form to <br/>
sign.  I asked her if she said something clever, and she said &quot;I hope <br/>
so,&quot; and I hoped so too.<br/>
<br/>
When he was interviewing me at Pam&#39;s house, though, there were others <br/>
right in the room, being quiet.  Pam, Jocelyn Vilter, Keith Dodd, <br/>
Holly, Rosie, Roya and her boyfriend Wilson, also unschooled and late <br/>
teens or twentiesh.  So they&#39;re asking me questions, and I have <br/>
lighting stuff on either side of me--a light stand with cloth and a <br/>
black cloth non-reflective whatever, and I can&#39;t see those other <br/>
people but I&#39;m hyper aware that they&#39;re there.  And on lots of <br/>
questions I would love to confer with them, or refer the question to <br/>
someone who&#39;d have a better answer.   It made me realize even more <br/>
sharply the value of our online opportunities.  When someone asks a <br/>
question here or at unschooling.info or unschooling.com or other such <br/>
places, they can get several responses, and often pretty quickly.  We <br/>
can bat the responses back and forth and provide links to support <br/>
statements other people make.  It&#39;s not just one person&#39;s opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty (and Wilson) are having a great time at the <br/>
convention, Gencon.  Today Rosie&#39;s going too.  Marty&#39;s in a <br/>
tournament (already pre-paid and registered) at 10:00 and Kirby and <br/>
Wilson are in another one at 11:00.  Keith and Holly are going to <br/>
Knott&#39;s Berry Farm to ride roller coasters.   They&#39;ll miss the big <br/>
opening of a new one there next week, after we&#39;ll have left.  That&#39;s <br/>
okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455231341">Hi Sandra...<br/>
Thanks for the links...and yes, I had already found my way there :)<br/>
I enjoyed your talk last night at B&N  I was there with my 12 year old<br/>
son, who although looked incredibly bored, did think you were funny.<br/>
&lt;smile&gt;<br/>
I think there is so much I can glean and I&#39;m really glad I am looking<br/>
into this new world of unschooling.  <br/>
Well I&#39;m off to help one of the kids fix his remote control car!<br/>
