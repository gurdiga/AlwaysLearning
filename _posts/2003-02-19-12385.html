<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065247259">I sent this to unschooling@yahoogroups, but they still seem to be down and I<br/>
really need some feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is an OK question to ask here.  Here is the short question: Any<br/>
advice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better endure a<br/>
4 hour car ride?  We have tried Dramamine (sort of works, but puts her out<br/>
and she HATES to take it); those bracelets that are worn on the wrist with<br/>
pressure points (didn&#39;t work); leave as late in the day as possible<br/>
(definitely helps); eating just the right amount beforehand and having<br/>
certain snacks for the ride (helps somewhat).  Reading doesn&#39;t help,<br/>
listening to stories on tape does.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some related stuff that I&#39;m thinking about.  This same daughter<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to go in elevators.  Not much of a problem, as there aren&#39;t<br/>
very many in our community, and the few that we do have are in short<br/>
buildings, so taking the stairs is a reasonable option.  Dd told gramma (my<br/>
mom) that she has a phobia about elevators.  (Dd learned that a fear of<br/>
something is called a phobia, and so she did use the term to refer to her<br/>
dislike of elevators, but has certainly never been to a psychologist for<br/>
diagnosis of this!)  My mom, who has a background in psychiatric nursing,<br/>
told me that I need to force her to go in elevators, because that is the<br/>
only way she will overcome this &quot;phobia&quot;.  Allowing her to avoid elevators<br/>
will only make it worse, she says.  My mom referred to her own &quot;phobia&quot; of<br/>
driving on the freeway.  She avoided the freeway for years, until finally<br/>
she needed to go some places that were nearly  impossible without freeway<br/>
driving.  She drives the freeway regularly now, though she still is<br/>
uncomfortable with it.  I pointed out that when she finally wanted to bad<br/>
enough, then she was able to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight at dinner, dh asked if we want to go with him this weekend to visit<br/>
Gramma, a 4 hour car ride.  Lisa had tears in her eyes and said she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like the car ride.  My recent conversation with my mom about the elevator<br/>
&quot;phobia&quot; came to mind, even though I thought my moms concerns were<br/>
overblown.  Everyone else in the family would like to go on the trip.  Lisa<br/>
would like to see Gramma, but doesn&#39;t want to have to go in the car to see<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to consider any thoughts that anyone is willing to share on this<br/>
issue.  She doesn&#39;t always get sick, but I know that trips are stressful for<br/>
her because she does worry about it.  I also know that &quot;feeling&quot; carsick,<br/>
even if you don&#39;t get sick, is NO FUN!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son used to get car sick but thankfully has grown out of it.  Still <br/>
occasionally happens.  What helps for us:<br/>
-Sitting in the front seat or somewhere so he can see out the front window.<br/>
-Having his window open a crack so he gets fresh air on his face<br/>
***-Stopping every 1/2 hour so he can walk around for a minute or two to get <br/>
grounded.    ( I thought of this one as I grew up on the water and every time <br/>
that I got sea sick it helped just being on land and it helps him with car <br/>
sickness too)  We didn&#39;t stop for long just at a rest stop or on a side road <br/>
so he could walk for a minute.  This was the greatest help.<br/>
<br/>
I also disagree with making anyone do anything especially if it is <br/>
frightening for them.  Although I don&#39;t have a psych degree and do not have a <br/>
phobia myself.  I would think it would make the fear worse to be pushed.  <br/>

food store I&#39;ve ever been to (sorry I can&#39;t be any more descriptive).<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm...I don&#39;t know if this is a problem, actually.  IMO there&#39;s <br/>
nothing wrong with using the stairs anywhere.  If you never have <br/>
to encounter something is it a problem?  I think forcing anyone to <br/>
do anything that is that uneccessary is a mistake and could only <br/>
cause more problems (but then I&#39;m not a psychiatric nurse).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly - it became necessary for her to drive on freeways and she <br/>
made it happen (as an adult, I might add, with nobody forcing her).<br/>
If someday your daughter decides that it&#39;s really necessary to <br/>
go to the observation deck at the Empire State Building and doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to climb all of those stairs I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll figure out a way <br/>
to deal with it.<br/>

or planes and if not, is this an option for you to visit her?<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963418501">*** Any<br/>
advice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better<br/>
endure a<br/>
4 hour car ride? ***<br/>
<br/>
Find a way for her to sit up front.   Rent a pickup if you have to (turn<br/>
the passenger airbag off) and follow the rest of your family there.  <br/>
Sitting up high like that in the front seat really helps.   She needs to<br/>
have an unobstructed view out the front window.   If she&#39;s a little ten<br/>
year old maybe a booster seat in the back seat of your car, in the middle<br/>
so she can see out if there&#39;s no way to sit up front.    <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t know Dylan got carsick until we sold our truck.   Stuck in the<br/>
back seat behind those tall bucket seats almost killed him.    We got<br/>
another truck.&lt;g&gt;    He can ride in the car now if he&#39;s up front, or in<br/>
the middle of the back seat and if he&#39;s wearing &quot;seabands&quot;  the bracelets<br/>
you talked about. <br/>
<br/>
Stop frequently.  After a bad case of carsickness hits the person can be<br/>
sick for hours or days.   It doesn&#39;t just stop when the car does.  <br/>
Awful!<br/>
<br/>
You can tell her that she doesn&#39;t have a phobia and not to worry about<br/>
it.   Sheesh!   So she doesn&#39;t like elevators!  Big deal.    She probably<br/>
doesn&#39;t like them for the same reason she&#39;d like to avoid a long car<br/>
ride.  She probably feels ill when she&#39;s on one.   I wouldn&#39;t force her,<br/>
she needs to be able to trust you to keep her safe.  You could foul all<br/>
that up if you force her to do something that&#39;s scary or sickening.  <br/>
Just let her be and tell Gramma to shush.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about the car sickness.   Nobody should ever feel that bad.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I doubt that stuff about the elevator is pertinent.  I got carsick *a lot*<br/>
as a kid.  Any curvy road and I was at least nauseous.  It stopped soon<br/>
after puberty, so you might be able to give her hope.  Commercial fishermen<br/>
around here put powdered ginger in capsules and take some before starting<br/>
out or at the first sign of bad weather.  I would try that, or make tea with<br/>
slices of ginger and honey, if she likes the taste of ginger.<br/>
<br/>
What worked for me as a child? -  *DON&#39;T READ!!!*  Someone else can read<br/>
aloud, or she can listen to books on tape, but she shouldn&#39;t try to focus on<br/>
anything *inside* the car, or even to the side of the car.  I used to have<br/>
to look at the centre line on the highway ahead.  Usually that meant sitting<br/>
in the front seat.  If you can drive when she would be sleepy, that&#39;s the<br/>
best.  It&#39;s weird, but lying down with eyes closed is fine, even sitting up<br/>
with eyes closed.  Sitting up and actually looking at something in the car?<br/>
No.  As much fresh air as possible.  If it&#39;s cold, maybe the window by her<br/>
could be open a little, or for a few minutes every hour.  Once she really<br/>
feels nauseous the best thing is to find a place to stop, let her stretch<br/>
and move around and get some fresh air.  Don&#39;t start again until her tummy<br/>
is fine.<br/>
Good luck to her!<br/>

<br/>
Let her ride in the front, and if it&#39;s not too cold, let outside air in.<br/>
Dramamine and sleeping were my dream conditions, but my parents didn&#39;t know <br/>
about Dramamine, so it wasn&#39;t until I was a teen and able to find it on my <br/>
own that I had that option.  I used to have to take it on planerides.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have to anymore, but I still do sometimes if it&#39;s going to be several <br/>
hours, because it knocks me out and I don&#39;t have to just &quot;BE&quot; for several <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
Remind her to breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe take tapes she will sing along to, because singing ends up inducing <br/>
deep breathing.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is smoking cigarettes in the car, make them stop it, clean out the <br/>
ashtray, and air out the deoderize and vacuum the car.  My parents both <br/>
smoked and I puked OFTEN.  Instead of undoing their filthy  habit, they just <br/>
laughed at me and told people I couldn&#39;t ride in a car without puking.<br/>
<br/>
When I stopped riding with THEM, I could ride fine if nobody was smoking.<br/>
<br/>
Reading makes it worse.  Any close work (sewing) where the peripheral vision <br/>
is moving but the eye-focus isn&#39;t will make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Stopping every hour or so to be still and walk and breathe outside air will <br/>
help.  Make a four hour drive a five hour drive with a half hour mid-stop and <br/>
two fifteen minute breaks.  That will help.<br/>

 I hope this is an OK question to ask here.  Here is the short question: Any<br/>
 advice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better endure a<br/>
 4 hour car ride?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Take some Ginger capsules before the ride (about 20-30 minutes ahead) and <br/>
take one every couple of hours during the ride.<br/>
Stop frequently for short breaks. <br/>
And she shouldn&#39;t do anything that requires her to not look out the window a <br/>
lot.<br/>
Reading, video games etc...all contribute to motion sickness. Her equilibrium <br/>
will be less overwhelmed if she can look out the window a lot. Preferably in <br/>
the front seat.<br/>

&gt; cause more problems (but then I&#39;m not a psychiatric nurse).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  My youngest was afraid of clowns from the time he was old enough to <br/>
notice other people (less than 3 months old).  We tried our best to avoid <br/>
them and now, of course, he can rationalize that fear away.  He was also <br/>
afraid of loud noises, or at least made incredibly uncomfortable by them.  <br/>
Like at concerts or the skating rink or parades or other places like that. <br/>
Still, he wanted to participate in things so we adapted.  We bought him <br/>
industrial style hearing protection.  He still doesn&#39;t like loud noises, but <br/>
he doesn&#39;t wear his earmuffs anymore or carry them in the car.  If we turn on <br/>
the vacuum cleaner, he just adopts &quot;the pose&quot;--one hand on one ear and one <br/>
ear crammed against his shoulder so he can use his other hand to keep doing <br/>
what he&#39;s doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine what my life would have been like and all I would have missed <br/>
if I had forced him to sit through a monster truck rally with no hearing <br/>
protection!  I think adapting and responding to his very obvious need was the <br/>
quickest way for him to grow through that period and learn to weigh the <br/>
risks/benefits and rationalize his fears, which is how fears are overcome.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there are patches now for motionsickness, and my friend who cannot ride <br/>
in a car without being behind the wheel actually went on a cruise using those <br/>
and survived quite well.  I think you get them with a prescription, but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure.<br/>

It would only be a strange question if the answer weren&#39;t yes.  That<br/>
would be me.  We still haven&#39;t started this project, having become<br/>
distracted by other things and ultimately ending up out here in<br/>
Albuquerque from last September through at least April or so if all goes<br/>
as it appears to be going.<br/>
<br/>
Our son, meanwhile, has found other interests for the moment.  Albuquerque<br/>
has several great museums, and for someone as interested as he is in<br/>
geology he couldn&#39;t be in a better place.  We&#39;ve climbed five volcanoes so<br/>
far and have a few more on our to-do list, not to mention countless past<br/>
(and future, I&#39;m sure) trips to the natural history museum.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, we&#39;re really looking forward to getting home to Missouri.<br/>
If all goes well it&#39;ll be a couple more months.  If it goes really well<br/>
we&#39;ll have enough money for a few months off in Missouri.  If not, we<br/>
could be temporarily relocating to NC, Florida, Ireland or somewhere<br/>
as-yet undetermined for another work junket.<br/>
<br/>
I miss being the primary at-home parent a great deal.  It&#39;s also really<br/>
isolating for me (less so for Sage who gets to go to homeschool groups and<br/>
the like) to be surrounded by *extremely* conventional people.  You begin<br/>
to wonder if work really *is* the only thing worth talking about.  Of<br/>
course I think the atmosphere would be even more uncomfortable at work if<br/>
I were to be really vocal about my opinions.<br/>

My sister&#39;s family went to the source of the Rio Grande once as a family <br/>
outing.  They didn&#39;t follow it to the ocean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a video we used to rent (should again) called The Cure.  It&#39;s about <br/>
two little boys who set out to travel to New Orleans, from Minnesota, maybe <br/>
(I think it&#39;s purposefully vague), on the Mississippi.  They have adventures. <br/>
  I don&#39;t remember whether there&#39;s stuff some families would find offensive.  <br/>
We didn&#39;t, but we&#39;re hard to offend.<br/>

&gt; Hi Todd - I always enjoyed our conversation on RUL, and wondered where<br/>
&gt; you had disappeared to.  Now I know - Albuquerque :0).<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed them as well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The follow the river to the ocean idea really stuck with me.  It sounds<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you reminded me of that, too.  I&#39;d almost forgotten about that<br/>
idea.  And as Sandra reminded me, the Rio Grande is right here in town.<br/>
Of course that could be a bigger project than we want to get into.<br/>
Trekking through the desert along the second longest river in the country<br/>
might be a bit much for me.  There&#39;s a nice photography display at the<br/>
Rio Grande nature center here in town, though, of photos that a woman took<br/>
as she walked the length several times (!) throughout her life.  And<br/>
a fairly nice video of the river at the Aquarium here as well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I imagine that making the transition from home to work would be<br/>
&gt; difficult enough without the added problem of being surrounded by people<br/>
&gt; whose priorities are not anything like your own.  I hope your plans to<br/>
&gt; move &#39;home&#39; soon work out for you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure wherever we go there we&#39;ll be and we&#39;ll find happiness there.<br/>
I&#39;m reasonably certain that we&#39;ll get to go home at least for a few weeks<br/>
before moving on, but as to how long that will be I&#39;m not really sure.  If<br/>
we&#39;re lucky we&#39;ll keep getting jobs in interesting locations as opposed<br/>
to the New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey area which is where a good<br/>
portion of my industry&#39;s work is.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear (again) from a caring, involved dad.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it feels like my husband&#39;s the only one around.  ~Rue<br/>
<br/>
Nope!  There&#39;s a few of us around.  I see them around town here rather a<br/>
lot, actually.<br/>

Yes, somehow my visual was more trees and mountains than desert :0). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010596533">I suffered badly as a child and still get wobbly sometimes now if I&#39;m in<br/>
the back seat or have to look at a map or read anything so I can<br/>
sympathize. Try everything that has been suggested as different things work<br/>
for different people. It&#39;s nasty and I can completely understand why she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to travel to see grandma. In no way can this be thought of as<br/>
a phobia. It doesn&#39;t meet any of the criteria necessary listed in the DSM<br/>
(psychologist&#39;s &quot;bible&quot;). Throwing up or nausea is really nasty, scary, and<br/>
just plain understandable to avoid.<br/>
And yes there is a type of aversion therapy in which you are thrown in the<br/>
deep end so to speak with your fear. But this is  never advised with<br/>
children and even with adults should only be done with someone highly<br/>
trained in this technique. Most children grow out of their childhood fears<br/>
(usually they cannot even be classified as phobias) and unless it starts to<br/>
interfere with normal life then nothing needs to be done.<br/>

William Least Heat Moon.  It&#39;s about his trip by river (mostly in a boat) <br/>
across the continent, generally following Lews & Clark&#39;s route.  He writes <br/>
lengthy books but I&#39;ve enjoyed them, and that one ties in with this tendency <br/>
(maybe it&#39;s just a desire!) I have to &quot;proceed as the way opens&quot;. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been working with a young man who is finishing up his degree in <br/>
geography.  I asked him what he was going to do with it and he said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going into GIS&quot;.  He was surprised to hear me say &quot;Oh?  Geographic <br/>
Information Systems?&quot;  He thought that no one had ever heard of it, much less <br/>
a 41 yo motherly type working next to him at a grunt job.  But he didn&#39;t know <br/>
that I used to work for a water utility and GIS was just beginning to make <br/>
it&#39;s impact on the utility industry before I left.  GIS is a mapping system <br/>
of the Earth.  Exactly what the name implies, but I had limited it to my <br/>
experience with utilities.<br/>
<br/>
So we had a conversation about it and he told me that GIS encompasses more <br/>
than utility lines location now.  I ask him how a degree in geography would <br/>
be relevant, wouldn&#39;t you want a degree in geology instead?  But of course, I <br/>
was thinking of on- the-surface type geography, like cities and borders and <br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
He said he&#39;d always wanted to travel and has been interested in the weather <br/>
since as long as he could remember and this seemed to fit the bill.  I asked <br/>
him how many times he&#39;d changed his major and he said he had never changed <br/>
it, because he always has known what he wanted to do.  (I admire that in <br/>
people.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Todd&#39;s son&#39;s interest in geology reminded me of this conversation.  <br/>
Perhaps GIS would be of interest to him, too.  Maybe he knows all about it <br/>
already.  But I bet there&#39;s someone else here who never heard of it!  :)<br/>
