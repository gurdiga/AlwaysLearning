&lt;&lt; So I was wondering Sandra when are you going to be in IL talking <br/>
<br/>
about &quot;strewing&quot; and what exactly does that entail?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly&quot;? <br/>
What, is this a TEST!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a page on strewing, and the talk will be a talk about that sort of <br/>
thing:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>
<br/>
and it leads to connect-the-dots ideas, and I&#39;ve started a page on that <br/>
though it&#39;s still sparse and not very pretty yet:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/connections">http://sandradodd.com/connections</a><br/>
<br/>
It all has to do with creating an environment where learning happens more <br/>
easily.<br/>
