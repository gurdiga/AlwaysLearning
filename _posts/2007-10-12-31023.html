Anyway, I thought this was all very interesting, and somewhat<br/>
amusing. I tend to assume these &quot;imposters&quot; were unschoolers, but it<br/>
did make me wonder if there are people who &quot;use homeschooling laws&quot;<br/>
just to be negligent, or if that&#39;s even possible to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered if it was common for traditional homeschoolers to<br/>
view unschoolers as being negligent, or imposters, or &quot;not really<br/>
homeschoolers,&quot; or something similar.<br/>
<br/>

In SC, we have to be a member of an Accountability Association in order <br/>
to homeschool. NOT that&#39;s it&#39;s very accountable!!! I run one now---and <br/>
know first-hand that there&#39;s NO accountability going on. Which is *JUST <br/>
FINE* by me---I can&#39;t figure out *why* accountability is necessary in <br/>
the first place. The *schools* aren&#39;t even remotely accountable, and <br/>
yet we expect the parents to be? To whom??? It&#39;s crazy!<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY...<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of people who join an association and say they <br/>
homeschool just so they don&#39;t have to fight with their <br/>
children---usually teens---about going to school. It&#39;s not about doing <br/>
the work or getting the grades---it&#39;s simply about *showing up*! They <br/>
can no longer *make* their kids go to school; so rather than fight with <br/>
them (and it&#39;s not the fight that is the issue: it&#39;s being *truant* <br/>
that&#39;s the problem. The parent is responsible!), they just say they <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
They are *certainly* not UNschooling---not by *my* definition, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Paraphrasing Holt (because I tried to find the quote, but kept getting <br/>
side-tracked and spent 50 ennjoyable minutes googling Holt quotes! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;): Better to sit back and do nothing than allow the harm actively <br/>
done in school.<br/>
<br/>
So if a parent wants to pull a child out of school and &quot;let him <br/>
be&quot;---to me, that&#39;s preferable than forcing him in school. It&#39;s NOT <br/>
unschooling---even by a long shot, but it&#39;ll be less damaging.<br/>

Ideally, or in the average-to-above-average range, I agree.<br/>
<br/>
If those teens are out inflicting damage on the world while the moms  <br/>
are ignoring them and thinking &quot;Gosh, I love homeschooling!&quot; then  <br/>
it&#39;s not as good.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between being a dropout and a homeschooler, for kids  <br/>
over 15 in some states, isn&#39;t so different.<br/>
<br/>
My kids couldn&#39;t be drop outs as they&#39;d never dropped in. &lt;g&gt;  But  <br/>
the drop outs I&#39;ve known in my life have tended toward shame (ashamed  <br/>
of themselves for &quot;being failures&quot; or ashamed of their circumstances)  <br/>
or anger (angry with school, parents, life).<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t ashamed or angry.<br/>
<br/>
And in states where it&#39;s no longer even legal to drop out of high  <br/>
school, homeschooling is the legal way to drop out.<br/>
<br/>
Things will keep changing.  They&#39;re changing now and can&#39;t stop  <br/>
changing.  I don&#39;t know what will finally happen, but I do know that  <br/>
what I do, what I write, is part of the bigger flow of change.<br/>
<br/>
I think even with teens, though, parents can and should pay attention  <br/>
to what they might not know.  That goes for parents of teens in  <br/>
school, though, too!<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids seems never to have heard of something, I give a  <br/>
little information about the thing and maybe leave a book out-- <br/>
still.  Always have (probably always will).  If they&#39;re behaving in a  <br/>
way that others might be cringing about or that&#39;s potentially a  <br/>
problem, I&#39;ll mention my concern and my reasoning.  Sometimes they  <br/>
care right then and sometimes not.  Sometimes they change later when  <br/>
I&#39;m not looking.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents figure the kids will learn somewhere, someday, things  <br/>
like table manners and how to use a phone book.  Without lessons or  <br/>
rules, they can still be coached to be smoother in the world.<br/>
