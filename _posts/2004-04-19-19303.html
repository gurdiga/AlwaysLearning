&lt;&lt; now I don&#39;t even talk about quitting, I just say trying. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in a bit you could move from &quot;trying&quot; to &quot;doing.&quot;<br/>

If he played piano intensely for months, he DID something, didn&#39;t try <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I took lessons when I was really young, and learned to read music.  Then I <br/>
quit for five or six years, but I still messed with it and played the books I <br/>
had, and started sight-reading other things.  Hymnals mostly.   I started <br/>
lessons again when I was 13 or so and it was fun again.  Things don&#39;t have to be <br/>
regularly scheduled or even sequential to be worthwhile!<br/>
