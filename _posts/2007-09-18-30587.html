<div id="ygrps-yiv-840546621">Hi there, I am new to this group, although I have belonged to some others over the years. I have come slowly to the conclusion that unschooling is the only sane choice for us, but I&#39;m having some problems with some of the ways my boys spend most of their time. They are avid skateboarders and snowboarders at 10 and 13. For the past 2 years there has been little else that interests them. So I have done my best to accomidate this interest. We are embarking on building a huge back yard skatepark, and much money math has been learned while shopping for cool duds. But now it seems that whenever I strive to &quot;strew their paths with interesting items&quot; it is met with resentment that I am trying to lead too much. I asked them what they wanted to learn this fall, to get a better clue. And suprisingly, they wanted many &quot;school subjects&quot; but when I actually offer to help them learn these things, they never have the time....<br/>
  Being basically highly intellectual and interested in everything, its killing me to think that possibly they are closing their minds to things that might have some good use. Anyone have any advice for me?<br/>

<br/>
Wait...<br/>
Strewing shouldn&#39;t be leading.<br/>

<br/>
Just leave things visible.  If they don&#39;t pick them up and play with  <br/>
them, that needs to be okay.<br/>
<br/>
-=I asked them what they wanted to learn this fall, to get a better  <br/>
clue. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ask them what they want to learn.  That doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
unschooling sense.<br/>
You, the mom, need to look closer to see what they&#39;re already learning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works when life is rich and full and busy and fun!  They  <br/>
don&#39;t need to know what they want to learn.  They need to learn  <br/>
without knowing it even happened.<br/>

<br/>
If you hope for them to want school lessons, you won&#39;t see unschooling.<br/>
This might help:<br/>

It&#39;s not like taking several steps, it&#39;s like turning, right where  <br/>
you&#39;re already standing, and looking the other direction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A few years ago, when I was a county contact for the HomeSchool <br/>
Association of California, I took a call from a mom who was looking for <br/>
help; her son was in a school-based home program, but it wasn&#39;t meeting <br/>
his needs and the paperwork was interfering with his schedule.  She <br/>
wasn&#39;t too concerned about his future, as, at 16, he was already a <br/>
millionaire, tops in his field, would have been in the most recent <br/>
Olympics if not for an age thing, had already beaten all the guys who <br/>
did win...  Now, since my kids were not into the same things, I didn&#39;t <br/>
know about this homeschooler, but we do now...  This call was from <br/>
Shaun White&#39;s mom.<br/>
