<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not really a radical unschooler,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes people who haven&#39;t fully embraced radical unschooling do grasp important parts like being attentive and responsive to children&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people, though, members join with the idea that this forum is a &quot;Let&#39;s trade ideas that work for us.&quot; When the purpose of the forum is to respond to situations with radically unschooling approaches. The purpose is to provide a point of view that can&#39;t be found on mainstream parenting advice.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do hope you read the introductory emails that explains that *all* posts, whether initial questions or responses to questions, will be analyzed in light of radical unschooling ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I got the dentist to take photos of how to clean teeth with a proper model of teeth,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good idea for learning anything. Being attentive and responsive to how your own child learns, can help lower frustration! :-) Still as an adult I appreciate a combination of pictures and words. If a child wants to learn something, it&#39;s helpful not to focus on the &quot;right&quot; way and to focus on how the child learns.<br/>
<br/>
What is also a great idea is being aware of when the *child* wants the information. Before a child is interested, parents can strew interesting posters, charts, pictures. Put them up for a while. Then replace them with something else. Don&#39;t make them all self improvement charts! Imagine the message your husband would be sending about his view and acceptance of you if he put up charts on How to Lose Weight, How to Eat Healthy, How to Cook Toast Properly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once I stopped cleaning my sons teeth at about age 4,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did he ask you to stop? If not, I&#39;m wondering why you stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Did you think age 4 was &quot;old enough&quot;? Did you fear that if you kept brushing he&#39;d never learn himself? That you&#39;d have to accompany him to college to brush his teeth for him?<br/>
<br/>
For radical unschooling to flourish, parents need to look at what their children are showing they&#39;re capable of rather than at charts, ages and advice from experts who&#39;ve never set eyes on your child.<br/>
<br/>
Children will show they&#39;re ready by doing. Humans are driven to become more competent. We want to do things ourselves. No child will go off to college still needing his mom to brush his teeth ... Unless she sends messages that he can&#39;t do it when he shows signs of wanting to! This video Drive by Daniel Pink explains it clearly:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I made sure that he followed the instructions but I rarely say anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you &quot;make sure&quot; in a relationship building way? It&#39;s one of those weaselly phrases that sounds so gentle. But in practice, unless a child wants to do something -- in which case there&#39;s no need to &quot;make sure&quot; -- it often involves some harsh preparation to prevent the child from defying the mom&#39;s wishes. In many cases that preparation may have come months or years before on other things the mom wanted the child to do so the child knows if they protest the consequences will be harsh.<br/>
<br/>
What is more relationship building is being with a child to support him in doing as much as he wants and to fill in for him where he can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  He also uses a mouthwash so I&#39;m happy that he is doing a good job even though it may not be perfect every time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have a simple rule in our house, no teeth cleaning means no food,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes it convenient for you. For a someone who can&#39;t find another home where the adults will feed him because they love him, it&#39;s cruel.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if your husband wanted the house tidier than you felt was necessary he could withhold access to the household money until you were performing to his standards. That sounds like a good idea, doesn&#39;t it? It sounds like a great way to build a loving, trusting partnership doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have explained the importance and my son knows that he has to clean his teeth,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I wrote in Sandra&#39;s Unschooling Info forum on Facebook to a different issue, but the principles are the same,<br/>
**********<br/>
One of the bigger relationship errors parents make is assuming that understanding is the same as being able to do. Then when a child does the wrong thing, the assumption is the child is deliberately choosing to be rude. Or lazy. Or defiant. (So the parent reprimands. And shames. And punishes.) Or somehow not understanding something so simple. (So the parent explains. And explains. And explains.)<br/>
<br/>
If your child is being rude or defiant, there&#39;s something wrong in the relationship. (Or he&#39;s having a really hard time with his feelings.) He&#39;s feeling pushed around, not listened to, disconnected. Be more aware of how you&#39;re treating him. See his reactions as feedback on how well you&#39;re treating him.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s being &quot;lazy&quot; then you&#39;re expecting too much. He&#39;s not being lazy. He can&#39;t yet care in the way he needs to. Be what he needs to be. Create a pleasant atmosphere for him to grow in maturity.<br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t understanding when your explanation is clear, either he can&#39;t yet understand or something is in the way of him acting on his understanding. In either case, stop explaining. Help him notice. Ask him what might be in the way so you can get those things out of his way. Be what he needs to be until he can be it.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we have had tantrums in the past over this but it does not usually l<br/>
&gt; ast more than a few minutes - no breakfast is a strong motivator.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if a husband wrote to a &quot;Be a better spouse&quot; forum about his wife, &quot;She got really upset in the past over this to the point of sobbing but it doesn&#39;t usually last more than a few minutes. No breakfast is a strong motivator,&quot; you&#39;d think, &quot;Wow, what a great marriage they must have. I wish I had a husband like that.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332298244"><p><span style="line-height:13.333333015441895px;">Toothbrushing is one of the first issues some parents stress over - the first time they realize that they really can&#39;t control what their kids will do or learn about the world. That&#39;s scary - and it leads some parents to do Insane things, like forced toothbrushing or refusing the child basic needs like food or sleep or parental affection. Things that if you suggested treating another adult that way would be considered cruelty. Those are panic moves - they don&#39;t do what parents think/hope they&#39;ll do. At best, they &quot;win&quot; and their child loses a bit of bodily integrity while learning something about bullying.</span><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Teeth are way, way too small of an issue for the amount of stress parents can tie to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Relax.</p><p>&nbsp;Unbrushed teeth aren&#39;t a disaster. There are lots of other options for oral hygiene, as well as the option of letting this one go, like shoes with no socks. If you brush your own teeth regularly, make it a chance to invite your child to do something with you, make it easy and light and fun, not a chore. If toothbrushing is a chore for you, think about that - you don&#39;t Have to brush your teeth. Explore some alternatives like rinses, wipes, tongue scrapers, cleansing foods. Read up on pH and the mineralization-demineralization cycle. Take the opportunity to learn rather than trying to teach and turning into a bully.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p></div>

How do kids learn about teeth? The same way they learn about religion, or mud, or music, or reading. Something comes up and a connection is made, a trail is followed or disregarded, and life flows on.

<p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">
<span style="font-size:13px;">Learning about the world is a grand endeavor. It&#39;s deep and convoluted. There are side shoots and backwaters, trails that go no-where but are still marvelous, connections that seem unimportant but later blossom in spectacular, unexpected ways. How do kids learn about teeth? The same way they learn about religion, or mud, or music, or reading. Something comes up and a connection is made, a trail is followed or disregarded, and life flows on. Along the way there&#39;s mythology and chemistry, birthday parties and trips to the grocery store. </span></p>
<p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">
<span style="font-size:13px;">One day my daughter spent four hours watching water flow over a creek bed. She learned about the movement of light on water, the articulation of fish and creepy-crawlies, about the smell of summer and the satisfaction of a day well spent. And she lost a tooth and learned that the darned things are hard to find, dropped on a pebbly shore. And life flowed on. </span></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006994481"><blockquote><span title="ireply"><p><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;">&gt;&gt;debate delayed gratification in the young child with ASC&lt;&lt;</span><br class="ygrps-yiv-2006994481yui-cursor"></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;"><br> </span></p></span></blockquote><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Step back from the idea of &quot;delayed gratification&quot; and think about what you mean by it. Most of the time what&#39;s meant is that a child should be serenely patient in the face of stress, something many adults can&#39;t do with any kind of consistency. It&#39;s a good example of adults holding children to a higher standard than they hold themselves. Kids with disabilities are often held to an even higher standard in that regard.</p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">When kids are given lots of support, when their world is &quot;a soft meadow of yesses&quot; (Sandra&#39;s phrase, and I love it) they have more internal resources to deal with stress. That&#39;s not a guess, it&#39;s the common experience of unschooling parents, especially those of us with more intense children. Helping kids promptly in the ways they want to be helped (immediate help, not &quot;you&#39;ll thank me when you&#39;re older&quot;) actually sets them up to learn about grace and thoughtfulness, patience and care because they&#39;re not in the position of feeling like they need to clamor to get what they need.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">When support is denied to teach some lesson or other, what is actually learned will have more to do with the child&#39;s perception than the parent&#39;s goals. So &quot;delayed gratification&quot; for some people means simmering in wait for the moment to strike back. For others it means giving up. For others it means turning around and taking something from someone else. For still others it means a sense that life is full of duty after chore after obligation. For some it means resentment.</p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">For kids with disabilities, &quot;delayed gratification&quot; and related lessons can result in enormous resentment. Brie mentioned that in another thread recently, she said&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">&lt;&lt;<span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">In raising children with chronic illnesses, resentment is responsible for the worst possible outcomes - for non-compliance, for lying and sneaking and pretending that one doesn&#39;t have X condition and doesn&#39;t need to do Y to survive, which sadly leads to detrimental, sometimes deadly choices.&gt;&gt;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">&nbsp;The point isn&#39;t to scare anyone, it&#39;s that learning is a Personal experience.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473510736">I can&#39;t find mention of how old your child is, so this may not be useful, but I recently had an opportunity to sort through tons of my own big feelings around tooth brushing with my daughter. She is 1.5, and the first of my three kids to want nothing to do with me brushing her teeth. <br/>
<br/>
She was born with a severe tongue tie and was unable to nurse well (and couldn&#39;t take any bottles at all) and had two minor (but very traumatic) surgeries by the time she was six weeks old. She subsequently developed an oral aversion that made the early months scary for me (she would become resistant to anything near her mouth and refuse to eat), and taught me more about patience than I had realized possible. From early infancy, she would completely resist anyone coming near her mouth unless they asked first and were given &quot;permission&quot; (for example, a doctor wanting to look in her mouth. I would ask, if she resisted I would not let the doctor try). This was instrumental in allowing her to relax and trust again (and eventually to be able to eat solids without gagging and choking). <br/>
<br/>
She got teeth quite early, and I attempted to clean her teeth as I had her brothers (with a finger brush) but she vehemently refused, and I didn&#39;t push. Once she showed interest in her brothers brushing their teeth (around 10 months) we got her her own toothbrush, and she began imitating them. I would ask every couple of weeks or so I I could help her (my sons still ask me to &quot;finish&quot; their brushing for them), and she almost always said no.<br/>
<br/>
About a month ago, I allowed my fears to gain too much hold in my mind, and decided I needed to try to push harder to help her clean her teeth. After several days of asking and her refusing, I made a horrible mistake and tried to brush her teeth anyway. I went against my instinct, and I will regret it forever. She looked in my eyes and began to cry. I stopped immediately, but the damage was done. She cried hard in my arms, pointing at her mouth and the toothbrush, shaking her head no. I cried with her, told her I was so sorry, that it was wrong and that I shouldn&#39;t have done it. After she calmed down and nursed, we played a game that my kids have all loved that has served as a strong counter to feelings of powerlessness: I get down on the floor and let her knock me over, again and again, exclaiming wildly while she jumped, bounced and climbed all over me while I was on the ground. I made an effort to play this game with her whenever she asked over the next week, and I did not ask to brush her teeth again. She continued to ask for her toothbrush (she loves the toothpaste!) when her brothers were brushing her teeth, and I began to sing more silly songs when helping her brothers with their teeth, which she always laughed at. <br/>
<br/>
After about a week, it occurred to me that it might be very helpful for her to see me brushing my teeth more (instead of after she went to bed, which was the usual), so I got out my toothbrush and brushed with the boys. I sat down with her and asked if she could help me, and she loved it! It really reminded me how vulnerable it feels to have someone else sticking something in my mouth; it was hard to relax! She kept handing the brush back to me, watching how I brushed, and taking it back to do it again. When we were done, I thanked her, and told her that I appreciate her helping me keep my teeth clean and healthy. We did this for several more days, and one night she handed me her toothbrush and opened her mouth! I gently brushed two teeth, singing a song, and she took it back and smiled, brushing herself. Every time since then, she has asked for my &quot;help&quot; brushing, sometimes wanting me to brush all of her teeth, sometimes not, and it feels just right. Sometimes she goes around the whole house, asking brothers, dad, auntie and Grampa to take turns brushing. I know that my attitude around the brushing has shifted so much, and there is not way that I would have felt safe with someone putting something in my mouth if they held as much anxiety about it as I had been.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542385051">Reluctance to clean teeth here is only recent. Last night I asked if it ok to download a couple of cool apps on new iPod that had some fun stuff about why its good to clean teeth. This idea was received well and was enjoyed and along with some new toothpaste chosen and decision to have own brush with own cup (we have four children and tiny bathroom so mostly it&#39;s a shared cup) there had been renewed enthusiasm towards cleaning teeth.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391975975"><p dir="ltr">Both of my children 9yo and 5yo have had what the dentists call significant dental carries in their primary teeth. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The dentists will tell you it is the food they are eating and that you arent brushing &quot;x&quot; amount of times in a day. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I have met people who hardly brush and have a diet rich in high carb, sugary foods who hardly get cavities. I however was prone to cavities as a youngester and enjoyed many sweets and brushed when I remembered to brush. I can unfortunately remember my moms voice yelling that my toothbrush was dry therefore I hadn&#39;t brushed my teeth and I had better do it. </p>

<p dir="ltr">This is the voice of childhood I want to avoid for my kids. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I ended up being a dental assistant for many years before being mom. My mom would have been surprised I am sure with all the upset and worry she had with me not brushing. (She passed away when I was 13). </p>

<p dir="ltr">What I have found to be useful is to be consistent with my own habits. I like to brush or chew peelu gum in the morning and brush and floss at night. My 9yo brushes at night. My 5yo likes to chew the gum in the day and brush at night. </p>

<p dir="ltr">When there are new toothbrushes in the house I notice they brush like crazy. I recently purchased new flossers and my 5yo LOVES them. Anything she can do herself is a plus. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Keep it exciting. Toothpaste, brushes, floss, mouthwash, gum,  for a bit I got baby tooth wipes and kept them in the bathroom and car. We also made our own baking soda toothpaste that my 9yo liked. Lots to explore in our mouths you can usually find little mouth mirrors at the grocery store too.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sandra&#39;s quote &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch&quot; is so right on. </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592838887"><p dir="ltr">I think there are many reasons why people have problems with their teeth. Brushing and flossing doesn&#39;t always bring good dental outcomes. Not brushing and flossing doesn&#39;t always bring bad dental outcomes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">My kids brush their teeth when they want to, which is not as often as I brush mine. They love going to the dentist, and the dentist always says their teeth look great. We have a friend we&#39;ve know since she was18 months old, on whom tooth brushing is rigidly enforced. When she was little, one parent used to hold her down while the other brushed her teeth. At 8, she just got her 5th and 6th crowns installed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I remember being annoyed by my father nagging me to brush, going in the bathroom, wetting my toothbrush, running the tap for a plausible duration, and avoiding him afterward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not brushing and flossing may or may not be harmful. I think being forced to brush and floss is definitely harmful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I think when we tell our children something just awful is going to happen if they do/don&#39;t something, and the predicted disaster fails to materialize, we lose a lot of credibility.</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073782546"><p dir="ltr">I think it would be fun to explain to the child about the mouth germs. What happens when we leave them there, and what happens when we brush. Get a hold of the Colgate tablets that turn red or blue when there is still a bit of dirt in the mouth or teeth. It could be fun for the child to see if he/she can win the fight against the germs in the mouth. Make up a story each time, on how there are some meanies that are trying to attack the kingdom  inside the mouth. The teeth being the horses that the germs want to take over, and the toothbrush is the strongest knight, trying to push them away as the child is brushing, I mean there can be so many stories created, as the child is brushing, and going back to see if there is still any red or blue meanies left that need to be taken cared of.<br>

Making it fun and exciting for the child, works pretty much all the time. Children are creative by nature, it is the adults that sometimes find it troublesome,  but ask them for some ideas, and create together...<br>
Sometimes my kids will ask if it&#39;s okay for them to go to bed without brushing, and since I have explained to them about refined sugars and what they can do to our teeth, they will choose to skip their dessert if they don&#39;t feel like brushing that night. There have been times when they don&#39;t really want to brush but they really want their sweet,  so all they do is gargle with listerine, I tnk explaining to them goes a looooong way. They know how to make the right choice for themselves. </p>

They love going to the dentist, and the dentist always says their teeth look great.==</span><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;">This is our experience also. My son is 7.5. he doesn&#39;t mind having his teeth brushed at all (I do it for him, in bed usually, with kids pineapple flavour toothpaste), but we often forget, or he falls asleep before we do it - a variety of reasons mean it often doesn&#39;t get done daily.</span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;">He recently went for his first ever dental appointment and the dentist positively raved about how good his teeth were! She wanted to parade him around in front of the waiting room as a poster boy for good dental&nbsp;hygiene! &nbsp;Clearly he has a genetic propensity to good teeth, since our dental&nbsp;hygiene&nbsp;regime is pretty sketchy and he eats whatever he likes (which does include candy&nbsp;and chocolate, as well as &#39;good teeth&#39; foods like cheese, apples, etc).</span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;">His Dad has great teeth and hardly any cavities, and I don&#39;t have terrible teeth, despite eating large amounts of chocolate as a kid and not brushing much at all until I was a teenager (just FYI - now I am fastidious about my tooth hygiene!)</span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.854166984558105px;">Don&#39;t think of tooth brushing as the be-all of tooth&nbsp;hygiene. If you are genetically prone to dental problems like cavities, then&nbsp;brushing and flossing *may* help &nbsp;to some degree, but they won&#39;t stop them altogether. Read the page recommended at Joyce&#39;s site, especially what Schuyler has to say a little way down the page about mouth bacteria :)</span><br></font><br>Jo<br><pre><img vspace="9" src="https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphics.hotmail.com%2Fgreypixel.gif&t=1571493640&sig=qSnc7r37FLRu_7XhzOrT3g--~E" width="100%" height="2"></pre>
