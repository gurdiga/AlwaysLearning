<div id="ygrps-yiv-707961045">I have many.  However, reading this link in tonight&#39;s paper made me incredibly thankful that my family is pursuing this path of learning without school, especially in my community. My community is very small, and the schools are ranked the best in the state, as well as very high in the country. People who live in neighboring communities lie, beg, and borrow to put their kids in school here (my Parents included, as they begged long enough to get me in).  The woman who wrote this article has been writing weekly articles related to school, teens, and preventing teen crime and drug abuse.  Her writing style stinks, IMO, but this last post just made me feel highly relieved that my kids are not in that environment.  Ironically she&#39;s promoting Unschooling by promoting all the things she&#39;s been advocating for all year.  I felt compelled to share.<br/>
