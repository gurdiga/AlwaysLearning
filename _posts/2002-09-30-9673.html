<div id="ygrps-yiv-269151059"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I apologize for sending my message FOUR times, I was<br/>
&gt;having trouble with my email<br/>
&gt;Leslie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s alright Leslie, it happens.  Next though, could<br/>
you work on not sending out the entire digest with<br/>
each reply?  Maybe you might consider changing your<br/>
subject headings from digest numbers as well.  Not<br/>
being snipey, just gently asking you to be aware of<br/>
that.  Thank you!<br/>
