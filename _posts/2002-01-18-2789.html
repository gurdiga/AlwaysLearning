&gt; Tonight we&#39;re having someone for dinner.  That&#39;s for real.<br/>

&gt; Tomorrow morning a family I like a lot is coming for lunch and <br/>
&gt; game-playing.<br/>

&gt; Kirby wants to learn to cook.<br/>

&gt; Holly is spending the night with her friend.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find it conventient to operate according to a model that says, yes, I have <br/>
a soul. But, on the other hand, there&#39;s no particular reason to believe that. <br/>
And I&#39;m comfortable with holding those seemingly opposing thoughts in my head <br/>
at one time &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The model of this lifetime that works for me is that we&#39;re here to develop <br/>
something - probably sensitivities of various kinds - to improve our <br/>
character in some way. And it makes sense to me that there&#39;s a reason for <br/>
that and it is either to help civilization progress even though we won&#39;t be <br/>
part of it after we&#39;re dead - or because we will still be part of it in some <br/>
way that we can&#39;t at all foresee. It seems obvious to me that we&#39;re built to <br/>
&quot;learn&quot; and to try to improve ourselves and so the purpose of life, if there <br/>
is one, has something to do with that. Now - there may be no purpose to life <br/>
and that&#39;s okay - like Sandra said it doesn&#39;t really matter. I still have <br/>
family and friends and I still have things to do and I still try constantly <br/>
to figure out how to live a life that seems &quot;good&quot; to me. My behavior won&#39;t <br/>
be any different one way or the other. And I&#39;m WAY too much of a scientist to <br/>
just &quot;accept&quot; on faith that there is an afterlife where some sort of soul <br/>
lives on. So I think of it as a &quot;model&quot; and it works as a way to live because <br/>
ANY choice of what to believe is just that - a chosen model. This one makes <br/>
sense to me. It isn&#39;t &quot;science&quot; since it can&#39;t be proved wrong - at least not <br/>
in this lifetime. But I guess it IS science &lt;G&gt; but only within the <br/>
constructs of the model that includes the existence of an afterlife since <br/>
that&#39;ll be the time when the assumption of a soul will be tested empirically. <br/>
Wait - I&#39;m going in circles again -- doesn&#39;t that just ALWAYS seem to happen <br/>
when we think about these kinds of things? &lt;BEG&gt; Still, it is fun.<br/>
