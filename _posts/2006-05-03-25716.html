<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717073456">Why does he have to get up by noon??<br/>
<br/>
Is he complaining about not getting enough friends time?  Can his <br/>
friends come over in the afternoon or evening or can you go there?  <br/>
Can&#39;t you all get together at 2 in the afternoon or some such?<br/>
<br/>
Is he happy?<br/>
<br/>
Haha, daylight time - we try to hide from it now in AZ! :)  My 14 <br/>
year old wants to paint his room black and turn it into a recording <br/>
studio (which btw, if anyone knows a good source for used recording <br/>
equipt, do send offline to me! :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all night owls!  Except my husband. :)  And that&#39;s only <br/>
because he chose to take a job - when he was the stay at home <br/>
person, he was on the same timezone we were.  Since I have my own <br/>
business and it&#39;s database/computer related, I can do most of it at <br/>
anytime, just need a little overlap with client 9-5 time. For a <br/>
while, my husband thought we should all get up earlier and still <br/>
makes the occasional comment about &#39;sleeping in&#39; as do some of our <br/>
friends, which gets old at times. I don&#39;t make fun of them for being <br/>
in bed by 10 (which I can&#39;t even imagine). Okay, I did make fun of <br/>
my husband when he went to bed at 8 or 9, but I&#39;ve stopped!<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to hear any argument that holds water about when someone <br/>
should go to bed or get up as long as they are happy and getting <br/>
enough sleep. :)<br/>
<br/>
I went to traditional school and continually had a hard time getting <br/>
up so early.  It didn&#39;t &#39;train&#39; me in any way.  In fact, I got a job <br/>
right out of high school working at the airport which is a 24/7 <br/>
operation and I was never happier. 3pm-11pm shift or 11pm-7am shift <br/>
work find for me! :)  I like coming home when the world is waking <br/>
up.  I love that early morning time, but as the last thing in the <br/>
day, not the first! :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy doing that, but that would definately put us out of the <br/>
social loop, so we&#39;re just a little off.  My 6 year old usually goes <br/>
to bed about midnight or 1am and gets up about 10 or 11 and my 14 <br/>
year old maybe goes to bed about 2 or 3 and gets up about noon or <br/>
1.  I go to bed anywhere from midnight to three (just after the 6 <br/>
year old) and get up about 8 or 9 or sometimes 10. :)  Works for <br/>
us. :)   Breakfast at noon, dinner with daddy and snacks late at <br/>
night. :)<br/>
<br/>
We are mostly homebodies, so no problem most of the time, but when <br/>
we do schedule something, we try to schedule it in the afternoon. We <br/>
have a weekly playgroup at 1pm on Tuesdays and otherwise, just <br/>
whatever we arrange or comes up - we always suggest afternoon! :)<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s something that&#39;s ONLY in the morning, like tomorrow we have <br/>
a play to go to (Sword in the Stone) we&#39;ll make it down there by <br/>
9:30am, but our day will be a little off.  As long as it&#39;s only once <br/>
in a while, we can handle it and just make up for the sleep lost <br/>
another day.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up, my parents always told me what what the right and wrong <br/>
way to do everything, but I never got a copy of the manual! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a reason he needs to be up by noon?<br/>
<br/>
I used to say I wanted my kids to get up by noon.  Then we moved to  <br/>
others in the house only needing to be quiet until noon, and now  <br/>
sometimes we&#39;re quiet longer if someone&#39;s still asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I used to tell them it was fine for them to stay up late as long as  <br/>
they were in bed by 5:00, because I was embarrassed to think their  <br/>
dad would find them awake still.  Then I found out he though it was  <br/>
interesting, and would go in and see what Kirby was doing (it was  <br/>
always Kirby) and get to say bye to him.<br/>
<br/>
It was arbitrary, and designed to protect my potentially-embarrassed  <br/>
feelings, so I let it drop years ago.<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;it&#39;s a struggle&quot; gives the struggle not only power but makes  <br/>
it an entity.   That&#39;s not correct.<br/>
Someone is struggling.  Are you struggling to wake him up?  Is he  <br/>
struggling to stay asleep?  Why struggle?<br/>
<br/>
Marty used to stay up late, but once he had a job, he would go to  <br/>
sleep nine or ten hours before he wanted to wake up.  Lately, that is  <br/>
9:30.  He added an hour; he used to go to sleep at 8:30.  He&#39;s 17  <br/>
years old and decides and executes his own unnaturally early bedtime  <br/>
so he can get up at 5:30, so he can have a leisurely breakfast and  <br/>
watch the weather before he goes outside to work.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what can happen if you let a kid choose his own hours.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Though, I must say, he is a very complex guy. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way for complex guys as simple and plain  <br/>
guys.<br/>
His complexity is him!<br/>

 <br/>
After working years on 3rd shift, 4 days per week, (5:00 pm to 2:30 am) I  <br/>
have completely let go of wanting everyone up by a certain time.  And I  worked <br/>
with a lot of people who worked 1st shift, 10:00 pm to 8:00.  If  someone can <br/>
work those hours, more power to them!!  They will make more  money (night <br/>
differential) and it frees up your daytime or afternoon to do  whatever you want <br/>
to do!  You&#39;re not at work while everything is open  (banks, library, etc), and <br/>
usually the senior workers aren&#39;t there so the  work atmosphere is much more <br/>
laid back.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, I kind of look at it as a plus.  After working 3rd shift for so  long, I <br/>
easily switched back to being a &quot;daytime&quot; person, though we are all late  <br/>
risers.  My philosophy has been, if someone&#39;s body is telling them, &quot;keep  <br/>
sleeping&quot; there&#39;s a reason, and I let them sleep.  I have one daughter that  doesn&#39;t <br/>
get up till close to noon each day, and at midnight she&#39;s completely  awake.  <br/>
If we absolutely HAVE to be someplace early, she can make herself  get up, and <br/>
she just takes a nap in the afternoon.<br/>

the parents felt like quoting, then augmented by a few quotes they  <br/>
THOUGHT were in there but were actually Shakespeare (and not always  <br/>
the best characters to be emulating), or Samuel Butler (that &#39;spare  <br/>

The main thing binding my parents was the &quot;honor thy father and thy  <br/>
mother,&quot; which they took to mean to do what they said and make your  <br/>
kids do the same things.  They seemed to think that &quot;the rules&quot; went  <br/>
back in an unbroken chain to vaguely Jesus or Adam, and that that&#39;s  <br/>
just the way it was supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s that charming but hypocritical Benjamin Franklin and  <br/>
his alleged penning (maybe just publication of what others had been  <br/>
saying) of<br/>
Early to bed and early to rise<br/>
Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.<br/>
<br/>
First, Franklin was an infamous partier.  And second, in those days,  <br/>
those who got up first and went to bed first were servants, and they  <br/>
weren&#39;t likely to be getting any wealthier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835704927">my 11 yr old and I are in night owl mode atm.<br/>
<br/>
just one of the things we did yesterday was go to the park (after stopping<br/>
at McD for breakfast- well our dinner). it was raining when we left then<br/>
stopped when we got to the park - very beautiful after a early morning<br/>
shower, just before the sunrise. Near the riverbed we found a couple of<br/>
fossils, got a wee muddy, skipped stones and joked around - dh was with us<br/>
and we had the park to ourselves. loved it!<br/>
When we were ready to go we stopped to look for 4-leaf clovers (I remember a<br/>
Bill Nye show where he could not find any, was a long time ago, I think he<br/>
said they did not exist - if I remember correctly, it was the episode where<br/>
he was talking about the paranormal) we found about 10, lol<br/>
ds rolled around the wet grass for a bit (very glad it was pretty warm out,<br/>
it was about 9am by then)<br/>
dh and ds watched a couple of DS9 shows then ds read a strategy guide for<br/>
one of his games before nodding off.<br/>
<br/>
it was a good day ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752170261">Just wanted to reply and let you know you&#39;re not alone. My ds is 15 and  loves to stay up all night and sleep during the day. I work four days a  week so I try to get him to sleep at night and be up during the day so  I can spend more time with him on my days off but he gradually starts  staying up later and later until he&#39;s back up all night. He plays Guild  Wars on the computer and talks to his friends with his headset. That&#39;s  his social outlet. Otherwise he&#39;s pretty much a homebody. It&#39;ll be  interesting to see what happens when he turns 16 and wants a job. He&#39;ll  have to be up during the day then. Minors can&#39;t work past 10 pm here on  the weeknights, and midnight on the weekends. If you&#39;d like to chat  more you can e-mail me privately anytime. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you manage something different? Can you switch YOUR schedule to  <br/>
suit his? Can you take a long nap one day so that you can be up  <br/>
during the night with him?<br/>
<br/>
It might also be that you have to face a fact of life that he might  <br/>
prefer his time online with his friends than additional time with  <br/>
you. That isn&#39;t so much a reflection of his relationship with you as  <br/>
the reality that he&#39;s emotionally getting ready to be more  <br/>
independent. Be sure that you don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He plays Guild  Wars on the computer and talks to his friends with  <br/>
&gt; his headset. That&#39;s  his social outlet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My now-18 year old did the same thing - not Guild Wars, but online  <br/>
role-playing games - all her friends were online ones. She did  <br/>
theater activities (in real life) but didn&#39;t develop a social life  <br/>
through that. In the past year, she&#39;s made an effort to meet some of  <br/>
her online friends, in person - and that has been very cool. She&#39;s  <br/>
also made a large group of really good in-person friends (it has to  <br/>
do with her getting old enough to be able to hang out with the  <br/>
college-age kids) and she&#39;s turned into a social butterfly - stays  <br/>
out late, spends the night at friends&#39; houses, has dates, goes to  <br/>
clubs and goes dancing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Otherwise he&#39;s pretty much a homebody. It&#39;ll be  interesting to see  <br/>
&gt; what happens when he turns 16 and wants a job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a non-issue --- my three stay-up-all-night kids have had no  <br/>
problem at all getting up for jobs or other activities that they&#39;ve  <br/>
chosen to do in the mornings. I&#39;ve known dozens of teen unschoolers  <br/>
who spent their nights online or out socializing - they&#39;ve all been  <br/>
able to adjust, easily, to early morning schedules, when they wanted  <br/>
to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;ll  have to be up during the day then. Minors can&#39;t work past 10  <br/>
&gt; pm here on  the weeknights, and midnight on the weekends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if he got a full-time job, he might get one where he works at  <br/>
from 1 pm to 10 pm on weekdays. He could still sleep until noon. And  <br/>
he&#39;s probably NOT going to want to work full time, right?  So he  <br/>
might work more like 6 pm to 10 pm - most jobs for teenagers are  <br/>
things like video stores or fast food or other retail jobs - those  <br/>
are more likely to be in the evenings, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There is some good scientific information about teens and sleep on  <br/>
the National Home Education Network website - look in the  <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling Help&quot; menu at the top and select &quot;High School and  <br/>
Beyond.&quot; Page way down to the sleep information.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>12 yo ds has been a 3am to bed and noontime or so riser for the past year.<br/>
I&#39;ve done my best to adjust my schedule to meet his needs, though I have to<br/>
say that dh and I have worked together on this one. Of late I have been<br/>
doing some work outside our home and am gone for a part of the afternoon. So<br/>
dh has been meeting his needs in the afternoon and I do night time things<br/>
with him, since I can stay up later than dh is able to. The other night, a<br/>
Tuesday night I believe, ds and I went to see a 10:30 showing of RV. It was<br/>
a blast! Only a few curious looks :o)<br/>
<br/>
17 yo ds has been a night time guy his whole life. 16 yo ds varies. 14 yo dd<br/>
is to bed by 10 and up by 7:30 like clockwork. She appears to be the anomaly<br/>
in our family! And lately, she has been up in the middle of the night, so<br/>
maybe that is changing.<br/>
<br/>
Two of them have had jobs, and they performed responsibilities just<br/>
fine...no problems with that. The jobs were sought by them and they wanted<br/>
to do them well. I can remember one time for each of them when they were<br/>
sleep-deprived on the job...they learned they didn&#39;t like it...a true<br/>
inspiration for figuring out how to not let it happen. It only took once.<br/>
<br/>
On my own I would probably be in bed around 11 and up around 7...but not so<br/>
much in this time of our lives. I want to adjust my schedule to theirs...I<br/>
am enjoying them while they are here.<br/>

We&#39;ve been to some late-night movies, and out to restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to go and practice driving the other night.  At 10:00  <br/>
Sunday night we found a big empty parking lot and I let her drive as  <br/>
much as she wanted to.  We had nice talks, and I noticed that, just  <br/>
as with her unicycle, she seemed much to prefer to turn left.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865591057">Many of you may remember me posting about getting our first horse a year and<br/>
a half ago after attending the Live and Learn Conference in MA and<br/>
participating in Barbara Sher&#39;s workshop.  It seemed like such an impossible<br/>
dream at the time but I was able to look at the reality of what stood<br/>
between us and our dream of horse ownership, then I was able to address<br/>
those issues and make it happen.  It was the beginning of a wonderful<br/>
journey for us~ an incredible learning/loving experience.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if I wrote about the purchase or our second horse last summer,<br/>
but Leigh, my 11 yo dd, took ownership of Sugar, our first horse, and we<br/>
purchased a second horse for Lilly (8 at the time) named Snickers.<br/>
Unfortunately, over the next few months we came to the realization that<br/>
Snickers just wasn&#39;t going to work out.  (she bucked and spooked and spun<br/>
and was just too much horse for Lilly once she got in shape) We ended up<br/>
putting her up for sale last fall.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In January, someone came to look at her.  We explained the problems we were<br/>
having with her. She asked us if we had found an appropriate mount for Lilly<br/>
yet.  We told her no we hadn&#39;t.  She offered us a trade.our mare for her<br/>
older gelding.  We went to meet Skippy and try him out and even though we<br/>
weren&#39;t positive that he would work out, we felt good about the trade<br/>
because he was at least a safe horse that we felt we could work with and if<br/>
not, we knew we could sell him more easily because he didn&#39;t buck or take<br/>
off on you, he was only a bit on the quick side and a little nervous.  And<br/>
we knew that Snickers was going to a good knowledgeable home where they<br/>
could handle her issues.  It was almost too good to be true.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Skippy is working out working out really well and we love him a lot!<br/>
A couple months ago we tossed around the idea of building a small barn and<br/>
riding arena at home and in the end we decided to do it.  (it&#39;s always scary<br/>
going further into debt but in this case, it&#39;s a win-win situation for us.<br/>
Our barn loan payment will about equal our board payments and it&#39;ll increase<br/>
the value of our property to boot.)  I finally feel like I know enough about<br/>
horses to care for them ourselves (it&#39;s amazing what hands on experience<br/>
will do for you) and I feel very comfortable with handling both of our<br/>
horses and their quirks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The wonderful and latest news is that our barn is almost finished!  Our<br/>
fencing is all up and in about a week our horses will be coming to live at<br/>
home.  Because we won&#39;t be working at the boarding barn anymore (we shovel<br/>
stalls and water 16+- horses 7 days a week most weeks in exchange for part<br/>
of our board) we will have a lot more time to enjoy our own horses.  We&#39;ll<br/>
be able to look out our windows and see our favorite furry friends at any<br/>
time of the day or night.  We&#39;ll have a lot more time to just enjoy them and<br/>
hang out with them and we are really excited!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our last name begins with an S and our horses&#39; names both begin with an S<br/>
and so we decided to name our farm &quot;Big S Farm.&quot;  Say that three times fast!<br/>
LOL! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I made a blog to show some pictures of our new barn if you want to check it<br/>
out.  www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/">http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199783181">The subject header, &quot;unschooling horses,&quot; made me think.  Horses have <br/>
to be schooled frequently; in fact, every time they are ridden, they <br/>
are being schooled, for better or worse.  Most people know horses will <br/>
walk off and graze if an inexperienced rider lets them, for instance.  <br/>
The term &quot;unschooled&quot; is a bad thing when applied to horses.  We human <br/>
unschoolers make it mean something new.  Ah, the beauty of an evolving <br/>
language!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
I actually finally got a hold of the vet that does acupuncture and<br/>
chiropractic and she said to wait till she gets a chance to see him.  Good<br/>
advice.   I don&#39;t actually think he has &#39;sore&#39; knees but I do think that<br/>
maybe something in his shoulder is out of whack and it does need to be<br/>
addressed.  It&#39;s sometimes hard to make these judgment calls when you see<br/>
the horse going and he seems so sound.  His stumbles sometimes kind of out<br/>
of the blue and I wasn&#39;t sure at first if it was just him or if he had<br/>
something going on.  I finally wrote in to a horse list, after talking in<br/>
person about it to everyone I know and I think I figured it out.  A couple<br/>
months ago he fell on some ice and now that I think back, that was about the<br/>
time he started stumbling.   I am so anxious for the vet to come and work on<br/>
him.  She has done wonders with other horses that I know personally,<br/>
including our mare when her pelvis was out last year.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do think language is a funny thing and I thought about that when I wrote<br/>
Unschooling horses as the title...<br/>

Angela ~ very excited to see the barn coming along<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033729391">Hello Angela,<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new here and not even sure if I ever intro. myself. I just wanted <br/>
to respond to you about your adventures with horses. (I&#39;m Nancy, Mom to 21 yo <br/>
ds, living out on his own and unschooling Mom to 2 dd&#39;s, 11 & 12)<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on your horses, barn, pasture AND arena! Your barn looks awesome! <br/>
Love your horses too! Lots of work, eh? (Been there done that! :o) But oh SO <br/>
worth it! There is nothing like looking out your window and seeing your own <br/>
horses in your own back yard. I was raised with horses until I moved out of the <br/>
house and always missed them in my life. (I lived and breathed horses, animals <br/>
and art as a kid and still do &lt;g&gt;) We just moved to a small farm (about 3 yrs. <br/>
ago) to do the same thing you are and I&#39;m here to say, it never goes out of <br/>
your system! We were fortunate enough to have 2 barns already here when we moved <br/>
in. One is a huge 3 story, beautiful, 100 yr. old hay barn and it&#39;s attached <br/>
to our home! (part of the house is actually in the barn and we plan on adding <br/>
more &quot;some day&quot;) Sort of different but, we like it. When we first moved in, my <br/>
neighbor told me that she just knew someone &quot;a little different&quot; would move <br/>
into it! (I took that as a compliment &lt;g&gt;) She is an UNschooler too! What are <br/>
the odds! Our animals stay out back in the pole barn though. :o) We had to build <br/>
stalls, a &quot;run in&quot; and put up a pasture too our first year here. This summer <br/>
we are going to put up another pasture so we can graze them. The work is never <br/>
ending but it&#39;s a fun work!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing!<br/>

on line.  Social life is limited for my 15 yr. old son but he does<br/>
communicate with others on Halo2 on line, and of course, AIM.  When I<br/>
realised that this was his major social outlet, my ideas about video<br/>
games changed drastically.  Does anyone know of a way for home school<br/>
late night gamers could IM or something without me worrying who he&#39;s<br/>

Anyway, I&#39;ve thought about depression (DS was dx&#39;d w/depression, GAD<br/>
and all sorts of anxiety stuff), too, but if he is maybe staying up<br/>
late and sleeping late will help him out, help him heal, rather than<br/>
trying to force &quot;life&quot; on him.  In the meantime, although staying up<br/>
late is a good option for him. DH and I go to bed at the normal &quot;50<br/>
year olds&quot; time.  No other kids at home.  I figure it&#39;s DS alone time<br/>
since we hang together from the time he gets up at around noon until<br/>
10 or 11 pm.  Lucky for me, most days I work from home in the a.m. and<br/>
can adjust other commitment.</div>
