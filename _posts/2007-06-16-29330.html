<div id="ygrps-yiv-500118176">The kids and I saw a commercial for a show that is on CBS this fall in<br/>
the U.S.. (I&#39;m looking to see if its shown anywhere else but have not<br/>
found any info yet).  Its called Kid Nation.  Apparently, they put 40<br/>
kids ages 8-15 on an old mining town in New Mexico for 40 days. <br/>
Children only, no adults.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old was so excited to see the preview.  It will be fun to<br/>
see how the kids live, build their world and relate with each other. <br/>
I&#39;m sure we will have great conversations about the show when it starts.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link about it if hasn&#39;t heard of it yet..<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if I like the &quot;Gold Star&quot; thing (I think its just the<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; gold star thing) but I&#39;m sure my kids would like the $20,000<br/>
that each star is worth.. bwg<br/>
<br/>
It would be pretty neat to see an unschooled kid on there!</div>

OH lovely.<br/>
<br/>
#1, all-kid cameramen and directors?   uh, yeah....<br/>
<br/>
#2, imagine the legal liabilities.<br/>
<br/>
An empty mall somewhere would be WAY, way safer than an old mining  <br/>
town.  I&#39;m curious about where this town would be, a place with  <br/>
liveable buildings and not full of black widow spiders and rattle  <br/>
snakes (not to even start to think about splinters and rusty nails  <br/>
and cactus and mine shafts...<br/>
<br/>
We camp in situations in which we have to take our own water.  &quot;An  <br/>
old mining town&quot; isn&#39;t likely to have a water system.  Porta  <br/>
potties ? Cleaned how often?<br/>
<br/>

Maybe you will. When they were recruiting for the show in December they <br/>
contacted some unschooling parents and group representatives who&#39;d been quoted in <br/>
newspaper articles last year. I don&#39;t know if anyone bit on it or not, I didn&#39;t <br/>
hear much excitement. I think most parents distrusted the motives of <br/>
strangers wanting to take their kids off to the desert alone.   :)   <br/>
