<div id="ygrps-yiv-549055469">The HSC conference in Sacramento was exhausting, but very fun.   I  <br/>
didn&#39;t take a camera.   If anyone here has photos in a public place I  <br/>
could see, that would be very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was there.  He ran a workshop on games based on history, and he  <br/>
was on a young adult homeschoolers&#39; panel.<br/>
<br/>
I did three talks and was on two panels.  (Hey, maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m  <br/>
so tired!)  They&#39;re for sale on CD, but I don&#39;t know the details yet  <br/>
(and anyone who does is welcome to put that here).<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian was there with Rose and Roxana.<br/>
<br/>
While we were there, we went to see Stardust, which was highly  <br/>
recommended by Marty (and others).<br/>
When Keith, Holly and Marty picked me and Kirby up at the airport,  <br/>
they had the plan to go see Stardust.  Kirby had already promised a  <br/>
couple of friends he would meet with them (separately, at different  <br/>
times), so we picked our friend Bo up when he got off work (same time  <br/>
as our flight and not far from there), went to Dion&#39;s, took Kirby  <br/>
home, and went to see Stardust.<br/>
<br/>
Today I will put up a new page which isn&#39;t there yet containing the  <br/>
questions asked on paper at the unschooling panel.  We only got to  <br/>
about half of them.  And the other panelists will be contacted so  <br/>
they can write answers to any that interest them particularly, if  <br/>
they want to.   So the conference isn&#39;t over for me yet.  Oh! and  <br/>
then there&#39;s laundry and paper and such--sorting the games out and  <br/>
deciding which go with Kirby to Texas tomorrow and which stay here.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby to Texas tomorrow...<br/>
