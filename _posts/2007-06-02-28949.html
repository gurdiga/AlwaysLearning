<br/>
I need some views on hip-hop and 8 yo girls.  My daughters want me to buy<br/>
some for them.  I¹m thinking that¹s what I should do.  They¹re not<br/>
interested in any particular group, they mostly want dance music (they love<br/>
the show ³so you think you can dance² ).  Part of me wants to ³protect² them<br/>
from it.... gawd... even as I write this it feels so false and ridiculous.<br/>
I¹m thinking that the whole ³nasty hip-hop² theme is similar to gaming and<br/>
unlimited TV.... hmmm... I guess just placing the question on paper is<br/>
prompting all sorts of discussions in my mind.  So with that I¹m guessing<br/>
that getting them what they want will at one point spark very interesting<br/>
conversations about misogyny, the use of swear words, perhaps a whole<br/>
digging into the hip-hop culture.....<br/>
<br/>
perhaps true protection comes with knowledge and free choice.<br/>
<br/>
Any views would be helpful though.  Perhaps I¹m not seeing something I need<br/>
to be looking at.<br/>

You&#39;re composing mail in Word or something first, I think.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know about others, but in my e-mail the apostrophes and quotation  <br/>
marks are all turned to numbers.  If you change to straight quotes in  <br/>
your word processing or if you compose in the e-mail I think it will  <br/>
be better for purposes of this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was an article in a recent National Geographic about the  <br/>
history of hip-hop that was really interesting.  http:// <br/>
www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0704/feature4/index.html<br/>
<br/>
Marty listens to it but he&#39;s still asleep so I can&#39;t ask him for a  <br/>
recommendation, but maybe Britney Spears?  Boy groups from the 90&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a movie they might enjoy, Josie and the Pussycats.  Not  <br/>
exactly hip hop, but might distract and amuse them and give them  <br/>
something to dance to.  And there&#39;s a Spice Girls movie.<br/>

I¹ve seen this happen before.  I do compose right in the email and I do use<br/>
straight quotes.  See, like now... when I hit reply and your response sits<br/>
below what I¹m writing now the quotes are just fine.  I¹ll bet if I send it<br/>
the  quotes will turn to numbers again... I¹ll have to ask a mac geek for<br/>
help.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links and movies.  I didn¹t know Britney Spears was hip-hop.<br/>
A friend of ours gave me a few CD¹s today, but I don¹t know who they are<br/>
except that they are male groups and pretty raunchy to my ears.  As I shed<br/>
old convictions I still find myself confused on some things.  The<br/>
unschooling lifestyle comes naturally to my girls.  I¹m the one who needs<br/>
deschooling, not them.  What a challenge it is and I must say enlightening<br/>
as well.  This is one of the issues I¹m confused about.  I listen to what<br/>
this friend gave me and I think..omg... should I let them listen to that?<br/>
Then I think about finding hip-hop that empowers women but isn¹t that like<br/>
sneaking spinach into brownies?  Or am I going off the deep end???  I¹m not<br/>
asking anybody to answer for me, just stating what¹s going through my mind<br/>
as I try and clear the clutter away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642501302">I don&#39;t know anything about hiphop. Really wasn&#39;t a music genre I explored <br/>
much, I have a few Beastie Boys cds and probably some other stuff, but it <br/>
was a very glancing blow. Anyhow, I went to youtube and put hiphop in and <br/>
found this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_MgxLLf7dA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_MgxLLf7dA</a> which has really fun <br/>
dancing. I really liked the group from Trinidad and Tobago, the music was <br/>
very different.<br/>
<br/>
I went to CDbaby.com and clicked on hiphop/rap. I listened briefly to <br/>
Caveman Theory&#39;s song Cracker Box Living (maybe because of my childhood love <br/>
of Pete Seeger&#39;s Little Boxes?). But you and your girls could listen through <br/>
some of the songs over there and see which style of hiphop most appeals.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527390984">I think it&#39;s important to make a distinction between corporate-driven hip-hop (which does tend to be really offensive, cuz that&#39;s what the record companies think will sell) and the many hip-hop artists out there who rap with a social conscience.  there are lots of them!  And sure, there might be objectionable language, but it&#39;s not the sexist, woman-hating stuff that people think all hip-hop is about.  <br/>
   <br/>
  A google search for socially conscious hip hop or feminist hip hop brought up lots of artists you might be interested in.  It is possible to rap and do hip hop without being racist and denigrating women.<br/>
   <br/>
  There&#39;s A Tribe Called Quest, Common, Mos Def, The Coup, Nas, and many others.<br/>
   <br/>
  Of course, if you also object to lots of swearing, then you might have a more difficult time.  I never had a problem with strong language around my kids (I cuss like a sailor myself), but I understand that other parents do.  I myself never censored my daughters&#39; music--and when my oldest was a teenager she really stretched the limits of my tolerance!  Honestly, I had more problem with the extreme death metal she listened to for a while than with any of the rap or hip hop.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;  some for them. I¹m thinking that¹s what I should do. They¹re not<br/>
&gt;  interested in any particular group, they mostly want dance music (they love<br/>
&gt;  the show ³so you think you can dance² ). Part of me wants to ³protect² them<br/>
&gt;  from it.... gawd... even as I write this it feels so false and ridiculous.<br/>
&gt;  I¹m thinking that the whole ³nasty hip-hop² theme is similar to gaming and<br/>
&gt;  unlimited TV.... hmmm... I guess just placing the question on paper is<br/>
&gt;  prompting all sorts of discussions in my mind. So with that I¹m guessing<br/>
&gt;  that getting them what they want will at one point spark very interesting<br/>
&gt;  conversations about misogyny, the use of swear words, perhaps a whole<br/>
&gt;  digging into the hip-hop culture.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; perhaps true protection comes with knowledge and free choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any views would be helpful though. Perhaps I¹m not seeing something I need<br/>
&gt;  to be looking at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557690123">Yes the actor, he started out as a rapper, and has continued during his acting career.  He did the main songs for both Men in Black movies and for Wild Wild West.  In the beginning he was the Fresh Prince (and started acting doing The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, funny show if they like Will Smith, it is fun to see him as a much yournger guy) and he put out his first music as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Some of his early music is pretty corny, but very kid friendly.  One of his more popular songs back the was &quot;Parents Just Don&#39;t Understand.&quot;  Mainstream parenty, but funny for us to remember our parents!  His newer stuff is good, I think.  <br/>
My 11 year old listens to everything, from rap to rock.  He listens to the harder stuff that probably isn&#39;t appropriate by most people&#39;s standards, but we talk a lot about the lyrics and the history and the artists themselves.  One of our most recent discussions centered around Emenim and his relationship with his mother, and how bad parenting affects the kids even when they become adults.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53185227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I think it&#39;s important to make a distinction between corporate-driven<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hip-hop (which does tend to be really offensive, cuz &gt;&gt;that&#39;s what the<br/>
record companies think will sell) and the many hip-hop artists out there who<br/>
rap with a social conscience. &gt;&gt;there are lots of them!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I was just typing a similar post when this came in. Not about<br/>
corporate-driven music, but about the meaning of this art form. What I find<br/>
interesting about Hip Hop is that it often seems an artistic response to<br/>
urban pain and suffering, and when I have really listened to the lyrics and<br/>
what the artist is saying, I have gained some tremendous insight to things<br/>
that I have had no real experience with. I think it can be the same for our<br/>
kids. Last week we were in the car and Andrew put a rap/hip-hop station on<br/>
the radio, and this piece came on with lots of tough talk, but within that<br/>
was the message that he felt useless, that his dad left when he was born and<br/>
his mom made him feel like &quot;nothin&#39;&quot;, and he just didn&#39;t see the point in<br/>
life. I know I was crying!!<br/>
<br/>
It seems somewhat like a cultural thing to me, the language and talk of<br/>
violence and such...another way of life for some people. Not to say that<br/>
anyone who lives an urban life swears and is violent...not by a long shot.<br/>
But the reality is that there are some really rough parts of life, and some<br/>
really rough places to live, and singing or rapping or hip hopping about<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t look pretty if they&#39;re keeping it real. And I really<br/>
appreciate that.<br/>

She&#39;s been dancing since she was very little.<br/>

When hip hop came into the mix in dance years ago, we white middle-class<br/>
mommas were a little taken aback...<br/>
<br/>
But in the end the same principles apply: trust, be open, discuss, listen<br/>
and allow freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah is turning 15 this month and is a pretty dang good hip hopper! But<br/>
she doesn&#39;t swear (too much) or show signs of violent behavior. And she<br/>
*gets* where it came from, and loves to act &quot;bad ass&quot; as she puts it...if<br/>
only for a dance or two. I would say hip hop has expanded her world.<br/>

Interesting question.  Actually Greek hip-hop is taking off here as well and<br/>
the show So You Think You Can Dance is all Greek with all Greek dancers and<br/>
most of the dancing is hip-hop.<br/>
<br/>
What they do get subjected to is our lifestyle.  People freak because I let<br/>
them wear make-up and paint their nails.  They only do it maybe 3 times per<br/>
year, but to the villagers it does seem to be a memorable occasion.  People<br/>
here think we&#39;re &quot;destroying&quot; our girls by not sending them to school.<br/>
Unschooling here is as known and accepted as it was 40 years ago in the US.<br/>
<br/>
We get lots of other peoples&#39; opinions unsolicited.<br/>

  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with trying to seek out the best for your girls.  That doesn&#39;t mean you have to forbid other rap music, but if socially conscience rap is available (and just as good, some of it better in some cases IMHO) then why not present it to them.  They might prefer it as well.  You won&#39;t know until you expose them to it.  A lot of the rap of the 80&#39;s is much more socially aware and has less of the bump and grind element.  A lot of it does have to do with drugs and appalling living conditions, but that could open up some interesting discussions.<br/>
   <br/>
  Chuck D (formerly of Public Enemy) is a rapper with an environmental and political conscience.  Although, he does swear a lot &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  Kanye West and Common also have positive messages.<br/>
   <br/>
  Daara J is a rap group from Dakar in Senegal has a social conscience.  Their album is called, &quot;Global Hip Hop: Beats and Rhymes--The Nu World Culture&quot;.  You&#39;d probably find it in the world music section.<br/>
   <br/>
  Afrika Bambaataa was one of the first rappers to put politics in his music (he sampled Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Malcom X in songs).  He was around in the 80&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s done anything current.<br/>
   <br/>
  It would also be worth checking out some of the female rap artists like Queen Latifah (most of her rap was from &#39;88 to &#39;98).  I don&#39;t really know much about other female rap artists.<br/>
   <br/>
  I would say, let this be an adventure and learning experience for all of you.  Try it out, if something you listen to is offensive to you, tell your girls that and explain why it offends you.  Again this could open doors to some amazing discussions and growth.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Have fun with it,<br/>
