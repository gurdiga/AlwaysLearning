<div id="ygrps-yiv-59364167">Hubby and I are working on doing the same thing as Heather and her husband.<br/>
I started my business so that I didn&#39;t have to dump my kids in daycare...<br/>
Hubby quit a full-time salaried with benefits job to work on a contract<br/>
basis to get used to the idea of being self-employed.  My business is<br/>
getting to the point where I can nearly sustain the entire family.  The next<br/>
step is moving to a bigger house (we won&#39;t qualify for the mortgage once he<br/>
quits his contract) and then he&#39;s going to quit and work with me in my<br/>
business.  I&#39;m working on a contract for a syndicated radio show so I&#39;ll<br/>
need him to help with tons of things.  That way we&#39;ll both be home with the<br/>
kids and I&#39;ll work from the studio in my home.  It&#39;s just taken<br/>
perserverance (sp) and as desire to have the life the way we want it.<br/>
<br/>

PS  Heather and I do a swap with our kids usually once a week.  I have her 2<br/>
for a playdate and the next week she has mine.  The kids all get along<br/>
really well thank goodness so this has been a wonderful blessing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Wow! How did you manage your situation so none of the adults in the family<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have to leave the home in<br/>
<br/>
order to earn the income needed to support the family?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago my dh wrote some software as a hobby while he taught<br/>
himself how to trade futures & options. He turned his hobby into his own<br/>
business. We saved up so he could quit his job to try and make it work. We<br/>
decided we could survive 3 years on our savings if we had to. He quit about<br/>
a year & a half ago and business is growing. People subscribe to hiswebsite<br/>
on a monthly or yearly basis. He works from home, mostly making additions<br/>
and corrections to the website, maybe 8-12 hours a week. He considers his<br/>
move to self-employment part of his de-schooling process.<br/>

p.s. he is trained as an electrical engineer and his former job was writing<br/>
algorithyms (sp) for TI calculators.<br/>
