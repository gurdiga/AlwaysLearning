<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209809702">Nothing about Halo2-Something about Wolves.<br/>
I saw my first wild wolf a few miles from home two weeks ago-Just  two seconds as it leaped off of a high snowy bank and leaped onto the other and out. It was night so it was just at the edge of my low beams. It was a very light grey color.<br/>
I was just  delighted.<br/>
They have been coming into our area more and more in the last 7-8 years. My adult boys have seen them as they are out  in the bush  more  and  others see them fairly often in  our sparsely populated  area.<br/>
There is a small &quot;wolf centre&quot;  a few miles away  where they  keep  a few in a big  wooded compound but after being there once i won&#39;t go again. If it isn&#39;t out in the wilderness I just feel badly.The people who run it are knowledgable and take  one or more to the schools etc and do talks for tourists there.<br/>
Your son would enjoy it though.<br/>
Right now I happen to be reading  Shadow Mountain&quot; by Renee Askins. She is a wildlife biologist who words on introducing wolves into Yellowstone Park (among other projects), A good read.<br/>
We  unschool  our twin ggd,s  in the  East Kootenays, of BC Canada. between Banff National Park and Yoho and glacier Nat. Park.<br/>
Hope your son gets to see a wolf in the wild someday-it is a rare privelage.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply">   ----- Original Message ----- If anyone is interested in wolves, we found an interesting site:<br/>
  International Wolf Center  www.wolf.org very cool, it has 3 cameras that<br/>
  they refresh every minute to see the wolves on the compound. We adopted one<br/>
  of the older wolves, so our son is very excited about that. All I know about<br/>
  the facility is what is on the website.<br/>
