<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850254772">This came by e-mail.  I&#39;m deleting just a few bits to make it more  <br/>
generic.  My responses are routine.  I&#39;ve brought it here because  <br/>
there might be new list members with some of the same questions, and  <br/>
something in here might help.  For those who&#39;ve been reading a longer  <br/>
time and are more confident, it might not be worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
The gist of it has to do with clarity of concept and language, I think.<br/>

<br/>
Is  unschooling  all  about  making  time  to  play  with  child .   <br/>
Mine  is  10  and  still  doesnt  want  to  go  to  school  and She  <br/>
sometimes  wants  to    but   She  wants  to  play  all  the  time.   <br/>
So  I  ALLOW  HER  TO  DO  so  and  I  cant  all  the  time  because   <br/>
if  shes  not  going  to  do  chores  then  they  all  fall  on  me   <br/>
I  HAVE  TO  GET  THEM  DONE  and  I  cant  play  with  her  .  shes   <br/>
an  only  child  and  I  am  a  single  mom  unschooling  .  It  is   <br/>
really  difficult  to  get  her  to  do  things  when  I  want  her   <br/>
to  get  them  done.  I am  talking  about  chores  mostly  .  so   <br/>
then  I have  to  do  them  all  and  dont  have  time  with  her  .   <br/>
time  with  her  gives  me  joy  and  her  too.  Can  I  ask  what   <br/>
do  other  unschoolers  do   when  the  public  school  and  state   <br/>
law  forces  them  to  take  the  standarized  testings  they  are   <br/>
mandatory    here  in  this  state.  I  know  my  child  will  fail   <br/>
the testings  because  she  is  behind  way  behind  like  shes   a   <br/>
first  grade  level  in  math  and  not  even  that  mentally  I   <br/>
mean  she  can  not  do  math  mentally  so  we  dont  do  it  at   <br/>
all  except  for  baking  cookies.  but  when   the  testings  come   <br/>
she  wont  pass  .  I  worry  because  then  they  will  make  her   <br/>
take  more  tests  that  will  proove  she  has  learning  problems   <br/>
and  then  they  will  force  learning  specialists  because  the   <br/>
state  says  we  have  to  have  a  team  .  I  dont  want  a  team   <br/>
of  teachers  with  me  .  I  am  the  parent  and  I  dont  teach   <br/>
and  I  want  to  continue  unschooling  with  out  the  schools   <br/>
interference  but   THIS  IS  GOING  TO  BE  VERY  DIFFICULT  UNLESS   <br/>
I  LYE  ABOUT  WAHT  GRADE  SHES  IN  SO  SHE  DOESNT  HAVE  TO  TAKE   <br/>
THE  TESTS  AT  ALL  AND  SKIP  TO  5TH GRADE SO  SHE  WONT  HAVE  TO   <br/>
TAKE  THE  4TH  GRADE  TEST.  THEN  WHAT  DO  I  DO  AFTER  THE  6TH   <br/>
GRADE  AND  8TH  GRADES  WHEN  SHE  NEEDS  A  TEST  AGAIN  .    AND   <br/>
10TH  .  It  is  the  law  they  have  to  know  where  shes  at  .   <br/>
If  I  say  shes  in  [whatever]  grade  and  she  still  doesnt   <br/>
know  here  multiplication  tables  they  will  force  me  to   <br/>
meetings  I  WILL  ignore  but  I  might  get  introuble  with   <br/>
social  services   if  I  dont  comply  with  their  meetings   and   <br/>
grading  my  daughter  and  testing  her.  I  DONT  TEST  HER  NOW   <br/>
AND  DONT  BELIEVE  IN  TESTING  I  really  want  to  know  if  any   <br/>
one  has  ever  avoided  the  testings  and  how  have  they  done    <br/>
that  .    or  do  they  just  take  the  tests  and  not  even   <br/>
worry  what  the  childs  score  is  and  if  they  want  to  file   <br/>
it  away  let  them  if  its  law  and  I  can  throw  it  in  the   <br/>
trash  .  because  it  means  nothing  to  us  except  competition   <br/>
within  th  nation  nationally  amongst   children    thank  you  for   <br/>
listening  and  plaese  give  me  some  names  and  email     <br/>
addresses  to  talk  to  or  suggestions<br/>

  Whatever state it is, please look here and join a local list and ask  <br/>
them what they actually do, or if they&#39;ve found workarounds.<br/>

<br/>
Or what?  What if you don&#39;t &quot;GET THEM DONE&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Be very careful with &quot;have to.&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s really important.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It  is  really  difficult  to  get  her  to  do  things  when  I   <br/>
want  her  to  get  them  done. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It takes more time to do really difficult or impossible things than it  <br/>
does to play with a child.<br/>

<br/>
-=- state  law  forces  them  to  take  the  standarized  testings   <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Force&quot; is not the same as &quot;requirement.&quot;  &quot;Force&quot; has to do with  <br/>
physical threat and manhandling and shoving and pushing.<br/>
<br/>
Your writing seemed full of fear of threat and fear of fear.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what others in your state do.  Be peaceful and sweet with  <br/>
your daughter, above all.  Make her life interesting.  And sometimes  <br/>
play with her.  More than you want to, and a little more than you  <br/>
think you can.  It will work out better that way.  Before long it  <br/>
won&#39;t be more than you want to.<br/>

&gt; Mine is 10 and still doesnt want to go to school and She<br/>
&gt; sometimes wants to but She wants to play all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then she should play.  Find play in everything you do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I ALLOW HER TO DO so and I cant all the time because<br/>
&gt; if shes not going to do chores then they all fall on me<br/>
&gt; I HAVE TO GET THEM DONE and I cant play with her . shes<br/>
&gt; an only child and I am a single mom unschooling . It is<br/>
&gt; really difficult to get her to do things when I want her<br/>
&gt; to get them done. I am talking about chores mostly .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a kitchen full of dirty dishes because I spent the day at the<br/>
park yesterday and did other things with and for my kids.  My floors<br/>
desperately need to be vacuumed.  I will get some of it done today, but<br/>
I&#39;m not stressing over it, other than the discomfort it causes me, which<br/>
I&#39;m letting go.  I still haven&#39;t cleaned the bathroom after cleaning the<br/>
dog, but we do have 2 bathrooms, that was 2 days ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a single mom, but I have 2 times the amount of people in my<br/>
house, so double the messes, and I&#39;m still the main household cleaner<br/>
and comfort maker.  Some people have really high standards for<br/>
cleanliness and try to raise kids with that standard, but neglect the<br/>
rest of what children need.  Kids, as well as adults like some level of<br/>
creature comforts, but they also need to feel like they can be mentally<br/>
comfortable in their environment.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent constantly trumps mental comfort for physical comfort, in<br/>
the form of a neat and tidy house, the children will look elsewhere for<br/>
mental comfort.  Sure there&#39;s a balance there.  A parent shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
trying to get a kid to do whatever it is the parent wants when the<br/>
parent wants.  Asking for help is great, working with a child&#39;s time<br/>
frame is great, doing things together is great.  If it&#39;s not going to be<br/>
peacable and pleasant doing it together or having a child do it, then do<br/>
it differently.  Do it for her kindly because you want a certain level<br/>
of comfort for yourself and her.<br/>
<br/>
I know my child will fail<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the testings because she is behind way behind like shes a<br/>
&gt; first grade level in math and not even that mentally I<br/>
&gt; mean she can not do math mentally so we dont do it at<br/>
&gt; all except for baking cookies. but when the testings come<br/>
&gt; she wont pass .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you know she won&#39;t pass?  What is passing?  Where I live you need<br/>
to be in the 15th percentile to be considered passing, and even if you<br/>
don&#39;t make even that very low minimum, you have a year to make progress<br/>
and get a better score, and if you still don&#39;t make a better score, you<br/>
still have options other than special ed or school.  I know it&#39;s<br/>
different in every area, but the way you describe it, has been described<br/>
in my area by newer homeschoolers who are afraid, even though there are<br/>
good reasons not to be.  It really does help to know the laws where you<br/>
live.</div>

<br/>
Song for a Fifth Child.<br/>
<br/>
Mother, O Mother, come shake out your cloth,<br/>
Empty the dustpan, poison the moth,<br/>
Hang out the washing, make up the bed,<br/>
Sew on a button and butter the bread.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the mother whose house is so shocking?<br/>
She&#39;s up in the nursery, blissfully rocking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve grown as shiftless as Little Boy Blue,<br/>
Lullabye, rockabye, lullabye loo.<br/>
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>
Pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo<br/>
<br/>
The shopping&#39;s not done and there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>
And out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>
But I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo<br/>
Look! Aren&#39;t his eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>
Lullabye, rockaby lullabye loo.<br/>
<br/>
The cleaning and scrubbing can wait till tomorrow<br/>
But children grow up as I&#39;ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>
So quiet down cobwebs; Dust go to sleep!<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby and babies don&#39;t keep.<br/>
