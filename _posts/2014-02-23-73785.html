<div id="ygrps-yiv-801143328">I saved this for over a week so it would be cold.  It&#39;s not by an unschooler, but by a mainstream parent commenting on a mutual facebook friend&#39;s wall.  I hope it will be (for everyone who reads it) an example of how far one can move away from what is acceptable mainstream parenting:<br/>

I always told my children that I never speculate about things that don&#39;t pertain to anything right here and now, but they were welcome to be philosophical all they wanted, as long as their rooms were clean & homework was done.<br/>
<br/>
My kids always wanted to have deep, philosophical conversations when there were &quot;boring&quot; things to be done, hahaha! Little smarties! <br/>

There was a book I had and read a couple of time when Marty was little, so 1989, 1990, by Gareth Matthews called Philosophy and the Young Child.<br/>

Marty was my example.  He&#39;s always been a deep thinkier, but in a light-hearted way.  Just last week he complained that his art history professor has no imagination.  If it&#39;s not in the book, she doesn&#39;t want to discuss it.  When he speculated, to a question about an Egyptian sculpture, that it might have been propaganda, she said &quot;No, all sculptures were approved.&quot;  To Marty (and to me, when he told me) that wasn&#39;t even NEARLY a decent answer. :-)   Just because a sculpture wasn&#39;t approved doesn&#39;t mean it was destroyed.  And there surely were practice things, goofs, private pieces.  But she doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks if they don&#39;t have a PhD.   Marty will never have that prejudice, and she&#39;s just given him cause to hesitate about listening just because someone DOES have one.<br/>
<br/>
In California last October when I was speaking at HSC&#39;s unschooling symposium, someone asked me to say what books I liked.  I kind of understood the question, but at the age of 60, I have read a LOT of books that influenced me.  And if another person were to read those same books, they wouldn&#39;t get the same messages or information I had, because I read them from my own curiosity and made my own connections as I was reading, and later.  The order of reading them probably mattered.  Being who I was, from where I was, with my moods probably mattered.<br/>
<br/>
So the book above might be great for some people, not interesting to others, might be the portal to a rest-of-life interest to someone.  <br/>
<br/>
I think putting a child&#39;s desire to speak of deep philosophical things should be put ahead of just about everything else, and never laughed at or belittled.<br/>
