<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798422987">Hi ren, or anyone else that feels like answering.<br/>
I would like to know if I can participate still on the typical days<br/>
blog carneval, or is it too late?<br/>
<br/>
and then Id like to know if I can blog from the RUN site ? or do I<br/>
need to start me own?<br/>
<br/>
Ive been really wanting to start one up for our family, but Im a<br/>
little worried about time issues--melissa of 7 in oklahoma tho seems<br/>
to manage...this give me encouragement!<br/>
<br/>
so lastly, which blogging system for a busy always being interrupted<br/>
mamma who is not perfectly computer savvy anymore, is simplest and<br/>
most straight forward?<br/>

There&#39;s a way you can get in on it kind of even if the deadline has  <br/>
passed.   You can leave a comment with a link at the August blogpost  <br/>
entry at the RUN site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-and then Id like to know if I can blog from the RUN site ? or do I  <br/>
need to start me own?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you have a RUN account, one of the links at the top of your page  <br/>
is Blog.  Tadaa!  You can blog there, and  new blogposts show in the  <br/>
righthand column.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Ive been really wanting to start one up for our family, but Im a  <br/>
little worried about time issues--melissa of 7 in oklahoma tho seems  <br/>
to manage...this give me encouragement!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some people use them almost exclusively for photos.   You could get  <br/>
your kids to help you maybe!  Some people only post once a month or  <br/>
so on their blogs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-so lastly, which blogging system for a busy always being interrupted<br/>
<br/>
mamma who is not perfectly computer savvy anymore, is simplest and<br/>
most straight forward?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogger.com">http://blogger.com</a> is easy.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a blogspot blog.  And if you&#39;re working on a post and  <br/>
you&#39;re not finished, just click &quot;save as draft&quot; and come back to it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337510019">My blog is also at the blogger.com service. I like it for the most<br/>
part. Easy to use and all.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a blogpost about &quot;typical days&quot; I could easily add it or<br/>
you could simply post the link in comments like Sandra suggested. I&#39;ve<br/>
already posted the September topic if you&#39;d like to check that out too!:) <br/>
<br/>
Blogging is so great for me because when I feel that we &quot;don&#39;t do<br/>
much&quot; I just look back over a month and feel much better. I lost the<br/>
worry about school subjects many years ago, but as a working Mom I do<br/>
worry sometimes about the kids getting enough of us as parents.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t get as much as some unschooled parents. But we have a lot<br/>
of fun and time together...much more than most families we know! My<br/>
blog helps me keep track of many sparkly moments and days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914085752">thanks sandra and ren,<br/>
we arent living &quot;normal&quot; days right now...or rather they are a bit<br/>
more intensely normal than usual, &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
if I can get a chance this week, I will give my best to get this<br/>
going: it was a goal for july and Im still here processing...<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I think you have said the best reason for me to actually do it:<br/>
<br/>

too little butter on a fat slice of bread...that a collection of<br/>
sparkly moments to look back on would be so nice.<br/>
<br/>
time to hang the camera around my neck...<br/>

oh, yes, a ps:  my dad recently sent me this in response to my<br/>
expressing an interest in starting a blog:<br/>

Message from sender:<br/>
This is a good article that makes it clear that making yourself<br/>
vulnerable to trolls by creating your own blog is probably a bad idea.<br/>

The Trolls Among Us<br/>
By MATTATHIAS SCHWARTZ<br/>
A growing subculture has a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty<br/>
much everyone else online.<br/>
<br/>
I cant get a link for you all: but have you ever heard of this? Ive<br/>
never heard anyone complaining...and I would think that writing on<br/>
forums etc pretty much inoculates one against such stuff, lol..<br/>

I have a stalker (maybe two)--someone who occasionally goes off in  <br/>
comments on my blog.  Sometimes I leave it, but a few times it has  <br/>
gotten bad.  I could&#39;ve just deleted the posts, but I saved them in  <br/>
case anyone in the future thinks they&#39;re the first to have heckled  <br/>
and that.  I just link them from the blog.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people cannot take criticism and they start a blog and  <br/>
then close it up.<br/>

to my blog (I was inspired by an unschooling dad who does it:<br/>
Kevinagogo.com)  -- blogger assigns a specific email address that goes<br/>
directly to the blog (either publish or draft); you can always go back and<br/>
add descriptions/reflections.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>when I started my blog I posted about world of warcraft and had this<br/>
heckler keep posting about how crazy I was- I figured that if I made it<br/>
harder to post it might turn dirty so I put the blog comments on<br/>
moderation which means all comments go to my e-mail first and then I can<br/>
choose to post or not post them- it is also helpful because I can see<br/>
which posts are getting comments and I would not have someone leaving<br/>
nasty stuff on older stuff<br/>
<br/>
I also went to statcounter.com and added that to the blog which keeps<br/>
track of which IP addresses visit your blog- I sort of mostly figured<br/>
out that it was a family member and they have mostly disappeared -<br/>
