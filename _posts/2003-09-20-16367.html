<br/>
I agree with Sandra.  I posted about Adriane and her gymnastics meets.  She<br/>
tends to freak herself out over them and somehow injure herself.  She has<br/>
brought on asthma prior to meets, missed landings on apparatus right before,<br/>
etc..  Never fails its something.  I have pointed out this pattern,<br/>
suggested perhaps the stress is a problem, asked if she wanted to quit the<br/>
team and just take classes, etc.  She is adamant that she wants to be on the<br/>
team.   OK.<br/>
<br/>
She is at a meet with her Dad right now.  I picked her up from class on<br/>
Thursday and she was grumpy.  I asked what was wrong and she began to cry.<br/>
Adriane is 12 by the way.  She had injured her foot and it was quite painful<br/>
and she was sure that she wouldn&#39;t do well in the meet.  She said &quot;everyone<br/>
says your&#39;e doing great but I know I&#39;m not.&quot;  And she cried and I hugged<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
After awhile I suggested that perhaps, in her mind, she should just ignore<br/>
the meets, ignore the competition, just do gymnastics because she loves it<br/>
and for no other reason than that.  It seemed to help and she was happy when<br/>
she went to bed that night.<br/>
