<div id="ygrps-yiv-881905533">This is a video of a moment in our evening together.<br/>
My 9 year old son read a book about cows to his 5 year old sister.<br/>
After a couple minutes I just grabbed my phone and recorded the scene as I thought I should have it<br/>
saved . It was very sweet.<br/>

<br/>
If you are new to unschooling or this list I want to point out that my son learn to read without teaching, classes , methods, pushing,<br/>
only by playing what he wanted to play and helping him when he wanted help and mostly by playing video games.<br/>
