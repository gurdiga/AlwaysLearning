<div id="ygrps-yiv-406107267">We finally got some snow here, we&#39;ve been waiting less than patiently.  <br/>
It started snowing Tuesday, cold and blowing and nasty and we just stayed<br/>
inside and watched movies all day.   Dylan likes the old monster movies<br/>
with special effects by Ray Harryhausen so we watched &quot;Jason and the<br/>
Argonauts&quot;  &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;  and &quot;Clash of the Titans.&quot;  <br/>
Wednesday was cold but not blowing so much and the snow was crisp and<br/>
powdery and beautiful so we went snowshoeing, just Dylan and I, out along<br/>
the river.   We followed fox tracks and then found the fox, hunting along<br/>
a fence line.   He saw us but didn&#39;t seem to care at all.   We watched<br/>
him for about half an hour before we noticed we were getting cold just<br/>
standing there.   He was beautiful.   <br/>
We had corn with us, just in case we saw a duck or two.  Some crazy ducks<br/>
stay the winter here and we spend our free time wondering if their big<br/>
duck feet are being frozen into the river ice.   We like to go out and<br/>
listen to the ice moving along the river and we like to feed the brave<br/>
ducks who don&#39;t mind cold Montana winters.   There was a small group of<br/>
seven Mallards and we tossed them corn while they swore at us and looked<br/>
at us suspiciously, but after we moved away a bit they came and ate.   I<br/>
later read that Mallards prefer sugar donuts,  (who wouldn&#39;t?)  so that<br/>
was the reason for the swearing I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday was much warmer and friends came over.   We built snowmen in the<br/>
front yard and had snow ball fights.   The big snowman looked a little<br/>
like Abe Lincoln, just by accident, and we were proud of our abilities<br/>
but while we were inside warming over hot chocolate and a game of Clue<br/>
(which I lost) his head fell off.  (We found no evidence he&#39;d been shot) <br/>
The replacement head looked a little like our current president and<br/>
lasted a little longer, too.   We made some repairs to his ears and nose<br/>
yesterday, but by last night he was done for.   Dylan said it was a<br/>
random act of sunlight violence.<br/>
<br/>
Friday we went sledding.   The snow was slick and fast and we crashed a<br/>
lot but it was fun and I have the sore rump to prove it.    <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s Dad was home on Saturday and we decided to make ice sculptures.  <br/>
We filled some rubber maid (sp) storage bins with water and left them out<br/>
to freeze,  but it didn&#39;t stay cold enough and we didn&#39;t get ice.  We did<br/>
make a snow dragon, slithering along the ground and bumping up here and<br/>
there until we ran out of snow.   <br/>
<br/>
I have been badly beaten at Master Labyrinth and Survival or Extinction<br/>
today.  <br/>
We went out to lunch and took a walk.  We made granola.  We made oatmeal<br/>
cookies.  Dylan had a karate class and when he came home my brother was<br/>
here with the ultrasound pictures of his little human bean sprout.<br/>
We&#39;re going to watch &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; tonight and I&#39;m so glad to<br/>
have such a cool kid to spend time with.  <br/>
