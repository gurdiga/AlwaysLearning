<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268256160">Dear Amy,<br/>
<br/>
Hearing more pertinent details does clarify the<br/>
picture.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that you were trying to be discreet, but the<br/>
post I responded to did not indicate an illiterate<br/>
mother and captive children.<br/>
<br/>
There are obviously control issues within that family.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
About 98% of Americans have televisions in their<br/>
homes. At least that&#39;s the statistic I&#39;ve heard often<br/>
quoted. That theirs is an environment so cut off from<br/>
the rest of the world and even simple children&#39;s books<br/>
are banned is quite an oddity.<br/>
<br/>
What can I say ...  The details paint a grim picture.<br/>
