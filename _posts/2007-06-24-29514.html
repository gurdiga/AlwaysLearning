<div id="ygrps-yiv-894921838">Some of you know and most of you don&#39;t, probably, about a page I have  <br/>
on the game Snakes and Ladders.   I&#39;ll put that link below, but  <br/>
someone found it who has created a 21st century version tying back to  <br/>
ancient myths and illustrating the fundamentals of commerce and  <br/>
management.  He wants to know if I could include it on my page.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I said yes, please!  I hope to have an image and some links t  <br/>
articles.  I&#39;m going to put the letter up with links to the stories  <br/>
and characters from Hindu mythology, too, if I can find good pages.   <br/>
This is very, very exciting to me.<br/>

dear sandra,<br/>
<br/>
  I am Dr K.P.Sastry  educator in Karimnagar found a novel way to  <br/>
unite love of board games.I created a new version of the popular game  <br/>
Snakes and Ladders (VYKUNTAPALI) that teaches the fundementals of  <br/>
commerce and management.I am working as reader in commerce at SRR  <br/>
government degree and PG college. I used snakes to represent upward  <br/>
trends and ladders to show downward trends in commerce.For example,  <br/>
population explosion is represented by a snake and brings players to  <br/>
poverty,whereas advertising,which leads to higher sales,is  <br/>
represented by a ladder.In this innovation chart, the basic concepts  <br/>
of 10 subjects,including accountancy,industrial organisation and  <br/>
management,marketing,stock exchange speculation and banking are  <br/>
illustrated using natural and mythological referencas,ranging from  <br/>
farms and animals to the stories of  ARTHNAREESWARA TATWAM and   <br/>
KSHEERASAGAR MATHANAM.for instance,NARADA (the one who monitors  <br/>
information among the three worlds or lokas) int the chart  <br/>
illustrates the importance of effective communication management.This  <br/>
game is basically a low cost teaching aid.My idea was to present the  <br/>
fundamentals of commerce pictorially in the form of a game.I worked  <br/>
on the idea by revising and improving on the original Snakes and  <br/>
Ladders game and symbolically incorporating concepts of commerce. The  <br/>
chart was appreciated by several newspapers and  UGC ETC.<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to  know that you are also very much interested in  <br/>
snakes and ladders games of the above type;   Now I request you to<br/>
inform me about the possibility of incorporating my chart also in  <br/>
your website.<br/>
<br/>
