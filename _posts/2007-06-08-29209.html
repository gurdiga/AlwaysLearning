<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080453891">-=-I think it says something pretty sad and significant that these stores <br/>
seem to be closing everywhere. We&#39;ve only been unschooling for three years, and <br/>
used to go to these kind of places, but now have to drive pretty far to find a <br/>
&quot;good&quot; teacher supply place. -=-<br/>
<br/>
**Teachers used to drive from all over New Mexico to Albuquerque to get <br/>
supplies, and now anyone anywhere can get more, better and less expensive stuff off <br/>
the internet.Â  It&#39;s sad for me because that was something familiar to me and <br/>
change can be sad and nostalgia can be sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Those places aren&#39;t needed the same way they once were.**<br/>
<br/>
In the past month I&#39;ve heard much the same conversation about art supply <br/>
stores, hobby/model shops, and several other things I&#39;m not recalling right now. <br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest thing that&#39;s been lost in this transition of much <br/>
commerce to online sales is some opportunity for kids to poke around and dabble in <br/>
new pursuits. In a physical store it&#39;s much easier to go in, look around at <br/>
everything, maybe plan a future purchase, and then leave with just a loose crayon <br/>
and two dice, or one small jar of model paint, or a new kneaded eraser. My <br/>
kids poke around a lot in online stores, but that one little purchase entry <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen because shipping costs would exceed the purchase price.<br/>
<br/>
As for the teacher supply stores, the online venues are SO much less <br/>
satisfying for unschoolers. The kids can&#39;t pick up the workbooks and leaf through them <br/>
to find the one in a hundred that isn&#39;t lame and boring, and it&#39;s so much <br/>
less interesting to look at the posters one screen at a time. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - while several older teacher supply stores have gone out <br/>
of business in the last decade in our corner of Chicagoland, there&#39;s a newer <br/>
one (5 years now) that is thriving and growing by adapting to what brings people <br/>
into a physical business instead of internet shopping. They stock a huge <br/>
variety of interesting games and puzzles, at least half of which have a sample <br/>
open and available to play and try out right there in the wide aisle. They carry <br/>
arts and crafts supplies in both small and large quantities. They offer a <br/>
party room with activities for various age kids - game time, arts and crafts, <br/>
science discovery, etc. They&#39;re courting teachers, homeschoolers, and just plain <br/>
parents. It&#39;s a fun place.<br/>
