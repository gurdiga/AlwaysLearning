<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005613473">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Ah, now see, I always wonder if we can tell things<br/>
about each other by <br/>
who<br/>
we had crushes on as young to middle teens.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a major crush on David Bowie (still do as a<br/>
matter of fact!). It started when I was 8 and my older<br/>
half sister took me to the Ziggy Stardust concert. I<br/>
also had crushes on Chachi, One of the Ramones (can&#39;t<br/>
remember which one), Ozzy Osbourne, and Jimmy Page<br/>
among many others (primarily musicians!). I usually<br/>
liked people that were considered odd in some way!  <br/>
I liked Peter from the Monkees &#39;cause he always made<br/>
me laugh.<br/>
George was my favorite Beatle (always so quiet and<br/>
good looking!)<br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)  who still likes the odd ones!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s funny, I don&#39;t remember writing this post and<br/>
signing Meghan&#39;s name, but I sure could have!  Just<br/>
insert my name there and it fits like a glove.  Bet<br/>
you love David Duchovney too huh?  He&#39;s pretty odd,<br/>
especially as Mulder.  My husband looks so much like<br/>
him the kids thought he was him on a video.  LOL  I<br/>
like the quiet, thoughtful, often broody ones too.  My<br/>
husband is quiet, but also goofy and a self identified<br/>
Geek, with a capital G.<br/>

Definitely gorgeous. But as far as actors go it&#39;s got<br/>
to be Johnny Dep! He makes my heart go pitter pat (and<br/>
a few other organs as well)! I also think Robert<br/>
Downey Jr is gorgeous (shame about the H problem).<br/>
