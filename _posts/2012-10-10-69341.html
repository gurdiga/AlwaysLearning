That&#39;s a link to a little interview with the narrator.<br/>
<br/>
He sings the songs, using Tolkien&#39;s tunes, when there are some. <br/>
I have an LP album of Tolkien singing his own songs. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
But now if you have kids who aren&#39;t up to reading The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings, or if you&#39;re driving across the country to an Always Learning conference or something, and you want someone to read those to you, here&#39;s a good idea! :-)<br/>

I don&#39;t kow of audible.com is international or if there are other sources in other places for downloads of audio books.  Feel free to share other sources and resources in this thread, if you want.  The laws for book publication between countries has always been a mystery to me--even English language books aren&#39;t always freely available between countries, so I don&#39;t expect it to be straightforward. :-)<br/>

I am fairly new to homeschooling so perhaps this is a well-known link, but a site I&#39;ve had fun with is: Homeschool Freebie of the Day <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolfreebie.wholesomechildhood.com">http://www.homeschoolfreebie.wholesomechildhood.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Although some of their links are pretty schooly, they also share a lot of ebooks and audio recordings, often things I myself enjoy even if my kids aren&#39;t interested.. and it&#39;s all free.<br/>
<br/>
Also run by the same people, is: Homeschool RadioShows<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschoolradioshows.com">http://homeschoolradioshows.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I actually made my first purchase from this site just today - they&#39;re offering a sale (on Oct 11), 11 audio collections for $11.  It&#39;s many hours of old-time radio shows, I know my kids will enjoy the fairy tales and probably a lot of the history re-enactments when the right moment strikes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799462712">I&#39;m glad you posted this - the addition of an unabridged reading of The Hobbit is new, formerly there had only been dramatizations through audible.com. Morgan and I have both gotten into audio books - she likes to listen to the whole book in one or two sittings, which is very hard for a reader! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260012342">Our favorite audio book site is kiddierecords.com. They&#39;ve digitized old children&#39;s books-on-record and you can either stream them or download them for free! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477236422">I am not sure if this is available outside of the USA but here is a resource we use from time to time. They have a pretty good selection and the books are free and available in both MP 3 and MP 4 format.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
