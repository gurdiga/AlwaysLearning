<div id="ygrps-yiv-442596189">Hi,<br/>
My kids are young--James is 4.25, Tyler is 2.5 and Audrey is 4 months.  This is really the first year James has been cognizant of &quot;Christmas&quot; in any real sense. I assumed that he&#39;d take the Santa story in stride like any other fictional character he reads in stories or sees on TV, but he seems to believe or want to believe that Santa is actually coming to our house to give him presents and seems to want me to confirm/validate that.  I assume that the difference between Santa and Mickey Mouse is that people in his real life have asked him what he&#39;s asking for from Santa, etc and other kids mentioning it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how to tread in this area.  I don&#39;t want to lie to him and tell him that the fat elf is coming down our chimney and bringing him presents.  He doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; or is disinterested in the &quot;Santa is the spirit of giving and we can all be Santas for each other&quot; idea.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, both my husband and I loved Christmas as kids but were pretty disillusioned and turned off by Christmas once we knew the &quot;truth about Santa&quot;.  It definitely made us disappointed at being misled and the &quot;magic&quot; of Christmas seemed sorely lacking after the Santa conspiracy (LOL) was uncovered.<br/>
<br/>
So, what would you do if you had a kid who wanted to believe in the literal, popular media-portrayed Santa, but you want to maintain your credibility with him or her?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your insight.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783784425">What I said to my kids was that people don&#39;t see Santa Claus and  <br/>
different people believe different things, and that what I did know  <br/>
for sure is that when I was a kid I would put a stocking up and in the  <br/>
morning there would be candy and toys, and so maybe they should just  <br/>
try that and not worry about the details.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes it works really well to ask them what they think.  Sometimes I <br/>
tell general stories about &quot;Some people believe this and I&#39;ve heard  stories <br/>
to this effect&quot;, but sometimes I just ask, &quot;Hmmm.... What do *you*  think&quot; <br/>
and I often get something back that is a combination of different stories  <br/>
that I&#39;d never heard in that particular blend. Then I can follow up with where  <br/>
my imagination takes me:&quot;Oh! And wouldn&#39;t it be cool if such-and-such  <br/>
happened?!&quot; and we&#39;re off on a story-telling moment.<br/>
 <br/>
When Wyl was about 5, he asked me how Santa could be at so  many malls and <br/>
how they could all look so different (tall, short, black, white,  old, <br/>
young, etc.) and my brain froze in my panic. Uh oh! Is this magical time  over <br/>
already?! WhatDoISayWhatDoISayWhatDoISay-then something I had read on  Always <br/>
Unschooled popped into my head about asking the kids what they think and  I <br/>
did. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really Santa.&quot; and my heart dropped.  <br/>
Then, after a pause, &quot;I think they&#39;re Santa&#39;s helpers, because there&#39;s so <br/>
many  malls that Santa needs to visit kids at, so he has helpers.&quot; Cool-I don&#39;t <br/>
think  I could have come up with that myself (I was still thinking inside <br/>
the box a  lot) with a non-panicked brain at that time. Wyl is 10 1/2 now and <br/>
still  enjoys the magic of Santa-as do I. :~)<br/>

Peace,<br/>

That&#39;s what my mom told me, when I was four or five and saw two  <br/>
different Santas in one day and they didn&#39;t match and one had a  <br/>
clearly fake beard.  She said yes, they were just guys dressed up, so  <br/>
the kids could say what they wanted and feel like they were talking to  <br/>
Santa, but that I shouldn&#39;t tell the younger kids because they liked  <br/>
thinking it was the real Santa.  So I figured &quot;the real Santa&quot; was  <br/>
somewhere else (North Pole) busy doing something else (getting ready  <br/>
for Christmas) and that was fine for me.<br/>

She didn&#39;t lie.<br/>

Are you apologizing to those who believe in Christmas Joy or those who  <br/>
believe in God?<br/>
<br/>
No, don&#39;t really answer that question. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;m glad about is that current Santa traditions don&#39;t have  <br/>
to do with the great threat of coal in the stocking.   When I was  <br/>
little, in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, there was a whole LOT of noise about  <br/>
&quot;are you being good?&quot; and &quot;Have you been good this year?&quot;  It was all  <br/>
about reward for virtue, and punishment for sin.<br/>
<br/>
So the Santa &#39;conspiracy&#39; has become much less a parallel of heaven  <br/>
and hell.<br/>

The same here. Every morning, Sacha (4,5) finds a piece of paper in the calendar which says something like &quot;the surprise today is hidden in a very cold place/where you sleep&quot;, he runs and finds a new present every day. <br/>
He&#39;s so excited when he wakes up! <br/>

About Christmas, i tell him it&#39;s all about giving to people we love, and he knows he&#39;ll have a lot of gifts from the people who love him so much and we&#39;re talking about Santa Claus as a great story, and ther&#39;s the advent calendar, we decorate... and everything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with other posters who suggest talking to him.  Santa Claus is discussed as a real person.  My Santa tale when I was a child was that I needed to be in bed asleep for him to leave me gifts.  If a child sees other kids getting those gifts, they may want to get them too.  And if your son sees the other kids believing in Santa and getting those presents, his logic may suggest that he too should believe in order to receive the gifts. The logic may continue that if he doesn&#39;t believe, he may not get the gifts.<br/>
<br/>
I treated the Santa issue with my children differently.  I didn&#39;t encourage the belief in Santa as a real person or a magical being, but a fun make=believe part of Christmas.  My children were fine with knowing it was me & their dad who put out the gifts.  We let them know there would always be Santa gifts and never talked about the naughty side of the holiday.  The Santa gifts were, and still are, put around the tree after the children went to bed.  They were unwrapped to avoid a potential argument of who gets to open them.  Oh, and they love to help me bring the wrapped gifts out of my closet to place around the tree on Christmas Eve.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I let go of the Santa myth when my oldest daughter was 4 yrs. old and I was pregnant with my son.  A school friend shared her story of becoming a big sister when her mom went to Baby Superstore (a real store that sold baby items) to buy another little girl.  My daughter wanted to know why I would buy a boy instead of a girl because she would rather have a sister than a brother.  I really didn&#39;t like that family&#39;s explanation of babies. So I also wanted my children to know the stories behind the fictional characters, Santa, the tooth fairy,and the Easter bunny.  It hasn&#39;t taken away from our holidays.<br/>

<br/>
When my 18yo was around 4 or 5 we took a couple of stars off of the<br/>
Christmas tree at the mall to buy gifts for underprivileged kids.  She asked<br/>
me what they were for and I told her.  She thought for a minute and said<br/>
&quot;Well why doesn&#39;t Santa bring presents to poor kids?  He could give them<br/>
LOTS of presents.&quot;   I told her at that point that Santa was more like<br/>
Barney and he didn&#39;t really come to people&#39;s houses, but it was fun to<br/>
pretend and tell stories about him.  I honestly think I could have handled<br/>
it better if I had had time to think about it, but I just jumped in with<br/>
that answer.  Luckily she was fine with that information. <br/>
<br/>
My son, however, was the complete opposite.  We had never played up the<br/>
Santa thing with him, but he insisted that Santa was real and he believed in<br/>
him, even if his sisters didn&#39;t.  We let him believe and left cookies for<br/>
Santa and had fun with it.  A year or two later he decided that Santa wasn&#39;t<br/>
real after all.  After initially deciding that Santa wasn&#39;t a good lie to<br/>
tell, those few years that we pretended with Caleb were a lot of fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327849659">Here is some very funny stuff from David Sedaris about cultural differences regarding the Santa Story.  The audio is broken into 3 parts. I&#39;d highly recommend listening to all, it&#39;s laugh out loud funny, but if you&#39;re pressed for time, parts two and three have the Santa stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
(David Sedaris also wrote The Santaland Diaries, which describes his experience working as an elf at Macy&#39;s in New York. Listening to it is part of my Christmas tradition.)<br/>

 <br/>
Margaux asked me very directly yesterday, if she&#39;d been good enough to get presents from Santa.  I told that she&#39;s always very good, even when she&#39;s very naughty and I gave her a nudge and a wink to let her know I was kidding around.  Target has a commercial out this year that is directly about a kid feeling guilty about getting too many presents because she had done bad things and her parents shouldn&#39;t have spent so much money on her because of it.  I believe that is why Margaux asked that question.  It was an interesting take on reward and punishment, but not tied to Santa, tied to monetary worth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120367670">My 7 year old son has apparently been discussing the idea of gifts being tied to good behavior with his friends.  On Thanksgiving he said,  &quot;Mama, you know what I have learned over the past 7 years? That you still get presents even if you are a tiny bit naughty. And I think Gabe agrees with me.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, we have never told him that he wouldn&#39;t get anything due to bad behavior, but I think they see it on all the tv shows and in stores.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always had a problem with tying Santa to goodness/badness for lots of reason.  But a big one being that some kids dont get anything or much for Christmas, so are my kids to assume those kids were bad, when it is just that they dont have the money.  My son the other day said he was going to ask Santa for a Nintendo DS.  If they tip me off what they are wanting and it is too expensive I will typically say, &quot;I dont think Santa will bring that.. He typically doesnt bring things that are that much. (like I have one that wants a computer or a million dollars etc).  This son is 8 and when I said,&quot; I dont think Santa is bringing that this year.&quot; His response was, &quot;well it isnt too expensive cause he has brought one to ... then he listed 4 or 5 kids he knows that have a DS.  So what do you say to that.  Another friend told her kids that parents give Santa money for the gifts- accounting for the discrepency.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885655865">Hello All!  I am a lurker mostly but thought I&#39;d share on this topic as we<br/>
have dealt with it differently for each child.  We have children ages 14,<br/>
12, 11 and 18 months old.  We have homeschooled via unschooling since the<br/>
beginning.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was 6 he looked me directly in the face one night after<br/>
dinner and asked if Santa was real.  It wasn&#39;t that tone of &quot;tell me what I<br/>
want to hear&quot; it was &quot;tell me the truth or I&#39;ll never believe anything you<br/>
say again&quot;.  He had been asking questions for a few weeks and I had used<br/>
many of the suggestions others have shared.&quot;some people believe this&quot; or<br/>
&quot;when I was a child&quot; or &quot;what do you think?&quot; and many, many other lines to<br/>
keep the &quot;magic!&quot;  None of it satisfied him and he finally reached a<br/>
critical point.  I sat down beside him and pulled him in close and said, &quot;Do<br/>
you want the truth honey or the story that we are all told when we are<br/>
children?&quot;  Of course, he said he wanted the truth.  So I drew in a deep<br/>
breath and then we shared about the traditions of Santa and what others have<br/>
carried down from generations past.  He just cried at first but then as we<br/>
talked he began to realized that &quot;Santa&quot; was a concept and matter of the<br/>
heart..doing good for others and sharing from our gain.   That year was<br/>
tough because he &quot;knew&quot; but we began a tradition of him being Santa&#39;s helper<br/>
in our house.he goes to bed with the other children but sneaks out of bed<br/>
after they fall asleep and helps arrange the Santa gifts.  He also helps<br/>
with suggesting what Santa should get each of his siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now, you should know that at 14 and through out his entire life, this is the<br/>
child that seeks truth and values that above all else in relationships.  I<br/>
honestly believed then, when he was 6, and now even after all these years<br/>
that telling him the truth was the right path to travel.  I had a brief<br/>
flash in my minds eye view before our actual conversation that this was a<br/>
make it or break point in our relationship.  And many times since then that<br/>
has been confirmed as he has trusted what we share with him because of the<br/>
foundation of truth we started.  Recently he said to me, &quot;Mom, you and dad<br/>
have a great way of protecting us from too much info until just the<br/>
appropriate time.  When we need to know, you tell us.  And you trust us to<br/>
be able to handle life&#39;s truths when it&#39;s time.  Thank you for knowing and<br/>
thank you for hugging us when it&#39;s hard to understand and helping us through<br/>
it.  Life makes so much more sense that way.&quot;  I was like WOW! Where did<br/>
that come from..and then I reflected for a bit over all the years and times<br/>
he has asked questions and we were truthful and didn&#39;t try to skirt the<br/>
issues.  Then I looked up and said &quot;Thank you God for your wisdom in those<br/>
times!&quot;  I told my son that there was no way dad and I could parent in our<br/>
own power that only God can lead parents to teach their children in just the<br/>
way he needs them to for each individual child!  He was a child with a<br/>
personality and heart for truth very early in his life.nothing else would<br/>
satisfy.  (Many in his life have referred to him as an &quot;old soul&quot; and wise<br/>
beyond his years) My other children will come to the truth as well it will<br/>
just be later for them.  They have yet to ask about the &quot;Santa&quot; myth and<br/>
they love the stories and are still in awe of the &quot;magic&quot; of Santa.  They<br/>
are starting to question but haven&#39;t had the &quot;tell me the truth&quot; moment.  I<br/>
anticipate it is coming though.  And we will handle each one as God leads.<br/>
Who knows..soon enough they&#39;ll all be little elves for the baby!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My input on &quot;Santa&quot; is to pray to know your children&#39;s needs and handle each<br/>
one as an individual.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Blessings, <br/>

I guess I&#39;ve been running with a good crowd lately. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was out shopping on Tuesday--not a very busy day but I went several  <br/>
places.  There were a couple of little kids slightly frustrated but  <br/>
the parents weren&#39;t being awful.  A little girl was lost in Hobby  <br/>
Lobby.  One mom took her up to the front while I looked for the mom.   <br/>
I was calling her name out loud, but she didn&#39;t hear me.  Then in a  <br/>
bit I saw a young mom looking frantic, and asked &quot;Are you Brandi?&quot;   <br/>
Yes!  Your daughter is with another mom, up front.   And then they  <br/>
called her on the PA.  Everyone was sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Either I&#39;m getting lucky or parents are being nicer now than they were  <br/>
being  in the 1990&#39;s (around here, anyway).<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; My kids are young--James is 4.25, Tyler is 2.5 and Audrey is 4 months.  This is really the first year James has been cognizant of &quot;Christmas&quot; in any real sense. I assumed that he&#39;d take the Santa story in stride like any other fictional character he reads in stories or sees on TV, but he seems to believe or want to believe that Santa is actually coming to our house to give him presents and seems to want me to confirm/validate that.  I assume that the difference between Santa and Mickey Mouse is that people in his real life have asked him what he&#39;s asking for from Santa, etc and other kids mentioning it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not sure how to tread in this area.  I don&#39;t want to lie to him and tell him that the fat elf is coming down our chimney and bringing him presents.  He doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; or is disinterested in the &quot;Santa is the spirit of giving and we can all be Santas for each other&quot; idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, both my husband and I loved Christmas as kids but were pretty disillusioned and turned off by Christmas once we knew the &quot;truth about Santa&quot;.  It definitely made us disappointed at being misled and the &quot;magic&quot; of Christmas seemed sorely lacking after the Santa conspiracy (LOL) was uncovered.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what would you do if you had a kid who wanted to believe in the literal, popular media-portrayed Santa, but you want to maintain your credibility with him or her?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for your insight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read what I thought was a good idea in a book before I became a parent and remembered it when the time came with my daughter. I think it would have been the Christmas after her fourth birthday - and likewise her curiosity came from her friends asking her what Santa was bringing her and so on - she asked me if Santa was a real person.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No, but it&#39;s fun to pretend he is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That seemed to work. She was able to participate in the Santa &#39;game&#39; and even enjoy not letting on to her friends who thought he really was a real person.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tricky situation. I still cringe at the nonsense children are fed every Christmas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907317556">We started our son out with - it&#39;s another fun way to celebrate, just like fourth of July Firecrackers, The Easter Bunny, Christmas Trees and decorations, etc.  We always said it was fun to pretend and we always had our Christmas celebration fun.<br/>
<br/>
Zac too has always been keen on actual facts.<br/>
<br/>
When our son, Zachariah, was around age 4 he said to me - &quot;Don&#39;t you wish Santa was real then we wouldn&#39;t have to pay for all those gifts!!!  I said &quot;Yes that would be GREAT!  Wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;  So then we were off on a flight of fancy of what could happen IF we didn&#39;t have to pay!<br/>
<br/>
The other day (he&#39;s 15 now) he said the only hard part of being told the truth from the beginning was not saying anything to the other children that did believe.  We had asked him to not go around blurting out that Santa was just a fun story to all his friends that did believe - that that might ruin their fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were out and he found some documentary war DVD&#39;s he wanted (a subject he is passionate about) they were $7.77 for a set of 2 DVD&#39;s in a package.  We were trying to decide if we wanted to afford them and I asked how long they were and he told me - I turned to Ed (dad) and asked how much it costs to rent a movie at Block Buster and he told me - so I said well buying the DVD sets cost about the same as renting 2 movies.  THEN I asked Zac if he&#39;d mind setting them aside till Christmas so I&#39;d have some gifts for him, as I don&#39;t have many ideas for him this year.  He asked if he could go ahead and watch them as he does not care if he has a bunch of presents to open on Christmas Day.  I would have said &quot;not right now&quot; and gone back to get them as a surprise but there were only one each left and we were an hour away from home - so the answer was yes and he&#39;ll enjoy them now.  I&#39;ll figure out something to get him for Christmas yet  - a surprise if I can.  <br/>

celebrating festivals and traditions that are secular, pagan, etc. but i<br/>
do have a problem raising my children telling them: god is real but you<br/>
can&#39;t see him AND santa is real but you can&#39;t see him. any questions<br/>
they have about faith or anything else for that matter should not be<br/>
caused by my lying to them.  we play harry potter and pretend we are<br/>
fairies and all other fantasies and i am trying to help them to<br/>
understand that santa claus is just like those but baised on this real<br/>
guy.  tomorrow (dec 6th) is the feast day of saint nicholas.  we are<br/>
toying around with different ways to celebrate it and emulate saint<br/>
nicholas instead of it just being about receiving gifts.<br/>

This is almost exactly what we said to Chamille.  I don&#39;t remember how old she was, maybe around 5 or 6.  We even set out cookies and put Santa traps up so that we he comes down the chimney we hear him.  Neither of my kids have EVER wanted to sit on Santa&#39;s lap, both of them have been scared to do so.  I&#39;ve told Margaux that Santa isn&#39;t real, but she refuses to believe me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616832836">Our holiday celebration didn&#39;t really mention Santa Claus. Presents were under the tree but not signed. <br/>
<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t care for the Mall Santas, so our photos with Santa are few and usually someone is crying or looking at Santa with a &quot;what&#39;s with you?&quot; expression. <br/>
<br/>
Our treetop is Dicken&#39;s Ghost of Christmas Past and we decorate with Santas from around the world. (I&#39;m a historian so my take on festivals are always from a cultural study viewpoint.) Each Santa has a different story about the country & tradition. Since we used that view of Santa, the &quot;is he real?&quot; question didn&#39;t come up. <br/>
<br/>
However, we&#39;ve had the privilege of being friends with a variety of people who have taken different roads on this issue and found that often in families that Santa is an issue one of two things are happening: <br/>
<br/>
1) the kids think the presents are connected to Santa, so in their minds, no Santa = no presents. <br/>
2) the kids think that parents want them to believe in Santa. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to have helped you figure how to navigate your Santa dilemma. <br/>

These things didn&#39;t happen at our house, because as each child knew  <br/>
there was no Santa we asked him or her to help, so it was a promotion,  <br/>
in a way and when all of them knew the whole deal, I didn&#39;t have to  <br/>

 <br/>
If it will crush him, don&#39;t do it.  I wouldn&#39;t call it a lie, you&#39;ve perpetuated a story with a fictional character.  Chamille used to tell all kinds of elaborate stories when she was little.  Her friends and cousins were always asking me if they were true, and I&#39;d refer them back to the story teller, and let them ask her.  Sometimes she really wanted the stories to be believed and sometimes they were a part of the imagination games.<br/>

 <br/>
If you want to somehow bring up casual Santa talk, watch a bunch of movies about Santa.  There are so many movies out there with so many takes on Santa, it would be hard for a kid to watch all of them and NOT have questions.  You could go with, &quot;Nobody really knows everything there is to know about Santa, he&#39;s mysterious and people around the world have different ideas about him.  What do you think?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with feeding the imagination of a child.  You don&#39;t have to continue to lie, you can be vague and start making it more of a story of the imagination.  Do you think he&#39;ll feel duped?  Lots of kids believe in Santa.  Our culture believes in Santa, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t exist in malls and cards and stories.  Heck, my youngest, 8, firmly believes in Santa, even though we&#39;ve told her he isn&#39;t real.<br/>
