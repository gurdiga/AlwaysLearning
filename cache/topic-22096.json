This <br/>\nyear we began teaching her at home with a new on-line charter school.  <br/>\nI thought this would be great for her so she can learn at her own <br/>\npace.  She also takes an on-line Math course called EPGY.  It is a good <br/>\nprogram because she gets to work through things on her own, as fast or <br/>\nas slow as she likes.  This year she has gone through all of the work <br/>\nfor her grade in the charter home school.  I have told her that she can <br/>\nnow learn whatever she wants to learn and that it is up to her.
