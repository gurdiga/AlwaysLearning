She does have some food allergies, but they do not make a difference regarding her personality traits!  She reacts to wheat (tummy troubles) and still some to milk.   She is a much happier 12 year old when these foods are kept to a minimum, but her personality traits are just that, personality traits!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a difficult subject but, with carefulness, you can soon see if this is just a personality trait (which can also be seen by looking at family personalities), or whether it is a behavioural reaction to a food.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n    Teresa<br/>\nMumto5kidz  :D<br/>\nliving in New Zealand               <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 16, 2004 4:52 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: [Somewhat Off] Horrbile Tantrums<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 3/14/04 9:25:04 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mostofus@...\">mostofus@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; <br/>\n  The final test is to re-introduce the suspect food.  If the problems return <br/>\n  then you have a confirmation as to whether this was the problem or not.  :D &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I understand the theory, but it could still fail.  <br/>\n  There are lots of factors in life, and kids just get older and grow into and <br/>\n  out of and through different phases.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There seems to be a fad lately of magically controlling kids with drugs or <br/>\n  deprivations or dietary restrictions, when in many cases talking to them and <br/>\n  helping them figure out how to make decisions and express themselves would help <br/>\n  MUCH more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, there are allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But there seem to be more and more moms who turn to look for allergies <br/>\n  instead of learning to deal with interpersonal issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And granted, Howard Gardners ideas of multiple intelligences (which I love a <br/>\n  bunch) suggest that some people just are better than others with interpersonal <br/>\n  stuff.  And that might be passed on genetically, just as other talents can <br/>\n  be, but can and should be nurtured and discussed.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;What if you had made sure he was wearing green socks the whole month during <br/>\n    which he had a growth-spurt in the awareness area?  Could you then be sure <br/>\n    green socks were to be creditted?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; There are correlations which aren&#39;t causes, and children change many time <br/>\n  and <br/>\n    many different ways just by growing older and having more experience in how <br/>\n    to handle their own emotions and moods and sensitivities.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the green socks are removed and a problem returns, it might not have been <br/>\n  because of the socks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Much religious practice and superstition seems based in futile attempts to <br/>\n  control the world, some of which seemed to work a time or two and so are <br/>\n  repeated through the centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;My daughter started having &quot;horrible tantrums&quot; when she was <br/>\n<br/>\n  2&1/2 and at first I thought it was the &quot;terrible twos&quot; that had <br/>\n<br/>\n  finally kicked in. Then when that didn&#39;t sit well my my mother&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\n  intuition/instincts, I realized that I had started eating peanut butter <br/>\n<br/>\n  again recently after a long time of not eating it. Since I was <br/>\n<br/>\n  nursing her, she was getting it too. I quit eating PB and within 24 <br/>\n<br/>\n  hours they were gone. The only time this has reocured is when <br/>\n<br/>\n  she has accidentally ingested PB and she wakes up at night <br/>\n<br/>\n  completely disoriented, screaming and crying.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This account seems plausible, but not all sworn food-sensitivities have this <br/>\n  close a correlation.  I&#39;m not talking about specific people here on this list, <br/>\n  but about the overall trend toward people wanting outside causes for <br/>\n  personality traits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And this inability to process peanut butter could easily be something a child <br/>\n  grows out of.  Lots of kids will get hives or stomach upsets from one food or <br/>\n  another (strawberries, common on the hives) when they&#39;re little but be able <br/>\n  to tolerate the foods fine when they&#39;re older.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
