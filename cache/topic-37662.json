We&#39;re not attacking.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople on the list ARE attacking, and incredibly offensive, twisting  <br/>\nwords and meanings!<br/>\nIf you really wanted to get the unschooling message out, perhaps you  <br/>\nand your listmates should consider guiding others rather than  <br/>\nexpecting them to know all of your rules.  Sharing experiences goes  <br/>\nso much further than nasty attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nobody&#39;s asking anyone to accept anything. It&#39;s a big wide world,  <br/>\nand a DAMNED big internet. Nobody in any way has tried to keep<br/>\npeople on this list. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say anyone told me to stay.  I am telling you why I left,  <br/>\nthough I am sure you could care less.  But I care and it needed to be  <br/>\nsaid, even if on deaf ears.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with you gets attacked.  If they try  <br/>\nto start their own list, that idea and list is attacked.  Talk about  <br/>\nbeing &quot;an adult.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You must not have unschooled long enough to see the proof in your  <br/>\nown family, but hundreds of families here have done so. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ntake a lifetime to &quot;prove&quot; the benefit. People can benefit within an  <br/>\nhour of seeing a different way and just lightening up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point about unschooling being unproven was not that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwork, just that it&#39;s not the only unproven thing that does work.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; You, whoever you are reading this, joined this list. Be adult about  <br/>\nit. If you go into a bar or restaurant and you decide to leave, do<br/>\nyou make an tacky insulting speech on the way out? If you start  <br/>\nreading a book and decide not to finish it, do you call the author<br/>\nand say &quot;Your book sucks!&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I read a book as offensive as the list has been, I would contact  <br/>\nthe writer.  Though most of the offensive statements came not from  <br/>\nyou, but other members.  Since it is your list, the complaint goes to  <br/>\nyou.  At a restuarant. if I got horrible service or food, or the  <br/>\nstaff was offensive, I&#39;d alert the manager.  This is adult behavior.   <br/>\nYour desire to undermine me is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I owned a list that was alienating people, offending them, I&#39;d  <br/>\nwant to know.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t try to slam them, or take their  <br/>\nenergy!  Take your own advise, be adult about it.  Remember all of us  <br/>\nare someone&#39;s child, all worthy of respect and honesty and kindness.   <br/>\nWe are worthy of the same kindness we&#39;d want for our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n From one person who was once a child to another, I hope your list  <br/>\nfills your needs, and I shall look to fill my needs elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============================================<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:  was Re: Also Invited","postDate":"1220205507","msgId":37734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlCRjI1Qjg2MDc4RjRCOUJCMUUyMzBCNDQzNjVEN0VCQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDlBMkUxMEU5LTM5MzgtNEJEQS04OTIwLUNDM0Q4OEUyRTUyRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWM5MGI4NiQzYmQ0NDRlMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPDhDQUQ5OUVBQzI0NDlEMi0xMTg0LTRGQzFAd2VibWFpbC1tZTE2LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8MjEyM0ZEQzAtRTBCNi00Q0YxLTg2OEItQjNFRTU4OUI5MzYyQG1hYy5jb20+IDw5QTJFMTBFOS0zOTM4LTRCREEtODkyMC1DQzNEODhFMkU1MkVAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37730,"nextInTopic":37745,"prevInTime":37733,"nextInTime":37735,"topicId":37662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ed and Zac (14) are downstairs watching Muppets Christmas Carol - go figure - :)   -   We were at Block Buster yesterday and Muppets movies were what he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-253490757\">Ed and Zac (14) are downstairs watching Muppets Christmas Carol - go figure - :)   -   We were at Block Buster yesterday and Muppets movies were what he rented.   He did not care that it was Labor Day weekend and one of his choices was a Christmas movie and all his choices came from the &quot;kiddy isle&quot; at Block Buster.   Yesterday he climbed into my lap (he is taller than I am) and snuggled for a couple of minutes.   The laughter coming from the family room is great.  He did need us with him for &quot;The Muppet Caper&quot; because some of the jokes are so 1970&#39;s-80&#39;s oriented sometimes we have to pause the CD and explain - Same for MASH and Hogan&#39;s Heroes which he likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeast people think he always chooses from the kiddy isle - so not true - War movies with fantastic battle scenes are his most favorite.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very secure in what he likes and does not like - he does not do something just because everyone else does it / likes it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could focus on his (what do I call them? society would call them problems? Dyslexia/Dysgraphia/slow processing speed but with profound Giftedness) - for example he wrote us a note the other day saying &quot;ant jane sid Hi&quot;  what he was saying was &quot;Aunt Janny said hi.&quot;  I chose to just read it / decipher it and say thank you for giving us the message.  It was actually amazing that he wrote it in the first place.  He usually never writes.  Plus his spelling is really improving as he goes along.  Oh and the other amazing thing was he had been on My Space chatting with her - this was a first for him - to chat in writing / typing with anyone.  He is more and more asking how do you spell - wanting to get it correct.  We were not at home when he did the chat with his Aunt Janny so we were not available - though he has called us on our cell phones to ask how to spell something in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday he was talking about going to college.  How he will need to go to get a decent paying job - I chose to discuss with him that there are many paths in life that lead to joy and making enough money to be comfortable.  We gave examples of various trades and self-owned businesses that people do.  Then he talked about how college will be so hard for him because he does not read and write well nor is he good at math (THANK YOU SCHOOL FOR THAT PART OF HIS LIFE - we pulled him from mid-third grade) anyway his father and I talked with him about how things change and he might be good at it by then or if he really wants to go to college then he would have the drive and passion to figure it out at that point in time.  AND if he chooses to go to college we will be there to help if he wants us to.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Also Invited was Re: List problem and dishonesty","postDate":"1220202190","msgId":37730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlBMkUxMEU5LTM5MzgtNEJEQS04OTIwLUNDM0Q4OEUyRTUyRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxMjNGREMwLUUwQjYtNENGMS04NjhCLUIzRUU1ODlCOTM2MkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWM5MGI4NiQzYmQ0NDRlMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPDhDQUQ5OUVBQzI0NDlEMi0xMTg0LTRGQzFAd2VibWFpbC1tZTE2LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8MjEyM0ZEQzAtRTBCNi00Q0YxLTg2OEItQjNFRTU4OUI5MzYyQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37729,"nextInTopic":37734,"prevInTime":37729,"nextInTime":37731,"topicId":37662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-A large percentage of the people who call me for new homeschooler information are considering taking 12 to 16 year old boys out of school.

Kirby is 22 and Marty is 19 and I see  <br/>\nthem in contrast to the other young men around them all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one current story:  Kirby and his roommate and some others who  <br/>\nwork with them at Blizzard in Austin all talked about using a bonus  <br/>\nthey thought they were getting (still might) to go to Las Vegas to be  <br/>\nthere on Talk Like a Pirate Day, at Treasure Island (or stay  <br/>\nsomewhere, but to be there that weekend).  The bonus hasn&#39;t come  <br/>\nthrough as they thought it would yet, so some of them can&#39;t afford to  <br/>\ngo and others are going.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s roommate has also invited a lot of his high school friends  <br/>\nfrom here to meet them there.  They all plan to drink and gamble.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby (22) told me he&#39;s still planning to go, but he&#39;s not wanting to  <br/>\ngamble any more than some small limited amount, if any, and doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmuch like to drink.  One other guy who&#39;s going is kind of that way so  <br/>\nKirby figures some of the time he&#39;ll only have that one other guy to  <br/>\nhang out with.  He knows there&#39;s still lots of stuff to do there, and  <br/>\nI&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have fun, but I think most 22 year olds with a healthy  <br/>\nbank account and a trip to Las Vegas booked already would not be  <br/>\ncalling their moms to say it doesn&#39;t sound all that fun or productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lest anyone think that means Kirby&#39;s a shy mama&#39;s boy, he is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (19) is working at a restaurant so most of his income is cash  <br/>\nevery day after the shift, his percentage of the waiters&#39; tips (he&#39;s  <br/>\nbussing tables at a Persian restaurant).  He comes home, counts it,  <br/>\nwrites the amount in a notebook, and then I&#39;m not sure exactly what,  <br/>\nbut sometimes he gives Keith a pile of bills and Keith electronically  <br/>\ntransfers that amount from our account to Marty&#39;s savings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day someone was playing Rock Band with Marty and wanted to  <br/>\ndownload Metallica or some such.  Marty said &quot;I don&#39;t have $15.&quot;  I  <br/>\nobjected to the lie, but what Marty meant was he didn&#39;t have $15 in  <br/>\nhis video game/entertainment budget.  He&#39;s making payments on his  <br/>\njeep and putting half his pay in savings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was making fun of him behind his back the other day, but in a  <br/>\npretty complimentary way.  She said it was interesting that Marty had  <br/>\nthe Dodd-family genes (remember I&#39;m only a Dodd by marriage; she&#39;s  <br/>\nnot talking about me!) and would say &quot;I can&#39;t spend that money, it&#39;s  <br/>\nfor my grandchildren&#39;s college fund!&quot;  She was making up a humorous  <br/>\nexample, but he really, truly, at the age of 19, is thinking of his  <br/>\ndistant future.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids their age in school have many other things to think about.  More  <br/>\n&quot;real life&quot;?  Some would claim so.  Things like exams, homework,  <br/>\nreports, a &quot;healthy&quot; social life (drinking and gambling and running  <br/>\naround).

Her symptoms included severe hyperactivity<br/>\ndangerously combined with impulsivity (such as no thought or care<br/>\nbefore running into a busy street), inability to focus and related<br/>\nfrustration with herself, very oppositional behavior, poor eye<br/>\ncontact, difficulty listening, emotional hypersensitivity, social<br/>\nanxiety, overwhelmed by clean-up projects.  She would say very<br/>\nnegative things about herself and had chronic headaches.  Her ADHD<br/>\ncounterpart of autistic &quot;flapping&quot; was endless somersaulting on our<br/>\nottoman just to keep herself in motion.  Sometimes she would launch<br/>\nherself into belly-flops onto the ottoman or a bed just to keep<br/>\nherself in motion.  Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>\ncontinuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>\nover and over again. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids are throwing themselves on ottomans or tumbling on furniture that&#39;s not a problem with the kid&#39;s behavior that&#39;s an indication that the mom needs to take that kid to the park or to the pool or to the back yard and PLAY with him.   Get a tumbling mat if the sofa&#39;s about worn out.  Get a trampoline.  Get a punching bag.    Get at least as interested in helping your kid do those things (she&#39;s clearly telling you) she wants and needs to do as you are in telling us why she needs fixing.<br/>\n  <br/>\n And this: ***Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>\ncontinuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>\nover and over again.***<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who was ever young and loved music rewound their favorite parts of songs eight billion times.  Jeezy Creezy.   These days if I don&#39;t understand lyrics I can get information online.  In the old days, it was rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind.   My son&#39;s big old Wurlitzer organ has a built in tape player so he can listen to tiny segments as many times as he wants.   Why do you suppose cd players and dvd players have those search features?  If you could know that in twenty years she&#39;d be a sought after sound editor, or breaker of secret codes would you think of these behaviors as negative things?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a sign of a pretty smart kid who becomes oppositional when adults want to pick apart every thing they do.  I think it&#39;s psychologically healthy to oppose those who want to control us.   I would avoid eye contact when I knew that someone was going to tell me all the stuff I *needed* to do or not do in order to win their approval.  When a parent says to a kid &quot;Look at me.&quot;  They intend the  power of their eye contact to have a controlling influence on that child and the purpose is to make the child behave the way the parent wants.   Kids aren&#39;t idiots.  They know what &quot;Look at me&quot; means.   They know they&#39;re being bullied.  I looked at a bunch of youtube videos of kids with autism after one thread on another list and what I came away thinking was that any kid who has such annoying parents as those in the video is doing pretty well to find a way to cope.  One video about avoidance of eye contact was a person repeatedly asking her kid to look at her while she filmed him when he was busy doing something he found very interesting.   An adult would have told her to take a flying leap.   Her child was more polite.  That video would have been better titled, &quot;Thoughtless Mom Pestering Busy Kid.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Experts&quot; for awhile (and maybe still) told parents to look their kid in the eye when they wanted to convey something important.  That was so the parent could be sure the kid heard (as we all know we hear through our eyeballs) and so the parents could tag that kid as &quot;not listening&quot; if he still did the thing after having had the eyeball treatment.   We don&#39;t do that to adults.  If your boss said, &quot;Look at me, LOOK AT ME, I want you to take these papers to Fred.&quot;  You&#39;d think the guy was an A hole.  Well guess what? &lt;g&gt;   And if you met someone who got in your face and maybe grabbed your shoulders or chin  to force eye contact how often would you want to hang around that person?   Let&#39;s not do that rude and creepy thing to our kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never knew a kid who didn&#39;t flap or flop or fling or flail or twirl, hop, wiggle or engage in repetitive behaviors. Is a baby dropping a toy over and over again and watching it fall engaging in abnormal repetitive behaviors? Of course not.   As our kids grow there is so much for them to learn and we really don&#39;t have to see their experimentation with sound, motion and sensation as defective or abnormal.    Kids learn and grow better when they get to decide when they&#39;re ready to use the potty, dress themselves, use a fork, read, spell, ride a bike...and they are the only ones who can decide when an experiment in squeaking or flapping is over.  <br/>\nIf it bugs you, go into the other room or find a place for them to flop or bark or hop where they won&#39;t bug or hurt anybody else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is the behaviors annoy and/or embarrass parents and when parents are annoyed or embarrassed or frustrated we know that can&#39;t be a problem with the parents...that&#39;s a problem with that disordered kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also seen parents  ignore really socially unacceptable behaviors in a child.  The bigger problem is they also mostly ignore the kid and his needs.   Maybe they&#39;re busy with other easier kids or a job or a sick mom and that different kid gets brushed off because it seems like he just takes up so much precious time.  So when a kid gets ignored and his behaviors get ignored the problem can get big.  That&#39;s still not a problem with the kid.  That&#39;s a problem with the parenting.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not interested in a list where parents whine about their difficult kids and make up excuses and justifications for labeling and controlling. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":340838541,"authorName":"Clarissa Fetrow","from":"&quot;Clarissa Fetrow&quot; &lt;clarissafetrow@...&gt;","profile":"cla1024","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Also Invited was Re: List problem and dishonesty","postDate":"1220115058","msgId":37674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxMzQ4ODI4MDgwODMwMDk1MHQzYTAyYWE2N29hMWMzMjJhZjFlOTVjYmFlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2NUFENTQwNjFFRTQ5NjNBQjlGQ0YzQzExRjcxNUFCQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDAwZTUwMWM5MGE2YiQ5MzM4ZWU1MCRiOWFhY2FmMCRAY29tPgkgPEU2NUFENTQwNjFFRTQ5NjNBQjlGQ0YzQzExRjcxNUFCQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":37672,"nextInTopic":37725,"prevInTime":37673,"nextInTime":37675,"topicId":37662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been thinking about this situation and what I can learn from it about healthy email list etiquette.

And it made me wonder - if *I* got one, unsolicited, how many other<br/>\npeople did too?<br/>\nI think even if a member of a list wanted to create a more specific email<br/>\nlist for any sort of sub-group, say unschoolers who like to draw, it still<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be effective to write individual emails that said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed in your posts that your child likes to draw, would you like to join<br/>\nthe new UnschoolersWhoDraw list?&quot; because that would miss all the other<br/>\nparents of unschoolers who draw, but who have just never mentioned it on the<br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since the new list&#39;s entire basis for existence is dissatisfaction<br/>\nwith the original list (which can certainly happen, and is a legitimate<br/>\nreason for starting a new list, in my opinion), I think it would have have<br/>\nbeen an important courtesy to notify the owner of the original list that the<br/>\nnew list owner planned to invite members of the original list to join her<br/>\nnew list.  That this notification didn&#39;t happen doesn&#39;t smell good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am on three unschooling and/or homeschooling local email lists in my<br/>\nstate.  I recently wanted to let members of each list know that the other<br/>\nlists exist, so everyone could have more choices.  In that case, there was<br/>\nno dissatisfaction on my part, just more of a sense of bringing together.<br/>\n Each list has a different slant, and a different flavor, and I&#39;m a member<br/>\nof them all.  I am very glad that I posted my info about the other groups,<br/>\nin each case, to the whole list.  I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to make the same<br/>\nmistake that happened here, seeing how strong the icky factor is.<br/>\n<br/>\nClarissa<br/>\nSeattle, WA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.
