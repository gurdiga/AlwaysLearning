I aim for prevention.  In our case what helps the most is for me to get in a really calm centered loving state, and then join with the child who is going to have a rough transition with the computer sharing.  Watch him, Talk to him about what he is doing.  I&#39;d get on the &quot;bad&quot; computer and ask him to show me how to get where he is.  I would stay fully involved and present with what he is working on and eventually mention he could take over for me on this computer since it will soon be brother&#39;s turn on that one.  I would aim to keep the focus on what we are doing together and not on the switching computers.  This tends to help my kids.  It feels a bit like I&#39;m carrying them over a huge chasm that they can&#39;t leap on their own.  Warnings, reminders, etc feel like triggers.  One of my kids told me that reminders feel like unfair controlling rules.  Maybe even for your son, a reminder feels like computer time is about to be over?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help for the older brother to mention something cool he found on the bad computer and ask if he wants him to leave it up for him on his turn?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, after some questioning, I realized that our bad computer had a really unresponsive tracking pad- so we got an external mouse for it.  That helped the bad computer&#39;s status a little.  If it is screen size, can you try running it thru your TV for fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, not sure if you have a history of asking the older brother to give in since it means so much to younger brother.  I did this for a while and then realized I was creating a situation where the younger brother learned to get out of control and use bullying threat tactics to get his way.  It&#39;s been very hard to remedy.  I&#39;m still working constantly.  What I realize now is that those big fits at a time of transition are often way less about the object and way more about big emotion.  Gosh I wish I had just focused on dealing with his big feelings and not trying to make him feel better by getting what he wanted.  With my most explosive son, he often has immense jealous feelings about his older brother--so having to give over the good thing to the brother he is often jealous of really brings on the bang!  I&#39;m not sure if this is taking it way deeper than your personal situation, but I wish I had realized this piece years ago!  Now, I get right there with him while he&#39;s having a meltdown.  I help him identify what he&#39;s feeling.  I help him try out healthy ways of releasing the rage. I help him take ownership of his actions.  My son is now 9 and is slowly getting better at managing the bursts of emotion.  I could use more wisdom on helping kids with enormous emotions too!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAli<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":551357656,"authorName":"michellemacp@att.net","from":"&quot;michellemacp@...&quot; &lt;michellemacp@...&gt;","profile":"michellemacp@att.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Sharing & Preferences was Re: Minecraft support","postDate":"1367460248","msgId":71359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtsc2hpbytuMWFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEIxQkFFRjlCLTBBNEUtNDVDOS1CNTk1LThFQ0EyMERCMzU0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71358,"nextInTopic":71360,"prevInTime":71358,"nextInTime":71360,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I would suggest that he use it while his brother is at school, and let the school-going boy use it first when he s home, but try to do it without a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-23119779\">-=- I would suggest that he use it while his brother is at school, and let the school-going boy use it first when he&#39;s home, but try to do it without a resentment being built up about the return from school. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we have been doing and the screaming, crying, wailing happens when it is the afternoon / evening and our older son&#39;s turn.

Really, the<br/>\n&gt; opportunities for learning through Minecraft are limited only by the<br/>\n&gt; player&#39;s own imagination and access to the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For folks who respond better to numbers, research, and such, here are<br/>\n&gt; some facts and figures. Minecraft is played by millions of people<br/>\n&gt; around the world, people of all ages and from many cultures. When I<br/>\n&gt; checked the statistics at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://minecraft.net/stats\">https://minecraft.net/stats</a> just now,<br/>\n&gt; 9,760,164 people had bought the game, and in the last 24 hours, 11,805<br/>\n&gt; people had bought the game. Many thousands of people have attended the<br/>\n&gt; past Minecraft conventions. (My family attended one of those<br/>\n&gt; conventions, and we met some lovely unschooling families there!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those who question the tastes of the masses: Minecraft is NOT a<br/>\n&gt; first person shooter and can be played in creative and non-violent<br/>\n&gt; modes.

He refreshed my memory about a season here at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Fantasy X had come out.  It was a beautiful, mesmerizing game with the best music any of us had ever heard in a game.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had a job and went to karate, so that limited his play.  Marty played sometimes when Kirby was gone or asleep.  That year, when they were 13 and 16 or so, Kirby had a friend who was 15 or 16 and lived walking distance.  His home was very unsafe for him, physically (crazy brother who had been in jail or mental lock-up for trying to kill the younger brother with a shovel--not Joey, but Joey had seen it and was afraid, and now that violent brother was home, and the parents were not very helpful)...  Joey was staying here, like a ghost.  Not officially.  Kirby made a bed on the floor under his desk.  He would take Joey food in there.  Joey didn&#39;t want to come out and eat with the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt night after Kirby and Marty were asleep, Joey would go in the den and play Final Fantasy.  It was as though he had the night shift.  But in the morning, I would find Joey asleep, with the remote in his hand, and the game paused or on a menu, but playing that soothing music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThree teenaged boys together couldn&#39;t play that game all day and all night. :-)   And it&#39;s not that they didn&#39;t try, and it&#39;s not that we didn&#39;t let them, but they all slept, sometime in that 24 hour cycle, and all three at once when it was really late.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve all grown up to be nice guys with jobs and friends who don&#39;t play video games all the time, but do play them sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not Minecraft, but it&#39;s a true story that might help people feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are dozens and hundreds of things teenaged boys could be doing that aren&#39;t good for them or the neighborhood, but these were in the house taking turns with a video game, reading comic, playing card games and board games between times.  Other kids would come to play other things, or to watch someone (usually Kirby) play Final Fantasy.   I remember it as a peaceful time of intense interest in something elaborate and challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547671143,"authorName":"supermomblues","from":"&quot;supermomblues&quot; &lt;supermom2jakeandemmy@...&gt;","profile":"supermomblues","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Minecraft support","postDate":"1363556372","msgId":70982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtpNWQ2aytlazkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZFRjVDMUI0LUQ0MkUtNEI3Qy04RkVDLTM3NzE3QjQ1OTlEMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70914,"nextInTopic":70989,"prevInTime":70981,"nextInTime":70983,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a little late in this conversation, but I wanted to throw my two cents in :-) My son is five and has been playing minecraft for well over a year.

I recently joined this forum looking for inspiration and support in unschooling.  I finally found Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, which led me here.  I have four sons.  They are 13,9,4,2.  For about a year, the oldest three have been playing Minecraft.  My question for you is about addiction to it.  Have any of you faced this issue?  My oldest child tends to get passionate about one thing and pursue it intensely for years.  His brothers tend to follow his lead.  For the first 6 years of his life it was basketball.  That was fun and easy to pursue with him.  The next 6-7 years were Lego.  Now the family is onto Minecraft.  This is the first time the passion looks like addiction at times and I&#39;m not sure what to do. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a mom, I&#39;ve learned that doing nothing at first is usually wise, observing and waiting-- usually things unravel and solve themselves.  My husband is getting upset.  I sometimes feel sick with worry. Here is a picture of our life these days.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The youngest player was 3 when he started.  He is a marvel- the tiny little fingers expertly controlling that boxy figure.  Now 4 years old, he wakes up in the morning and goes straight to the computer.  He has to check who is on Z-Craft (the boys run a public server).  Most days, he never stops playing or watching youtube videos of other people playing, the entire day.  If he does stop, it is because he is enticed by the 2 year old or by me into something fun- but never for more than a few minutes- gotta run back to the computer.  If we have to leave the house for any reason, he brings the laptop and plays single player in the car.  I bring him food, drinks, powercord.  He often Skypes with 10-12 year olds and plays Minecraft Hunger Games with them or discusses issues on Z-Craft.  I see him learning to read words, typing tons of commands, learning strategies, making friends...  This is a very deep place for him- he is SO young and has so much to learn from the opportunities it provides.  But his little face is getting so pale, sometimes even looks yellow.  And he is SO young!  There is a part of me that feels like he is missing out on the real world, these fabulous years of interacting with mommy!  I check in with him and ask him about what he&#39;s doing...but mostly I&#39;m engaged in playing with the 2 year old or doing household stuff with the 2 year old.  It is very easy to just leave him playing minecraft with his brothers while I do___ with the little guy.  Sometimes what we are doing looks SO interesting and fun that he wants to participate, but he seems to feel naked without the laptop, so he brings it and turns back to it every minute or two.   How do I decide if this is a problem that I need to do something about?  (Fear scenario running thru my head: HEADLINE: parents &quot;unschool&quot; kid and from age 3, he spends every waking minute gaming on Minecraft until he can no longer do anything else.  He is so addicted and entrenched in the Minecraft world, that his fingers can&#39;t leave the keyboard- even though he wants to do other things- the addiction is so strong, he cannot break away)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The 9 & 13 year olds sleep later and roll out of bed and sit and stare for a while.  After talking with 4 year old about server issues, or new kits on MCPvp, they grab their computers and start to play. However, their lives are considerably more busy- a couple days a week they go to activities that they enjoy, they have friends who come over and entice them outside to play kickball, they play on sports teams and willingly get off Minecraft for games & practices.  Even still, they manage to play minecraft or watch minecraft videos for around 6 hours per day on busy days and on free days (3-4 per week) they play 12-14 hours or even more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The 4 & 13 year olds are mostly docile and sweet and easy.  But the 9 year old tends to get angry, loud, and violent.  These issues are scary for me.  So he is DETERMINED to win at this minecraft server that offers Hunger Games scenarios with 150 players- last one left alive wins.  This is entirely engaging to him.  He has won 11 times.  He wants to win 100 times. There is $ involved- they sell kits with powers and monthly fees for ranks.  He buys all these things.  The pattern has been that as the evening comes on, he gets more and more desperate to win one game!  He plays over and over, getting more and more heightened.  He cannot go to bed.  He must win!  He is getting so tired, everyone else in the house has fallen asleep.  He is still awake, trying again and again!  I wake up, I hear him crying!  He is SO tired.  He can&#39;t stop.  He keeps coming in second or third!  Why can&#39;t I win?  Sometimes he gives in to snuggling in bed with me at this point (usually 12:30-1am).  I am way too exhausted to stay up with him.  Other times he just keeps playing and I&#39;m not sure when he gets in bed!  ;(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I sometimes sit next to him and watch.  He gets so explosive with a loss that he will lash out at whoever is near.  Just yesterday I could tell he was at explosion point and asked if he wanted to walk the dogs with me.  He said yes, but then as the game ended he jumped up and attacked me, his whole body shaking and eyes popping out.  I was scared and was grateful his body is still small enough that he can&#39;t truly hurt me!  He came on the walk and calmed down.  I explained how scary that attack was for me, and how scary and dangerous it is for his brothers when he does it to them.  He seems to take it in. We get home, he runs straight back to the computer to play more.  No more violent episodes that day.  Phew.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there an addiction component?  Am I evolving into what I saw discussed a few days ago &quot;free range&quot; parenting?  Do I just let them play MC because it requires so little from me?!   Anyone else here struggling with similar issues?  I feel alone in this world, like everyone around me is not safe to talk to.

I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know. What&#39;s more, I work with a 72 year old woman who doesn&#39;t seem to know when &quot;enough is enough&quot; - she sleeps something like four hours a night and spends most of the rest of her time upholstering furniture. She&#39;s been doing that for 40 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s some big bad cultural pressure against the idea that children have passions. I remember when I was first reading about unschooling getting all creeped out at the word &quot;passion&quot; applied to children. Children shouldn&#39;t be passionate, they should be well-rounded. Even though adults aren&#39;t well rounded at all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I mean in the sense that usually at 4, the children<br/>\n&gt; want to be playing with mommy when she is home<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At 4, my daughter was already pretty introverted, and from birth she has prefered to do things for long stretches of time. When she was 4, a lot of what she did - hours every day - was cut shapes out of paper. She&#39;d go through a whole stack of computer paper a week, easily, sometimes two. That much paper. Hours and hours every day. We went to our first unschooling conference that year - Live and Learn - and I stayed in a largish cabin with a shared kitchen/common room. I spent a lot of time cleaning up paper, and other parents commented on that: does your kid do this All the Time? It was only about half her waking hours, really, but that was still a lot. She&#39;s moved on from that to other things, but she still spends hours every day on her current passion. For awhile it was legos. Now it&#39;s fan-fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child in the original post has brothers and sisters - Mo has a half-brother. If he&#39;s around, he fills up all her social needs really quickly. If the child in the original post is a strong introvert as well as being really passionate about what he&#39;s doing, it could easily be that he&#39;s a bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of people in his life. That&#39;s not a problem with the computer, it&#39;s someone using the computer as a tool. Without it, he might use books, or painting, or paper cutting. He could easily be spending exactly as much time indoors, focused on his passion and/or protective shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, that would explain this from the original post:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we are doing looks SO interesting and fun that he wants to participate, but he<br/>\nseems to feel naked without the laptop, so he brings it and turns back to it<br/>\nevery minute or two.&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also important to note that he&#39;s Not doing One thing, he&#39;s doing several:<br/>\nplaying Minecraft<br/>\nwatching videos<br/>\nskyping<br/>\nreading<br/>\nwriting<br/>\nThe fact that all those things seem to revolve around a single subject isn&#39;t any different than another child who wants pirate clothes, pirate stories, pirate movies, pirate pajamas, pirate sheets, and pirate themed food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;maybe it is because I am still deschooling, but I feel like if to<br/>\n&gt; unschool is to be with the children helping them, explooring, and learning<br/>\n&gt; together, then having the children playing games all day isn&#39;t unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Having&quot; kids do anything is problematic, but supporting kids in what they value and care about is the basis of How unschooling works.

Mothers who want to decide in advance how much that should be might be the same kinds of moms to tell their kids exactly what and when, where and how to eat; and then they might think they know how to teach their children to read, and what exactly they should know about history and science.  That&#39;s legal, and can be fun (especially for the mom, maybe not for the child), but it&#39;s not the purpose of this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/physicality\">http://sandradodd.com/physicality</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think that listening to your mama intuition (not necessarily your fears) is an important part of unschooling. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf whatever any mother thinks is as legitimate as what any other mother thinks, and if whatever a mother does is to be justified with  &quot;that was my intuition,&quot; then there&#39;s no reason to have a discussion like this, nor any discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mother is accepting and supportive of her child&#39;s interests, which will be different for each child, then she&#39;s helping that child learn while she learns more about that child�each child.   She can&#39;t just &quot;have an intuition&quot; that covers all of her children in advance and for all their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome mothers are sure their intuition to spank and slam a kid into time out is sensible. Intuition is quite variable, among humans. Some have more of it than others; some have nearly none.   Encouraging parents to learn to pay attention to their intuition is good.  But here&#39;s the thing:  If they had been allowed from a very early age to make more of their own decisions, those with the inborn ability to make those kinds of decisions would be GREAT at it by the time they were older!    So advising a mom to follow her intuition to limit her child&#39;s choices in these instances has an inherent flaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Minecraft support","postDate":"1362983186","msgId":70892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyQ0I2MEYxLTU2MzktNDlDNC1CNUVGLUY1MTQ4MzNFRDE5OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTTZBM04xPWtrOTEySlJYVDkramdpazdWaFIwLS1HTGpVVXV5Rkt5QWI2VEYyTlorQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEZFRjVDMUI0LUQ0MkUtNEI3Qy04RkVDLTM3NzE3QjQ1OTlEMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQU02QTNOMT1razkxMkpSWFQ5K2pnaWs3VmhSMC0tR0xqVVV1eUZLeUFiNlRGMk5aK0FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70891,"nextInTopic":70893,"prevInTime":70891,"nextInTime":70893,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-We ve been really impressed at how well David is responding to frustrations lately.

It is good to do it side by side while in the midst of another activity, like walking. It will take more than one time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, just to clarify, is this perfectly accurate? Are all his brothers afraid, even the elder? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was much younger and sometimes hit others, I would always focus on the hurt child first, ask them if they were ok, how they felt, get the story, apologize on Jayn&#39;s behalf. I would talk to Jayn separately about why she hit out (there was always some provocation from her pov). But the biggest help was pointing out what showed me the other child&#39;s feelings accurately - such as that she was crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not enough to stop there, with how it is scary for you when he does something. It is important to help him verbalize his feelings - he may be scaring himself too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs help to learn to recognize the clues that his head of steam is building - and of course when he is getting hungry - much earlier. But even more important, he needs to learn other strategies for coping with his own frustration, whether it be deep breathing, bouncing, walking away briefly, jumping jacks, a cuddle, whatever it is. Most likely at your suggestion at first, in a trial and error manner, investigating what feels right to feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he should not be alone with his brothers when there is a danger of an explosion, while he is still learning these strategies. It really has to be your job to protect the others, especially the littles. I only assume that he is alone with them sometimes because you say  === when he does it to them. ===<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not an addiction.

However I think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-355665670\">This is a really long and detailed post, and I appreciate that because it is a lot of information. I like how you described the typical day. However I think you are braiding some issues together - your kids&#39; different behaviors and some fears about yourself. I want to point out a couple of things. Before going forward I will say that I have a 13 year old full-time gamer - World of Warcraft and some The Sims, rarely Minecraft - who has been gaming focused for...gosh...four or five years. She also enjoys watching You Tube vids of other people gaming, and I hear her laughing out loud over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvidently your children have different temperaments. This does not affect the principles of unschooling, but it changes how they applied practically. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== for about a year.....first 6 years of his life it was basketball.  .....The next 6-7 years were Lego ===<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are seeing something different in only one year, versus the 6 year cycle of these other passions. Is it an appearance of intensity? The 6 year passions changed with time. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== I&#39;ve learned that doing nothing at first is usually wise, observing and waiting-- usually things unravel and solve themselves. ===<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will not support unschooling to see passions as problems (is that what you mean by &quot;things&quot;) to &quot;unravel and solve themselves&quot;. I think you mean &quot;do nothing harmful&quot; or &quot;avoid nagging or pushing or coercing&quot;. Do you?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just to be clear, unschooling is not &quot;doing nothing&quot; about passions. It is about actively supporting them, and finding ways to see how our children value passions even when we may not appreciate them in the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== This is the first time the passion looks like addiction at times === <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you write this, I&#39;m not sure what you mean, or which child you are referring to. What does &quot;look like addiction&quot; mean? <br/>\n<br/>\nWriters in mainstream media and parenting often use the word &quot;addiction&quot; fuzzily in reference to electronic media and new technologies in a way that they never use to other children&#39;s activities. I notice that it is also sometimes used in reference to adult gaming. I think part of it has to do with the concept of productivity - person is spending their time in a leisure activity instead of producing something. In the case of children, whom they assume are in school, they are not producing measurable education. Even when they see some learning, they don&#39;t consider it to be as valuable as school academics. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is unhelpful to unschooling to use the jargon of addiction about our children&#39;s activities or pleasures. It&#39;s a filter that can cast every simple action as a negative.<br/>\n<br/>\n===  The youngest player was 3 when he started.  He is a marvel- the tiny little fingers expertly controlling that boxy figure.....I see him learning to read words, typing tons of commands, learning strategies, making friends...===<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may sound odd, but you may have a bona fide genius here. He is doing things at 4 that many other people are starting at 8, 9 and older. It&#39;s unlikely to help him be happy to try to steer him to younger person activities. The learning going on sounds wonderful, and if you look for specifics you will see even more, like the kinds of skills and things that Sandra mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to add even more of their passion to their lives, like Minecraft themed tee shirts, Minecraft books and strategy guides, access to game design software and websites. Go to Minecon (not sure if there is a minimum age) if you can. There is an Unschoolers Gaming group too, which is packed with miners. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== But his little face is getting so pale, sometimes even looks yellow ===<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you afraid he has jaundice? Because sitting at a computer isn&#39;t listed as a cause for that. If he has liver problems that is another issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you worried about vitamin D from lack of sun? I like gummy vites and Emergen-C vitamin drink powders. Jayn does too. She also loves smoothies. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== There is a part of me that feels like he is missing out on the real world, these fabulous years of interacting with mommy...   It is very easy to just leave him playing minecraft with his brothers.... How do I decide if this is a problem that I need to do something about? === <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you feel like you are missing out on him. I wonder if you can find a few moments to spend time with him alone, while he plays, and ask him questions about what he is doing, ask him to show you things that he likes about the games - you focus on him, rather than hope that he joins in with you and his little brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 13. They continue to be fabulous years. Because there is no school caused separation, no refocus onto peers and loss of attachment, the interaction is still wonderful - even though it is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n===HEADLINE: parents &quot;unschool&quot; kid and from age 3, he spends every waking minute gaming on Minecraft until he can no longer do anything else.  He is so addicted and entrenched in the Minecraft world, that his fingers can&#39;t leave the keyboard- even though he wants to do other things===<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he doesn&#39;t want to do other things at the moment. He has the opportunity to do other things freely and is choosing Minecraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is true isn&#39;t it? There isn&#39;t the lurking fear that you or Dad are going to take it all away is there? Were there limits before? Are the computers new? Are you still in the honeymoon? I got the idea that this was long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== But the 9 year old tends to get angry, loud, and violent.  These issues are scary for me.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in great part a temperament issue, I suspect. Jayn would react physically to her frustrations much more strongly when younger - but she grew out of it almost entirely. Now she is able to verbalize frustrations - but she continues to work through to her gaming goals with great tenacity and perseverance sometimes over months, which are terrific personal characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that made, and makes, the biggest difference to her serenity and ability to stay calmer in the face of adversity is FOOD. Make sure your 9 year old has snacks and drinks beside him before you leave him for the night. He may need more small snacks more frequently than the others to keep his emotions on a more even keel. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething others have suggested in the past is something like a mini-trampoline set up right by the computer, so that a child can jump while watching a You Tube of a game unfold, for just a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps he needs something like a sock-em thing - those things that bounce back when you punch them - to move with physically. I used to put my hands up for Jayn to hit and push on, which quickly resolved to wrestling and pushing. But it can be hard, and you might be better just not being right next to him if he explodes. Better still to catch it early and give him some food, remind him to breath deeply, and model other calming strategies, as well as sympathize with his frustrations. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn and I will sometimes throw a small pillow back and forth to each other while she watches Yogscast in the background. Sometimes she dances around too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iggyjingles.blogspot.com\">http://www.iggyjingles.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136234893,"authorName":"Shauna Reisewitz","from":"Shauna Reisewitz &lt;shaunareisewitz@...&gt;","profile":"shaunareisewitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Minecraft support","postDate":"1362957745","msgId":70884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGOTNCMzQ3LTc0NUYtNDRDOC04OThELTIzMzkxQzE5NUVFM0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70867,"nextInTopic":70886,"prevInTime":70883,"nextInTime":70885,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think that listening to your mama intuition (not necessarily your fears) is an important part of unschooling.

It started off to be southern Arizona to San Diego, and as they talked about why and where and how, it became parts of Nevada they hadn&#39;t seen, and Salt Lake City, over to stay with friends in Colorado on the way home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know for certain that some of Marty&#39;s planning and negotiation skills have come from the gaming he&#39;s been doing his whole life.  He sees it in terms of cost, efficient use of resources (which vehicle to take, where to stay, how many free-to-cheap &quot;moves&quot; (overnight stays) can earn them one expensive night in a themed hotel in Salt Lake City, how to make it up to Ashlee that San Diego, her first choice, didn&#39;t make the final plan, and how best to meet friends in Las Vegas to see haunted sites, and whether it&#39;s worth buying expensive Penn and Teller tickets or risking not seeing them on the hope of getting less expensive tickets.   ALL that reasoning CAN be learned from hours and hours of gaming with other people (known or unknown others).  It can&#39;t even nearly be learned from textbooks and workbooks.  Not a bit of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the subject line is &quot;Minecraft support,&quot; but that&#39;s not what you need.  You need clarity support, and more understanding of the principles that can help you see all sorts of things in the context of natural learning and peaceful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/clarity\">http://sandradodd.com/clarity</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":254796796,"authorName":"Virginia Warren","from":"Virginia Warren &lt;vafnord@...&gt;","profile":"vafnord23","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Minecraft support","postDate":"1362938111","msgId":70865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBS1g5OGZpWVRmV3VVd2g2bUFIVEoreUFuZD1tTm1CaVNEU3E4dWVWSExULURLQzdSd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRlpqNytSWllqcW1yPXlaRERTZUFleVUwYTZpPV9DWnZNN19MZnBlelA1bnJzQ1JfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBRlpqNytSWllqcW1yPXlaRERTZUFleVUwYTZpPV9DWnZNN19MZnBlelA1bnJzQ1JfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70864,"nextInTopic":70866,"prevInTime":70864,"nextInTime":70866,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If your son woke up every day and played guitar all day, had his own website where people played guitar together, spent the rest of his time watching guitar","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1905548686\">If your son woke up every day and played guitar all day, had his own<br/>\nwebsite where people played guitar together, spent the rest of his time<br/>\nwatching guitar videos, toted his guitar around the house when he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nplaying, would you describe him as being &quot;addicted&quot; to guitar?

We downloaded the &#39;Technic&#39; launcher which has variations on Minecraft on there, and they have been trying out the different tools and versions and comparing what&#39;s different with each version.    They&#39;ve also started playing with other kids on servers, and our next step is to set up Skype so they can better communicate with all the new friends out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t play Minecraft, but I have played many other computer games in the past.    When the girls and I sit down to chat about stuff, they *love* to tell me about whatever new discoveries they&#39;ve made that day about Minecraft.  I have been *amazed* at what they&#39;ve been learning.  Currently, my 11 year old has been talking about wanting to make a &#39;trading place&#39; within the game, so that set us off talking about trading, and money systems, and we have started watching a documentary series together about economics, to give her idea of how her trading place might pan out.   There&#39;s been a steep learning curve for all of us when wondering together whether we can make our own server.  My younger daughter - who loves to watch videos of her favourite &#39;team&#39; undertaking challenges has been making all sorts of discoveries about group dynamics: how this (adult) person said this and that made that other person respond like this and why didn&#39;t he say it a different way? etc.   Fascinating.    Discussions about swearing and what some people might/might not find offensive have also come up, and I really welcomed that opportunity to discuss things - because I&#39;ve been wondering when that would come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things are in addition to all the more obvious in-game skills learning that you can find out about online.   It seems to me that the learning opportunities within Minecraft are pretty much endless.   It&#39;s a huge, whole world with limitless possibilities.   It also seems to me that the &#39;immersive&#39; element of it is just the same as being immersed in lego, but maybe even more understandable: they can build anything, with, or without other people joining in.   They can explore what other people on the other side of the world have built, too.   It&#39;s pretty amazing.   And, as I said, I don&#39;t play it myself, so that&#39;s probably just the tip of the iceberg.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure they have food and drinks to hand, sometimes I suggest something we can do together outside.   Not because I&#39;m trying to interrupt what they&#39;re doing (because it does feel a bit like an interruption) but because I&#39;m doing something that I think they will enjoy.   They usually choose to stop playing for a while and come and do the different thing with me: they know they can go back to Minecraft whenever they like.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps instead of suggesting things your children might like to do *instead* of the game, you could use what&#39;s going on with the game to suggest other things they may be interested in exploring?   With my daughters, any hint of: &quot;Why don&#39;t you stop doing that for a while and come and do this instead?&quot; is a recipe for disaster.   However, their current interest in Minecraft is a doorway through which we can explore in many different directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":526735221,"authorName":"haydee deldenovese","from":"haydee deldenovese &lt;shybarbie22@...&gt;","profile":"shybarbie22","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Minecraft support","postDate":"1362929918","msgId":70864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRlpqNytSWllqcW1yPXlaRERTZUFleVUwYTZpPV9DWnZNN19MZnBlelA1bnJzQ1JfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70861,"nextInTopic":70865,"prevInTime":70863,"nextInTime":70865,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ali I am still in the deschooling process and before we began to deschool, I had a media policy.

My children were not allowed to watch tv unless it was<br/>\nmovie night for the family, and they were certainly not allowed to play<br/>\ncomputer games.<br/>\n   When we began to deschool, I started to slowly let go of all those rules<br/>\nand restrictions, and now I do see my children feeling more in control with<br/>\nwhat they want to do. However (and I know a lot of parents will NOT agree<br/>\nwith this) I do have A rule when it comes time to the computer games. I<br/>\nhave a 7 and a 4 yr old, and the rule is that they are not allowed to play<br/>\nany games or whatch tv until they have had breakfast and brushed their<br/>\nteeth. I feel that at their age, they are waaaay too young to be looking at<br/>\na screen for endless hours, although if they want to, I don&#39;t say no.<br/>\n    What I have noticed is that with the bfst & teeth first rule, it allows<br/>\ntime for their little brains to fully wake up and think about the day.<br/>\nDuring that time I usually ask them what they would like to do, and add<br/>\nsome ideas to theirs, so they can make choices on what they would like to<br/>\ndo. There have been times when my son (4) wants to play in the computer<br/>\nfirst hand and days like that I let him, while I do dishes, sweep or brush<br/>\nand walk the dogs. Then once I&#39;m ready, I will offer him a drink that he<br/>\nmust have on the kitchen table (the computer is also in the kitchen, like a<br/>\nfoot away from the table) and at that moment I can have his attention and<br/>\nit is when I offer the next fun thing to do. Very excitedly I will say Oh,<br/>\nyour sister and I were thinking about going outside and look for rocks, or<br/>\nmake a fire, or whatever it may be. Most of the time, he will come with me<br/>\nand say can I finish my game later, mom? And I say of course, so I will<br/>\nsave it for him, and we have a great time doing other fun things. I always<br/>\nremind him that the computer and the game will ALWAYS be there, so he can<br/>\nalways get back to it.<br/>\n   I would say that in your situation, if your young boy is watching the<br/>\nbehavior of the oldest boys, it very well could be what he is learning. It<br/>\nmay be something he can use to relate to his sibblings, and he might enjoy<br/>\nit just as much, but at the age of 4, I feel like children can find the<br/>\nsimplest things so interesting and amusing, that all it takes is an<br/>\ninvitation to another world. Perhaps you can invite him outdoors with your<br/>\n2 yr old to act out some of the mindcraft games, and that might also help<br/>\nyou see what he is learning and picking up from the games. I am not<br/>\nfamiliar with mindcraft yet, but I would be a little concern as well, being<br/>\nthat he is sooo young.<br/>\n   I would suggest that you listen to your inner voice. As mothers we all<br/>\nhave that instinc, that internal mother voice that tells us when something<br/>\nis or isn&#39;t wrong, and I tnk that you should listen to that. Many other<br/>\nmoms like me will have our opinions, but I truly feel that deep down you<br/>\nknow exactly what feels right, and what would be best for him at this time.<br/>\nI know that as an unschooling parent we want our children to make the<br/>\nchoices and we want them to have their own voice, but I tnk that with all<br/>\nthat, we can also continue being a mom. In the wild, a mother lion will let<br/>\nher cub venture out and explore, but when she sees or feels danger,  she<br/>\nwill protect her young, at any cost. I don&#39;t think we are any different,<br/>\nand I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with wanting to take charge in<br/>\nparenting out young ones.<br/>\n   I wish you the best outcome both for you and your son...<br/>\nHaydee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":310848040,"authorName":"Ali Zeljo","from":"Ali Zeljo &lt;azeljo@...&gt;","profile":"azeljo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Minecraft support","postDate":"1362924897","msgId":70861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFRjVDMUI0LUQ0MkUtNEI3Qy04RkVDLTM3NzE3QjQ1OTlEMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70864,"prevInTime":70860,"nextInTime":70862,"topicId":70861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello.

I finally found Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, which led me here.  I have four sons.  They are 13,9,4,2.  For about a year, the oldest three have been playing Minecraft.  My question for you is about addiction to it.  Have any of you faced this issue?  My oldest child tends to get passionate about one thing and pursue it intensely for years.  His brothers tend to follow his lead.  For the first 6 years of his life it was basketball.  That was fun and easy to pursue with him.  The next 6-7 years were Lego.  Now the family is onto Minecraft.  This is the first time the passion looks like addiction at times and I&#39;m not sure what to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a mom, I&#39;ve learned that doing nothing at first is usually wise, observing and waiting-- usually things unravel and solve themselves.  My husband is getting upset.  I sometimes feel sick with worry. Here is a picture of our life these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe youngest player was 3 when he started.  He is a marvel- the tiny little fingers expertly controlling that boxy figure.  Now 4 years old, he wakes up in the morning and goes straight to the computer.  He has to check who is on Z-Craft (the boys run a public server).  Most days, he never stops playing or watching youtube videos of other people playing, the entire day.  If he does stop, it is because he is enticed by the 2 year old or by me into something fun- but never for more than a few minutes- gotta run back to the computer.  If we have to leave the house for any reason, he brings the laptop and plays single player in the car.  I bring him food, drinks, powercord.  He often Skypes with 10-12 year olds and plays Minecraft Hunger Games with them or discusses issues on Z-Craft.  I see him learning to read words, typing tons of commands, learning strategies, making friends...  This is a very deep place for him- he is SO young and has so much to learn from the opportunities it provides.  But his little face is getting so pale, sometimes even looks yellow.  And he is SO young!  There is a part of me that feels like he is missing out on the real world, these fabulous years of interacting with mommy!  I check in with him and ask him about what he&#39;s doing...but mostly I&#39;m engaged in playing with the 2 year old or doing household stuff with the 2 year old.  It is very easy to just leave him playing minecraft with his brothers while I do___ with the little guy.  Sometimes what we are doing looks SO interesting and fun that he wants to participate, but he seems to feel naked without the laptop, so he brings it and turns back to it every minute or two.   How do I decide if this is a problem that I need to do something about?  (Fear scenario running thru my head: HEADLINE: parents &quot;unschool&quot; kid and from age 3, he spends every waking minute gaming on Minecraft until he can no longer do anything else.  He is so addicted and entrenched in the Minecraft world, that his fingers can&#39;t leave the keyboard- even though he wants to do other things- the addiction is so strong, he cannot break away)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 9 & 13 year olds sleep later and roll out of bed and sit and stare for a while.  After talking with 4 year old about server issues, or new kits on MCPvp, they grab their computers and start to play. However, their lives are considerably more busy- a couple days a week they go to activities that they enjoy, they have friends who come over and entice them outside to play kickball, they play on sports teams and willingly get off Minecraft for games & practices.  Even still, they manage to play minecraft or watch minecraft videos for around 6 hours per day on busy days and on free days (3-4 per week) they play 12-14 hours or even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 4 & 13 year olds are mostly docile and sweet and easy.  But the 9 year old tends to get angry, loud, and violent.  These issues are scary for me.  So he is DETERMINED to win at this minecraft server that offers Hunger Games scenarios with 150 players- last one left alive wins.  This is entirely engaging to him.  He has won 11 times.  He wants to win 100 times. There is $ involved- they sell kits with powers and monthly fees for ranks.  He buys all these things.  The pattern has been that as the evening comes on, he gets more and more desperate to win one game!  He plays over and over, getting more and more heightened.  He cannot go to bed.  He must win!  He is getting so tired, everyone else in the house has fallen asleep.  He is still awake, trying again and again!  I wake up, I hear him crying!  He is SO tired.  He can&#39;t stop.  He keeps coming in second or third!  Why can&#39;t I win?  Sometimes he gives in to snuggling in bed with me at this point (usually 12:30-1am).  I am way too exhausted to stay up with him.  Other times he just keeps playing and I&#39;m not sure when he gets in bed!  ;(<br/>\n<br/>\n I sometimes sit next to him and watch.  He gets so explosive with a loss that he will lash out at whoever is near.  Just yesterday I could tell he was at explosion point and asked if he wanted to walk the dogs with me.  He said yes, but then as the game ended he jumped up and attacked me, his whole body shaking and eyes popping out.  I was scared and was grateful his body is still small enough that he can&#39;t truly hurt me!  He came on the walk and calmed down.  I explained how scary that attack was for me, and how scary and dangerous it is for his brothers when he does it to them.  He seems to take it in. We get home, he runs straight back to the computer to play more.  No more violent episodes that day.  Phew.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an addiction component?  Am I evolving into what I saw discussed a few days ago &quot;free range&quot; parenting?  Do I just let them play MC because it requires so little from me?!   Anyone else here struggling with similar issues?  I feel alone in this world, like everyone around me is not safe to talk to.  Who on earth thinks its ok to let a 4 year old on the computer all day?????<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for input and wisdom!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71365,"nextTopicId":71401}}
