Children receive their <br/>\nown Cruise News detailing daily events. A complimentary chef’s hat, also <br/>\nincluded in the program, is essential for creative cooking classes where <br/>\nchildren can make decorative pizzas or cookies.

One of three Bay Islands just off the coast of <br/>\nHonduras, Roatan is home to a mix of eight different cultures who share a <br/>\ncommon pride in their homeland. Just off shore, the pristine Belizean <br/>\nReef—teeming with marine life and some of the best pillar coral in the <br/>\nCaribbean—is considered one of the best dive destinations in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n    George Town, Grand Cayman Once a pirate stronghold and haven for <br/>\ndeserters <br/>\nfrom Oliver Cromwell&#39;s army, British Grand Cayman today is charming, <br/>\nprosperous and utterly civilized. Even though the famous Seven-Mile Beach is <br/>\nactually closer to six miles long, every inch of its golden sand is a treat. <br/>\nIn addition to duty-free shops filled with fine English porcelain and <br/>\ncrystal, the marvelous marine park system alone makes a visit here <br/>\nworthwhile. The Cayman Islands boast some of the wreck diving in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Cozumel, Mexico The beaches, dining and shopping are great on this tiny <br/>\ntropical isle just 12 miles off Mexico&#39;s coast. But it&#39;s the coral reef just <br/>\noff shore and the sacred Maya ruins that are the primary attractions. <br/>\nPalm-lined beaches throb with activity, while a dense jungle interior <br/>\nshowcases Cozumel&#39;s primeval side. Spectacular Palancar Reef, part of the <br/>\nsecond longest coral reef system in the world, beckons divers the world <br/>\nover.<br/>\n<br/>\nOptional Shore Excursions Available At Each Port!<br/>\n    Discover the Sugar and Spice of the Islands Whether your Caribbean <br/>\nvacation <br/>\nis a quick getaway or a romantic two-week tour of the islands, you won&#39;t <br/>\nwant to miss some of the hidden treasures on our exclusive Shore Excursions. <br/>\nThey can bring you to the depths of the ocean in an Atlantis submarine or to <br/>\nthe top of mountains to view ancient ruins and spectacular vistas.

The most economical way to travel is by booking two side by <br/>\nside or connecting cabins for your entire party. Many families on other <br/>\nsailings have opted to invite grandparents along to stay in the second <br/>\ncabin. Please be advised of this issue so that if you have more than 4 in <br/>\nyour family you can plan accordingly!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if you have 5 in your party, you will need a cabin for 3 and a <br/>\ncabin for 2.  If you have 6 in your party you can split it into two cabins <br/>\nfor 3 people, or put 2 in one cabin and 4 in the second one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe maximum occupancy they will allow in the inside and/or oceanview cabins <br/>\nis 4!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fwd: Unschooler&#39;s Cruise","postDate":"1063817606","msgId":16330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyLjM0YjIzM2QyLjJjOTllYjg2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16331,"prevInTime":16329,"nextInTime":16331,"topicId":16330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My friend Wendy is booking an unschooler s cruise.
