They&#39;re not even in class <br/>\nsix hours a day, unless they have a seven-period day.  Classes are generally <br/>\n50 minutes.  Of that, the first five or more are roll call and announcements, <br/>\nthen there&#39;s assignment and getting organized and answering questions.  Most <br/>\nof the kids are not paying attention because they already know the material, <br/>\nor because they don&#39;t understand it and don&#39;t want to.  MAYBE five people <br/>\nwill be learning for five or ten minutes apiece.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lucky, attentive kid might learn for an hour in a typical secondary school <br/>\nweek.<br/>\nSome kids learn NOTHING in a week, or a month.  All of them learn to resent <br/>\nteachers and to avoid learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not exaggerating at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: My Ramble","postDate":"1016585348","msgId":5579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOC5lNTEzMWUxLjI5YzkzNjg0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5586,"prevInTime":5578,"nextInTime":5580,"topicId":5579,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 03/19/2002 5:19:28 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

I think he freaks <br/>\nwhen he talks to his mother, who is a retired teacher and always hated me <br/>\nanyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, though, Julian, 12, has had an academic burst of energy, and is doing <br/>\na cool set of courses through a weekend high school enrichment program at MIT <br/>\nAND teaching himself high school chemistry with a CD-ROM he asked me to buy <br/>\nhim. Now Grandma and Dad can just reassure himself that Julian is Gifted, so <br/>\nhe&#39;s okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe sort of shrug and decided it was all in how you market it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5677,"nextTopicId":5725}}
