He is <br/>\nsomeone who thinks everything out loud.  He would be talking about an issue.  <br/>\nDoesn&#39;t really matter, here, what his point of view is or what the subject <br/>\nis. I would present the counter argument.  Or just something to add to the <br/>\nmix for him to think about.  He would pause for a minute to think about that <br/>\nand then start thinking out loud again.  It is just so wonderful to see him <br/>\nprocessing all the information and formulating his own ideas and opinions no <br/>\nmatter what my opinion on the subject might be.  Very political and <br/>\nfascinating.<br/>\nPam G.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12718,"nextTopicId":12773}}
