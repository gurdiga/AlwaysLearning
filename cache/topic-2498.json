I remember years ago, long before I had kids, <br/>\nI had a job where I had to interview people for ? not sure what you call <br/>\nit in the US? government benefits? support payments? for unemployed <br/>\npeople and solo mothers. I was interviewing a woman when her baby <br/>\nstarted to cry, whereupon she undid her shirt completely, and sat there <br/>\nwith both breasts exposed, nursing the baby on one side and letting the <br/>\nmilk drip from the other breast onto the forms she was completing, which <br/>\nI then had to take for processing. I found that extremely offensive at <br/>\nthe time, and still feel that it was an act of deliberate aggression <br/>\nagainst &#39;the enemy&#39; as she appeared from other behaviour to believe we <br/>\nwere. I was 19yo. at the time. I think after that experience it is a <br/>\nmiracle that I went on to nurse 4 sons, tandem nurse, nurse one son <br/>\nthrough to age five etc etc and become a LLL leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my second son was little, we were flooded out of our tent in a <br/>\nflash flood in a camping ground. I was sitting on a chair in the kitchen <br/>\nvery discretely nursing our 4month old baby, when an elderly man came in <br/>\nand made his cup of tea and toast for breakfast. Just as he was about to <br/>\nleave, he looked at me and then asked (he had to ask, as there was <br/>\nnothing to see), if I was nursing the baby. When I said yes, he went <br/>\nwild, told me to go to my tent. I explained it was flooded, so he told <br/>\nme to go and nurse in the toilet (? bathroom?). I told him I&#39;d nurse the <br/>\nbaby in the &#39;ladies&#39; if he went and ate his breakfast in the &#39;mens&#39;, but <br/>\notherwise, I was staying put.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a pretty stroppy woman when it comes to defending my rights, or <br/>\nthose of my children, but doen&#39;t believe it is necessary or polite or <br/>\nrespectful to blatantly rub those rights in other peoples faces <br/>\nunnecessarily. Many people do find the sight of naked breasts <br/>\ndisturbing. Even people who, in their head, know it is all natural, <br/>\nstill find it uncomfortable. Can&#39;t we ask that they be respected where <br/>\nthere is no hardship to us, or our babies, in the process?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But really, I was thinking this statement was<br/>\n&gt; like me telling Lexie to &quot;be careful&quot; when<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s pooring the milk or crossing the<br/>\n&gt; street.  Of course she&#39;s careful, why woudl<br/>\n&gt; she not be.  it&#39;s more like it&#39;s belittling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She wouldn&#39;t be careful if she had no notion of the possible <br/>\nconsequences (didn&#39;t understand the dangers of traffic), or didn&#39;t care <br/>\nabout the consequences (had never had to clean up the mess, had never <br/>\ngone stinky from rotten milk on unwashed clothes), OR just didn&#39;t care <br/>\nenough about other people to worry that someone else might dislike <br/>\nhaving to clean up, or be in the presence of a rotten-milk-stinky person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the notice needs to be given at all, presumably it means that there <br/>\nare people who attend LLL conferences who are either not aware of the <br/>\ndiscomfort others may feel at the sight of breasts / nursing babies, or <br/>\nwho don&#39;t care. Then LLL needs to decide whether it wants to promote <br/>\nbreastfeeding in the community, or whether it wants to just say, &#39;we <br/>\nknow this is best, stuff you if you don&#39;t like it&#39;. Yeah, I know that&#39;s <br/>\nnot what you are saying, but I can also see how it could be interpreted <br/>\nthat way by people who are not LLL minded.<br/>\n<br/>\n So I guess I am trying to say: 1) I think babies should be nursed when <br/>\nand where they need it, 2) I agree that some people will be offended no <br/>\nmatter what you do, and well, tough, that sort will just have to suffer <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;, 3) I think if we want to encourage acceptance of breastfeeding, we <br/>\nneed also to encourage respect for others feelings, especially where <br/>\nthere be no need for conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\nNew Zealand</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2533,"nextTopicId":2542}}
