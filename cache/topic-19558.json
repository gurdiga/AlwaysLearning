(red, white and blue, my youngest <br/>\nchild&#39;s favorite color scheme)  I took one apart and scanned the face into the <br/>\ncomputer.

Questions were asked and answered.  <br/>\nThey were located in a place where no other clocks could be seen, so it <br/>\nhappened that even the adults in the house came to rely on them to get the time.  <br/>\nEventually, Will asked enough questions and did enough studying of the clock <br/>\nfaces that he just knew how to tell time on any clock, and no one even noticed <br/>\nwhen it happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe clocks are now propped up on a bookshelf in my living room, sorta <br/>\nDali-ish and I still refer to them once a week or so when I need the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Hi group/ software question","postDate":"1084375054","msgId":19559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJiLjU3MmZjMTA4LjJkZDM5YTBlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19558,"nextInTopic":19560,"prevInTime":19558,"nextInTime":19560,"topicId":19558,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/12/04 12:55:50 AM, willsmamamillie@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-692057906\">In a message dated 5/12/04 12:55:50 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willsmamamillie@...\">willsmamamillie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  He has been very interested in time for a while now, and is trying to <br/>\nlearn to read an analog clock, though I am not quite sure he how to explain to <br/>\nhim that the 4 means 20, for example.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShow him the minute-marks.

I am Millie; my son is Will.  He is only 2 years old, but he is definitely unschooling; I have always just followed his inclinations and helped him with what he has wanted to learn.  He wanted to learn letters well before his first birthday and at 14 months started recognizing words.  He is reading now, hundreds of words by sight (including state and country names and all kinds of stuff I would never have expected a 2 year old to want to know), and starting to have success in sounding out words he does not know.   He learned all about the solar system last year and continues to search out new information, and is now interested in different types of spacecraft.  He is working hard to learn maps, and knows about half of the states and I would guess 40% of countries.  This is HIM learning this, it is not like I have ever said to him, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s learn this.&quot;  He just gets interested, asks<br/>\n millions of questions, and learns.  He has been very interested in time for a while now, and is trying to learn to read an analog clock, though I am not quite sure he how to explain to him that the 4 means 20, for example. <br/>\n      Anyway, we have just gotten this computer and he absolutely wants to use it.  I have let him mess around on Word (he just types rows of letters, etc...and apparently sometime when my back was turned messed w the settings).  So, though 2 seems awfully young to be using the computer (but then it is also young for reading), I think I need to go get some software for him.  I looked at the Sam&#39;s club and everything I saw seemed to be, like ABC and color drills.  I definitely don&#39;t want to buy anything like that for him.  I would like to find something open-ended, creative....I guess a game?  I don&#39;t know...does anyone have any suggestions for a good first program?<br/>\n    Sorry to be so long...I look forward to getting to know all of you.<br/>\n    Millie Rosa<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
