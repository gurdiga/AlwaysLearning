First, the safety of life, the hold my hand, slow down when you<br/>\n&gt; eat, small pieces please, watch the street then cross, two hands on the<br/>\n&gt; scooter. At some point along the way, these little people really do know how<br/>\n&gt; to be responsible. I see it with Tessa, almost 3 on some things, alot with<br/>\n&gt; Riley, 5.5, and Ashley at almost 8 seems to know how to be in the world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now I was controlling Tessa. She is playing with homemade playdough we<br/>\n&gt; cooked up about 45 minutes ago. She wants to mix in more flour. I told her <br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; had enough. Why? Two reasons, I see a potential mess I get to clean up and <br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; will make the playdough too dry. My deal. I gave her more flour and told her<br/>\n&gt; sorry for not listening right away. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Controlling the kids seems to creep into our lives so easily. I hear parents<br/>\n&gt; all the time telling kids not to do this or that at the playground. Throwing<br/>\n&gt; sand yes, but climbing up the slide when no one else is playing on it does <br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; seem reasonable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like this discussion,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mary H.

Makes it difficult sometimes to do exciting crowd<br/>\n&gt; activities, like fairs and festivals, yet boy do we have fun on our own in <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; woods and beaches. I also have learned to ts=ake the kids to group things <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; another family and ask Tim if he wants to join us.

I do know that it took well over a year before he would<br/>\neven<br/>\nlet me read to him again.  He still refuses anything that looks academic<br/>\nbut<br/>\nhe IS learning in leaps and bounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach loves to play pool and baseball.  He completely understands how<br/>\nforces<br/>\nact on objects and how that makes the objects behave.  So he understands<br/>\na<br/>\nlot of physics just doesn&#39;t use words like torsion and friction, instead<br/>\nwe<br/>\ntalk about &quot;putting English on the ball&quot; or &quot;banking the shot&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is not a pleasure reader but did spend a lot of time up in his room<br/>\nuntil he figured out how to read a Dr. Zeus book.  I was so surprised<br/>\nwhen<br/>\nhe proudly offered to read it to me.  He likes to do math problems in<br/>\nhis<br/>\nhead for fun.  He will just ask out of the blue &quot;Does 8 plus 8 equal<br/>\n16?&quot;<br/>\nYes.  &quot;Then 9 plus 9 is 18, right?&quot;  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have noticed though is the sure way to guarantee Zach will clam<br/>\nup is<br/>\nto try to educate or pressure him in any way.  He is still very<br/>\nsensitive to<br/>\nthe pain that schooling caused him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I suggest simply have fun with your son.  Don&#39;t do &quot;field trips&quot; but<br/>\njust go hang out at the zoo with your son, like you would with anybody<br/>\nthat<br/>\nyou like to spend time with.  Play.  Go shopping.  Build a tree house.<br/>\nJust<br/>\ndo fun stuff and make sure that you are allowing him to be fully<br/>\ninvolved,<br/>\nthat you are not taking over (like good homeschool moms are very capable<br/>\nof<br/>\ndoing).  But most of all, just breathe, relax and remember that life<br/>\nreally<br/>\nis good.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-35008801\">Hi Lisa,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds, now 9, went to school for less than 4 months in Kindergarten, then<br/>\ncame home for a year of school-at-home before we finally found unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I can ever make up to Zach what I did to him by trying to<br/>\neducate him.  I do know that it took well over a year before he would even<br/>\nlet me read to him again.  He still refuses anything that looks academic but<br/>\nhe IS learning in leaps and bounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach loves to play pool and baseball.  He completely understands how forces<br/>\nact on objects and how that makes the objects behave.  So he understands a<br/>\nlot of physics just doesn&#39;t use words like torsion and friction, instead we<br/>\ntalk about &quot;putting English on the ball&quot; or &quot;banking the shot&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is not a pleasure reader but did spend a lot of time up in his room<br/>\nuntil he figured out how to read a Dr. Zeus book.  I was so surprised when<br/>\nhe proudly offered to read it to me.  He likes to do math problems in his<br/>\nhead for fun.  He will just ask out of the blue &quot;Does 8 plus 8 equal 16?&quot;<br/>\nYes.  &quot;Then 9 plus 9 is 18, right?&quot;  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have noticed though is the sure way to guarantee Zach will clam up is<br/>\nto try to educate or pressure him in any way.  He is still very sensitive to<br/>\nthe pain that schooling caused him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I suggest simply have fun with your son.  Don&#39;t do &quot;field trips&quot; but<br/>\njust go hang out at the zoo with your son, like you would with anybody that<br/>\nyou like to spend time with.  Play.  Go shopping.  Build a tree house.  Just<br/>\ndo fun stuff and make sure that you are allowing him to be fully involved,<br/>\nthat you are not taking over (like good homeschool moms are very capable of<br/>\ndoing).  But most of all, just breathe, relax and remember that life really<br/>\nis good.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9453,"nextTopicId":9444}}
