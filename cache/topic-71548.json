I helped two different<br/>\nolder people in my community settle estates, which led to me learning how<br/>\nto sell items on ebay, and I did that for many years. I know about managing<br/>\nrental property, so I&#39;ve helped people get property ready for rental, set<br/>\nup leases and screened tenants for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes these activities were not completely run out of my house, but I<br/>\ncould bring my children with me and set my own schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I always did first, before deciding I needed to add to our income, is<br/>\nfigure out if there were things we could do without. There are almost<br/>\nalways ways to cut costs - for many years we bought almost all of our<br/>\nclothes second-hand, we rarely ate out, we didn&#39;t have cable, we didn&#39;t<br/>\ntravel, we postponed work on our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used the library (books, music, DVDs, museum passes, free programs),<br/>\nattended a UU church that had activities for children, visited parks,<br/>\njoined 4H and kept two rabbits, we had two wonderful cats that really<br/>\nenriched the girl&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help offset costs for paid activities I sometimes acted as the<br/>\ninstructor&#39;s assistant and then my child participated for free (this worked<br/>\nfor a few NH Audubon programs) or asked if I could set up a payment plan.<br/>\nFor five summers both girls participated in a Shakespeare theater program -<br/>\nI helped with publicity and ran front-of-house in exchange for tuition<br/>\nforgiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s looking at your situation with different eyes and seeing the<br/>\npossibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Cara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332164648,"authorName":"Rippy Dusseldorp","from":"&quot;Rippy Dusseldorp&quot; &lt;ripgray@...&gt;","profile":"rdusseldorp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Earning extra money","postDate":"1370510061","msgId":71554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtvcGp0ZCs5bTVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNzA0OTAxODEuOTYzNTQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MjEwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71553,"nextInTopic":71555,"prevInTime":71553,"nextInTime":71555,"topicId":71548,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Thank you, that first link is the one I was thinking of!

For example, you may be able to help out in the class in someway instead of making a financial payment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children were younger, I made alternative arrangements with a couple of different facilitators. For a weekly crafts workshop, the facilitator was happy with me coming early to help her set up the craft tables, make tea and chat, while my children played. After the class was finished, I&#39;d help with clean up, wrapping children&#39;s crafts up to take home and chat more with the facilitator. She was happy with the company and the extra assistance. I was happy that we could do the classes for free. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt other times I&#39;ve offered to make a brochure or a website or help advertise different activities for people. A website is very easy to design with something like wordpress and it is free. We&#39;ve got software that makes designing brochures a breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t done any of this professionally. I suppose I could.
