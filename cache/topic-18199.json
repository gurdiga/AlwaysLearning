In a couple months Justin my 6 year old <br/>\nwill be having surgery. This is a BIG surgery he will be in the <br/>\nhospital for about 2 weeks. The last week will not be a big deal <br/>\nbecause he will be able to go to the art room BUT the first week he <br/>\nwill be IN bed. Cheyenne at 4 yo had the same surgery it is awful.<br/>\nThey can not eat for at LEAST 7-10 days. <br/>\nI REALLY REALLY, for my own sanity, need some fresh ideas to keep him <br/>\noccupied. This is a child that snacks ALL day. HE is ALWAYS hungry <br/>\nand he is going to get bored watching movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep in mind he may not be able to sit up or even hold a <br/>\npen/crayon. Cheyenne has had several surgeries but at 2-3 years old <br/>\nshe was content with movies.<br/>\nWe also must travel to Michigan and we are in St. louis. I LOVE LOVE <br/>\nLOVE traveling with my kids it is SO much fun, but when it is for <br/>\nsurgery it is a little more stressfull for all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18193,"nextTopicId":18142}}
