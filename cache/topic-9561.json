Uh, I don&#39;t think WA is all that cold<br/>\nthough.  Where do you live, Tahiti?  LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Straw Bale, we are students of Natural<br/>\nBuilding.  That includes a lot of different techniques<br/>\nwhich we intend to use in hybrid combinations as<br/>\nfitting for each site, available materials, choices of<br/>\nthe builders/homeowners, and season in which each is<br/>\nbuilt.  They include: strawbale, recycled plastic or<br/>\npaper bale, cob, adobe, rammed earth and earth<br/>\nberming, round wood and raw wood, cord wood, ferro<br/>\ncement, earthship methods, and others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe earth bermed cottage I mentioned is on a slight<br/>\nslope and the berming is on the side where the cottage<br/>\nis being cut into the slope of the hill.  The<br/>\nreamaining walls will likely be cob, or a combination<br/>\nof cob and other materials.  Cob is an adobe like<br/>\nprocess, where the material is sculpted in place<br/>\ninstead of dried as bricks first.  That is what all<br/>\nthose whitewashed, thatch roofed cottages in the UK<br/>\nare made of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCob has terrific thermal mass, similar concerns to<br/>\nfooting and roof (boots and hat) to strawbale, and is<br/>\nvery condusive to curvilinear construction, sculpted<br/>\narchitectural details, built in benches, shelves, etc,<br/>\nand injecting personality into the design.  You can<br/>\ninset a piece of glass into cob and sculpt the cob<br/>\ninto any shape you want around it for a non opening<br/>\nwindow.  You can even build an &quot;adobe&quot; type oven into<br/>\nthe cob, to heat a home with.  The thermal mass makes<br/>\nit function great for slow burns, and slow release of<br/>\nstored heat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe favor cob for the reasons above, as well as the<br/>\nfact that it stands up well to damp climates like<br/>\nIreland, Devonshire, Wales and New Zealand.  Cob homes<br/>\nhave been continuously occupied in places in the UK<br/>\nfor over 500 years.  It is untouched by earthquakes,<br/>\nand totally fireproof as well.  It is structually self<br/>\nsupporting, drying to an almost concrete hardness, but<br/>\ncan be cut later with a power saw if you need to add<br/>\nonto a house, etc.  It&#39;s very versatile, extremely low<br/>\nimpact environmentally, great thermally, and very<br/>\ncheap to build.  All you need is the appropriate<br/>\nportions of sand, clay and straw mixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more passion of mine.
