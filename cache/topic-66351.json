It was really hard at times, especially at night when I would get the real skin-crawly aversion feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided that her need to breastfeed was more important than my discomfort, but I did need to put some pretty firm boundaries in place.  Here&#39;s what we did:<br/>\n<br/>\n- night weaned when she was about 2 and a half.  I tried earlier but it was too distressing. My husband would cuddle and walk her if she needed it to get back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I would also feed for as long as I could and then do a countdown, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll count down from ten and then Mi is finished&quot;.  Sometimes it would be &quot;till the end of this song&quot; or &quot;when we finish this book&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I wouldn&#39;t offer, but I would try to say yes whenever she requested.<br/>\n<br/>\n- we talked about how there would be lots of milk there again when the baby came and then they could both have mi.  I ended up tandem feeding for two years, although after the first weeks, not with both of them together as it brought up the same aversion feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read &#39;Adventures in Tandem Nursing&#39; by Hilary Flowers?  That&#39;s a really good one.  And I get the feeling you might be in Australia, are you a member of ABA?  I found going to their support groups really helpful, as there were people there who had successfully fed through pregnancy and beyond.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the sores on the nipple, do you know why that&#39;s happened?  Is your son&#39;s latch degrading?  If he&#39;s correctly latched there shouldn&#39;t be actual damage done, even if you&#39;re pregnant.  Again, the ABA might be able to help, or LLL if you&#39;re not in Australia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really glad I continued through pregnancy and beyond.  My daughters have a beautiful bond, I remember them holding hands as they both fed, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related, but Abi is incredibly loving, gentle and understanding with Evie.  One of my main reasons for wanting to tandem feed was so that Abi didn&#39;t feel completely displaced and so that we could keep our connection, especially as breastfeeding was always really important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\nMother to Abigail, 5 and Evangeline, 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;avitaljourney&quot; &lt;avitaljourney@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I looking for some advise on comfort breastfeeding and peaceful ways of working through this.

But, otherwise, the worst thing that can happen here is<br/>\nthat some people strongly disagree with you and respond with criticisms of<br/>\nwhatever you said. That&#39;s the worst! And even if that happens, you would<br/>\nhave said what you wanted to say and a couple of thousand people (probably)<br/>\nwould have read it and they can decide for themselves what they think about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND if it happens that people do critique what you said or how you said it,<br/>\nthen you get a great opportunity to examine it yourself from a different<br/>\nperspective. That is a good thing. If we can get over being defensive, it<br/>\nreally helps us learn and grow. It is unlikely that you have friends or<br/>\nrelatives who are going to critique you in that way and it is a gift to be<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this gift is offered to people who don&#39;t expect or want it feels<br/>\npersonal and hurtful to them. So we try, on this list, to be as clear as we<br/>\ncan possibly be that we are here for the purpose of engaging in active<br/>\ncritical analysis of any and all ideas posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times I think the criticisms are completely off-base. There are<br/>\ntimes I think the critiquer has misunderstood the original poster&#39;s idea.<br/>\nThere are times I think the critiques could be offered in more helpful ways<br/>\n- explained more, been a little gentler, been a little more to the point,<br/>\netc. In other words, there are times I feel the urge to critique the<br/>\ncritiques. But I resist that urge. I have learned to accept and appreciate<br/>\nthat there are different ways of expressing ideas and that what seems<br/>\nbrilliant to me might seem worthless to someone else. I have learned, over<br/>\ntime, whose ideas are generally most useful to me and I tend to pay more<br/>\nattention to those and less to others. I have learned that what I have to<br/>\nsay will not be appreciated by everyone and that no matter how good my own<br/>\nintentions, there will be people who take offense to the exact same posts<br/>\nthat other people appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also learned that people often do not read carefully. They very<br/>\noften skim and don&#39;t see qualifiers. When I say, for example, &quot;Maybe you<br/>\nshould consider that your stepson might be angry about the divorce and<br/>\nblame you, &quot; a person will respond angrily and defensively about what a<br/>\ngreat relationship she has with her stepchild. But the word &quot;maybe&quot; at the<br/>\nbeginning of that sentence means what it says - &quot;maybe&quot; this is something<br/>\nyou should consider - maybe. It doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m accusing her of being a<br/>\nbad stepmother - it means that this is an idea to consider, that he might<br/>\npossibly be angry. That seems a lot better advice than saying, &quot;I&#39;m sure<br/>\nyou are a wonderful stepmother and he&#39;s got no reason for behaving the way<br/>\nhe is.&quot; What good does that do?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know of anywhere else outside of a therapeutic relationship where<br/>\nyou can get this kind of direct, critical, and honest feedback. Over the<br/>\nyears, I have very often been amazed at the insights expressed here. I have<br/>\nsometimes reacted emotionally and felt something was harshly said, and I<br/>\nhave felt defensive, but it is worth it to take the risk and learn to get<br/>\nover it. I have learned SO much about myself and relationships and<br/>\nparenting and, really, about living, through the interactions here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7630759,"authorName":"Mary Kocak","from":"&quot;Mary Kocak&quot; &lt;Mary_K@...&gt;","profile":"marymom2three","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Breastfeeding for comfort","postDate":"1332607467","msgId":66410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE5MkIxMjU0OEY2NzQ2RThCQUM3NDVGODEwN0M2RUY3QE1hcnk+","referencesHeader":"PGpraHE0citjMmQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66370,"nextInTopic":66414,"prevInTime":66409,"nextInTime":66411,"topicId":66351,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new here and I am almost afraid to post.

Afraid I might say something wrong.  I really felt the need to share my own experience and thoughts on this though.  When you believe in child lead weaning and need or want to stop for any reason it&#39;s a big decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through something similar when I had to wean my son when I was pregnant.  Don&#39;t offer the breast and try to watch his signals for when he might want to suckle and distract before it happens.  Those sores on your nipples need time to heal before the new baby comes or this might interfere with your new nursing relationship.  As you well know, nursing is a very personal relationship.   There are two people involved in this relationship and they BOTH need to want to continue it.  If you are beginning to feel resentful then it may be time for you to stop.<br/>\nI knew it was time for me to end it, only you know when that time comes for you.  <br/>\nI think it took my son about a week to stop asking for the breast but he was down to only a few times a day already.  In my experience it was easier to distract him with something that didn&#39;t include cuddling.  If I tried to sit and read a book or something he would try to get in my shirt so my distractions usually involved getting up and physically doing something.  Usually he would want to nurse around the time he was ready for a nap so it would be a quiet activity like a puzzle or something and I would tell him that we could cuddle but he couldn&#39;t have a meemee.  He would get mad and frustrated and once again I would try to calmly distract him.  He didn&#39;t always stay calm but I had to be persistent.  I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore, it was no longer a mutually rewarding relationship and I felt he was picking up on my negative feelings. <br/>\nI wish I could remember more about how I distracted him.   This was over 11 years ago.<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall every telling him it was because I was pregnant.  I didn&#39;t want to make him feel this relationship was ending because of the impending arrival of a new sibling.  I think it took about a week, maybe less.  Kevin seemed to just forget about nursing until after the new baby arrived.  One day shortly after I brought Kolton home he asked to nurse and I let him try.  He didn&#39;t even remember how. It was kind of sad and kind of funny at the same time.  He pulled my shirt down, patted my breast and walked away and never asked again.  I remember that moment like it was yesterday.<br/>\nDon&#39;t stress yourself out if you feel it needs to come to an end.  Try not to feel guilty because you think he may not be quite ready to give it up.  Only you and your child know when it&#39;s time for this part of your relationship to end.  It was wonderful while it lasted but we can&#39;t nurse them forever (sigh, if only they stayed babies a bit longer).<br/>\nPlease do whatever you have to to get those sores healed.  I have had breast infections twice.  I was in so much pain and so sick.  I can&#39;t imagine how hard that would be if I had a newborn to take care of on top of one of those infections.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept getting distracted while typing this.  I hope it&#39;s coherent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: avitaljourney <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 23, 2012 8:26 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Breastfeeding for comfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  I looking for some advise on comfort breastfeeding and peaceful ways of working through this.

I&#39;m glad I did,<br/>\noverall.   I think what helped during pregnancy was deep breathing and<br/>\ncounting.  It seemed the nursings took a very long time, but in all<br/>\nactuality, it wasn&#39;t very long.  If I was reallllllly not wanting to nurse,<br/>\nI distracted my daughter with something else -- a game, special food,<br/>\noutside, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNighttime was hard, no doubt. Even though it was hard, I personally felt<br/>\nlike night weaning at that time would have been more difficult for my<br/>\ndaughter than the hardship it was on me to continue nursing.

Perhaps it won&#39;t be so painful once you have milk again, and it might be a really nice thing to look forward to which is directly connected to his new baby brother or sister. In the meantime, whilst your breast isn&#39;t an option, try to find something else which he likes which he can use instead. A dummy maybe?, or a sensory necklace, or your finger???<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all the best,<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: avitaljourney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avitaljourney@...\">avitaljourney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, 23 March 2012, 12:26<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Breastfeeding for comfort<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nI looking for some advise on comfort breastfeeding and peaceful ways of working through this.
