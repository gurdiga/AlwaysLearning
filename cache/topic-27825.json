I&#39;ll share this with them.  They really  have been poster  <br/>\nchildren for another way of being.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty went to a school dance last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s about to start training on a job that said you have to have a  <br/>\nhigh school diploma or a GED; he has neither.  He&#39;s the only one who  <br/>\npassed all the &quot;tests&quot; (informal)  and interviews to do the World of  <br/>\nWarcraft customer support.  The rest of them who applied when he did  <br/>\nwill be doing support for other companies than Blizzard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was participating in a weekly discussion of medieval virtues,  <br/>\nand though she would only say two or three things in a two hour  <br/>\nsession, her comments were better than most of those others present.   <br/>\nWhen the young (22 year old) wife of one of the participants wanted  <br/>\nto start coming, I was talking about it with one of my best regulars  <br/>\nand said &quot;I&#39;d like to say she&#39;s too young or new to the group, but  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s there.&quot;  He said &quot;Yeah, but Holly&#39;s like 30.&quot;  (She&#39;s 15.  He  <br/>\nknows.  He meant to say she&#39;s as mature in that type of discussion as  <br/>\nif she were 30, which is too flattering, but still...  she does  <br/>\nunderstand the subject matter better than the 22 year old graduate  <br/>\nstudent does sometimes.)  But now Holly has a Wednesday night  <br/>\nbabysitting job, so she&#39;s unable to come to the discussions, which is  <br/>\nfine because she was going to quit when Lost starts back up in a  <br/>\ncouple of weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese kids are just not &quot;at their spot&quot; on the conveyor belt.   <br/>\nThey&#39;re &quot;ahead&quot; some and &quot;behind&quot; some and &quot;beyond&quot; some and  <br/>\n&quot;oblivious&quot; some (to traditions concerning school dances, for  <br/>\ninstance &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in every case, they have had the information they&#39;ve requested or  <br/>\nthat came up naturally in the course of their wanting to know things,  <br/>\nor coming across a new activity or topic, or choosing to pursue  <br/>\nsomething or other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t invite Holly to that philosophy discussion.  We meet in a  <br/>\nrestaurant that&#39;s walking distance, and one night she was hungry and  <br/>\nwanted to go eat and then go home.  She stayed.  She came back.   She  <br/>\nwas curious about what we were doing, and she likes some of the  <br/>\npeople there.  Marty goes now too.  Marty&#39;s friend Brett started  <br/>\ngoing.  He first planned to come for the first hour and then go to  <br/>\nour house for Kirby&#39;s D&D game.  As it turned out, he goes to the D&D  <br/>\ngame late.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I suggested to any of these kids that they should attend a  <br/>\nphilosophy discussion that I run, or MADE them go, their being there  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be nearly the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve rambled away from the original question, but I&#39;m still in the  <br/>\nrealm of the quality and value of information that is shared when   <br/>\nthe listener is interested or  needs to know, and when the listener  <br/>\nis free to stay or go, free to change the subject or to ask about  <br/>\nsomething altogether different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s cool to say that all my kids have jobs.  Except for campus work- <br/>\nstudy jobs (filing cards for the bursar, and working in the  <br/>\ncafeteria) I didn&#39;t have a job until I was 20 years old.   Kirby has  <br/>\nworked since he was 14, and Marty since he was 15.  Holly&#39;s 15 and  <br/>\ngot a very good babysitting job, regular through May.  (Whether it  <br/>\nwill continue after that isn&#39;t important to her.)  People are happy  <br/>\nwith their work and their presence.   We didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them get jobs  <br/>\nor even suggest it, in any of those cases.  (I did let Holly know  <br/>\nabout the babysitting job, but I didn&#39;t say &quot;Look for a babysitting  <br/>\njob.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m ramblng, but there are some more ideas for the collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Giving information","postDate":"1170005491","msgId":27851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDMDMxRjU4LTA1RDUtNDYzQS05NDZELURFNjExNDNFRUEyQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMmQwMWM3NDJhZiRiMTViNzcyMCRlMmUxMWZkM0BraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4=","referencesHeader":"PGVwZTRiaCtqZDQ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUFCM0I1RDYtOUYyNS00OTg2LTk2MTMtQUEzNUUwOEUzOTZDQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MDAyZDAxYzc0MmFmJGIxNWI3NzIwJGUyZTExZmQzQGtpbThjZThhZjM1NDNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":27847,"nextInTopic":27852,"prevInTime":27850,"nextInTime":27852,"topicId":27825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Oh they read it alright!

She thought it was interesting.  Didn&#39;t remember the scene <br/>\nand wants us to watch it when she gets out of the ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it has occurred to me that this is not the first time I have <br/>\ndone this.  When a thought pops into my head like this how do I know <br/>\nwhen to suppress it (not share it) or when it is ok to share. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the answer is &quot;It Depends&quot; - again.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously this time worked very well since the child was interested and<br/>\nresponded well. If the response had been any kind of blanking, irritation or<br/>\nsaying any variation of &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear about that&quot; then presumably<br/>\nyou would stop talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (7) says &quot;I don&#39;t want to know about that&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t tell me&quot; pretty<br/>\ndarn clearly at times. I have learnt to ask her if she wants to hear more<br/>\nabout something. I will say something like, &quot;I know something about ...&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;That reminds me of something. Do you want me to tell you about it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn her particular case she will say &quot;yes&quot; I&#39;m guesstimating probably about<br/>\nhalf the time. (Time for me to make a note of these occurrences so that I<br/>\ncan speak with more certainty.) Just to clarify this is in the absence of<br/>\nJayn asking questions (which I always answer until I see that she is<br/>\nsatisfied).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been some times when I have been really glad that I did NOT say<br/>\nanything, because I would have deprived Jayn of a wonderful moment of<br/>\nconnection and self-discovery. There have been many times when she has taken<br/>\nsomething that I mentioned briefly and gone even further with it. To use<br/>\nyour example as an analogy, Jayn and I would watch the movie I remembered,<br/>\nand then she might remember another movie herself, or a time at the<br/>\naquarium, or some other thing that happened at the beach or..... <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is a question of receptivity, and also how likely the child would<br/>\nbe to come across the information herself in the continuing course of her<br/>\nplay. Jayn delights me with her ability to notice and express connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also a question of intention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine is never to make sure Jayn knows something or other. It is always to<br/>\nenhance her experience and our relationship. Therefore if I am offering her<br/>\nsome information it is in order to let her know I support or share her<br/>\ninterest - even if it is something as ephemeral as air bubbles in the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
