Now that I think about <br/>\nit, my other son, who was in school at this age, was always doing stuff <br/>\nlike that.

I&#39;m holding the paper up and he keys in on activity <br/>\n2, the fill in the blank one.  All the clues are such:  A mammal which <br/>\nis spotted.  [blank].  He does activity 2 first and enjoys it.  I help <br/>\nhim spell porcupine  Then we talked about activity 1, which is the <br/>\nsentences...and he really thought that all his sentences should start <br/>\nlike the clues in activity 2.

He asked me and asked me (which is one of his special traits) <br/>\nand I realized he needed &quot;permission&quot; to go ahead and be creative.  So I <br/>\nfinally stopped and held up his picture frame and showed him every <br/>\nportion that he was &quot;allowed&quot; to paint, which of course, was every <br/>\nportion of the frame, and I showed which colors he could use, which of <br/>\ncourse, was every color.  He went happily on his way.  I understand that <br/>\nConnor needs some kind of special handling, and that this is probably <br/>\nmore normal than not for a kid in school, but I don&#39;t want Will to have <br/>\neven an *inkling* of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I feel all pepped up, listened to, and understood right now. <br/>\n Thanks for helping!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5370365,"authorName":"Sue & Ron Patterson","from":"&quot;Sue & Ron Patterson&quot; &lt;Patterson5@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Writing at the Zoo Academy (wasRe:He is happening)","postDate":"1007448621","msgId":261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMjgwMWMxN2M4ZiRmMzFiM2E2MCQwNTAwMDAwNkBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PGQzLjJjNDQyYzguMjkzZGFiNDZAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDNDMEM1OUVBLjIwODAyMDBAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":264,"prevInTime":260,"nextInTime":262,"topicId":261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
