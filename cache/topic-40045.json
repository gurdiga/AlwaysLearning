In a classroom or alternative school, the  <br/>\n&quot;teachers&quot; (who still get paid to keep kids in a room or some known  <br/>\narea of containment) are facilitators--they help the kids make  <br/>\ndiscoveries and help them clarify their ideas and find more  <br/>\nresources.  In unschooling, the parent facilitates learning day and  <br/>\nnight for years without days off.  And when unschooling becomes well  <br/>\nintegrated into a family&#39;s life, there&#39;s not a difference between the  <br/>\nparenting actions and the facilitation actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Facilitate&quot; means to make something easier for someone else.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teaching\">http://sandradodd.com/teaching</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learning\">http://sandradodd.com/learning</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40044,"nextTopicId":40046}}
