I am hyper aware of my  inanimate <br/>\nsurroundings--the way a candle is placed on the table, a piece of fuzz  on the <br/>\nfloor, the way the waves look as we drive across the river.  My  husband, on the <br/>\nother hand notices what people are wearing and always remembers  their name.  <br/>\nHe&#39;ll say things like, &quot;Do you remember that women with the  pale blue shirt <br/>\nwith a stripe on the pocket standing by the pool?&quot;  I  struggle with names but <br/>\noften remember a story a person has told in  conversation.  He has few <br/>\nchildhood memories while I seem to remember the  past in often painful detail. <br/>\n <br/>\n.  My 15 year old daughter remembers what she ate after most  significant <br/>\nevents in her life.  She will say things like, &quot; I got  that scar on my toe when <br/>\nit got caught under the door when I was 3.  I ate  macaroni and cheese out of <br/>\nthat red plastic bowl that night.&quot; Always the event  is associated with food.  <br/>\nVery weird!<br/>\n <br/>\n  I find it all fascinating and sometimes  frustrating.  I often think I <br/>\ndon&#39;t remember names because I&#39;m  not comfortable meeting new people and just am <br/>\ntrying to be composed and not say  anything inane. He is very comfortable in <br/>\nsocial settings so he is able to  concentrate on their names and clothes.

I can&#39;t say wether or not thier is any evidence that smoking <br/>\npot effects your short term memory because I havne&#39;t researched it <br/>\nmyself.  What I do know is that when you smoke pot your brain <br/>\nreleases lots of seritonin (?).  What you see becomes amplified, what <br/>\nhear is amplified, what you taste is amplified.  You have major <br/>\nstimulation going on and the result is you start to block certain <br/>\nstuff out. It&#39;s like your brain can&#39;t take all the pleasure and <br/>\nintensity of everything.  When you sober up it takes a while for your <br/>\nbrain to stop doing this.  I don&#39;t hear names.  People will introduce <br/>\nthemselves to me and I can almost gaurantee I will not remember it.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s something I don&#39;t absorb into my brain.  When I was high, <br/>\nlooking at  green lushes trees blowing in the warm wind would amaze <br/>\nme.  The colors and sounds felt like they were running through me and <br/>\nI was apart of the *energy* the tree was giving.  Now when I look at <br/>\na tree I barely even notice it because I am sober and it isn&#39;t as <br/>\nintense as when I was high.  This leads me to not notice what I see, <br/>\nhear, taste and etc.  Maybe saying that I forget stuff is wrong.  <br/>\nMaybe what I should say is that I don&#39;t notice my environment like I <br/>\nshould or like I did before I had my 4 years of drug abuse.  It would <br/>\nbe like going from Breyers Ice cream to a popsicle.  Know what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been sober for 4 years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Earthmomma67@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/13/05 1:13:18 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unfortuantely I abused <br/>\n&gt; &gt; drugs for four years of my teen life and it has affected my short <br/>\n&gt; &gt; term memory. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure who even wrote the above (so it&#39;s not personal) but I <br/>\nwanted to <br/>\n&gt; make a comment about the above statement.
