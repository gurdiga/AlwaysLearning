It&#39;s from Hema Bharadwaj&#39;s blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thebharadwajknights.blogspot.com/2009/10/surprise-nana.html\">http://thebharadwajknights.blogspot.com/2009/10/surprise-nana.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHema and her husband Ravi (the &quot;Nana&quot; of the story) live in India.   <br/>\nThey have a three year old daughter named Zoya, and a son who&#39;s six,  <br/>\nand that&#39;s Raghu who did the charming thing about which she&#39;s  <br/>\nwritten.  &quot;DS&quot; isn&#39;t a son, here, it&#39;s a Gameboy.  The packing has to  <br/>\ndo with a trip they&#39;re taking to England, and then New Jersey to visit  <br/>\nrelatives, and then to New Mexico to see me!  That&#39;s the origin and  <br/>\npurpose of The Monkey Platter Festival.  They couldn&#39;t come during a  <br/>\nplanned conference anywhere, and would&#39;ve liked to have, so I&#39;m making  <br/>\na little local/regional conference-ish thing up in their honor.    <br/>\n(I&#39;ll put a link below, but here&#39;s the post.)<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the midst of a crazy evening... while caring for Zoya&#39;s ear- <br/>\ninfection, packing, making lists and getting the kids dinner.... I  <br/>\ndecided to make myself a chopped tomato, ground pepper and feta cheese  <br/>\nsalad and pour myself a glass of red wine. I needed to sit and chill.  <br/>\nSo i did.<br/>\n<br/>\nA while later when Z was napping (its night but she is in nap mode)  <br/>\nRavi came home from work looking tired. Raghu who until this point had  <br/>\nbeen playing his DS for several hours jumped up and said he was making  <br/>\na surprise for Nana (Ravi). So Ravi went and changed and came back  <br/>\ndown and closed his eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaghu, with no help from me, had chopped a tomato, ground some pepper  <br/>\nover the pieces and had crumbled feta into the mix. He then found the  <br/>\nwine and poured Ravi a glass. He asked me to re-cork it. Ravi was,  <br/>\nneedless to say, thrilled and enjoyed the snack. He wanted me to write  <br/>\nabout it on the blog. So here it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy rough evening became smooth and I could see beyond the chaos. And I  <br/>\nthink Ravi felt less tired instantly :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to having them as guests.  They&#39;ll get the room  <br/>\nKirby used to have, which Holly then had for a while.  I was going to  <br/>\ngive them two rooms, but Holly decided to come back for this too!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/festival\">http://sandradodd.com/festival</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48054,"nextTopicId":48078}}
