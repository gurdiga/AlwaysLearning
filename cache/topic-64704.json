I have two girls 9 and 11.  The 11 year old, Brooke,<br/>\nhas had much difficulty reading in school.  They left in March mostly<br/>\nbecause of Brooke&#39;s stress in an environment that pushed many things<br/>\nbefore she was ready.  The last couple years she kept saying, &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like to read.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t entirely true as I&#39;d<br/>\nseen her enthusiastically read (or attempt to) things that interested<br/>\nher.  It was the *required* reading that made her believe she didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey discovered an online game Wizard101 and have been playing intensely<br/>\nfor months.  In it you text other players in a virtual world.  You must<br/>\nspell correctly (mostly) or your text won&#39;t go through.  Many of<br/>\ntheir skills have skyrocketed from this game.  Typing, spelling,<br/>\nreading, managing virtual money, etc.  They&#39;re learning because they<br/>\nwant to and are having a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night Brooke found a book she&#39;d lost and plopped down next<br/>\nto me and started reading it to me.  I was surprised and delighted to<br/>\nhear her reading not only fluently, but with wonderful inflection.  She<br/>\nmissed words here and there but I never said so.  I was engrossed and<br/>\nshe had me laughing and it was so much fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet just a month ago she was skimming a game manual and I asked<br/>\nsomething about it and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, mom.  You know I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like to read.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t realize how untrue that<br/>\nactually is, and someday I may say so if she doesn&#39;t discover it<br/>\nherself.  But right now I&#39;m just thrilled with where she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261223738,"authorName":"Claire Darbaud","from":"Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt;","profile":"cdarbaud","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] iPods and learning to read","postDate":"1325598339","msgId":64705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRzB1Vzg9MDFrcnZwZEFHbT1UNHBZaE5oLVNwOWc3QjN3RVkzRmFpajJvX2lONnpQUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkdXJ2cytyZXU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkdXJ2cytyZXU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64704,"nextInTopic":64720,"prevInTime":64704,"nextInTime":64706,"topicId":64704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeh!!! :-) Happy new year to you too.
