I read about ADHD. I read about dyslexia and other learning \r<br/>\ndisabilities. I read about speech problems. I read about gifted \r<br/>\neducation. I read about bipolar children. I read about depression. I \r<br/>\nnever needed to diagnose my child, secretly or otherwise, to allow me to \r<br/>\nrecognize that I might (or might not) find some useful information in \r<br/>\nvarious places.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHow does labeling your child open the door to exploring information?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen you think of your child as him or herself, rather than as a \r<br/>\ndiagnosis or label, you can explore everything and glean ideas and try \r<br/>\nout what seems potentially useful with your real child and ignore the rest.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDiagnoses or labels can get in the way. Parents will nearly always \r<br/>\nfollow the standard procedures recommended by professionals for that \r<br/>\ndiagnosis. A good example of that is that kids with ADD are often \r<br/>\nassumed to need more structure and less stimulation. So they are put \r<br/>\ninto cubicles - blocked off from visual stimulation of seeing other kids \r<br/>\nor anything else. They are given one math problem at a time, instead of \r<br/>\na sheet full of them. Parents are told to make their rooms plain - \r<br/>\nremove potential distractions. That is standard procedure. How many \r<br/>\nparents of so-called ADD kids have been told they need a very rigid \r<br/>\nschedule? Here is an example of advice: &quot;Establish some kind of schedule \r<br/>\non weekends. Try not to deviate from the routines you establish. Begin \r<br/>\nwith small blocks of time, such as:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n8:30 Breakfast, 9:00 Chores in room; 10:30 Go to park, 12:00 lunch: 1:00 \r<br/>\nLibrary, 3:30 Free time, 5:00 Help with dinner preparation, 6:00 Dinner, \r<br/>\n7:00 Bath and free time, 8:30 Bedtime.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe article goes on and on about what ADD children need: predictability, \r<br/>\nconsistency, and scheduling.

For those that are there right now, considering it, maybe you can stop before you start.  Understanding child development is good.  Understanding child development within pedagogy, isn&#39;t nearly as helpful.  There are very few books out there, if any, that address these issues without also addressing school.  Know that all kids are different and some are so different from our own understanding that we, as parents, have a hard time relating or understanding.  It doesn&#39;t change the child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToo much worry and information and reading about child hood behavioral disorders can taint a parent&#39;s view of their child forever.  It seems better for unschooling, to see and recognize that your child likes physical contact and provide it.  It IS sensory input regardless of whether or not the child has sensory integration issues.  Patience and growth and change and finding ways for the senses to integrate needs a parent directly involved in being there and anticipating those needs because they know their child, NOT because they know their child&#39;s label.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Random bursts of hyperactivity","postDate":"1277574409","msgId":55290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4MDc0OS40MjU1MC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDkubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsY0EtTUJNQ1c1NkFvNXFjcVpKRk1BMUFoQzVwWlZHMFc5VnQtM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkwM2RtMytwaDZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODA1QkIwNkMtRkVGQy00RDUwLThFNUYtQUU2NkMyOTU5NjNDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWtFb193WmthY0NZVVVwRHNwVXRNY1p4Q3VFLTdrWGo0M0dIRXFfQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NEMyNUU0QTAuMjA1MDJAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWxjQS1NQk1DVzU2QW81cWNxWkpGTUExQWhDNXBaVkcwVzlWdC0zQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55289,"nextInTopic":55291,"prevInTime":55289,"nextInTime":55291,"topicId":55193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***What was the problem with being patient with him, meeting his needs creatively, not comparing him, or explaining his needs to extended family before the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1664528509\">***What was the problem with being patient with him, meeting his needs<br/>\ncreatively, not comparing him, or explaining his needs to extended family<br/>\nbefore the label?

Parents will nearly always <br/>\nfollow the standard procedures recommended by professionals for that <br/>\ndiagnosis. A good example of that is that kids with ADD are often <br/>\nassumed to need more structure and less stimulation. So they are put <br/>\ninto cubicles - blocked off from visual stimulation of seeing other kids <br/>\nor anything else. They are given one math problem at a time, instead of <br/>\na sheet full of them. Parents are told to make their rooms plain - <br/>\nremove potential distractions. That is standard procedure. How many <br/>\nparents of so-called ADD kids have been told they need a very rigid <br/>\nschedule? Here is an example of advice: &quot;Establish some kind of schedule <br/>\non weekends. Try not to deviate from the routines you establish.

She has undiagnosed Asperger&#39;s.  We have chosen not to label her, but instead we use the advice from several friends, websites and books.  This has helped us to understand that although her brain is wired differently, she can learn to cope in the normal world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, we do not get to decide what is normal; that has already been established by mainstream society.  But we can give her the tools to live in this world.  I know others will say that all kids are different and there are no such things as Asperger&#39;s, ADHD and Autism.  But I know from personal experience that some kids just aren&#39;t like their peers.  No matter how you try to help your kid: giving him an outlet for his energy, or extra protein; he may not be able to change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is &#39;wired differently&#39; these behaviors are normal for him and he may not even know that he is doing it.  Making a strange noise as a &#39;hello&#39; to his friend was perfectly ok with him.  He probably thought he was actually saying &#39;hello&#39;.  Telling you that he just can&#39;t stop bouncing may not mean that he needs more activities, just a place to bounce.  And touching the walls is a way to connect with the physical world in a loud, changing environment.  Maybe he needs to balance his head (mind) and his body by touching a solid object.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaising an autistic child is challenging; especially with 2 younger children who are so different from her!  My 5 yo nephew is also autistic, with some of the same symptoms as my daughter.  Although his are more severe and are more difficult to manage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot to say about the vast array of childhood behaviors.  Each child is different.  Personality is formed by genetics, upbringing, life experiences, etc.  We just go with the flow and give them a supportive, loving environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is perfect for my family (and my sister&#39;s family.)  We can just be there for our kids and facilitate their learning and growing.  But it is also a relief to know that there are actual, medical diagnoses out there when our emotions break down as we see our special kids suffer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are able to recognize her limitations and offer help in those awkward situations where she greets her friend nose-to-nose and squawks in her face.  (Pretending to be a chicken today?)  Don&#39;t be quick to apologize or make excuses.  Kids are weird sometimes.  Even without labels!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helps.  I know it can be frustrating to know that your child needs something and you don&#39;t know what it is, or how to give it to them.  Just be supportive and know that you aren&#39;t the only with a cross-wired kid!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Random bursts of hyperactivity","postDate":"1277386685","msgId":55239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCMEVEMENELTU5RDktNDEwQS04MUYzLUE0QzYyOEM5RjZCQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2cjNiMSszZTNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2cjNiMSszZTNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55231,"nextInTopic":55267,"prevInTime":55238,"nextInTime":55240,"topicId":55193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= Look really hard at the idea that they re random!

At some convenient stopping point in his game or show or play (very important!) offer to wrestle or play soccer or go climb something - whatever he tends to enjoy.
