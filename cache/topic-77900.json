I am not entirely sure that he wasn&#39;t reading some, but we read for him, he used audio books, etc and really got along quite well. When he was about 14, he just started reading--and his reading was at least &quot;on grade level&quot; or maybe a bit &quot;above&quot; grade level. Basically, I noticed that he was was reading the same stuff that his schooly friends were all reading so I guess that is what I mean by &quot;on grade level&quot;. And he would regularly read stuff that was from technical manuals for college level courses, which I am supposing is above the grade level that your average 14 year old would be. <div><br></div><div>Either way, we did occasionally talk about phonics through the years because I learned to read and spell using phonics and so I would share what I knew when the subject would come up as to why something was spelled the way it was spelled. I was just struck that most people probably don&#39;t talk about why things are spelled how they are or what languages words have come from. I guess we are a &quot;wordy&quot; crowd....  </div><div><br></div><div>Our home has always been full of books, we have always read out loud as a family or listened to audio books (the fully produced/acted ones are amazing) and we all use/used the written word on a daily basis. We never stressed about when anyone would learn to read or who was reading or wasn&#39;t... though my son did seem to feel that he was &quot;behind&quot; sometimes. I tried to reassure him that he would be reading one day and that everyone learns at a different pace. I would point out how many very complicated things he knew and could do already and that there were many kids his age that found those things difficult.  </div><div><br></div><div>Now that he is nearly 21, he still has some trouble spelling sometimes, but knows how to look things up or asks someone and is a happy reader who has no &quot;baggage&quot; around reading. He likes reading, he reads for pleasure, he reads for purpose... </div><div><br></div><div>This in contrast to my own process learning to read which I remember being painful and unpleasant and full of misery. The irony of this is that I am pretty certain that I wasn&#39;t a confident reader to somewhere around 14 when reading just made sense. My theory as to why this happened is that my brain just developed what it needed for reading to get easy. I think that the same thing happened with my son but he skipped the misery part.  Unschooling win!</div><div>chris</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_quote\">On Sat, Mar 11, 2017 at 6:00 AM, &#39;Rinelle&#39; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rinelle@...\">rinelle@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574m_1700012521109787989ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574m_1700012521109787989ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574m_1700012521109787989ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1781354574m_1700012521109787989WordSection1\"><p>One thing I noticed, when I wasn’t trying to make my child do things on a school timetable, was how much easier a skill was to learn when she was ready.

I am mildly dyslexic (an imperfect term, to be sure, but it makes my point) and so I would inevitably reverse a few letters in a couple of words every test. I was apparently labeled as &quot;smart&quot; so several of my teachers would always explain this &quot;failure&quot; as me being &quot;lazy&quot; because I obviously did not work &quot;hard enough&quot; or I would have gotten a &quot;better&quot; grade.  </div><div><br></div><div>For whatever reason (I have been described as &quot;naturally contrary&quot; by relatives) I never really cared about what grades I got. My parents generally would ask more about what I did and how I liked things at school, not what grades I had received and so I didn&#39;t get a lot of pressure about grades. I think my parents may have worried or been upset if I got &quot;bad&quot; grades, but since a &quot;B&quot; isn&#39;t really bad, they didn&#39;t stress. I remember thinking that it was weird that my teachers seemed to be more worried about what grades I received than me or my parents.  As an adult, I realize that they had statistics to worry about and would have to answer questions about why a child who tested well was not getting good grades. I always did very well on standardized tests. </div><div><br></div><div>I truly believe that test taking is a talent that I was born with. I read about how to do well on tests like this (or it was read to me? I was very young and did not read &quot;early&quot;) and always did well on standardized tests. I have taught people how to do well on these tests. A coworker of mine had never taken a standardized test until she had to sit for her social work licensure exam. She did very poorly the first time she took the test. After I tutored her on testing skills, and she took a couple of practice exams, she more than doubled her performance and passed with a very good score. </div><div><br></div><div>I have met people who help to construct tests like the ones that they give children in schools and they honestly believe that the tests that they give these kids actually measure something other than the ability to take a certain kind of test. </div><div>Chris</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1930873450gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1930873450gmail_quote\">On Sat, Mar 11, 2017 at 12:36 AM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

I was not one of those people who saw a step once and then could perform it nearly perfectly the first time. My youngest child was like that, I had friends like that, but me, I had to see the step broken down piece by piece. I had to learn it by doing each tiny part of the step a bit at a time and then the next part and then the next...&nbsp; Then I would know what the step was supposed to be and I would have to practice it slowly, slowly day after day until I could get up to full speed. I had one other friend who had to learn the steps like this. We would practice together. We had a teacher that never criticized, she would only give gentle correction and would tell us to keep trying and then we would get there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And we always did &quot;get there&quot;, and we had fun on the way. We both would be so proud when we would master each step. And with each step, our confidence in our bodies grew and our ability to learn new steps grew. In the end, my friend and I became very passable dancers who really loved dancing. No, neither of us would ever be dancing professionally, but I managed to do well enough to be a number of musicals and danced in each of them, keeping up with the folks who could dance circles around most of us. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, playing piano is another thing that I did not take to naturally. I took lessons, I practiced. I actually enjoyed scales! But I found that I was not having fun practicing, I wasn&#39;t feeling like I truly conquered something with each step of progress and after about a year, I stopped taking lessons.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I never regretted the time that I spent trying to master dance or piano. Though I really only managed to &quot;master&quot; one of them. I suppose you could use the term &quot;struggle&quot; for my attempts at learning dance and piano. But I only found one of those activities rewarding enough to keep struggling. Dance was sometimes frustrating, but I loved it so much that it was worth the frustration and the effort. Piano was frustrating too, but I didn&#39;t love it and so I didn&#39;t keep trying. The reward of playing a piece of music just wasn&#39;t enough, like mastering a step in dance was.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, maybe what your teacher friend is noticing is that kids are just not convinced that the reward is worth the work.&nbsp;</div><div>Chris</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174gmail_extra\"><br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174gmail_quote\">On Fri, Mar 10, 2017 at 10:43 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amberuby@...\">amberuby@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px #ccc solid;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-559820174m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><p>I used to be a teacher and have a friend that I did my training with who is still teaching.

I’ve already written a response based on my initial thoughts:</p><blockquote style=\"padding:0px;\"><p>You state &quot;they have to actually struggle sometimes to progress.&quot; That is sometimes true. Maybe. I&#39;m trying to think of times this might have been true for me. I recall walking away from an abstract algebra problem, because I couldn&#39;t figure out the answer. I went and took a shower, though, and the answer suddenly came out of nowhere! So the funny thing is - I had to go relax and stop thinking, stop struggling, and then I progressed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Now, socially, I struggle a lot. I&#39;m not entirely sure if I&#39;m making progress, but I do keep trying. What you call &quot;struggle for progress&quot; is maybe the concept of practice? But I&#39;m not sure if &quot;struggle&quot; is the best word for that process. The word &quot;struggle&quot; makes me think of this page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/battle\">http://sandradodd.com/battle</a></p><p>.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#39;t know, but I think this comes back to the concept of intrinsic interest. Depending on how attached I am to achieving the end goal, I will either decide to keep trying, or not. When I started training for a half-marathon, I thought I was going to jog.

I was not one of those people who saw a step once and then could perform it nearly perfectly the first time. My youngest child was like that, I had friends like that, but me, I had to see the step broken down piece by piece. I had to learn it by doing each tiny part of the step a bit at a time and then the next part and then the next...  Then I would know what the step was supposed to be and I would have to practice it slowly, slowly day after day until I could get up to full speed. I had one other friend who had to learn the steps like this. We would practice together. We had a teacher that never criticized, she would only give gentle correction and would tell us to keep trying and then we would get there. </div><div><br></div><div>And we always did &quot;get there&quot;, and we had fun on the way. We both would be so proud when we would master each step. And with each step, our confidence in our bodies grew and our ability to learn new steps grew. In the end, my friend and I became very passable dancers who really loved dancing. No, neither of us would ever be dancing professionally, but I managed to do well enough to be a number of musicals and danced in each of them, keeping up with the folks who could dance circles around most of us.  </div><div><br></div><div>Now, playing piano is another thing that I did not take to naturally. I took lessons, I practiced. I actually enjoyed scales! But I found that I was not having fun practicing, I wasn&#39;t feeling like I truly conquered something with each step of progress and after about a year, I stopped taking lessons. </div><div><br></div><div>I never regretted the time that I spent trying to master dance or piano. Though I really only managed to &quot;master&quot; one of them. I suppose you could use the term &quot;struggle&quot; for my attempts at learning dance and piano. But I only found one of those activities rewarding enough to keep struggling. Dance was sometimes frustrating, but I loved it so much that it was worth the frustration and the effort. Piano was frustrating too, but I didn&#39;t love it and so I didn&#39;t keep trying. The reward of playing a piece of music just wasn&#39;t enough, like mastering a step in dance was. </div><div><br></div><div>So, maybe what your teacher friend is noticing is that kids are just not convinced that the reward is worth the work. </div><div>Chris</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704gmail_quote\">On Fri, Mar 10, 2017 at 10:43 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amberuby@...\">amberuby@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-345720704m_-3349700774773298930ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><p>I used to be a teacher and have a friend that I did my training with who is still teaching.

Now, after years and years of more and more work that feels less and less relevant, they’re understandably balking. They’re asking, “What’s the point?” and not being satisfied with an answer that was never satisfying to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo invest time and effort into something, you need to believe the time and effort will pay off. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat insular belief that schools provide what kids need, makes it easy to justify blaming the kids when the system doesn’t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s like the person who asks, “Why is everyone so mean to me?” Is it everyone? Or might the root of the problem be in the common factor:  you?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are still kids. The thing that’s changed is school. And the expectations of parents that all kids will be going to college, whether they have any idea what they want to do in life or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who has spent time with kids playing video games *knows* that kids know that sometimes a lot of effort needs to go into reaching a goal. Sometimes the effort isn’t pleasant. But kids weigh the worth of the goal versus what it takes to reach it. If the goal doesn’t feel worth the effort, they’ll go find something that is worth their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool feels like it’s wasting their time. If teachers keep dismissing that feedback as just kids being lazy, it’s only going to get worse for teachers and kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] a necessary struggle?","postDate":"1489161657","msgId":77901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3RTZDWHRNczAzcF9EazRZbXJqTnJHSF9oa1JGcmZqSllqdm1jZTQ1cnV2UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG85dWhqZCszNTJiN0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG85dWhqZCszNTJiN0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77900,"nextInTopic":77902,"prevInTime":77900,"nextInTime":77902,"topicId":77900,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think struggling is a waste of resources.

It is like spinning your tires in the mud. You burn gas and go nowhere.

Sometimes they get frustrated and appear to be struggling, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening, I don&#39;t think. What&#39;s happening is that they KNOW they can do it, and the pace of their progress on the task they are choosing is not keeping up with their vision of where they will be when they master it. That disconnect is frustrating. They are not spinning wheels pointlessly; they are aware that they are getting there, just more slowly than feels happy right in that moment.<br><br></div>As a mom, I find that it is very difficult for me if I think my kids are struggling. I want to intercede; to help them get past that feeling. When they are working, and frustrated, I have found that the challenge for me is to support them rather than try to get them to stop so that *I* don&#39;t have to feel uncomfortable with their process.
