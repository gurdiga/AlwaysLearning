I <br/>\nnoticed I&#39;m the 17th member to subscribe to this group.  That <br/>\nhappens to be my second luckiest number!!  My luckiest number <br/>\nis #2.  I was born on 2/2/59.  My sister was born on the same day <br/>\nexactly one year later.  I have fraternal twin boys.  After the twins <br/>\nwere born, it was obvious my new favorite number should be #2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI originally joined the Unschooling.com list about 1 1/2 weeks <br/>\nago.  Apparantly there was some kind of argument going on <br/>\nwhich I didn&#39;t understand, participate in, or really wanted to find <br/>\nout the details about.  Today, I found out about this new list <br/>\nSandra Dodd created.  So, here I am.  It&#39;s exciting for me to come <br/>\nin on the ground floor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to continue subscribing to the other list.  I&#39;m sure that <br/>\nshould be OK.  If not, let me know and I&#39;ll drop the other list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned about Unschooling in 1994, after reading John Holt&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.  I consider it the most important book I <br/>\nhave ever read.  It truly changed my life.  My boys are 7 years old <br/>\nand are unschooled.  We enjoy life and learning in a very relaxed <br/>\nand natural way every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to learning more about unschooling from you, <br/>\nSandra.  I have read many good things about you.  I wish this <br/>\nnew list much success.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4,"nextTopicId":17}}
