It took me weeks to write out the lines for the characters, assign roles to about 8 different friends (including myself). I had music cued up for certain parts. I also made cool props, all by myself with free time I had after school and on weekends. It was really exciting. We rehearsed a few times too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just remember it being one of the most ecxiting, important things that I had ever done by myself as a child. IIt was a Christmas play and I had plans to perform it at a local nursing home. I loved every minute of the process and I put so much time and energy into the whole thing <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I did something &quot;wrong&quot; one day, (I don&#39;t remember what now), and my parents punished me by not allowing me to perform the play I wrote/created. I had to call everyone in the play and the nursing home to cancel. It was so unfair and mean and my body still gets hot thinking about it. I cried and cried. How could they not have seen or cared about how much I put into it all? I guess they thought it would be a punishment that would &quot;stick&quot; because it was something that meant so much to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why the above story from Katherine made me remember this time from my childhood, but something about it did. I guess because my parents never valued the importance or significance of things that brought joy and meaning to my life, just like the father in Katherine&#39;s story. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Dayna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:  Unschooling at last","postDate":"1162689833","msgId":27271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWM3MDA3OSQwZWExNDAwMCRmYzY4OTA0NUBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":27268,"nextInTopic":27272,"prevInTime":27270,"nextInTime":27272,"topicId":27240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***The Deltona Murders was over an Xbox, and the deaths contributed to a style of killing from one of the games.*** Oh, I love this game!

If I say &quot;ok, enough TV for today&quot; and suggest that we do  <br/>\nsomething, he is usually glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of  <br/>\nsomething he really wants to watch I just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over  <br/>\ndo you think we could go do something?&quot; and he always is fine with  <br/>\nthat. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but I think there are  <br/>\nsome kids that are more addictive and affected by it than others. I  <br/>\njust disagree with total self regulation on that topic....sorry. I do  <br/>\nbelieve it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self- <br/>\nregulation works for all of you.

That &#39;s how I&#39;m feeling about unschooling. <br/>\n    I am questioning so many of the old beliefs I carry that block joy. <br/>\n    I  feel  overwhelmed with grief when I think of the ten years I have been <br/>\nparenting my son from a place of judgement. I think that is a normal reaction <br/>\nbecause it is a lose. I feel inspired to parent from a place of unconditional love <br/>\nand acceptance (which I actually thought I was doing before). I could cry <br/>\nabout the 10 years wasted or say &quot;Thank God he&#39;s just turning 10&quot; ! There is <br/>\nstill time! <br/>\n    I feel grateful to all of you who contribute and share and especially Sandra <br/>\nDodd who&#39;s writings have changed my life.<br/>\n     My last thread of fear is attached to video games and television.(At least it&#39;s <br/>\nonly a thread. A month ago it was a steel cable). I&#39;ve let go of  total control but <br/>\nstill loosely limit time. I let him buy a hunting game that he&#39;s been wanting <br/>\nwhere you kill animals. I tried watching while he played because he wanted <br/>\nme to and it was more than I could handle. I felt so disturbed by it. I bowed out <br/>\nas unjudmentally as I could but didn&#39;t tell him that he couldn&#39;t play. It was a big <br/>\nstep for me. I don&#39;t understand it though, why he would enjoy a game like that. <br/>\nI&#39;m really hung up on this video thing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27288,"nextTopicId":27292}}
