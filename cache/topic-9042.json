I just love to Google anyway, so I found this below.<br/>\nI&#39;d never thought about public school and its students, teachers, graduates<br/>\nand supporters in this way before:<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010802090349/www.pt7.com/public/articles/stockh\">http://web.archive.org/web/20010802090349/www.pt7.com/public/articles/stockh</a><br/>\nolm.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nEmotional Bond <br/>\nThe Stockholm Syndrome is an emotional attachment, a bond of interdependence<br/>\nbetween captive and captor that develops &#39;when someone threatens your life,<br/>\ndeliberates, and doesn&#39;t kill you.&#39; (Symonds, 1980) The relief resulting<br/>\nfrom the removal of the threat of death generates intense feelings of<br/>\ngratitude and fear that combine to make the captive reluctant to display<br/>\nnegative feelings toward the captor or terrorist. In fact, former hostages<br/>\nhave visited their captors in jail, recommended defense counsel, and even<br/>\nstarted a defense fund. It is this dynamic, which causes former hostages and<br/>\nabuse survivors to minimize the damage done to them and refuse to cooperate<br/>\nin prosecuting their tormentors. &quot;The victims&#39; need to survive is stronger<br/>\nthan his/her impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma.&quot;<br/>\n(Strentz, 1980) The victim comes to see the captor as a &#39;good guy&#39;, even a<br/>\nsavior. This condition...occurs in response to the four specific conditions<br/>\nlisted below:<br/>\n<br/>\n*    A person threatens to kill another and is perceived as having the<br/>\ncapability to do so.<br/>\n*    The other cannot escape, so her or his life depends on the threatening<br/>\nperson.<br/>\n*    The threatened person is isolated from outsiders so that the only other<br/>\nperspective available to her or him is that of the threatening person.<br/>\n*    The threatening person is perceived as showing some degree of kindness<br/>\nto the one being threatened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes only 3-4 days for the characteristic bond of the Stockholm syndrome<br/>\nto emerge when captor and captive are strangers. After that, research shows,<br/>\nthe duration of captivity is no longer relevant.<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize children are not actually threatened with *death* in kindergarten,<br/>\nbut consider the trauma of separation from the parent; those photos of<br/>\nchildren clinging to mommy as they are taken, crying, aboard a bus that<br/>\nfirst day of school are a regular feature of September newspapers, and<br/>\nsomething our society takes for granted as *normal,* a part of growing up.<br/>\nKids get used to it, right?  (They can&#39;t escape.)  After a month or two,<br/>\n(with compliance from their parents, who continue the school&#39;s program by<br/>\nenforcing homework and sending them back every day) they love school, don&#39;t<br/>\nthey?  The teacher gives out stickers and candy and grades (sometimes good<br/>\nones which please the parents) and is kind (unless a child misbehaves; it<br/>\nonly takes one or two &quot;examples&quot; to bring the rest under control).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe duration of captivity seems to continue into adulthood for some people.<br/>\nI wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject school?<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dress for Success or PUBLIC HUMILIATION?","postDate":"1030852034","msgId":9048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTAxMDM0NzE0LjQzODg5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwODMxLjE2Mjc0NC4tMTIxMTgxLjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9047,"nextInTopic":9057,"prevInTime":9047,"nextInTime":9049,"topicId":9042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If everyone got together on the same day and wore the No-No stuff, then everyone could have the tee shirt.
