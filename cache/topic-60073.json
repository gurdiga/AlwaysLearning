Things get misplaced, people get distracted on their way to get something, miscommunication happens, and it is just because there are humans involved. Pleasantly follow up on everything. Don&#39;t take things personally, and don&#39;t try to be nice by waiting or watching silently if something seems off. It seems like you are highly involved. Just remember that stress is unhealthy and impedes healing, so keeping your advocacy as nonconfrontational as possible will help your son. I wish I had learned this before stressing out a lot of sick people. I know it&#39;s so easy to go all Mama Bear about your family, but you&#39;ll probably get checked on more often if you can stay pleasant enough that people don&#39;t dread visiting your room. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex N.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":420800158,"authorName":"Renee Boisvert","from":"Renee Boisvert &lt;learnavecjoie@...&gt;","profile":"wrenaeb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Balance under duress","postDate":"1298845694","msgId":60091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMj1ienZvN29ac2dreGNIR249QnI4ZDYxVXptelE4K0d1dnZhSkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrY3JjMSttZGxqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlrY3JjMSttZGxqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60090,"nextInTopic":60174,"prevInTime":60090,"nextInTime":60092,"topicId":60073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am a certified child life specialist.

Emergency medical situations and urgent care needs do<br/>\nchallenge unschooling beliefs. This is an important discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may ask if there is a child life specialist available. He or she can<br/>\nhelp you to advocate, do medical play with your child, teach coping and<br/>\nrelaxation strategies to you and your child, and prepare your child for<br/>\ninvasive procedures. Even after a traumatic experience CL interventions can<br/>\nhelp to process the experience and make future medical experiences less<br/>\ndaunting. You are the expert on your child, and a CLS will typically ask you<br/>\nand your child lots of questions to help fit any plans to your child and<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the hospital does not have a child life department, you might find a CLS<br/>\nin private practice, or you could call the nearest children&#39;s hospital and<br/>\nask for a child life consult if there are issues left-over for your child<br/>\nonce you are home. (distress during eyedrops, anxiety about follow-up<br/>\nvisits...)<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, when I was working in the field, we would recommend that<br/>\nparents (and CLSs) decline to be the ones to restrain a child for a<br/>\nprocedure, and that they keep their role to providing comfort and calm for<br/>\nthe child. Now, there are guidelines for &quot;positions of comfort&quot; which<br/>\ninclude ways for parents (or others) to hold a child for optimum comfort,<br/>\nwhile gently restraining at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are 2 links which explain and give examples of comfort positioning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stjude.org/SJFile/child_life_comfort_positions.pdf\">http://www.stjude.org/SJFile/child_life_comfort_positions.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chkd.org/Services/ChildLife/ComfortPositions.aspx\">http://www.chkd.org/Services/ChildLife/ComfortPositions.aspx</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that your son recovers quickly and completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Feb 26, 2011 at 10:35 PM, nycartgal2003 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mranzer@...\">mranzer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We just spent the day in the ER, and we are now waiting for a bed so they<br/>\n&gt; can admit my 4 year old son to the hospital.

We spent plenty if hospital time over the next few years. My son also has autism (asperger&#39;s syndrome). Holding him down was part of what was necessary even though it hurt me emotionally to do so. It was medically necessary. The doctors and nurses want to give good care and want our kids to heal, but the pressure and stress from their jobs might make it seem like they are cold or uncaring. Be loving and stay calm no matter what, for your son. Seeing mom stay calm is very reassuring. Comfort afterward is also key. I have had to be my son&#39;s advocate in that I have to remind doctors of the autism diagnosis, but they are always understanding.

Depending on your child, that may be fine with him or make him feel helpless and/or angry and left out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also sometimes seem physically unaware of a young patient&#39;s presence. When my daughter (2 1/2 at the time) was injured and being prepped for surgery, the surgeon came out to talk to me, he leaned on the bed rail right over her face and proceeded to gesture with his hands. She flinched. I had to point it out to him. It was as if he wasn&#39;t even aware she was in the bed. We had similar experiences with nurses and ER docs and x-ray techs. They would talk over her or with their backs to her or other things they would (should) never do to an adult patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if you are in a hospital where they want to bring a bunch of residents in for teaching purposes, it&#39;s your right to say NO!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd take care of yourself, too. That is the biggest mistake I made during the 6 weeks of stressful bandage changes, etc. I didn&#39;t reach out and ask friends to make meals, etc. or get out and go for walks.
