For example, cars are not too convivial &#39;cause their<br/>\nuse changes the landscape, so it becomes less people-friendly, and changes<br/>\nthe concept of accessible distance, so people &quot;lose the use of their own<br/>\ntwo feet&quot;, etc. <br/>\n****************<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Why does &quot;entrenchment&quot; make a tool (whatever your definition of &quot;tool&quot; is) <br/>\n&gt; better?<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\nI think Illich and other writers use entrenched to mean &quot;one that has been<br/>\nused for a long time&quot;, and it&#39;s better for a communication tool because<br/>\nmore people know how to use it, for example, so the rules about using it <br/>\nare clearer, etc.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; [about TV]<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;It is one-to-many communication and, while cheap<br/>\n&gt; and easy to use as a viewer, is extremely expensive and technically<br/>\n&gt; challenging to be a broadcaster.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t change the value of Zoom to kids who like Zoom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n***********<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Zoom is not TV, right?

It&#39;s as though I invited anyone who wanted to come to <br/>\na party, but that doesn&#39;t mean newcomers to the party have the right to <br/>\ninsult all the guests and tear down the house.  It&#39;s ALWAYS polite, when <br/>\ncoming into any situation of any sort, to stand on the edge and observe, to <br/>\nget the tone and rhythm of what&#39;s going on, to see what IS before you jump in <br/>\nthe middle with what ought to be.  (Unless you&#39;re a policeman sent to break <br/>\nthe party up, and this party had no need of being broken up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you approach a sporting event, stand and watch a while before even asking <br/>\nthe other spectators what&#39;s going on.  Don&#39;t jump out on the field and grab <br/>\nthe ball.  You won&#39;t get a good reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we discuss your question about whether all tools are made equal, it <br/>\nwould help for you to define &quot;tool,&quot; and if it doesn&#39;t match the normal <br/>\ndefinition of tool, it will be pretty hard to discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5441600,"authorName":"Ariadna Solovyova","from":"Ariadna Solovyova &lt;ari@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Are all tools made equal?

And I&#39;ll do<br/>\nmy best to be gentle and humble. I usually am, really :-) . Oh yes, AND<br/>\nlogical. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I did learn a lot from the previous discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important things: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. I *must* introduce myself before posting, so people will know where I&#39;m<br/>\ncoming from. I&#39;m a programmer/linguist/musician, have read all of Holt<br/>\n(many times over), almost all of Ivan Illich, and every book on<br/>\nunschooling I could find. I like radical unschooling (and &#39;most anything<br/>\nradical ;-) ) My daughter is 4. I&#39;m from Russia, English is my second<br/>\nlanguage, so I really didn&#39;t know &quot;that honoring feelings business&quot; was<br/>\nderogatory. I thought it simply meant &quot;what they say about honoring<br/>\nfeelings&quot;. I have to &quot;watch my phrasology&quot; (from &quot;The Music Man&quot;, too :-)<br/>\n), but first I have to use it and be corrected. (I love it when people<br/>\ncorrect my language; Americans are usually too polite to do it in a<br/>\nface-to-face conversation.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I must state my goals before posting. Here they are: to ask many<br/>\nquestions and to listen to answers. I don&#39;t like arguing at all, so I when<br/>\nI ask a question, I really just want to ask a question, not to challenge.<br/>\nWhen I make a statement, I don&#39;t try to convince. If your view is<br/>\ndifferent, I&#39;ll read it with great interest, but won&#39;t try to defend mine.<br/>\nDefending my opinions in this particular situation is not important to me.<br/>\nI&#39;ll defend just a few statements, but it&#39;s a lot more interesting to me<br/>\nto bring up related issues and get deeper into the subject. I feel I&#39;ll<br/>\nlearn more that way at this time. That&#39;s a good strategy for children and<br/>\ninexperienced people -- to ask lots of questions and listen. I wish I<br/>\nalways were wise enough to do what I think is best :-) .<br/>\n<br/>\nA wise child asks one thousand questions,<br/>\nAn unwise, only one hundred and three <br/>\n(from some Persian poet...;-)... that &quot;Music Man&quot; sure is sticky)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t like to talk to people with these conversational goals,<br/>\nit&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t talk to me. If you think people shouldn&#39;t post on<br/>\nthis list if they have goals like that, please explain why. <br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\nOkay on to the discussion:<br/>\nThe thing is, this discussion is extremely important to me. Because I have<br/>\nalways thought that state-owned schooling and big corporation owned TV are<br/>\nBOTH things to be avoided. And I&#39;m really interested in this connection<br/>\nbetween school and TV as institutional tools. That&#39;s just one reason I&#39;m<br/>\nposting here, and not on some anti-tv list. If you want to know the other<br/>\nreasons, please ask! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are LOTSA issues here, and it would be nice to keep them separate:<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is there a difference between watching TV and videos or home movies?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer: Yes. It&#39;s easy to make a movie (some kind of movie) and hard to<br/>\nbecome a TV broadcaster (see about convivial tools below). It easy to find<br/>\na good movie (go to imdb.org and read reviews), it&#39;s harder to find a good<br/>\nTV show (if they have any lasting value, they&#39;ll be available on videotape<br/>\nat the library). I can list more if anyone wants to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your answer?<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is it okay to not have a TV and use the library to check out some TV<br/>\nshows on videotapes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer: Yes. That&#39;s what libraries are for. We pay taxes, overdue fines<br/>\nand donate, and then we get to use books, magazines, videos, etc. without<br/>\nhaving to buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your answer?<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is TV a tool no better or worse than other tools? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:  I don&#39;t think all tools are equally valuable. I kinda feel it<br/>\nintuitively, but I started thinking about it with more clarity after<br/>\nreading &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; by Ivan Illich (author of &quot;Deschooling<br/>\nSociety&quot; and a major influence on John Holt). Basically more convivial<br/>\ntools have more of these features: <br/>\n\t* one-to-one communication <br/>\n        * low cost <br/>\n\t* easy to use <br/>\n\t* widely available <br/>\n\t* entrenched <br/>\n        * surveillance-resistant <br/>\n\t* censorship-resistant <br/>\n\t* disruption-resistant<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, &quot;The Net is only the latest in convivial communication media. Most of<br/>\nthese features are found in face-to-face conversations, the postal system<br/>\nand the telephone system. In contrast, broadcast television is one of the<br/>\nleast convivial media. It is one-to-many communication and, while cheap<br/>\nand easy to use as a viewer, is extremely expensive and technically<br/>\nchallenging to be a broadcaster. &quot;<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://english.uq.edu.au/mc/reviews/features/politics/convivial-c.html)\">http://english.uq.edu.au/mc/reviews/features/politics/convivial-c.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t have Illich&#39;s book handy, but the above is in his spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you say? Does ANYONE think tools are not all equal? If you do,<br/>\nplease post!<br/>\n<br/>\n****Whether or not TV is a good tool, do you think that tool is used well<br/>\nmost of the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer: <br/>\nNo. I think most shows are produced by big corporations and serve their<br/>\ninterests in one way or another. I think I&#39;ll list the ways they serve<br/>\nthose interests later. That is, if anyone cares to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n****Whether or not all of the above is true, do you think TV is more<br/>\naddictive than other communication media?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer: No. Writing letters to email lists is much more addictive... oh<br/>\ngod I really should go to bed....<br/>\n<br/>\n****___IF___ someone believes at least one of the above is true, do you<br/>\nthink it&#39;s logical for them to ditch the TV?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:<br/>\nYes, in most cases.<br/>\nI&#39;ll elaborate later.<br/>\n****Are children who grew up without the TV more or less likely to get<br/>\naddicted in adulthood?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:<br/>\nVery hard to tell. Could be a factor, but there are lots of other<br/>\nfactors at play.<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is a child likely to share your convictions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:<br/>\nYes, those that you&#39;re most passionate about. From my own and my friends&#39;<br/>\nexperience. Not guaranteed, but very likely. But does depend on<br/>\npersonality, the way you talk about your convictions etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n****If a child has developed a conviction opposing yours, should you help<br/>\nhim to further his attachment to it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:<br/>\nIt&#39;s natural and good to first try (once again ;-) ) to explain your<br/>\nconviction. Then it&#39;s natural and good (if you think your conviction is<br/>\ntrue -- but why else would you hold it?) to just point out resources from<br/>\nwhich he might learn more, and let him learn by experience, and not help<br/>\nhim actively.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nand many many more issues I&#39;ll try to single out later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, am I sleepy...
