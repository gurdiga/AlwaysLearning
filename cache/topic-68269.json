Her older son in my mind as always been perfectly suited for unschooling or at least homeschooling, as I doubt for their family unschooling has ever been a real option. He&#39;s always been just a little out of the box and interested in all kinds of things sourdough bread, pearls, ukelele, surfing, film making come to mind immediately. I&#39;ve always had a good relationship with my sister, and have always said, oh, just pull him out of school and let him follow these interests fully. <br/>\nShe&#39;s always been on the fence. Interested. watching what I do, but unwilling to really go over the edge. The other day she told me that she loved John Taylor Gatto, but no one she spoke to had ever heard of him...<br/>\nAnyhow, I just give you that as a background. <br/>\nThey have moved to Sydney Australia (just last week), put the boys in school immediately (no summer vacation) , and the older one is miserable. Does anyone know any homeschool or unschool support in Australia? Like perhaps a Sudbury school? or a park day or a teen group? a way for teens to meet other teens that doesn&#39;t include regular school? I think if I knew of some resources there, pulling him out of school may be an option for them.
