I was at one time a single<br/>\nparent working upwards of 80 hours per week as a<br/>\npediatric resident, and I unschooled. The main issue<br/>\nto overcome for me was how to keep my kid out of an<br/>\ninstitution while I worked. I did this by lucking out<br/>\nreally and finding a wonderful live-in nanny who cared<br/>\nfor my son while I worked. She did everything from tag<br/>\nalong with him to the library, get him to bed and up<br/>\nwhen necessary, supervised playdates, pretty much<br/>\neverything I wasn&#39;t there to do. I have always been<br/>\nflexible with sleep, etc, so having my kid stay up<br/>\nlate and sleep in was no big deal, which enhanced the<br/>\namount of time we spent together. It wasn&#39;t easy, and<br/>\nhonestly wasn&#39;t even my ideal, but it worked out for<br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d had my wish, I would have had a supportive<br/>\npartner at the time or extended family to help out.<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t the case then, so I had to get creative<br/>\nand stay flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m the working mom and my partner is the stay at<br/>\nhome mom. We both really want one of us to always be<br/>\nwith our kids, and we share educaional philosphy, so<br/>\nthis makes life pretty ideal for us in this regard. I<br/>\ndo feel like I miss out on quite a bit while I&#39;m at<br/>\nwork, even though I limit my hours; but I absolutely<br/>\nlove my  work. It&#39;s more of a mission for me. Heck<br/>\neven some of our vacations are spent in places where I<br/>\ndo my job on a volunteer basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what is best philosphically speaking...I can<br/>\nsay that it would certainly be ideal if a family <br/>\ncould survive in this age as a family unit without one<br/>\nor both parents having to separate themselves from the<br/>\nfamily to work. Heck, even most of the family farmers<br/>\nback where I grew up have to work off the farm to<br/>\nsurvive! It&#39;s just sad that so many folks don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe choice. For many people working or staying home is<br/>\nnot a choice they get to make. That&#39;s a socio-economic<br/>\nclass issue, and a political one. For those of us with<br/>\nthe opportunity to choose, we may in fact be faced<br/>\nwith a larger dilemma because it *is* a choice. Is one<br/>\n&#39;right or wrong&#39; to choose to spend time doing work or<br/>\na hobby which fulfills one&#39;s interests outside of<br/>\nparenting or family life? I think that&#39;s a question<br/>\nthat each individual has to answer for him- or<br/>\nherself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat questions,<br/>\nKim<br/>\n--- DaBreeze21 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susanmay15@...\">susanmay15@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Second, I have been thinking about how unschooling<br/>\n&gt; works with the <br/>\n&gt; whole idea of working Mothers.

After not stepping foot in a church of any kind in years he decided to start having the missionaries come over. It started out as &quot; Im curious about the mormon church and think i want to learn more about it &quot; and has turned into I think maybe i like these mormon people. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So tomorrow we are going to visit their church. My oldest is 8 so they cannot stay home by themselves. I talked with them a bit about going tomorrow and what it might be like. Im bringing my little laptop with ear phones. My 8 year old can choose to sit outside and play on the laptop or come in the sacrament meeting with us.most likely a little of both. My 4 year old wants to bring her bear and color and coloring books and Im packing a few quiet toy for my son and a few snacks. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I expect at least one to get antsy and want to go out . Well go walking, maybe out to the van and eat a snack. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It can be frustrating to not get to hear most of the service but i think thats part of having kids. Mom and dad can trade off taking kids out. A wednesday service or religious study may be a possibility . There are also chat rooms, forums, etc on the net for religious discussion. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
