Recently someone asked me some questions.  This is a very <br/>\n&gt; private list, we&#39;ve been together for almost 8 years and all of our kids <br/>\n&gt; are exactly the same age.  Someone brought up a friend they know who <br/>\n&gt; homeschools for religious reasons and isolates her child and doesn&#39;t let <br/>\n&gt; her child be with other kids or read books, etc.  She thinks that <br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers should be monitored, parents should be tested to see if <br/>\n&gt; they are qualified, kids should be tested, homestudies done, etc.  AHHH. <br/>\n&gt;   She said this<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A child who is going to school outside of the home is being assessed<br/>\n&gt; regularly by outsiders -- school teachers, school nurse, librarian etc,<br/>\n&gt; so that is already being done.

I think this is still <br/>\na valid concern for a very small percentage of homeschoolers. School <br/>\ncan be the best situation for some children and I&#39;ve seen up front <br/>\nand personal some of those situations in real life. But, to put it <br/>\nin perspective, this isn&#39;t just true for homeschoolers but for all <br/>\nsegments of the population. It isn&#39;t an education problem at all, it <br/>\nis a parenting problem. I&#39;ve talked to grown up children who were <br/>\nabused at home and went to school and the abuse still went on and no <br/>\none &quot;saved&quot; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why should homeschoolers feel that this is an infringement of their<br/>\n&gt; rights.

It seems <br/>\nas if the person asking this question isn&#39;t just asking if a child <br/>\nis well cared for but also if they are &quot;up to educational <br/>\nstandards&quot;. That is a whole &#39;nother kettle of fish when talking to <br/>\nschoolers: some don&#39;t know what goes on with testing and you need to <br/>\ndiscuss that, some do know what goes on with testing and are happy <br/>\nabout it because it provides a population their children can show <br/>\nsuperiority over. ;) So I would approach it different ways depending <br/>\non the audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d probably start by pricking holes in their assumptions about how <br/>\nwell schools are doing for their children today.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn == The Schools Our Children Deserve<br/>\nFrank Smith == The Book of Learning and Forgetting<br/>\nSteven Harrison == The Happy Child: Changing the Heart of Education<br/>\n<br/>\nThese three books all offer strong arguments for finding good <br/>\nalternatives and well researched examples of how schools today are <br/>\nnot meeting students real needs and how testing is not only an <br/>\ninvalid indication of competence but counterproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":125337898,"authorName":"louisaem@aol.com","from":"louisaem@...","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help me explain this....","postDate":"1043176972","msgId":11791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiLjI4NGRmZTc2LjJiNWVmODBjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11790,"nextInTopic":11792,"prevInTime":11790,"nextInTime":11792,"topicId":11782,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/20/03 7:39:18 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...
