Descriptive, yes.  The best advice that I can give is to calm down <br/>\nand relax.  Their child is still right there, unchanged, needing the same time <br/>\nand attention that they needed before the diagnosis confirmed a specific set of <br/>\ndescriptors.  Unschooling will only be different in the same way that it&#39;s <br/>\ndifferent for EVERY child.  Every child is different with different needs, and <br/>\njust like you would help a child read when they can&#39;t yet, you do things for a <br/>\nchild with Down&#39;s Syndrome that they can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be a new diagnosis, but the child isn&#39;t new and the symptoms aren&#39;t <br/>\nnew, it merely adds to what they know about their child.   Breathe, relax, look <br/>\ndirectly at your child and help them in the best way that you can in each <br/>\nmoment.  That will be the case for EVERY child!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"De","from":"De &lt;Sanguinegirl83@...&gt;","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Experience unschooling with Down&#39;s Syndrome?","postDate":"1307040566","msgId":61398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDREVGNkNFRTJGMDlCMi0xMEY4LTVDOUIyQFdlYm1haWwtZDEwMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61399,"prevInTime":61397,"nextInTime":61399,"topicId":61398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a friend who just recently got a diagnosis of Down s Syndrome for her child.
