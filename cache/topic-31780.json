My boys (8 1/2 & 3) were  playing with <br/>\nballoons this morning. Kicking and tossing around ones that were  already <br/>\nblown up, blowing up more and twist-tying them shut or asking me to knot  them <br/>\nclosed. It soon turned to stuffing balloons in their clothing and being  silly <br/>\nwith that. There was some upset and then discussion about how other people  <br/>\nwant their clothing and items in them (the younger was trying to unzip his  <br/>\nbrother&#39;s pajamas and remove the balloon the older wanted to keep in there).  Then <br/>\nthey switched to popping. Wyl popped one as he was trying to put 2 (very  <br/>\nlarge) balloons against his chest and zip his p.j.s closed and the pressure of  <br/>\ntoo small a space made it pop. That stung, but it was fun, too, so he decided to <br/>\n pop one on purpose. I hear him encouraging his brother to put a balloon in <br/>\nhis  p.j.s and I glanced at them to see Wyl&#39;s hand slightly behind his body <br/>\nfrom me  and I asked what he was popping the balloons with. He hesitated then <br/>\npulled his  hand to the front to show me the paring knife he was holding. I was <br/>\nhorrified  and stunned. I didn&#39;t freak out, but I wasn&#39;t completely calm, <br/>\neither.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is the kid that&#39;s known knife safety and used sharp knives for food  for <br/>\nyears. I guess I should say I *thought* he knew knife safety-he seemed to  <br/>\nknow safety from his own standpoint. Also, this is the sharpest knife I own-not  <br/>\nthat either of the boys knows that. We talked about it for a moment and what  <br/>\ncould happen and that even though he used it on himself and didn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nhimself,  how one can&#39;t judge as well going toward someone else, plus not being <br/>\nable to  predict another&#39;s sudden movements. He seemed to be somewhat regretful <br/>\nand that  he understood the possibilities of the situation. The knife got put <br/>\naway. Not 2  minutes later, I heard them talking about popping the balloons <br/>\nagain and looked  in to see that he had now gotten the knife out again and given <br/>\nit to his 3 year  old brother to pop his own balloon.<br/>\n <br/>\nI see in hindsight that I should have talked to them about better ways to  <br/>\npop the balloons, but now I&#39;m seriously concerned about the sharp knife  <br/>\nsituation. If I remove the knives from Wyl&#39;s access, it will have to be under  lock <br/>\nand key, as he does not respect requests to leave things in certain places  <br/>\nalone (he spoiled some of his gift surprises this way), even if they are put up  <br/>\n&quot;out of his reach&quot;. Not that we do a lot of that, we just have a small <br/>\ncupboard  over the stove for a few items-mostly surprises for the boys for a later  <br/>\ndate.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt this point, I&#39;m stumped as to what to do about the knives and if I&#39;m  just <br/>\nexpecting too much &quot;respect for other people&#39;s things and other people&#39;s  <br/>\nwishes&quot; from a boy about to turn 9 in April. I&#39;m out of creative thinking ideas  <br/>\nin this department, and thought I&#39;d ask here for some of your ideas. I hope <br/>\nI&#39;ve  given all the details....<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Start the year off right.
