I love them dearly but <br/>\nthey do really horrible things to thier kids.  My sister had her <br/>\nfirst child, Chelsea when she was 14 years old.  My husband and I now <br/>\nhave custody of Chelsea and will soon adopt her.  My sister had her <br/>\nsecond child Hannah 5 months ago.  They smoke in the house and Hannah <br/>\nhas had ear infections.  And this is better than what she did for <br/>\nChelsea.  My sister got soooo drunk when she still had custody of <br/>\nChelsea that she passed out and wouldn&#39;t wake up.  The only reason <br/>\nwhy anyone knew that Chelsea (1 year old at the time) was alone <br/>\nbecause she was screaming her head off..   she was trying to wake her <br/>\nmommy up and she wouldn&#39;t!  On a softer note,  Chelsea is safely <br/>\ntucked into bed in the next room. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law is another family member that bugs me.  She has <br/>\noffered to pay for preschool several times!  She wants me to have a <br/>\nbreak.  I let them clearly know that we are unschoolers and she still <br/>\noffers.   Where&#39;s the support...?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is soooo hard dealing with family members when it comes to the way <br/>\nthey treat thier kids.  YOu just want to snatch up thier babies and <br/>\ntake them home, but you can&#39;t.  We are a family of 4 on an income of <br/>\n45 a year and yet my sister in law who&#39;s husband is a lawyer has to <br/>\nplan her pregnancy around her work schedule........... work would <br/>\njust kill her if she missed the busy season!  Needless to say they <br/>\ndon&#39;t plan on having kids any time soon.  We should be thankful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a public schooled child and daycared.  My mom and dad where <br/>\nhorribly neglectful so leaving them often was a good thing.  The <br/>\nnegative experiences have helped me to be a better mother.  Maybe her <br/>\nkids will beable to turn the table around for themselves as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16673,"nextTopicId":16632}}
