Mrs. Karahur<br/>\n(from Germany) told me that a Little French Boy was<br/>\ngoing to move to Punta Gorda, and it had been arranged<br/>\nfor him to be in her class and I was to be a Special<br/>\nFriend to him. The family was delayed, and we moved to<br/>\nOrlando for the summer and then to Ocala in the fall.<br/>\nWe missed. I was very disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1968 when I started at FSU I met my 1st husband in<br/>\nmy German language class.  One of his house mates was<br/>\nChris VonChamier who became a special friend. He later<br/>\ntaught German at FSU (he was fired because he gave all<br/>\nof his students &quot;A&quot;) Mrs. Karahur was his family&#39;s<br/>\nsponsor when they immigrated to the USA from Germany<br/>\nvia France.  He was the Little French Boy that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t meet until 1968.  His (later) wife (they had 5<br/>\nchildren before they got married and divorced and<br/>\nstill live together) is a special friend mine, too. <br/>\nTheir son Christoff Wolfgang Michael VonChamier is my<br/>\nGodson, and is still Huck&#39;s (DS2) best friend. My<br/>\noldest two DS and Michael were together all the time,<br/>\neven though we lived about 50 miles apart.  Michael<br/>\njust stayed with us...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Chris dated Pamey Croslin in HS. And Chris was<br/>\nadopted by the psychiatrist, Dr. VonChamier, who<br/>\nturned out to be quite horrible (WWII wrecked him). <br/>\n<br/>\nChris and Chloe&#39;s 4 daughters used to sing a ditty<br/>\nwith altered words that emabarressed Huck. &quot;I got<br/>\nlucky, and married a Hucky....&quot;  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they were unschoolers, extrodinaire.....with one<br/>\nof the twins  being accepted into Veterinarian School<br/>\nin Georgia at age 11 (pending graduation from<br/>\nHS...ooops....she&#39;s attending the (very)Alternative<br/>\nHigh School in Tallahassee, now.  The school colors<br/>\nare a rainbow. My DS2 and Michael (Godson) graduated<br/>\nthere. She&#39;ll get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp......there are others, too,<br/>\nequally convoluted<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!

Well, I finally pulled<br/>\noff at a rest stop, and that same car was there, so I<br/>\nstruck up a conversation with the driver, and old<br/>\nYakima Indian man...turns out he had gone to high<br/>\nschool with my grandfather on the reservation, about<br/>\n60 years before. (we were still about 100 miles from<br/>\nthe reservation, so not like we were in an area where<br/>\nanyone would know my grandpa...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, again driving across Washington, in<br/>\nwinter, my car broke down outside of Hanford nuclear<br/>\nreservation.  I pushed it to the guard shack, and a<br/>\nman stopped to offer me a ride.  He took me all the<br/>\nway home, which was about 50 miles out of his way.  In<br/>\ntalking to him, I found out that he had gone to<br/>\nhighschool with my uncle, also on the reservation! <br/>\nThis is not a large reservation!!
