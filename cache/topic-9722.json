I also made my own nursing wear as part of the business. I <br/>\nfirst got a NOJO sling when my 2nd was born but it was too big and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it up properly and I didn&#39;t know how to use it either.<br/>\nI gave it away. <br/>\nI next saw a LLLleader with an OTSBH at a meeting w/ #3. I was so <br/>\nimpressed!<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a faithful sling user ever since. I have one in the car and <br/>\n(actually) 2 in the house! dh won&#39;t let me have more than 3 ;) so <br/>\nwhen I wanted another fabric as a distributor, I had to sell one of <br/>\nthe other ones so I could buy a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use it as much around the house now as I did w/ #3 and 4 but <br/>\nI still have to know where my sling is at all times. I LOVE the sling!<br/>\nI don&#39;t sell anymore but not because I don&#39;t love it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVenita, mom to katie 9, jon 8, rachel 5, jessica 3 and peter 1<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/mommycash/index.html\">http://www.geocities.com/mommycash/index.html</a> code: 13114</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"slings","postDate":"1033500694","msgId":9722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxLjI0MjQ3ZTU3LjJhY2I1MjE2QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9775,"prevInTime":9721,"nextInTime":9723,"topicId":9722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/1/02 12:46:18 PM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-702121308\">In a message dated 10/1/02 12:46:18 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We had a Nojo Sling when mine were little that worked<br/>\n well for us.
