We have seen wonderful things living this way and our kids continue to impress people wherever they go.People are absolutely amazed when they find out how we school.This is a mission for us.We have seen such wonderful fruit from raising our children this way that we want the world to know!We are determined that just by living this example LOUDLY people will be convinced that this is indeed the way to go.We are normal everyday, ok well maybe not everyday folks ..but we ARE normal.But most importantly our kids are smart,and it&#39;s all because we love them and let them live.OK I&#39;m getting down off of my soap box now !
