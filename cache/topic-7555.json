I asked her to tell me all the reasons a child of<br/>\nten needed to read.  For pleasure?   Parents can read to kids.  For<br/>\nsafety?  A child of ten can&#39;t legally be left alone in her state therefor<br/>\nnot being able to read &quot;Drano&quot; vs &quot;Milk&quot; is a silly argument, unless the<br/>\nchild is a toddler.  Not to mention non reading children have astounding<br/>\nmemories and function at their own homes with ease.  For what then?  <br/>\nKids are made to read early in school for the convenience of teachers,<br/>\nnot for the benefit of the children.  They have to be able to send home<br/>\nthose worksheets so everyone can see the learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the address and &#39;phone number.   I think everyone agrees for safety<br/>\nreasons kids need to know these, but young unschoolers are always with a<br/>\nparent.  At these ages, they probably can&#39;t even be at the public pool<br/>\nwithout a parent, so from the parent&#39;s perspective, short of abduction,<br/>\nthese kids won&#39;t be in a situation where they need to find their way home<br/>\nby themselves.   And let&#39;s face it, how many abducted kids get the chance<br/>\nto &#39;phone home?  Knowing address and &#39;phone number can&#39;t keep kids safe<br/>\nfrom bad guys.  Good guys would look it up for a kid.  This is one more<br/>\nthing someone else says is important, and we all jump on.  When our kids<br/>\nare out by themselves, then yes, it&#39;s good to know, but at young ages,<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re always with a parent?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe these kids would know nothing about money.  But, if it&#39;s<br/>\ntrue, so what?  Are they working yet?  Paying taxes?  Grocery shopping<br/>\nfor the entire family on their own?   What are the real reasons kids need<br/>\nto know about money, before they&#39;re on their own?  Mostly for the<br/>\nconvenience of parents.  In a few years these kids will know more about<br/>\nmoney than Granny.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son didn&#39;t learn to walk until he was about fifteen months old.  He<br/>\nwas always in my arms.  But when he wanted down, he learned to walk just<br/>\nfine.

Does anyone else have that problem?  My mother is NOT supportive of <br/>\nhomeschooling.  One of the first things I told her after we made our decision <br/>\nwas that we would not tolerate having the kids quizzed.  To my mind, it seems <br/>\nlike a sneaky thing to do.  I think it also demonstrates to the kids that <br/>\ngrandma doesn&#39;t trust mom & dad&#39;s judgment.  I know my kids would definitely <br/>\npick up on that.  It seems to me that if grandma spent her time with the kids <br/>\njust enjoying them and helping to show them what life is all about (after <br/>\nall, she does have a unique perspective since she&#39;s older than mom and dad), <br/>\nshe&#39;d see how bright and happy they are, and wouldn&#39;t feel the need to test <br/>\ntheir knowledge.  Also, if Grandma IS quizzing them, maybe they just don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to answer her questions.  Perhaps they sense the tension, and would <br/>\nrather talk about something else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think, in today&#39;s very busy world, that I&#39;d feel more comfortable if the <br/>\nkids all knew their address and phone number.  And maybe the girl does know <br/>\nthem.  After all, grandma isn&#39;t around her 24/7.  Just because she hasn&#39;t <br/>\nheard the girl demonstrate the knowledge doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate to the non-supportive grandmother thing, but if my mother wrote <br/>\nsomeone a letter like that about my family, I&#39;d be very, very angry.
