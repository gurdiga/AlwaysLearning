Forgive me if this has been <br/>\nsaid or it has blown up into a huge argument that already died down and <br/>\nI&#39;m starting it up again.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought for your 3 yo and your new dh is for the two of them to spend <br/>\nas much time together as humanly possible.  I&#39;ve been in this situation, <br/>\nand I was grateful to see my two sons bonding with my new husband.  Now <br/>\nthat my sons are teenagers (19 & 17), I often find myself wishing that <br/>\nthey had spent more time together.  It took many years before we heard <br/>\nanything even resembling &quot;you&#39;re not my father!&quot; out of either of them <br/>\n(first time a year ago, and we&#39;ve been married for 12 years).  So I <br/>\nwould say that we did a whole lot right in the bonding-with-the-stepdad <br/>\nthing.  But it&#39;s never perfect.  The way I looked at it is that my sons <br/>\nwould soon be gone from the house (don&#39;t blink!), and I would have my <br/>\nhusband all to myself for the rest of our lives.  That early time when <br/>\nthey went to rocket-launches and baseball games together was precious to <br/>\nthem, served their relationship well then, and paid off in huge ways <br/>\nwhen there was conflict later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThree year olds can be fickle and I can imagine a little one pushing one <br/>\nof you away by turns.  I say go with it.  Time is short.  And try not to <br/>\nact too possessive of your husband, because 3 yo&#39;s are also very good <br/>\nimitators.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 125","postDate":"1010848295","msgId":2528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyLjIwNzMxZDIxLjI5NzFhYzI3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2866,"prevInTime":2527,"nextInTime":2529,"topicId":2528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Meghan, I m soooo glad you and Sue met!!!
