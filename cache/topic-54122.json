That is a HUGE part of unschooling. (Caps for emphasis.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is also strewing - bring ideas, objects, experiences, <br/>\nopportunities of all kinds into their lives. We don&#39;t force them. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t force them. But we certain offer. And we often recommend, too. And <br/>\nonce in a while we say, &quot;I think you should....&quot;.  Unschooling is not <br/>\nchild-led learning. It is child-centered. It is child-considered. It is <br/>\na parent and child dance in which sometimes one leads, sometimes the <br/>\nother, and when it is going really well nobody is leading, they are <br/>\ncompletely in synh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone asks if it is okay to as if their kids want to read with <br/>\nthem, I am really worried that they are taking a far far too hands-off <br/>\napproach - a wait-and-see approach - sitting back and waiting for the <br/>\nkids to come up with ideas of what they want to do.  Unschooling parents <br/>\nare very involved in offering the world to their child. There is an art <br/>\nto knowing when to back off and when to step up and be actively <br/>\ninvolved, but even when kids are busily pursuing an interest on their <br/>\nown, unschooling parents are paying attention and readying themselves to <br/>\noffer enhancements or extensions or alternatives, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling credentials","postDate":"1274029421","msgId":54190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM5MjREMDUxMUU5NDQyMDlBMjE1NEYwMENBNTFFMDk0QExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzcDE3aitvdGZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhzcDE3aitvdGZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54189,"nextInTopic":54192,"prevInTime":54189,"nextInTime":54191,"topicId":54122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I mean, you say it even though you know that when they hear <br/>\n&gt; &quot;tutor&quot; that they think of someone sitting down and instructing the kids <br/>\n&gt; in specific subjects, which isn&#39;t what you&#39;re doing if you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reminds me of my mom insisting that I &quot;taught&quot; my kids to read. She knew <br/>\n&gt; that wasn&#39;t true - she knew they&#39;d learned without instruction, each in <br/>\n&gt; their own way and time. But she decided to stretch the idea of <br/>\n&gt; &quot;teaching&quot; to include creating a print-rich, supportive environment and <br/>\n&gt; letting nature take its course.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Pam, <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me be clear, I don&#39;t mislead them at all. I answer the question in a way they understand that my kids aren&#39;t in school and have an individualized learning experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a word brings to mind a particular scenario for one person but another scenario for another, how can we ever be sure that any words we use are understood at all? No, I think that if we use words correctly, even if they conjure different pictures in the minds of others from what we mean, if we&#39;ve used them within their given meaning, we&#39;ve done our job. If clarity is needed, then it needs to be requested. <br/>\n<br/>\n If a word has more than one meaning and I use the word correctly I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s my place to &quot;teach&quot; other adults that popular culture has given them narrow definitions of life. All life isn&#39;t just definition number 1 in the dictionary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore to my definition of tutor is the adult/guardian/teacher who is responsible for the child/student.  I am responsible for their learn experience. I provide for them individual attention through their learning years. I am their guardian/tutor/parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look at this much the same way I look at &quot;parent&quot; in general. There are many people that produce offspring, to my definition this does not make one a &quot;parent.&quot; Being a parent requires positive action in raising a child. Much like alligators have offspring, they really don&#39;t qualify as parents. Elephants, however, are very good parents, with parent child interaction well into the teen years. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things that my kids do that they have been tutored and not by me: music for example, they all have attended lessons and expanded on those lessons. The lessons were given by people who had different titles:  teacher, mentor, tutor and musician. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes in the course of events we are sitting at the table or on the sofa or outside and there are questions and answers that might be viewed by an outside observer as a tutoring session.  I consider it conversation. I&#39;m quite visual, so I use my hands & draw pictures or doodle words as I make my point. Sometimes we turn to resources, pull a book of the shelf and look at it together. And we get sidetracked: the journey from one thing to another is always exciting and we often turn and say, how did we get on this subject? <br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that at this point in our journey tutoring goes both ways. My daughter has a talent for sewing and has been tutoring me. She sits beside me and instructs me along the way.  I&#39;ve improved.  What is fabulous is that the dynamic, when developed in a healthy way, it should go both ways, no one person has all the answers. I am not offended by her &quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;tutoring&quot; or &quot;facilitating&quot; or &quot;guiding&quot; me in skill I want to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be lovely if your mom could find another word that would describe the time period your kids learned to read other than teach, but it&#39;s good that she&#39;s expanded her definitions to include more than rigid school defined &quot;teach&quot; & &quot;learn&quot;. She&#39;s trying, which is more than other grandparents. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d like the word tutor?

My first encounter with the term &quot;unschooling&quot; was several months *after* my wife and I had removed our son from school at his request and he&#39;d already reverted full-time to the lifestyle he&#39;d had before he started school, which was essentially doing what he liked and not doing what he didn&#39;t like. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem comes in the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling.  If someone reads about unschooling for academics only, then yah, that might not look much different than what they did with their kids when their kids were little.  In fact, I know homeschoolers who intentionally unschool until their kids are 6 or 7, not just by default of the school system, but in an active way.  But they are not radically unschooling and they do have the intention of doing curriculum at some point, so it looks very different from someone like me who is radically unschooling and has no intention of sending my kids to school or using curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Emily<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s the tricky situation I&#39;m in. Is what I&#39;m doing with my son &quot;radical unschooling&quot;? Perhaps if you followed me around for a day you might think that what you&#39;re seeing is radical unschooling, but in fact what I&#39;m doing is what I&#39;ve been doing since I became a parent in 1985. And coincidentally my son doesn&#39;t go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I find it confusing when radical unschooling is presented as a progression from unschooling academics to unschooling all aspects of a child&#39;s life. There was no such progression to be made in my life because I was already there.

I really do understand that unschooling is an alternative to school, therefore if a child doesn&#39;t need to be in school it seems odd to call what they are doing unschooling, but what else do we call it?  I&#39;m not saying that the simple default lack of school is the same thing as unschooling.  However, what age is &quot;school age?&quot;  School is not compulsory where I live until the age of 7.  Most people don&#39;t know that.  They send their kids at 4 or 5.  So is my 4 year old now an unschooler or do we need to wait until she would start kindergarten this fall?  Or until she&#39;s 7?  The fact is we have been doing things differently with her since she was 2, when I started reading about unschooling, *because* of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems clear to me from the origin of the term &quot;unschooling&quot; that the idea being conveyed is of either removing a child from school or not sending a child to school when he or she becomes eligible to attend.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that is the definition of the word.  Maybe there needs to be a different term for this style of parenting before the school years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When my daughter was in the first three years of her life, why on earth would it have even crossed my mind to compare her lifestyle with the lifestyle of a child who was attending school?

I know a lot of unschoolers didn&#39;t start until their kids were already in school for a year or two and pulled them out.  Or they started with curriculum.  Then, no, of course they wouldn&#39;t then retroactively compare those first 3 years to unschooling.  I knew I was going to homeschool my kids before my first one was born.  I started learning about unschooling when my daughter was 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt &quot;crosses my mind&quot; on a daily basis because I am doing things this way because of unschooling.  It is not an alternative to school until this fall (except preschool and preschool curriculum!), but it is an alternative to punishments and rewards, arbitrary restrictions on food, tv, clothes, etc.  I am actively focusing on partnering with my children and saying yes more and strewing and getting involved in their interests because of unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem comes in the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling.  If someone reads about unschooling for academics only, then yah, that might not look much different than what they did with their kids when their kids were little.  In fact, I know homeschoolers who intentionally unschool until their kids are 6 or 7, not just by default of the school system, but in an active way.  But they are not radically unschooling and they do have the intention of doing curriculum at some point, so it looks very different from someone like me who is radically unschooling and has no intention of sending my kids to school or using curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":441442501,"authorName":"katelovessunshine","from":"&quot;katelovessunshine&quot; &lt;misskate@...&gt;","profile":"katelovessunshine","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling credentials","postDate":"1273941690","msgId":54173,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzbWlycSs3ZWo0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZCMjI2Q0E4LUIxNTQtNDc3Ni1BOTY4LUQ4QkJDNTY0MkYyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54172,"nextInTopic":54175,"prevInTime":54172,"nextInTime":54174,"topicId":54122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve been in groups where &quot;knowing&quot; a person was really reading posts on a list. Then when you said you &quot;know&quot; that person, you have to say something like &quot;when we were standing in her kitchen together, she said to me...&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can become quite laborious to be as clear as needs to be when a subject is near and dear to our hearts. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, my mother dropped me at school at three. I was among the experimental students of the late 60s and 70s. I went to a school designed by Buckminster Fuller. Periodically through my school years, cirriculum would change from basics to theory & back again. I attended an alternative high school what would be called a magnet school now. Tested out. A few years later I started to college as an adult & graduated with honors. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children&#39;s story is a mix as well. My oldest went to school (he&#39;s 28). My next two (now, 17 & 18) went to school for the end of one year and the beginning of another which totalled about four months (during 1st/2nd & 2nd/3rd), when both mom & dad needed to work & the schedules weren&#39;t flexible. The youngest has been to daycare/preschool when he was 3 (during that same awful time) but has never been to school. Still all three clearly remember that experience and have navigated themselves in ways because of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have all kinds of books around the house, even text books. Some were considered cirriculum in the 19th century, some are considered cirriculum now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a friend who is a linguist, my 18 year old loves grammar. Who knows maybe he&#39;s the next Noam Chompsky, maybe he just likes playing with language? <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of time, I&#39;ve been told that we don&#39;t fit into any of the categories. I&#39;ve also been told that we fit into all of the categories at one time or another. It just depends on who wants us in or out of a particular category. I prefer no category. I don&#39;t like the limiting of check this box or check that box. Under Race they offer exclusive sub-categories, not even historically known blends and never offer &quot;human&quot; as a selection. <br/>\n<br/>\nI share this because I find labeling and categorizing problematic. There is too much that happens over the course of a life time (and certainly through generations) to say that this or that experience excluded a person from or included a person in a particular group.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers ideas about homeschooling, unschooling, etc have lead me recently to say more often than anything else, My kids are tutored. Because it&#39;s outside the normal response, it usually ends that particular thread. Experience has taught me that most questioners aren&#39;t really interested or seeking information, but they do want to label you with their preconceived ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I&#39;m asked I take the time to be clear. What I mean by tutored  is that we facilite, through a variety of ways, the skills and experiences they&#39;ll need to meet the challenges they&#39;ll have in life. It&#39;s a big job whatever you want to call it. And for each child the way is different because each of child is unique. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care for the puff-up of credentials because it seems false. Beethoven had many students who especially after his death claimed him as their teacher. Beethoven didn&#39;t need to claim any teacher and was actually quite critical of the few people who claimed to have taught him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read many books by experts who didn&#39;t have a clue about life or their subject. While some people still adhere to Dr Spock, I think the man ruined entire generations with bad advise. He was an abused child of a mentally ill mother, who by his own admission didn&#39;t know enough and never dealt with his past. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, <br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling credentials","postDate":"1273939166","msgId":54166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzbWdjditraWRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzbGo3bSs0NTk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54165,"nextInTopic":54172,"prevInTime":54165,"nextInTime":54167,"topicId":54122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"== My children weren t unschooled exclusively for the first three years of their lives.

All of that is presented as &quot;enrichment&quot;, getting them ready for school. (Well, except for responding to a baby&#39;s cries. That you are not supposed to ever do.) It&#39;s not just normal parenting. It&#39;s something special that goes above and beyond. So, in a lot of people&#39;s minds, they think of something very different from what you or I or many on this list would think of as parenting for the first 3 or 5 years. Maybe that&#39;s why, when a parent who does all of that with their babies comes across unschooling, they think they&#39;ve been unschooling. Of course, it can&#39;t really be unschooling if it&#39;s all in pursuit of a specific result, preparation for school, but they probably don&#39;t understand that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say that I unschooled my 2 younger boys from birth but I knew before each of them was born that I wanted to homeschool them. By the time my 2nd was about 6 months old I had become very interested in unschooling and had started trying to implement it into our life with our 13 year old. So, when daycare/preschool/kindergarten came up in conversation in reference to my younger boys, I would talk about our plans to home/unschool. Actually, I&#39;m getting pretty tired of the questions about what I do to work with my kids at home. I&#39;ve started giving the exasperated response that they aren&#39;t even school-age yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246186758,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;yahoo@...&gt;","profile":"sarahlexis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling credentials","postDate":"1273932510","msgId":54165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzbTlzdSs4aDg3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzbGo3bSs0NTk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54159,"nextInTopic":54166,"prevInTime":54164,"nextInTime":54166,"topicId":54122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It seems clear to me from the origin of the term unschooling that the idea being conveyed is of either removing a child from school or not sending a child","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2145756777\">&quot;It seems clear to me from the origin of the term &quot;unschooling&quot; that the idea being conveyed is of either removing a child from school or not sending a child to school when he or she becomes eligible to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was in the first three years of her life, why on earth would it have even crossed my mind to compare her lifestyle with the lifestyle of a child who was attending school?

They just have their children<br/>\nwith them rather than in school--- while life as they know it continues as<br/>\nusual and nothing has taken place in their lives that would support<br/>\nunschooling academically let alone as wholelife or radical unschooling.<br/>\nTheir kids just happen to be out of school during the summer and the<br/>\nparent(s) want/s to claim unschooling by default.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s not honestly unschooling in the least. It&#39;s just claiming a<br/>\nlabel.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, May 14, 2010 at 12:29 PM, Su Penn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:su@...\">su@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On May 14, 2010, at 11:32 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s me.

Not long after they published the third thing I sent them,  <br/>\nwhich was Public School on your Own Terms (based on truth and  <br/>\nexperience), I was no longer a columnist.  That didn&#39;t break my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was asked to write a column for Home Education Magazine.  It didn&#39;t  <br/>\npay much.  $50 a column at first, and later $100.  Every other month.   <br/>\nThat used to pay for my webpage and internet, and that&#39;s about it.    <br/>\nWhen people online complained that I wasn&#39;t nice (i.e. I wasn&#39;t  <br/>\ntelling them what they wanted to hear), and they told the editor that  <br/>\nthey would not renew their subscriptions to HEM if I was kept, I was  <br/>\n&quot;fired.&quot;  No matter that the three noisemakers weren&#39;t even  <br/>\nsubscribers.    I was hurt because it was petty and unfair, but I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make a deal about it at all.  When people wrote to ask what  <br/>\nhappened to me, or to say I was the only reason they had subscribed  <br/>\n(my supporters being actual readers of the magazine, and not  <br/>\ntroublemakers), they weren&#39;t treated very nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all old, old news, and Helen H. and I are on good terms now,  <br/>\nbut I continue to be unwilling to make nice to gain numbers (of  <br/>\nreaders, site hits, list members, facebook friends or whatever it  <br/>\nmight be).  If someone asks a question I don&#39;t coo and say sweet  <br/>\nnothings. I offer what seems might help their children have a better  <br/>\nlife.  That&#39;s not always convenient for the parent who was asking, the  <br/>\nadvice they&#39;re getting, but if we console and comfort parents about  <br/>\ntheir rotten, selfish children (as SO many parents want to be  <br/>\ncomforted), that leads in the opposite direction from unschooling.  I  <br/>\ntell them to stop thinking of their children as rotten and selfish if  <br/>\nthey want the relationship to be strong and good.  I do it because  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it help, I&#39;ve seen relationships with teens (my teens, and  <br/>\nmany others).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling credentials","postDate":"1273851628","msgId":54123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRUQ2RUVDLjcwMjAwMDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZCMjI2Q0E4LUIxNTQtNDc3Ni1BOTY4LUQ4QkJDNTY0MkYyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDZCMjI2Q0E4LUIxNTQtNDc3Ni1BOTY4LUQ4QkJDNTY0MkYyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54122,"nextInTopic":54127,"prevInTime":54122,"nextInTime":54124,"topicId":54122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
