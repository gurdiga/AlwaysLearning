Mine is<br/>\n&gt; pretty flexible; I have responsibilities each day, but the time I perform<br/>\n&gt; them is flexible.. of course after a full day w/ two little ones, I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily able to focus on work late at night after they go to bed, or<br/>\n&gt; wake up early after a night of nursing to get my work done before my husband<br/>\n&gt; goes to work.. So I try to keep a handful of strategies and use them when<br/>\n&gt; they make sense...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have my kids&#39; toys separated into four toy boxes, and I rotate toy boxes.<br/>\n&gt; I find that my kiddos are more interested in toys after they haven&#39;t seen<br/>\n&gt; them in awhile- it&#39;s like getting new toys.. When the interest dies down, I<br/>\n&gt; bring out a new box and put the old toys away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I try to set up activities for them that they can do fairly independently.<br/>\n&gt; This is facilitated by the fact that my computer is in the playroom, so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not far from them and I can help and give input easily.. Usually it involves<br/>\n&gt; art projects- things with stickers or crayons, sometimes puzzles or simple<br/>\n&gt; games like &quot;fishing&quot; or matching. Colorwonder stuff might be a good idea<br/>\n&gt; (maybe a gift idea if finances don&#39;t allow for it right now) because they<br/>\n&gt; have products that are like paint, but they&#39;re not as messy if you can&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; right there :) Can your four year old tell you about things that he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; interested in, that he&#39;d like to do? Maybe he could help you come up with<br/>\n&gt; things that he can work on or do while you work..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For awhile I had set up a schedule for myself of times during the day where<br/>\n&gt; I would focus on work and times when I would focus on the kids. While I<br/>\n&gt; based it around our natural schedule (naptimes, meals, times that my kids<br/>\n&gt; naturally had &quot;downtimes&quot; and times that they had higher activity levels),<br/>\n&gt; it still felt unnatural to me at first. However, I found that it helped me<br/>\n&gt; be more present with everything. When I was focusing on the kids, I felt<br/>\n&gt; comfortable not thinking about work because I knew that I would have time to<br/>\n&gt; dedicate to it later; and when I was focused on work I felt better about not<br/>\n&gt; focusing on the kids for that time because I knew that they had my full<br/>\n&gt; attention earlier and would get it again. If the kids needed me during my<br/>\n&gt; &quot;work&quot; time I would certainly attend to them, but if they were entertaining<br/>\n&gt; themselves I didn&#39;t let myself feel guilty for not being with them or doing<br/>\n&gt; more with them. This helped me a lot because I found that I was just more<br/>\n&gt; productive and better at both &quot;jobs&quot; when I gave each more of my full<br/>\n&gt; attention. Otherwise I ended up doing each half..... and doing neither very<br/>\n&gt; well.. I don&#39;t really have a schedule now because it doesn&#39;t really fit into<br/>\n&gt; my life, but I still make it a point to be focused and present on each task<br/>\n&gt; that I do during the day and I still find that it helps my productivity, and<br/>\n&gt; it helps my relationship with my kiddos..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really hoping to find someone (most likely another mom) who I can swap<br/>\n&gt; childcare with, like she could take my kids for a day and I could take hers<br/>\n&gt; for a day. I feel like if I could really focus on work for one full day I<br/>\n&gt; could get a lot done and that would help relieve a lot of my pressure and<br/>\n&gt; stress.. You said that your four year old enjoys playing with friends- do<br/>\n&gt; you have parents who could come over for a playdate so the kids can play<br/>\n&gt; while you work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And one last thing- I try to remember that every once in awhile I have a day<br/>\n&gt; where things really work out well. It doesn&#39;t happen as often as I&#39;d like it<br/>\n&gt; too, but I&#39;m not sure it would even if I wasn&#39;t working. I hope that you<br/>\n&gt; have those days every once in awhile too.. I know that sometimes when things<br/>\n&gt; get to be too much it can be easy to forget about those days..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best of luck to you and I hope you find something that works for your<br/>\n&gt; family!
