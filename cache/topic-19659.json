At this point in time, statistics indicate that one in three girls is sexually abused and one out of six boys is sexually abused. Child sexual abuse is defined as any unwanted or coerced sexual contact or interaction between a child and an adult or another child. Incest, which often falls under the category of child sexual abuse, is sexual contact or interaction between family members who are not married or other people in positions of athority. Child sexual abuse can take many forms including indecent exposure, voyuerism, obscene phone calls, exposure to pornography, fondling and oral, vaginal or anal rape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf You Are Being Abused | Myths and Facts | Adult Survivors of Sexual Abuse | Resources | Protecting our Children <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a presently being sexually abused, I hope that you will consider telling someone you trust. Parents, teachers or guidance counselors are people who should be able to help you. If you tell someone and they do not believe you, I encourage you to keep on telling until you find someone who does. If you want to talk to someone about it, call RAINN at 1-800-656-HOPE or 1-800-4-ACHILD. The person who answers will not know where you are calling from and will not tell what you talk about and the phone call will not show up on your parent&#39;s phone bill. I know how scary it can feel to tell, but there are people who want to help you get out of this situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to tell<br/>\n  a.. To stop the sexual abuse. <br/>\n  b.. You will begin to feel better and heal from it. <br/>\n  c.. To be safe again. <br/>\n  d.. Hopefully, it won&#39;t happen to others. <br/>\n  e.. The abuser will realize that his or her behavior is unacceptable and get help. <br/>\n  f.. It will give other children the courage to speak up. <br/>\n  g.. Most importantly, because you respect yourself and know your rights! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Facts<br/>\nOne in three girls is sexually abused. One in six boys is sexually abused. <br/>\nOffenders are not usually strangers to children. Approximately 70-80% of abusers are known to the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn cases presently reported, 90-97% of abusers are men. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn more than one forth of all cases, the molesters also abuse other children. <br/>\n<br/>\nFemale victims are more likely to report the abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne half of victims are molested in their own home or in the home of the offender. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeterosexual males present a greater risk to boys and girls than homosexual males. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn incestuous relationship is rarely a one time occurance but can range from a single event to years of continuous violation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 75% of children who are victims of child sexual abuse do not disclose at all during their childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nSource:CONNSACCS <br/>\n<br/>\nMyths About Childhood Sexual Abuse<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t happen that much.<br/>\nIt does. One out of three girls will be sexually abused by the time she is eighteen and the same is true for one out of six boys. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbuse is most often commited by a stranger.<br/>\nMost abuse is committed by someone the victim knows and trust. Studies of pedophiles show that they most often target children and work to build a relationship before beginning the abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t happen in my neighborhood.<br/>\nYes it does. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren make up stories about sexual abuse.<br/>\nStatistics show that most reports of sexual abuse are true. Children rarely lie about abuse, nor do they usually have knowledge of sexuality which impairs their ability to lie about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoys are rarely the victims of sexual abuse.<br/>\nThis is very false. One out of six boys is the victim of sexual abuse at some point in time during his childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoys who are sexually abused are gay.<br/>\nNo they aren&#39;t. Boys who are sexually abused are boys being victimised. <br/>\n<br/>\nSexual abuse always includes fondling.<br/>\nCovert sexual abuse includes exposing a child to sexual material or sex acts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child enjoyed it, it is not abuse.<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of a worse excuse for abusing a child. Physical reactions are a sign that a body is functioning in a healthy way. Children usually feel dirty and degraded afterwards, which no one enjoys. Any sexual contact between an adult and a child is sexual abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome children seek out sexual relationships with adults.<br/>\nAll children seek affection from adults. If sexual attention is the only affection available to a child, she may settle for it. This in no way excuses the adult, who is responsible for maintaining a healthily affectionate relationship with a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse<br/>\nAs an adult, a boyfriend asked me if I had ever been sexually abused, which opened a vault of memories of abuse at the hand of my babysitter&#39;s son. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse often begin the healing process in adulthood. Often, the abuse is too fresh and recalling it is more painful than the survivor can handle. We have many other reasons for not remembering the abuse. Forgetting it and wiping it from our consciousness is one of the most effective coping mechanisms available to a wounded child. Sometimes, the perpetrator may have told us that if we told our parents they would blame us or even become ill or die if they knew what a bad child they had. At other times, the abuser was the parent, which causes immense damage to a child&#39;s beliefs about trust and the security of the world that can last through adulthood. Forgetting is sometimes the only way to handle the implications of the resulting emotions. It is entirely normal to repress memories of sexual abuse. Often, it takes until adulthood to remember and name abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what happened or how long ago the abuse occurred, we all deserve the validation of our feelings. Grieving for what was taken as a child is painful, but necessary. If you are the adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I hope you can feel proud of beginning the healing process now. Although healing might leave you in a hard to face place, you are confronting it, which shows terrific strength. If you are the supporter of a survivor, please realize that your loved one needs support now no matter how long ago the abuse happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nResources<br/>\nAbout Incest and Abuse An informative site, with chat and forums<br/>\nTeena&#39;s Page A terrific resource<br/>\nSexual Abuse Recovery A personal page, with excellent links<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks<br/>\nBeginning to Heal Ellen Bass and Laura Davis&#39; book for survivors beginning the healing process, also an excellent resource for secondary survivors who want to understand what their loved ones are going through<br/>\nThe Courage to Heal Laura Davis&#39; book guiding survivors of child sexual abuse to healing<br/>\nThe Courage to Heal: An excellent workbook written specifcially for female survivors of sexual abuse, but it contains ideas that are relevant for all of us<br/>\nThe Wounded Heart: A book offering hope for survivors. A companion workbook can also be bought, but I&#39;ve not read it.<br/>\nWhen Your Child Has Been Molested: A parent&#39;s guide to healing and recovery<br/>\n<br/>\nProtecting our Children<br/>\nChild sexual abuse is a huge problem, but it is preventable. If you are a parent looking to prevent the victimization of your child, I encourage you to read Protecting the Gift by Gavin deBecker, which presents revolutionary ideas about protecting children from danger, including sexual abuse. Please don&#39;t be afraid to talk to your children about sexual abuse. Having a conversation with him or her is your best line of defense!<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas include: <br/>\n  a.. Read a book with your child, like The Right Touch, a read-aloud written to help prevent sexual abuse <br/>\n  b.. Explain to your child that some people have &quot;touching problems,&quot; to make it feel more safe. <br/>\n  c.. Talk to your children about &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;not OK&quot; touching. Don&#39;t use the words &quot;good and bad&quot; to define types of touch. Getting a shot can feel bad, while some touching related to sexual abuse can feel good. Ask your child to label the touching in several situations as &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;not OK and discuss what to do about the latter. <br/>\n  d.. Together make a list of adults your child could tell about &quot;not okay&quot; touching. <br/>\n  e.. Don&#39;t make your child kiss or hug people she doesn&#39;t want to. If she feels that she cannot say to one person, she may not feel she can say no to the predator. <br/>\nSource: Let&#39;s Talk About Taking Care of You, by Laurie Stauffer, Ph.D. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail Me <br/>\n<br/>\nReturn to survivingtothriving.org<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright © 2002<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 25, 2004 10:36 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] autonomous learning? vs. protecting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/25/04 11:03:12 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambdkf@...\">ambdkf@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;   If someone who is brought into the family as<br/>\n  supposedly trusting and loving begins to fondle him, he might believe it is<br/>\n  normal and sanctioned.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why would he believe that if his parents don&#39;t do it, he&#39;s told it&#39;s not <br/>\n  okay, and he can call to come home at any time?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-I think the force field is great for everyday but it seems a bit like<br/>\n  tossing a child into a gun fight and saying &#39;but he&#39;s wearing his bullet<br/>\n  proof vest&#39;.   -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  A man who hugged his daughter nastily but never pressed to the point of full <br/>\n  blown molestation is NOT necessarily a candidate for messing with a little boy <br/>\n  thirty years later.

We are non-<br/>\n  coercive, attachment parenting, unschooling. Relative to his <br/>\n  relationship with my father, I am trying to be aware of how to <br/>\n  proceed in trusting ds to decide what he needs to learn and to <br/>\n  whether he chooses to associate with this man. As children, my sister <br/>\n  and I were punished with belts, switches, restrictions and shame. <br/>\n  (standard parenting in the 70&#39;s). We also had our body integrity <br/>\n  invaded by rare genital fondling, &quot;hugging&quot; with breasts touched, <br/>\n  and &quot;kisses&quot; on the mouth against our stated wishes. Our mother was <br/>\n  basically not aware of this and truly was unable to prevent these <br/>\n  invasions of our body space or hers. I recall this occurring from age <br/>\n  7ish to 15ish. My father was a young man who came from a very <br/>\n  dysfunctional family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This occurred 25-35 years ago. My father and I maintained a <br/>\n  superficial and distant relationship from several states apart. I <br/>\n  never addressed these issues and resolved that this would never <br/>\n  happen in our relationship again because of my own self value and <br/>\n  right to my body integrity. Over the years he seems to have matured <br/>\n  and we developed a long distance relationship based upon a few things <br/>\n  in common as adults: gargening, travel, etc. Always, I have been <br/>\n  vigilant about my body around him. My husband and I have visited with <br/>\n  him and his new wife a couple times a year over the past ten years.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In 2001, my husband and I decided to have a child after 18 years of <br/>\n  marriage. BIG adjustments all around! :)!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Subsequently, my father retired and moved within 30 miles of us. Now <br/>\n  he wants a family relationship with us visiting frequently. I have <br/>\n  felt obligated to have him in our son&#39;s life on a monthly basis. <br/>\n  Obviously, we have serious differences about parenting, but he has <br/>\n  only complained about access to his grandson. Recently, I have <br/>\n  addressed the fact that we use no punishments, giving info, etc. <br/>\n  instead. He stated that ds &quot;would not learn right from wrong&quot; and <br/>\n  that &quot;he believed in using fear and intimidation&quot;. I AM QUOTING HIM.<br/>\n  I offered to share my parenting books with alternative tools. <br/>\n  Basically now my son loves &quot;paw-paw&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would you continue to provide opportunities for your child to develop <br/>\n  this relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Tho your son loves his pawpaw, and you say that you and your Dad have moved to a relationship of some sort.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGrowing up, I had that 70&#39;s childhool -- belts, switches, etc -- but no personal history of molestation you describe.  I left home hating my Dad, and slowly established my own adult relationship with him.  He lives in the same town as we do, so the boys see him maybe once or twice a month.  My husband and I do want them to have some relationship with him, if only because we grew up without grandfathers.  Also, with some years to grow he&#39;s softened from my childhood days, so it&#39;s been easier.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe offers a perspective and experiences to them, shares an interest in trains, and has done some cool things with them.  He even travelled by car with 4 of the grandchildren (my oldest, my brother&#39;s kids and my sister&#39;s son) and they all had a pretty good time. Of course, by then the kids were aged 7 to 14, so it was a much more manageable group for my Dad.  As the kids grow up, each recognizes the peculiarities of their grandpa -- he&#39;s narcissistic, somewhat manic, very intense, tells corny jokes and sometimes teases unkindly -- and there&#39;s some value in learning to see thru a facade to the person underneath. <br/>\n <br/>\nKeep in mind, too, whether or not he&#39;s the kind of role model you want for your son.  Sometimes people are better as a &#39;cautionary tale&#39; role model, and opportunities arise to show this to our kids.   Andy asked us just last week, &#39;why does Grandpa always say the same things to us?&#39; referring to some silly teasing my Dad does every time the boys see him.  It was a chance to explain that some people just don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; how to talk to kids, and what might work better.  I was pleased Andy finally noticed Dad&#39;s oddities and asked about it, so we could share our feelings about it. <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.

I assume <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t discussed with him the inappropriate touching that he inflicted on <br/>\nyou as a child?  He&#39;s probably hoping you never do, or thinking that you don&#39;t <br/>\nremember.  Otherwise, I would hope he would be entirely too remorseful to <br/>\npresume he can tell you how to parent.  He doesn&#39;t sound remorseful to me, but <br/>\nrather that he&#39;s feeling entitled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would probably not leave my child alone with him, and I would set very <br/>\nstrict limits on the activities they can do together, and I would probably make <br/>\nsure my father knew why I was doing thus and that he could never earn the right <br/>\nto be alone with my child.  OTOH, a three year old doesn&#39;t understand these <br/>\nissues, and explaining to him why he can&#39;t go and do such-and-such with his <br/>\ngrandpa would be pointless, as he would never understand.  So, you have to <br/>\ncarefully control the environment when they are together, and you have to do that <br/>\nwithout your son feeling the control, so he can enjoy his time with someone he <br/>\nloves, and still not be in danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, you&#39;d have to get cooperation from your father that he would <br/>\nnot entice your son with offers of trips to the ice cream parlor, or to push <br/>\nhim on the swing alone in the backyard.
