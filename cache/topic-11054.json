Dr Antinori runs a fertility<br/>\nclinic so the babies will be part of families just like any other baby from<br/>\na fertility clinic. I would hope that the clinic would collect health<br/>\ninformation on the children, but, since it isn&#39;t in Antinori&#39;s best interest<br/>\nto have reports of unhealthy babies, I&#39;d be skeptical of the quality of data<br/>\ncollected.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr Antinori says he&#39;s against cloning just for the sake of it, but is in<br/>\nfavor of helping infertile couples that can&#39;t be helped with other fertility<br/>\nprocedures. And he&#39;s been working in the field of fertility since 1986.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of him being tempted by really good<br/>\nmoney from some rich people without fertility problems who wanted to clone<br/>\nthemselves but are those people really a threat to society and humanity?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I think cloning cheapens life. To create a<br/>\n&gt; thousand embrios and let 999 die,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How many fertilized eggs aren&#39;t viable in other fertility procedures? And<br/>\nthe body naturally gets rid of nonviable ones too. In fact I think the<br/>\nincredible process they need to go through in the lab gives us a hint to the<br/>\nincredible process of what&#39;s going on invisibly in the body.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just to prove that we &quot;can&quot; clone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no we. The majority of the scientific community is against it for<br/>\npractical as well as ethical reasons. But this isn&#39;t research being funded<br/>\nby government or corporate money. It&#39;s private funding. (Aparently heavily<br/>\nsupported by rich Asian and Arab men the SciAm article says.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s just Severino Antinori and Panos Zavos (an American fertility<br/>\nspecialist) and his clinic, Associated Researchers for Human Reproduction<br/>\n(RAPRUI).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s human emotions compelling his need to clone, not scientific<br/>\ncuriosity. I think he wants to acheive this for ego reasons. And for money<br/>\nand business reasons. His clinic exists to provide help for couples who<br/>\ncan&#39;t conceive naturally. And people are willing to pay a *lot* of money to<br/>\nget that. He has (so he says) 6000 couples from the US and 60 from Italy<br/>\nwaiting for the procedure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scary person, though, is Brigitte Boisselier. Apparently she&#39;s a<br/>\nrespected biologist working for a rather out of this world religious<br/>\norganization, the Raelian Revolution<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rael.org/int/english/index.html)\">http://www.rael.org/int/english/index.html)</a>. (They believe we were created<br/>\nby extra terrestrials in their image.) And they&#39;ve spun off a cloning<br/>\ncompany, Clonaid (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clonaid.com/)\">http://www.clonaid.com/)</a>. (If it were a science fiction<br/>\nnovel, people would think it&#39;s a schloky idea ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an MSNBC interview with her at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/602030.asp?cp1=1\">http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/602030.asp?cp1=1</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then to let this person be a science experiment from birth till<br/>\n&gt; death, never knowing what dangers might be in store for this person.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what fertility doctors and geneticists are objecting to. Not all the<br/>\nsheep born are perfectly healthy. Dr. Antinori says humans are more closely<br/>\nmonitored and tested. Of course he has a huge stake in having people believe<br/>\nthat he can eliminate genetic problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And then theres the idea that a lot of people may want to clone a<br/>\n&gt; loved one or themselves. Does that make the original &quot;obsolete&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; disposable?

What about the life of my real<br/>\n&gt; grandmother? Can anyone see how this would discount her life and<br/>\n&gt; facilitate an unhealthy denial?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a scary idea. But would you? The clone wouldn&#39;t *be* your grandmother.<br/>\nIt would just be a baby who happened to have the same genes as your<br/>\ngrandmother. Would you pay $300,000 for the process? And would you carry the<br/>\nbaby? Or would you pay someone else on top of that to carry the baby?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then she&#39;d take 50 years to grow into the woman you remembered. She&#39;d<br/>\nprobably have a similar personality but her upbringing that may have shaped<br/>\nwho she was would be entirely different. Would you want to wait until you<br/>\nwere a grandmother for that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great deal in between wanting another copy of someone who just<br/>\ndied and actually having that copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a more compelling ethical question is what about cloning a child who<br/>\nhas died.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does seem to capture people&#39;s interest though is cloning pets. If you<br/>\ntype in pets and cloning into Google it turns up over 12,000 hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I look at this <br/>\n&gt; cloning thing as a reflection of our fear of death, and desire for<br/>\n&gt; imortality. But it is only an illusion of immortality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do we have kids? We may have higher order thinking that gives us the<br/>\nillusion we&#39;re making rational decisions about having children but it&#39;s<br/>\nlower order chemistry that compels us to reproduce and makes it seem like<br/>\nsomething so energy intensive and life threatening (in the natural world<br/>\neven more so) would be a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder why scientist spend so much time and<br/>\n&gt; money trying to duplicate what mother nature already does so well<br/>\n&gt; without help instead of finding a cure for deadly diseases and a way<br/>\n&gt; to end war and famine. It realy boggles the mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Scientists are humans and they pursue what they find compelling. (Isn&#39;t that<br/>\nwhat we hope unschooling will do for our kids?) If we only &quot;allowed&quot; people<br/>\nto pursue science who investigated things that benefited humanity, who would<br/>\ndecide what was allowed and what wasn&#39;t? And would we eliminate pure<br/>\nresearch that investigates the workings of life and the universe to stick<br/>\nonly to research that solves problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit of freedom is that it allows people to pursue a huge variety of<br/>\nideas that may serendipitously lead to great things. The downside of freedom<br/>\nis it gives people the freedom to do things that many people disagree with<br/>\nor think is a waste of time.

This is<br/>\nespecially true in cloning (I think I read only 3 out of 1000 cloned embryos<br/>\nin animals are viable) but also other methods where the genetic information<br/>\nfrom the sperm is injected into the egg rather than letting the egg &quot;decide&quot;<br/>\nwhich sperm to let in. And even of the cloned sheep born that passed all the<br/>\ntests for defects, many end up suffering from nervous system disorders and<br/>\nother ailments after birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me the biggest problem isn&#39;t what genes the child carries but<br/>\nhow healthy those genes are. Natural reproduction is way better at weeding<br/>\nout the dud combinations -- and even that isn&#39;t perfect -- than is<br/>\nlaboratory reproduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Cloned Baby","postDate":"1038428313","msgId":11054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC4xN2I2MjU1ZS4yYjE2ODI5OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11055,"prevInTime":11053,"nextInTime":11055,"topicId":11054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you all heard about the baby, due soon that an Itallian Doctor claims he has cloned?
