Folks often put a barrier <br/>\nbetween themselves and their decisions that are limiting. You&#39;ve decided that <br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t healthy and part of your job is to  keep your child healthy so <br/>\nthat gives you the freedom to limit it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;This also relates to my original post, which included limiting chocolate, and to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;how we view food (what is healthy/ a healthy amount) and I know the importance <br/>\n&gt;&gt;lies in decision making skills more than in my &#39;influencing health&#39;. In looking <br/>\n&gt;&gt;at principles vs. rules, the principle for me is health so instead of &#39;no more <br/>\n&gt;&gt;TV&#39; or &#39;no more chocolate&#39; I ask things like, do your eyes feel ok? and I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;explain that looking at the screen for too long can hurt his eyes. Or with food <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I ask, &#39;does your tummy feel ok?&#39;. This seems to bring him back &#39;into his body,&#39; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;which for me is a healthy place to be. Does this look like a correct application <br/>\n&gt;&gt;of principles vs rules?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are making decisions about health that are about your own experience and not <br/>\ntailored to someone else&#39;s. You&#39;ve decided that the principle is health and you <br/>\nare  applying it to things that may have nothing to do with health. Or at least <br/>\nare unlikely to damage health in a particularly significant way. When Simon was <br/>\n14 months we went strawberry picking with his grandparents and Simon ate <br/>\nstrawberry after strawberry after strawberry. He was loving it. His grandfather <br/>\nwas absolutely certain that we&#39;d be paying for his binge later with lots and <br/>\nlots of unpleasant diapers. Turned out it was Kenneth who was unwell and not <br/>\nSimon. Turned out it was Kenneth&#39;s sensitivity to fruit and not Simon&#39;s. Maybe <br/>\nchocolate isn&#39;t something you can eat in any kind of quantity but someone else <br/>\nwill do just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are using principles as ways of getting your son to not do what you want him <br/>\nnot to do. Rather than saying __to yourself!__ my principle is health and <br/>\nexamining what you see to be unhealthy aspects of something, you are telling <br/>\nyour son &quot;oh, your eyes might hurt if you watch too much  television&quot;. Rather <br/>\nthan turning on a light or cuddling up together a bit further away from the <br/>\ntelevision or doing something alongside watching television like playing with <br/>\nlego or drawing or building with blocks, you are doing everything you can to <br/>\nstep between your son and what he wants to do. Same with chocolate. If the <br/>\nprinciple is health, look at chocolate and see if it&#39;s unhealthy. I think <br/>\nchocolate is a pretty healthy food. Wikipedia has a nice entry on chocolate, <br/>\nincluding a few paragraphs on health: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate</a> We <br/>\ndid lots of chocolate fondues. Totally messy, be prepared. You don&#39;t need a <br/>\nfondue pot, but that&#39;s kind of fun. Melted chocolate and strawberries and pears <br/>\nand apples and bananas and angel food cake or pound cake and anything else that <br/>\nyou want to dip in there. Long skewers for holding and dipping and forks for <br/>\nretrieving the ones that fall in  the bowl. It&#39;s fantastic! And you can try <br/>\ndifferent dippable foods and see what else goes well with chocolate. Cheese or <br/>\noranges or bread sticks or bacon or whatever else you want to try. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples aren&#39;t rules, but you are using them as such. Principles are a tool <br/>\nfor examining why you are making a decision. If your kneejerk response is to <br/>\nlimit something, or to say no, principles give you a place to go to see if it <br/>\nworks. So you get worried about television, you look for a principle to see if <br/>\nit works. You place it in a health concern. And respond not by limiting, but by <br/>\ntrying to increase the engagement in other things. So, you don&#39;t go to your son <br/>\nand say, you&#39;ve watched so much television your eyes must hurt. You instead mix <br/>\nit up, you play a game a little further away from the television with him, you <br/>\nsee if he&#39;d like to go to the park or play in the garden or race around the <br/>\nhouse. Or you spend some time researching your kneejerk response. Is television <br/>\ntruly a health concern? Are the findings that put television in a negative light <br/>\napplicable to a child who isn&#39;t in school, who has engaged parents, who isn&#39;t <br/>\nsitting alone watching television without folks around to talk to? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you that stress is a long term health risk. If television is in any <br/>\nway helping him to deal with a stressful situation, I would totally applaud <br/>\nthat. If you are worried about his health figure out ways not to fight with his <br/>\ndad and to make your lives happier and more peaceful all the way around. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The fear of the children being<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;influenced&#39; by violence, separation, death, love scene, etc etc is what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps one in this huge TV phobia. Letting go of these fears will help you in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; accepting TV watching more easily.<br/>\n&gt;I guess to me it&#39;s a question of, without the TV would my 3 year old be exposed <br/>\n&gt;to all that he has been exposed to through the TV, and does he need that <br/>\n&gt;exposure. It&#39;s not so much a problem, but what about the &gt;desensitized frog that <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t leap out of the boiling water because after being exposed to such heat, <br/>\n&gt;he doesn&#39;t realize it&#39;s boiling? The circumstance is what it is- fact or fault, <br/>\n&gt;fine or flawed- I just want to be the best parent I &gt;can be to my son&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The frog is a lie. The only way to keep a frog in water that is slowly heating <br/>\nup is to not let it be able to get out, or to remove it&#39;s brain according to the <br/>\noriginal study. If you aren&#39;t trapping your son or taking away his choices and <br/>\nhis options, he&#39;ll get out of the water long before it&#39;s boiled him to death. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":458624268,"authorName":"dola dasgupta-banerji","from":"dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;doladg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling *babies*","postDate":"1288672398","msgId":57972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltKzhmQUNpUXMtMUYxNThtSHpRZkY3ZnBiM0NqZDZhNW4yYXd5Y0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlhbmgyZitycHI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9S2Rab3gtYV89XzlOcTJ2M1plNjdNTTVkOGRCZl91THpyR1FDOUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPGlhbmgyZitycHI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57971,"nextInTopic":57973,"prevInTime":57971,"nextInTime":57973,"topicId":57931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I feel you must just let all that has been written to you to seep in for a few weeks.

We watch<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; movies, and all cartoons (Dora, Diego, Little Bear, Miffy), though it<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem like some of the movies he watches are geared toward olders (like<br/>\n&gt; BEE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; movie, Ants, Homeward Bound-not a cartoon)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shows that were introduced a year ago that he has been watching and now<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can voice his feelings about it and we can talk about it, I feel like<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is me helping him get through it. When the music is really dramatic and<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts to get anxious I say, that feeling is suspense and remind him<br/>\n&gt; that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is building up to something happening- usually a positive outcome. I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stopped asking to skip the part because he doesn&#39;t want that. Like I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned before he usually asks to go right to the part that<br/>\n&gt; &#39;troubles&#39; him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (the part where nemo gets captured in finding nemo for example) and we<br/>\n&gt; watch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it together and just me being there and present helps him through it.<br/>\n&gt; Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this wrong?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My decision (because it was mine more than it was my husband&#39;s) for our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family to move in with my parents came from meditation and a lot of<br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on my part, and with the agreement and support of my husband. We also<br/>\n&gt; left<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for 3 months last winter to visit my husband&#39;s native country and his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family, who are there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess our quarreling is our collective way of saying we are tired of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constant influence and pressure that comes with the living with<br/>\n&gt; extended<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family, which is why we are working toward going back to our home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe our son&#39;s way of feeling home right now is to watch his<br/>\n&gt; *favorite*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shows.

On a different page, feel that looking at the screen for extended periods of time isn&#39;t good for the eyes! I can&#39;t control my son&#39;s health, but I&#39;d like to influence his health positively. Does that look like controling? <br/>\nThis also relates to my original post, which included limiting chocolate, and to how we view food (what is healthy/ a healthy amount) and I know the importance lies in decision making skills more than in my &#39;influencing health&#39;. In looking at principles vs. rules, the principle for me is health so instead of &#39;no more TV&#39; or &#39;no more chocolate&#39; I ask things like, do your eyes feel ok? and I explain that looking at the screen for too long can hurt his eyes. Or with food I ask, &#39;does your tummy feel ok?&#39;. This seems to bring him back &#39;into his body,&#39; which for me is a healthy place to be. Does this look like a correct application of principles vs rules?<br/>\nMaybe because the introduction to the TV in such magnitude was so out of my control, since I was gone for it, I have been trying to exert too much influence to make up for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fear of the children being<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &#39;influenced&#39; by violence, separation, death, love scene, etc etc is what<br/>\n&gt; keeps one in this huge TV phobia. Letting go of these fears will help you in<br/>\n&gt; accepting TV watching more easily.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess to me it&#39;s a question of, without the TV would my 3 year old be exposed to all that he has been exposed to through the TV, and does he need that exposure. It&#39;s not so much a problem, but what about the desensitized frog that doesn&#39;t leap out of the boiling water because after being exposed to such heat, he doesn&#39;t realize it&#39;s boiling? The circumstance is what it is- fact or fault, fine or flawed- I just want to be the best parent I can be to my son.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just be patient and watch and observe.

(I was removed, unplanned, from my son for 4 weeks when this original TV immersion happened.) <br/>\n<br/>\nReading the unschooling perspectives on TV was very helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of fighting more with my husband, to include the issue of TV, I don&#39;t, and am looking for support and guidance here instead on how to come to terms with the fact that our son watches TV a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust putting the computer off in the morning means that he doesn&#39;t walk by and get reminded to watch it every time, which seems to help...when he comes up with idea anyway I put it on or go upstairs with him to the tivo TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for watching &#39;troubling&#39; things together and getting through it, it feels like that point has been really misunderstood. We watch children&#39;s movies, and all cartoons (Dora, Diego, Little Bear, Miffy), though it does seem like some of the movies he watches are geared toward olders (like BEE movie, Ants, Homeward Bound-not a cartoon) <br/>\nShows that were introduced a year ago that he has been watching and now he can voice his feelings about it and we can talk about it, I feel like that is me helping him get through it. When the music is really dramatic and he starts to get anxious I say, that feeling is suspense and remind him that it is building up to something happening- usually a positive outcome. I have stopped asking to skip the part because he doesn&#39;t want that. Like I mentioned before he usually asks to go right to the part that &#39;troubles&#39; him (the part where nemo gets captured in finding nemo for example) and we watch it together and just me being there and present helps him through it. Is this wrong? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy decision (because it was mine more than it was my husband&#39;s) for our family to move in with my parents came from meditation and a lot of thought on my part, and with the agreement and support of my husband. We also left for 3 months last winter to visit my husband&#39;s native country and his family, who are there. <br/>\nI guess our quarreling is our collective way of saying we are tired of the constant influence and pressure that comes with the living with extended family, which is why we are working toward going back to our home. <br/>\nMaybe our son&#39;s way of feeling home right now is to watch his *favorite* shows. Thank you Sandra for helping me get to this realization. <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258687292,"authorName":"Josh Moll","from":"Josh Moll &lt;josje_wosje@...&gt;","profile":"josje_wosje","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling *babies*","postDate":"1288452521","msgId":57962,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzNTYyMS43NTE1MC5xbUB3ZWI1MjYwOC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlhaGM5YyttZzhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlhaGM5YyttZzhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57961,"nextInTopic":57963,"prevInTime":57961,"nextInTime":57963,"topicId":57931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love the care my husband and son show when they tell me to get out of the television room because I would have nightmares if I would stay and watch.

I think that<br/>\nwas the most helpful advice I got as a parent of younger kids - it was<br/>\nsurprisingly practical and encouraging to simply consider at least two<br/>\nchoices and pick the better one. The next time, try to think of the<br/>\none you did choose and then one other - pick the better one. If you<br/>\nmake a choice you&#39;re unhappy with, after the fact, think then about<br/>\nwhat would have been a better choice - have that one &quot;on hand&quot; for<br/>\nnext time.<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe same opportunity can include your husband, who might gradually<br/>\nchange perspective but at his pace rather than yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last but hardly least, your child can have the same chance to make<br/>\ndecisions the same as you and his dad do.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Karl and I were walking in the field by our house. The dark was<br/>\ngathering. It was dusk. He wore sandals and had stopped because his<br/>\ntoe had gotten jabbed on something. He said he would wait for me there<br/>\nwhile I get a band-aid for him. I didn&#39;t want to do that because it<br/>\nwas by the road as far from the house as we could get. I don&#39;t trust<br/>\npeople who might drive by or stop or bother him or who knows what. So<br/>\nI told him no I didn&#39;t want to do that because I don&#39;t like where he&#39;d<br/>\nbe in the dark all the time waiting for me. I suggested some ideas ...<br/>\nwalk on the road instead of in the field, wait a few minutes, walk<br/>\nback the way we came instead of going the whole way around the block.<br/>\nHe decided to walk back on the road and as we walked his toe quit<br/>\nhurting. When we arrived home, he put on a band-aid to protect his toe<br/>\nfor a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an example of decision making. By now, Karl is 7 and he&#39;s got a<br/>\nlot of his own decision making going on as a matter of course. I say<br/>\nno sometimes. And I consider what he wants, what his goals might be<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t know about yet or that he has told me about, and show him<br/>\nways to think about possibilities by doing it myself too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny tv/video/internet viewing that Karl does goes through the same<br/>\nprocess and has for a while. He amazes me because he knows what he<br/>\nwants to see next, what he wants to follow up on, when he wants to<br/>\nstretch his legs (hence our walks), eat, take a break, pull out the<br/>\nLegos or some other thing to do with or without the tv/video/internet.<br/>\nWhen he was a toddler is when we began all that.

To have peace in your house, be more peaceful.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen nerves are frayed because of living with parents/in-laws, there&#39;s a choice to say or do things that will feed the quarreling and bickering -or- there&#39;s a choice to say or do things that will emphasize &quot;us&quot; and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and working towards that light together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was little, I remember another mom saying: &quot;When they&#39;re the least lovable, that&#39;s when they need love the most&quot;, mostly referring to when kids are whiny or melting down I suppose -- instead of getting angry or frustrated with them, be compassionate and loving.

As Sandra said, if that means he&#39;s seeing more happy faces and people having fun than he would otherwise, its a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I guess I equated a concept of unschooling with being part of the shield<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nShield isn&#39;t a great concept to try to apply to unschooling. Your son doesn&#39;t want to be hurt or upset, so its kind and thoughtful to help him avoid those things when you can the way you&#39;d tell a friend if there was an ingredient in a food she didn&#39;t like or a particular size of jeans tended to run small - useful information she can then use to make decisions about the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; if I am watching something with him, which I usually am, I am there to go<br/>\n </span></blockquote>through the things that make him confused/unsettled, etc...<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering what he wants to watch that&#39;s confusing and unsettling him - I&#39;m puzzled.

Mo periodically wants to watch something that&#39;s going to have parts that upset her. I try to let her know in advance that there&#39;s going to be content she won&#39;t like and in the past she has come up with a whole bunch of strategies for dealing with that - she might cover her eyes or leave the room or if its a dvd watch the extras first, or watch the movie in another language. I&#39;ve never tried to help her &quot;get through&quot; the upsetting parts other than helping her work out strategies ahead of time and supporting her in the moment - so for instance if we&#39;re watching a movie as a family that none of us have seen before and Mo wants it turned off, we turn it off and look for an alternative (maybe Mo and I will go in another room while the guys watch the movie, for example). <br/>\n <br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":436709932,"authorName":"ceepee12","from":"&quot;ceepee12&quot; &lt;crperlow@...&gt;","profile":"ceepee12","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling *babies*","postDate":"1288377635","msgId":57950,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlhZjRmMys3dXFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZCREI2OTQwLUVGMkYtNDkzMC1BMEYwLUNBMTI1NkQ5OUZFOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57948,"nextInTopic":57951,"prevInTime":57949,"nextInTime":57951,"topicId":57931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Now the babes are 1 yr and 3 yrs old, both boys.<br/>\nI have been lurking on this forum for about a month and am looking for advice on the early stages of unschooling. <br/>\nI actually feel like I am doing some deschooling with 3yo at the moment because I had my *no*-based rules, like no more tv/chocolate, and that was pretty much it... So I have been really consciously trying to ease up with those no&#39;s. <br/>\nI guess my children are my own best guides on how to weave unschooling in with these earliest years of development. Obviously there can be no time that&#39;s *too early* to apply the unschooling foundations.<br/>\nSometimes from somewhere in the back of my mind (from how my own childhood was structured?) it kicks in that, I *need* to tell him when enough tv/chocolate is enough, to teach him, in fact I have until recently...<br/>\nI think the answer in an unschooling way to the TV is that he is learning a tremendous amount from watching his &#39;favorite shows&#39; as he calls them, and that is why he asks to watch them. It also seems that if something is puzzling or troubling to him he asks to watch it again and again. My (learned) instinct is to try to shield him from this trouble, because he is *obviously* too young for it.  <br/>\nThe protection instinct is so strong still at this age, it is always me reminding myself to trust the circumstances given to us and to trust ourselves to navigate them together. <br/>\nThanks to all for the support and sharing that goes on here!<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57992,"nextTopicId":58022}}
