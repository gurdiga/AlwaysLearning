He learned playing video games online and memorizing words like:<br/>\nPlay, Game, Yes, No, and so on. He also wrote before he could read at 3.  He used letters to write Thomas ( his favorite Tank Engine)   copying from the name written under the toy train, he also wrote his name at 3 and would ask me to write down something and he would copy it. By 5 he wanted to communicate online while playing so I used to sit with him and type or spell the letters so he could type. For a while I even had to point out the letters to him and sometimes he knew which one they were and then the next day he did not  and the next he did remember. Then he could pick out short phrases from the list on the game he played like:&quot; Wanna be friends&quot; or &quot;Follow me&quot;. Suddenly he could read everything and when he was fluently reading he started asking questions about why a word sounded that way but shouldn&#39;t it be this other way. He played a few phonics games when he was young and they made no sense to him and he really got nothing out of them.<br/>\n Phonics made no sense to him at all until he was fluently reading. I   think if you ask what a letter sounds like he would look at you like WHAT?<br/>\n<br/>\nToday he is a fantastic speller  and he reads really really well.<br/>\nWe test annually in Minnesota to comply with the State Law and he tests  on a 4th grade level reading and 7th grade in spelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old just wrote her name for the first time last month but she has been typing for a while. She likes to type little notes to friends on the computer. I spell and point to  the letters  and she types.  That is about it for now. A few short months ago she made lines when she signed her name. I trust she will learn and I help when she wants, I get her favorite book and find new ones she might like at the library. I help her type notes for her friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not worried at all. She loves books and being read too. She will learn when ready.

My son will be 12 soon and it&#39;s becoming a niggling worry to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy way of background, I pulled him out of school 4 years ago, a few months into grade 3.  Unfortunately by then his self esteem had already taken a big hit in this area.  On top of that, he was never one to willingly try new things or work at something if he wasn&#39;t immediately successful, so this was a very bad few years for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis letters are often backwards and he forgets to put spaces between words. I think there is a physical uncomfortableness with it as well, so there is possibly a hard-wiring aspect to this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, he also really dislikes typing and avoids this too.

I just can&#39;t get past the guilty feelings that I contributed to screwing up his attitude towards writing by keeping him in school for so long and I really want to find a way to help him get past this negativity.
