The creator of minecraft Notch likes terraria which someone mentioned already.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard 101 is a nice mmo type video game that&#39;s targeted to 6-14 years old. Not necessarily for the builder type, but my 5 year old loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few toys/items not games that might interest your son with some more expensive than others. This first one is my favorite and its made for 8+ I believe I have not yet gotten it for my son by I plan on it this coming Christmas even though he won&#39;t be quite old enough for it I plan on doing it with him. This product is Lego Mindstorms NXT. It is a Lego product as such you can build your own stuff, but it also includes many pieces of programmable hardware including logic chips, motors to control, and many other things. Universities and such use it to their students about robotics. Its lego&#39;s to build robots basically and you must program them to do the things you want. So not only does your child use his imagination building and programming things, but he much learn programming, and electronics. As a 10 year old I think this would be perfect for your son. It is expensive and you are looking at $225 or so just to get started. You can buy additional parts as needed. You basically get a fun way for your child to learn electrical/computer engineering concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a child radio shack had electronic hobby &quot;learning lab&quot; where you could make your own  electronic type items. They still make stuff similar<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3814337#\">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3814337#</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthis is the type of thing I am talking about and there are many different kinds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother item would be an Arduino board. Its an electric hobby board the purpose would be close to the same as the lego mindstorms except you aren&#39;t building robots although you can. the arduino has a huge following. Someone mentioned instructables.com I know they have many different arduino ideas there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are actually quite a few different types of electronic boards that are very similar to arduino, but are cheaper, or serve a slightly different purpose. One imparticularly isn&#39;t out yet, but its called the raspberry pi. Its a $25 &quot;pc&quot; computer board with everything needed to be a very basic computer. Its got video output, input device support, ram and a cpu. It&#39;s great for tinkering and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more idea. Ebay. I have done an ebay lot of legos, but there are many other things that are just as fun, but different than legos.<br/>\n<br/>\nTinker Toys<br/>\nConstrux (I used these as a child love them)<br/>\nK&#39;nex<br/>\nLincoln Logs<br/>\n<br/>\nThese used are generally decently cheap on ebay and you can find people that package them in big lots which make them way cheaper than going to the store. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s a quick brainstorm of ideas I have for my Deuce when he gets older.
