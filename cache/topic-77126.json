That requires, readable posts, carefully composed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI edited two to remove the long (very long) original post.  <br/>\nI edited one because the three-paragraph quote wasn’t sufficiently marked as different from the new comments.<br/>\n“Pointy brackets,” the less-than/greater-than marks, sometimes don’t go through, as some mail reader somewhere will think they’re html code, so use something like ***that*** or -=-this-=- because it will stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut spaces between paragraphs, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t “be supportive.”  Don’t tell people they’re great moms or that they’re doing the best they can.  You don’t know that, and I don’t want to provide a forum for people to soothe those who should be doing better.  <br/>\nHow bad can that be?  Pretty bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly read 2/3 of this page if you’re in a sensitive mood—and note all those bad examples (which seemed sweet and supportive).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/support.html\">http://sandradodd.com/support.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77118,"nextTopicId":77119}}
