I wasn&#39;t sure whether I should tell  <br/>\nthem it was wheat or not. I knew that the disappointment of that would  <br/>\nmake them cry and feel deprived and ashamed of being different. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might have helped them to know that the cake part was wheat but  <br/>\nthat the icing part was not.  I have witnessed plenty of children  <br/>\nenjoy just the icing part off their cake, sometimes to the annoyance  <br/>\nof their parents.  Admiring the cake with them and talking about how  <br/>\nbeautiful it is is another way to join in the fun.  Your concern over  <br/>\nspoiling the beautiful &quot;cake moment&quot; with the reality of future pain  <br/>\nis understandable but there are usually more than two options.   <br/>\nPerhaps the disappointment of what was in the cake, wheat, could be  <br/>\nsoftened by really enjoying the presentation and eating as much of the  <br/>\nfrosting as they wanted.  They could decide for themselves whether the  <br/>\npain of having wheat was worth tasting the cake part or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48573,"nextTopicId":48562}}
