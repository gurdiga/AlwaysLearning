However, I soon ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619879495\">As you may know, I recently joined the list. I am Homeschooling Brianna,<br/>\naged 10.<br/>\nWhen we first started, I had the idea of a curriculum. However, I soon<br/>\nrealized that it was not to be. Not for her. Not for me. I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nshackled to a clock, whether hourly or monthly. I also didn&#39;t want to make<br/>\nBrianna study something that she wasn&#39;t interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a home business. So it was natural that Brianna do her studying in<br/>\nmy office, (which is really our living room) Brianna has always been very<br/>\ninvolved in the business. We set up at powwows, (Brianna is a Fancy Shawl<br/>\nDancer) feasts (not so many, we prefer powwows) and we go to some &#39;old age&#39;<br/>\nhomes and set up there. We have a price structure that Brianna & I have<br/>\nworked on. For example, we offer Military or Veteran discounts. We offer<br/>\n&quot;Golden discounts&quot;, we have a Crones discount, heck we have family<br/>\ndiscounts, well, you get the point. All of these discounts have to be<br/>\nfigured, written, accounted, Brianna can do that.<br/>\nBrianna can pitch a tent, inflate the air mattress, set up our 10&#39;X20&#39; store<br/>\ntent (she needs help, but no direction), set out our stock, sell it, make<br/>\nchange, she&#39;s very good at what she does. She is very involved in theatre<br/>\nand has a puppy and takes horseback riding lessons. She likes math and will<br/>\npick up the Addison Wesley Math book for grade 4. She loves science and has<br/>\na number of experiments going on at any given time, many of which are<br/>\nforgotten or somehow disappear (maybe they&#39;re living with all that minutiae<br/>\nof ours lives that disappear?)<br/>\nShe&#39;s a very smart girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here&#39;s my question; Are we unschooling? Does her use of a textbook<br/>\nfall outside of the unschooling parameters? Is there a place/site that will<br/>\ntell me more?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know much. I do know that no one can take care of her as I will. No<br/>\none treasures her as I do. I had her in public school. It was not good, not<br/>\ngood at all. She was finished with her school work by Tuesday and then<br/>\nwasted the rest of the week drawing or helping the class bully. He sat in<br/>\nher group because of his last name. He is a victim of benign neglect on the<br/>\npart of his parents. Long about the last time he hit her, I was informed<br/>\nthat the school could not do anything about it. There were over riding<br/>\nissues that I was not aware of. Well, if they can&#39;t teach her and can&#39;t<br/>\nprotect her, why is she there?<br/>\nSo anyway, there you have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we unschooling?<br/>\nPlease, are there links that will help clear up this confusion?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific Shampoo!","postDate":"1043789565","msgId":11982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOC4yMThhYjdiMi4yYjY4NTBmZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11979,"nextInTopic":11989,"prevInTime":11981,"nextInTime":11983,"topicId":11959,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/27/03 11:31:14 PM Central Standard Time, ...
