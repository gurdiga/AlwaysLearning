When Harvest Moon premiered","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1837565863\">Description from a webpage:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe N64 update of the cult culturation classic is one of the most charming <br/>\nentertainments of the year. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Harvest Moon premiered on the Super NES in 1997, many gamers turned up <br/>\ntheir collective noses at the idea of an RPG game based on operating a farm. <br/>\nBut even in the shadow of the revolutionary N64 this down-home Pak whipped up <br/>\nquite a stir and a loyal following of dedicated virtual farmers! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you missed the fun of Harvest Moon for Super NES, you owe yourself a shot <br/>\nat the good life on Nintendo 64. The new edition is based on the same premise <br/>\nas the original: grandpa leaves you alone on his run-down farm, and your goal <br/>\nis to turn it into a successful enterprise, find a wife, and live happily <br/>\never after. As in real life, this is easier said than done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some unusual customization choices (you get to name your character, dog <br/>\nand farm and pick your birthday!), friendly characters gently school you in <br/>\nthe rudiments of rustic life. Should you forget anything, the game offers an <br/>\nextensive series of tutorials. <br/>\n<br/>\nClearing the land, amending the soil and planting and nurturing crops takes <br/>\nup much of the early part of the game. As you prosper, you&#39;ll want to buy and <br/>\ncare for sheep, chickens and cows. You&#39;ll even get a gift horse. Just be sure <br/>\nnot to look it in the mouth! <br/>\n<br/>\nAll work and no play makes for a dull farmer, so make frequent tracks for <br/>\nnearby Flower Bud Village. Besides stocking up on seed, tools and fortifying <br/>\nfoodstuffs, the village is populated with five young women intrigued by an <br/>\nambitious chap like you. Elli, Maria, Popuri, Karen and Ann are an extremely <br/>\nwell-bred lot, so you&#39;ll have to work as hard on your wooing as you do on <br/>\nyour turnip crop. <br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, the villagers enjoy quite a busy social calendar. There are more than <br/>\na dozen activities throughout the year, beginning with the Planting Festival <br/>\nin the spring and concluding with a New Year&#39;s bash. In between there is a <br/>\nFirefly Festival, a Harvest Festival, two horse races and Thanksgiving, plus <br/>\nample opportunities to upgrade Flower Bud&#39;s infrastructure by repairing a <br/>\nbridge and opening the Mountain Spring. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can grow seven different crops, ranging from the humble turnip to the <br/>\nhighly lucrative strawberry. But once in a while you&#39;ll want to wander off <br/>\nthe old homestead. The hills and woods roundabouts are alive with mushrooms, <br/>\ngrapes, medicinal herbs and even more bizarre botanical specimens. Fish <br/>\nnibble in a nearby pond. In winter, you can keep the cash coming in by mining <br/>\nfor precious minerals. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy and large this is a fairly faithful sim of rural life that&#39;s punctuated by <br/>\nsome extremely fanciful excursions. A nearby cave is the home of an elf who, <br/>\nfor some mysterious reason, speaks pig latin. A seldom-seen nymph cavorts in <br/>\na pond and a Moonlight Stone lies buried deep beneath the earth. Small <br/>\nwonder, then, that the villagers dedicate a year-ending festival to scaring <br/>\naway troublemaking ghosts! <br/>\n<br/>\nHarvest Moon 64 scores your accomplishments after two years. Like farming <br/>\nitself, though, this open-ended Pak encourages you to keep on playing, year <br/>\nafter year. You&#39;ll keep digging up well-buried nuggets of fun, like a recipe <br/>\nfor &quot;Steamed Clams with Wine&quot;! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis unusually tranquil RPG is an exceedingly pleasant diversion. Our main <br/>\nbeef is that female RPG fans -- and they are legion -- might be miffed by <br/>\nhaving to play as a male character.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/games/gamepage/description.jsp?gameId=124#about\">http://www.nintendo.com/games/gamepage/description.jsp?gameId=124#about</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Harvest Moon","postDate":"1023491569","msgId":7513,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlLjI3OGE2MGE0LjJhMzI5N2YxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7510,"nextInTopic":7514,"prevInTime":7512,"nextInTime":7514,"topicId":7510,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/02 2:31:58 PM, lisa@breger.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1671228146\">In a message dated 6/7/02 2:31:58 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisa@...\">lisa@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Is this a board game, made up game, or what?
