Why some people see<br/>\nunschooling as being neglectful. Yet again, evidence that this is a<br/>\nparadigm shift that some people just don&#39;t get. And perhaps why unless you<br/>\nrealise it is a paradigm shift you may in fact practise neglectful<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Search for &quot;safe to let toddler play in traffic&quot; and you won&#39;t find<br/>\n </span></blockquote>validation :) No articles by anyone doubting that letting your child play<br/>\nin traffic is dangerous. No scientific studies claiming it is safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis takes me back instantly to when five years ago when I was presenting<br/>\nto city councillors in Cambridge UK requesting that they consider an<br/>\ninnovative design for a &#39;home zone&#39; on our quiet backstreet of the city<br/>\nbeing used as a &#39;rat-run&#39;. I had carefully worked up a design for a &#39;shared<br/>\nsurface&#39; with an architect. One of the councillors got very agressive with<br/>\nme. He couldn&#39;t take the level of innovation in our design. Another said to<br/>\nme &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for anyone to encourage their children to play<br/>\nin the streets with cars around; you&#39;d be being a neglectful parent&quot;. It<br/>\nwas very frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nCars and children can use the same place given the right conditions. Remove<br/>\nthe boundary between pavement and road and you change the paradigm. You can<br/>\nadd signs saying &#39;you are entering a home zone&#39;, you can change the colour<br/>\nof the &#39;shared surface&#39;. You can tell people: &#39;Here is something different.<br/>\nStop your usual way of operating and pay attention&#39;. Cease operating on<br/>\nauto-pilot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd guess what? By doing so you significantly reduce the risk. But more<br/>\nimportantly you significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the fear. You can&#39;t<br/>\neliminate the risk necessarily but you can reduce the situation to basic<br/>\nhumanity . You trust that drivers don&#39;t want to kill children and that<br/>\nchildren have an innate ability to judge risk. It works. I know because I<br/>\nlive now in a country (the Netherlands) where shared surfaces and home<br/>\nzones are commonplace. Sadly some people are just not up to accepting such<br/>\n&#39;radical&#39; ways of thinking. The crux of the argument is in the detail of<br/>\nthe situation and interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Commentary on unschooling","postDate":"1362238569","msgId":70768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtndDY5OStudjBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTjg1OTdhdF9lR3BxYjdwK09xN3hYSkxlbzRpd290aDY0SGRXRDlEQzVLNEd3ZnJqUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70766,"nextInTopic":70770,"prevInTime":70767,"nextInTime":70769,"topicId":70724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes people don&#39;t like to learn &quot;in front of&quot; other people. I was just writing about that elsewhere, in regards to a kid who&#39;s afraid to try new things. One of the problems with internet text-only communication is that there&#39;s no good way to really watch what other people are doing and learn from it. At best, we can trade ideas and tell stories and try to dig down into the words we use to do that for more ideas. That sets people up to feel exposed - not necessarily a bad thing. At my job, I often feel exposed and vulnerable because we&#39;re all working in the same big room And we all check each others&#39; work before it goes out the door as part of our quality control process. And I&#39;m the new guy - everyone looks extra hard at my work So That I can learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people complain that lists like this one don&#39;t &quot;model&quot; unschooling very well but in fact what&#39;s being modeled is a kind of thought process. Like a parent verbalizing how he or she solves a particular kind of problem so a kid can witness the processes which mostly go on internally. I hadn&#39;t really thought of it in those terms before. And just like modelling as a parent, what&#39;s actually learned will vary a lot. My daughter gets annoyed with me if I verbalize while I do something - but she&#39;s happy to be handed a book of instructions. Ray likes to hear what other people have to say but he&#39;s also good at letting most of it wash through him and pulling out what&#39;s interesting to him in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my job (I re-upholster furniture) if someone else makes a mistake, I&#39;m interested in seeing it - some of that is for the reasons Toni brought up: it&#39;s reassuring and makes me feel more competent. But I also love mistakes because I get to watch my more experienced co-workers solve problems. My boss is really creative when it comes to fixing and hiding mistakes. Her son isn&#39;t quite as creative but he&#39;s a talker - he&#39;s really good at articulating his thought process so I can &quot;see&quot; him thinking things through. To me, that&#39;s gold. I can figure things out, but it helps a lot to know how to think about the problem in the first place - it goes a lot faster. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone likes that or learns like that.

For me the experienced unschoolers on this<br/>\nlist have a job to do, and a role to perform, and  when we do something we<br/>\ntry to do it with as much competence as possible. I don&#39;t think people get<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are uncomfortable because they are in a different place, and feel<br/>\nunsure and vulnerable. Others expressions of vulnerability makes them feel<br/>\nless alone (and for some it makes them feel more competent) and other<br/>\npeople&#39;s confidence and knowing makes them feel more vulnerable.<br/>\nUnfortunately people can&#39;t acknowledge this and own it, instead they expect<br/>\nand need others to feel vulnerable with them and be in the same place.<br/>\nPeople need to manage there own expectations and recognise their own<br/>\ncompetence even when they feel unsure and are around others with more<br/>\nexperience. Not just hand it away and locate all their competence in<br/>\nsomebody else, then blame that fantasy competent person by implying they<br/>\nhave set themselves up as gurus. I think it is the experienced unschoolers<br/>\nwho are being set up as guru&#39;s by those who are struggling to manage their<br/>\nvulnerability and who are then complaining. I understand why it&#39;s hard for<br/>\npeople and where they are at, but it is not ok to be unkind and devalue<br/>\nwhat others are offering. If it&#39;s not for you, don&#39;t be destructive,<br/>\njust be polite and walk away. Some people want experienced Unschoolers to<br/>\nbe either their (fantasy) parent or their peers. Experienced Unschoolers<br/>\nare people, they give their time to help others.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling a bit defensive, mostly because I work in a similar role in another<br/>\nfield.

They were saying in a light hearted kind of way. But it disturbed me. It disturbed me in the way that it disturbs me when one parent recommends tough love to another parent. It disturbed me in a dangerous recommendation to an open audience who may walk away thinking, well, let the children get on with it. Let them fill their own world with whatever and I&#39;ll go publish my magazines and knit my socks and read my books and get on with my life. It was bad advice. Very bad advice.

Were seeking out measured and clear ideas and working to give those kinds of ideas to others instead of muddled thinking, poorly examined, anything goes, no definition is better than another definition, don&#39;t blame the victim ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Always Learning &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent: Saturday, 2 March 2013, 3:56<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Commentary on unschooling<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is commentary from someone who refused to use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; until just recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wendypriesnitz.com/blog/unschooling-is-not-one-size-fits-all.html\">http://www.wendypriesnitz.com/blog/unschooling-is-not-one-size-fits-all.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things especially interested me.

Two or three times over the years people have come and said that about strewing.  That it&#39;s coercive or manipulative.  The way I do it, it&#39;s not.  I&#39;ve never said &quot;Look, I left something on the counter.  Aren&#39;t you going to play with it?  Seriously.  It&#39;s science.  It&#39;s history.  Do it.&quot;    If I leave a sundial or something, they&#39;re going to mess with it.  If I leave a little catnip toy on the floor, my cat&#39;s going to whap it around, too.  Am I manipulating my cat into playing, against his will?  When he gets older he&#39;ll probably be less likely to play with such things.  Maybe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people do something fun because they want to, it&#39;s a heck of  a stretch to call that coercion.  And who would stretch so far?  I think maybe lazy people who hope unschooling is nothing, that there&#39;s no &quot;good unschooling,&quot; just a simple lack of school and curriculum.  People who want to think that nobody knows any more about unschooling than they do might want to make those stretches.  If they want to assert that if they say they&#39;re unschooling, they are (whether the kids are learning or happy or not), then they might want to insult others who are actively providing and maintaining a rich unschooling nest.  And if they like to say that learning happens all the time, so whether the parents are paying attention to the kids, or being interesting, or providing a variety of cool stimuli or not, it&#39;s all the same thing.  (Oh, no, wait.  Not the same thing.  Better NOT to provide, because that&#39;s coercion.   If the parents are interesting and kind, is that coercion?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want those people to come to my house.
