I hold people&#39;s hands <br/>\nthere and tell them their children really will learn to read.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nexpecting to do that here.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If newbies didn&#39;t post and just read how would<br/>\nnewbie&#39;s questions get answered?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe by just reading?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What if a newbie had<br/>\na burning question that maybe old news to long-timers?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this involved a newbie&#39;s burning question.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But I do think that if a<br/>\nnot-so-confident newbie read it, they may not feel<br/>\ncomfortable asking a question or stating an opinion. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say none, I said &quot;less.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;but those with less experience<br/>\nshould probably do more <br/>\nreading and less writing at first, at least.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I walk up to a conversation in progress, I listen a while.  Maybe it&#39;s <br/>\nnot the sort of thing I can or should get into.  Maybe it is.  But I wait, <br/>\nand see how it&#39;s going.  And if I did join it, I wouldn&#39;t totally change the <br/>\nsubject and ignore all indications that it wasn&#39;t appreiciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I feel that would be a shame for this list and could<br/>\npossibly make it a bit stagnant, with only the<br/>\n&#39;experienced&#39; unschoolers choosing the subjects<br/>\ndiscussed. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWHY would it be (a strong word) SHAME?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this group will be stagnant.  I don&#39;t think experienced <br/>\nunschoolers discussing things would feel stagnant at all.  And there are TONS <br/>\nof unschooling lists, sites and forums, I&#39;m pretty sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it our duty to help new unschoolers?  I know of not one of the &quot;old <br/>\ntimers&quot; here who has not put in hundreds or thousands of hours doing so, and <br/>\nmost are still doing it.  I got a newsletter just today written and mailed <br/>\nout by Carol Narigon.  She&#39;s been helping other unschoolers since Holly <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t speak English.  What if Carol and I and some of our other veteran <br/>\nfriends wanted to have a list where we could be with other experienced <br/>\nunschoolers?  Would that be a shame?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And this subject may have never come up if a newbie<br/>\nhadn&#39;t posted about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems the same subjects do come up every six months or so.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I, personally, haven&#39;t been tracking all of it because<br/>\nI&#39;ve been busy and the sheer volume has been<br/>\noverwhelming for me right now (I&#39;m still days behind!)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a shame in itself, that the volume of posts surpassed previous <br/>\nmembers&#39; ability to keep up with them. But it will pass, and live will go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am grateful for all the insight and awareness of the<br/>\nmore experienced unschoolers on this list have to<br/>\noffer, but does that mean that the rest of us have<br/>\nnothing meaningful to offer or contribute? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been discussed to death, sorry.
