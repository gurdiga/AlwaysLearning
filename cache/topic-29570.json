Adults will<br/>\noften choose to practice skills once they can see a reason for doing<br/>\nso, but often &quot;practice&quot; those skills by means of choosing a project<br/>\nthat relies heavily on the skills in question.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m playing a sonata (just the movements I like, probably) I&#39;m  <br/>\njust playing.  If I try something new I&#39;ve never tried before, I  <br/>\nmight find something in there I like and I&#39;ll go through it the next  <br/>\nfew times I come to the piano, and I&#39;ll either like it more or less  <br/>\n(just like anything--tv shows, restaurants, CDs, people) and if I  <br/>\ndecide it&#39;s worth having in my life longterm, those passages that  <br/>\naren&#39;t readable to me....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOOOOH!   REMEMBER THIS TANGENT<br/>\n<br/>\n...those passages that aren&#39;t readable to me, I&#39;ll work through over  <br/>\nand over (IF I&#39;m in the mood, because I have no deadline of a lesson  <br/>\nor performance) until I &quot;know them&quot; in a way other than the way I&#39;m  <br/>\nknowing the other parts that came easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp above, in full word-flow, I wrote &quot;aren&#39;t readable to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this can tie in to my ever-ongoing thoughts about how reading  <br/>\nworks and what it means &quot;to read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith apologies to those who will not know what I&#39;m writing about, you  <br/>\nmight just skip the next few paragraphs and go to this point ****<br/>\n<br/>\nI most like Baroque music.  In the music-reading area, it&#39;s very  <br/>\nvisual to me.  I don&#39;t count it out, I go by the patterns against  <br/>\npatterns of the left and right hands.  Sometimes each hand is just  <br/>\nplaying one note, each hand a stream of notes going in different or  <br/>\nparallel or some of each directions (contrapuntal/counterpoint).  I  <br/>\nlike that kind of vocal music too.  I like harmonies like that in  <br/>\nfolk and popular music too, though parallel thirds are more common.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of reading horizontally left to right, though, I&#39;m kinda  <br/>\nreading vertically, by half measures or whole measures, and I see the  <br/>\nrelationship of the two parts, and I read them like whole phrases and  <br/>\nrelationships.   When one comes that I have to count out and that I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t hear by seeing, as it were, then I revert to the counting and  <br/>\nthinking of note names that I was not using at all before.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people read fluently they can look at a phrase like &quot;look at a  <br/>\nphrase&quot; and see it whole, or at least see it as a kind of passage of  <br/>\nmusic, or a section of a recipe, or like if you were reading  <br/>\ndirections for building, you would see 2x4 stud  and not think of  <br/>\neach number or letter, but see a picture of a 2x4 in your mind and  <br/>\njust have to look for the part that shows how long they want you to  <br/>\ncut it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen anyone reads, no matter how good they are, they have a strategy  <br/>\nfor words they don&#39;t know, that don&#39;t just flow into their mind  <br/>\nwithout analysis.  Some sound it out.  Some look it up.  Some make  <br/>\nsomething up for it and skip it. Some just skip it.   But I think, at  <br/>\nthat moment, that the person was not &quot;reading&quot; but stopping, one way  <br/>\nor another, to use another strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: practicing the piano","postDate":"1183383989","msgId":29722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2YXZqbCt1NGEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUxQTFBODg1LTlCNUEtNDg1My04OUNGLUQzQ0U1NTVFQ0RGREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29695,"nextInTopic":29724,"prevInTime":29721,"nextInTime":29723,"topicId":29570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... my ...

She goes once a week, for a 30 minute<br/>\nlesson.  She is 8.

And<br/>\nsometimes she says she doesn&#39;t want to go to her lesson.<br/>\nSo we&#39;ll take some time off.  I just call & cancel some lessons - maybe 2<br/>\nweeks, maybe 4.

It was ideal for us and our life. She wanted to continue<br/>\nsinging, so we hooked up with a Girls Chorale. They met over 9 months, once<br/>\nweekly for a very intense rehearsal. Hannah&#39;s love of the piano was sparked<br/>\nhere. We didn&#39;t do lessons, we fingered and figured out the songs she liked<br/>\nand we picked up fun-looking books. She didn&#39;t want to rehearse at home for<br/>\nthe Chorale; sometimes she didn&#39;t want to go to group rehearsals. When she<br/>\ndid participate, she loved it and it did spark something in *her* to want to<br/>\nreturn. She loved the retreat they had with a local opera singer. She loved<br/>\nplaying the songs on the piano. She loved singing the songs. Not the same<br/>\nexperience other girls got from the groups. Definitely a Hannah experience.<br/>\nA joyful one at that.<br/>\nI know the expectations of the other grownups for the other kids were<br/>\ndifferent than mine. We met the core criteria and did the rest Hannah&#39;s way.<br/>\nI smiled at a lot of &quot;clucking&quot; mothers. My kid was always happy to be<br/>\nthere. We were participating on a scholarship, which could make one feel<br/>\neven *more* obligated to fully participate, so as to better appreciate the<br/>\ngift or somesuch ;) I worked my way through. This gift is a gift of Joy. If<br/>\nSinging is bringing Joy, then the scholarship has done it&#39;s job. To provide<br/>\nSinging without the Joy by making it full of have-tos and musts, cannot be<br/>\nthe goal here... what&#39;d be left to sing about? I found a way to best<br/>\nappreciate all the gifts in the scenario, first being the gift of my<br/>\ndaughter and her love of music.
