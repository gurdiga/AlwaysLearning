That&#39;s the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nA recipe exchange would take up too much list time and be boring to  <br/>\nmost people and unschoolers don&#39;t necessarily have any better recipes  <br/>\nthan anybody else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ideas for how to be more flexible in meeting our kids needs -  <br/>\nthat is appropriate here, for sure.<br/>\nAlso, thinking about what we really want is good - for example, I  <br/>\ndecided from early on, when my girls were little, that it was more  <br/>\nimportant that they not develop eating disorders than anything else  <br/>\nto do with food. I saw moms constantly nagging at their kids about  <br/>\nwhat they ate or didn&#39;t eat and I could see how that focus on food  <br/>\nwas, eventually, likely to backfire. The moms just wanted their kids  <br/>\nto eat healthy foods - I understood that. But even at very young  <br/>\nages, it was clear that food was becoming part of a power/control/ <br/>\nresistance dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is likely to walk into our house after work and find it in  <br/>\na whirlwind of activity - people getting ready to go, just arriving  <br/>\nhome,  etc. Theater rehearsals tend to start at 7 pm - there is  <br/>\nkarate class, or soccer practice, or a Girl Scout event. He&#39;s usually  <br/>\nhungry - so he digs around for leftovers right away, if nobody has  <br/>\nany actual dinner going.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Sunday evenings we all tend to be home - often with an extra kid  <br/>\nor two. So, either we go out to eat or we get take-out - or if  <br/>\nsomeone isn&#39;t busy during the afternoon, they make a nice dinner.  <br/>\nDuring the summer that&#39;s usually barbeque night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI buy a lot of frozen foods at either Trader Joe&#39;s or Costco.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe eat a lot of fast food, too. BUT - not all fast food is created  <br/>\nequal. In spite of the supposed &quot;evidence&quot; of the movie, &quot;Super Size  <br/>\nMe,&quot; I eat healthy foods at fast food places all the time. Grilled  <br/>\nchicken places like El Pollo Loco or Charo Chicken are great. I order  <br/>\nhamburgers with just ketchup and with extra tomatoes and lettuce - no  <br/>\nmayonnaise and no cheese, I eat only a few french fries, almost never  <br/>\na whole order, much less a supersized order. I eat at places that  <br/>\nhave side salads as an option to fries, I eat the baked potatoes at  <br/>\nWendy&#39;s. So - in spite of eating fast food nearly every day of my  <br/>\nlife for many years - I just got my physical exam results back (ON my  <br/>\nbirthday, how is that for timing? &lt;G&gt;) and all the lab tests are in  <br/>\nthe &quot;excellent&quot; range. Lots of this is lucky genetics, of course. My  <br/>\nkids will eat like me, for the most part, although more fries and  <br/>\noften a milk shake. But they get way more activity than I do, so they  <br/>\nneed those extra calories.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do keep good fruits and veggies in the refrigerator and on the  <br/>\ndining room table, most of the time. And I spend money on them -  <br/>\ndon&#39;t buy the cheapest bland-tasting apples, but the best ones, and a  <br/>\nwide variety. That&#39;s money well spent. I buy in season stuff that is  <br/>\nripe - especially things that are grown near us like tomatoes and  <br/>\nstrawberries. I know people who buy a bag of fruit without even  <br/>\ncaring if it is tasty or not - they put it out and tell the kids they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t have other stuff (cupcakes, cookies, candy, chips), that they  <br/>\nhave to have fruit for a snack. Yuck. If pears are good, I buy more  <br/>\npears and slice them up and offer them around to whomever is home. I  <br/>\nbought a half-flat of strawberries because they were SO good, the  <br/>\nother day. I buy frozen fruit medleys from Costco, too. Some  <br/>\npartially defrosted frozen fruits with whipped cream on top is a  <br/>\ndelicious special treat. I also boil sugar and lemon juice to make a  <br/>\nsweet/tart syrup and sometimes put that over mostly-defrosted frozen  <br/>\nfruit. Sometimes with a little rose water added (that&#39;s an Iranian  <br/>\nthing - we love it - not everybody thinks rose water tastes like  <br/>\nsomething that should be ingested &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t usually think of us as doing a great job handing food needs -  <br/>\nI have a crummy teensy little kitchen, I&#39;m a perfectly good cook, but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t personally get a lot of satisfaction from the cooking itself  <br/>\nand there are many other things I&#39;d rather be doing. But we&#39;re all  <br/>\nhealthy and I have three teenage girls who aren&#39;t anorexic or bulimic  <br/>\nand they enjoy good food and understand nutritional needs and eat a  <br/>\nwide variety of foods without any apparent &quot;issues.&quot; That&#39;s good. If  <br/>\nI had a cook, we&#39;d eat better - but we don&#39;t employ a cook and I have  <br/>\nother things to do. Choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting how they&#39;ve each found their own way of getting a  <br/>\nlot of physical activity, too. Rosie plays soccer and does karate,  <br/>\nRoxana dances - tap and ballet and musical theater movement, Roya  <br/>\ngoes to a gym almost every day and finds another fun activity to do  <br/>\nonce or twice a week - a game of tennis, a bike ride, a hike,  <br/>\nsnowboarding - she&#39;s into trying new things. Rosie has always been  <br/>\nactive - she&#39;d go out and ride her bike for hours, if she didn&#39;t have  <br/>\nany other physical activity that day. But the other two have had LONG  <br/>\nperiods of very sedentary lifestyles. Now, at 15, 18, and 21 - they  <br/>\nare very healthy and physically active.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 27, 2006, at 12:33 PM, cathyandgarth wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I must admit that with unschooling it is hard to seperate out<br/>\n&gt; the various parts of life, and distinguish which are only<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and which are something else, since it all seems like<br/>\n&gt; one and the same at my stage in the game.

People need to be  <br/>\nnourished physically and it&#39;s uncomfortable to go to sleep hungry.   <br/>\nTHAT is the purpose of evening food, not the appearance of a well- <br/>\norganized dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistorically, until pretty recently the only families in the English- <br/>\nspeaking-world-in-general that had that dream dinner were those with  <br/>\nservants to cook and set the table.  All the family had to do was  <br/>\nshow up and eat.  Poorer families tended to have soup or stew that  <br/>\nhad cooked all day and eat it out of bowls.  Crock pot food, and  <br/>\nprobably NOT meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nServants became scarce during and after the first world war and the  <br/>\ngreat depression  but the expectation that families would still  <br/>\nmaintain those appearances and schedules continued, or some families  <br/>\ntried to use their children as servants.  Most mothers just tried to  <br/>\ndo all the cooking and ironing that they used to have done by maids,  <br/>\nwhen the families couldn&#39;t afford to pay someone at least to come in  <br/>\nand do laundry and ironing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it&#39;s not uncommon (historically) for children to eat first, and  <br/>\nseparately, and food kids like, and then for the adults and teens and  <br/>\nguests to eat a little later, at leisure, and not have to worry about  <br/>\nwhether their food is something the kids would like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more energy in the morning but I don&#39;t always want to use it  <br/>\nthinking about dinner.  When I do, I do better. &lt;g&gt;  If I start bread  <br/>\nand put something out to thaw, or better yet mix up a casserole or  <br/>\nput something in the crock pot—at least a sauce or something easy  <br/>\nlike ground beef or chicken in barbecue sauce—then dinner is easy and  <br/>\nif plans change, the thing that was started earlier can go in the  <br/>\nfridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because Keith takes lunch to work, we make large amounts and  <br/>\nput the planned-for leftovers into individual portions in those  <br/>\nreuseable yet eventually disposable Zip-Loc plastic containers.

If you&#39;re in MD, dinner&#39;s at 6:30! :-)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope that helps!!<br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
