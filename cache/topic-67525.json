Some kids learn by such a subtle, understated process that it seems nearly magical: poof! they can read! And sometimes learning to read seems more like a side-effect of something else - playing video games is a good example. Kids are interested in the information they get through print, but not necessarily interested in &quot;exploring reading&quot; per se. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of that, sometimes kids want to read before they&#39;re ready. Educators tend to spread the idea that interest in reading is a sign of &quot;reading readiness&quot; but that&#39;s an artifact of school - since teachers know kids don&#39;t learn nearly as well when they aren&#39;t interested, they look for ways to create and exploit interests whenever they can. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; If you are reading to your child the things she enjoys and wants to hear...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which may not be stories! Sometimes parents get the idea that kids should want to read lots and lots of stories, and while that&#39;s true of many kids, it isn&#39;t true of all children. Some kids want to know what instructions and signs say, but aren&#39;t really interested in stories - Mo wasn&#39;t, when she was little, but learned to read just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240358028,"authorName":"kristi_beguin","from":"&quot;kristi_beguin&quot; &lt;foehn_jye@...&gt;","profile":"kristi_beguin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Reading when ready!","postDate":"1339528757","msgId":67618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpyODRubCtnaHIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRFJoMGU4TFZKT29EQVBOQ3AtZXlvaG92a2UtYXVPK2IwdDk1NHFDZ1pGcUFYZ1U2Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67617,"nextInTopic":67619,"prevInTime":67617,"nextInTime":67619,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 9-year old daughter recently started reading chapter books.

The other day, during a moment of quiet and in between play bursts, she wondered aloud whether she could read a chapter book.  I said, &quot;go for it.&quot;  She read the book in two days, and then pulled out the big stack she&#39;d inherited from her cousins.  While on vacation this past weekend, she had a lot of fun scouring for new books in a bookstore.  I think the most poignant thing for both of us was the simplicity with which it happened.

In some cases, trying to teach kids to read can actually prevent them from learning to read. In any case, schools define &quot;reading&quot; differently for children than for adults - kids in school are expected to &quot;read&quot; at a year or two behind their ability to comprehend spoken language, with a fairly minimal level of comprehension, the level you&#39;d get skimming something, or reading something in a foreign language you kinda-sorta understand. But the real level of understanding is eclipsed by quizzes and &quot;skill building&quot; exercises and the fact that kids who learn to read on their own dominate the class and the others learn dozens of tricks to keep their heads down. <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple good books describing how reading happens without kids being taught are Literacy Through Play, and Much More than just the ABCs. They study kids in open classrooms, rather than homeschoolers, but that can make the information more useful for people who have a lot of baggage in education. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I have been feeling concerned about this &#39;issue&#39; of reading for some time - and even more so as she is 7 now and not showing much interest or ability. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are theories of education which recommend that reading not be taught before age 7 or 8 because the majority of children aren&#39;t ready to read before 7. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids who read without being taught seem to fall into three general groups in terms of when they&#39;re ready.

If that&#39;s not developed, decoding won&#39;t be useful without comprehension. It isn&#39;t early reading that is critical; it is early experiences that allow the child to develop so that she&#39;s ready to read later. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren born into today&#39;s unschooling families have different experiences than children of your mother&#39;s youth. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child decides she wants to read, that spark of desire drives the exploration process within the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are reading to your child the things she enjoys and wants to hear, she will be gaining language skills and knowledge and be exposed to new ideas that she would if she were reading it herself. There is no loss in that, and it enables her to hear things beyond what might be her reading ability. We didn&#39;t stop reading to our children. My daughter came home from college and her dad read to her for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew a boy who asked his mom when he was going to read because he was 8 and his friends had been reading for some time. His mom told him he would read when he was ready. He wondered when he would be ready, and he looked out the car window at the road signs as they passed and began reading them. He was delighted and said he was ready!<br/>\n<br/>\nRah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cat@...\">cat@...</a><br/>\nDate: Tue, 12 Jun 2012 22:37:44 +1000<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Reading when ready!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to write this evening to ask for some help about . . . reading!  And I found this thread - I hope I am not hijacking the OP but hope it might extend the thread with further clarifications for me and others.  Perhaps I should rename it - perhaps someone with more experience in the list can do that if they think it is required?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am staying at with my parents - this only happens 2 or 3 times a year as we are at opposite ends of the country.  My mum has been an &#39;early childhood educator&#39; since she went to teachers college at 16 and she worked as an infants teacher ever since except for a few years when we were little - she eventually became a primary school principal - a lifetime career she is very proud of.  She is 75 now and has been very concerned about our choices to homeschool and especially not using a curriculum/(standard)lessons/approaches.  Both my brothers and one of their wives are also teachers . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis evening after I had been reading The Enchanted Wood to our daughter before she went to sleep, my mum said that when I was 7 I was reading that book to myself and that they did not need to read to me because I was reading everything I &#39;could get my hands on&#39; and &#39;of course Maya would be too&#39; IF (now I am paraphrasing) she had the tools because &#39;you can&#39;t tell a child to go and build a garden if they don&#39;t have the tools for it and of course Maya does not have those tools and Patrick (another grandchild) was also reading Harry Potter at 7 and Maya clearly has no tools because she can&#39;t even recognise simple words like &#39;the&#39; etc&#39;.  I said a couple of things to support our approach while my dad looked at the carpet & my mum continued to dispute it and all I came away with was a terrible feeling of letting my daughter down and wondering why she didn&#39;t want/learn to read already and whether or not I am doing any of the right things to support this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling concerned about this &#39;issue&#39; of reading for some time - and even more so as she is 7 now and not showing much interest or ability.  I am bouyed up by a line from The Big Book Of Unschooling - &#39;don&#39;t deprive your children of the experience of them learning to read by themselves&#39;  but somehow this does not hold up against the doubts that pile up about whether or not I am doing the right thing by her and whether I should/could do more.  Basically, my experience is that she doesn&#39;t want to be approached in any way that feels (to her) like being &#39;taught&#39; to read - too much sounding out or asking questions or explaining sounds/words and she says &#39;come on mum, just read&#39;.  So I&#39;m not sure if I could find more fun ways to do this kind of &#39;tool giving&#39; but that feels forced to me and I don&#39;t know how parents and teachers manage to solicit this kind of cooperation.  I have no doubt that Maya would respond to school type teaching situations - she is more than happy to do as she&#39;s asked/told at ballet and violin (so far! - she has begun both this year - a term of the former and 3 classes of the latter) but she does not want that from me, and certainly not in relation to reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, inspite of having read a lot about reading, I am still full of doubt.  I am concerned that I am letting her down. I am concerned about what kind of options I am providing for her by not having settled her into the pathways of early reading.  I am concerned that she is not going to learn to read well or properly or understand language and writing in a way that will enable her access into future options. As you can see from my background I come from a very &#39;schooled&#39; family and I was a top 5% kind of student and an English literature major etc so perhaps I am having trouble deschooling around this area . . . I just wonder if I have let her down.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to find a way to feel more confident about our approach - sometimes it seems so very radical and unproven and I am in a wilderness with no real examples of people learning in this way.  Of course I can see all kinds of learning taking place for her and she has compiled her own yoga routine (for example) which she voluntarily executes on many mornings - so clearly she can put things together by herself based on her observations.  But still I am so full of doubt.  Especially when faced by people who are so confident about their own schooled approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I met a woman whose homeschooled daughters follow an American homeschool curriculum program (we are in Australia) and the 12 year old is up till 10 every night to finish assignments/lessons.  And even though I think this is crazy I am still left with doubts that I am letting my daughter down because she will not have the opportunities available to her that are available to schooled children.  And if I am closing the door to those opportunities, then what opportunities am I providing her with?  Can they be named?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired by this doubt but cannot seem to let go.  Will my daughter be 17 and I am still full of doubt?  What a shame that would be.  But what if I am not actually providing my daughter with everything she needs in the midst of our lives . . . juggling a smaller child, and running the house, supporting the family income etc.  How can I know if what I do is enough? or if they are the right things?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSO yes, I really am feeling stuck here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwith thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nCatherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266230379,"authorName":"Aisha Alkhani","from":"Aisha Alkhani &lt;alwaysaisha@...&gt;","profile":"alkhani_tribe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Reading when ready!","postDate":"1339517745","msgId":67616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRFJoMGU4SndaOWJMV3ZwQ2o2OUJfQVNoaXBOdjkxSy0tamozYmI1VWU3UTNQQXM1QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEZBMUJFN0VDLUNDRjItNDgxOS04NUY3LTVFRTA2RUIxRUQyMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDY3MkJEQTc0LTczQkMtNDNGMS1CMkYwLUZBNkNFNjU3OTlFNEBjdWx0dXJlbGFiLm9yZy5hdT4JPEZBMUJFN0VDLUNDRjItNDgxOS04NUY3LTVFRTA2RUIxRUQyMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":67615,"nextInTopic":67617,"prevInTime":67615,"nextInTime":67617,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So today I am sending a round of applause and thank you to both Catherine and Joyce!

And the kids who couldn&#39;t walk at 14 months would seem defective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat reading instruction is supposedly necessary and works is a huge mental block that it&#39;s hard to see around because nearly everyone believes it&#39;s true. And, more importantly, *no teachers have experience with kids who have learned without instruction.* (Except for those freaky 4 yos who sometimes spontaneously read.

Without a control group who aren&#39;t being instructed in reading, there&#39;s no way for teachers to know what happens when kids aren&#39;t instructed. All kids are instructed so teachers are positive it&#39;s necessary. *But teachers don&#39;t know.*<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly unschoolers know the truth. We&#39;re the control group. *All* of our kids read and read just fine. Because our kids read when they&#39;re developmentally ready, because they read what they find meaningful for them, because they read for their own information not to answer someone else&#39;s pretend questions, they read just fine and without the trauma of feeling stupid and with the dislike of reading that can result from the pressure of instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know how to find a way to feel more confident about our approach - <br/>\n&gt; sometimes it seems so very radical and unproven and I am in a wilderness <br/>\n&gt; with no real examples of people learning in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Back in the 60s it was a wilderness.

And I found this thread - I hope I am not hijacking the OP but hope it might extend the thread with further clarifications for me and others.  Perhaps I should rename it - perhaps someone with more experience in the list can do that if they think it is required?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am staying at with my parents - this only happens 2 or 3 times a year as we are at opposite ends of the country.  My mum has been an &#39;early childhood educator&#39; since she went to teachers college at 16 and she worked as an infants teacher ever since except for a few years when we were little - she eventually became a primary school principal - a lifetime career she is very proud of.  She is 75 now and has been very concerned about our choices to homeschool and especially not using a curriculum/(standard)lessons/approaches.  Both my brothers and one of their wives are also teachers . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nThis evening after I had been reading The Enchanted Wood to our daughter before she went to sleep, my mum said that when I was 7 I was reading that book to myself and that they did not need to read to me because I was reading everything I &#39;could get my hands on&#39; and &#39;of course Maya would be too&#39; IF (now I am paraphrasing) she had the tools because &#39;you can&#39;t tell a child to go and build a garden if they don&#39;t have the tools for it and of course Maya does not have those tools and Patrick (another grandchild) was also reading Harry Potter at 7 and Maya clearly has no tools because she can&#39;t even recognise simple words like &#39;the&#39; etc&#39;.  I said a couple of things to support our approach while my dad looked at the carpet & my mum continued to dispute it and all I came away with was a terrible feeling of letting my daughter down and wondering why she didn&#39;t want/learn to read already and whether or not I am doing any of the right things to support this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling concerned about this &#39;issue&#39; of reading for some time - and even more so as she is 7 now and not showing much interest or ability.  I am bouyed up by a line from The Big Book Of Unschooling - &#39;don&#39;t deprive your children of the experience of them learning to read by themselves&#39;  but somehow this does not hold up against the doubts that pile up about whether or not I am doing the right thing by her and whether I should/could do more.  Basically, my experience is that she doesn&#39;t want to be approached in any way that feels (to her) like being &#39;taught&#39; to read - too much sounding out or asking questions or explaining sounds/words and she says &#39;come on mum, just read&#39;.  So I&#39;m not sure if I could find more fun ways to do this kind of &#39;tool giving&#39; but that feels forced to me and I don&#39;t know how parents and teachers manage to solicit this kind of cooperation.  I have no doubt that Maya would respond to school type teaching situations - she is more than happy to do as she&#39;s asked/told at ballet and violin (so far! - she has begun both this year - a term of the former and 3 classes of the latter) but she does not want that from me, and certainly not in relation to reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, inspite of having read a lot about reading, I am still full of doubt.  I am concerned that I am letting her down. I am concerned about what kind of options I am providing for her by not having settled her into the pathways of early reading.  I am concerned that she is not going to learn to read well or properly or understand language and writing in a way that will enable her access into future options. As you can see from my background I come from a very &#39;schooled&#39; family and I was a top 5% kind of student and an English literature major etc so perhaps I am having trouble deschooling around this area . . . I just wonder if I have let her down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to find a way to feel more confident about our approach - sometimes it seems so very radical and unproven and I am in a wilderness with no real examples of people learning in this way.  Of course I can see all kinds of learning taking place for her and she has compiled her own yoga routine (for example) which she voluntarily executes on many mornings - so clearly she can put things together by herself based on her observations.  But still I am so full of doubt.  Especially when faced by people who are so confident about their own schooled approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I met a woman whose homeschooled daughters follow an American homeschool curriculum program (we are in Australia) and the 12 year old is up till 10 every night to finish assignments/lessons.  And even though I think this is crazy I am still left with doubts that I am letting my daughter down because she will not have the opportunities available to her that are available to schooled children.  And if I am closing the door to those opportunities, then what opportunities am I providing her with?  Can they be named?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired by this doubt but cannot seem to let go.  Will my daughter be 17 and I am still full of doubt?  What a shame that would be.  But what if I am not actually providing my daughter with everything she needs in the midst of our lives . . . juggling a smaller child, and running the house, supporting the family income etc.  How can I know if what I do is enough? or if they are the right things?<br/>\n<br/>\nSO yes, I really am feeling stuck here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nwith thanks<br/>\nCatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reading when ready!","postDate":"1339399440","msgId":67596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4QURGQTZELUEwQjMtNDcxQi1CNEU1LTEwMzg5NkU1QTE4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzkzNzA2MTQuNDUxNy5ZYWhvb01haWxDbGFzc2ljQHdlYjEyMTcwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzkzNzA2MTQuNDUxNy5ZYWhvb01haWxDbGFzc2ljQHdlYjEyMTcwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67591,"nextInTopic":67614,"prevInTime":67595,"nextInTime":67597,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=My older son was in public school for many years, and all his friends are there.

Support what they love rather than using their interests to get what you want for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you were interested in Italian cooking?

You&#39;re looking at how to get what you want into them. Look at them and help them get what they&#39;re reaching for. If reading is truly useful they can&#39;t explore what interests them without bumping into it in ways that are meaningful to them. They will extract information from the written word because they need it as they&#39;re brains are developing. They&#39;ll memorize EXIT and SAVE and McDonalds.

She asks my sons &quot;what are you doing for schoolwork now?&quot; My youngest, who was never at school, always has sort of a blank look at the question. I translate &quot;She might like to hear about what we just finished reading, or the museum we went to last week or the snake show we saw&quot;. In her case, she KNOWS what the public schools were like 30 years ago, and knows they are &quot;worse&quot; (her word) now. She is supportive, she just would not get the concept of unschooling and her questions reflect that. It isn&#39;t too hard for us, because we don&#39;t see her often, and she just wants to hear the news and feel connected. She isn&#39;t sabotaging, like it sounds like your m-i-l is. I  just explain that we follow their interests and do lots of cool stuff, and she loves to hear about it so she can mull it over later in all her alone time (which for her is most of it). <br/>\nThere are folks that do seem to sabotage, though. My older son was in public school for many years, and all his friends are there. He still goes in for band and art (his choice). His girlfriend and friends would quiz him and make him feel badly sometimes. I remind him that he shouldn&#39;t be comparing himself. He decides what he wants to learn, what he thinks is interesting or important. I do think he&#39;s never totally embraced the unschooling world because of that foot in the school world.

If she believes she&#39;ll learn to read from it, not fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading ability comes from the brain being developmentally ready to read. And the only way to get there is by waiting. A brain can&#39;t read before it&#39;s ready any more than legs can walk before they&#39;re ready. A reading program will be just as frustrating and useless to a non-reader as walking programs to a non-walker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds wrong because schools falsely operate under the assumption that reading is purely mechanical. By applying all these mechanical reading processes to kids, most of the kids eventually read. So it *seems* like the processes worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the kids have also grown older in that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would only be a wild theory that time was important in learning to read if there weren&#39;t 1000s of unschooled kids who&#39;ve learned to read without the mechanics of instruction. What they have is time and positive and useful-to-them experiences with print. They all learn to read. And without the bad side effects of force-fed reading instruction that leaves many kids feeling stupid and hating reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Not all unschooled kids love to read just as not all unschooled kids love to ride bikes. But their opinions about reading are personal preferences not because of bad experiences with reading instruction.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: motivating my daughter!","postDate":"1339154745","msgId":67558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGNTE5RUQ1LTczREYtNDkxQy05MTdDLTk0QTA4REUwN0U0MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxc2ttMStzdWc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxc2ttMStzdWc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67557,"nextInTopic":67560,"prevInTime":67557,"nextInTime":67559,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/books has four books.

So, i&#39;ve order some illustrated history books (i like Usborne) and started planning a project BUT now I&#39;ve read about strewing and strings attached, I&#39;m thinking planning a project is not the thing to do.

It doesn&#39;t need to be measured into years or even centuries.  Just relative.  &quot;Which one came first?&quot; was her question.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy wait for books while you&#39;re sitting at a computer writing to us?   Google it!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf taping things on the wall disturbs you, what about cards to lay out on the table in the order in which they go?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: motivating my daughter!","postDate":"1339089318","msgId":67528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOMzBRRj14a0hPMU12QXc5QTktS3ZZeDY2eWI0UEp4c1ZvU09mc3BPeXlkZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQMk55MlNpaFhUeS05MGpWPUc0WWN3Y1BSOTUtZ1Q9UmNjNExZLWZMZS1uZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpxcWowNCtuazM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Q0FPT1RhWFAyTnkyU2loWFR5LTkwalY9RzRZY3djUFI5NS1nVD1SY2M0TFktZkxlLW5nQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67527,"nextInTopic":67530,"prevInTime":67527,"nextInTime":67529,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Be sympathetic and<br/>\ncomforting and reassuring. Don&#39;t let her wallow in it by being SO<br/>\nsympathetic that you make it worse. Sometimes it helps to simply be<br/>\ndistracting. Help her when she wants help, but be careful not to act<br/>\nanxious or worried, yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nProtect her from potentially embarrassing moments by thinking ahead. If she<br/>\njoins Girl Guides, for example, talk to the leader about whether she often<br/>\nasks the girls to read aloud - let her know that would embarrass your<br/>\ndaughter and you&#39;d appreciate if she&#39;d give you advance warning so she<br/>\ncould practice the reading first.

If you&#39;re the<br/>\nleader, you&#39;ll have control over how any &quot;reading&quot; at meetings or events is<br/>\nhandled.

I have a<br/>\n24-year old daughter who is studying history in college - she&#39;s just<br/>\nstarting graduate school. As a kid, she always loved history. So I have a<br/>\nlot of experience with supporting that particular interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you live in a place where you have access to cool museums? Get<br/>\nmemberships so you can go frequently for short visits. Go to science, art,<br/>\nnatural history, technology, and all kinds of specialty museums. We have<br/>\n(in Los Angeles near where I live) an automotive museum that is<br/>\nsurprisingly extraordinarily fascinating and fun and all about the modern<br/>\nhistory of the world seen through the lens of the development of cars.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you live in a place where there are lots of historical sites -<br/>\nvisit those as often as possible, again, even just for short stops (in<br/>\nother words, these can become part of daily life, not big special<br/>\noccasions). When you go anywhere, check for historically interesting things<br/>\n- always google and find out any interesting things about that place. A<br/>\nzillion times I have driven a little out of our way just to be at a<br/>\nlocation where I could say, &quot;This is where X happened.&quot; That&#39;s it. Maybe<br/>\nthat would lead to a big conversation or not. Stop at graveyards and wander<br/>\naround. Go into churches. Notice old architectural styles - point out older<br/>\nbuildings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose sone collected &quot;National Historical Landmarks.&quot; In<br/>\nthe US, these are sites officially designated by the National Park Service.<br/>\nOften there is just a plaque there - sometimes a statue - sometimes a<br/>\nstructure and sometimes an actual restoration of a site. This boy had a<br/>\njournal in which he kept a photo and note about each historical site they<br/>\nwent to. The sites are all over - sometimes just off the side of a major<br/>\nhighway or down a little backstreet alley. We traveled sometimes with them<br/>\nand we&#39;d often go searching for one of the sites - it led us to some<br/>\ninteresting and unexpected places.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play games - there are games that have been around<br/>\nforever...backgammon, chess, card games. You might read, yourself, a bit<br/>\nabout the history of those games and then just mention it when you happen<br/>\nto be playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoose movies and tv shows that are historically based.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to re-enactment events and festivals. Go in costume. Spend time making<br/>\nthose costumes in advance. My kids spent a lot of their childhoods in<br/>\ncostumes - depending on their interests at the time. They spent time<br/>\nlooking at pictures of people of the time/place of interest in order to<br/>\nfigure out what to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to cultural events - we have Scottish games and Irish dance and Persian<br/>\nnew year and Chinese new year and so on - all of those have public<br/>\ncelebrations with food, dance, costumes, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night, for dinner, together plan and make food that would have been<br/>\ntypical for some time period/location. American homeschoolers are fond of<br/>\nthe &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; book series and there is a cookbook to go<br/>\nalong with it and my kids occasionally would want to make something from<br/>\nthat cookbook while dressed up in bonnets and long dresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a book series that I&#39;d recommend because it is SO fun....it is the<br/>\nseries called: Horrible Histories by Terry Deary. Google it. They currently<br/>\nhave a tv series, too, it is a BBC production, I believe, and I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nif it is available outside of England.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - so that&#39;s a taste of how I supported my daughter&#39;s interests in<br/>\nhistorical stuff - and it is just a taste. BUT - at the same time - I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t bombard her and overwhelm her with it - I just had all these sort of<br/>\nat my fingertips ready to offer or to slip in throughout our days and weeks<br/>\nas we did all kinds of other things, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: motivating my daughter!","postDate":"1339086531","msgId":67526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPXzB3cW83OVBuVW1ESDI0QWpFM015QllQM2FqMEZmcmk3R2JfSnVVR0t4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxcWowNCtuazM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxcWowNCtuazM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67525,"nextInTopic":67527,"prevInTime":67525,"nextInTime":67527,"topicId":67525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
