My schools name: Juan de Onate Elementary. Our mascot: The Conquistadors. In 4th grade we learned state history just like all the schools in California. What history is that? Missions. Spanish history. The history of who “found” this land and conquered it.<br/>\n____end quote_____<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Mexico has state history in 7th grade, and it NOT “missions. Spanish history.”  There is some, but not most.  <br/>\nThat school wasn’t 99% native, unless she was including Hispanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to the counting, I know about that because of having taught.  I don’t know verthing, but I know a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid, my dad worked on Indian land (land leased from Pojoaque Pueblo).  That made me more valuable to the school district, somehow.   Kids who had a parent working for Los Alamost National Laboratories “counted” too.  It must have been some extra federal funding, in the 1950s and 60’s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching, in he 1970s, that wasn’t one of the questions.  Each year, though, teachers gathered stats on kids.  I had a class of 9th graders one year that was particularly mixed, and so in a joking way, we added it up as halves.  If three kids were half anglo (a term that will eventually fade away, but was still in full use then), we called that 1.5 anglo kids.  Some were half Indian, half Hispanic.  Several were half Hispanic and half anglo, so we added it up, made whole numbers again, and there were a couple of .5s.      <br/>\n<br/>\nThe report was carried to the office, and I was not surprised that an assistant principal brought it right back saying, “You can’t do it this way.”<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that, but we had had fun, and a point was being made.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of various cash streams I didn’t ask about and still don’t care about, there is money that schools can get.  Federal funding.  Hispanic enrollment (used to be called “Spanish surname,” when I was little, but even then that wasn’t catching enough kids, and intermarriage blossomed from he 1970’s on).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here’s how kisd in public schools are counted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf Indian=Indian.<br/>\nOne quarter Indian=Indian.<br/>\nHalf Hispanic=Hispanic (if the other half isn’t Indian; see above)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of those halves that were anglo?  That’s some erasure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA school can have kids with VERY non-local names, parents who are clearly not at all Hispanic or Indian, but their kids are (statistically, financially).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even the stats from the now-defunct Juan de Oñate Elementary could easily incorporate lots of kids who are half or quarter Indian, and half Hispanic, with lots of halves of Anglo kids Not-Appearing-in-these-Stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister has three kids (grown) named Trujillo.<br/>\nThe oldest has a partner named Gonzales.    (Lesbian couple, no kids)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne married another Trujillo (no relation) and they have one child.  He’s 1/4 Anglo, but no one will ever care, ever again.  It’s obscure trivia now. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy anglo cousin has five separately-and-otherwise unrelated Trujillo children, four of whom reproduced. Mostly Trujillos, but no non-Hispanic surnames.  Their anglo ancestry is erased.  And it shouldn’t be a big deal, one way or the other, except for the money schools can get and the diversity points they can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in school and when I taught, both, the stats in our district were about 70% Hispanic, 15% Indian, 15% Anglo (which usd to include the occasional Black family).  Anglo was used like the Amish use “the English.”  It’s about people whose grandparents spoke English, and not Spanish or Tewa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love New Mexico.  There are oddities, and it’s nice to be back stage in so many way. I’ve been here nearly sixty years.  I don’t like people misrepresenting New Mexico.  <br/>\nI’m not wild about people misrepresenting me, either. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Neural Pathways","postDate":"1549950315","msgId":78562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2OTU1QjQ4LUFFQTAtNEYxNS04MzQwLTVBRDBFNkZCRUVERkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCNTZDRkMyLTVGRkQtNDE3RS1CRjE2LTEwREUxRkNDRDZEQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJDNUY2MzRFLTY0NzUtNDkxNi05NkJDLTQ2MDYzNEUzNUJFNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBRkZuREs3ajRZK1NUa0tWN293c0E3Nz1ZdnhPR0VFNlpjeVMtWVZ4WlJfVGNCVGtHQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEI1M0Y3QjlFLTFFN0ItNDcyNS1CQUMwLTE0QjhBQUFGQUZGOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDRCNTZDRkMyLTVGRkQtNDE3RS1CRjE2LTEwREUxRkNDRDZEQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78561,"nextInTopic":78564,"prevInTime":78561,"nextInTime":78563,"topicId":78555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OOOPS!  #2 was under open windows…..

Pueblos, especially, have secrets and they want to have secrets.  There are things it’s just not polite to even ask.  Don’t ask.<br/>\nPueblo kids are not forthcoming if other Pueblo kids are present.  One kid, alone, will talk and laugh and be fine (unless it’s an introverted kid, I mean), but if there are two who don’t know each other well, or if there are three or more—and if you’re the teacher, or dealing with them somehow—don’t ask one to “perform” or even to answer a question, because it’s not nice for one to embarrass another. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s something I figured out, mostly, but when teachers would come from out of state, I would warn them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, once I was at a clinic, and as the Pueblo mom ahead of me was leaving with her coral-bracelet-wearing baby, the nurse practitioner spoke up cheerily, “She’s just Perfect!”  And the mom stiffened a bit as she was walking by, and kept walking.  It was my turn, and I went in and said “Don’t say a baby is perfect, especially if it’s wearing a coral bracelet or necklace.  That’s there to prevent the evil eye.”  Then I said I was next and introduced myself. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that belief is fading.  It’s among older Hispanic families, too.  It’s a local thing, not a native thing, I think, maybe.  It’s not a thing to ask about. :-)<br/>\nBut instead of saying “Perfect!” (if you end up in such a place and situation), make an exception.  Looks good!  We need to watch that rash, or I hope the cough goes away, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned that from watching, overhearing, caring about local “cures” and concerns, in passing, and by being interested in folklore and cross-overs in situations like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that is NOT a local, traditional thing here is unschooling.  Not even nearly. <br/>\n<br/>\nNavajos are really nice to their kids in public.  It might be they’re nice at home, too.  I don’t know.  I haven’t had a need to know, and they  might rightly figure it’s none of my business. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This situation with Sandra needs to be addressed.  I am now learning that more natives with online presence are making their movement to the homeschooling world to find their way back to their roots.  Please help us protect our friends from having to learn from their own beliefs from someone who has colonized and profited from them.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the HELL!?  <br/>\nIf they are “making their movement to the homeschooling world to find their way back to thir roots,” they’re lost.<br/>\nThey need this person to “protect them” from learning something I didn’t gt from them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this “profited” and “prospered”?  Is this person imagnining and claiming that I’m making a living from this?  The few times I’ve been paid to speak, that’s gone toward meals, gifts for kids who didn’t get to go, and as years passed and my kids were teens and grown, I spent money on travel.   When I’ve crossed any ocean, it has been my own money (family money, my husband’s money).  I’ve never in one year made enough to pay for  a round trip flight out of the country except maybe the year The Big Book of Unschooling was new.  Even then, though, there were expenses to balance that little whoosh of money out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate the help, and sometimes I’ve been paid to speak, but usually it has been speaking in exchange for transportation, a place to stay, and some touristing.  Sometimes the place was a hotel, and more often someone’s house.  Sometimes there wasn’t time for touristing.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfit wasn’t my plan or goal.  Breaking even is nice.  <br/>\n“Prospered”?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom work I did, from synthesizing what I knew from having wanted to be a teacher since first grade, and watching what helped, what didn’t, what was fun, what was not fun; from studying psychology and education; from reading lots about language, learning, thought; from teaching, and learning from that; from Adult Children of Alcoholics, and La Leche League, and Growing Without Schooling Magazine, from knowing two unschooling families before I even considered homeschooling at all, and two HOMEschooling families (with homework, and punishments)—taking all that and sharing the good parts, and figuring out how to turn the bad parts and the dangerous things into principles, y’know what I got?   <br/>\n<br/>\nMore work.  Spinning straw into gold, kind of, but then they bring more straw.  (Only my dad didn’t lie about my abilities and Rumplestiltskin didn’t come to take my baby away, so the analogy is really bad. :-)<br/>\nI didn’t mind that work.  I don’t mind it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have met people who are still my friends. I have saved some beautiful writings, and photos, and art, and put it where others can see it.  People who start reading now will read things by moms who haven’t been around for years, now, but who wrote some clear and inspiring things when they were here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ve had some beautiful notes from people who said “You don’t know me, but…” or “I’ve never posted before, but…” and they tell me their lives are sweeter and more peaceful.  There were two today (plus the one in public :-) ).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, everyone who has helped make the discussions more interesting and richer by telling your own success stories, and sharing your own best ideas, and what didn’t work so well.  <br/>\nThank you, those who read quietly and try to guess what your favorite writers will say. :-)  It’s okay for this to be that way for people, too! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who criticize me in the way the person did, about New Mexico, about where my ideas came from, and what I failed to acknowledge, and all—they are pretending to know more about me than they do, and in the example in this post and the two before, TOTALLY bluffing and bullshitting about what IS and WAS.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t live there.  Don’t let them be “your tribe.”  <br/>\n<br/>\nLive with your own family and your other relatives and friends.  Do what works well, if it works and your kids are happy and are learning.  Doesn’t matter what anyone’s ancestors did, or what they would like to imagine their ancestors did.  Live now, today, as well as you can. Don’t feel guilty if you’re not the preferred color of the season.  Don’t let people tell you what you have to do.  Bullies abound these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it’s okay not to defend me.  If they’re that mean to me, they might be awful to you.  Let it slide. I’m okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, and I hope this is the worst that happens to me this month. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Neural Pathways","postDate":"1549928006","msgId":78558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNTZDRkMyLTVGRkQtNDE3RS1CRjE2LTEwREUxRkNDRDZEQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI1M0Y3QjlFLTFFN0ItNDcyNS1CQUMwLTE0QjhBQUFGQUZGOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJDNUY2MzRFLTY0NzUtNDkxNi05NkJDLTQ2MDYzNEUzNUJFNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBRkZuREs3ajRZK1NUa0tWN293c0E3Nz1ZdnhPR0VFNlpjeVMtWVZ4WlJfVGNCVGtHQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEI1M0Y3QjlFLTFFN0ItNDcyNS1CQUMwLTE0QjhBQUFGQUZGOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78557,"nextInTopic":78559,"prevInTime":78557,"nextInTime":78559,"topicId":78555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is Sandra, with #1 of 3 of responses.

Just north of town was San Juan Pueblo (now known as Ohkay Owingeh).  Those kids went to school with us.  There was an elementary school at San Juan Pueblo, but it was regional (part of the public schools). I went there briefly in 2nd grade.  My nieces and nephews went there before they decided to homeschool (and one went back, to play basketball, after a couple of years).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-You cannot live in any city, town or home in New Mexico and not be bombarded with the native life that has been pushed into this small area.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can live right next to a Pueblo or reservation and not be “bombarded” with anything. <br/>\n“…he native life that has been pushed into this small area”?<br/>\nIt’s not a small area, and no one was pushed here.  The pueblos are still right where they were.  The Navajo were herders, taking sheep to different pastures different times of year, and getting to grandma’s house or some sturdy hogan before winter.  They have reservation land that’s theirs now.  I don’t know how the schools are administered.  I never lived near there. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nApaches are linguistically related to Navajos, but a long time ago.  They were nomads and raiders, and there are two reservations—the Jicarilla (sounds like hick - ah - REE- ya because it was spelled in Spanish), in the NW corner of the state (Dulce is their town, and they have their own school district; Bob who was the best man at our wedding, has worked for them for decades).  My sister lived in Chama, the next town over, for the bank for a while, and so she dealt with just about everyone in the tribe, she said, because there were monthly checks deposited in person (it’s probably different now), and everyone in the tribe got a check each month (from the profits from the casino).   I’ve never lived near Apaches, though I’ve hung out with a few.  Bob’s wife is half, but half is “whole” (legally).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith grew up near the Mescalero reservation, but I don’t know whether the kids went to the same schools there. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids, being in the city, and not being in school, didn’t hang out with any Native Americans (a terms used rarely here, and only to talk about the overall generality of all groups).  Kirby had an art teacher who was Navajo when he was little (the two classes I talk about that he took when we saw that he wasn’t ready for kindergarten are that art class and a dance class).  I’ve never said, until now, that one teacher was Navajo and one was Hispanic.  It didn’t matter.  It still doesn’t.   Kirby also, and separately from that, was at a city festival, doing art with some other kids, and one was from one of the western Pueblos and her name was Kirby too!  They were pretty happy about that, because neither of them had met another Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they’ve gotten older, and out, and into jobs, they have worked with Indians, usually from Pueblos around Albuquerque.  The place Kirby is working doing IT has a contract with one of the pueblos, and that might be their biggest client. I think that’s the first time he had been invited to a feast.  (He hasn’t gone yet, but it’s nice that someone asked him.)  I’ve been to feasts in both Santa Clara and (then) San Juan, when I was younger, and later for a wedding, and a funeral.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is too much information, probably.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m still in touch, on facebook, with the grown kids of one of my best high school friends, a singing partner of mine for a while. He no longer living, but his son and I exchange stuff quite a bit, and the daughter occasionally.  I’m peeking in on Jon’s grandkids.  Jon was half Navajo, half Pueblo, but as the pueblo had matrilineal clans, and his mom was Pueblo, he was IN.  His kids, slightly less so socially/cermeonially, maybe (father native; mother anglo), but legally yes, for being half.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn’t learn that by staying in my house.  It doesn’t come of osmosis. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- So the fact that her life in the unschooling world has been so successful is not surprising to me AT ALL. Duh.

We’ve had visitors!  We have visited others.  <br/>\nWas my life successful?  Is my unschooling life successful?  Yes, but because I figured out what might work and did it, and tweaked that, and improved gradually.  I did it pretty much in public, too. :-)<br/>\nPeople asked me to speak at first because they knew and trusted me.  Then I was asked to speak because I was one of the few people who ever HAD spoken about unschooling.  And because I was writing, in pubiic, where people could see it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA tangent, about “unschooling world” up there:  I’ve objected to the term “tribe,” too—many times—bcause I live where there ARE actual legal tribes (Pueblos don’t use the term, and Navajos use “the Navajo Nation” but Apache’s use “tribe.”  And the term “tibal” is used sometimes, of government services or administrative buildings (like “municipal”—as an adjective).  It’s a losing battle, but I have often said “tribe” was irritating, and also people should not try to unschool in groups, but do it individually, and have friendships that weren’t dependent on the families unschooling the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What does surprise me is that she never once attributes the ideas and concepts she has prospered from to the PEOPLE of the area she is from. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool reform info when I was a student at the University of New Mexico was my first intro to The Open Classroom, which is what became unschooling.  My own experiences as a teacher, trying those ideas out, in that same town, between those same Pueblos, with Pueblo kids in my classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt is credited in the intro to this group.  Unschooling was his term.  “Radical unschooling” came from an insult directed at me which I caught and used. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have credited my sources and inspirations tons.  Constantly.   I was confused (still am) about whether it was Lori Odhner or Carol Rice who was speaking when the phrase “be his partner, not his adversary” came out, when they were running a La Leche League meeting together, and Kirby was four months old.  I didn’t know them yet.  It took me a while to tell them apart.  I credit both of them, still, regularly.  They can’t remember who said it, either. :-)  I gleaned and adapted things from Adult Children of Alcoholics—ideas about not passing on hurts from the past, about healing ourselves by helping others.  Being kind to our children in ways we KNOW children might appreciate, if our own childhoods had harsh parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn’t get any of my unschooling ideas from “the PEOPLE of the area I’m from.”  If I were to credit it anywhere but where it came from, I would be dishonest.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So when I hear that people are having problems with her in terms of inclusion-uh yah.

It is in the middle of Indian reservations.  I still cannot tell you where those borders are or how they work exactly despite driving through them quite often.  My schools name:  Juan de Onate Elementary.  Our mascot:  The Conquistadors.  In 4th grade we learned state history just like all the schools in California.  What history is that?  Missions.  Spanish history.  The history of who “found” this land and conquered it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis situation with Sandra needs to be addressed.

You don&#39;t need a lesson or a unit to show a child what&#39;s wonderful about woodgrain, ice crystals on the windshield, or birdsongs. Five seconds worth of pointing and saying &quot;Look, these trees were not native to North America&quot; might possibly lead to an hour long discussion, or a lifelong fascination. Bringing something interesting home, browsing in an antique shop, listening to new music on instruments you&#39;ve never heard—all those build neural pathways and give you a chance to be together in a special place.&quot;<br>\n-Sandra Dodd<br>\n<br>\n-=-[A]ll those build neural pathways.-=-<br>\n<br>\nTrue!  <br>\n<br>\nAnd literary knowledge and pathways are useful, too.  Knowing about Harry Potter, Romeo and Juliet, Lisa Simpson and her family/friends/neighbors.<br>\nDirect observation of skills and activities is good.  A very famous Korean chef said he didn’t have a teacher, but started as a talented teen, who learned gradually, by watching better cooks and seeing what they were doing.<br>\n<br>\nLately I’m concened about neural pathways being dug deep with falsehoods.  Another quote of me, from the last century:<br>\n<br>\n&quot;Just becuse there’s more than one truth doesn’t mean there’s no such thing as bullshit.&quot;   <br>\n<br>\nYou might have seen a cleaner version of it in a book or somewhere, but that is the original.<br>\n<br>\nI can defend unschooING (as I did it, wrote about it, shared about it, observed it in hundreds of happy, healthy families).<br>\nI cannot defend unschoolERS who use that term to excuse bad behavior, neglect, or active insertion of bad information.<br>\n<br>\nIt’s disturbing when someone combines unschooling with a different movement or belief, and then pressures others to agree, or to accept that they’re not really unschoolers. <br>\n<br>\nPLEASE don’t involve yourselves with any of that.<br>\n<br>\nKeep your own neural pathways open to evidence and newness.  Diets come and go.  Exercise programs, psychic wishing programs, reincarnation-related ideas about children choosing their own parents, kids coming from other planes (to very-special-parents only—all of those have come through unschooling discussions, and not become unschooling, and not destroyed the discussions.<br>\n<br>\nI have something to share, to show, but will post it later today or tomorrow.

You don&#39;t need a lesson or a unit to show a child what&#39;s wonderful about woodgrain, ice crystals on the windshield, or birdsongs. Five seconds worth of pointing and saying &quot;Look, these trees were not native to North America&quot; might possibly lead to an hour long discussion, or a lifelong fascination. Bringing something interesting home, browsing in an antique shop, listening to new music on instruments you&#39;ve never heard—all those build neural pathways and give you a chance to be together in a special place.&quot;<br/>\n-Sandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-[A]ll those build neural pathways.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd literary knowledge and pathways are useful, too.  Knowing about Harry Potter, Romeo and Juliet, Lisa Simpson and her family/friends/neighbors.<br/>\nDirect observation of skills and activities is good.  A very famous Korean chef said he didn’t have a teacher, but started as a talented teen, who learned gradually, by watching better cooks and seeing what they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I’m concened about neural pathways being dug deep with falsehoods.  Another quote of me, from the last century:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just becuse there’s more than one truth doesn’t mean there’s no such thing as bullshit.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might have seen a cleaner version of it in a book or somewhere, but that is the original.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can defend unschooING (as I did it, wrote about it, shared about it, observed it in hundreds of happy, healthy families).<br/>\nI cannot defend unschoolERS who use that term to excuse bad behavior, neglect, or active insertion of bad information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s disturbing when someone combines unschooling with a different movement or belief, and then pressures others to agree, or to accept that they’re not really unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE don’t involve yourselves with any of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your own neural pathways open to evidence and newness.  Diets come and go.  Exercise programs, psychic wishing programs, reincarnation-related ideas about children choosing their own parents, kids coming from other planes (to very-special-parents only—all of those have come through unschooling discussions, and not become unschooling, and not destroyed the discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have something to share, to show, but will post it later today or tomorrow.  It’s part of some slo-mo character assassination that’s been going on in secret and private groups for the past year and a half.  <br/>\nThey might stop if I would roll over and say the emperor has beautiful clothes, and there are four lights, not five.<br/>\nI doubt they would stop, even then, because drama and negativity can become an addiction.
