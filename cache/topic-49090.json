He says he hates to read.  and that he has no reason to learn to read since he cant play Roblox on the computer (it bluescreens whenever they try to).  So I said, &quot;well learning to read takes practice and once you learn to read you wont hate to anymore&quot;.<br/>\nAnd then I started thinking about the trueness of that statement.
