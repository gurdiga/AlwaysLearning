I have lost a few pounds with his help. It is a total hoot to hear my 9 year old telling me how to eat in a healthy manner. I had no clue that he knew so much about nutrition. I have always been very into eating a really healthy diet (I just eat too much of a healthy diet) but he has picked up more info than some nutritionists. Binging on healthy foods and not getting enough exercise are my problems. No treats or desserts for me unless I work them off these days. I only need to lose about 15-20 pounds but having his help is great. He is also the reason that is impossible for me to go exercise whenever I want. I can see that enlisting his support will make it much easier for me than trying to go off and do it on my own.
