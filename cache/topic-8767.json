Oops. Did I say that onlist? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some truly brilliant minds out there, and no, those school induced <br/>\ngifted labels do not identify them most of the time. Einstein was kicked out <br/>\nof school for being too dull and Edison for being a troublemaker. <br/>\nRecognizing your child&#39;s gifts is a good thing. And yes, some kids do really <br/>\nthrive on an accelerated pace. I call it unschooling on speed. But it&#39;s the <br/>\nchild who leads and the parent who tries to keep up. That&#39;s the unschooling <br/>\npart of it. Leading a child like this by the nose through a pre-planned set <br/>\nof study that the parents think is &quot;worthwhile&quot; will not lead to anything. <br/>\nTime to play and dream and think might lead to something really special <br/>\nthough. And it certainly won&#39;t harm the child the way a pushy parent with an <br/>\nagenda will.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren need freedom in order to learn. Truly brilliant minds are no <br/>\ndifferent. If this woman thinks her kids are brilliant, then they need time <br/>\nto think and daydream and ponder. They don&#39;t need to be led toward the right <br/>\nanswers, they need to be free to ponder the questions that haven&#39;t even been <br/>\nasked yet. They need to look at 2+2 and think of the hidden answer, the <br/>\nstuff that the brilliant minds of the past had not even been looking at. If <br/>\nthey truly are brilliant, then this is what happens. The wheels turn, the <br/>\nideas form, and always, always (as with with every human) the learning <br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary, the traditional radical unschooler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8723,"nextTopicId":8769}}
