And the light coming out of a <br/>\nbunch of those kids, and the relaxed faces of the moms reminds me of how lots <br/>\nof the families I see are NOT.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are the faces of kids who don&#39;t have to wake up at 6:00 a.m. to get <br/>\nready to get on a bus.  There are the faces of moms who aren&#39;t forcing kids <br/>\nto finish homework before they can read for fun, or play.  There are the <br/>\nfaces of a bunch of dads who know their kids on a daily basis, not just <br/>\nweekends or report card days.  There are parents who can see their kids <br/>\ndance, or sing, or demonstrate this&#39;or&#39;that without waiting for the school <br/>\nconcert or science fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby heard a schoolbell up close for the first time when he was thirteen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty will be surprised, when we go to the Japanese drumming performance <br/>\nlater this month, that we&#39;ll have to line up to go into the theatre, and be <br/>\ndismissed &quot;by class.&quot;  That&#39;s never happened to him.   He&#39;s thirteen.  He&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to laugh.  (Holly and I went to one of the shows in this series last <br/>\nweek, and it was TOTALLY a performance for schools.  So we were with <br/>\nTumbleweeds homeschool group, and the dismissals started in this order:  a <br/>\nhigh school group, probably the drama group; Monte Vista elementary, because <br/>\nthey&#39;re two blocks from the university and the kids would have been walking, <br/>\nnot getting on a bus; then us, then another homeschooling group.  So they <br/>\ncalled our &quot;school&quot; and we filed out from the rows they had told us to file <br/>\ninto.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing those photos, and I hope we&#39;ll get to see more as others <br/>\nhere get to scanners, or join the group, or find just the coolest photo of <br/>\ntheir family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for being here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4905,"nextTopicId":4915}}
