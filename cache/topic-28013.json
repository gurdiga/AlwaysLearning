Eventually she grew bigger and<br/>\n  older and we were able to let go of our anxiety and trust that she was <br/>\nbreathing<br/>\n and get on with just appreciating how beautiful she was.<br/>\n  Coming to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the <br/>\nneed<br/>\n  to check that your child is learning, so try to do it without <br/>\ndisturbing her.<br/>\n  Eventually - or probably quickly - it will become abundantly clear <br/>\nthat<br/>\n  she is learning and you can let go of that checking, and just <br/>\nappreciate herwonder.<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI meant to respond the first time it came through. I immediately <br/>\nthought of the opposite:<br/>\n<br/>\nChecking on the learning too often looks more like Shirley McLain in <br/>\nTerms of Endearment. Not only was the baby in another bed in another <br/>\nroom---so how could she really know from way in the next room?  But she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hear/see her daughter breathing, so she frantically pinches <br/>\nher, wakes her, and then walks away happy while the baby screams her <br/>\nhead off.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---try not to do that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat analogy, Robyn!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
