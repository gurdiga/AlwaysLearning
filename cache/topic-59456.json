None in our family are too into football, but my 8 year old son thinks it&#39;s fun to watch the commercials (I agree!)  and this year he was even rooting for a team too, &quot;because they have yellow pants, Mom  YELLOW pants  that&#39;s just SO awesome!!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, so we went shopping for snacks, and my son picked out a big bag of honey barbecue potato chips  a flavor that&#39;s a new favorite of his.  We brought them home and placed the bag on the counter, along with the tortilla chips, beans, avocados, etc. that we bought to make bean dip for whoever wanted some of that to snack on during the game/commercials too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart way through dinner that night, my son looked over at the counter, looked over at me, and said, &quot;Mom, you only live once, right?  And if you only live once, shouldn&#39;t you have honey barbecue chips with your dinner the day BEFORE the Super Bowl, if you want them the day before the Super Bowl, even if they are called Super Bowl snacks?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you should.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"&quot;have to&quot; wait for it","postDate":"1296834971","msgId":59456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1MEVEMzQ1LUM4MkItNDc3Ny05RjA2LTRFRjY3QUEwQkUzRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59968,"prevInTime":59455,"nextInTime":59457,"topicId":59456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On TV, some cook on Good Morning America, talking about food to serve during the Super Bowl, and she says I don t serve dessert until the fourth quarter,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1800570259\">On TV, some cook on Good Morning America, talking about food to serve during the Super Bowl, and she says &quot;I don&#39;t serve dessert until the fourth quarter, because you have to wait for it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s making all kinds of meat, vegetable, cheese things. Bean dip, beer prezels with dip.   She&#39;s already telling the other people who are there tasting her samples that they&#39;re eating too much.

Maybe too much food, too, unless she was having 20 people over.  But &quot;too much food&quot; is part of a feast or a party.
