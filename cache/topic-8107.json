The tricky part was getting <br/>\nthe reservations all lined up.  We were able to book the family sleeping car, <br/>\nwhich was all across the back of the sleeping car, and was a wonderful space <br/>\nfor us.  Food was hard.  We couldn&#39;t bring enough to feed ourselves thro the <br/>\nwhole trip, and often the wait at the dining car was way too long for kids to <br/>\nhandle.  Totally different - prompt service on the return trip, so I guess it <br/>\ndepends on the staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is loving attending community college.  I spoke to her teacher <br/>\nafter the dance concert (my daughter was in the teacher&#39;s modern piece which <br/>\nwas all about the teacher&#39;s siblings and their father&#39;s death).  Her teacher <br/>\ntold me it was so refreshing to have a student that had some intellectual <br/>\ngrasp of what was going on.  Her nutrition instructor told her she loved <br/>\nhaving her in class since she proved if you show up and pay attention you can <br/>\ndo well (ie -get good grades :-) ), and learn the material.  What can I say?? <br/>\nMy daughter is simply interested in what is going on there, and it shows.  Is <br/>\nit because she didn&#39;t attend school until college, is it because she is <br/>\nmature beyond her years, is it because she has always been academically <br/>\nminded??  Who knows - but I am thrilled when she shares what she is learning, <br/>\nand is excited about being and doing her life.  That excitement is my <br/>\ndefinition of having focus and passion in your life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8104,"nextTopicId":8102}}
