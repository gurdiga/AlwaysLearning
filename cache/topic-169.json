Extra!<br/>\nInterview with Howard Gardner<br/>\n<br/>\nHoward Gardner, director of the Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School <br/>\nof Education, introduced the theory of multiple intelligences in 1983. <br/>\nGardner spoke recently with NEA Today&#39;s Stefanie Weiss, and a condensed <br/>\nversion of that interview appears in the March issue. Just for NEA Today <br/>\nOnline readers, here&#39;s the full interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give a shorthand version of your theory of multiple intelligences?<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiple intelligences is a psychological theory about the mind. It’s a <br/>\ncritique of the notion that there’s a single intelligence which we’re born <br/>\nwith, which can’t be changed, and which psychologists can measure. It’s <br/>\nbased on a lot of scientific research in fields ranging from psychology to <br/>\nanthropology to biology. It’s not based upon based on test correlations, <br/>\nwhich most other intelligence theories are based on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe claim is that there are at least eight different human intelligences. <br/>\nMost intelligence tests look at language or logic or both – those are just <br/>\ntwo of the intelligences. The other six are musical, spatial, <br/>\nbodily/kinestheic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist. <br/>\n<br/>\nI make two claims. The first claim is that all human beings have all of these <br/>\nintelligences. It’s part of our species definition. The second claim is that, <br/>\nboth because of our genetics and our environment, no two people have exactly <br/>\nthe same profile of intelligences, not even identical twins, because their <br/>\nexperiences are different. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where we shift from science to education. If we all have different <br/>\nkinds of minds, we have a choice. We can either ignore those differences and <br/>\nteach everybody the same stuff in the same way and assess everybody in the <br/>\nsame way. Or we can say, look, people learn in different kinds of ways, and <br/>\nthey have different intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Let’s take that <br/>\ninto account in how we teach and how we assess. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo how should teachers who believe in your theory change their approach to <br/>\nteaching?<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiple intelligences (MI) is a tool. It’s not a goal. That means that you <br/>\nhave to decide what you want to teach, and that should be based on what you <br/>\nthink is important. Nowadays often it’s other people who are telling us what <br/>\nto teach. That’s not what I favor. But whoever makes the decisions, once <br/>\nthose decisions are made, that’s when MI can come into action. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own work, I’m a proponent of teaching for understanding, which means <br/>\ngoing deeply into topics so that students can really make use of knowledge in <br/>\nnew situations. This is very, very different from most teaching, where people <br/>\nmemorize material and can reproduce it on demand but can’t make use of it in <br/>\nnew situations. That’s what understanding entails. If you favor education for <br/>\nunderstanding the way I do, then MI can be extremely helpful. Because when <br/>\nyou are teaching a topic, you can approach the topic in many ways, thereby <br/>\nactivating different intelligences. You can provide analogies and metaphors <br/>\nfor different domains, invading different intelligences, and finally, you can <br/>\npresent the key ideas in a number of different languages or symbol systems, <br/>\nagain activating different intelligences. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut obviously you can’t do that if you’re going to spend five minutes on a <br/>\ntopic and then move on to something. Then you’re almost constrained to <br/>\npresent it one way, which is usually verbally, and to give people a <br/>\nshort-answer test. You can see that I’m very much in opposition to the <br/>\ncurrent state and national trends, which create more tests, often of a <br/>\nshort-answer sort, favoring coverage or noncoverage and not probing deeply <br/>\ninto what people really understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan standardized tests ever hope to measure children’s full intelligence?<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m not in favor of tests that are designed to measure people’s <br/>\nintelligence, because frankly I don’t care what intelligence or intelligences <br/>\npeople have. I care whether they can do things which we value in our culture. <br/>\nWhat good is it to know if you have an IQ of 90 or 110 – or even if you can <br/>\njack it up to 120 through a lot of training – if, in the end, you can’t do <br/>\nanything. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think our assessments ought to focus on the kinds of things we want people <br/>\nto understand, and they ought to give people a chance to perform their <br/>\nunderstandings. Because, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if you have <br/>\nan IQ of 160 if you sit around and do nothing. What’s important is whatever <br/>\nIQ you have or whatever profile of intelligences you have, that you can <br/>\ndemonstrate knowledge and understanding of things that matter.<br/>\nSo do you think the high-stakes testing movement that we’re seeing now is <br/>\ngoing to force people to abandon different approaches to teaching?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Current approaches almost inevitably push people to teach to the test, <br/>\nbecause those tests are so high-stake both for students and for teachers. <br/>\nNow, in principle, one could have assessments which probe understanding, and <br/>\nthey could even be standardized. I would be much more in favor of those <br/>\nassessments. But those assessments would have to give people lots of choices. <br/>\nBecause, say you’re doing American history, you have to say to people, “I <br/>\nwant you to discuss, let’s say, the role of immigration in America, but you <br/>\ncan discuss it with reference to any one of 20 different groups or 20 <br/>\ndifferent issues.&quot; If, on the other hand, you require people to know all 20 <br/>\ndifferent groups and all 20 issues, then obviously, they can’t know very much <br/>\nabout any one of them. It’s just a very superficial, Jeopardy-style <br/>\nknowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow let’s be clear about this: Assessment is fine. Even standardized <br/>\nassessment is fine, if it looks at things which are important and allows us <br/>\nto probe in-depth what people understand. But if it’s just whether you <br/>\nmemorized the encyclopedia and can spit it out, it’s of no value, because a <br/>\nyear later, even six months later, you’ll have forgotten everything because <br/>\nyou will not have had any kind of understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you respond to those who say that MI theory is appealing, but there’s <br/>\nno proof to back it up?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s no short answer to that question. To begin with, it’s a scientific <br/>\ntheory, and so it needs to be evaluated on the basis of the science on which <br/>\nit draws. And I think it does quite well in terms of the scientific evidence, <br/>\neven the evidence that’s accumulated since the theory was first propounded 20 <br/>\nyears ago. I have a new book coming out this fall called Multiple <br/>\nIntelligences Reframed, where in fact I discuss a few new intelligences, and <br/>\nalso discuss the scientific evidence for it. So when people say it hasn’t <br/>\nbeen proved, we first have to say what’s the scientific evidence for and <br/>\nagainst it--and I think the scientific evidence stacks pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I’ve never espoused a particular program in schools. There are no <br/>\nGardner schools, and there is no MI approach. So when people say it hasn’t <br/>\nbeen proved, it’s a senseless statement. What you have to say is, “Has this <br/>\nparticular implementation of MI theory, in this particular place, produced <br/>\nbetter student learning?” <br/>\n<br/>\nMindy Kornhaber at Project Zero has been investigating 42 different schools <br/>\nwhich have been using MI theory for at least three years, and those schools <br/>\nreport a lot of success with students, on both hard measures--how they do on <br/>\ntests--and on softer measures, like absenteeism and parental involvement. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was interviewed by Time magazine and asked about the effects of MI in <br/>\nschools, I was very cautious, because even if those schools are doing <br/>\nwonderfully, we don’t know for sure whether it’s because of MI. There are a <br/>\nhundred different things that could be going on in those schools. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was criticized for being honest. The implication was that if I lied and <br/>\nsaid these schools are better and we know it’s because of MI theory, then <br/>\ntherefore the theory would have been proved correct. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this question is much more detailed and technical than the question itself <br/>\nimplies. But if you want a flip answer, the flip answer is, if we know the <br/>\nother approaches haven’t worked because we wouldn’t be in the situation <br/>\nwe’re in if they had, then you’d be a fool not to try something new. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I hope I’ve made clear to you, there isn’t a single MI approach. <br/>\nBasically, the idea is if you value the differences among students and take <br/>\nthem very seriously, that should have implications for how you present <br/>\nmaterial. That’s the only absolute implication from the theory. But whether <br/>\nyou teach seven courses or eight courses or you teach something seven ways or <br/>\neight ways, or you teach to strength or you teach to weakness, those are all <br/>\ndecisions made by educators. They don’t follow from the theory. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you working with any particular schools? Are you working with the Key <br/>\nSchool now?<br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to have relationships with certain schools where I’ve known the <br/>\npeople for a long time. One of them is the Key School, which is now called <br/>\nthe Key Learning Community. Another is the New City School in St. Louis. I <br/>\nvisit those schools on a regular basis. I will visit both schools this year <br/>\nagain. But it’s their school. It’s not my school. And I take great pride <br/>\nwhen good things happen there, but I’m not egocentric enough to assume that <br/>\nit’s because I make visits out there or because they’ve read my books. It’s <br/>\nbecause they’re good educators.<br/>\nI think this is really important for your readers to understand, because most <br/>\nnames they’ve heard of and most approaches they’ve heard of, somebody’s got <br/>\na line, so to speak, or a set of principles, so to speak, or a program or a <br/>\npackage. I’ve got nothing like that. I’ve got a set of ideas, and I’m most <br/>\ninterested when people use those ideas in ways that make sense to them, not <br/>\nwhen somebody else tells them you’ve got to teach this in seven different <br/>\nways because Gardner says there’s seven different intelligences.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can people sort through all the MI stuff that’s out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a matter of principle, I don’t endorse any commercial products, so no <br/>\nconclusions should be drawn one way or the other. I would say that it <br/>\nprobably is a big mistake to rely only on one person or one book. In the new <br/>\nbook, Multiple Intelligences Reframed, I list almost 100 books on the topic <br/>\nand hundreds and hundreds of articles, and so I think any smart consumer <br/>\nought to:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Look at a number of different publications, <br/>\n*   Visit a number of different schools or go to a number of different <br/>\nworkshops--God knows there are enough of them,<br/>\n*   And most important, start a learning community at your own school, where <br/>\nyou read some of the texts, hopefully including mine, where you talk about <br/>\nthe ideas, where you examine your own intelligences--where you’re strong, <br/>\nwhere you’re weak, how that affects your teaching, what you might do <br/>\ndifferently if you had a different set of intelligences. Watch some of the <br/>\nteachers, exchange and trade classes, and then begin to try things out with <br/>\nkids and see whether, if you take a more pluralistic approach, that you <br/>\nachieve greater success with kids with whom you’re not having success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s no point in doing anything with MI if you think you’re doing a great <br/>\njob. You just keep doing what you’re doing. It’s when things aren’t going as <br/>\nwell as you want, when there are certain kids who you’re not reaching, or you <br/>\nhave kids who are excited but they’re not able to demonstrate their <br/>\nunderstanding, then you’ve got a problem. That’s when I think you should <br/>\nlook at ideas like MI and see if they’re useful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another book coming out this year, called The Disciplined Mind: What <br/>\nAll Students Should Understand. And in that book, I talk about what <br/>\nunderstanding is, and how elusive it is, and how we can approach deeper <br/>\nunderstanding for our kids. At the end of the book, I show how to take three <br/>\ntopics, one from science (the theory of evolution), one from the arts (the <br/>\nmusic of Mozart), and one from history (the Holocaust), and really engender <br/>\ndeep understandings by taking an MI approach very seriously. It&#39;s not only <br/>\nwhat I mentioned earlier – the entry points, the analogies, and the model <br/>\nlanguages – but also giving students lots of different ways of showing how <br/>\nthey understand something. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was once interviewed on radio about MI. I said I bet you could teach about <br/>\nthe Civil War using dance, and I got lots of hate mail. I thought about it <br/>\nfor a while, and I thought about the Spanish Civil War and the painting <br/>\nGuernica. And I said I bet you more people understand more about the Spanish <br/>\nCivil War from Picasso’s Guernica than from reading the textbook on the <br/>\ntopic. Almost anything can be illuminated in surprising ways if you open up <br/>\nyour mind to the variety of intelligences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is it said that the only way to learn about something is to read a <br/>\nchapter on it and answer a set of short-answer questions? Certainly in other <br/>\ncountries, they don’t do that. But part of our numerical, standardized test <br/>\nbias is many people think that’s the only way to show something. And the <br/>\ngreatest paradox is that people who were often the worst students when they <br/>\nwere young are the ones who believe that the strongest, whereas people who <br/>\nwere better students, who had more of a liberal arts education, understand <br/>\nthat the questions we ask are more important than the answers that we come up <br/>\nwith, and the more ways that we can think about something, the deeper our <br/>\nunderstanding is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you say to people who say that linguistic and logical-mathematical <br/>\nintelligences are more important than the other six?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s no question that if you have a certain combination of language and <br/>\nlogic, you’re going to be facile in handling the kinds of tests we usually <br/>\ngive, and as long as you stay in school, you’ll think you’re smart. If you <br/>\never should walk out into the street, you might be in for a huge shock. <br/>\nConversely, if you’re not good in language and logic in school, you’ll have <br/>\na harder time because you’ll think you’re dumb, and you kind of have to get <br/>\nthrough school to show what it is that you can accomplish in life. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there’s a very important distinction between the intelligence and <br/>\nthe domain. An intelligence is a way of processing, which your mind/brain <br/>\nhas. A domain is a subject or topic that you want to master. Any domain can <br/>\nbe mastered through a lot of different intelligences. You don’t have to use <br/>\nlanguage and logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you’re trying to understand history or science or arts, you can use <br/>\nintelligences like spatial intelligence or musical intelligence or personal <br/>\nintelligence or the naturalist intelligence. A large part of education, <br/>\nwhether it’s self-education or scholastic education, is figuring how to get <br/>\nyour particular mind/brain to learn what it is that it needs to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you’re not very good in language and logic, you’ve got three choices: <br/>\none is to punt, the other is to improve those--and if you can improve them, <br/>\ngreat--and the third is to say, well I can learn about things in other ways. <br/>\nLet’s see whether I can use those other ways to do a better job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m very bad with maps, spatial kinds of things, geometry. I try to exercise <br/>\nmy spatial muscles, and they’ve probably gotten somewhat better. But there <br/>\nare lots of other ways to find your way around besides maps, and it’s often <br/>\nvery good to use the intelligences that are there. <br/>\nIndeed I often say that if anybody doesn’t believe in multiple intelligences, <br/>\nthey should go on an automobile ride with three other people and get totally <br/>\nlost and see how each person tries to get back home. That will make them an <br/>\ninstant convert to the theory of multiple intelligences. People do not think <br/>\nthe same way.<br/>\nWhat does a first grade teacher need to know about MI compared to, say, a <br/>\nhigh school biology teacher?<br/>\nThe very basic claims that I talked about, namely that we all have these <br/>\nintelligences but that we differ from one another. I think that’s clearly <br/>\nsomething everybody should know. But the task of a first grade teacher is not <br/>\nidentical to that of a high school teacher. One thing which I think the <br/>\nUnited States is very bad on is most first grade teachers don’t know what’s <br/>\ngoing on in high school and vice versa, and I think we both lose that way. <br/>\nI’m in favor of what are called pathways, where you really think education <br/>\nthrough from K to 12. <br/>\nThat being said, I believe that the purpose of later education – middle <br/>\nschool, high school, and beyond – is to master the disciplines. So the <br/>\nquestion that I confront in The Disciplined Mind is, how can our knowledge, <br/>\ngiven the intelligences, help us learn to think like a historian, like a <br/>\nscientist, and so on? If we don’t change the way people think about those <br/>\nthings, then school is a waste of time after elementary school.<br/>\nOn the other hand, in elementary school, that’s basically not a time for <br/>\ndisciplined learning. It’s a time for getting excited about learning, to be <br/>\ncurious about things, to be motivated, to want to find out more, and then to <br/>\nbegin to introduce some very gross distinctions – like the difference between <br/>\nsomething that happened that we’re trying to describe historically and <br/>\nsomething that was invented, like a fable. That’s the kind of thing that kids <br/>\nneed to begin to understand when they’re 8, 9, 10, 11 years of age, because <br/>\notherwise they won’t understand history. <br/>\nSimilarly, science consists of claims for which evidence exists, and you can <br/>\naccumulate more evidence, for or against a particular point. That’s very <br/>\ndifferent from something that’s just a question of opinion or belief. And <br/>\nagain, that’s the kind of thing that should be handled in the elementary <br/>\nyears because otherwise you’ll never be able to learn the disciplines. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":165,"nextTopicId":168}}
