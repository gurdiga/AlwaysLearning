My immediate thoughts<br/>\nwere that I want my child to have the freedom to study something he<br/>\nloves in-depth and practice it in a meaningful way to him.  What a<br/>\nwonderful gift to my child!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI sent this video clip to my niece who is 13.  She stated a couple<br/>\nyears ago that she wanted to be a veterinarian &quot;when she grew up&quot;<br/>\nbecause she loves animals.  But her parents resonded by telling her<br/>\nthe &quot;gross&quot; parts of the job, and so she then said she wasn&#39;t sure she<br/>\ncould do that.  I was so sad.  She really does love animals and would<br/>\nspend all her time with them if she could, but she is also in school<br/>\nand really too busy to do more than have a couple pets of her own to<br/>\ncare for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither the article nor video clip state whether the girl is<br/>\nhomeschooled (or unschooled, for that matter), but it is certainly a<br/>\nwonderful example for unschoolers and new parents like myself of <br/>\nanother real life example of what&#39;s possible for our children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis little news story also came at an appropriate time for me as I<br/>\njust finished reading &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot;.  I admit that by<br/>\nmidway through the book I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with all that<br/>\nI interpreted to be involved in finding unconventional ways to expose<br/>\nour children to &quot;school subjects&quot; in the real world.  (I know it&#39;s not<br/>\nnecessarily helpful to look at the world in terms of subjects, but<br/>\nrefer to it that way only because that&#39;s how the book is outlined.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, finally the last chapter discussed something that really<br/>\nresonated with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote from page 215, &quot;That so many children become lost when they<br/>\nreach the legal age of majority shouldn&#39;t be surprising.  With all<br/>\ntheir years in school, with classes and assignments scheduled<br/>\nthroughout for them, when and where do most children get a chance to<br/>\nfeel useful, to create a meaningful place for themselves?  They&#39;re<br/>\nconsidered too young, too immature, too unreliable, too untrustworthy<br/>\nto be allowed to do much of any real value; it&#39;s no wonder so many<br/>\nturn to their peers for affirmation and respect.  We &quot;protect&quot; them<br/>\nfrom doing anything much in the way of real, meaningful work, deny<br/>\nthem the opportunity to find places where they are truly needed, and<br/>\nthen turn around and blame them for never doing anything worthwhile.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I took away from this is that locking children up in school for<br/>\n12 years inhibits their abilities to find meaningful things for<br/>\nthemselves and their lives.  Yes, it&#39;s true that a schooled child can<br/>\nfind meaningful things in their lives, but school interferes by taking<br/>\nup too much time and energy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking the last couple days and trying to put into concise<br/>\nwords why I want to unschool my child (partly for my own thought<br/>\norganization, but also for those inquiring family and friends).  The<br/>\nbasic theme I came up with was one word - FREEDOM.  Freedom for my<br/>\nchild to have the time, space, and resources to live and explore life<br/>\nin a meaningful way to him.  Freedom for our family to have the time<br/>\nand space to be together and share our lives without the dictations<br/>\nand restrictions of school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this video was my dose of the &quot;warm and fuzzies&quot; for the day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31863,"nextTopicId":31906}}
