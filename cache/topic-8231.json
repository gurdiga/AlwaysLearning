She&#39;ll eat fruit rolls, &quot;made with 10% real fruit!&quot; A few more<br/>\n&gt;things along those lines. She survives on Bagel Bites (there&#39;s that tomato<br/>\n&gt;sauce again), bread and butter, and various meat and dairy products. In one<br/>\n&gt;of my few eating-coercive moves (in fact, the only one I can think of &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;give her a multi-vitamin every day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her sister likes some fruits but not veggies (except for huge green <br/>\n&gt;salads),<br/>\n&gt;and gets the same vitamin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Both appear to be healthy as horses.

Around midday, I&#39;ll see who&#39;s hungry and let them know<br/>\nwhat&#39;s available; it&#39;s a joint effort. Supper I&#39;ll make, unless we&#39;ve had a<br/>\nbig lunch, in which case it&#39;s snacktime. I keep fruits and veggies available<br/>\nas much as possible, and try to have them at each meal, even if it&#39;s just a<br/>\nbag of baby carrots slung on the table. For snacks, which they can have<br/>\nwhenever they&#39;re hungry, they choose between yogurt, pudding, fruit,<br/>\npretzels, or candy. They rarely choose the candy, and if I do come in to<br/>\nfind a stack of empty Hershey Kisses wrappers, I chalk it up to the<br/>\noccasional chocolate attack. Heck, I have those too.

It isn&#39;t like I&#39;m not being responsive -- <br/>\nbut I&#39;m the one who sees the big picture about food. I&#39;m the one who knows we <br/>\nneed stuff that we can prepare really quickly on Tuesday and Thursdays <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re busy on those days and that we need stuff to take to the park <br/>\non Wednesdays and so on.  I don&#39;t think the kids need to start doing that <br/>\nkind of &quot;meta-thinking&quot; that their parents do - let them live &quot;in the moment&quot; <br/>\nas they usually do. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids didn&#39;t do a lot of unreasonable begging for things in the grocery <br/>\nstores. I always buy what they ask for - seldom say no - and only if I really <br/>\ndo have a good reason. I think that was because, when they were really <br/>\nlittle, we&#39;d walk in the door with them knowing that they could pick out <br/>\nsomething special. I never made a big deal out of it being ONE thing special <br/>\n- never really thought about it that much - it was just fun - as we walked up <br/>\nto the door I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay - so what really special thing are you going to <br/>\nget today?&quot; They&#39;d spend the time choosing between different things - to <br/>\nfigure out what the special thing was going to be -- cookies or ice cream or <br/>\nwhatever. I guess if they wanted something more I probably said things like, <br/>\n&quot;Hey - that can be your special thing next time&quot; or something like that. This <br/>\nwas when they were really little - like under five. After that I just don&#39;t <br/>\nremember - it was not a problem. I don&#39;t usually take them now unless they <br/>\nreally want to go - they all have a tendency to TALK my ear off while I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to shop and I always forget something important - even with a list (I <br/>\njust somehow don&#39;t see it on the list). If they really want to go - then I <br/>\nfigure it is because they want to spend time alone with me - so then I&#39;m GLAD <br/>\nto do that - how cool is it when our kids WANT to hang out with us, even when <br/>\nwe&#39;re just grocery shopping -- that&#39;s NICE! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d concentrate on having enticing and reasonably healthy stuff easily <br/>\navailable. And maybe finding a way to go grocery shopping without them most <br/>\nof the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;deschooling&quot; food","postDate":"1028132604","msgId":8249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBIMDQwMDA0Wkc3MExEQG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":8237,"nextInTopic":8252,"prevInTime":8248,"nextInTime":8250,"topicId":8231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My two big hopes are that I ll eliminate the whining for expensive cereals at the grocery store and that they will eventually choose to eat their own fruits","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-656377193\">My two big hopes are that I&#39;ll eliminate the whining for expensive <br/>\ncereals at the grocery store and that they will eventually choose to<br/>\neat their own fruits and veggies without me making them.

Will they<br/>\ngrow up healthy?<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old (who will be 5 in October) eats no fruit or vegetable that<br/>\nis close to its original self -- she&#39;ll eat pizza, which contains tomatoes<br/>\nin sauce. She&#39;ll eat fruit rolls, &quot;made with 10% real fruit!&quot; A few more<br/>\nthings along those lines. She survives on Bagel Bites (there&#39;s that tomato<br/>\nsauce again), bread and butter, and various meat and dairy products.
