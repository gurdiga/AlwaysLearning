She&#39;s really not into this is she?  I guess it&#39;s a man thing.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI too have gone through the whole worry thing about play army - our son is passionate about anything military.  There is no recent military history in our family.  He loves reenacting wars and battles.  Which has had it&#39;s great moments too. When younger he spent hours and days digging a huge hole to get into as a bunker - the hole is still there in the yard.   He and a few friends made a film 2 yrs ago which we watched again the other day and everyone had a good laugh;  he knows more war history and details than the majority of people.  He has favorite planes from WWII, etc.  He knows war history from ancient battles to modern.  When he was younger I&#39;d have one on one talks with him about why it bothered me just so he knew my why.  I would talk about how I worried how he might get the impression that war was fun - and he informed me he wasn&#39;t stupid, that he KNEW war was terrible and horribly hurtful - he was just having fun with something that interested him. He loved to put plastic army men in the Christmas tree - which bothered me to no end so we talked about my feelings too.  He is so independent and has such a soft heart it is quite a contradiction at times with his passion for war/military.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe took HapKiDo (martial arts) for 7 years and then asked to stop about 6 months away from a black belt - he was just wanting to move on after twice a week for 7 years so we moved on.  It has been 2 years since he moved on and has never said he wished he&#39;d continued.   Now he is into carving wood and wanting to take horse back riding - which he has done a bit here and there but not regular so I think that is next.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack when our son was in school he was evaluated and the evaluator insisted we seek counseling because he was so into war and guns, etc. that she was worried.  She even brought up examples of shootings in the USA and we frankly were offended. When I tried to talk to her about his passion for the history and facts as well as strategy and economics of war, etc. she just insisted that his fascination went beyond the norm.  So we have also had talks with our son over the years about society&#39;s expectations and how his passion with guns, knives, war can be alarming to many. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom reassures me that my very peaceful brother also played war - and I remember playing cowboys and Indians a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=I have a fear that my sons aggression and passion for hitting/ <br/>\n  karate/guns/swords will continue-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-I have a fear that ... the peaceful soul of his when he was 3 and <br/>\n  4 will be lost in that power play stuff.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Power play stuff&quot; is part of becoming a man.<br/>\n  You want him to grow up to be a man and not a peaceful three year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lots of VERY gentle men grew up playing rough.<br/>\n  Lots of very angry men grew up not being allowed to play rough <br/>\n  (having to sneak it, or being punished for it).<br/>\n  . <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] mama fears","postDate":"1183229303","msgId":29696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwOEU0RTlCLUVBOUQtNDhFOC05OEIyLTcyMDQ4MkU5MDBFMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3NDU3MS42NjczMy5xbUB3ZWIzNDIwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY3NDU3MS42NjczMy5xbUB3ZWIzNDIwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29692,"nextInTopic":29698,"prevInTime":29695,"nextInTime":29697,"topicId":29692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=I have a fear that my sons aggression and passion for hitting/ karate/guns/swords will continue-=- Playing karate isn t the same as knowing karate.

I try and let him be the top of all I can.  I hate it that he hurts his brother when I&#39;m not in the room or lets his play get so rough that he ends up hurting his brother.  The only thing that saves me so far is that he gets queasy at the sight of blood...so...   Letting him be so DIFFERENT than me - the tree hugger, bug saving, respect for all kinds of life mama - is a challenge for my own soul sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe youngest has been running since 8 months and my fear with him is that he wont think before he does something.
