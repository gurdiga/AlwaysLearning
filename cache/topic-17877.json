I don&#39;t think I said anything new, just shared how it&#39;s been working in my family.  And my title is a pretty blatant rip-off of from Everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten.  This morning I noticed a similar title in a HEM article.  Well, it is catchy, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent my mom the link.  She said she read several other articles while she was there and she enjoyed them!  Maybe it will result in some small influence on my brother and sil, the next time they ask her not to let my nephew watch TV when she babysits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually sent an email to this, or maybe it was the unschooling list, encouraging people to do the No TV week.  That must have been about 4 or 5 years ago.  One of the things Sandra said in response was to consider how I would like to have a no computer week for myself.  Yikes!  That made me think, especially since I wanted to impose the No TV week on my family, it wasn&#39;t their idea.  I did end up going through with the no TV week that year, though.  It was easy enough to do, but didn&#39;t make any difference in our viewing when the week was over.  I&#39;m glad I finally saw the light!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----In a message dated 1/16/04 12:05:24 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Everything I really need to know I learned from video games and cheesy<br/>\n<br/>\n  cartoons. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enshrined.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  fourth box<br/>\n<br/>\n  WONDERFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can try to talk me out of having it there by e-mail later if you want, <br/>\n  but I want to keep it there so other families will loosen up and see more light <br/>\n  (from televisions or inside their souls or the sun or lava lamps or <br/>\n  *whatever*)!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154422553,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisulam@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Everything I really need to know","postDate":"1074376956","msgId":17928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PElORU5MQU5QUENKSEFJUE9NRklPQ0VJQ0NDQUEua3Jpc3VsYW1AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzQzNzM3MTkuNjQzOTguMjA1OC5tMTdAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17905,"nextInTopic":17944,"prevInTime":17927,"nextInTime":17929,"topicId":17877,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You shoulda called this post  If you give a mouse a TV... ...

I<br/>\nused to think that TV was bad in general (books always better!), and at the<br/>\nvery least, children&#39;s exposure to TV should be limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now going into our 3rd year of removing all limits from TV. It<br/>\nstarted when Pat back-doored a new large screen TV into the house. This<br/>\ncoincided with the winter Olympics, so we hooked up to cable after a couple<br/>\nof years without it. We got the expanded cable, since that offered many more<br/>\nstations that appealed to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls and I did a *unit study* on the Olympics. I use the term loosely,<br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t sit down and plan units or require reports on what they<br/>\nlearned.  Basically, we watched and watched and watched Olympics coverage,<br/>\nbought the official program in order to follow events more easily, got<br/>\nlibrary books about Michelle Kwan and other Olympic stars present and past,<br/>\nand recorded some of our favorite events for repeat viewing.  We even got<br/>\nthe Olympic soundtrack CD.  While watching, all sorts of tidbits came up for<br/>\ndiscussion.  Where our favorite athletes were from had us frequently<br/>\ngrabbing the globe or an atlas.  How were events scored, why did some<br/>\ncountries have many participants and others only a few, what is a sport,<br/>\nsportsmanship, and much more.   Some nice unplanned things occurred at the<br/>\nsame time. Pat was working with some people from Spain, and a couple of them<br/>\ncame to visit. They came to dinner at our house and spent the evening<br/>\nwatching and discussing Olympics with us. This was the night that Ice<br/>\nDancing was on, and we had a spirited discussion on whether this should<br/>\nqualify as a sport, or not.  It was exciting for all of us to have a foreign<br/>\nperson associated with the international sports industry spend time with us.<br/>\nThat it happened during the world&#39;s most popular sports competition was<br/>\nreally cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends went to Austria that winter and brought the girls hats like the<br/>\nones worn by some of the Austrian cross country skiers. The hats are gray<br/>\nwith a tuft of bright colored fluff at the top, so it looks a bit as if you<br/>\nare wearing a headband with bright hair sticking out the top. These hats<br/>\ncame about because some performance enhancing drugs used by some of the<br/>\nskiers caused their hair to turn gray. The skiers would dye their hair<br/>\nbright colors to mask it. This presented an opportunity to talk about drugs<br/>\nand their possible effects on one&#39;s health and career.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince that time, TV viewing has waxed and waned. Sometimes it is on way too<br/>\nmuch for my taste. Other times the girls go days without watching. Nobody<br/>\nwould disagree that some TV programs are *educational* and well worth<br/>\nwatching. But my kids have also learned so much from what I would have once<br/>\ncalled &quot;stupid cartoons&quot;.  Last night, Lisa was watching a cartoon - The<br/>\nProud Family. The episode involved a girl going back in time to the 1950s<br/>\nand covered many of the realities of segregation.  She even quoted part of<br/>\nMLK&#39;s famous I Have a Dream speech. I have a children&#39;s picture book about<br/>\nthat. I need to dig it out and read it while it&#39;s fresh in our minds.<br/>\nBesides, his holiday is coming up on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Simpsons, although not always *polite* are very funny and are always<br/>\nmaking references to things that many people would consider education<br/>\nmaterial.  Watching an episode with my children always brings up many<br/>\ninteresting topics to discuss.  Besides, we laugh a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to now, we have never had any video games in our house. It wasn&#39;t that I<br/>\npurposely avoided them, it was just something we&#39;d never done and the girls<br/>\nhad never asked for. I had a vague idea in my head that they were negative<br/>\nalong the lines of TV and other electronic media. Generally, when video<br/>\ngames make the news it is not positive. I had never before questioned these<br/>\nideas. Lisa had mentioned playing a race car game at her friend&#39;s house.  We<br/>\ndecided to give the girls a Nintendo64 for Christmas.  This morning I played<br/>\nCrusin World with Lisa. The game is full of famous landmarks. It is not<br/>\ntotally realistic, but does match many real aspects of the countries you<br/>\nrace through. While cruising Germany, I mentioned the autobahn. I don&#39;t know<br/>\ntoo much about it, except that people drive really fast there. This led us<br/>\nto consider mph vs. kph, which led to the metric vs. US system of<br/>\nmeasurement. I told Lisa that I had bought some stuff to help learn the<br/>\nmetric system because I wanted to understand it better. She said, &quot;We can<br/>\nlearn it together&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt never ceases to amaze me how doing one thing can lead to learning about<br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we do get around to learning more about metrics, I wonder how much she&#39;ll<br/>\nabsorb. I studied this in school, but I never internalized it. I mean, I can<br/>\nlook up the formulas and use them to figure out conversions, but hearing a<br/>\nmetric measurement still doesn&#39;t mean much to me.  I wonder if she will<br/>\nlearn it more easily, because she will not be pressured to learn it for a<br/>\ntest.  If she learns it, it will be because she wants to.  Due to Pat&#39;s<br/>\nrecent trip to Asia, however, I now know that 20 C is close to 68 F.  I<br/>\nlearned this because I went on-line to check the weather where he was<br/>\nstaying.  It was in Celsius, so I googled a site to convert that to<br/>\nFahrenheit.  Lisa&#39;s comment to all that?  &quot;Wow, Daddy&#39;s in warm weather and<br/>\nI&#39;m in the snow!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17941,"nextTopicId":17947}}
