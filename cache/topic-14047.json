We joked a lot about it during drives ed.  When I went <br/>\nto take my drivers test and get my lisence I casually remarked to the lady <br/>\nbehind the desk that &quot;Oh, by the way it says I&#39;m male but I&#39;m really not&quot; <br/>\nthinking it would be a simple matter of checking the right box.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was no laughing matter to them and they had to contact the main <br/>\noffice in Olympia and have it changed all legally.

So the next time I got it renewed I was honest and said <br/>\nthat<br/>\nshould be 5&#39;4&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a while I was 5&#39;5&quot; just as surely as if a judge had changed my birth<br/>\nparents.
