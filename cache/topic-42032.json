I luckily felt comfortable enough to tell my friend who woke her mom and called my parents to pick me up.  I didn&#39;t sleep at a friend&#39;s house for a few years after this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about things like this a lot while going to sleep at that age, and it was quite scary.  I don&#39;t know what helped me get through it/over it.  (My 30 yo dh still has thoughts like this late at night that sometimes lead to anxiety attacks, so he prefers to fall asleep with the tv on.  It&#39;s a strategy that helps him avoid these feelings...)  I agree with other posters&#39; recommendations to try and do things like read/watch tv at night that are sleep inducing but can help keep your mind off of scary thoughts.  Also, having my parents available and welcoming if/when I wanted to sleep with them was helpful (which it sounds like your dd has!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no real advice, but just wanted to share my experience.  *I* got through it, and don&#39;t really remember when/how (I was probably back to sleepovers by 13).  I was glad to have my parents&#39; support throughout the process though!

Since then <br/>\nthough he has denied he was ever scared by a film.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needed this for nearly a year. During that time he became more upset about things. It <br/>\nturned out he wanted to be at another school or home educated. I couldn&#39;t handle the idea <br/>\nof home ed, but tried to find another school for him. Eventually I started to home ed him. <br/>\nLots of emotions came out following deregistration. After some months he no longer <br/>\nneeded me there all night, but just until he fell asleep....lots of late nights for me. I <br/>\nredecorated his room and made it more grownup with new furniture. A calm environment. <br/>\nHe gradually spent time in there during the day, until be felt safe about being there at <br/>\nnight too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he progressed to falling asleep by himself while watching youtube on my laptop. <br/>\nVery autonomous, but he was happier. He still likes the light on and my laptop/tv on <br/>\nsilently.

Sometimes we just let him fall asleep in our bed, and <br/>\nthen move him later, because there&#39;s not enough room in our bed for everyone to get a <br/>\ngood night&#39;s sleep.

She felt <br/>\nlike a proper bed was too frightening because monsters live under the <br/>\nbed.  Since we&#39;ve been sleeping on the futon sofa, her fear has moved <br/>\nfrom specifics, particularly monsters, to just a general fear.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; monsters anymore but she feels something that is just <br/>\nplain frightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had a child who&#39;s experienced something similar?  I&#39;d <br/>\nlove some suggestions on what to try next.  We&#39;ve moved her furniture <br/>\naround, added different pieces of furniture, organized more, and <br/>\nchanged the bed.  We aren&#39;t religious though she and I have been <br/>\ntalking a little about energy.  I&#39;m worried there&#39;s simply too much <br/>\nstuff in her room and that the cluttered feel is making for a <br/>\ncluttered energy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42038,"nextTopicId":42061}}
