Last time he  <br/>\nvisited, he had a checklist of eateries he had missed that he wanted  <br/>\nto go to.  This time it&#39;s a list of friends.  So I had a list of  <br/>\npeople who might pick him up from the airport, to give him a head  <br/>\nstart on his planned get-togethers. The first choice&#39;s dad just died  <br/>\n(Kirby&#39;s known the family his whole life) and she didn&#39;t feel ready  <br/>\nto socialize yet.  The next one said yes, but called last night and  <br/>\ncan&#39;t get off work in time, but will come over here right after work  <br/>\nto see him.  The third one will go and take another friend he hangs  <br/>\nout with on Wednesdays, also a friend of Kirby&#39;s, so that&#39;s a two-for- <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose were my choices, not Kirby&#39;s, by the way.  He only knows  <br/>\nsomeone will pick him up.  Holly did it last time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll be here until Monday early evening when he and Holly go to  <br/>\nAustin for his birthday on Tuesday the 29th.  She&#39;ll come back  <br/>\nThursday night she&#39;ll return and Kirby goes back to work Friday after  <br/>\na week off.    It&#39;s cool he has a job he can take time off from (I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how much is paid besides his birthday).   I&#39;m glad Keith  <br/>\ncould afford to give me such a cool gift!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby moved last August and we told him we would save his room for a  <br/>\nyear in case he wanted to come back.  He&#39;s up for a promotion and is  <br/>\nhappy in Austin, so Holly has expanded into his room too.  She had  <br/>\nalready claimed his bathroom the week he left, and now she has put  <br/>\nher bed in what was his bedroom, and her bedroom might become her  <br/>\ncomputer room or storage or she&#39;s not sure what yet.  That&#39;s some  <br/>\nluxury.  She has a suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to do the same for Marty downstairs--to give him the room  <br/>\nbetween his bedroom and the bathroom, but he&#39;s declined.  It&#39;s my  <br/>\noffice currently.  There&#39;s another way to the bathroom (it has two  <br/>\ndoors).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we expand, and Kirby visits twice in a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m all new to this grown-offspring business.  Some of you have lots  <br/>\nof experience.  Maybe you remember being excited by a visit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35721,"nextTopicId":36793}}
