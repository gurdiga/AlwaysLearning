She feels there she<br/>\nhas  a chance to get as good as she can because it is free.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Once again I can mention my son Shawn.  He was a dedicated in  <br/>\ngymnastics, but started late, and was too big. (not like your daughter -  but they still <br/>\nhad him teach) When he started community college he took a  diving class <br/>\nwhich led him into that field.  Thro the years he performed in  a dive show and <br/>\nbecame the national diving champion at his college for two years  running.  <br/>\nSometimes life has a way of taking a person to a different  path.  If it truly is <br/>\ngymnastics I feel you and your family will find a way  to make it happen.  I <br/>\nwish you the best.<br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\nwww.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22822,"nextTopicId":22854}}
