In his conservative, fairly old-fashioned home, was a huge smiling picture of Holly on the fridge with pink hair.  I don&#39;t remember any other pictures of other grandkids, maybe they were there, but Holly was prominent.  It may have been a family picture, from a wedding?, but anyway, the thing that struck me was that he was not ashamed of her pink hair, he had her out for all to see.  I commented on how wonderful she is, and he agreed.  My grandparents, actually my dad&#39;s whole family, are very conservative, the only pictures allowed to be seen are the Sunday-best type, boys in ties and girls in dresses never looking happy.

I remember her talking about some discipline problems she was having with him, and saying something like, &quot;If I don&#39;t get control of him now, what&#39;s going to happen when he&#39;s bigger and heavier than me?&quot; It kind of made sense to me at the time; I was a man-hating radical lesbian feminist and perfectly well-prepared to believe that boys who weren&#39;t shown who the boss was would grow up to push their moms around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I was relaying the story to a friend a year or two later, and she said, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s really f***ed up,&quot; that I realized how f***ed up it was to _assume_ that your child&#39;s default setting was to be an abuser.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think we shape our kids into what we believe kids are. I know so many parents who think discipline is paramount, and when their kids resist being disciplined, they see that as proof that kids need to be disciplined, so they discipline harder, take more away, impose more rules, and the kids resisting those or subverting them is taken as more proof of how much discipline is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas we unschoolers assume the best about our kids. When Eric resists adult direction, we take that to mean he needs more autonomy, and when he give him more autonomy, he responds by being an easier kid to get along with. We never required chores, expecting that kids would want to be part of the family and would help out as and when they were able, and lo and behold, Eric has recently begun really helping with things like unloading groceries, or entertaining his little sister while I cook. And when I thank him, or point out how much it helped, he seems to really like knowing he has done something that meaningfully contributed to the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the mom down the street calls me up to say how out-of-control her daughter is and to ask advice because she has already imposed the strictest punishment she can think of and her daughter still won&#39;t give in, what should she do? When for the last 8 years she&#39;s been controlling everything that poor kid does down to refusing to let her daughter get a different haircut and telling her to eat a grape before she has another bite of cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd friends who spent the last 9 years telling me I needed to discipline Eric more are telling me how much they admire his social skills, and how good he is with his younger siblings, and how much he helped out when he visited their house. (One friend in particular has capitulated--she told me recently, &quot;Eric is a real unschooling success story.&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nKids behave like kids behave. As parents, we have the choice to ascribe positive or negative motivations to them, to look at them judgmentally or lovingly even when they&#39;re being very challenging for us, to contribute to a positive or a negative reinforcing cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Confidence in kindness (long and not happy)","postDate":"1274374973","msgId":54333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCMEU5MkYzLUEwNkItNEJBOC1BQ0JFLTY5RTRFMjBFMEUyOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54342,"prevInTime":54332,"nextInTime":54334,"topicId":54333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Su Penn wrote something in the marriage counseling topic.

If Kirby  <br/>\nhit me, she won. If Kirby didn&#39;t, she lost.<br/>\nI should perhaps mention that she and her husband were Kirby&#39;s  <br/>\ngodparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen and for a couple of years after, that mom used to go and hang out  <br/>\nat the park day where the la leche league playgroup was turning into  <br/>\nan unschooling group as more kids went to school. Her kids could have  <br/>\nmade GREAT unschoolers, and they were friends with my kids, but they  <br/>\nwent to school. She used to come and sit and do needlepoint while we  <br/>\ntalked. She said she might bring her kids home soon, but certainly  <br/>\nthey would never to go middle school! When they could read, she&#39;d  <br/>\nhomeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFive years or so out from the night of the curse, her husband killed  <br/>\nhimself. When he was missing, before they found the body in the shed,  <br/>\nshe called me, twice, to see if I had heard from him. I was, indeed,  <br/>\none of the few people he was likely to have called if he had just left  <br/>\nthe property rather than the whole planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew, but not everyone knew, that the reason he killed himself is  <br/>\nthat his wife had told him she wanted a divorce and he needed to move  <br/>\nout. No matter that it was his house first, and he had done much of  <br/>\nthe work himself. No &quot;let&#39;s fix this,&quot; just &quot;move out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know dozens of stories that could make this clearer, but nothing  <br/>\nwould make it happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the memorial service, at her house. I knew nearly everyone  <br/>\nthere. I observed the interactions among children, between adults. I  <br/>\nsaw her get to play the grieving widow card, and never seem to  <br/>\nconsider the least blame for her children having lost their father.  <br/>\nThey were about to lose him one way or the other, but this way she  <br/>\ncould blame Stan alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that day I decided not to go back, not for 4th of July parties,  <br/>\nnot for Christmas, not for projects. I slipped away. Before I went I  <br/>\ntold some other mutual friends that the situation was toxic and I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to be a part of it any more, that my kids&#39; lives were  <br/>\nhappy and I was going to keep away. I said Stan had died of the  <br/>\ncynicism and pessimism that permeated that whole house, all the time.  <br/>\nPeople couldn&#39;t express a happy thought without others jumping on them  <br/>\nand telling them that they didn&#39;t know what they were talking about,  <br/>\nor that if they thought that was good/nice/funny, then they were stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout five years after the dad died, +/- ten years after the original  <br/>\n&quot;he will hit you,&quot; a friend of ours who knew about it all spoke one  <br/>\nbrief statement to me. I didn&#39;t respond. It was a message that was  <br/>\nbest unresponded to. It was: &quot;Jeff hit Linda.&quot; The mother who assured  <br/>\nme that her childrearing was right and mine would lead to violence had  <br/>\nbeen hit by her son.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had not. Still haven&#39;t. Kirby is 23. Jeff will never be. He died of  <br/>\nan overdose in December. I don&#39;t know if it was accidental, but he had  <br/>\nattempted suicide some time back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis mother didn&#39;t seem very grieved. She said he was just his father&#39;s  <br/>\nson; bad genetics. Somehow she managed to take no responsibility for  <br/>\neither situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one other family&#39;s story and another marriage counselling  <br/>\nresource to share, and then if the moderators want me off the list  <br/>\nI&#39;ll go.

None  <br/>\nof those have to do with privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I decided that wasn&#39;t enough and responded again:<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I am puzzled by the stories you share, Sandra, and wondering if  <br/>\nyou can help me understand why you have shared several stories (very  <br/>\nsad ones!) that are not your own, even including names which I assume  <br/>\nnot to be changed to protect privacy. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-= why you have shared several stories (very sad ones!) that are not  <br/>\nyour own-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI shared one story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis family was intimately involved with mine, and over the years made  <br/>\ndifferent decisions that led to very different results.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m puzzled by people not understanding.   My son&#39;s godmother.  A  <br/>\npromise/curse that my son would grow up to hit me.  Me, called to help  <br/>\nlocate a man who had shot himself.  What part of that is not my story?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own marriage is 25 years, with six years together before that.  Our  <br/>\nchoices went another direction, with a focus on our children&#39;s joy and  <br/>\non creating an unschooling nest for our children.<br/>\n....<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54355,"nextTopicId":54377}}
