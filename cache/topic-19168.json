I believe that <br/>\ntears/upset about one thing really tie in to deep bodily pain.  So crying about the <br/>\nlast cookie falling out the window is possibly really a trigger/access for deeper <br/>\n pain/experiences.  (Have you had the experience of offering another cookie <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t help?!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, through reading NVC and other materials, I&#39;ve tried to develop the <br/>\npractice of simply being with &#39;what is&#39; without fixing it right off.  Sometimes just <br/>\nidentifying the feeling frees it and opens one to healing.  It is a powerful <br/>\nmoment to be with someone who speaks the feeling of pain (fear, sadness, etc) <br/>\nand feels somehow &#39;lighter&#39; by having named the underlying feeling.   There&#39;s <br/>\na connection that can happen - with compassion and understanding, too.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reminding me about the NVC stuff.  I have the little wallet size <br/>\ncards of feelings to help me identify them with myself and others.  I&#39;ll keep <br/>\nthem handy today.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I need to go fix a frozen computer so Magic School Bus Rainforest can be <br/>\nfreed!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19164,"nextTopicId":19170}}
