My older daughter and <br/>\nmy husband are both great at going back and starting over, my younger <br/>\ndaughter and I both really dislike it and prefer not playing at all <br/>\nthan going back over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, when I was playing music a lot and came to a part that I <br/>\nroutinely messed up, I wouldn&#39;t ever go back to the beginning to play <br/>\nit all again, until I had that part right first.  I found that going <br/>\nback tended to make me get sloppy with the beginning all the way up <br/>\nuntil the part the I needed to work on.  It was only after I had <br/>\nsufficiently mastered the part that needed the work, that I was able to <br/>\nplay the piece well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to the beginning may work for some, but certainly not all.  So <br/>\nagain it&#39;s like school, trying to force one way on all the kids and <br/>\ntell them that it&#39;s the way to go and if someone isn&#39;t getting it, it <br/>\nmust be the fault of the child, certainly not the system itself, <br/>\nbecause all kids like video games right?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"words really do count","postDate":"1186539250","msgId":30214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4MDMyRDNFLUM4OTctNDgzNS05N0I2LTYzQTVBQkFENkFBMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30215,"prevInTime":30213,"nextInTime":30215,"topicId":30214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m quoting an article; I ll cite and link it later. ======================================================================= Platform games might as well have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-545050282\">I&#39;m quoting an article; I&#39;ll cite and link it later.<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nPlatform games might as well have been programmed by music teachers -  <br/>\nthe structure is a wish list of practice techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Students are forced to repeat particular sections until they get  <br/>\nthem right.
