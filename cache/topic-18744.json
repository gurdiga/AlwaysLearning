I have no doubt that she supports<br/>\nkid&#39;s own interests and will figure out how to make the paperwork fit.  She<br/>\nshared a story with me about some of her other kids who are in middle<br/>\nschool.  She&#39;s been slowly trying to encourage a child-led process with<br/>\nthis family.

From what I have figured out from my friend, we can pretty much do<br/>\nanything we want to whenever we want to, and she will just make it fit the<br/>\npaperwork after the fact.  We just need to have physical proof that there<br/>\nis a child who is doing &quot;work&quot;, and whatever it happens to be is fine - the<br/>\npaperwork will just sit in her filing cabinet for 3 years and then be<br/>\nthrown out.

She has a<br/>\nfriend who is in school and has learned that teachers tell students what to<br/>\ndo, and she  is completely against this.  She knows my friend because I<br/>\nhave visited with her from time to time.  The fact that my friend is at a<br/>\nschool doesn&#39;t seem to bother my dd.  In fact, she loves to visit; for her<br/>\nit is fun, and we always come home with something fun to play with for<br/>\nawhile.  This may or may not last, but when it&#39;s not fun anymore then we<br/>\nwon&#39;t do it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me explore this and for bringing up some important<br/>\npoints.  For now, I think we&#39;ll try it -- since I know we can leave anytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nciao<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] registering thru school","postDate":"1076369967","msgId":18761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRkLjJmNjNjODMuMmQ1OTc0MmZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":18760,"nextInTopic":18762,"prevInTime":18760,"nextInTime":18762,"topicId":18744,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/9/04 2:37:32 PM, barb@netcetera.com writes: ...

For me, it was math. I have a<br/>\nhard time with numbers and it was forced down my throat and I always<br/>\nfelt really stupid because of it. Never mind I could play the flute like<br/>\na college music major when I was only 13... But Algebra was really<br/>\ntraumatic for me. It&#39;s a big part of why we&#39;ve decided to unschool. What<br/>\nI&#39;m referring to though is the poster&#39;s (sorry, I&#39;m horrible with names)<br/>\nmeetings with the homeschool coordinator that works with the school.<br/>\nWhat is the harm in that person bringing up such subjects in monthly<br/>\nmeetings. Of course if that person starts drilling the child on any<br/>\ngiven subject that&#39;s inappropriate but if it&#39;s just a conversation about<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned... From the stand point of a child who&#39;s never been<br/>\nforce fed a subject wouldn&#39;t it just be another thing to think about<br/>\nrather then the sour memories many of use carry about such subjects?<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe now I&#39;m making it more complicated!

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1879994263\">I have a question that I&#39;d like to pose to this list.  My dd just turned 5,<br/>\nand we are considering registering her thru our local school as a<br/>\nhomeschooler.  I have no interest in &quot;schooling&quot; her, we are unschooling.<br/>\nSo, you might say &quot;why&quot;?  The homeschool coordinator did ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I explained to her this:  she was the person who first introduced me<br/>\nto John Holt and the idea of unschooling (she loaned me quite a collection<br/>\nof his newsletters when my dd was still under a year), over the years I<br/>\nhave learned that she is very much the sort of person who figures out how<br/>\nto &quot;work the system&quot; rather than to follow it.  These two things make me<br/>\nfeel pretty comfortable that she will allow us to unschool and then figure<br/>\nout a way to make it fit within the system.  I am also interested in<br/>\nsupporting our school.  This may sound ridiculous, but we live in a very<br/>\nrural area and although my one daughter&#39;s income to the school is small, it<br/>\nwill help.  I am also interested in helping because we know everyone, and<br/>\nthis would help them.  Finally, by being registered through the school we<br/>\nwill have access to resources and $250 per semester.  Now many of the<br/>\nresources may be &quot;schooly&quot;, and I&#39;m not interested in these unless my dd<br/>\nwants to do it (like the art and music.)  By being a registered student she<br/>\ncan participate, and we can use their library, borrow their audio books,<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing we &quot;have to&quot; do is meet with the coordinator once a month<br/>\n(she is willing to have this be in person, by phone, or even email) and<br/>\nprovide some copies of things that my dd has produced (they need to prove<br/>\nthat she is a real live person - I guess some schools made up homeschoolers<br/>\nfor the extra money.)  She suggested about 4-6 things per month.  So far I<br/>\nhave the feeling that these &quot;have to&quot; will be incredibly negotiable so that<br/>\nwe will really have a choice about what we are doing - even if it means we<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I am hesitant - because it&#39;s not really an unschooling thing to do.<br/>\nI sort of wonder what I haven&#39;t thought of... you know?  With the recent<br/>\nthreads about language, one thing that comes to mind is to stay away from<br/>\nthe &quot;schooly&quot; language when we are working with this person.  If we do meet<br/>\nwith her in person, I sort of think of it as a visit with a friend (which<br/>\nis what it has been all of these years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much like this list&#39;s keen critical examination about this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nps.   BTW, we are in CA so I can easily just do an R4 when she is older.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have to go thru the school.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18772,"nextTopicId":18739}}
