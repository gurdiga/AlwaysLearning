You can live <br/>\na life without &quot;prying&quot; or &quot;gossiping&quot; or sharing, which is like a waterbug <br/>\non the surface of the water.  Is that intimate?  It&#39;s &quot;proper,&quot; and polite, <br/>\nand by the etiquette book.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read 19th century etiquette books, books about how letters should be <br/>\nwritten, examples of period letters from the Renaissance and forward, one of <br/>\nthe main points seems to be NOT to really share.   The liveliest letter <br/>\ncollection I have is Mozart, mostly to his sister,  But he was a hyperactive, <br/>\nidiosyncratic nut.  He wasn&#39;t &quot;proper.&quot;  Proper meant talking about as little <br/>\nas possible.  Leaving calling cards and using form letters out of a book with <br/>\nsamples and examples that many people honestly used to copy word for word.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Hannah left the state years ago. Just this morning I got a letter <br/>\nfrom her about her dad&#39;s sudden death, her feelings for her dad, her <br/>\nmiscarriage (third child) while she was there for the funeral and her thought <br/>\nthat the baby wanted to be with her dad.  And her sex life, her brother&#39;s <br/>\nmove in with her (with wife and child), her neighbor who hosts a republican <br/>\nrally the same weekend on his land each year as he lets the SCA have a big <br/>\ntournament, over the hills, and he takes the Republican fund-raising crowd <br/>\nover there to see the SCA tournament, every year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s some interesting and useful and real stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf my neighboroo much and tell their kids to be quiet all the time.  Across <br/>\nthe cul de sac?  Druggies.  Not too bright.  Not too honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that&#39;s enough for me to know.  (I do know more, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nuplifting, not happy, not an addition to my children&#39;s peace and prosperity.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Is there anything lonelier or more isolated than the typical suburban <br/>\ndweller down on<br/>\ntheir luck? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue in some cases, but there are meetings and churches and for all the <br/>\ncriticism they get, there are social services people, and there are free <br/>\nclasses in most communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re way suburban without transportation THAT can be pretty damned <br/>\nisolating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9484,"nextTopicId":9541}}
