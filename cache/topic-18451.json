Wouldn&#39;t they be saying &quot;Mom, can I join you?&quot;<br/>\nAnd why did the child find something else to do within three minutes if what the mother was doing was interesting?<br/>\nIt sounded like the mother was inviting them to help with her work (fine, in and of itself) and the child was obviously not interested,so found something else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see nothing wrong with a parent inviting the child to help with something, but if it&#39;s housework and the intent is to get a child to quit saying &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; then there are MUCH more compassionate ways to handle this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know households less chaotic than mine, most of them are very controlling. The kids know that certain behavior is off limits and they act in a very docile, obedient manner. Very polite, well-mannered UNTIL the parents aren&#39;t in the vicinity!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when a child says they&#39;re bored, it&#39;s our chance to brainstorm with them. Obviously if I offer to help them think of something and they turn me down, it&#39;s a whole different story. But I&#39;ve never had that happen. My kids don&#39;t get bored very often, and if they do it means &quot;Mom, will you help us think of a cool project to do?&quot;<br/>\nFunny thing is, when I offer a bunch of options they usually come up with their own idea anyway. Sometimes we just need a person to bounce thoughts/feelings off of. I want to be their sounding board, not someone that tries to make them never say &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; like my parents did.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18426,"nextTopicId":18453}}
