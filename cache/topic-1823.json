I read JP and The Lost World years <br/>\nago. I remember that there was a page towards the end of The Lost World that <br/>\nreally struck me. It seemed to me that the entire book, the entire problem <br/>\nwith those damn attacking dinos, was boiling down to the older generation <br/>\nnot being there to care for the younger generation. I remember, at the time, <br/>\nfeeling that it had a strong daycare implication. (Now I&#39;d throw in <br/>\nschooling vs. actually *being* with your children as well.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have the books here to find that page. Anyone else remember it?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1819,"nextTopicId":1820}}
