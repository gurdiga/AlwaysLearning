I happened to catch that airing of 20/20, and<br/>\n&gt; it was an eye-opener. Representatives from an activist<br/>\n&gt; organization called the Environmental Working Group<br/>\n&gt; demonstrated how a Teflon coated pan can easily reach a<br/>\n&gt; temperature of 500 degrees while cooking bacon. At that<br/>\n&gt; temperature, they claim that ultrafine particles may be<br/>\n&gt; released from the pan. And at around 680 degrees, the pan<br/>\n&gt; will begin to emit toxic gases. When inhaled, the gases may<br/>\n&gt; cause a reaction with symptoms that are typical of the flu,<br/>\n&gt; including a temperature several degrees above normal,<br/>\n&gt; chills, headache, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DuPont&#39;s vice president of research and development, Uma<br/>\n&gt; Chowdhry, was interviewed by 20/20, and when asked about the<br/>\n&gt; Teflon flu she admitted that heated Teflon does emit fumes<br/>\n&gt; which can cause a &quot;flu-like symptom, which is reversible.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Somehow that doesn&#39;t put my mind at ease.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And Roz agrees, saying, &quot;... proof has been found that DuPont<br/>\n&gt; has known for a long time of the dangers of Teflon. Well,<br/>\n&gt; that enough for me - out goes the 2 small skillets and 2<br/>\n&gt; small pots I&#39;ve been using. And back to the trusty ole cast-<br/>\n&gt; iron skillets and stainless steel only pots.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This comment prompts a number of responses about different<br/>\n&gt; kinds of cookware, including this caution from Voila: &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; have heard stainless steel is not really recommended either.<br/>\n&gt; It is made with nickel, a highly poisonous substance.&quot; And a<br/>\n&gt; member named Bob adds, &quot;A reminder to everyone not to use<br/>\n&gt; aluminum pots & pans as aluminum is associated with<br/>\n&gt; Alzheimers.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A member named Owen follows Bob&#39;s comment with this<br/>\n&gt; intriguing posting: &quot;Our bodies don&#39;t normally like to store<br/>\n&gt; aluminum compounds in our cells. Aluminum isn&#39;t readily<br/>\n&gt; absorbed -- UNLESS it&#39;s in the presence of fluoride. Put<br/>\n&gt; fluoride and aluminum together in your body, and you&#39;re in<br/>\n&gt; deep trouble. When you cook with fluoridated tap water in an<br/>\n&gt; aluminum pan, you increase the aluminum concentration of<br/>\n&gt; your food by up to 800 times.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These and other more detailed comments about cookware and<br/>\n&gt; Teflon are certainly worth reflecting on as we reheat<br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving leftovers this weekend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A wide variety of health topics are being discussed on the<br/>\n&gt; HSI Forum this week, including omega-3, glycemic index,<br/>\n&gt; mercury tooth fillings, HepA outbreak, burning feet, Epstein<br/>\n&gt; Barr virus, and in a thread titled &quot;Sugar in Cocoa&quot; a member<br/>\n&gt; named Lisa comes to the defense of cocoa with a recipe that<br/>\n&gt; avoids sugar in this winter warmer that has high levels of<br/>\n&gt; antioxidants.
