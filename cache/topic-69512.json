Think about why you want to say no to things, what your reasons and concerns are. At the same time, think about what your kids want and why - take their desires and concerns seriously. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find, doing that, that a great many of your Nos and limits are more automatic than you previously realized. You may find you&#39;re saying &quot;no&quot; when you could say &quot;I don&#39;t know, let me think about it&quot;. You may find you&#39;re saying &quot;not now&quot; when it would be sweeter and gentler to say &quot;yes, as soon as I finish this&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are in school, then chances are they need some time each day to unwind and decompress - and watching tv or playing a video game may be a good way for them to do that. At the same time, as long as they&#39;re in school, their time Is limited - time to do what they enjoy along with time to spend with their parents. You can make that easier on them by spending time With them while they relax - don&#39;t use that time to do your own thing, use it to enjoy their company, see what they like, what interests them. Don&#39;t do it with a wrinkled nose, ready to tell them what&#39;s wrong with their interests! That won&#39;t help you know them better or improve your relationship. Find out what lights them up and makes them smile. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have always been a bit of a stickler on the idea of too much TV, computer, video games.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nI was too, once. It was really shocking to me to discover how much of what I &quot;thought&quot; about all those topics wasn&#39;t really My thoughts at all - they were things &quot;everyone&quot; kind of parrots back and forth as though they were true, with very little real evidence to back them up. It was kind of embarrassing, especially as one of the things I &quot;thought&quot; about tv was that it was a big brainwashing machine. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to read about unschooling kids in general and get a feel for the diversity of interests they have - they&#39;re not all zombie couch potatoes, they&#39;re busy, interesting people.

I appreciate the honesty and true helpfulness of the replies thus far. Excuse me for jumping into a group without first reading the guidelines! I have now done so and will attempt to stay within the list parameter...always learning, right?! My kids do want to be homeschooled, they love the idea of being with me all day and discovering the world together, however they are also happy.  For now I will keep reading, digesting, learning, and discussing.  Joyce is right on about work always being there, but children growing up so quickly, and we cannot take the years back. I already feel like a better mother. Just a bit confused about whether or not I let the kids start without limits on media, etc now? Or just more open and receptive to their wants and ideas? Get away from &quot;no&quot;? I have always been a bit of a stickler on the idea of too much TV, computer, video games.  This will be a very hard adjustment for me to make and accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking on the pro/cons list. I do have a wonderful and very trusted helper with my children who is a natural at the unschooling approach.  She is next to Saintly. I will change my alias, my name is Megan Valnes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- In my heart I feel confident about it, but how do I leave the work force?
