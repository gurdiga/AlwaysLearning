I see the same thing when I look a couple of generations behind me -- a lot of harshness, bitterness, anger, control, fear, estranged relationships, etc.  And up until lately, when I&#39;ve looked in the mirror I&#39;ve seen remnants of it but tried to hide it really well....except my children noticed because I couldn&#39;t hide it 24/7.  I REALLY don&#39;t want to see that anymore.  When I look the other way, I see my children....I see a lot of freedom in the younger ones, and some freedom mixed with some of the other stuff in the older ones.  Hopefully, by the time the older ones start their families (probably within the next decade as the oldest is 17), they will know that I am truely FOR them, BELIEVE in them, LOVE them<br/>\n unconditionally.  The younger ones are eating up their new-found freedom....and loving it.  The older ones seem a little on edge, like wondering when the bomb is going to drop.  I&#39;m sad I created that feeling in them, but hopefully some day soon they will trust me...and hopefully I can remain trustworthy with their feelings and emotions.  Wow, that was more than I intended to say.

As a result of the cultural expectations<br/>\n&gt; (combined with the economy) most young people continue to live at home<br/>\n&gt; throughout their tertiary education (whether university or vocational<br/>\n&gt; studies, neither of which are residential) and often well into their<br/>\n&gt; twenties. Many don&#39;t move out until marriage, and this is seen as<br/>\n&gt; perfectly natural. In fact, until a decade or so ago it was often the<br/>\n&gt; opposite: When my cousin at twenty-six (!) moved out of her parents&#39;<br/>\n&gt; house into a tiny apartment of her own without getting married, there<br/>\n&gt; was some concern among people that first heard about it, that this<br/>\n&gt; meant there have been some sort of problem in the parent-daughter<br/>\n&gt; relationship.

They would raise me until then, but after that, it was my job to support myself. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a freshman in High School, I had a boyfriend named Kevin. He was a senior. We only dated for a month or two. His parents had been telling him for years that the day he graduated he was on his own.  On May 10, a couple weeks before graduation, he shot himself. He died a week later. Thats the worst case scenario.<br/>\nNo, I guess worse is when teens commit violent acts on others, then themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s parents talk A LOT about how when their kids were little, all they could wait for was for them to grow up and move out. Every year, the family joke is that all the parents want for Christmas is peace and quiet. One of his mother&#39;s favorite refrains is &quot;goddamn kids&quot; and she refers to her grandchildren as Indians when they make any noise or run around. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough they did pay for college or similar for all the kids that wanted to pursue it, it was all with strings attached. My husband isnt one to talk about his emotions or the past much, but he has said on occasion how sad it was to feel unwelcome in his childhood home. Even if there was nothing big or dramatic as a result, I believe that all the times his parents said stuff like that, it chipped away and made his life sadder, and made it harder to believe and trust in his future relationships. He often makes jokes on the premise that our children will grow up to hate us, or rebel or sneak out at night, etc. I guess, thats maybe another result...that kind of treatment makes you accept thats just how relationships are with parents and kids. I think if he *really* thought about it, he&#39;d know thats not what he wants to happen. But he often says he wont hope for things or try too hard, just in case it doesnt work out, so he wont be disappointed. I worry<br/>\n sometimes that is going to trump his desire to make our marriage and family happy and successful. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom used to tell me I couldnt come home or stay home sometimes, when she was mad at me. (I was 16, 17)I&#39;d stay at my dad&#39;s or a friend&#39;s. Then she would get mad that I didnt call her to tell her where I was. Before I left for college, my dad told me he wasnt going to be my dad anymore. This is because he caught me stealing quarters from his house. I was stealing them because I hated his guts and was really pissed at hime. I had been working in his office all summer before college. He had told me that if I quit smoking cigarettes, he&#39;d match every penny I saved when I left for school. Behind my back, he told my brother that he had no intention of paying me anything, that it was just to get me to quit smoking and save all my money. So I started smoking again and went to his house to steal his money. He caught me and when I told him my brother had told me my dad&#39;s plan, all he could say was that it wasnt my brothers business to tell me. Oh, and that he<br/>\n wasnt going to be my dad anymore because I never lived up to my potential and kept disappointing him. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents spent a lot of time telling me that I could be anything I wanted, do anything I set my mind to. But what they really meant is that they thought I could achieve what *they* wanted for me. They always said they would be proud as long as I did my best, unfortunately, they never believed I was actually doing my best. It was a classic catch-22 situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I wanted to leave home. I wasnt ready for college and in fact, I dropped out/flunked out/quit, but the alternative was living at home with people who were not kind to me, so I did whatever I had to do to stay away. And that included other bad living situations, bad relationships, bad stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve written alot. But I found out about unschooling when I was pregnant with my first baby. It was a revelation to me. I knew pretty much right away that I had to do what it took to get *there*, to unschooling. To mindful parenting, to respect and trust and love. That I couldnt perpetrate on my children the kind of childhood I&#39;d had. My parents said they loved me, but it never felt like love. I had boyfriends who said they loved me, but were not very nice to me and I never felt their love either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my husband and my kids and I feel their love and I cant and wont do anything to ruin that. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Moving Out","postDate":"1207702830","msgId":34139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNkQ3OUZFLTE4OEUtNEZEQy04NjgxLUU1RjM4MjQ1NTE5MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlGREFEMUQ0LUQwQTUtNERBMy1BMjE1LTY4MTVBNjY4QjcyNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ0ZWtlMytuM2ZwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjAwODA0MDcyMjI3MTkuRFcySVAuMzQzNzMucm9vdEBmZXB3ZWIwMz4gPDkwZjQ4NzU2MDgwNDA4MTY1MHQzMzlkYmJkOXNjOTI1NzhlZmQyZmYzYjc4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8OUZEQUQxRDQtRDBBNS00REEzLUEyMTUtNjgxNUE2NjhCNzI2QG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34138,"nextInTopic":34140,"prevInTime":34138,"nextInTime":34140,"topicId":34102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Holly and I went to Minnesota for a state conference last fall.

I moved out and now I can barely live with them for a weekend. How sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, on the other hand, tell my girls I will always be there for them.  Alexx used to say she was going to move out but only to next house, next door, so she could visit.  Janene, when she was nursing, would say she would never ever move out, but later she said maybe but only if she could come home and nurse every night.  WhenI explained that she probably wouldn&#39;t be nursing when she moved out, she thought I was joking.  Not nursing?  She, of course, thought she&#39;d nurse forever.  (she did wean, and earlier than Alexx).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, I want my children to know they are welcome to live with me until they are ready to move out, just as they were welcome to share my bed and to nurse until they were ready to move on.  And when they do move on, I try to make sure they realize that I will always be here for them, they can always return. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n---- Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ~~I think there is an instinct in people to leave at some point.
