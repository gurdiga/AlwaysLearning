This is what Chamille is all about!  She started with ninja<br/>\nstuff, anime, all of that.  Then she incorporated more blood and more<br/>\ngore and other elements.  She loves anime that is gorey, the more blood,<br/>\nthe better.  Then she added rainbows and blood together.  She sort of<br/>\ntossed the black for neon and rainbows.  Now she&#39;s adding the black with<br/>\nthe neon.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently she&#39;s really into Japanese and Korean horror flicks (if you<br/>\nknow any good ones, let us know!).  Her clothing is inspired by Japanese<br/>\ncounter culture fashion.   She&#39;s working on cyber goth right now.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen making dread locks with tubular crinolin, and we are about to put<br/>\nit into a wig piece.
