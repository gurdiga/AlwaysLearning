Sure. But not by anyone&#39;s advice. Usually by <br/>\ntheir own conscience or in some cases, guilt.

As was said at a  <br/>\nrecent unschooling gathering, it&#39;s not a trick of logic so much as a  <br/>\nbeing at one with. There&#39;s a long list of things that are good to be  <br/>\nat one with. (That&#39;s an idea right there. Jotting down those things.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So to come full circle, unschooling, attachment parenting and other  <br/>\ngreat ideas have led me to feel not that ds is overwhelming me, but  <br/>\nenriching my life in countless ways. There it is. I&#39;m growing more  <br/>\ngratitude, a muscle that hasn&#39;t seen much use until ds. I am so  <br/>\nblessed by a child.-=-<br/>\n================<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy Rush People to Get it?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kinder and gentler would&#39;ve slowed down my learning<br/>\nto the point I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have ever gotten here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPriss wrote that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people say &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy with  <br/>\nunschooling parents,&quot; it&#39;s because of the possibility that they will  <br/>\nrun out of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to  <br/>\nhelp him recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with  <br/>\nhim before he&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it  <br/>\ngradually. If she does, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t  <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading  <br/>\ninstruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to  <br/>\nunschooling, I want to press her to decide it&#39;s &quot;NONE,&quot; because  <br/>\n&quot;some&quot; is damaging to the child&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and  <br/>\ndiscover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; will just hurt that much more. But  <br/>\n&quot;none&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the parent can&#39;t get  <br/>\nunschooling. But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she misses  <br/>\nforever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and  <br/>\nnaturally. It will be gone forever. Forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t say &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re doing is fine, and if  <br/>\nyou want to unschool you can come to it gradually at your own rate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be reading by  <br/>\nthe time he goes on a date&quot; but that can&#39;t be said of unschooling, if  <br/>\nthe parent is attached to thinking she needs to teach things.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from  <br/>\nworking, unschooling can&#39;t begin to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems simple to me.
