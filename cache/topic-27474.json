When they were being schooled, we did what Bill  <br/>\nwants to include as &quot;unschooling,&quot; but I would describe as  <br/>\n&quot;enrichment.&quot; Also, Roya went to a relatively unconventional school  <br/>\nthat had no textbooks or tests or grades, and Roxana was in an even  <br/>\nmore experimental program that allowed tremendous freedom of choice.  <br/>\nSo, they were perhaps &quot;less schooled&quot; than many schooled kids, but it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t unschooling.

I definitely still consider  <br/>\nmy 15 yo to be an unschooler, she is not taking those classes as part  <br/>\nof a &quot;college program of study,&quot; but in the exact same way that she  <br/>\ntakes karate classes at a karate studio or her friend takes dance at  <br/>\na dance studio.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets more tricky when they decide to also add what would be  <br/>\nconsidered college &quot;academic&quot; courses to what they take at the  <br/>\ncommunity college.

They believe that the crux of unschooling is that  <br/>\nlearning is life, that all learning counts, that learning in a  <br/>\nclassroom is not a particularly good way to learn and most definitely  <br/>\nnot where most significant learning occurs.

Even if <br/>\nthey take school on their own terms, they are choosing that life over an <br/>\nunschooled life. And while I love being an unschooling family, it isn&#39;t more <br/>\nessential that I be able to define myself as such than that Simon and <br/>\nLinnaea get to live the lives they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bill Ellis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tranet@...\">tranet@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 01, 1970 2:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling from school<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  ... .
