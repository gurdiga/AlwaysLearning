I am<br/>\ntalking about SEVERE neglect or abuse (no food for days, no home to live<br/>\nin, no utilities in the home, filthy conditions that do not get cleaned up,<br/>\neven after multiple services to help fix it, no medical care, no education,<br/>\netc) that directly affects the child in a harmful way; NOT emotionally, but<br/>\nphysically in a very measurable way.  In other words, some sort of harm has<br/>\nto have been done.  A person has a constitutional right to a relationship<br/>\nwith their parent or child.  A person also has a constitutional right to<br/>\nraise (or mess up, depending on who is looking at the situation) their own<br/>\nchild as they see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the fact that this child&#39;s reality is that her father is an<br/>\nalcoholic.  No one can change that, and she can only be protected from that<br/>\nreality in a limited way.  The BEST tactic is what I call measured<br/>\nhonesty.  The healthy parent (or parental figure) provides the child with<br/>\nas much information about the situation as the child is able and ready to<br/>\ncope with.  Helping the child to express her feelings about the various<br/>\nsituations that will arise in a place of safety and acceptance and<br/>\nproviding guidance on how to cope with those feelings in positive ways.<br/>\nThings like,&quot;It is okay to be angry, but it isn&#39;t okay to throw things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the common metaphors about addiction is that it is like there is an<br/>\nelephant in the living room, but everybody is ignoring it.  If you<br/>\nacknowledge that the elephant is there, you can at least move the beasty<br/>\ninto the back yard where it is easier to cope...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this situation, the problematic parent is at least put together enough<br/>\nto respect his child&#39;s wishes.  Children who grow up in these situations<br/>\n(she has 7 years experience dealing with an alcoholic) usually develop an<br/>\nuncanny ability to read situations.  I am not saying that a 7 year old<br/>\nshould be left to fend for herself in all situations, but it is valuable to<br/>\nlisten to her and respect her assessment of the issues.  She has already<br/>\ndemonstrated a very mature sense of self worth and self preservation by<br/>\ndeciding not to visit with her dad overnight.  Given this fact, I think<br/>\nthat she has proven that she is capable of having a lot of input into her<br/>\nvisitation.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dealing with Alcoholism","postDate":"1322533011","msgId":63961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE3RTQ2QUVCLTAxMEYtNDA1Qy04REUxLTYyQjkzRTQ0NzM5OEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3QTc5MTM0LTJDRTQtNDM3MS1CMDU3LTYyQzdBRENFMUMwMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpiMGxwbStkODVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjdBNzkxMzQtMkNFNC00MzcxLUIwNTctNjJDN0FEQ0UxQzAwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63954,"nextInTopic":63968,"prevInTime":63960,"nextInTime":63962,"topicId":63893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think you re projecting the reactions of a child who depends on an addicted parent for their basic needs onto any child in any relationship with an alcoholic","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-618697888\">I think you&#39;re projecting the reactions of a child who depends on an  <br/>\naddicted parent for their basic needs onto any child in any  <br/>\nrelationship with an alcoholic parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Whether unschooled or not, the addiction makes a huge difference in  <br/>\n&gt; what the child will or won&#39;t say or lie about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is true even without addiction in the mix.

I also worked with more addicts than I can count<br/>\n&gt; and had a bunch of addicts in my family.  Most of the addicts that I was<br/>\n&gt; related to are now dead, mostly due to complications that come with the<br/>\n&gt; various addictions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So here are some facts as I have learned them:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Alcohol withdrawal can kill a healthy person.  If he has been drinking<br/>\n&gt; nearly every day or (more probably) every day, and now has diabetes then he<br/>\n&gt; is probably doing what Alcoholics Anonymous veterans call &quot;drinking to be<br/>\n&gt; normal&quot;.  He actually needs alcohol to function now. His physiology has so<br/>\n&gt; adapted to alcohol that the only safe way for him to really quit would be<br/>\n&gt; in a hospital under medical supervision.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alcohol withdrawal is the only withdrawal process that has a high<br/>\n&gt; probability of being fatal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So basically, him claiming not to drink before and during the visits with<br/>\n&gt; his daughter are, more likely than not, a lie.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Which brings me to the next point, addicts LIE.  They can&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; themselves, they can&#39;t even be honest with themselves.  Recovery jargon<br/>\n&gt; calls it, &quot;Swimming in the biggest river in the world--da&#39; Nile (denial)&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Along with denial comes a rejection of personal responsibility for their<br/>\n&gt; life and problems.  An addict is always a victim of circumstances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the most frustrating and most obvious marks of addiction is<br/>\n&gt; denial-of being an addict, of having any problem, of their substance<br/>\n&gt; use/abuse being a problem.  As part of the addiction process, addicts<br/>\n&gt; become amazingly good liars because they actually believe what they are<br/>\n&gt; telling you (and themselves).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Children who spend any time with an alcoholic parent become very adept<br/>\n&gt; at gauging a person&#39;s sobriety and truthfulness.  They can also grow to<br/>\n&gt; have issues with trust and truthfulness themselves.  If this is the case,<br/>\n&gt; call her on any &#39;fibs&#39; that she tells, but be supportive and discuss why<br/>\n&gt; she felt she couldn&#39;t tell you the truth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your daughter can probably describe her father&#39;s drinking behavior and the<br/>\n&gt; effects of the alcohol very well.  One of the smartest things that you have<br/>\n&gt; done is to NOT deny that her father has a problem.  Children have an<br/>\n&gt; uncanny sense of bullsh*t and she needs to be able to trust you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your daughter probably loves her father for who he is, helping her<br/>\n&gt; understand that he is broken and can only be so reliable is your best bet.<br/>\n&gt; You will have to find a delicate balance between placing your daughter in a<br/>\n&gt; role of taking care of her father or enabling him and allowing her to<br/>\n&gt; experience her personal reality of having an alcoholic parent.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; protect her from her reality, you can only help her to cope with her<br/>\n&gt; situation.  Empower her to set limits that are for her benefit.  Make it<br/>\n&gt; clear that she is the first priority, not her dad&#39;s feelings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Discuss your concerns with her if she wants to stay overnight with her dad<br/>\n&gt; without any one else there as a safety net.  The idea of a phone is a good<br/>\n&gt; one.  Talking about 911 and when to call is also not a bad idea.<br/>\n&gt; Attempting to cut off visits could result in your daughter feeling that she<br/>\n&gt; has to protect her father and their relationship from you.  I think you<br/>\n&gt; have been wise to respect her feelings about visits.  But if their seems to<br/>\n&gt; be a dangerous situation that she is not picking up on, I would definitely<br/>\n&gt; pull her aside and talk to her about why I feel like a visit at that time<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t a good idea.  Stress her well being and safety.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, don&#39;t call him &#39;sick&#39; or some other euphemism; drinking problem,<br/>\n&gt; thinking problem, or problem are all good options.  That way, when he is<br/>\n&gt; actually sick with a physical ailment (like diabetes), and he will be, it<br/>\n&gt; will be clear that he is physically sick.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would definitely suggest connecting with ACOA, or alanon for information<br/>\n&gt; and support.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may also consider speaking to your daughter&#39;s father and tell him that<br/>\n&gt; he will die an early death and leave his daughter without a father if he<br/>\n&gt; does not get help.  Especially with diabetes.  He will probably not listen,<br/>\n&gt; but it is worth a try.  But the bulk of your concern should be getting<br/>\n&gt; information so that you can answer your daughter&#39;s questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4. Addiction is progressive.  If an addict does not get help then the<br/>\n&gt; addiction and the behaviors of the addict will get worse.  If an addict<br/>\n&gt; gets some help, then know that relapse is a part of the recovery process.<br/>\n&gt; It usually takes several attempts before recovery really sets in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, an addict that abstains and doesn&#39;t get therapy and support to<br/>\n&gt; address the issues that helped the addiction develop (an alcoholic is a<br/>\n&gt; drunk because they drink) as well as the issues that came from the<br/>\n&gt; addiction will just be an addict that isn&#39;t using.  Their relationships and<br/>\n&gt; how they navigate life will not change much and they will only be<br/>\n&gt; moderately more healthy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your child notices that the addicted parent has been abstaining, try to<br/>\n&gt; not let them set too much store on the good news.  Try to gently explain<br/>\n&gt; that using one time means going back to the beginning and that it is very<br/>\n&gt; easy to use and very hard to stay clean.  This is where knowledge is<br/>\n&gt; important.  When AA says &#39;one day at a time&#39;, they mean it.  Sometimes it<br/>\n&gt; is one hour, one minute at a time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The final thing I want to address is that there is some evidence that there<br/>\n&gt; is a genetic basis for becoming an addict.  It is not destiny, but it is<br/>\n&gt; important that you get information about substance use and abuse and how<br/>\n&gt; addiction works and how it can be prevented.  Then, share honest<br/>\n&gt; information with your daughter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband and I started when our children were very young, (4 or 5)<br/>\n&gt; talking about drug use and abuse.  Most of the addicts that I have known<br/>\n&gt; actually used for the first time when they were around 10 years old.  We<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t and don&#39;t condemn substance use (which includes all addictive<br/>\n&gt; substances including nicotine and caffeine, as well as prescription drugs),<br/>\n&gt; but we talk about choices and consequences of our choices.  We don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; our children believing that substance use is all or nothing.  Some drugs<br/>\n&gt; can be very good for us if we need them, but can be very bad if we overuse<br/>\n&gt; them, vitamins and tylenol are two examples that I use often.  Some drugs<br/>\n&gt; are almost never good for you to use, nicotine and alcohol are two that I<br/>\n&gt; have talked about as an example of these.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope that this isn&#39;t too much information and I hope that it helps.<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, Nov 26, 2011 at 10:30 AM, Laura Oliver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;learn.love.laugh@...&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My 7 yo daughter&#39;s father and I are not together, and we have not been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since she was an infant. We were never married, and my daughter and I moved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out when she was 4 months old due to his alcoholism and temper. Since then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she has seen him regularly (once a week) and he has helped to support her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; financially. We have worked out a verbal agreement of visitation and child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; support and have not had to involve the state. He has also agreed not to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drink in her presence. He has a history of bad decisions and accidents when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drinking (2 DUI&#39;s, damaged friends property, injury to himself), and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; demanded that if she were to spend the night there, he abstain from alcohol<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before and during her visit. He was diagnosed with Diabetes last year and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been quite sick on and off since then. Shortly after he was diagnosed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he was very drunk when I picked her up one afternoon. I was furious. When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally got to talk to him alone 2 days later, I told him I didn&#39;t want him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have unsupervised visits with her anymore. because I was concerned about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her safety. I also do not want her to be in a situation where she has to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; call 911 because her father has passed out. He decided to quit drinking, at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least that is what he told me. After a while, I let her sleepover again. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had not discussed her father&#39;s alcoholism with my daughter, because I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to put my judgmental ideas about him in her mind. A few weeks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ago she told me she didn&#39;t want to sleepover at his house anymore because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he drinks too much and she doesn&#39;t feel respected at his house. She told me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about a couple of incidents where he got very angry and wanted her to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something she was uncomfortable with (ride in a car with him after he got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in a fight with his girlfriend, and let the girlfriend tickle her). At that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point I told her quite a bit about her dad and my history together, why I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; left, our agreements, etc. She asked me to tell him she decided not to stay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there anymore. I told him, and he said he never meant to make her feel that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way and had some things to work on. Two weeks went by, and he called and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asked to take her out to lunch. They spent the afternoon together, with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family that was visiting for the Thanksgiving week. When I went to pick her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up, she said she wanted to sleepover at dad&#39;s (one of her 10 yo family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; members was staying for the week). I let her stay, because it seemed like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what she really wanted and because I felt a little better knowing there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were other adults around. Well that was a week ago. She has been with them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ever since. They took a planned trip to NYC for Thanksgiving and are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traveling home today. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m looking for advice. If she wants to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; continue sleepovers when family is not visiting, do I allow it? I try not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to control her, just support her decisions, but what about in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation? I&#39;m genuinely worried about her mental and physical safety when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he is drinking. I can not control his drinking, and do not believe he will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; voluntarily abstain in her presence. Do I stop her from staying there when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she wants to? Most friends I talk to do not truly understand unschooling or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my attempts at a non-coercive relationship with my daughter. It is hard to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listen to their advice with an open mind, because I feel that they think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be more controlling about most of her choices.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dealing with Alcoholism OT","postDate":"1322434040","msgId":63927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDMTdBREEyLTNGMjYtNEFEMy05ODFDLThCNDQwNTMwNzJEQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGphdWUxMSt1MWluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGphdWUxMSt1MWluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63926,"nextInTopic":63947,"prevInTime":63926,"nextInTime":63928,"topicId":63893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Do you mind if I cut and paste this as my staus on facebook.

His physiology has so<br/>\nadapted to alcohol that the only safe way for him to really quit would be<br/>\nin a hospital under medical supervision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlcohol withdrawal is the only withdrawal process that has a high<br/>\nprobability of being fatal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically, him claiming not to drink before and during the visits with<br/>\nhis daughter are, more likely than not, a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Which brings me to the next point, addicts LIE.  They can&#39;t help<br/>\nthemselves, they can&#39;t even be honest with themselves.  Recovery jargon<br/>\ncalls it, &quot;Swimming in the biggest river in the world--da&#39; Nile (denial)&quot;.<br/>\nAlong with denial comes a rejection of personal responsibility for their<br/>\nlife and problems.  An addict is always a victim of circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most frustrating and most obvious marks of addiction is<br/>\ndenial-of being an addict, of having any problem, of their substance<br/>\nuse/abuse being a problem.  As part of the addiction process, addicts<br/>\nbecome amazingly good liars because they actually believe what they are<br/>\ntelling you (and themselves).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Children who spend any time with an alcoholic parent become very adept<br/>\nat gauging a person&#39;s sobriety and truthfulness.  They can also grow to<br/>\nhave issues with trust and truthfulness themselves.  If this is the case,<br/>\ncall her on any &#39;fibs&#39; that she tells, but be supportive and discuss why<br/>\nshe felt she couldn&#39;t tell you the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter can probably describe her father&#39;s drinking behavior and the<br/>\neffects of the alcohol very well.  One of the smartest things that you have<br/>\ndone is to NOT deny that her father has a problem.  Children have an<br/>\nuncanny sense of bullsh*t and she needs to be able to trust you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter probably loves her father for who he is, helping her<br/>\nunderstand that he is broken and can only be so reliable is your best bet.<br/>\nYou will have to find a delicate balance between placing your daughter in a<br/>\nrole of taking care of her father or enabling him and allowing her to<br/>\nexperience her personal reality of having an alcoholic parent.  You can&#39;t<br/>\nprotect her from her reality, you can only help her to cope with her<br/>\nsituation.  Empower her to set limits that are for her benefit.  Make it<br/>\nclear that she is the first priority, not her dad&#39;s feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscuss your concerns with her if she wants to stay overnight with her dad<br/>\nwithout any one else there as a safety net.  The idea of a phone is a good<br/>\none.  Talking about 911 and when to call is also not a bad idea.<br/>\nAttempting to cut off visits could result in your daughter feeling that she<br/>\nhas to protect her father and their relationship from you.  I think you<br/>\nhave been wise to respect her feelings about visits.  But if their seems to<br/>\nbe a dangerous situation that she is not picking up on, I would definitely<br/>\npull her aside and talk to her about why I feel like a visit at that time<br/>\nisn&#39;t a good idea.  Stress her well being and safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t call him &#39;sick&#39; or some other euphemism; drinking problem,<br/>\nthinking problem, or problem are all good options.  That way, when he is<br/>\nactually sick with a physical ailment (like diabetes), and he will be, it<br/>\nwill be clear that he is physically sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would definitely suggest connecting with ACOA, or alanon for information<br/>\nand support.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also consider speaking to your daughter&#39;s father and tell him that<br/>\nhe will die an early death and leave his daughter without a father if he<br/>\ndoes not get help.  Especially with diabetes.  He will probably not listen,<br/>\nbut it is worth a try.  But the bulk of your concern should be getting<br/>\ninformation so that you can answer your daughter&#39;s questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Addiction is progressive.  If an addict does not get help then the<br/>\naddiction and the behaviors of the addict will get worse.  If an addict<br/>\ngets some help, then know that relapse is a part of the recovery process.<br/>\nIt usually takes several attempts before recovery really sets in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, an addict that abstains and doesn&#39;t get therapy and support to<br/>\naddress the issues that helped the addiction develop (an alcoholic is a<br/>\ndrunk because they drink) as well as the issues that came from the<br/>\naddiction will just be an addict that isn&#39;t using.  Their relationships and<br/>\nhow they navigate life will not change much and they will only be<br/>\nmoderately more healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child notices that the addicted parent has been abstaining, try to<br/>\nnot let them set too much store on the good news.  Try to gently explain<br/>\nthat using one time means going back to the beginning and that it is very<br/>\neasy to use and very hard to stay clean.  This is where knowledge is<br/>\nimportant.  When AA says &#39;one day at a time&#39;, they mean it.  Sometimes it<br/>\nis one hour, one minute at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final thing I want to address is that there is some evidence that there<br/>\nis a genetic basis for becoming an addict.  It is not destiny, but it is<br/>\nimportant that you get information about substance use and abuse and how<br/>\naddiction works and how it can be prevented.  Then, share honest<br/>\ninformation with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I started when our children were very young, (4 or 5)<br/>\ntalking about drug use and abuse.  Most of the addicts that I have known<br/>\nactually used for the first time when they were around 10 years old.  We<br/>\ndidn&#39;t and don&#39;t condemn substance use (which includes all addictive<br/>\nsubstances including nicotine and caffeine, as well as prescription drugs),<br/>\nbut we talk about choices and consequences of our choices.  We don&#39;t want<br/>\nour children believing that substance use is all or nothing.  Some drugs<br/>\ncan be very good for us if we need them, but can be very bad if we overuse<br/>\nthem, vitamins and tylenol are two examples that I use often.  Some drugs<br/>\nare almost never good for you to use, nicotine and alcohol are two that I<br/>\nhave talked about as an example of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this isn&#39;t too much information and I hope that it helps.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, Nov 26, 2011 at 10:30 AM, Laura Oliver<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:learn.love.laugh@...\">learn.love.laugh@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 7 yo daughter&#39;s father and I are not together, and we have not been<br/>\n&gt; since she was an infant. We were never married, and my daughter and I moved<br/>\n&gt; out when she was 4 months old due to his alcoholism and temper. Since then<br/>\n&gt; she has seen him regularly (once a week) and he has helped to support her<br/>\n&gt; financially. We have worked out a verbal agreement of visitation and child<br/>\n&gt; support and have not had to involve the state. He has also agreed not to<br/>\n&gt; drink in her presence. He has a history of bad decisions and accidents when<br/>\n&gt; drinking (2 DUI&#39;s, damaged friends property, injury to himself), and I<br/>\n&gt; demanded that if she were to spend the night there, he abstain from alcohol<br/>\n&gt; before and during her visit. He was diagnosed with Diabetes last year and<br/>\n&gt; has been quite sick on and off since then. Shortly after he was diagnosed,<br/>\n&gt; he was very drunk when I picked her up one afternoon. I was furious. When I<br/>\n&gt; finally got to talk to him alone 2 days later, I told him I didn&#39;t want him<br/>\n&gt; to have unsupervised visits with her anymore. because I was concerned about<br/>\n&gt; her safety. I also do not want her to be in a situation where she has to<br/>\n&gt; call 911 because her father has passed out. He decided to quit drinking, at<br/>\n&gt; least that is what he told me. After a while, I let her sleepover again. I<br/>\n&gt; had not discussed her father&#39;s alcoholism with my daughter, because I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to put my judgmental ideas about him in her mind. A few weeks<br/>\n&gt; ago she told me she didn&#39;t want to sleepover at his house anymore because<br/>\n&gt; he drinks too much and she doesn&#39;t feel respected at his house. She told me<br/>\n&gt; about a couple of incidents where he got very angry and wanted her to<br/>\n&gt; something she was uncomfortable with (ride in a car with him after he got<br/>\n&gt; in a fight with his girlfriend, and let the girlfriend tickle her). At that<br/>\n&gt; point I told her quite a bit about her dad and my history together, why I<br/>\n&gt; left, our agreements, etc. She asked me to tell him she decided not to stay<br/>\n&gt; there anymore. I told him, and he said he never meant to make her feel that<br/>\n&gt; way and had some things to work on. Two weeks went by, and he called and<br/>\n&gt; asked to take her out to lunch. They spent the afternoon together, with<br/>\n&gt; family that was visiting for the Thanksgiving week. When I went to pick her<br/>\n&gt; up, she said she wanted to sleepover at dad&#39;s (one of her 10 yo family<br/>\n&gt; members was staying for the week). I let her stay, because it seemed like<br/>\n&gt; what she really wanted and because I felt a little better knowing there<br/>\n&gt; were other adults around. Well that was a week ago. She has been with them<br/>\n&gt; ever since. They took a planned trip to NYC for Thanksgiving and are<br/>\n&gt; traveling home today. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m looking for advice. If she wants to<br/>\n&gt; continue sleepovers when family is not visiting, do I allow it? I try not<br/>\n&gt; to control her, just support her decisions, but what about in this<br/>\n&gt; situation? I&#39;m genuinely worried about her mental and physical safety when<br/>\n&gt; he is drinking. I can not control his drinking, and do not believe he will<br/>\n&gt; voluntarily abstain in her presence. Do I stop her from staying there when<br/>\n&gt; she wants to? Most friends I talk to do not truly understand unschooling or<br/>\n&gt; my attempts at a non-coercive relationship with my daughter. It is hard to<br/>\n&gt; listen to their advice with an open mind, because I feel that they think I<br/>\n&gt; should be more controlling about most of her choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":437833022,"authorName":"nicolaphillips88","from":"&quot;nicolaphillips88&quot; &lt;nicolaphillips88@...&gt;","profile":"nicolaphillips88","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Dealing with Alcoholism","postDate":"1322351864","msgId":63904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGphcnVkbys2dWozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGphcjlwbit1NWprQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63903,"nextInTopic":63905,"prevInTime":63903,"nextInTime":63905,"topicId":63893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My Dad was / is an alcholic (my parents split over it ) totally agree with the mobile phone idea. your child could need a DR what if he is too drunk to notice","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-460526028\">My Dad was / is an alcholic (my parents split over it ) <br/>\n<br/>\n totally agree with the mobile phone idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nyour child could need a DR what if he is too drunk to notice or get her to a DR . ... ? ? <br/>\n<br/>\nmy dad was good as making us feeling guilty, making us spend more time with him than i really wanted- <br/>\n<br/>\ni think having a code word - for situations like -Dad wants me to stay , i dont want to, but feel i should say im happy bout staying infront of him ...  wish i had that with my mum. was only when i was 15 when i said to mum how i felt - she had NO IDEA. coz i was saying yes ok but really ment, i feel i have to say yes but i dont want to - dad makes me feel i need to say i want to say. <br/>\n<br/>\ni dont feel any child is safe, staying with an alcholic . father or not.

And sometimes parents abduct children when they can&#39;t have custody - that&#39;s the Most Common child abduction scenario. If you&#39;re dealing with an unpredictable biological parent, one you know lies about Big Things, that in and of itself makes for some sleepless nights - what&#39;s More scary? What&#39;s More dangerous? A day with the other parent? Or the other parent running off with the kid?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t think letting a 7 year old make judgment calls on what is safe is a great idea.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on the 7yo and the judgement calls. This particular 7yo has experience dealing with an alcoholic father and knows she doesn&#39;t like to be around him when he&#39;s drunk - so she Is capable of making That particular judgement call. The problem is she&#39;s 7 and can&#39;t necessarily Do anything about that judgement call without another adult&#39;s direct intervention. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is No Way of knowing if dad has cleaned up. He might have! It might be perfectly safe for his daughter to stay over at his place regularly from now on and they could build a lovely relationship. More likely it will be an on-again-off-again thing with dad sometimes sober and lovely and sometimes an ass. It&#39;s easy to say mom should have thought of that seven years ago and made a different decision, but this is what she&#39;s working with now: how to help a child who is inextricably tied up with an alcoholic father and will be even if she&#39;s not allowed to visit him because she already loves him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Some things we as adults know from experience,  wouldn&#39;t it be nice if our kids didn&#39;t have to go thru the same unpleasantness, if we can protect them, why not.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to protect a child from a biological parent they love? That&#39;s hard. It&#39;s especially hard when one parent is saying &quot;daddy is sick&quot; and the other is saying &quot;mommy is wrong, I love you.&quot; That&#39;s unpleasant enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news, such as it is, is that this little girl already Knows daddy is sick - or at least she knows what he looks like drunk and knows she doesn&#39;t want to be around it. Mom doesn&#39;t have to dance around the truth, she can say &quot;I&#39;m worried he&#39;ll be drunk&quot; and go from there. But where to go from there may be hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe. Maybe the girl won&#39;t want to stay with dad unless there are other people around to keep him on the straight and narrow. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dealing with Alcoholism","postDate":"1322342477","msgId":63899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdDOEYxQjQyLUQ3RDktNEE5Ri05RURFLUIyMTQ4RDM5NkIwMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGphcmJqcyszaDVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGphcmJqcyszaDVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63898,"nextInTopic":63900,"prevInTime":63898,"nextInTime":63900,"topicId":63893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m curious, why do some unschooling parents feel that they shouldn t protect their kids from dangerous or scary situations in life.-=- This is not asked in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-576612601\">-=-I&#39;m curious, why do some unschooling parents feel that they shouldn&#39;t protect their kids from dangerous or scary situations in life.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not asked in such a way that you can get a good answer.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there is ANY unschooling parent who would say &quot;I don&#39;t want to protect my kid from danger or from scary situations.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I wouldn&#39;t think letting a 7 year old make judgment calls on what is safe is a great idea. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, you&#39;ve worded this in a way that doesn&#39;t allow any other thoughts.<br/>\nBecause you wrote it that way, it indicates that you thought of it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question wasn&#39;t &quot;Do you think this is safe?&quot; in advance.

I&#39;m genuinely worried about her mental and physical safety when he is drinking.  I can not control his drinking, and do not believe he will voluntarily abstain in her presence.  Do I stop her from staying there when she wants to?  Most friends I talk to do not truly understand unschooling or my attempts at a non-coercive relationship with my daughter.  It is hard to listen to their advice with an open mind, because I feel that they think I should be more controlling about most of her choices.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64025,"nextTopicId":64078}}
