I have been thinking and reading and have been able to relax a lot about both the problems, for now.   The next movie we are renting from Netflix is the Brandy Cinderella one, and I am thinking about how to expand the diversity of our social circle as well.  Right now the only other Black people we hang out with regularly are my sister and her family.  So far Nisa has not asked me questions about race and I will just wait for it to come up naturally.  I am also working on not overreacting when she is eating dirt and gently stopping her or redirecting without too much comment.  I loved all the ideas about seeing that she may have a need that is being filled by eating dirt, and finding ways to try and meet it in more acceptable ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia Koltai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;LydiaK&quot; &lt;princessjasmine05@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have two issues I have been trying to deal with for a little while now unsuccessfully.  One is that my four year old daughter, Nisa, loves blonde hair and white skin.  I am Black and my husband is Jewish (White, but he likes to say Jewish).  Nisa has fairly light skin and dark hair.  She loves the Barbie movies and we have watched nearly every one together.  I love many of them too, which is surprising because I didn&#39;t like Barbie much as a kid.  Since getting into Barbie, Nisa has started saying that she wishes she had white skin and blonde hair almost every day.  Today we were playing with shaving cream and water beads, and she rubbed the shaving cream on her arms and told me she now had white skin and was very happy about it.  I lightly said &quot;I liked your skin before.&quot;  When she asked why, I said because she had skin that was a mix between mine and her dad&#39;s.  I asked her what she thought of my skin and she said &quot;Well I think it&#39;s kind of ugly.&quot;  That hurt my feelings.  I didn&#39;t say that to her, because I thought I might have been too emotionally charged and discounting her preferences in initiating that conversation to begin with, although I tried to stay as neutral as possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having a daughter who wishes to be whiter has been triggering me in lots of ways.  We haven&#39;t talked to her about race or history, although we do live in the South.  As a kid, my parents talked to me LOTS about race and history, slavery, Jim Crow, and their own experiences etc.; and I don&#39;t want to do that with her in the same way because it made me feel very angry at a young age.  My sister and I also went to a private school from 3rd-10th grade where we were the first Black students to attend (it was a school that was established in response to forced integration in 1969).  It was very uncomfortable, and we were brought into the principal&#39;s office to talk about our race and how some students might treat us unkindly when we started school there.  I was always on the lookout and on the defensive after that.  So I am not sure that is a great approach.  There were some incidents but in retrospect I wonder if they would have been easier to handle if I had been helped in gentler ways.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my family growing up, if I had expressed the preferences Nisa has, my parents would have ridiculed me.  My parents also often told us not to trust our White friends at school because they would eventually betray us.  I think it might have been kinder to wait until there was an actual issue and then discuss it in that context than to set us up to be looking for those kinds of things.  I could never really relax at that school and was glad when I left.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I might be tacking too much significance to her preferences, but I feel like she has learned from watching Barbie that having brown skin isn&#39;t as beautiful or as preferable as white skin.  That she has somehow absorbed these messages from our culture, as depicted by Barbie.  Then again, maybe it is as simple as she is identifying with a character she likes.  I don&#39;t know.  She had been asking me for a blonde wig for months and I did buy her one to play dress up in at home.  I was happy to give it to her and to see her joy at having it.  It really is no different than having a princess dress and pretending to be a princess, but my baggage keeps me from feeling that way sometimes.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the one hand, I would like my daughter to get to just be a kid.  I don&#39;t want to burden her with too much information or political and social justice issues.  I just don&#39;t really know what is an appropriate way to deal with discussing race and identity with her, or if it is appropriate right now.  Or how to discuss that beauty isn&#39;t only white skin and blonde hair, when that is her current model of beauty.  Or how to deal with my own issues and not pass them along to her.  I do think Barbie in the movies is beautiful and has many admirable qualities; but I wish my daughter thought of herself as beautiful just as she is!  She really is a beautiful girl.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other issue is how to deal with situations where my children are doing things that are socially unacceptable.  This has come up several times on this list recently, and has been on my mind for a while as well.  My biggest problem is that Nisa likes to eat dirt and sand.  She will gleefully do it more if I tell her not to.  She often shoves handfuls into her mouth before we go somewhere (while we are outside in the driveway about to get in the car), and sometimes when she is at the park or something like that.  I tell her to stop firmly and take her hand from her mouth and clean her up.  It is mortifying.  I believe if people see her eating dirt, it will cause problems for our family.  I don&#39;t understand why she does this; when I ask her she says because it tastes good.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband thinks Nisa&#39;s public dirt eating is no big deal.  Just a couple of weeks ago, he took her to a neighbor&#39;s house to see some horses, and I wasn&#39;t there.  He told me she was eating dirt from the driveway in front of the neighbor, whom we had just met that day; and that the neighbor said she should go back to our house and eat our dirt, expressing his discomfort.  Maybe he was not that uncomfortable, I don&#39;t know because I wasn&#39;t there, but I imagine he was.  My husband said he just laughed and did not stop her.  She also picks her nose in public and I have told her that is impolite and I have also said &quot;other people don&#39;t like to see that&quot; and other short, informative phrases like that.  I have also sometimes talked too much.  She still does it; when I see her do it, I take her hand from her nose and often she will just go right back to doing it.  I will offer her a tissue or a trip to the bathroom but she doesn&#39;t take me up on those often.  Sometimes, with the dirt eating, I wonder if there is a deeper reason she is doing this--sometimes she will look right at me when she is doing it, like she wants to get my reaction, which is usually pretty horrified, especially if we are in public.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband, I should mention, frequently does not pick up on social cues.  His father is the same way.  So there could be a genetic predisposition, or it could be normal four year old behavior, or she could be feeling defiant in which case I need to figure out why . . . .  Those are my main theories at the moment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suppose I should be calmer in my response, but continue to stop her from doing these things.  Maybe I will have to keep stopping her over and over.  But it seems to me that I am doing something wrong here.  If I was doing this right, my daughter would be trusting me and not continuing to do something that is inappropriate.  So far that is not happening.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lydia Koltai<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1333027490","msgId":66484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFQkE2MjA5LTUwNUYtNEZBMi1BRjAwLUE4RDNBMDRDRUYyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5NjMwRUFGLTk1QUYtNDY5RC04QzlBLTMyMDc5OURBMkIzM0B5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGpraDFhdCttazluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8amtwcWhoK2RmcThAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxDQUtMc1dZNXErNHY5dnF0RHdOWEVfay1zSDVBM0JyTE49OFA4MVVWPT13QzZZQUt3SHdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMzMyNzkzMTY1LjUyNzU5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjI1MDUubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8Mzk2MzBFQUYtOTVBRi00NjlELThDOUEtMzIwNzk5REEyQjMzQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66483,"nextInTopic":66508,"prevInTime":66483,"nextInTime":66485,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think it can be a gross generalization to say that schools are breeding grounds for discrimination .

 They get put into a group of strangers and are left to make their own ideas and fend for themselves socially.  That simply isn&#39;t how my own kids have navigated the social world.  They&#39;ve met people through little connections, through mutual friends and family and made decisions based on how they feel about individuals, not nearly as much based on looks, but on who they are as people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think parents who unschool NEED to talk about race issues.  I think it will come up naturally in the course of their life and can be discussed or merely glanced at.  Kids who live in families where the parents are conscientious and kind, will naturally gravitate to that manner of relating to others and it won&#39;t matter what color of skin someone has. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve met a lot of unschooled kids and I&#39;ve not met a single one that was segregationist and/or narrow minded about the color of a person&#39;s skin.  I&#39;ve met LOTS of schooled kids that have been mistreated because of the way they look, and LOTS of schooled kids that mistreat others for the same reasons.  Schools are breeding grounds for discrimination and that&#39;s why they take such loud proactive steps to try to make kids not be segregationists or narrow minded.  It just doesn&#39;t work.  It&#39;s why studies and articles are written to tell parents to talk about these things, because even schools know that parents have a bigger influence than they do.  So if parents have kids in school, then they should talk about these things, for no other reason than to counter the experiences they have every day while fending for themselves in hostile social environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332788244","msgId":66445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyQzREM0E3LTcyREQtNEQxQS05RkYzLTAyNkI3NjIwQkVCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprcTg0dSthbTVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGprcTg0dSthbTVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66444,"nextInTopic":66447,"prevInTime":66444,"nextInTime":66446,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I do agree that issues of race are important to discuss with our children. -=- I think it can come up naturally in better ways than parents can look in a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2101251918\">-=-I do agree that issues of race are important to discuss with our children. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can come up naturally in better ways than parents can look in a book, see that a study says that school kids don&#39;t learn about race the way their parents wish the did, and then they (the unschooling parents) &quot;discuss race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a part of life.

One is that my four year old daughter, Nisa, loves blonde hair and white skin.  I am Black and my husband is Jewish (White, but he likes to say Jewish).  Nisa has fairly light skin and dark hair.  She loves the Barbie movies and we have watched nearly every one together.  I love many of them too, which is surprising because I didn&#39;t like Barbie much as a kid.  Since getting into Barbie, Nisa has started saying that she wishes she had white skin and blonde hair almost every day.  Today we were playing with shaving cream and water beads, and she rubbed the shaving cream on her arms and told me she now had white skin and was very happy about it.  I lightly said &quot;I liked your skin before.&quot;  When she asked why, I said because she had skin that was a mix between mine and her dad&#39;s.  I asked her what she thought of my skin and she said &quot;Well I think it&#39;s kind of ugly.&quot;  That hurt my feelings.  I didn&#39;t say that to her, because I thought I might have been too emotionally charged and discounting her preferences in initiating that conversation to begin with, although I tried to stay as neutral as possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having a daughter who wishes to be whiter has been triggering me in lots of ways.  We haven&#39;t talked to her about race or history, although we do live in the South.  As a kid, my parents talked to me LOTS about race and history, slavery, Jim Crow, and their own experiences etc.; and I don&#39;t want to do that with her in the same way because it made me feel very angry at a young age.  My sister and I also went to a private school from 3rd-10th grade where we were the first Black students to attend (it was a school that was established in response to forced integration in 1969).  It was very uncomfortable, and we were brought into the principal&#39;s office to talk about our race and how some students might treat us unkindly when we started school there.  I was always on the lookout and on the defensive after that.  So I am not sure that is a great approach.  There were some incidents but in retrospect I wonder if they would have been easier to handle if I had been helped in gentler ways.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my family growing up, if I had expressed the preferences Nisa has, my parents would have ridiculed me.  My parents also often told us not to trust our White friends at school because they would eventually betray us.  I think it might have been kinder to wait until there was an actual issue and then discuss it in that context than to set us up to be looking for those kinds of things.  I could never really relax at that school and was glad when I left.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I might be tacking too much significance to her preferences, but I feel like she has learned from watching Barbie that having brown skin isn&#39;t as beautiful or as preferable as white skin.  That she has somehow absorbed these messages from our culture, as depicted by Barbie.  Then again, maybe it is as simple as she is identifying with a character she likes.  I don&#39;t know.  She had been asking me for a blonde wig for months and I did buy her one to play dress up in at home.  I was happy to give it to her and to see her joy at having it.  It really is no different than having a princess dress and pretending to be a princess, but my baggage keeps me from feeling that way sometimes.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the one hand, I would like my daughter to get to just be a kid.  I don&#39;t want to burden her with too much information or political and social justice issues.  I just don&#39;t really know what is an appropriate way to deal with discussing race and identity with her, or if it is appropriate right now.  Or how to discuss that beauty isn&#39;t only white skin and blonde hair, when that is her current model of beauty.  Or how to deal with my own issues and not pass them along to her.  I do think Barbie in the movies is beautiful and has many admirable qualities; but I wish my daughter thought of herself as beautiful just as she is!  She really is a beautiful girl.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other issue is how to deal with situations where my children are doing things that are socially unacceptable.  This has come up several times on this list recently, and has been on my mind for a while as well.  My biggest problem is that Nisa likes to eat dirt and sand.  She will gleefully do it more if I tell her not to.  She often shoves handfuls into her mouth before we go somewhere (while we are outside in the driveway about to get in the car), and sometimes when she is at the park or something like that.  I tell her to stop firmly and take her hand from her mouth and clean her up.  It is mortifying.  I believe if people see her eating dirt, it will cause problems for our family.  I don&#39;t understand why she does this; when I ask her she says because it tastes good.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband thinks Nisa&#39;s public dirt eating is no big deal.  Just a couple of weeks ago, he took her to a neighbor&#39;s house to see some horses, and I wasn&#39;t there.  He told me she was eating dirt from the driveway in front of the neighbor, whom we had just met that day; and that the neighbor said she should go back to our house and eat our dirt, expressing his discomfort.  Maybe he was not that uncomfortable, I don&#39;t know because I wasn&#39;t there, but I imagine he was.  My husband said he just laughed and did not stop her.  She also picks her nose in public and I have told her that is impolite and I have also said &quot;other people don&#39;t like to see that&quot; and other short, informative phrases like that.  I have also sometimes talked too much.  She still does it; when I see her do it, I take her hand from her nose and often she will just go right back to doing it.  I will offer her a tissue or a trip to the bathroom but she doesn&#39;t take me up on those often.  Sometimes, with the dirt eating, I wonder if there is a deeper reason she is doing this--sometimes she will look right at me when she is doing it, like she wants to get my reaction, which is usually pretty horrified, especially if we are in public.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband, I should mention, frequently does not pick up on social cues.  His father is the same way.  So there could be a genetic predisposition, or it could be normal four year old behavior, or she could be feeling defiant in which case I need to figure out why . . . .  Those are my main theories at the moment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suppose I should be calmer in my response, but continue to stop her from doing these things.  Maybe I will have to keep stopping her over and over.  But it seems to me that I am doing something wrong here.  If I was doing this right, my daughter would be trusting me and not continuing to do something that is inappropriate.  So far that is not happening.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lydia Koltai<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113923555,"authorName":"Herb","from":"Herb &lt;Cfebsleb@...&gt;","profile":"cfebsleb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332632768","msgId":66417,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRUQ4MkY2QjgzN0M5Qy1EMzAtRTFFMEB3ZWJtYWlsLWQwNjIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66413,"nextInTopic":66418,"prevInTime":66416,"nextInTime":66418,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-recently was reading medical research about skin pigmentation and learned that black and Asian skin are structurally different than Caucasian skin -- these ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1914108110\">-=-recently was reading medical research about skin pigmentation and learned that<br/>\nblack and Asian skin are structurally different than Caucasian skin -- these<br/>\ndifferences may account for why non-Caucasian skin appear more youthful than<br/>\nCaucasian skin over time.

The winners of the most &quot;heartier/healthier&quot; skin would be someone native to Bougainville Island. It&#39;s my understanding that they are the darkest skinned people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading this and it bothered me. I&#39;ve known about the benefits of melanin for a long time. Increased melanin is great under certain situation and not under others. People with different skin colors have them because there are benefit to having the color of skin they have when living in certain places on the earth. My very light colored skin works very well in an area like the British Isles. It would look younger and healthier there than in sunny, dry southern California.  Less melanin enables my body to produce more vitamin D in a low light environment. Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption and bone formation.  Foods in the US have vitamin D added to help compensate for reduced sun exposure and vitamin D in peoples bodies.  I had a friend in Arkansas that had a dark skinned child that wasn&#39;t getting addition vitamin D in her food and had what I think was called subclinical rickets.  I don&#39;t know if the child could have been in the sun more and increased her vitamin D enough to compensate without taking a supplement. There is on going research to look at vitamin D levels and it&#39;s affect on the immune system, decrease breast cancer rates, a possible link to multiple sclerosis. Some researchers think it is possible that the vitamin D requirements are set to low. That they are good enough for calcium absorption, but too low for optimal immune system function. Light colored skin provides a health benefit in low light areas if vitamin D supplementation is not provided. The point I&#39;m trying to make is that not any skin color is more superior than another. They were select for in certain environments. My skin was not selected to work well near the equator, unless... maybe I was under a heavy jungle canopy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n When talking about skin color with my children I tell them there are advantages and disadvantages to all skin types and why that is. I don&#39;t want my kids to think their skin color is better or worse than another skin color. I don&#39;t want them to think that one look is more or less beautiful than another. I feel it is just as harmful to a child to make them think they are better in someway because of skin color as to make them think they are less. I really do believe all people of different colors of skin are beautiful and love all the differences.  The different skin colors provide advantages and disadvantages. My Mom had a book I use to look at all the time when I was a kid. It had pictures of faces of people from everywhere in the World. The native Australians, Papua New Guinean, Inuit,many different Native American groups, Scandinavians, different groups from Pacific islands, Asia, Africa, Europe....lots and lots of people from many different areas with different skin colors and looks.   I loved that book and wanted to go see all the people that were in the book. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cfebsleb@...\">cfebsleb@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332618233","msgId":66413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU0OEEwODI0LUYwQkItNEM0QS1CODIyLUM3QkVBMDAyRDA0OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRUQ4MEI4QThCRUY2MS1EMzAtRDdFMkB3ZWJtYWlsLWQwNjIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhDRUQ4MEI4QThCRUY2MS1EMzAtRDdFMkB3ZWJtYWlsLWQwNjIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66411,"nextInTopic":66417,"prevInTime":66412,"nextInTime":66414,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Holly has baby dolls, and played with them even as a teen.

When she was your daughters age, her favorite Barbie was a black skinned Barbie. She carried it every where. I don&#39;t remember if she said she wanted to be black skinned like the Barbie. For me it was never an issue at all. I wasn&#39;t concerned that she might want to be a skin color she wasn&#39;t. I never even thought anything about the Barbie she carried around and I probably wouldn&#39;t have remember it if a woman hadn&#39;t commented on it. One day while buying a balloon for my daughter&#39;s birthday, a black woman made a comment about the Barbie. She was surprised to see a blond hair blue eyed girl carrying a black Barbie around as her favorite. My daughter has Barbies that are all different skin colors and nationalities. I think her least favorite ones have always been the ones that look like her. She doesn&#39;t have a negative image of herself. I think it&#39;s the novelty of different. Your daughter liking white skin might be the novelty of the different to. <br/>\nThere are Sudanese immigrants in my area. I love the color of their skin.

It discusses the possible benefit to young children eating dirt. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet Them Eat Dirt  |  The Scientist <br/>\nthe-scientist.com<br/>\nLet Them Eat Dirt |<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n For my children, especially my son, age made the biggest difference in them stopping embarrassing behavior. The things you speak of your daughter doing are things I see many kids do. When my son was your daughters age, my many attempts to stop certain behaviors seemed to increase them. It made him aware that they got a reaction. I had to switch to distraction so that he was less aware that something bothered me. For example if your daughter went to pick her nose, you could just gently remover her hand and put a kleenex in it, without saying don&#39;t do that. If she bends down to eat dirt when getting out of the car, you could bend over to take her hand calmly, brush it off and say let hold hands and continue on to where you were going. I don&#39;t know if those idea will help, but for my son it would work much better than telling him &quot;no&quot; or giving a long explanation of why it wasn&#39;t OK. If nothing else you live through the things kids do when they are young and they grow up and stop. My kids are both over 11 year old now and all the embarrassing things they did when they were younger don&#39;t matter or are remembered fondly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cfebsleb@...\">cfebsleb@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332605358","msgId":66409,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpra3JqZStucmk1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3QjlFMDZELUI2RjQtNEI4Mi04RDVDLTY2NjlCQ0IzRDhDQ0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66408,"nextInTopic":66411,"prevInTime":66408,"nextInTime":66410,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* It occurred to me to wonder if you re confusing correlation and causality.

She tries to dress up as She-Ra with what she has and we&#39;ve been getting materials together to make her a complete costume.  I&#39;m of Korean descent and her dad is Irish-Mexican-Polish.  She has dark hair, eyes and olive-y skin and looks hapa.  She had asked for a blonde wig to go with her Disney princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) dress about a year ago and I got it for her.  She wore it a handful of times and then lost interest. She asked me a year or two ago if she would grow up and be &quot;all-Korean&quot; like me and was visibly sad when I first explained that she would be always be &quot;half-Korean&quot;.  (I did tell her she would always be made of all-love, though, and that made her smile.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRace was discussed when I was growing up because my parents immigrated at a time (mid-60s) and to a place (small-town Texas) where there weren&#39;t many Asians.  My parents both faced a lot of discrimination and I heard these stories from them while being teased for &quot;chinky&quot; eyes and my house smelling rotten (from kimchi).  As a teenager, I asked for aqua blue contacts instead of plain ones when I needed them to correct my vision.  My mother bought them for me without adding any commentary or judgment and I enjoyed wearing them.  My father had offered me a trip to Korea to get my eyes &quot;done&quot; as an adolescent -- to get the eyelid crease that most non-Asians have.  I did not want that because I had no desire to have surgery nor did I feel i needed &quot;bigger&quot; eyes.  I did enjoy the colored contacts for their shock value and novelty.  I did not wear them everyday.  When I got older (20s), before it was trendy for Asian girls to lighten their hair, I was a tawny blonde for a while and I absolutely got more attention, more smiles and better service when out and about.  It was fun to be blonde!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a vested interest in understanding cultural identity issues as an adolescent and young adult partly because my parents never spoke about Korea unless specifically asked.  I satisfied my own search for identity in college by getting a grant to go to Korea to record my grandfather&#39;s oral history when I was an undergraduate.  It was an eye-opening experience for me to be one of many people of the same race and ethnicity in a country as opposed to a minority.  It was also eye-opening to recognize that while I looked like other Koreans, just how different I was from them sine I was born and raised in America.  Also interesting was to see how my parents were different than Koreans in Korea at the present time -- like they had kept the Korean cultural values from the 60s alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as hard as it is to sort out race from identity or looks and story -- when I think about my experience, I appreciate that my parents shared some things with me (mistreatment in the US) and not the things that were too difficult for them to discuss (Japanese occupation, Korean war) simply because one was relevant to my immediate experience (prejudice and teasing) and the other was a historical tragedy that they were still scarred from and wouldn&#39;t necessarily help me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my daughters, I try to stay focused on what they are asking for and asking questions (if it&#39;s needed) so I can understand them and share with them in a relevant way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is particularly interested in his Mexican roots because his Mexican grandfather pretended to be Italian and refused to speak Spanish when he immigrated to Philadelphia.  Though my father-in-law never learned Spanish, my husband took an interest in learning Spanish and is fluent.  We talk about race, immigration, acculturation and prejudice in our house as it comes up in response to things that are happening with our girls or as relevant holidays/anniversaries pass.  We talk about it as we would bring up an interesting story or fact we happen to know about something they are interested in.  We check out books from the library about different cultures and make an effort to go to events that enrich our understanding of different self-identifying groups of people.  I grew up being particularly sensitive to the fact that most media and reading I was exposed to or assigned to read was from a predominately white, male creator and/or about a white, make protagonist.  I love that Unschooling allows me to give my girls exposure to as broad a range of voices and cultures as interest allows.  Carolina has been interested in ancient Egypt and native American cultures most recently but her interest in their mythology has led us now to a book about mythology across cultures...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I lightly said &quot;I liked your skin before.&quot; When she asked why, I said because she had skin that was a mix between mine and her dad&#39;s.

There is research that suggests the difference in black skin in addition to the protective effect of pigment may account for the resistance to cancer!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can enjoy knowing and sharing with your daughter that black skin is actually heartier/healthier, and beautiful :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":413967925,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;beatrice.mantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332549840","msgId":66403,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprajVjZyt0amo1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5RURBMUFCLUE2NUEtNDJERi1BM0MzLUU5RkZFMkFDMTkxNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":66401,"nextInTopic":66407,"prevInTime":66402,"nextInTime":66404,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think (and I could be wrong) that IF a mother does that, she can create antibodies in her that will go into the baby through the milk (if the baby was in need of anti-bodies)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wouldn&#39;t totally discount those kinds of things, nor would I build a religion out of them.   &quot;Some validity,&quot; perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332517722","msgId":66368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4MDEyQTg3LTZFNkYtNDY3My04RTlBLTZFREY3MkI1N0Q0NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpraDFhdCttazluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpraDFhdCttazluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66367,"nextInTopic":66369,"prevInTime":66367,"nextInTime":66369,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Boogers and dirt...

I loved to look in there and wish I had blonde hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was blond and vain about it, and has light blue eyes.  The worst part of marrying me, I&#39;m sure, was that our kids have brown eyes and darker hair--one as dark as mine, two lighter, but not blond.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a consideration for a long, long time, whether people look like an ideal (which changes) or like their relatives.  We can&#39;t change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn India there are commercials all over the place for lotions that lighten skin.  They have a range of brown, from dark brown to light brown, and the lighter is preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the U.S. these days, people pay money to get browner (by tanning booth, skin lotions or sprays) because really-white isn&#39;t considered healthy looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the U.S. when my grandmother was young, though, she wore gloves and bonnets when she worked outside so she wouldn&#39;t get at all tan.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night on 30 Rock, Henry Winckler (who used to play Fonzie) was playing a Jewish-hippie-dad character who was an author of kids&#39; books and someone said his books were so cool and &quot;urban&quot; that they thought he must&#39;ve been black, and he said &quot;Thank you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are kids in New Mexico who are anglo but who act and dress in ways that will lead people to believe they are Hispanic (or half Hispanic kids, like a dozen of my cousins and nephews, who don&#39;t identify with the anglo part of them At ALL).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not such a black-and-white issue.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think accept it as a preference that might change or might not.  <br/>\nI think your instinct to wait until she starts to figure things out her own way, or actually has a problem, or asks questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery often parents find themselves in a situation where they might not see a way to make things better, but they could easily make things worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":511640869,"authorName":"whisperingwindsacademy","from":"&quot;whisperingwindsacademy&quot; &lt;bradnstaceypropst@...&gt;","profile":"whisperingwindsacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Two big questions: Race and identity, and socially unacceptable behavior","postDate":"1332515950","msgId":66369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpraTQ5ZStiYzQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpraDFhdCttazluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66368,"nextInTopic":66373,"prevInTime":66368,"nextInTime":66370,"topicId":66350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Lydia, First off, I have no experience/help about eating dirt.

(I do know a quick google search provides much info on it, and most did not seem too alarming)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the nose picking... I have a four year old son, we deal with this on a daily basis. ;-)  When I see he is doing that, I offer him a tissue, he normally declines, I then just tell him most people do not like to see that, and sometimes there are things in our nose we can not get out with just blowing and if he feels the need to use his finger, just please go into the bathroom.<br/>\nThis has been helping... he will be watching tv, get up go to the bathroom and come back real quick.  I asked him if he is ok, and he says yes he just needed to get something out of his nose.<br/>\n(not sure if that helps)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe race issue, I have experience here... but opposite of yours.  I am white, with a very blended family.  I have a daughter who is 19 and her father is black.  I have another daughter who is 14 and her father is white.  I pretty much raised them by myself (until about 5 years ago when I married a wonderful man, who loves them both equally with all his heart!  I have always tried to teach them not to see color, we are all just human.  I know realistically that does not always work.  My oldest daughter, Cassie has identified more with black people.  She choose to go to a college rich in black history in NC. Most all her friends are black or mixed.  Her boyfriends are always black or mixed.  My 14 year old, Alyssa has a wide variety of friends, white, black, asian etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with my wonderful husband came two new wonderful little boys.  Nicholas is 4 and Ian is 3.<br/>\n(my husband is white, well he has some native american indian in his recent back ground, so he is a little darker skinned then I am, and tans really easy and fast)<br/>\nNicholas looks just like his dad, and has his skin tone, and straight black hair.<br/>\nIan looks like my family light colored hair and curls, and dose not show a preference or seem to be aware of the differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicholas is very aware of the differences and has been since a very young age, and constantly prefers the black or mixed people in our life.  He wishes he skin was darker like Cassie&#39;s.  Her boyfriend is Nicholas&#39;s best friend in the world. (according to Nicholas)  One of Alyssa&#39;s close friends (Deja who is black) Nicholas is always talking about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I do not have the racial emotional baggage you do.  So my thoughts are probably not as hurtful as yours can be.  (and I mean you being hurt by her wanting to be more white)<br/>\n<br/>\nI acknowledge Nicholas when he says these things, and respect his preferences and really just leave it at that.  His tastes may change as he gets older and they may not.  I tell him he is totally awesome the way he is, and say nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if this is helping you or not, I remember when Cassie was young and first started to gravitate towards more &quot;black things&quot;.  My family had issues with it, but I tried to explain there is no way for us to identify with her or know what she is feeling.  She is absolutely beautiful no matter what, and I told my family I had to be supportive and respectful of her choices when it came to race issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is love her, respect her preferences, support her in her choices, they may change with age, they may not.  Do not take her preferences personal, they are her own.  I do not think there is anything anyone can do or say to change them and why would you? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;LydiaK&quot; &lt;princessjasmine05@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have two issues I have been trying to deal with for a little while now unsuccessfully.
