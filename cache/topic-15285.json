It actually<br/>\nsounds an octave lower than one would expect. It is similar in length to<br/>\na flute or soprano sax but sounds an octave lower. Can you explain why<br/>\nthe clarinet sounds as a stopped-pipe as opposed to the flute or sax<br/>\nwhich sound as open pipes?<br/>\n <br/>\n-- Glynn Furr from Cary, NC<br/>\n <br/>\nAs anyone who&#39;s ever heard Prokoviev&#39;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; knows, the<br/>\nclarinet is actually a fossilized cat. Flutes are fossilized birds.<br/>\nSome birds are as big as cats, but they&#39;re still birds and therefore<br/>\nmake a comparatively high pitched or, scientifically speaking, &quot;Tweaty&quot;<br/>\nnoise compared to a clarinet, or cat. The term &quot;stopped pipe&quot; refers to<br/>\na bird caught in the cat&#39;s throat. Probably the cat was nabbed by<br/>\ninstrument makers before he could finish chewing his meal. They make<br/>\nmost musical instruments in other countries, where there are no animal<br/>\nprotection laws.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14749,"nextTopicId":15308}}
