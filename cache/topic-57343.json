It&#39;s been repaired  <br/>\ntwice.  He said it was not as reliable as it used to be, and later  <br/>\nthis month his job is moving across town to a new facility.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor months he has looked at cars and considered what he wanted to get,  <br/>\ncarefully comparing prices, and the relative merits of a sedan or a  <br/>\npickup truck.  Regular cab or crew cab.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he called me.  The papers were in progress, but he was  <br/>\ndriving home to get his checkbook, because he didn&#39;t know they  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t take a down payment from a debit or credit card.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nas prepared as I thought I was,&quot; he said, but he was kind of glad of  <br/>\nthe chance to talk to me and his dad before he signed the final  <br/>\npapers.  I reminded him about getting it insured, and to take the  <br/>\ninsurance card from his old car so they would know he had insurance,  <br/>\nand so he would have the phone number to call and add this car before  <br/>\nhe drove it away.   Keith talked to him about refinancing the loan  <br/>\nthrough USAA rather than CarMax, and not to sign away his right to pay  <br/>\nit off early without penalty.  I suggested he borrow money from us,  <br/>\npay it in full, and just owe us money instead.  But he said no, he  <br/>\nwanted to establish credit and this was a good way to do it.  He put  <br/>\n$5,000 down, so the payments would be lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although he was happy to have us advise him, he was also happy not  <br/>\nto take financial assistance, and he drove the car away in time to go  <br/>\nto dinner.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a 2008 Mazda 8 sedan, black, four-door, standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I was looking through photos for something to use for  <br/>\n&quot;Just Add Light and Stir.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if I mentioned that new  <br/>\nproject here.  It&#39;s a daily inspirational post (or e-mail).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn a few days, the image will be this photo of Keith and a baby-Kirby,  <br/>\nprobably five months old, if this was (as I think) Christmas at  <br/>\nKeith&#39;s parents&#39; house.  I really like mirror photos, but I like that  <br/>\nKirby is looking at Kirby, and Keith is looking at Kirby.  And it  <br/>\nseemed a good companion photo to the car-purchase of yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/website%20various%20bits/mirrors/mirrorkirbybaby.jpg\">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/website%20various%20bits/mirrors/mirrorkirbybaby.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57326,"nextTopicId":57358}}
