Your family is<br/>\ntransformed by the addition of each child and that alone can cause big<br/>\nchanges.  Everything is different with a new baby in your life.  One of the<br/>\nthings that helped smooth over some of the rough edges was getting a<br/>\nmother&#39;s helper.  (A local girl, Lydia, age 10 I think, who was eager to<br/>\nget some baby sitting experience but not ready to watch children solo.)<br/>\n She came two afternoons a week.  My original plan was to have her fresh<br/>\nand available to play games with my then two year old Gabriella but as it<br/>\nturned out what Gabriella really was missing was time with me. So in the<br/>\nend Lydia would hold and play with Baby Harry and I would have two hours to<br/>\nbe with Gabriella, while still being available to Harry if he needed to<br/>\nnurse or what have you.  Having a helper come in can be a breath of fresh<br/>\nair and new energy even on days when you cannot get out of the house<br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia (Gabriella 8 & Harry 6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jun 20, 2012 at 3:28 PM, Susanne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suboeki@...\">suboeki@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a single mother of a 5yo and a 1yo.

Not many people can do that even if they want to.  It requires resources most people don&#39;t have.  A couple is more likely to be able to do it than a single person.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOwning a yacht isn&#39;t a right or a privilege bestowed by any government or philosophy.  It&#39;s a luxury.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children&#39;s happiness is a major goal, divorce is rarely beneficial  I heard recently that there&#39;s an unschooling advocate in Europe who promotes and encourages divorce.  How awful!!  Children don&#39;t need &quot;unschooling&quot; as much as they need a stable, loving homelife.  There are other ways to be and to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s all too late for that in your family, it&#39;s not too late in others who are reading here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can afford (financially) to stay home with your children, and reconciliation is not a possibility, I recommend keeping a blog of happy activities you do with the kids, pictures of things you&#39;ve seen and places you&#39;ve been, pictures of things they&#39;ve made and done.   This might be more useful than other things on the site for a while:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/breathing\">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nExpect behavioral issues and be sympathetic to them.  Too often, mothers assume the divorce  has hurt them but that their children will recover quickly.  (Sometimes mothers tell themselves the divorce won&#39;t hurt anyone.)  And too often children pretend to be okay to soothe their mother&#39;s&#39; fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a> might be helpful, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":324321170,"authorName":"Susanne","from":"&quot;Susanne&quot; &lt;suboeki@...&gt;","profile":"suboeki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"single parent unschooling","postDate":"1340220484","msgId":67749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpydDg4NCs3YXY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67761,"prevInTime":67748,"nextInTime":67750,"topicId":67749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am a single mother of a 5yo and a 1yo.
