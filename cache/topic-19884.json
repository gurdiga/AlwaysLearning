I looked at all the people and grumbled to myself. I <br/>\nwould be in here forever and I just had so much to do. Christmas was <br/>\nbeginning to become such a drag. I kinda wished that I could just <br/>\nsleep through Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I hurried the best I could through all the people to the toy <br/>\ndepartment. Once again I kind of mumbled to myself at the prices of <br/>\nall these toys. And wondered if the grandkids would even play with <br/>\nthem. I found myself in the doll aisle. <br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw a little boy, about 5, holding a <br/>\nlovely doll. He kept touching her hair and he held her so gently. I <br/>\ncould not seem to help myself. I just kept looking over at the little <br/>\nboy and wondered who the doll was for. I watched him turn to a woman, <br/>\nand he called his aunt by name and said, &quot;Are you sure I don&#39;t have <br/>\nenough money?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe replied a bit impatiently, &quot;You know that you don&#39;t have enough <br/>\nmoney for it.&quot; The aunt told the little boy not to go anywhere, that <br/>\nshe had to go get some other things and would be back in a few <br/>\nminutes. And then she left the aisle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy continued to hold the doll. After a bit I asked the boy who <br/>\nthe doll was for. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said, &quot;It is the doll my sister wanted so badly for Christmas. She <br/>\njust knew that Santa would bring it.&quot; I told him that maybe Santa was <br/>\ngoing to bring it. He said, &quot;No, Santa can&#39;t go where my sister <br/>\nis...I have to give the doll to my Mamma to take to her.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him where his sister was.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe looked at me with the saddest eyes and said, &quot;She has gone to be <br/>\nwith Jesus. My Daddy says that Mama is going to have to go be with <br/>\nher.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart nearly stopped beating. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the boy looked at me again and said, &quot;I told my Daddy to tell <br/>\nMama not to go yet. I told him to tell her to wait till I got back <br/>\nfrom the store&quot;. Then he asked me if I wanted to see his picture. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him I would love to. He pulled out some pictures he had taken <br/>\nat the front of the store. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;I want my Mamma to take this with her so she don&#39;t ever <br/>\nforget me. I love my Mama so very much and I wish she did not have to <br/>\nleave me. But Daddy says she will need to be with my sister.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw that the little boy had lowered his head and had grown so very <br/>\nquiet. While he was not looking, I reached into my purse and pulled <br/>\nout a handful of bills. I asked the little boy, &quot;Shall we count that <br/>\nmoney one more time?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHe grew excited and said &quot;Yes, I just know it has to be enough&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I slipped my money in with his, and we began to count it. Of <br/>\ncourse it was plenty for the doll. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe softly said, &quot;Thank you, Jesus, for giving me enough money.&quot; Then <br/>\nthe boy said &quot;I just asked Jesus to give me enough money to buy this <br/>\ndoll, so Mama can take it with her, to give to my sister. And He <br/>\nheard my prayer. I wanted to ask Him for enough to buy my Mama a <br/>\nwhite rose, but I didn&#39;t ask Him, but He gave me enough to buy the <br/>\ndoll and a rose for my Mama. She loves white roses so very, very <br/>\nmuch&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a few minutes the aunt came back, and I wheeled my cart away. I <br/>\ncould not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my <br/>\nshopping in a totally different spirit than when I had started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I kept remembering a story I had seen in the newspaper several <br/>\ndays earlier, about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing a little <br/>\ngirl and leaving the Mother in serious condition.The family was <br/>\ndeciding on whether to remove the life support. Now surely this <br/>\nlittle boy did not belong with that story. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo days later, I read in the paper where the family had disconnected <br/>\nthe life support and the young woman had died. I could not forget the <br/>\nlittle boy, and just kept wondering if the two were somehow <br/>\nconnected. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater that day, I could not help myself and I went out and bought <br/>\nsome white roses and took them to the funeral home, where the young <br/>\nwoman was. And there she was, holding a lovely white rose, the <br/>\nbeautiful doll, and the picture of the little boy in the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI left there in tears, my life changed forever. The love that little <br/>\nboy had for his little sister and his mother was overwhelming. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in a split second a drunk driver had ripped the life of that <br/>\nlittle boy to pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor Unknown<br/>\n<br/>\nThe earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and <br/>\nwonderful results.
