For about the last month a group has begun forming in <br/>\nour area.  It is slow and very committee minded.  Everyone concerned <br/>\nthat it functions as a democracy, something I must admit to being <br/>\nonly nominally interested in.  Fortunately I am vocal and pushy and <br/>\nam able to be somewhat effective in molding the group to fit my <br/>\nneeds.  All I want is a group that meets regularly and that gives my <br/>\nkids some other kids to play with.  At least that is what I profess <br/>\nto wanting.  I find, however, as time goes by that what I really <br/>\nwant is a group of unschoolers who hang out and trust that children <br/>\nlearn what they need to learn as they need to learn it.  It isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to happen.  Many of the other people involved in this <br/>\nfledgling organization have children who are still in school; are <br/>\nvery concerned with educational opportunities; are incredibly <br/>\ncurriculum minded.  There are a couple of yahoo lists to help <br/>\norganize meetings in the area and the level of discussion about <br/>\ncurriculum is so very discouraging.  There is a trip planned for <br/>\ntoday to some Roman ruins and one mother of a 4 and 2 year old has a <br/>\ncouple of worksheets for them to do most specifically on Roman <br/>\nnumerals.  I don&#39;t understand it.  I don&#39;t know Roman Numerals.  I <br/>\ncan get to about 39.  And the only time I am really curious or in <br/>\nneed is doing crossword puzzles or trying to figure out the <br/>\ncopyright on some old movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we wrote out words using Braille coding.  Simon wanted <br/>\nto know what Braille was so I looked on line for an alphabet and <br/>\nthen we did a few words in Braille.  He can&#39;t read or write with the <br/>\nEnglish alphabet, but it didn&#39;t stop him from writing mom and Simon <br/>\nand Linnaea in Braille.  And then he got bored.  I wrote a brief <br/>\nparagraph because it fascinated me, but by the time I was done he <br/>\nwas typing out math problems on the typewriter.  As I write this it <br/>\nsounds like such an academic pursuit.  But most days we sit and <br/>\nwatch a lot of television.  We watch DVDs on the computer, we play <br/>\nHarry Potter II, we play Reader Rabbit (which I loathe but they <br/>\nlove) we staple paper to paper to make picture frames (okay, so that <br/>\njust happened yesterday and today and Simon taught me how to do it) <br/>\nwe play a game on occasion, we read books, we build card houses, we <br/>\nwalk the dog.  But the Braille was his curiosity.  And there was no <br/>\ntesting and there were no worksheets and when he was done he was <br/>\ndone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that isn&#39;t the problem.  I don&#39;t mind how Simon learns or how <br/>\nLinnaea learns.  What I mind is how little trust these people have <br/>\nin their children.  I realized recently that I am a real, at my <br/>\ncore, evolutionist.  I believe that what they need to know they will <br/>\nmaster.  If reading is something they have to have to get by in life <br/>\nthey will have reading.  If math makes a difference for them they <br/>\nwill have math.  And I believe that those things are necessary for <br/>\nquality of life.  Since they are likely to live in a world similar <br/>\nto mine, they will acquire those skills as they move through life.  <br/>\nBut whether or not they know Roman numerals or whether or not they <br/>\npassed their GCSE&#39;s or whatever tests they have to take seems moot.  <br/>\nAnd mere dressing.  I think dressing is a wonderful thing, I have of <br/>\nlots of dressing, the best stories are made up primarily of <br/>\ndressing, but what dressing you get and how you get that dressing is <br/>\nsurely an individuals own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not even that I consider myself a very good unschooler. I have <br/>\nmoments of &quot;screw their choices, what about me.&quot; Moments of &quot;if they <br/>\njust did what they were told to do this wouldn&#39;t take so long.&quot; And <br/>\nI have to read and reread posts at unschooling.com and at chat <br/>\ngroups.  I don&#39;t post, I don&#39;t trust enough that I know what I am <br/>\ndoing to know what I am describing. But, I absolutely, without <br/>\nquestion (well without more than the occasional question) believe <br/>\nthat they will learn without being taught.  And so will I.  And in <br/>\nthe U.S. we spent most of our time with schooling homeschoolers or <br/>\nwith schooled children.  It just wasn&#39;t such an issue, and they were <br/>\nfar more relaxed about their children&#39;s education.  And the only <br/>\nconcern was how well they got along.  And unschooling is a more <br/>\ncommon concept in the US.  Once you&#39;ve announced that you don&#39;t <br/>\nschool you have fewer conversations about what curriculum you are <br/>\nusing.  Everyone here is scared about testing.  Testing in the UK is <br/>\nhow you know your child is going to succeed in the world.  If they <br/>\ncan&#39;t pass the tests they can&#39;t get into University.  If they don&#39;t <br/>\nget into University they won&#39;t have any kind of future.

For about the last month a group has begun forming in <br/>\nour area.  It is slow and very committee minded.  Everyone concerned <br/>\nthat it functions as a democracy, something I must admit to being <br/>\nonly nominally interested in.  Fortunately I am vocal and pushy and <br/>\nam able to be somewhat effective in molding the group to fit my <br/>\nneeds.  All I want is a group that meets regularly and that gives my <br/>\nkids some other kids to play with.  At least that is what I profess <br/>\nto wanting.  I find, however, as time goes by that what I really <br/>\nwant is a group of unschoolers who hang out and trust that children <br/>\nlearn what they need to learn as they need to learn it.  It isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to happen.  Many of the other people involved in this <br/>\nfledgling organization have children who are still in school; are <br/>\nvery concerned with educational opportunities; are incredibly <br/>\ncurriculum minded.  There are a couple of yahoo lists to help <br/>\norganize meetings in the area and the level of discussion about <br/>\ncurriculum is so very discouraging.  There is a trip planned for <br/>\ntoday to some Roman ruins and one mother of a 4 and 2 year old has a <br/>\ncouple of worksheets for them to do most specifically on Roman <br/>\nnumerals.  I don&#39;t understand it.  I don&#39;t know Roman Numerals.  I <br/>\ncan get to about 39.  And the only time I am really curious or in <br/>\nneed is doing crossword puzzles or trying to figure out the <br/>\ncopyright on some old movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we wrote out words using Braille coding.  Simon wanted <br/>\nto know what Braille was so I looked on line for an alphabet and <br/>\nthen we did a few words in Braille.  He can&#39;t read or write with the <br/>\nEnglish alphabet, but it didn&#39;t stop him from writing mom and Simon <br/>\nand Linnaea in Braille.  And then he got bored.  I wrote a brief <br/>\nparagraph because it fascinated me, but by the time I was done he <br/>\nwas typing out math problems on the typewriter.  As I write this it <br/>\nsounds like such an academic pursuit.  But most days we sit and <br/>\nwatch a lot of television.  We watch DVDs on the computer, we play <br/>\nHarry Potter II, we play Reader Rabbit (which I loathe but they <br/>\nlove) we staple paper to paper to make picture frames (okay, so that <br/>\njust happened yesterday and today and Simon taught me how to do it) <br/>\nwe play a game on occasion, we read books, we build card houses, we <br/>\nwalk the dog.  But the Braille was his curiosity.  And there was no <br/>\ntesting and there were no worksheets and when he was done he was <br/>\ndone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that isn&#39;t the problem.  I don&#39;t mind how Simon learns or how <br/>\nLinnaea learns.  What I mind is how little trust these people have <br/>\nin their children.  I realized recently that I am a real, at my <br/>\ncore, evolutionist.  I believe that what they need to know they will <br/>\nmaster.  If reading is something they have to have to get by in life <br/>\nthey will have reading.  If math makes a difference for them they <br/>\nwill have math.  And I believe that those things are necessary for <br/>\nquality of life.  Since they are likely to live in a world similar <br/>\nto mine, they will acquire those skills as they move through life.  <br/>\nBut whether or not they know Roman numerals or whether or not they <br/>\npassed their GCSE&#39;s or whatever tests they have to take seems moot.  <br/>\nAnd mere dressing.  I think dressing is a wonderful thing, I have of <br/>\nlots of dressing, the best stories are made up primarily of <br/>\ndressing, but what dressing you get and how you get that dressing is <br/>\nsurely an individuals own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not even that I consider myself a very good unschooler. I have <br/>\nmoments of &quot;screw their choices, what about me.&quot; Moments of &quot;if they <br/>\njust did what they were told to do this wouldn&#39;t take so long.&quot; And <br/>\nI have to read and reread posts at unschooling.com and at chat <br/>\ngroups.  I don&#39;t post, I don&#39;t trust enough that I know what I am <br/>\ndoing to know what I am describing. But, I absolutely, without <br/>\nquestion (well without more than the occasional question) believe <br/>\nthat they will learn without being taught.  And so will I.  And in <br/>\nthe U.S. we spent most of our time with schooling homeschoolers or <br/>\nwith schooled children.  It just wasn&#39;t such an issue, and they were <br/>\nfar more relaxed about their children&#39;s education.  And the only <br/>\nconcern was how well they got along.  And unschooling is a more <br/>\ncommon concept in the US.  Once you&#39;ve announced that you don&#39;t <br/>\nschool you have fewer conversations about what curriculum you are <br/>\nusing.  Everyone here is scared about testing.  Testing in the UK is <br/>\nhow you know your child is going to succeed in the world.  If they <br/>\ncan&#39;t pass the tests they can&#39;t get into University.  If they don&#39;t <br/>\nget into University they won&#39;t have any kind of future.  And once <br/>\nthe world is defined in those boxes it is hard to see around them.  <br/>\nHow do I live in a world full of boxes I don&#39;t believe in?  Sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I am just feeling bogged down in a world with too few like-<br/>\nminded individuals. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12676,"nextTopicId":12619}}
