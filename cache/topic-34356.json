Claire","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-940315260\">I always wanted to be the cool mom when thinking about my <br/>\nrelationship with my kids but I never really thought about <br/>\nrelationships with their friends.  Claire is having some problems <br/>\nwith her boyfriend of 6 months and they both asked me to sit and <br/>\ntalk with them about it.  I felt honored that they would trust me so <br/>\nmuch to let me in like that.  I hope I helped.  I tried to stay <br/>\nobjective and tried to just repeat what they said.  In other words, <br/>\nI was helping them communicate, a skill I didn&#39;t learn until my <br/>\n30s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, I was taking Sebastian (her boyfriend) home.  Claire <br/>\nstayed home because her head was hurting and she wanted to go to <br/>\nbed.  That gave Sebastian and I a chance to talk alone.  He told me <br/>\nit felt both weird and good to be able to talk to me and trust me.  <br/>\nHe said he was going to be sad if he and Claire broke up because <br/>\nhe&#39;d miss our family.  As I was driving home, I thought back on <br/>\ntalks he and I had.  He tells me about his difficulties with his <br/>\nparents, their expectations, his progress in school, his hopes and <br/>\ndreams for when he gets out of school.  It never occurred to me <br/>\nuntil tonight that I might be the only adult in his life who listens <br/>\nto him and doesn&#39;t have a preset of expectations for him.  And then <br/>\nI thought about some of her other friends who have trusted me enough <br/>\nto talk with me.  It just made me really thankful for the awesome, <br/>\ntrusting relationship I have with my kids.  I wish the parents of <br/>\nthese other kids could have that same type of relationship with <br/>\ntheir children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34353,"nextTopicId":34360}}
