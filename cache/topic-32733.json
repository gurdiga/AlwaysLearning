I  <br/>\nknew they loved their statistics, and I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;absent&quot;  <br/>\nfor the rest of my life, but there it was.  I was baptized in that  <br/>\nchurch, they had seen evidence that I was &quot;really saved,&quot; and I had  <br/>\ndone more Bible study and more choir singing (junior and adult at the  <br/>\nsame time for a year or two) than any other single kid at that  <br/>\nchurch, so where would they mark that I&#39;d gone?
