They ve got a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-576319347\">My mom just sent David a book called The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. I really like Henry Harpending&#39;s work. They&#39;ve got a website up for the book: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://the10000yearexplosion.com/\">http://the10000yearexplosion.com/</a> (ooh, I got Rick Rolled off the site, hee, hee)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, the book is based on the idea that not only did humans not stop evolving 10,000 years ago, or 50,000 as some people posit, but that through civilization we&#39;ve accelerated change through evolution. They use dogs as an example of rapid evolution. Dogs have been domesticated for roughly the same time as humans have been farming. The traits that they carry as dogs are derived from the genetic traits that a wolf has, but adapted in ways that are appropriate for their environment. So, a border-collie&#39;s hyper herding instinct is derived from wolf game-herding patterns, but is exaggerated as it was the herding that made the dog best suited to the environment of a shephard&#39;s dog. They also point out that some wolf traits have disappeared either entirely in dogs, like regurgitating food for their puppies, or having male parental care, or traits that have disappeared in most breeds of dogs, like digging birthing dens or having a specific time of year when<br/>\n they go into season. The point of the comparison is to say:  &quot;[a]ny adaptation, whether physical or behavioral, that loses its utility in a new environment can be lost rapidly, especially if it has any noticeable cost. Fish in lightless cave lose their sight over a few thousand years at most--much more rapidly than it took for eyes to evolve in the first place.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that sets the stage for the idea that the Inuit are less adapted to a farmed diet, whereas those of us who have not recently come from a hunter-gatherer or a horticulturalists society are much more adapted to these diets. They write: &quot;There is every reason to think that early farmers developed serious health problems from this low-protein, vitamin-short, high-carbohydrate diet. Infant mortality increased, and the poor diet was likely one of the causes. You can see the mismatch between the genes and the environment in the skeletal evidence. Humans who adopted agriculture shrank: Average height dropped by almost five inches.&quot; They continue with &quot;There are numerous signs of pathology in the bones of early agriculturalists. In the Americas, the introduction of maize led to widespread tooth decay and anemia due to iron deficiency, since maize is low in bioavailable iron. This story is not new: Many researchers have written about the health problems<br/>\n stemming from the advent of agriculture. Our point is that, over millennia, populations responded to these new pressures. People who had genetic variants that helped them deal with the new diet had more surviving children, and those variants spread: Farmers began to adapt to an agricultural diet. Humanity changed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey argue that the increased incidence of diabetes among populations who have never farmed or that haven&#39;t farmed for long is a consequence of a lesser degree of adaptation to high-carbohydrate diets. It would take time to undo the changes that our changed environment has wrought, maybe the thousands of years that it takes for fish to go blind. And while we probably still have some of the genetic predispositions of our pre-agriculture forebears, more or less depending on who they were and how they subsisted, most of us are fairly well adapted to the diet of agriculture. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Laura Beaudin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura.beaudin@...\">laura.beaudin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 4 February, 2009 4:31:51 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Food Questions<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...okay..<br/>\n<br/>\nProof that we can live without sugar?

I look at her and see her father&#39;s <br/>\ngenetics. The things that we share, like hair color and skin texture, seem <br/>\nto be things that I share with her father as well. Plus she has an allergy <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t, and nor does he, so that came from somewhere unknown. Her <br/>\nbody&#39;s nutritional needs are probably always going to be different from <br/>\nmine. I am not going to tell her what is nourishing to her, because I know <br/>\nthat she can trust her own body to give her good cues. I am not going to <br/>\ntell her that some food is bad for her, because I can trust her to <br/>\nexperience and express how foods make her feel. The only observation that I <br/>\nhave for her is that she gets emotionally volatile and cranky when she is <br/>\nvery hungry, with little self control. And when she is hungry, what matters <br/>\nis calories fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a kind of dance around discovering what she wants to eat. She <br/>\nusually resents it if I make her food without offering her choices first. <br/>\nShe sometimes doesn&#39;t know what she wants until she is able to envisage it. <br/>\n(This is why we love buffets.) I list what we have and I can make and she <br/>\neventually makes a choice. If she can&#39;t then I make something that I will <br/>\neat if she doesn&#39;t care for it. It does take patience and energy from me, <br/>\nmuch more than if I were defining nutritious, limiting to those  and acting <br/>\naccordingly. When we go out I put a huge variety in the food bag.  I make <br/>\nmonkey platter type snack trays too, especially when we have visitors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I was in the bedroom while she was playing with her friends. I <br/>\ncame out to find that she had cooked scrambled eggs for all of them. Her <br/>\nfairly regular visitors are two girls who eat anything that is put in front <br/>\nof them, regardless of how soon they just ate, and will generally finish <br/>\neverything. Once one asked me if she had to finish everything on her plate <br/>\nat dinner time because she was finally full and didn&#39;t like it all that much <br/>\n(of course I said &quot;no&quot; very emphatically), but her sister continued to <br/>\nslowly soldier on until her plate was empty. They express being hungry all <br/>\nthe time. It is no small matter to have them over for a visit!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

We buy from a co-op.  An Amish <br/>\n&gt; farmer (we love to visit his farm!) in PA delivers in our area.  He also <br/>\n&gt; has grass-fed beef and milk-fed pork, among other things.  I know people <br/>\n&gt; who follow the Weston A. Price Foundation&#39;s cookbook Nourishing <br/>\n&gt; Traditions, some more strictly than others.  One who is very strict is not <br/>\n&gt; an unschooling mom but follows Waldorf, which we used to.  It IS <br/>\n&gt; overwhelming!  A great thing for me has been to go to cooking classes that <br/>\n&gt; a leader in our co-op has offered (many of the people in our co-op also <br/>\n&gt; follow Nourishing Traditions and are members of the Weston A.Price <br/>\n&gt; Foundation).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are not strict in our household.  I feel food is a social aspect of <br/>\n&gt; life, whether it&#39;s crap or not. :)  If you&#39;re at a party and everyone&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; eating pizza, it wouldn&#39;t be NT (Nourishing Traditions) to eat it because <br/>\n&gt; the flour wouldn&#39;t have been fresh-ground and soaked in whey and water for <br/>\n&gt; 24 hours to make the dough and the cheese would not have been raw to start <br/>\n&gt; with, blah, blah, blah.  But, to eat it would be a social thing--you&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; like to join in the party and enjoy a slice of pizza!!  So, we dabble in <br/>\n&gt; fast food, drink raw milk, eat fresh fruits and vegetables (my girls are <br/>\n&gt; NUTS for carrots!), and sometimes drink soda.  They&#39;re hardly ever sick. <br/>\n&gt; I know drinking raw milk and eating good quality yogurt adds to the health <br/>\n&gt; of the gut, which is where disease and ill health starts.  This protects <br/>\n&gt; against the ill-effects of the crap they eat and I feel we can still <br/>\n&gt; partake in our social life and in society and enjoy some &#39;bad&quot; food! <br/>\n&gt; They buy soda or candy with their own money and I don&#39;t bat an eye.  It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; their choice!!  And if they are restricted from it while their friends <br/>\n&gt; enjoy, well, life just sucks for them.  So, unless it&#39;s a food allergy, I <br/>\n&gt; say balance is key.  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My .02,<br/>\n&gt; ~Melissa :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;  From: DaBreeze21<br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Sunday, February 01, 2009 11:47 PM<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Food Questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Ok, so I am the posting machine tonight!

These foods haven&#39;t been in our supply <br/>\nfor all that long (in terms of human history), but have become readily available because of <br/>\nthe industrial revolution and factory processing making them cheap to produce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; traditionally consisted of grains, meats, and fruits and veggies, or the<br/>\n&gt; 4 food groups, or the newer pyramid.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this way of looking at food comes from the 1970&#39;s government recommendations--<br/>\nnot necessarily from our European roots.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What these kinds of diets tend to ignore is the fact that indigenous<br/>\n&gt; cultures have always eaten what is most locally abundant, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mean that those things are the exact best thing for each individual to<br/>\n&gt; eat.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t ignore this fact--they are looking at the groups of people that are robustly <br/>\nhealthy and drawing from that.

They either don&#39;t get reported, get mis-reported or are talked <br/>\nabout in terms of being anomalies.   For instance, the government has been trying to <br/>\nprove for 40 years that a low-fat diet is healthy, and they can&#39;t actually make well- <br/>\ndesigned studies show it.   A good book that is pretty exhaustive with detail on the studies <br/>\nis Good Calories, Bad Calories.

I don&#39;t think anyone is talking about viral or bacterially based diseases, although <br/>\nmy own immune system has become remarkably stronger.

Are illnesses really from eating or<br/>\nnot eating food?  There have been different illnesses throughout the<br/>\nhistory of the world.  Thousands of people died from the plague, and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure that those people were eating entirely unprocessed, organically<br/>\ngrown foods.  People used to die from leprosy.  A lot of children never<br/>\nmade it to adult hood.  I think people, in general, are a lot healthier<br/>\nthan a thousand years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe preservation of food in some form or another has been around since<br/>\nhumans have, correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that.  Cheese is a form of<br/>\npreservation of milk, just like dried fruit is a preservation of fresh<br/>\nfruit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d rather eat a fresh apple from cold storage than an apple that was<br/>\nsun dried many months ago and reconstituted in water.  Refridgerators<br/>\nhave allowed us to eat more and more things fresh.  One could argue that<br/>\ncheese powder for mac and cheese is just another way of food<br/>\npreservation.

How narrow should we make our world?  Should we ignore<br/>\nthe global way in which we can accept the world of food?

An Amish farmer (we love to visit his farm!) in PA delivers in our area.  He also has grass-fed beef and milk-fed pork, among other things.  I know people who follow the Weston A. Price Foundation&#39;s cookbook Nourishing Traditions, some more strictly than others.  One who is very strict is not an unschooling mom but follows Waldorf, which we used to.  It IS overwhelming!  A great thing for me has been to go to cooking classes that a leader in our co-op has offered (many of the people in our co-op also follow Nourishing Traditions and are members of the Weston A.Price Foundation). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not strict in our household.  I feel food is a social aspect of life, whether it&#39;s crap or not. :)  If you&#39;re at a party and everyone&#39;s eating pizza, it wouldn&#39;t be NT (Nourishing Traditions) to eat it because the flour wouldn&#39;t have been fresh-ground and soaked in whey and water for 24 hours to make the dough and the cheese would not have been raw to start with, blah, blah, blah.  But, to eat it would be a social thing--you&#39;d like to join in the party and enjoy a slice of pizza!!  So, we dabble in fast food, drink raw milk, eat fresh fruits and vegetables (my girls are NUTS for carrots!), and sometimes drink soda.  They&#39;re hardly ever sick.  I know drinking raw milk and eating good quality yogurt adds to the health of the gut, which is where disease and ill health starts.  This protects against the ill-effects of the crap they eat and I feel we can still partake in our social life and in society and enjoy some &#39;bad&quot; food!   They buy soda or candy with their own money and I don&#39;t bat an eye.  It&#39;s their choice!!  And if they are restricted from it while their friends enjoy, well, life just sucks for them.  So, unless it&#39;s a food allergy, I say balance is key.  And educate your kids on WHY some food is bad for you while others are nourishing!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy .02,<br/>\n~Melissa :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: DaBreeze21 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 01, 2009 11:47 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Food Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, so I am the posting machine tonight!

There have always been books and stories  <br/>\nabout it, one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of religion, superstition and magic (not sleight-of-hand and  <br/>\nillusion) are based on sacrifice.  What will the practitioner offer up  <br/>\nin exchange for power / life / luck?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents decide to sacrifice TV, or books with too many pictures,  <br/>\nhoping they will gain for their children more imagination and a love  <br/>\nof (or dependence upon) books.<br/>\nSome parents decide to sacrifice playing cards and drinking beer and  <br/>\ndancing, so that their children will be in a &quot;Godly&quot; environment and  <br/>\nmore likely to live eternally.<br/>\nSome parents sacrifice sugar, hoping for health and placidness in  <br/>\ntheir children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many cases, adopting a rule or big set of rules is a sacrifice a  <br/>\nparent makes in hopes of not having to think so hard all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that makes unschooling and mindful parenting work,  <br/>\nit seems to me, is the CONSTANT thought and awareness that the world  <br/>\nchanges, people change, what&#39;s great for a three year old might not be  <br/>\ngreat for a twelve-year-old (not just food but anything in any area),  <br/>\nor it might be!!!

I could cut some up and offer them raw and  <br/>\ncook some.  I could ask Holly (the one who likes cooked carrots most)  <br/>\nwhether she&#39;s in the mood for cooked carrots.  She usually is.
