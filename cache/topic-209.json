Watching ripples on a pond or looking at a pine cone is like listening to music.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I do these things, I&#39;m in one of the halls of the world of math. These activities may be the extent of my experience of math, but it IS within the world of math.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor it to be math, I don&#39;t have to feel that I need to push on into the &quot;abstract modeling tools&quot; or using notation unless I darned well feel like it.
