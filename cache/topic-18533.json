I have &#39;found&#39; a few old friends, but they&#39;re living the regular life, with kids busy in soccer, AP classes and bitching about working too much and fighting with their husbands all the time, usually about the kids.  One friend from jr. hi I do see regularly at the neighborhood Target where she works (great use of that essential college education!) and her accounts of having her kids in Christian school are downright surreal.  I keep waiting for her to ask about my kids&#39; school situ, so I can say, &quot;My kids don&#39;t go to school&quot; with no further explanation -- maybe she&#39;ll finally think I&#39;m weird and stop sharing her stories with me....<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

We lived on Morrow, just above Indian School & Chelwood -- actually Manzano district, but my parents insisted we all transfer to Eldorado.

Well, when I went there it was still a Jr. High.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe real joke on my parents was that they wanted us at Eldorado because they were worried about the kind of kids we&#39;d hang out with at Manzano.  My first husband was introduced to me by a friend from Manzano I&#39;d kept up with.  He was a LosAlamos boy, but still it managed to cancel out their desire to have me make a better class of friends!

One girl who was <br/>\ngood at the game and particularly talkative was half Sandia Pueblo and half <br/>\nOklahoma Indian (as she put it on her bio-display, and I assumed to be mixed of <br/>\nthe Oklahoma reservation which WAS mixed when they marched some of the <br/>\nsoutheastern tribes there way back when).  Her oldest item was a basket she said they <br/>\nthought might be 500 years old, and next up some pots that were made by <br/>\ngreat-great-great aunts maybe 200 years ago. I only saw the choir and those five <br/>\nsmall classes, and it&#39;s 6th through 12th so I maybe saw 10 percent of the kids <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of why I know where some of them lived was that the room was covered <br/>\nwith a project where they had used photos and clippings and such to show why <br/>\ntheir families were in Albuquerque.  Some traced back a long way, some just to <br/>\nparents.  Some had photos of where they were before.   The style and tone of <br/>\nthese things (mostly big posters, but not all) were because the teacher, Mo <br/>\nPalmer, used to work at the museum as photoarchivist, so they were doing basically <br/>\nthe kinds of things museums do for history displays.    One kid did one side <br/>\nwith antique post cards of Iowa, and the other with antique New Mexico <br/>\npostcards, because one of his parents was native and the other was from Iowa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started my little presentation with a question about what the oldest thing <br/>\nthey owned was.  One girl said they had a really old chandelier in her house.  <br/>\nYeah, like pre-electricity. Turns out the oldest part of her house was from <br/>\nthe late 18th century, then had 19th century add on and 20th century upgrades.  <br/>\n That was most definitely not in the northeast heights.  The really old <br/>\nchandelier had been there since it was installed, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne  kid  cited as the oldest item in his house a certain Grateful Dead album <br/>\nhis dad owned. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then my point would end up being that the words they use every day are <br/>\nolder than all that stuff.  They&#39;d call out a word from the dictionary and I&#39;d <br/>\ntell them what language it came into English from.  I won three rounds and lost <br/>\ntwo.   Then I&#39;d tell them how I was figuring them out, that it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nmemorization or guessing, and I&#39;d call words to them that they could &quot;guess,&quot; so that <br/>\nthey saw it wasn&#39;t guessing.  They&#39;re doing Spain and the Moors and though I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know a lot about words that came into Spanish (or English) from Arabic <br/>\nlanguages, there are a few we came across and the teacher was collecting those, <br/>\nwhile my main stories involved the Norman Conquest and the <br/>\nEnglish/French/Norse tales, and how Latin terms came to be in English even though English is a <br/>\nGermanic language.  It was a lot to cover in 39 minutes.  Couldn&#39;t believe <br/>\ntheir periods were only 39 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it it used to be just rich white kids from the heights, it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto be now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the review for my long day of teaching","postDate":"1075443134","msgId":18581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwMTlGNUJFLjUwMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyZC4zOWYwMGM1Ni4yZDRhOTU5OEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyZC4zOWYwMGM1Ni4yZDRhOTU5OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18557,"nextInTopic":18592,"prevInTime":18580,"nextInTime":18582,"topicId":18533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh Yes, Prep.   :-) Where all the rich white kids from the heights went.
