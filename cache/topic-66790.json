And you don&#39;t want to do that either. So you&#39;ll let him handle the situations between him and the kids and you&#39;ll handle the situations between you and the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids try to go around him, let them know calmly and sweetly that it&#39;s between him and them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, the more you can change the atmosphere so he&#39;s not getting into such situations, the fewer he&#39;ll have to deal with and the more patience he&#39;ll have for the ones he does end up in. The more you can side track, before they get to the point where he&#39;s getting upset, the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso involve them in the process. Let them know the things that bother him and help them think ahead and do those things before he gets home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there some specific examples you can give?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"Alysia","from":"Alysia &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"When your partner does things differently was Re: DH wants limits now on media","postDate":"1334440374","msgId":66790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzQ0NDAzNzQuMTk2NjIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjQ1OTEzLm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66791,"prevInTime":66789,"nextInTime":66791,"topicId":66790,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==there were many times I bit my tongue or wandered off to another room because I could see (or thought I could see) what was coming with the way he was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1915368086\">==there were many times I bit my tongue or wandered off to another room because I could see (or thought I<br/>\ncould see) what was coming with the way he was interacting.==<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ve been doing this a lot but it&#39;s really hard sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==I learned that he and the kids would often work things out their ways - and<br/>\nit might involve more unhappiness in the moment than if I&#39;d been<br/>\nengineering it but that they developed skills that made their relationships<br/>\nreally really good as time passed.== <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand that I need to let my husband establish his own relationship with the kids with their own rules and boundaries but I also feel the need to protect and save my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==What would you want him to step in and do, really?
