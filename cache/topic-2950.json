It is the hardest waiting, and thinking.  I remember <br/>\nlaying in my backyard thinking OMG life might change tomorrow or the <br/>\nnext day.  I knew I would make myself crazy with the wild <br/>\nimaginations so I got busy..I wrote cards to people that I knew <br/>\nneeded encouragement, baked casseroles for families that needed help, <br/>\nwent to the libary, Science Center, worked(hard)in the <br/>\ngarden....anything not to think about all the possibilities.  And I <br/>\ntook Valerian (it is a herb) to help me sleep. Deep breathing helps <br/>\nthe stress too. Mine turned out ok,  I do have some abnormal cells <br/>\nthat need to be monitored, but so far everthing is ok.  I hope that <br/>\nall will be well for you and your family....And please do not feel <br/>\nguilty for the way you are feeling toward MIL, feelings are just that <br/>\nfeelings, no sense adding in a heap of guilt...<br/>\n<br/>\nPrayers and hugs<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2930,"nextTopicId":2953}}
