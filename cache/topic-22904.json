Unfortunately, we were just settling into unschooling, and I <br/>\nwas finally feeling like we had some sense of family balance and <br/>\nharmony.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my son and daughter were evaluated by a vision therapist. We <br/>\nwere just beginning our unschooling journey after homeschooling for <br/>\na few years. We were definitely not whole-life unschooling yet. I <br/>\nmention this because if I were in the same situation today I <br/>\nprobably would not even have them evaluated at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nI had heard about vision therapy from my SIL. The reason I had my <br/>\nson evaluated was because he hated reading at 10 - he had learned to <br/>\nread in school - he went through 2nd grade. I just couldn&#39;t get<br/>\nhow someone could hate reading and I was worried. . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky because our vision therapist was a homeschooler (she had <br/>\nher practice 2.5 days a week and her husband did whatever he did for <br/>\n2.5 days). I let her know that we didn&#39;t do formal lessons and<br/>\nthat I wasn&#39;t pushing academics. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had focusing problems and double vision (neither of which was <br/>\ncaught in the regular eye exams he had had) and maybe a couple other <br/>\nthings - can&#39;t remember now. She recommended either exercises or <br/>\nglasses for &quot;close work&quot;. He chose the glasses and wore them<br/>\nfor about a year - mostly while playing Legos. I&#39;m sure I was a<br/>\nnag about wearing them since we hadn&#39;t reached whole-life <br/>\nunschooling nirvana yet.  &lt;g&gt;  After that year he was evaluated and <br/>\nall his vision issues were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my daughter evaluated when she was 6 or maybe 7 because I <br/>\nheard that the vision problems could be hereditary.  Since our <br/>\ntherapist knew I wasn&#39;t concerned about early reading she<br/>\nsuggested exercises to improve focus (and other things but I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember what they were either  sorry) but not to push.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Now, though, it feels like it is all going down the tubes <br/>\nbecause we have to get certain things done everyday - and the <br/>\nactivities are challenging for him, and sometimes not all that fun. <br/>\nWe have to do basically 4 activities for 8 minutes a peice. What <br/>\nshould take a little over half an hour takes us what feels like <br/>\nforever! He is miserable and doesn&#39;t want to do anything now.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYup  that is exactly what happened here. The exercises lasted<br/>\nabout 3 days. We never did them again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadelyn had two or three evaluations about a year apart and each <br/>\nshowed improvement. The last one, when she was maybe 11 or 12, <br/>\nshowed that she had no vision problems. The vision therapist had <br/>\nsuggested that she would probably outgrow the problems and she did.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  This is really frustrating because if we don&#39;t do the Vision <br/>\nTherapy, he may never be able to see normally.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could let it go for a year and have him evaluated again. <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t feel comfortable with that or if your son is<br/>\nexpressing distress about his vision, at least get a second opinion <br/>\nfrom a therapist who understands that reading at 6 and doing <br/>\nschoolwork aren&#39;t top priorities for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMercedes<br/>\nwho just read this response to Madelyn and she says it was alot <br/>\nlonger than three days  :-(</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135609248,"authorName":"Julie W","from":"Julie W &lt;jjjwoolfolk@...&gt;","profile":"juliewinar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with Vision Therapy","postDate":"1124382106","msgId":22909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzMDRCNTlBLjkwNTAxMDJAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRkdGRnNis2bHMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRkdGRnNis2bHMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22908,"nextInTopic":22911,"prevInTime":22908,"nextInTime":22910,"topicId":22904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Josh (13) really needs to wear glasses (or contacts) but he <br/>\nrefuses to do it. It is just for one eye. Contacts are too &quot;hard to put <br/>\nin&quot; even with smaller ones. Glasses are &quot;uncomfortable&quot;...no kidding? <br/>\nI&#39;ve worn them for about 35 years. So he does without and he really has <br/>\na hard time reading and writing, but he is not interested in doing <br/>\nanything about it, I read things for him, but he does get frustrated <br/>\nwith the wait times, but he does not want to try anything to help and <br/>\nwell it is just a vicious cycle.

It was a 3D thing.  No matter how much I tried, my brain/eyes just<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it.  It was incredibly frustrating, and I was an adult.  Even<br/>\nthe doctor got frustrated.  Usually he had assistants do the exercises when<br/>\nI had my visit, but after more than a month of no progress he started to do<br/>\nthem with me - it was almost as if he couldn&#39;t believe it and had to see<br/>\nfor himself.  I remember feeling totally inadequate because I just couldn&#39;t<br/>\ntell which stupid sheep was closer to bo peep!!  Then one day all of a<br/>\nsudden it jumped out at me and I was able to do the exercise.  It took a<br/>\nlot of determination for me to stick with it.  I&#39;m glad I did, because it<br/>\nhelped me with my vision immensely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine a 6yo being able to do what I did to stick with it.  It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t fun, it was frustrating.  But, having the vision difficulties in my<br/>\nlife was more frustrating, so I was willing to do the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few years ago I did them again because I was noticing that I had<br/>\ngone back to some older habits.  The 3D exercise was totally easy, but some<br/>\nof the others were difficult again.  What this 2nd doctor said was that I<br/>\ncould do the exercises at my own pace, but that the improvements would come<br/>\nsooner if I did the exercises every day.  In a way it was all about how<br/>\nquickly I wanted to see the changes and how many visits I wanted to pay<br/>\nfor.  The more &quot;homework&quot; I did, the fewer visits I would have.  You might<br/>\nwant to see if this would also be true for your son&#39;s program.  If so, then<br/>\ntake a slower pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I suggest that you find out exactly what the parameters are for &quot;having<br/>\nto&quot; do the Vision Therapy.  I did mine when I was in my early 20s.  Not to<br/>\nsay that his issues aren&#39;t urgent and need correcting, but exactly when<br/>\nwill it be too late and why??  Maybe it isn&#39;t as urgent as it might seem.<br/>\nI&#39;m going to guess that the urgency isn&#39;t so much about the health of the<br/>\nchild or some technical medical reason -- but more about how he&#39;ll need to<br/>\nhave the vision corrected before he will be able to read... and well...<br/>\nthere&#39;s no need to rush that!!  Maybe I&#39;m wrong, maybe some visioning<br/>\npattern will be set in place that will hard to correct if his vision isn&#39;t<br/>\nfixed early on...
