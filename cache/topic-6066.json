Actually, Kathleen is here in<br/>\n&gt;VA right now with us doing Fiddler.  She just got in town last week and<br/>\n&gt;started rehearsing with us on Tuesday.  It was already so much fun with<br/>\n&gt;Jeanne, the VA director, but now with Kathleen here too, it&#39;s so cool!<br/>\n&gt;I mispoke in my last e-mail for the sake of conciseness.  Kathleen was<br/>\n&gt;actually the only one who started YPT here, but Jeanne joined her the<br/>\n&gt;first season and soon became her partner.  Since there are people on<br/>\n&gt;this group who actually know these people, I thought I should state it<br/>\n&gt;correctly!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know Kathleen considers Jeanne her partner through and through, so it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really matter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize she was leaving so soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell her Karen in Memphis said hello!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5955,"nextTopicId":6035}}
