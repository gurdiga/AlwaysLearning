I can attest that I could never  <br/>\ntrain that way again.  Fortunately, there is lots of research out  <br/>\nthere that supports training dogs (all animals, actually) using  <br/>\npositive reinforcement and clicker methods.  We got a 7 month old lab  <br/>\npuppy when my oldest was almost 4.5, my middle son was almost 2 and I  <br/>\nwas pregnant with my 3d.  Casey came from a positive reinforcement/ <br/>\nclicker training breeder, so she was trained, but I still had to put  <br/>\nin LOTS of time and energy to continue the training and to get used to  <br/>\nhow to train that way myself, not to mention work with her on how to  <br/>\nnot use my kids as bowling pins (she was a BIG girl at 7 mntsh LOL).   <br/>\nI can now attest that this training is WAY more in line with our  <br/>\npeaceful, respectful lives and that Casey is a happy member of our  <br/>\nfamily.  We love having her so much we are considering getting a 10  <br/>\nweek old puppy in December.  Another lab and from a line that is laid  <br/>\nback (show line) and this one has been hand reared due to low milk  <br/>\nsupply.  I am told the whole little is very people friendly as a  <br/>\nresult.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, now 6.5 has expressed interest in doing some training with  <br/>\nme.  He is not obligated, or responsible to do so in any way though.   <br/>\nJust if he wants.  He has trained Casey and loves asking her to sit or  <br/>\ndown and then clicks the clicker and tosses her a treat.  No jerking  <br/>\nleashes around here!
