My kids and I love paper dolls, but<br/>\nthey rip so easily.  I had the magnetic David and Venus on the fridge<br/>\nfor a long time,  but the kids loved them to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just ordered printable magnetic sheets from Staples and found a bunch<br/>\nof free paper doll (including some boy dolls) sites to download!  We are<br/>\ngoing to have a blast with these.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, thanks to the person who gave directions for goop (or whatever it<br/>\nwas called - was that here or the other group?), my kids and I have been<br/>\nhaving fun with it too.  A little gross for me, but they are loving it -<br/>\nso much so that we have run out of food coloring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just found out today that there has been enough rain here to fill up<br/>\nmy favorite swimming hole!  Yea!  So we&#39;ll be spending time out there<br/>\nthis summer.  The beach, the swimming hole - who needs a pool?<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14293,"nextTopicId":14381}}
