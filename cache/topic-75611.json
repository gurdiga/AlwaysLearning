I have good friends and family members who are very vocal against vaccination (and some who are very vocal for vaccination). We (adults) are able to have respectful discussions that lead to mutual understanding even when we disagree. Our kids play together, and vaccines have not come up yet for them. Is it possible to have a gentle discussion with your family member who has mistakenly made a flippant comment in front of your child?</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, I have seen (mostly online) that vaccine discussions can take a downward spiral into nonsensical or mean accusations quickly. Vaccinating parents are called “sheeple.” Non-vaccinating parents are called “stupid” or “selfish.” Doctors and scientists are called “greedy” or “pawns of Big Pharma.” These types of statements are unhelpful. If people become hostile and unyielding, I am learning that it’s better to just not engage. Just walk away. Enjoy time with my kids instead. Don’t let that negativity into my home.

I understand there are many ways people can come up with the impression that doctors’ beliefs come from pharmaceutical companies. But no one can really say this is true without being in the doctor’s head. Maybe I have issue with the phrase “comes from.” I would agree if the phrase were replaced with “can be influenced by.”<br/>\n<br/>\nI often hear big generalizations about doctors that don’t jive with my experience in training and in practice. People in other fields probably experience this also. It’s kind of like how some unschoolers might feel when outsiders say that unschoolers are permissive and un-parenting because of the examples they’ve seen. Or when people make comments about Sandra and unschoolers in general after reading snippets of what she said.

I was actually thinking of other issues that are more related to unschooling - diets, not letting kids play in the front yard or climb trees, stuff like that, where parents tell children to avoid things because of high perceived risk. I think I am bringing in too many different ideas here at once, which is causing confusion.

This list is great at pointing out when there is another point of view to be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nJanice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 16, 2015, at 3:10 PM, Sandra Dodd <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Much of what doctors believe comes from pharmaceutical reps or reports from pharmaceutical research. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sort of.

That’s part of how I found unschooling - by tearing apart all of those research articles that try to show the harms of television.

Nothing in life is 100%, (except dying and taxes, as the saying goes). There are people who believe that the Earth does not revolve around the Sun. All of that footage of us going to the moon could have been fabricated. There are people who believe that Ebola was invented by Westerners to bring suffering to Africa. There are people who believe that AIDS is caused by the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. Can any of us say with 100% certainty whether any of these things are true?

People in the medical field have mainstream views of children, so vaccinations are often given without any sensitivity towards the children. Parents are often instructed to hold their children down despite screams. Some parents trick and lie to their children about what will happen in the doctor’s office. Some parents have no empathy for their kids who have just experienced pain. No wonder some parents notice a change in their kids’ behavior after the vaccine, then they blame it on vaccine ingredients instead of looking at how they just treated their child. Thankfully, as unschoolers, we have the compassion and tools to help our children so that it does not have to be a traumatic experience for them. I’d love for the research dollars to go into how to make the whole experience less traumatic for families.</div><div><br></div><div>Janice</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Feb 16, 2015, at 7:16 AM, Joyce Fetteroll <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-interchange-newline\"><blockquote type=\"cite\"><div style=\"font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-msg\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583ygrp-text\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;\"><p style=\"line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt; On Feb 13, 2015, at 12:44 PM, Janice Ancheta<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janice_casamina@...\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;font-family:Verdana;\">janice_casamina@...</a><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>wrote:<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-725189583Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt; As Joyce said, you can make information available to your son.<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">Just to be clear, I was picturing a young adult ready to go off into the world needing information.

I cannot say here what the right answer is in this or any other individual situation.</div><div><br></div><div>As Joyce said, you can make information available to your son. Most people will agree that it is important to be informed. But when it comes to vaccines, if you look for information by doing a google search, there is a good chance you and your son will be misinformed. The internet and even some books are filled with folklore, half-truths, and flat out lies about vaccines. There are even whole websites and organizations designed to look official and scientific, but are actually all smoke and mirrors. But it’s hard to tell unless you have a solid understanding of epidemiology and immunology, and you click on all the links and references on these sites.</div><div><br></div><div>In the United States, go straight to the CDC website&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/parents-guide/parents-guide-part4.html</a>. No organization (including the CDC) is perfect, but it’s the best source of actual data here. Discuss anything you don’t understand or any frightening rumors you hear with a trusted physician or other expert in the field.</div><div><br></div><div>I am not saying this to you specifically, but to everyone as a source for discussion. I think you move away from unschooling when you hold onto beliefs that are not supported by evidence, then impose these beliefs on your children as truths. Don’t believe whatever you read on the internet without checking sources. Don&#39;t believe that you are “educated” on a topic by reading a blog post while ignoring a large body of evidence. Experts can be wrong, but if you are going to say so, please be able to give real evidence as to why you think they are wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>I think if anyone really wants to learn about vaccines, study immunology, virology, epidemiology, anatomy and physiology, public health, etc. If not, see the CDC website and talk to people who are experts in these subjects. Don’t rely on internet lore.</div><div><br></div><div>Janice</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div><div>On Feb 13, 2015, at 5:28 AM, Joyce Fetteroll <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-interchange-newline\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\"><div style=\"font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-msg\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821ygrp-text\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;\"><p style=\"line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt; On Feb 12, 2015, at 10:23 PM,<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treesock@...\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;font-family:Verdana;\">treesock@...</a><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>wrote:<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1048835821Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">&gt; I want to be his ally and advocate, and a good mom and good citizen, too.<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">Setting aside the controversial issues about vaccines, some of these diseases can affect adults more seriously than when caught as a child.<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">But, in the meantime, what are the chances your son will get one of these disease before he&#39;s an adult?
