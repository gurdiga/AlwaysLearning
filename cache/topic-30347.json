(Sandra has <br/>\nmentioned that this helped her husband when she had little ones.)  If <br/>\nhe needs more than that, you could also outline for him a way that <br/>\nyou plan to strew or offer (but not push or force) something that <br/>\nconnects to that bit of learning so as to broaden your kids&#39; world a <br/>\nbit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also remind him, that if he&#39;s worried about any of the <br/>\nthree being neglected at home, that at school there would be at least <br/>\n15 and possibly more like 30.  And even though they&#39;re the same <br/>\nchronological age, many teachers will tell you that their kids span <br/>\nat least six &quot;grade levels&quot; in any single grade class, so what&#39;s <br/>\nbeing done in the classroom will not necessarily be tailored to her <br/>\nlevel and most certainly not to her interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if your husband really means what I&#39;m hearing:  that he <br/>\nwants to plan where your child will wind up in some set amount of <br/>\ntime?  I can understand someone new to unschooling being concerned <br/>\nthat their kids grow up to be happy, self supporting, contributing <br/>\nmembers of society.  But if that&#39;s the worry, I think he needs <br/>\nreassurance by learning about grown unschoolers, not a plan for what <br/>\nyour kid will do when.  There&#39;s a quote, I think from John Holt, <br/>\nthat&#39;s often cited in this sort of discussion, that if you wait until <br/>\na kid is 15 or 16, all the 13 years of K-12 learning can be done in <br/>\n18 months.  Maybe that will help him relax a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking about this bit you said, Jen:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The reason I thought that was interesting was that, in general, I have<br/>\nfound that to be true for me as well. Usually when I approach<br/>\nsomething, whether it&#39;s the laundry or a career change, I have some<br/>\nsort of goal or plan - or even steps to follow - in mind.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  I think that&#39;s true for most of us, when we know what we want to <br/>\ndo.  I see my children do it all the time.  But it&#39;s often after a <br/>\nperiod that looks very unplanned, unfocused and like they don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat they want to do.  And that&#39;s true for myself as well.  I have <br/>\nperiods where I flounder, but then I figure out what I want to do and <br/>\ndo it.  I actually think those floundering periods are valuable.  I <br/>\nthink of it as &quot;brain stewing:&quot;  sometimes ideas need time to simmer <br/>\nawhile before they really come together.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Tellew<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: My husband&#39;s concerns","postDate":"1188237911","msgId":30362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwODI3MTEwNWs3NmVjYzViZmdkZjcxZTcyMTBjMjNkODgwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwODI3MTc1NjA1LjEwOTYxLnFtYWlsQHNlcnZlcjMxNi5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDcwODI3MTc1NjA1LjEwOTYxLnFtYWlsQHNlcnZlcjMxNi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30361,"nextInTopic":30366,"prevInTime":30361,"nextInTime":30363,"topicId":30347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
