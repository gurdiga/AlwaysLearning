The cards are placed in the centre of a group of players. A decision is made as to who goes 1st based on anything such as height, aged, hair length, noise ability etc. The 1st player picks up the top card saying &quot;tick tack top&quot; , then tells a joke based on the character on the card. We used Winny the Pooh cards so that if you picked up Winny the Pooh you could tell a joke based on the character on about bears. If the player forgets to say tick tac top or says it wrong then the player has to make the noise the character makes or how it may sound when eating and misses telling the joke.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig says this is a game for any age and it is just for fun with no winners or losers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope you al enjoy it as much as we have<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove from Jay & Martin parents to Axel and Craig <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know how children feel because we feel the same way.  However when  we do not respect children&#39;s feelings it is because ours  were not respected when we were children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 266.6.2 - Release Date: 04/03/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21859,"nextTopicId":21860}}
