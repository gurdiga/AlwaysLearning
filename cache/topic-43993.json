I excerpted<br/>\nsome of summary, and my comment is in brackets like these []:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I put forward the hypothesis that the major cause of PN<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[psychological neoteny, which means delayed maturity or something like that]<br/>\nin modernizing societies is the prolonged duration of formal education. Here<br/>\nI present a preliminary empirical investigation of this hypothesis of<br/>\npsychological neoteny. Marriage and parenthood are indicative of making a<br/>\nchoice to �settle down� and thereby move on from the more flexible lifestyle<br/>\nof youth; and furthermore these are usually commitments which themselves<br/>\ninduce a settling down and maturation of attitudes and behaviors. A<br/>\nsevenfold expansion of participation in UK higher education up to 2001 was<br/>\nreflected in delay in marriage and parenthood. Increasing number of years of<br/>\neducation is quantitatively the most important predictor of increasing age<br/>\nof the mother at the time of her first birth: among women college graduates<br/>\nabout half are aged 30 or older at the time of their first birth � a rise of<br/>\n400% in 25 years. Parenthood is associated with a broad range of<br/>\npsychologically �maturing� and socially-integrating effects in both men and<br/>\nwomen. However, the economic effect is different in men and women: after<br/>\nparenthood men are more likely to have a job and work more hours while women<br/>\nchange in the opposite direction. The conclusion is that psychological<br/>\nneoteny is indeed increasing, and mainly as a consequence of the increasing<br/>\npercentage of school leavers going into higher education. But at present it<br/>\nis unclear whether this trend is overall beneficial or harmful; and the<br/>\nanswer may be different for men and women. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like I need a subscription or student/faculty status to see the<br/>\nwhole thing.
