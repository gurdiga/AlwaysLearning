Brilliant!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, no examples are coming to my after 40 mind right now, but my son and I both <br/>\nenjoy pointing them out when we see them.  It&#39;s fun for me that he&#39;s seeing his own--it used <br/>\nto be just me pointing them out, beginning of course, with all the stories that draw from the  <br/>\nJ. R. R. Tolkien well.  Sometimes I see a character, and I just know that the author had read <br/>\nthe same book, etc., and I feel this great intellectual connection.  References like that are like <br/>\na library of common language.
