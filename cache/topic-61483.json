If people know of other discussion sites where topics are hoppin&#39;, feel free to share those links as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in England at the moment, because my anchoress status is only keeping me away from the SCA, not keeping me in my house. :-) I&#39;ve been to Scotland and will go to France next week. I&#39;m here for home-ed purposes (what the Brits call homeschooling), and am keeping notes and photos here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com\">http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra (AElflaed, to more people here)<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone I don&#39;t know posted this response:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\nPlease make sure to do something more than the home-schooling activities.

Or a boat enthusiast, or horseman, or a fan of trains or automobiles.   Pictures of all kinds of places and things are free to see on the internet.  I can&#39;t keep sharable images of all that I&#39;ve seen, but taking pictures was one of my top three priorities.   Photos, blogging, speaking (honoring my commitments to speak).  Then travelling and meeting people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe photos in that blog were taken in the company of, or in the homes of, home-schooling families who are unschoolers.  If that doesn&#39;t mean anything to you, the image you had when you recommended I do &quot;something more than the home-schooling activities&quot; is probably not the image unschoolers have of the world and of learning.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting to me that someone who is in a club that involves learning and doing difficult things for fun, who additionally joined a discussion list to discuss philosophical aspects of that, is advising me about doing &quot;something more than...&quot; and what pictures to take. :-)   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61242,"nextTopicId":61491}}
