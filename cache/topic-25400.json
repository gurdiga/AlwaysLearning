Go where you can skip  <br/>\nstones on water, or throw rocks off a hill where nobody&#39;s around  <br/>\n(that latter one&#39;s easy in New Mexico).

I want us to<br/>\nhave a peaceful household and I want them all to feel safe, even when<br/>\nthere&#39;s conflict.  I ask them how we can all feel safe when there&#39;s a<br/>\ndisagreement and they agree that controling our anger and expressing it with<br/>\nwords rather than our hands is the best way for everyone to feel safe and<br/>\nsecure.   We also talk about other ways to resolve conflict.  We talk about<br/>\nhow everyone&#39;s feeling and why in order to model empathy.  We brainstorm<br/>\nabout possible solutions.  I tell them, in the end, that if the only thing<br/>\nthey can think of in the moment is to hit or hit back, they should come to<br/>\nme and I&#39;ll help them figure out how to resolve the conflict without<br/>\nresorting to violence.  You know, when they do come to me, sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\nhard for *me* to figure out a peaceful solution that satisfies everyone.  It<br/>\noften seems impossible.

My oldest is 8 and rarely hits or<br/>\nlashes out physically anymore, even when his brothers hurt him.  He has to<br/>\nbe in major emotional upheaval to lash out, and, thankfully, those are very<br/>\nfew and far between these days.  I guess I&#39;ve come to an acceptance that<br/>\nthey will hit each other, and I count on our example (and now, the example<br/>\nof our oldest) along with lots and lots of repetition and brainstorming to<br/>\neventually show them what we value and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest lesson I needed to learn in parenting is that it&#39;s less<br/>\nimportant to know what the perfect solution is and more important to *not*<br/>\ndo what I know *doesn&#39;t* work and *isn&#39;t* right.
