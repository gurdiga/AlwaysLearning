Mainland, Elnahal said, does <br/>\nnot<br/>\nencourage intellectual thought and the exchange of ideas.<br/>\nThe senior, in a detailed speech that referenced philosphers and ethics<br/>\nprinciples, referred to his education as &quot;entirely hollow.&quot; The speech <br/>\nwas<br/>\ninterrupted by the principal, and Elnahal cut his remarks short and <br/>\nleft the<br/>\nceremony.<br/>\nMainland principal Robert Blake said the speech insulted Elnahal&#39;s<br/>\nclassmates.<br/>\n&quot;That was so hypocritical of him to make that statement,&quot; Blake said. <br/>\n&quot;It<br/>\nwas an insult to everyone here at this school ... he made inflammatory<br/>\ncomments about the school in general.&quot;<br/>\nReached at his home Wednesday, Elnahal said he regrets the way the <br/>\nsituation<br/>\nunfolded. He was embarassed and apologetic.<br/>\n&quot;I put the principal in a very uncomfortable position - he&#39;s a very nice<br/>\nguy, actually - I feel bad,&quot; Elnahal said. &quot;I feel bad that he had to <br/>\ndeal<br/>\nwith this.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I just wanted to finish up, I felt pretty guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt<br/>\nembarassed that the ceremony had to happen this way. It&#39;s supposed to <br/>\nbe a<br/>\nday of celebration.&quot;<br/>\nAt the same time, Elnahal said he is glad he had the opportunity to <br/>\nmake his<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n&quot;I went to two parties last night, and I&#39;m their hero now,&quot; he said.<br/>\n&quot;I felt like this was the right thing to do,&quot; Elnahal said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nshow<br/>\nthe speech (to officials) beforehand because they would have rejected <br/>\nit. I<br/>\ncould tell by the reaction from students that they felt the same way. I <br/>\nhad<br/>\nto express it or I felt that nothing would change.&quot;<br/>\nIn Elnahal&#39;s original approved speech, he was to touch on the high and <br/>\nlow<br/>\npoints of school and the experiences that moved the class to maturity. <br/>\nBut<br/>\nonce he took the podium, Elnahal changed gears and began to speak about <br/>\nthe<br/>\nshortcomings of the American education system - specifically, at <br/>\nMainland, a<br/>\nschool that prides itself as being one of the premier area high <br/>\nschools.<br/>\n&quot;In my reflection ... and I have reflected on this a great deal, I found<br/>\nthat many of life&#39;s important questions are ignored here,&quot; Elnahal said,<br/>\naccording to a copy of the alternate speech he provided to The Press.<br/>\nHe went on to say, &quot;I speak today not to rant, complain or cause <br/>\ntrouble ...<br/>\nrather, I was moved by the countless hours wasted in those halls.&quot;<br/>\nBlake said he and other administrators realized after a few moments that<br/>\nElnahal&#39;s speech was different than what was approved. Blake said he<br/>\napproached Elnahal, let him know he was disappointed with what he was<br/>\nsaying, and asked him to wrap up his speech.<br/>\nElnahal described the incident the same way.<br/>\nAfter he finished the speech, Elnahal walked off the stage and left the<br/>\nschool grounds by his own choice.<br/>\n&quot;I thought it would be better for the ceremony to go on without me,&quot; he<br/>\nsaid.<br/>\nBlake noted that the very education system Elnahal criticized helped <br/>\nhim get<br/>\ninto Princeton University.<br/>\n&quot;He conveyed that he felt his education was worthless,&quot; Blake said. &quot;We <br/>\nhave<br/>\nan outstanding education system here.&quot;<br/>\nBlake said the audience had a mixed reaction to Elnahal&#39;s comments. Some<br/>\nyelled comments regarding freedom of speech after the speech was<br/>\ninterrupted. Blake said he heard some students cheering and applauding<br/>\nElnahal&#39;s comments.<br/>\n&quot;I truly don&#39;t believe they understood what he was saying,&quot; Blake said. <br/>\n&quot;My<br/>\nhope was they did not hear or understand what he was saying. Whether it <br/>\nwas<br/>\nintentional or not, he was belittling the diplomas of every one of those<br/>\nkids.&quot;<br/>\nBlake said that as with every valedictorian&#39;s speech, there is a <br/>\nprocess of<br/>\nreview to make sure the speech is appropriate. Elnahal&#39;s original <br/>\nspeech was<br/>\napproved.<br/>\n&quot;This is a school (sanctioned) program,&quot; Blake said. &quot;We give them <br/>\nlatitude.<br/>\nHowever, to say inflammatory things - no, I won&#39;t allow that. We have<br/>\nseveral thousand people in the stands.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;He has a right to his comments, but he shouldn&#39;t have been using that<br/>\npulpit to put forth his limited viewpoint,&quot; Blake said. &quot;Hopefully <br/>\npeople<br/>\nkept it in context.&quot;<br/>\nDavid Hudson, a research attorney at First Amendment Center, said it is<br/>\ndifficult to say in a situation like this who is right and who is wrong.<br/>\n&quot;The question becomes whether (the student&#39;s) speech is student <br/>\ninitiated or<br/>\nschool sponsored,&quot; Hudson said. &quot;It&#39;s a hazy issue.&quot;<br/>\nHudson noted that students do not have full First Ammendment <br/>\nprotection, and<br/>\ndo not have the right to say whatever they want at a school event.<br/>\nBut at the same time, disliking a student&#39;s speech is not a reason to <br/>\nstop<br/>\nit, Hudson said. If there was substantial concern that the student&#39;s <br/>\nwords<br/>\ncould cause a problem, then someone has a right to step in, Hudson said.<br/>\nBlake said that Elnahal&#39;s diploma still is at Mainland. He has not yet<br/>\ncontacted the school about obtaining it.<br/>\n&quot;I guess I have to go pick it up,&quot; Elnahal said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Press of Atlantic City chose to run the young man&#39;s speech <br/>\nfollowing the<br/>\nabove article:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nELNAHAL&#39;S SPEECH<br/>\n<br/>\nFour years ago, we gathered here for an education. Today marks a <br/>\nmilestone<br/>\nin that pursuit, a culmination of four years of learning, growth and <br/>\nshared<br/>\nmemories. At such times, it is appropriate to reflect on years past, to<br/>\nexamine what we have done and what we have learned. Today I am charged <br/>\nwith<br/>\nthat difficult task, and I would like to thank the school for the<br/>\nopportunity to stand before my peers and reflect on our time together.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducation can be defined a number of different ways. For me, it is the<br/>\nproduct of human curiosity. Intellectual thought, as far as I can tell, <br/>\nis<br/>\nnothing but the asking and answering of questions. In my reflection,<br/>\nhowever, and I have reflected on this a great deal, I found that many of<br/>\nlife&#39;s most important questions are ignored here. What is the right way <br/>\nto<br/>\nlive? What is the ideal society? What principles should guide my <br/>\nbehavior?<br/>\nWhat is success, what is failure? Is there a creator, and if so, should <br/>\nwe<br/>\nlook to it for guidance? These are often dismissed as questions of <br/>\nreligion,<br/>\nbut religion is not something opposed to rationality, it simply seeks to<br/>\nanswer such questions through faith. The separation of church and state <br/>\nis,<br/>\nof course, important, but it should never be a reason for intellectual<br/>\nsubmission or suppression of any kind. Ethics - it is what defines us - <br/>\nas<br/>\nindividuals, as a society - and yet it is never discussed, never <br/>\nexplained,<br/>\nnever justified. Rousseau, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Aquinas,<br/>\nnearly every major writer I&#39;ve encountered devotes time to the subject. <br/>\nAnd<br/>\nit&#39;s not as if these questions are without practical concern, that they <br/>\nare<br/>\nless immediately relevant than science for instance. Our laws, our<br/>\ninstitutions and all our actions are a reflection of our ethics. Our own<br/>\nsociety owes itself to the writers of the enlightenment, but we never <br/>\nprobe<br/>\ntheir work - we fail to espouse the movement&#39;s central principle, doubt <br/>\n-<br/>\ndoubt everything. We study what is, never why, never what should be. For<br/>\nthat reason, the education we have received here is not only <br/>\nincomplete, it<br/>\nis entirely hollow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s more, this same lack of focus can be found in many of the <br/>\nsubjects we<br/>\ndo study. We approach history as though it were a story, endlessly<br/>\ncataloging every major character or event. But the details of that <br/>\nstory are<br/>\ninsignificant - what is significant is the progression of ideas. A <br/>\nstudy of<br/>\nhistory should get some sense of how the society he sees around him<br/>\ndeveloped from those built thousands of years ago, what ideas changed <br/>\nand<br/>\nwhat changed them. When humanist scholars looked into ancient Rome <br/>\nduring<br/>\nthe Renaissance, they searched for moral examples, for ideas. They <br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\nmull on every single daily event. They were inspired, and they <br/>\ntransformed<br/>\nsociety. History is not an end in itself; it should act as a tool for<br/>\ngreater thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not only history. I&#39;ve taken a literature class nearly every <br/>\nyear<br/>\nof my life, but never has a question so basic as &quot;What is good writing?&quot;<br/>\ncome up. Literary technique, what should be the focus of the class, is <br/>\nnever<br/>\ndiscussed. How does an author develop plot? How can an author control <br/>\nmood<br/>\nor tone in his writing? What is the advantage of one author&#39;s methods <br/>\nover<br/>\nanother&#39;s? Such matters are never discussed. We read for the sake of<br/>\nreading, to talk about our interpretations in class as though we were <br/>\nin a<br/>\nbook club. But no attention is paid to why we read the books we do, what<br/>\nmakes them so special. And this pattern, grade for the sake of a grade, <br/>\nwork<br/>\nfor the sake of work, can be found everywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, the<br/>\nspirit of intellectual thought is lost. I speak today not to rant, <br/>\ncomplain<br/>\nor cause trouble, and certainly not to draw attention to myself. I have<br/>\naccomplished nothing and I am nothing. I know that. Rather, I was moved <br/>\nby<br/>\nthe countless hours wasted in those halls. Today, you should focus on <br/>\nyour<br/>\nchild or loved one. This is meant to be a day of celebration, and if <br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\ntaken away from that, I&#39;m sorry. But I know how highly this community <br/>\nvalues<br/>\nlearning, and I urge you all to re-evaluate what it means to be <br/>\neducated. I<br/>\ncare deeply about everyone here, and it is only our fulfillment I <br/>\ndesire. I<br/>\nwill leave now so that the ceremony can go on. Again, my deepest <br/>\napologies,<br/>\nGod help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following article is from today&#39;s Press of Atlantic City&#39;s (New <br/>\nJersey)<br/>\nEditorial Section:<br/>\n<br/>\nMAINLAND&#39;S VALEDICTORIAN<br/>\n<br/>\nHe proved his point<br/>\nPublished: Friday, June 23, 2006<br/>\nUpdated: Friday, June 23, 2006<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine the nerve ... a high-school valedictorian, on his way to <br/>\nPrinceton<br/>\nnext year, daring to speak about a topic he obviously has given much <br/>\nthought<br/>\nto - the American education system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt beats the more typical &quot;We are all astronauts on the spaceship to<br/>\ntomorrow&quot; speech, if you ask us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the unapproved speech that Mainland Regional High School<br/>\nvaledictorian Kareem Elnahal tried to deliver before he was hustled off <br/>\nthe<br/>\nstage by Principal Robert Blake was rather thoughtful and quite <br/>\ninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, schools have a right and a responsibility to screen graduation<br/>\nspeeches. But Elnahal&#39;s speech wasn&#39;t a puerile rant filled with <br/>\nexpletives<br/>\n- it was an on-the-money critique of the public education system. In <br/>\nfact,<br/>\nboth Mark Twain (&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my<br/>\neducation&quot;) and, slightly more crudely, Paul Simon (&quot;When I look back <br/>\non all<br/>\nthe crap I learned in high school, it&#39;s a wonder I can think at all&quot;) <br/>\nhave<br/>\noffered similar critiques.<br/>\n<br/>\nMainland officials simply proved Elnahal&#39;s point by not letting him give<br/>\nthis speech. Listen to what he said:<br/>\n<br/>\nn &quot;Education can be defined a number of different ways. For me, it is <br/>\nthe<br/>\nproduct of human curiosity. Intellectual thought, as far as I can tell, <br/>\nis<br/>\nnothing but the asking and answering of questions. In my reflection, <br/>\nhowever<br/>\n... I found that many of life&#39;s most important questions are ignored <br/>\nhere.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nn &quot;We approach history as though it were a story, endlessly cataloging <br/>\nevery<br/>\nmajor character or event. But the details of the story are <br/>\ninsignificant -<br/>\nwhat is significant is the progression of ideas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nn &quot;We read for the sake of reading, to talk about our interpretations in<br/>\nclass as though we were in a book club. ... And this pattern, grade for <br/>\nthe<br/>\nsake of grade, work for the sake of work, can be found everywhere. <br/>\nLadies<br/>\nand gentlemen, the spirit of intellectual thought is lost. I speak <br/>\ntoday not<br/>\nto rant, complain or cause trouble. ... Rather, I was moved by the <br/>\ncountless<br/>\nhours wasted in those halls.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the principal&#39;s reaction? He said Elnahal&#39;s speech was <br/>\n&quot;hypocritical&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;an insult.&quot; Speaking of the other students in the audience, Blake <br/>\nsaid,<br/>\n&quot;My hope was they did not hear or understand what he was saying. ... He <br/>\nwas<br/>\nbelittling the diplomas of every one of those kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNonsense. Elnahal was making those kids, and everyone else, think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool officials should be asking themselves why they wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\napproved<br/>\nthis speech in the first place. Elnahal&#39;s fellow graduates and <br/>\nMainland&#39;s<br/>\nteachers and administrators shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed by him. They <br/>\nshould be<br/>\nproud of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>\nprocess is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>\nof what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>\nThey go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out AOL.com today.
