The 4yo who sits on the side of the pool<br/>\nscreaming and crying through the swimming lesson making it hard for the<br/>\nrest of the kids to hear�.the 8yo who scowls and refuses to participate in<br/>\npractice while the parent, throwing apologetic looks to the coach,<br/>\nwheedles, bribes, and threatens the child in front of everyone to have a<br/>\ngood attitude and play.  Most of the time these are activities that the<br/>\nparent decided would be fun for the child, not because the child initiated<br/>\nthe interest or expressed any desire to participate.  Then the money and<br/>\ntime invested are held up to the child as being more important to the<br/>\nparent than the child�s abilities or interests or feelings.  I have come to<br/>\nrealize, through my own errors, that forced participation teaches my<br/>\nchildren only two things:  resentment for the one forcing them, and a<br/>\nstrong dislike for the activity they are being forced to complete.==<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great perspective on quitting. I have often questioned how I would <br/>\nhandle my children quitting an activity before it&#39;s &quot;finished&quot;, but this <br/>\nreminded me of the horrible experiences I had growing up. My mother was <br/>\npainfully shy (and developed agoraphobia later on) so she forced me into <br/>\nmany activities just for the &quot;socialization&quot; she thought I was lacking. It <br/>\njust so happened I preferred playing alone most of the time or staying <br/>\nindoors doing other activities. I had friends I could join when I wanted to, <br/>\nbut I just chose not to be social most of the time. She was so afraid that I <br/>\nwould develop what she had that she thought she&#39;d force me to do the <br/>\nopposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result was me hating being forced into these social situations <br/>\nbecause I knew why I was there. I just stood there most of the time with my <br/>\nhands in my pockets refusing to make small talk. To this day, I hate small <br/>\ntalk and I don&#39;t know how to do it &quot;successfully&quot;. Even though I finished <br/>\nall the activities (girl scout summer camps, dance classes, various sports, <br/>\netc.), it didn&#39;t change how I felt about them and it didn&#39;t change how I <br/>\nfelt about being social. Well, maybe it made me hate socializing even more <br/>\nthan I already did - and I&#39;m not some hermit holed up in her house every day <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Method� of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N\">http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon�t just search.

It was certainly true that I <br/>\ntried a lot of different activities while growing up, from girl scouts to <br/>\ncross country running to the marching band, and I had a very impressive <br/>\nt-shirt collection by the time I graduated high school here in Virginia.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, it hasnt gotten much better.  I dropped out of college in the <br/>\nmiddle of my sophomore year.   I quit smoking.  I quit my job when I had <br/>\nchildren.  I pulled my kids out of preschool to homeschool them.  I even <br/>\njoined karate a few years ago when my older children did, only to drop out <br/>\nafter a few months because it was too hard to attend classes with a very <br/>\nactive 2 year old (still have the cool t-shirt though).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what about quitting?  Isnt that a bad thing?  Wont it make children <br/>\nlazy, self-centered, and unfocused?  I have heard the argument that <br/>\nchildren must be made to finish what they start, even if they dont want <br/>\nto.  I have heard that it builds character, and teaches them <br/>\nperseverance.  Have you ever watched a baby learning to walk?  No one had <br/>\nto teach that child perseverance.  He falls down a thousand times, hits his <br/>\nhead on the coffee table, and tumbles off the foyer landing into the family <br/>\nroom over and over, but keeps getting back up and trying again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeve all seen it before.  The 4yo who sits on the side of the pool <br/>\nscreaming and crying through the swimming lesson making it hard for the <br/>\nrest of the kids to hear.the 8yo who scowls and refuses to participate in <br/>\npractice while the parent, throwing apologetic looks to the coach, <br/>\nwheedles, bribes, and threatens the child in front of everyone to have a <br/>\ngood attitude and play.  Most of the time these are activities that the <br/>\nparent decided would be fun for the child, not because the child initiated <br/>\nthe interest or expressed any desire to participate.  Then the money and <br/>\ntime invested are held up to the child as being more important to the <br/>\nparent than the childs abilities or interests or feelings.  I have come to <br/>\nrealize, through my own errors, that forced participation teaches my <br/>\nchildren only two things:  resentment for the one forcing them, and a <br/>\nstrong dislike for the activity they are being forced to complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults quit things all the time.  We call it prioritizing.  We drop one <br/>\nactivity in order to focus on another.  We also don&#39;t eat foods we dont <br/>\nlike.   Quitting something that is unhealthy, or that takes up too much of <br/>\nour time, or that we arent very good at, can be a sign of maturity, of <br/>\nrecognizing personal limitations, of realizing that we dont enjoy the <br/>\nactivity as much as we thought we would.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest benefits of home schooling is that it allows our <br/>\nchildren to explore the entire world, to pick up activities and look at <br/>\nthem, and if they dont fit just right, put it down again and try <br/>\nanother.  Like a person trying to build a jigsaw puzzle, and trying a <br/>\nvariety of pieces until they find the ones that fit, it might take our <br/>\nchildren some time to find the activities that they enjoy and excel at.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My two oldest children have, in their few years, tried soccer, piano, art <br/>\nlessons, ballet, tennis, karate, various playgroups, swimming lessons, <br/>\ngames clubs, volleyball, basketball, co-op classes, and a couple youth <br/>\ngroups.  They have explored making movies, writing books and scripts, <br/>\nbuilding models, cooking and baking, computer games, woodworking, and <br/>\nrunning various businesses of their own design.  Many of their interests <br/>\nwax and wane almost as often as the moon does, and a few of them are as <br/>\nconstant as the stars.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it is a matter of timing.  That puzzle piece might fit <br/>\neventually, when we are farther along in the assembly of the jigsaw <br/>\npuzzle.   Leaving room for growth and maturity before returning to an <br/>\nactivity can be a good thing!   Most activities and interests can be put <br/>\naside for a while and picked back up again sometime in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter insisted she wanted to quit karate about 18 months ago.  We <br/>\nsuggested we just &quot;freeze&quot; her membership at the karate school for a while, <br/>\nand if she still wanted nothing to do with it in 6 months, we would <br/>\nformally close the membership there.  Wouldn&#39;t you know, she changed her <br/>\nmind again about 4 months later, and even got a trophy in the karate <br/>\ntournament that year.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe badly sprained her ankle a couple months later, and was out of karate <br/>\nagain for 4 months, and we froze the membership again.  When she felt her <br/>\nankle was strong enough, she returned, and has been thoroughly enjoying it, <br/>\nsometimes going 4 times a week when she can.  She came in first place in <br/>\nher age and belt division this year at the tournament.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had insisted that she continue because we had invested X amount of <br/>\nmoney, or continue until a holiday or other arbitrary mark on the calendar, <br/>\nshe would have resented every extra moment spent there, and never returned <br/>\nto it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:  Sarah begged for piano lessons when she was 7.  By the <br/>\ntime she was 8 and a half, she hated it so much.  The writing required in <br/>\nthe theory books was too much for her, and she didnt want to practice <br/>\nevery day, so we let her quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past summer my 11yo son wanted to take piano, and we found a piano <br/>\nteacher through sharenet that actually comes to our house, and is very <br/>\ninexpensive as far as piano lessons go, so I threw it on the table for <br/>\nSarah as well.  I suggested to her that since the teacher was already <br/>\ncoming to the house, and we could have two lessons back to back, why not <br/>\ngive it just till the end of the summer.  I left it totally up to <br/>\nher.  Guess what?  She has found that she loves it now.  I don&#39;t have to <br/>\ntell either of them to practice; in fact, I have to ask them to stop sometimes!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about quitting when others depend upon us?  Like in team sports or <br/>\ndrama productions?  How can we teach our children to fulfill obligations in <br/>\nthese instances?   If my child were truly an integral part of a team, or <br/>\nhad a lead part in a play, I would discuss the situation with him, and let <br/>\nhim know what was going to happen after he quit.  Perhaps together we could <br/>\nwork out a solution so that others arent let down, but my childs desire <br/>\nto move on is also respected.  Setting a date such as after the big game, <br/>\nor after the play production might be acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lets be honest, here.  Most kids who are good at sports and are key <br/>\nplayers on a team dont want to quit; it is the ones who are the bench <br/>\nwarmers, or who are awkward on the playing field and realize their time <br/>\ncould be better spent pursuing other interests are the ones that usually <br/>\nwant to quit.  We have all been told, and Disney movies have been made to <br/>\nprove, that no one person is the star on a team.  Dropping out shouldnt <br/>\ncause the team to lose the championship unless they were going to lose <br/>\nanyway.   Drama clubs usually have understudies preparing for the major <br/>\nroles in case of illness or accident, and minor roles are usually just <br/>\nadded in so that everyone gets a part and arent left out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeciding to allow our children the right to quit takes a lot of faith in <br/>\ntheir ability to choose for themselves what their interests are.  It means <br/>\nmaking up our minds not to hold any obligations on our part against them, <br/>\nsuch as money or time already invested.  If we have purchased expensive <br/>\nequipment, can we resell it and recoup some of our loss?  Can we get a <br/>\nrefund on the remaining classes?  If our child quits the team, will the <br/>\nteam really be without someone to take their position?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy challenge to you is to stop viewing quitting as a door closing and an <br/>\nopportunity lost.  Instead, it is a door opening and time being released to <br/>\nbe used to explore new interests and an opportunity for our children to <br/>\nexpand their knowledge and skills in other directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I quit marching band, but I remained in the orchestra and to this day <br/>\nlove playing my flute.   Yes I quit cross-country running, but I then <br/>\njoined the editing team of the school literary magazine.   Yes, I quit <br/>\ncollege, but I then graduated with honors from Katherine Gibbs Secretarial <br/>\nSchool and was making $20K a year before my classmates were even out of <br/>\ncollege, and I learned shorthand as well.   Yes, I quit sending my kids to <br/>\nschool, but discovered that education was so much more than what could be <br/>\ncontained in a concrete building and taught between 9-3 five days a week, <br/>\nten months a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat opportunities and adventures are awaiting your kids?  Why dont you <br/>\nquit and find out?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan M (VA)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html\">http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living.

Maybe let them finish out the school year and do some schooling this summer to get the feel for what they think and go from there. If they thrieve and love it and seem to have grown as a person then its something to consider   keeping them at home.  Good luck with the husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Burgess &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sueburgess@...\">sueburgess@...</a>&gt; wrote:  Hi, <br/>\nI am new to the group. I am not currently an unschooler, but I am working on it. I live in Alaska, have 3 kids, Cody ds 16, Kianne dd 11 and Holly dd 8. I am needing some help and advice on how to convince my husband that it&#39;s ok to begin homeschooling again. Without going into too much detail, I have homeschooled/unschooled in the past. My son was homeschooled, for the most part unschooled (we tried different things thru the years) until he started 6th grade and wanted to go to junior high. He was behind, quite a bit, went to Sylvan to &quot;catch up&quot; and has been in public school since. My 11 yr dd is now wanting to homeschool again. She also did a bit of it back in 1st and 2nd grade. And I believe my 8 yr old dd is dyslexic and I want her home also. She doesn&#39;t want to be, she enjoys being at school with her friends. My girls go to a Charter school, somewhat better than the regular public schools. The classes are multi-age, etc. <br/>\nMy husband doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; or agree with unschooling at all. He is saying right now to we need to make Kianne stick it out in school, she can&#39;t just quit. You can&#39;t quit things just because you don&#39;t like them. He went off on a rant saying &quot; I don&#39;t like having to work, but I do it, I don&#39;t just quit; I don&#39;t like paying the bills, but I can&#39;t just quit&quot; Good grief!! <br/>\nHe regrets letting Cody quit soccer and basketball when he was younger (no, he&#39;s not a huge sports guy) because he thinks he should have been made to stick to it. Cody now isn&#39;t involved in sports or anything much really except online computer games. He doesn&#39;t hang out with friends much, go to school social functions, etc. He plays computer and rides his 4-wheeler (with friends often) But he is definately not a social guy. So, my husband thinks if we had made him stick to things earlier, &quot;got him out there&quot;, he would be doing more now. <br/>\nSorry, I know I&#39;m getting off track! My mind is wandering and full of alot! My main concern right now is how to show my dh that it&#39;s ok for Kianne to want to change the way she learns. And to bring Holly home, at least part time, to ease her frustration with her struggles with dyslexia (possibly). My dh is a very intelligent guy and I need to find a way to present to him why this is ok. That I want our kids to make changes when they aren&#39;t happy, that I don&#39;t want them stuck in a job that makes them miserable just cuz they feel they have to do it. But he thinks they will just quit whenever the going gets rough. <br/>\nHelp! I hope I made some sense! <br/>\nThanks for listening if you made it through :-))<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Unschooling   Attachment parenting   John holt     Parenting magazine   Single parenting <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
