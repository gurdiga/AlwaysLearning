While I would not say my parents are stellar grandparents, I can certainly see that they are trying hard to understand our choices and have a loving relationship with us and our son.  In watching Doug and I with Ethan, they have witnessed what a loving parent-child relationship looks like--something, sadly, neither of them had in their own homes as children.  I think it has impacted them positively.  I mentioned before that my dad said &quot;I love you&quot; to me for the first time a few years ago.  I could tell it wasn&#39;t easy for him to say that to me.  It was a risk.  That was profoundly moving for me.  It healed a good chunk of the hurt I had been carrying around for so long.  My mom has also mentioned to me that she admires the mom I have become.  She, too, has said that she wishes she had the knowledge I have now when she was raising my brothers and myself.  Slowly, good memories, are crowding out the older ones.  I say good riddance.  Resentment is too heavy a burden to bear, at least for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve said this before, but try, if you can, not to focus on the negative in your relationship with your parents.  I don&#39;t mean pretend things didn&#39;t happen.  I don&#39;t mean pretend those things didn&#39;t hurt or didn&#39;t have an impact on you.  What I mean is, while acknowledging that difficulties do exist, try to look past them when you can, to actively find something that looks nicer, better, more useful as a point of focus for moving forward.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, you as a parent, are the greatest influence in your children&#39;s lives now.  The grandparents are not.  Use your influence to make your children&#39;s lives easier and more joyful than yours was.  Support and encourage their relationships with family and friends.  Be there for them when something or someone makes them happy, or when something or someone disappoints them.  Use what you&#39;ve learned along the way to help them navigate relationships better than you did.  That level of generosity is very healing in my experience.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Recovering from emotional abuse from my own parents -Book?","postDate":"1376921326","msgId":71997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzY5MjEzMjYuNjg2MDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTXVqbWRzPW9FdFV5d3NIVGVZdUVFaC01TmJvOGN3dmc1M29YRXI1YlBERXpQbk1MQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGt1bjdwbStqbDMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUVEODY1NDItRjdDRC00Q0EwLTg3RTEtRDBBRThDNkY4M0FFQGJpZ3BvbmQuY29tPiA8Q0FNdWptZHZMQlRTTjFISHc4T0JqdENKWXF5Yi14UzlreU13YkRpMU1xaEJVajJ0UWN3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FQelo9Vm1peXZZT1BQWnhZMTY2c3RVb0VZb25IUnRLeT01NWdMaW81SnZkQ2lDTkN3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MTM3Njg4MzQzMC42NTQxMC5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTgyMjAzLm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPENBTXVqbWRzPW9FdFV5d3NIVGVZdUVFaC01TmJvOGN3dmc1M29YRXI1YlBERXpQbk1MQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71991,"nextInTopic":72001,"prevInTime":71996,"nextInTime":71998,"topicId":71978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  ... financial reach of their children.
