I walked there and I explained to him that the farm had a huge manure pit ( like a huge open place where all the liquid manure is stored- extremely dangerous), lots of huge trucks and tractors coming in and out and that some people could have been drinking too much and asked him if he could stay in that huge barn that was safe. Two of the other kids said: &quot; what we cannot go out of the barn?&quot;<br/>\nAnd instantly walked out just to prove the point that he could. So I made a joke about it and talked to my son in Portuguese and he was OK with playing in the barn and being  safe.<br/>\nDo you think that kid got a lot of &quot;nos&quot;.<br/>\nA little later on my son had enough of the kids when they started playing all over the farm and he  did not fell totally safe and he hung out with me for the rest of the time he was there.<br/>\nIt was pretty caotic there  so not really a safe place for kids wandering in a very dark night <br/>\n(overcast so no moon).

It says nothing about wether or not he has a<br/>\ngood relationship with his kids.  That would be far more telling, if we<br/>\nknew the outcomes of his &quot;successful&quot; parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nA conversation came up at a 4th of July party that we attended, where a<br/>\ndad said that it&#39;s a fine line between being a parent and a friend.  I<br/>\nknow we&#39;ve had this convo before and I&#39;m hoping someone will remind me<br/>\nwho wrote that wonderful thing about being friends with your kids!  I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking it was Pam...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was telling Chamille about that conversation, and we were talking<br/>\nabout how so many parents don&#39;t think they should be friends with their<br/>\nkids.  Chamille said that she&#39;d feel hurt if I didn&#39;t want to be her<br/>\nfriend.  She does consider me a friend AND a parent.  She doesn&#39;t think<br/>\nthere should be any line.  She made a little revelation in that<br/>\nconversation... she said &quot;no wonder teenagers don&#39;t want to hang out<br/>\nwith their parents, they aren&#39;t friends and the parents don&#39;t think they<br/>\nshould be.&quot;  She thinks that teenagers like being friends with adults<br/>\nand parents and that the dismissal of friendship probably hurts and the<br/>\nonly way to counter that is to disrespect and dismiss in turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hung out with the kids more than the adults at that party, the teens<br/>\nand the younger ones both and sometimes together.  Part of my goal was<br/>\nto keep the little ones away from the teens a bit to give them some<br/>\nspace to do oddly weird things with fire and fireworks and not have to<br/>\nworry about keeping an eye on the little ones.  The teenagers were<br/>\nextremely grateful for that!  The other adults expected them to watch<br/>\nthe little ones, although didn&#39;t actually ask, it was mostly assumed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dad who had made that comment about being friends with kids, has a<br/>\npregnant 16 yr old daughter.  She&#39;s too far along to get an abortion,<br/>\nwould have liked to, but was too afraid to say anything to anyone.  So,<br/>\nby not being friends with his daughter, he gets to be a grandfather<br/>\nreally young.  I&#39;m fairly certain that the dad had said &quot;no&quot; to her<br/>\nhaving sex and getting pregnant.  Just because a parent says &quot;no&quot; doesnt<br/>\nmean diddly skwat, kids will do what they do, to pretend otherwise is<br/>\npretty silly.  I guess by saying &quot;no&quot; the parent can say they did their<br/>\njob by not allowing it, and shift the blame onto the kids, who clearly<br/>\ndisobeyed and did wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept my mouth shut... I&#39;m trying out this new way of being quiet and<br/>\nsweet instead of opinionated and alienating myself and Chamille.  That<br/>\nman is the boyfriend of one of Chamille&#39;s friend&#39;s mother.

When he was three or thereabouts, his  <br/>\nparents divorced and Mr. Bobo and his mom remained in Charleston until  <br/>\nshe remarried when he was seven. Her second husband, a medical school  <br/>\nprofessor, took them to the suburbs of Chicago. John and his  <br/>\nstepfather had their share of &quot;issues&quot; over the years, culminating in  <br/>\nJohn going to live with his dad in Valdosta, GA, when he was fifteen.  <br/>\nWhen he was seventeen and about to enter his senior year of high  <br/>\nschool, John&#39;s father announced that he was taking a job in Augusta,  <br/>\nGA. Rather than attend a third high school, John opted to return for  <br/>\nhis senior year to the high school he&#39;d attended as a freshman and  <br/>\nsophomore, Proviso West High School in Hillside, IL, where he  <br/>\ngraduated in 1965.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a summer spent experimenting with juvenile delinquency, -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my.  How transparent is this?  He wishes his parents had stayed  <br/>\ntogether so he advises parents to pay more attention to their  <br/>\nmarriages than to their parents.  His decisions were based on high  <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think he was told &quot;No&quot; by his father AND stepfather AND mother  <br/>\nbut somehow thinks more would&#39;ve been better?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-where John took his first job as a real, honest-to-goodness  <br/>\npsychologist, working in a program that served children with behavior  <br/>\nand learning problems. Two years later, in 1976, ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got his first real job in 1974, and he was born in 1947?  What a  <br/>\nslacker. &lt;bwg&gt;  (He was a musician before that; that&#39;s fine with me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he&#39;s working with problem children, not with NON-problem  <br/>\nchildren.  I wonder if he&#39;s ever even seen or known kids who had  <br/>\nvigorous mental health?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...is the father of two successful adults, and the grandfather of  <br/>\nseven children...make that seven well-behaved grandchildren.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope they&#39;re all happy.

Is this something that&#39;s findable  <br/>\nonline?   I looked vaguely but couldn&#39;t remember the guy&#39;s name.  I  <br/>\ndid find this, on a Q&A site that exists mostly to make money, but the  <br/>\nend was so.... NORMAL in the regular world and so different in mine  <br/>\nthat I was surprised at how far I&#39;ve come!<br/>\n<br/>\nCool!<br/>\n<br/>\nI left out the details of the first four situations where no is  <br/>\ndesirable and expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================<br/>\nBeing a parent isn&#39;t always easy, and often, it&#39;s not fun. Some of the  <br/>\nhardest times are when we have to deny our children their requests or  <br/>\nput a stop to certain behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen are the most important times to tell a child &quot;no&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. For safety reasons....<br/>\n2. For health reasons...<br/>\n<br/>\n3. For character reasons...<br/>\n<br/>\n4. For convenience reasons...<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Just because. It remains the parents&#39; prerogative to deny a child&#39;s  <br/>\nrequest just because &quot;I say so.&quot; This doesn&#39;t mean a parent has the  <br/>\nright to taunt or tease a son or daughter, but rather, that some  <br/>\nrequests may be denied or some behaviors prevented or punished because  <br/>\na parent may know what is best without needing to explain to the  <br/>\nchild. Children should learn to respect authority from their earliest  <br/>\nyears. When they are allowed to argue, wheedle, complain, or throw  <br/>\ntantrums that eventually earn them the privilege of getting what they  <br/>\nwant instead of respecting parents&#39; wishes, the balance of authority  <br/>\nis thwarted. Children learn to disrespect and disregard other forms of  <br/>\nauthority, such as teachers, law officials, and bosses, to get what  <br/>\nthey want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying &quot;no&quot; gets easier with practice. While parents can and should  <br/>\ngrant kids&#39; wishes when they can, it is expected and desirable to deny  <br/>\nthem for reasons like those cited above.<br/>\n==================================================================<br/>\nNot important, but for the record:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.essortment.com/family/tellchildno_sznl.htm\">http://www.essortment.com/family/tellchildno_sznl.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47759,"nextTopicId":47822}}
