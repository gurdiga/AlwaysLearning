I got him an easy reader, level one and he can read it with very little <br/>\nhelp. (Gets stuck on the word &quot;everyone&quot; every time!) I know that he has a <br/>\ngreat memory and and is getting some clues from the pictures in the book so <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how much he&#39;s actually reading. He loves to ask me how to spell <br/>\ndifferent words and then he types them on the computer. I would sound the <br/>\nword out slowly and he was correctly guessing the letters that made up the <br/>\nword. He adores books and is constantly wanting to be read to...possibly he&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to learn so he doesn&#39;t have to rely on someone to read to him.  I <br/>\nguess I&#39;m looking for any ideas to help him along or any feedback on his <br/>\nprogress.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Kagey in NW Ohio<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=85215&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=85215&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\nUsborne Books&lt;/A&gt;  <br/>\nmake great Christmas gifts!<br/>\n(www.ubah.com/z0939)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41,"nextTopicId":37}}
