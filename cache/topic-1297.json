She always talked about<br/>\nit like I would know exactly what she meant, like she would talk about<br/>\nthe park we went to last week or something.

The dad and the<br/>\nbaby died in the fire... I didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it either,<br/>\nand she doesn&#39;t remember it now (she&#39;s almost 9). I remember posting it<br/>\nto misc.kids at the time, and getting some really odd feedback :-O<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a half hour after my mom died on the morning of the11th, Cacie<br/>\napparently &quot;saw&quot; her sitting on the couch with the rest of us - we were<br/>\nall together, her, me, my dad, my sister (who we called on her cell phone<br/>\nto tell her and she said &quot;I&#39;m right here in front of your house, I just<br/>\ncame over&quot;), and my brother, just talking and crying, and Cacie saw her<br/>\ngrandma sitting right where she always sat on the corner of the couch.<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t mention it at the time, but the next day or the day after, she<br/>\nturned to me in the car and said something like, &quot;Mom, I think I&#39;m having<br/>\nsome hallucinations.&quot; and then described it. I told her that that was<br/>\nreally a good kind of hallucination to have, since she said it made her<br/>\nfeel better.... that sometimes people who have died recently stop by to<br/>\nvisit.  I think she was worried that she was becoming mentally ill. We<br/>\ntold my sister about it and she said it made her feel much better ..<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know if I believe that this stuff comes from something<br/>\nexternal, or something internal... I&#39;m not sure it matters, really.<br/>\nAlthough if she ever wants to do a past-life regression I think it would<br/>\nbe interesting. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s quite high on the scale of natural<br/>\ndissociative abilities - at 3 and 4, she used to while away long car<br/>\ntrips by watching movies with her eyes closed, she could just shut her<br/>\neyes and replay them.

I know the Hail, Mary is often thought of as a prayer.<br/>\n&gt; But what does hail mean...isn&#39;t  it merely a greeting.  Catholics do believe<br/>\n&gt; in having a special &#39;devotion&#39; to Mary,  but prayer and &#39;adoration&#39; are for<br/>\n&gt; God alone.<br/>\n&gt;     Other faiths that believe in eternal life speak with those passed on,<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t they.

Mary!&quot;?<br/>\nOn the other hand...many, many, MANY Catholics, particularly women, DO <br/>\nworship Mary. My grandparents were Portuguese, and my grandmother always had <br/>\nrepresentations of Mary all over the house, including a huge statue under a <br/>\nglass dome on her dresser. (When she died, no one wanted it. Now I wish I had <br/>\ntaken it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my family went to Portugal a couple of summers ago, one of the places we <br/>\nwent was Fatima.  Do you folks know that story? Three shepherd children were <br/>\nin a field and had a vision of Mary who spoke to them in 1917. She appeared <br/>\non six  occasions, and she made several predictions, mostly about the war. On <br/>\nher last appearance 70,000 watched, as she had predicted performing a <br/>\nmiracle. While only the children saw Mary, everyone watched as the sun seemed <br/>\nto dance in the sky, then fall to the ground, then return to normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the predictions was that two of the children would die young, and they <br/>\ndid. Those two were recently beatified (a first step toward sainthood) by the <br/>\npope. The last, Lucia, is still alive and a nun. (I guess you would almost <br/>\nhave to be.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to Fatima, even as an ex-Catholic, was very powerful. It didn&#39;t matter <br/>\nthat &gt;I&lt; didn&#39;t necessarily believe, because we were surrounded by people who <br/>\ndid, passionately.
