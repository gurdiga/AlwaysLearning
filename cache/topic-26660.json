It changes your relationship with parents and<br/>\ngrandparents. If they&#39;ve been meddlesome or controlling, it gives you<br/>\na HUGELY different space that forces them to back off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps in a million ways. I can&#39;t advocate moving away enough...only<br/>\nfor those that are needing to heal past issues or force a change in<br/>\nthe relationship of course. If you have a healthy, close relationship,<br/>\nthen that&#39;s a different story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI turned a very tumultuous relationship with my mother into a very<br/>\nclose and loving relationship (we both did) and space between us at<br/>\nthe beginning was very useful. I never had a dysfunctional or<br/>\ncodependent relationship with her, yet the distance was still useful<br/>\nin healing childhood crap.

To hear my little girl say those things about herself <br/>\njust<br/>\nbroke my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan&#39;s done this several times---HUGE meltdowns where he really seems <br/>\nsuicidal. To the point where I&#39;ve called my dad the psychiatrist to <br/>\nfind out what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time, Daddy talked to him for three minutes and all&#39;s well. &lt;g&gt; At <br/>\nleast I knew then it wasn&#39;t a dangerous situation. Ugly and horrible <br/>\nand serious, but not dangerous. I guess my dad knows what to say! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we keep &quot;Rescue Remedy&quot; handy. We&#39;ll both take a few drops. I try <br/>\nto get him to take a few deep breaths with me. Sometimes, he&#39;s so wound <br/>\nup, he won&#39;t. I think sometimes he&#39;s just *needing* to be able to <br/>\nmeltdown like this---he NEEDS to be able to cry and vent. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nhe *wants* to, but I think there&#39;s something hiding that he needs to <br/>\nget OUT.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a brother who is eight years older and into so many things. I&#39;m <br/>\nsure that seems overwhelming when you&#39;re only eight or nine or ten. Mom <br/>\n& Dad and big brother have *things* to do. We&#39;re all better at drawing <br/>\nthan he is (well, except Ben&lt;g&gt;)---and he wants to be a Manga artist. <br/>\nSo it&#39;s frustrating. I think some days he just has a BUNCH of <br/>\nfrustration build up over time, and he just needs to let it all out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s usually HORRIBLE, but after the 30-40 minutes of hell, he bounces <br/>\nback and is fine! While it&#39;s happening (and especially the first time), <br/>\nI&#39;m ready to hospitalize him! We&#39;ve had 5-6 of them over 2-3 years. I <br/>\nknow what to do *now*! &lt;g&gt; Rescue Remedy, hugs, listening, validating, <br/>\nbrainstorming. Soft music and those slice & bake chocolate chip cookies <br/>\ndon&#39;t hurt! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, he&#39;s just as bright and fun as usual. No one would know how <br/>\nterrifying the whole ordeal was---or that it even took place! And it&#39;s <br/>\noften shortly followed by a growth spurt or increased ability in <br/>\nwhatever&#39;s been the issue (drawing or diving or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTDT. And I may have another 2-3 in my future! &lt;G&gt; I take them very <br/>\nseriously when they&#39;re happening, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re just a <br/>\nreaction to frustration and not a permanent condition.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a small world...but a BIG life!&quot;   ~Aaron McGlohn. aged 6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out AOL.com today.

She has seemed a lot happier. I can spend a lot of time talking to my<br/>\nson about baseball history, but I also make sure I&#39;m initiating<br/>\nconversations with my daughter about Hannah Montana or clothes or music.<br/>\nI&#39;ll dig up one of my CDs that has music that I think she might like or go<br/>\nwindow-shopping and bargain-hunting with her. (Last week, we found a pair of<br/>\nConverse All-Star high-tops for $4.95 -- they were lime green with large<br/>\npolka dots and perfect for her.)
