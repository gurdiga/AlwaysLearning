We are currently living in Asheville, NC in an area that has a few unschool families and quite a few homeschools (lots of religious ones). We are a bit of a drive from town and although I try to get there as much as possible for playgrounds and playdates sometimes it hard. Plus  many of the parents we meet are not on the same page with how we respond to our<br/>\n&gt; dd. (for instance one little girl that DD really likes has nice parents but they do things like when she falls down and cries they simply tell her to pick herself up which doesn&#39;t fit with how we parent :()<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We recently went through a huge shift in our mindset regarding our plan to unschool. We had already pretty much been there but occasionally I would feel bad that I wasn&#39;t &quot;doing&quot; enough things at home with our three and half year old and would go through this thinking that maybe some classes or a couple of days at a free school with me there to watch out for her would be helpful. Well recently I heard about someone making a free range kids school and thought it<br/>\n&gt; sounded good. I went and met with the woman who was putting it together and her kids and it felt interesting because dd would have free access to some things that we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; and the chance to play with other kids and I&#39;d be there with her watching out over her and making sure she was okay and also if she wanted to nurse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I decided to take DH to the open house which turned out to be more planning than anything else and I&#39;m so glad I did because it turned out to be a wonderful opportunity for us to cement what really felt right to us. After watching DD play with other kids and realizing that there was so much happening that was unsupervised among young influential kids, and realizing that there were issues that we brought up that were just brushed off we realized that maybe we really don&#39;t need to be involved in something like that after all. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also spoke to a friend who has her daughter in a small coop of five children but they have a teacher and although they have free play they call it a school which just already feels too schoolish to us. At<br/>\n&gt; this same time period we had gone to a May Faire that was full of Waldorf schools and preschools and that just finally clicked that it DID NOT resonate with us AT ALL! I guess we&#39;re getting more secure in our choices which I suppose is part of what happens as time passes and we get exposed to things that allow us to feel right about our choices. We also realized that &quot;nature based&quot; activities which were what we liked about Waldorf are already everywhere! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DH also reminded me that getting DD to DO things often consisted of me doing the things I thought we should and he was right LOL. I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s about deschooling my brain, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more about feeling like no one ever did fun creative artsy things with me as a kid and I don&#39;t want the same thing to happen now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So really I&#39;m looking for ideas, resources, reading, blogs etc that would focus more on kids from 3-5 who would typically be in preschool.

An example is that we did a thing at the May Faire with flowers and ink printing. I was thinking it would be fun to do at home until DH commented that I was the one who was doing them and not really her. So my should was more about feeling like I should find things for her to do that she might like. I feel like if I don&#39;t push myself a bit then we&#39;ll just spend our days reading, watching TV, and playdates rather than me thinking outside of the box for some other things I might not normally think to offer. Hence one of the reasons I asked for ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might add that DD is fabulous at puzzles and loves to do them over an over repeatedly so I&#39;m always looking for new puzzles and we create all kinds of games around them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should have simply asked for ideas of what people do/have done in daily life with their younger kids.

We are currently living in Asheville, NC in an area that has a few unschool families and quite a few homeschools (lots of religious ones). We are a bit of a drive from town and although I try to get there as much as possible for playgrounds and playdates sometimes it hard. Plus  many of the parents we meet are not on the same page with how we respond to our<br/>\ndd. (for instance one little girl that DD really likes has nice parents but they do things like when she falls down and cries they simply tell her to pick herself up which doesn&#39;t fit with how we parent :()<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently went through a huge shift in our mindset regarding our plan to unschool. We had already pretty much been there but occasionally I would feel bad that I wasn&#39;t &quot;doing&quot; enough things at home with our three and half year old and would go through this thinking that maybe some classes or a couple of days at a free school with me there to watch out for her would be helpful. Well recently I heard about someone making a free range kids school and thought it<br/>\nsounded good. I went and met with the woman who was putting it together and her kids and it felt interesting because dd would have free access to some things that we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; and the chance to play with other kids and I&#39;d be there with her watching out over her and making sure she was okay and also if she wanted to nurse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I decided to take DH to the open house which turned out to be more planning than anything else and I&#39;m so glad I did because it turned out to be a wonderful opportunity for us to cement what really felt right to us. After watching DD play with other kids and realizing that there was so much happening that was unsupervised among young influential kids, and realizing that there were issues that we brought up that were just brushed off we realized that maybe we really don&#39;t need to be involved in something like that after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also spoke to a friend who has her daughter in a small coop of five children but they have a teacher and although they have free play they call it a school which just already feels too schoolish to us. At<br/>\nthis same time period we had gone to a May Faire that was full of Waldorf schools and preschools and that just finally clicked that it DID NOT resonate with us AT ALL! I guess we&#39;re getting more secure in our choices which I suppose is part of what happens as time passes and we get exposed to things that allow us to feel right about our choices. We also realized that &quot;nature based&quot; activities which were what we liked about Waldorf are already everywhere! <br/>\n<br/>\nDH also reminded me that getting DD to DO things often consisted of me doing the things I thought we should and he was right LOL. I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s about deschooling my brain, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more about feeling like no one ever did fun creative artsy things with me as a kid and I don&#39;t want the same thing to happen now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo really I&#39;m looking for ideas, resources, reading, blogs etc that would focus more on kids from 3-5 who would typically be in preschool. I have a lot of reading resources but so many are focused around older kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow!
