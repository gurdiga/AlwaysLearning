I went to  <br/>\ncollege and spent thousands of dollars in a major I hated, and wasted  <br/>\na year of my life trying to prove something and get my mom to approve  <br/>\nof me. I faced disappointment from all camps when I dropped my premed  <br/>\nand went to regular zoology. What I want to know is, How in the hell  <br/>\ndoes your MIL equate intelligence to disability? That is not good for  <br/>\nyour children to be around, esp your own who has quad! I would  <br/>\ndefinitely not allow a poisonous influence like that in my home or  <br/>\naround my kids!

He did great! He had awesome grades, and he tested well,  <br/>\nand the teachers loved him. But he had gotten to the point where  <br/>\nperformance was all that counted, and he only lived to please.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s no living in that. When he first came home he cried all the  <br/>\ntime, he needed someone to tell him all the time that he was the best  <br/>\nat everything. That&#39;s all that exists in the schools, and you can&#39;t  <br/>\nget around that. If you can&#39;t be the best at grades, then it becomes  <br/>\nsports, or clubs, or ingratiating yourself to the teachers.

I have my own not-always-good  <br/>\nhistory with being &quot;precocious&quot; and I was surrounded at that time by  <br/>\nfriends who reported on their babies like this: &quot;Nate has started  <br/>\nwalking. He&#39;s only nine months, so that&#39;s very advanced.&quot; Not just  <br/>\ntelling what the baby did, but reporting always on how that stacks up  <br/>\nto what other babies do, with a definite emphasis on early being better.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Its amazing how competative this is. I used to point out that whena  child is 18 no-one is gonna give two cents what age they walked!<br/>\n  My kids all walked at different ages ranging from 6 months for the eldest to never for the youngest. I love them all the same!<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought it was good for me that I got early practice at being  <br/>\ncheerful and mellow in the face of people suggesting there was  <br/>\nsomething wrong with Eric (even though the age at which he walked was  <br/>\ncompletely within the normal developmental range, not delayed at  <br/>\nall),  pressing me to get him checked out, or blaming his character  <br/>\n(&quot;He&#39;s just lazy.&quot;). It was also good practice seeing my kid through  <br/>\nmy own eyes, because it was so clear he was busy with other things  <br/>\nand developing in all kinds of ways--including improving gross motor  <br/>\nskills, just not through walking. Watching Eric play and work, it was  <br/>\nclear that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him. It only ever  <br/>\nseemed like there might be when people were comparing him to their  <br/>\nown (superior) babies, or trying to hold him up to some expectation  <br/>\nthey&#39;d developed of what babies &quot;should&quot; be doing at any given time.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing I would hope is that one day &#39;soemthing wrong&#39; becomes not such a big deal. Maybe this would eliminate the competition when cerebral aplsy is seen as just another facet and not the end of the world1!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also add to what Julie said that there is potential trouble when  <br/>\na kid is on the &quot;early&quot; end and parents--or the child--get too  <br/>\ninvested not only in what the child is doing and how the child is  <br/>\ndeveloping and learning, but the fact that the child is early. I have  <br/>\na lot of friends who are college professors and they value intellect,  <br/>\nthey tended to be &quot;gifted&quot; themselves as children, and they expect  <br/>\ntheir kids to be, too. It makes me nervous when I hear them talking  <br/>\nabout their kids--in the kids&#39; hearing--saying not just, &quot;It&#39;s so  <br/>\nexciting that Jaden has learned to read!&quot; but &quot;Jaden has learned to  <br/>\nread, and he&#39;s only four!&quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We had this from the in-laws. They are both pushy academics and only value kids for doing something &#39;early&#39; or &#39;better&#39; (as long as its intellectual) They were like it all through my eldest three&#39;s babyhood.

They need to get over it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my own experience, getting praise for doing things early can  <br/>\nlead to a kid pushing herself to remain &quot;ahead,&quot; which gets harder  <br/>\nand harder as you get older. Or it can lead to problems transitioning  <br/>\nto adulthood. It&#39;s weird to look back on it now at the age of 40, but  <br/>\nit was very hard for me in my mid-twenties when I realized I was too  <br/>\nold to be &quot;precocious&quot; anymore, that no matter what I accomplished, I  <br/>\nwould never again be the youngest person ever to do it. Because being  <br/>\nprecocious had been treated like a big deal, by parents, teachers,  <br/>\nand relatives, it was hard for me to let go of that quality being  <br/>\nsomething that gave me value.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  GHow did it make you feel&gt; I ask cos my eldest has gone back to school and MIL is always going on about how her marks are the best.

And this is damaging to a  <br/>\nchild whether he is the better one or the deficient one. And it is  <br/>\ndamaging to our relationships with our kids if we&#39;re thinking in  <br/>\nthese terms even in subtle ways. Or so it seems to me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Its a very insidious thing. I was watching some adverts the other day aimed at mothers for those electronic book things. onthe advert mum and dad were thrilled when beautiful blond blue eyed (another message there) toddler pressed the buttons and repeated the words but unhappy when the child didn&#39;t. It was promoting such early academic stuff I was astonished. the next advert was for a car with the message that women wont find you sexy unless you achieve anough in life to own the car. the car buyer was suave and handsome, the guy on the bike the women ignored was geeky with mad hair.<br/>\n  Its a real battle changing this. H already thinks that what you look like and what you are is more important than who you are inside :-(<br/>\n  S  <br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Any <br/>\nspecies, as a whole, that has a short infancy or juvenile period usually <br/>\nlives in a lousy environment where infants or juveniles are most likely <br/>\nto be eaten before reaching adulthood. So, things like dragonflies, <br/>\nwhich have a really long juvenile period, have a low predation or <br/>\nmortality risk when they are young, but are really quick to be devoured <br/>\nonce they molt into dragonflies. I always keep that in mind when <br/>\nthinking about my own children&#39;s precociousness, or lack thereof. I <br/>\nfigure that the longer they are little, the better their environment is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252551372,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;supenn@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:making comparisons (was re: introduction Jenniffer in Harpers Ferry)","postDate":"1145632777","msgId":25369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwMjU1QzRDLUU5RkEtNEU0Ny1CNkYxLTU2OUIwNDM3REE1MEBkaWVyYXVlci5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDIxMTQyMDEzLjExNTE5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDIxMTQyMDEzLjExNTE5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25368,"nextInTopic":25370,"prevInTime":25368,"nextInTime":25370,"topicId":25367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have  <br/>\na lot of friends who are college professors and they value intellect,  <br/>\nthey tended to be &quot;gifted&quot; themselves as children, and they expect  <br/>\ntheir kids to be, too. It makes me nervous when I hear them talking  <br/>\nabout their kids--in the kids&#39; hearing--saying not just, &quot;It&#39;s so  <br/>\nexciting that Jaden has learned to read!&quot; but &quot;Jaden has learned to  <br/>\nread, and he&#39;s only four!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n From my own experience, getting praise for doing things early can  <br/>\nlead to a kid pushing herself to remain &quot;ahead,&quot; which gets harder  <br/>\nand harder as you get older. Or it can lead to problems transitioning  <br/>\nto adulthood. It&#39;s weird to look back on it now at the age of 40, but  <br/>\nit was very hard for me in my mid-twenties when I realized I was too  <br/>\nold to be &quot;precocious&quot; anymore, that no matter what I accomplished, I  <br/>\nwould never again be the youngest person ever to do it. Because being  <br/>\nprecocious had been treated like a big deal, by parents, teachers,  <br/>\nand relatives, it was hard for me to let go of that quality being  <br/>\nsomething that gave me value.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 21, I was in a Ph.D. program and on-track to complete my  <br/>\ndegree at 24 or 25. The program was wrong for me; I was struggling in  <br/>\nit; the department was terribly dysfunctional. It was clear I needed  <br/>\nto get out of there. My youth was made much of in my department by  <br/>\nfaculty and other students, and one reason it took me a year longer  <br/>\nthan it should have to leave the program was the knowledge that even  <br/>\nif I went back later and finished a Ph.D., I wouldn&#39;t be an  <br/>\nespecially young person with a Ph.D.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who is wonderfully healthy about this, and she is  <br/>\nalso a gift to me. She has a son, a year older than Eric, who was one  <br/>\nof your monkey-type toddlers, swarming up anything that wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nperfectly smooth, leaping into the air, turning somersaults. Eric  <br/>\ncontinues to be less physically daring than many kids his age (5). It  <br/>\nwas only recently, for instance, that he tried out jumping off the  <br/>\nbottom step with both feet and without holding onto anything. My  <br/>\nfriend was with us when it happened, and she entered so whole- <br/>\nheartedly into his own excitement and sense of accomplishment--I  <br/>\ncould tell that it never crossed her mind to think, &quot;Big deal, Noah  <br/>\nhas been doing that since he was 14 months old.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe underlying issue, I think, is how damaging it can be to compare  <br/>\nchildren, to decide that one child is doing &quot;better&quot; and that the  <br/>\nother child is therefore somehow deficient. And this is damaging to a  <br/>\nchild whether he is the better one or the deficient one. And it is  <br/>\ndamaging to our relationships with our kids if we&#39;re thinking in  <br/>\nthese terms even in subtle ways. Or so it seems to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:making comparisons (was re: introduction Jenniffer in Harpers Ferry)","postDate":"1145629590","msgId":25368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNzFBMzU1LTE1NjctNDNENy04QkRELTZEMDNEMDdCOEQ5NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDIxMTQyMDEzLjExNTE5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDIxMTQyMDEzLjExNTE5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25367,"nextInTopic":25369,"prevInTime":25367,"nextInTime":25369,"topicId":25367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
