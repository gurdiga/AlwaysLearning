Thank you, mostly for not being too frustrated with my &quot;baby-ness&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving read through more of the responses and thought more about it, I&#39;ve reached several conclusions:<br/>\n<br/>\n-As natural as unschooling is, especially for a non-institutionalized child such as my son, it is so counter-cultural for me, that I&#39;m still realizing I have a lot of deschooling to do.<br/>\n-I am realizing that I have a bit of a control issue (as in I want to be in control) and my fear of allowing him to watch what he wants when he wants, makes me feel like I&#39;m not in &quot;control of my household&quot; so to speak.  <br/>\n-I&#39;m going to have to learn to look at things from more of a &quot;we/us&quot; perspective and less of a &quot;us (parents) vs. him (child)&quot; perspective, which goes back to the deschooling bit.  <br/>\n-I&#39;m learning to be more and more leery of studies, especially since they will tell me nothing about my own child - only he can.  I&#39;m a little ashamed I didn&#39;t already know this, being attachment parenting oriented.  It&#39;s a large learning curve for me, I suppose.<br/>\n-Until pointed out, I never thought of the idea that watching TV would expose Seth to more diversity than books.  And, just because I love books, doesn&#39;t mean that he does.  After all, he can&#39;t read.  And, now more than when I was growing up, there are a lot of shows!  My husband, who grew up with cable, has a lot of amazing knowledge which he learned from watching the Discovery and Science channels...I was amazed, since I was taught that smart people were only so because they read and didn&#39;t watch TV.  Go figure.<br/>\n-I need to find things that I&#39;ll enjoy watching with Seth and he with me.  I&#39;m not going to worry about age appropriateness/censoring, since I don&#39;t believe in that sort of thing anyways.  Just the other day we discovered, on Netflix the Pink Panther Cartoon Collection, which is fun for both of us!  And, last weekend, my husband put on Space Balls, which we all enjoyed.  <br/>\n-I&#39;ve decided to be glad that he plays and watches, because it&#39;s true, I wouldn&#39;t want him slack-jawed and motionless.  So, I&#39;m going to turn that annoyance into a blessing.  Besides, how much different is it that I knit and watch?<br/>\n-And, finally, whenever I start feeling like he&#39;s watching &quot;too much&quot; I&#39;ll just remind myself how I&#39;d feel if someone restricted my reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last few days, my husband and I have been in what might be called &quot;negotiation talks&quot; regarding a television.  Right not it&#39;s not so much whether we should get one, but rather, what kind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":311341422,"authorName":"Dina","from":"&quot;Dina&quot; &lt;dapsign@...&gt;","profile":"dapsign","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Questions about TV","postDate":"1236141553","msgId":42940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvbDBsaCtpbDY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyRjg5Q0FBLTM1MDUtNDA1OS1BREE0LTZERTgxNTMzRjU5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42935,"nextInTopic":43002,"prevInTime":42939,"nextInTime":42941,"topicId":42854,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... me too!  i don t get that AT ALL.  why homeschool and intentionally keep information from your kids?  *i* learn from tv all the time.  just this week i","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2002029522\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I wanted mine to meet LOTS of people who knew things I didn&#39;t know.

It was a black and white,<br/>\nwhen everyone around us had color TV&#39;s.  Even when we did have TV, we<br/>\nwere only allowed to watch every once in a while.  My sister and I would<br/>\ngo through the TV guide to pick out our shows, because we had to agree,<br/>\nand then we would watch only those ones and it couldn&#39;t amount to more<br/>\nthan one hour a day and it couldn&#39;t interfere with dinner time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember feeling really anxious if we were out and about, or eating<br/>\nout at a restaurant, wondering if we&#39;d get home in time to watch the<br/>\nwhole show that we&#39;d picked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scarcity of it, made it extremely valuable, something to work one&#39;s<br/>\nschedule around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I watched a lot of things I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to while babysitting (I<br/>\n&gt; loved babysitting for people who had a TV!).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I watched Poltergeist at a friend&#39;s house without my parents knowing.  I<br/>\nwas about 11.  My parents would&#39;ve been VERY mad about it.  So, I<br/>\nwatched a scary movie, with absolutely no clue about scary movies or<br/>\nthat anything could give me nightmares.  I was completely niave about<br/>\nthe whole thing, and on top of that, I had no parents to talk to about<br/>\nit.  That had a lasting impression on me!

I didn&#39;t own a TV as a young adult<br/>\nuntil I met my husband and lived with him.  I was a little resistant to<br/>\nhaving a TV, and I had to deal with a lot of TV issues when we had our<br/>\nfirst child.  Ultimately, it seemed healthier to have a TV and not make<br/>\na big fuss over it.  I could view owning a TV within the same context as<br/>\nhaving a radio or tape deck, which is what we had then, something to use<br/>\nand enjoy when I wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, where am I going with this? Well, a little less than a year ago,<br/>\n&gt; we decided to get rid of our TV and DVD player. I found that not only<br/>\n&gt; was I &quot;addicted&quot; to it (I realized how bad it was when I shushed my<br/>\n&gt; husband during a show, and the thought occurred to me that I was doing<br/>\n&gt; what my parents in HS when we had a TV did that really hurt me),<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is a natural reaction to a controlled substance.  I had to<br/>\ndeal with similar issues.  It took years to do it, but I was finally<br/>\nable to have a TV on in the same room as me, and NOT watch it or pay<br/>\nattention to it.  It&#39;s a big deal!  Now I can multi-task with the TV on<br/>\nand keep up with the story and do other things.  Which you&#39;ve already<br/>\nnoticed that your child can do!  It&#39;s amazing what control will do to<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s natural abilities!<br/>\n<br/>\nand I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was using it as a babysitter for Seth.

That<br/>\ntitle alone says a lot.  TV viewed as a drug, or controlled substance<br/>\nthat is harmful.  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that control itself is<br/>\noften more harmful than the thing being controlled, and in the absence<br/>\nof control, the thing has less draw, less power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right now, my biggest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; struggle is the fact that it seems like all Seth wants to do is &quot;watch<br/>\n&gt; a movie&quot;.

Most people are worried if their kids seem to be <br/>\ntoo attentive and not doing other play at the same time. They use words like <br/>\n&quot;drones&quot;, &quot;zombies&quot;, &quot;locked in&quot;. They talk about &quot;addiction&quot; instead of <br/>\n&quot;passion&quot;, &quot;interested&quot;, &quot;fascinated&quot;, &quot;absorbed&quot;, &quot;excited&quot; or even <br/>\n&quot;relaxing&quot; and &quot;entertained&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is that Jayn, now 9, has always been perfectly able to absorb <br/>\nand be interested in her shows or movies while drawing, playing with dolls, <br/>\nplaying computer games, playing cards, doing puzzles, sewing, crafting, <br/>\neating, wrestling with daddy, or making up stories. She also sometimes wants <br/>\nthe tv off, usually when we are doing a doll scenario together. Sometimes we <br/>\nwill have the sound off with the picture going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use foam earplugs when I&#39;m feeling sensitive and want to lessen the impact <br/>\nof noises around me if I am using my computer, or when sleeping. The foam <br/>\nearplugs muffle noise without being totally soundproofing. They can make the <br/>\ndifference between being constantly distracted and irritated, and being <br/>\ncomfortable while freeing Jayn for her watching and play. I still hear her <br/>\nif she calls me from across the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea here is that it&#39;s up to me to attend to my own comfort rather than <br/>\nhave unreasonable expectations from those around me that would cause them <br/>\nemotional hardship. Asking a 3 year old not to play at the same time as <br/>\nwatching his tv shows seems an unreasonable expectation. If he were running <br/>\nin circles and screaming at the top of his lungs...well that might mean time <br/>\nto go to the park for a big run and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to get a tv, perhaps a portable dvd player. I would <br/>\nrecommend getting him his own laptop computer pretty soon. It sure made my <br/>\nlife easier when we got Jayn her own for internet surfing and computer <br/>\ngaming. She is now on to her second one. It amazes me to think that as <br/>\nrecently as 12 or 13 years ago they cost several thousand dollars, and were <br/>\nthicker, heavier and slower than even the cheapest versions are today.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can safely ignore all those studies, which are done on schooled kids, <br/>\nand frankly are often goofy if you read how they set up their research <br/>\nsituations. Watch your son instead. Talk to him about what he is seeing with <br/>\nthe same sense of positive interest that you would if he was showing you the <br/>\nflower he just found in the garden. I mean don&#39;t be looking for <br/>\nopportunities to criticize or teach something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I liked Caillou more. I find it very schooly, lots of &quot;going to <br/>\nschool soon&quot; propaganda. But that&#39;s just me. Your son might love him. Lots <br/>\nof great shows for very littles on Disney in the morning. Also Jayn loved <br/>\nBob the Builder and Max & Ruby (sigh). She used to like Wiggles, but can&#39;t <br/>\nabide them now. Now her favorite shows are Family Guy, American Dad, Ghost <br/>\nWhisperer, various cooking shows, How Clean is Your House, and a few shows <br/>\non Disney. (Jury still out on the new sitcom, Sonny With A Chance).<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

From the time I was 7 until I was 16,<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t have a TV and only borrowed one for the Olympics.  At first,<br/>\nthe reason we didn&#39;t have one was because our original one broke and<br/>\nwe were so poor we couldn&#39;t even afford to get it fixed (out of work<br/>\npastor with 8 children, I&#39;m surprised we even had clothes!).  I<br/>\nsuppose my parents just decided it was better not to have (perhaps<br/>\nbecause we were the pastor&#39;s family and needed to set an example, or<br/>\nperhaps because we went to a Mennonite school, I&#39;ll never know) and<br/>\nfor some reason I developed a stigma attached to TV.  Later in HS, my<br/>\nparents were very restrictive of what we could watch - if my younger<br/>\nsiblings couldn&#39;t watch it, than neither could we (of course, my<br/>\nyounger brothers were allowed to watch as much sports as they wanted).<br/>\n I watched a lot of things I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to while babysitting (I<br/>\nloved babysitting for people who had a TV!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI managed to live without a TV in college (too many other things to<br/>\ndo), and I lived in Japan for 5 years, so my husband and I mostly<br/>\nwatched shows when they came out on DVD (we have quite the collection!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, where am I going with this?  Well, a little less than a year ago,<br/>\nwe decided to get rid of our TV and DVD player.  I found that not only<br/>\nwas I &quot;addicted&quot; to it (I realized how bad it was when I shushed my<br/>\nhusband during a show, and the thought occurred to me that I was doing<br/>\nwhat my parents in HS when we had a TV did that really hurt me), and I<br/>\nwas using it as a babysitter for Seth.  I also had been doing some<br/>\nreading (&quot;The Plug-in Drug&quot;) and was convinced of the evils of TV. <br/>\nHowever, lately, I&#39;ve been reading on a lot of unschooling sites about<br/>\nthe benefits of TV (which make sense to me), and between the time<br/>\nwe&#39;ve gotten rid of the TV I&#39;ve allowed Seth to watch shows and movies<br/>\non DVD or on Netflix, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re totally TV-free (and<br/>\ndespite all his watching, he&#39;s very articulate, which I attribute to<br/>\nwatching certain shows).  My biggest gripe with TV is the commercial<br/>\nprogramming, and the cost to just get basic channels (we live in an<br/>\napartment, so we can&#39;t get an antenna).  Right now, my biggest<br/>\nstruggle is the fact that it seems like all Seth wants to do is &quot;watch<br/>\na movie&quot;.  I&#39;m cool with Caillou and Curious George (esp. CG), and he<br/>\nalso likes Eloise and Harold and the Purple Crayon.  And, since we use<br/>\nour computer to watch, I can&#39;t use the computer while he&#39;s watching. <br/>\nHe also likes to play and watch (do any other kids do that?), which<br/>\ndrives me up the wall, not only because I&#39;m rather sensitive to<br/>\nmultiple sources of noise, but also because I&#39;d also like to use the<br/>\ncomputer, and if he&#39;s not really watching it, then I&#39;ll turn of the<br/>\nshow (which leads to a meltdown).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any thoughts?
