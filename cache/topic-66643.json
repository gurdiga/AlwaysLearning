(The purpose it to make sure they&#39;re real people not spambots.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost requests are from those relatively new to unschooling so it&#39;s expected their descriptions will be off. But the form their descriptions take gives insight to what they&#39;re hearing, what they need and how their need sifts and transforms what they hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems every 5th one mentions the word freedom. And if these descriptions are seen as the foundation they&#39;re building an understanding of unschooling on, their understanding is going to tilt differently than those who are building a supportive learning atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a few. And I&#39;m not making fun, not criticizing. There are internal needs and external messages that are creating these. The more we&#39;re aware of what&#39;s happening, the easier it will be to make the word choices and bring up the ideas that will help people steer away from these directions -- or make them aware that unschooling isn&#39;t what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Freedom to pursue every desire without limitation, in an environment that is fully supportive.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Allowing my children the freedom to explore their world and letting them teach themselves by reading, trying and sometimes failing<br/>\n<br/>\n* Doing something holistic for my child that doesn&#39;t include the normal societal ways of raising a child.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Letting the kids lead.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I really don&#39;t want to be around that first one&#39;s kids if they desire to kick my shins ;-) I&#39;m picturing mom cheering them on!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is using one of those as a basis for unschooling decision making, they&#39;re going to find themselves in pickles. And then blame unschooling. ;-) It&#39;s how people get the idea that whatever kids want is what parents should make happen. Like watching TV at grandma&#39;s when she wants it off during dinner. It&#39;s how people get the idea they shouldn&#39;t show their kids parts of the world until the kids ask. (How can they ask if they don&#39;t know??) It&#39;s how kids end up bored when surrounded by a house full of stuff to explore when mom sees herself as creator of the environment and not a vital part of the atmosphere herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Curriculum Schmiculum article","postDate":"1334238918","msgId":66723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM5ODg1NkYyLUMzMzEtNENGRS1BQTY2LTI3RTcwNEYyNTRBQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptNGplbSsxMDZzMUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGptNGplbSsxMDZzMUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66699,"nextInTopic":66724,"prevInTime":66722,"nextInTime":66724,"topicId":66643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I might be wrong - but I&#39;m getting that impression<br/>\nfrom online discussions and from spending a lot of (off-line/real life)<br/>\ntime with quite a few unschoolers. Mostly that impression is coming from<br/>\nthe kinds of questions newish unschoolers are asking like, &quot;Is it okay for<br/>\nme to suggest a book to read to my child?&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting to see it put this way.  I think I was hung up on that word as a way to describe our lifestyle (whether it be to myself or to someone who asked) back in the beginning of our journey.  I also described it once or twice as &quot;child-led learning&quot; too and now I cringe at that a little bit.   ;)  I can now see the problem with both and can see how it not only muddied my own thought process but also probably did nothing to help others understand it either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think I always tried to bring the world to my kids and to partner with them.  But early on, I was unsure how to do that exactly.  I read on Sandra Dodds site, Joyce site and also had read quite a bit of Naomi Aldort.  And while I have come to view Naomi&#39;s advice much differently over the years (in that I don&#39;t follow it ;) her book and specifically her steps described out in SALVE did give me a starting point to make some changes and a guide to how to respond in the type of situations.  I was I also remember reading some posts back then where someone suggested that we shouldn&#39;t need to tell our kids we love them because that should be assumed in everything we do an since our actions speak louder than words the actual words &quot;I love you&quot; were unnecessary and almost condescending.  I thought that was over the top and never adopted that viewpoint myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think &quot;trust&quot; still has a place though.  I think it depends on who you are addressing.  I think  it was a way for me to embrace the process.  Naomi talked(s) a lot about &quot;trust&quot; and that resonated with me in the beginning.   I am a midwife apprentice.  Had homebirths, etc. And we often said &quot;trust the process, this is what your body is meant to do and you are capable&quot;  Or something like that.  So I did trust the process with regard to birth.  I did not hold on to fear or even that a woman HAD to birth at home or without drugs or whatever. But in my trust of of the process I think I was a good support person to all those mothers whose births I attended.  In that same vein, I have trusted things about this journey we are as parents, but not without really looking at what I am doing, my reactions, my hesitations, in exploring ways I can build my relationships with my children and husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might also be useful with seasoned unschoolers who are already very engaged with their kids, doing all these things and just need a reminder that it is part of the process.  Or as a way to embrace what happens in life so you are not stuck in a downward, negative spiral.  There are ways to find the joy or at least peace when faced with the tougher situations in life.

I think that&#39;s an overstatement - our kids need adults in their<br/>\nlives who support their learning and create and protect an environment that<br/>\nsupports their learning and growing in happy and competent ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, kids will learn no matter what... we can trust that they will be<br/>\nalways learning...but, if parents are sitting back &quot;trusting&quot; that they<br/>\nwill learn, they could be learning that the world is mean and brutal or<br/>\nboring or that might makes right or that learning is difficult or all kinds<br/>\nof other things that we don&#39;t want them to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I didn&#39;t trust, for example, that our kids would fill their<br/>\nown lives with joy and wonder and peace and happiness....we worked really<br/>\nhard (and with great joy, ourselves) to create a lifestyle for our family<br/>\nthat would be expansive and stimulating and richly rewarding in learning<br/>\nopportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of my slightly negative feeling about the word &quot;trust&quot; is because I&#39;m<br/>\ngrowing a little concerned that unschoolers are increasingly focusing more<br/>\non trust and freedom and less on the parental role of &quot;bringing the world<br/>\nto our children and our children to the world&quot; (as John Holt put it - not<br/>\nquite a direct quote). I might be wrong - but I&#39;m getting that impression<br/>\nfrom online discussions and from spending a lot of (off-line/real life)<br/>\ntime with quite a few unschoolers.

It also carries overtones of distrust of someone&#39;s integrity and people tend to avoid implying that to be polite. It also carries overtones of implying someone needs to prove they are worthy of trust, like a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s less like a test and more like a game where we gain and lose points with someone based on our actions. Each act of trust is worth 1 point. Each act of distrust is worth increasingly more points. ... Except when someone is clearly still learning and improving.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a necessary process. It&#39;s built into our physiology. It&#39;s how we judge where it&#39;s best to put our trust and where it&#39;s best to withhold it for now or indefinitely. Anyone who pretends that process doesn&#39;t exist to be &quot;polite&quot; or &quot;nonjudgemental&quot; is going to be handicapped in dealing with people. And perhaps pass that handicap onto their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo bring it back to unschooling, we as humans are hardwired to learn. That can be given the benefit of the doubt until someone trusts. Many people don&#39;t or can&#39;t give their children&#39;s ability to learn the benefit of doubt because of warped (by school) expectations of what that learning is supposed to look like (along the way and at the end of 17 years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even though humans are hardwired to learn -- which, if someone is beginning unschooling, can be accepted as true until someone trusts from seeing it that it&#39;s true -- how much and how well humans learn depends on the environment. If it&#39;s rich and responsive to the individual&#39;s needs, that person will learn a lot. The more it&#39;s lacking in either of those, the less the person will learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child and its environment are like a car and fuel. From a lifetime of experience you can trust that a brand new car has a fully functioning engine. But if there&#39;s no fuel or the fuel isn&#39;t the right kind for that engine, it&#39;s not going to be able to function.

I think the author of those articles wasn&#39;t getting feedback and assistance from other unschoolers.  It seems to be common for people to look at unschooling and think it&#39;s simple, and then they go off and mess it up.  Or they go off and charge money (or attempt to) to &#39;teach&#39; other people how to unschool before they&#39;ve shown they know how to do it well themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Curriculum Schmiculum article","postDate":"1334068401","msgId":66648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUENTNkFYQzhmcDVYT214Y3hNeTRpN2YxdC1aVF9pYkJ4Nm9uTkozYUJvMEp6K1lrd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzOTE0QkUwLTc5QUUtNDI2My04NzY0LUM3RjA2N0RBMTAwOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGptMTE0OCtwcWdpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MTM5MTRCRTAtNzlBRS00MjYzLTg3NjQtQzdGMDY3REExMDA5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66646,"nextInTopic":66649,"prevInTime":66647,"nextInTime":66649,"topicId":66643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have to say that both her decision to unschool and her decision to school her daughters was predicated upon fear.

There was no mention of Kate ever going to high school or Molly attending alternate middle school.  And it sounds like school was entirely the author&#39;s idea, with no mention of the girls being upset with her. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the above linked followup article:<br/>\n=============<br/>\nWhen Kate turned 14, however, I started wondering if there was more we should be doing because she had already stated her desire to go to college so she could play soccer. Like most parents of unschoolers, I didn&#39;t know how unschoolers fared in the college admission game, if it was hard to get into the colleges of their choice, if they would qualify for scholarships, if they&#39;d hate college once they got there, if they could handle college work and, if they didn&#39;t end up in college, then what? I have to admit that even though I had been a passionate believer in unschooling, I secretly hoped my girls would choose to go to college.<br/>\n==============<br/>\n<br/>\nShe even concluded with:<br/>\n<br/>\n==============<br/>\nThe advice is the same as it&#39;s been all along: Keep trusting your children. Don&#39;t let cultural messages about future success and what your teen &quot;should&quot; be doing to prepare for college lead you to make fear-based decisions that could end up wasting your time and jeopardizing your relationship.<br/>\n==============<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems quite contradictory to the first article, where she said:<br/>\n=============<br/>\nMeanwhile my daughters are suspicious of me, wondering to what extent I&#39;ve ruined their lives. The worst part is that they don&#39;t feel able to remedy their situations outside the institution of school. They worry if they don&#39;t hurry and catch up, it might be too late for them, that they&#39;ll be destined to be misfits and ignoramuses. I wonder how much blame and shame they&#39;ll hurl at me before they realize I did them a huge favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was probably inevitable, the day they no longer trusted me. The gradual realization I might have done them wrong. What&#39;s so bad about school, they began to wonder. Their school friends didn&#39;t seem to be suffering. They worried that maybe times-tables and state capitals were important. <br/>\n==============<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to what Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think their unschooling journey ended when they started doing American Correspondence School (detailed in that second article), but Life Learning Magazine&#39;s definition of unschooling (a word they don&#39;t even like to use) is much more vague than that used on Always Learning.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t know that about Life Learning Magazine, and it&#39;s probably the most significant bit of information needed to explain the issues in this article.
