When my kids were younger there was a discount to ride city buses if one had a school ID, but we didn’t have one so we got them official state ID’s—like a driver’s license, but no permission to drive.  Then they could get the bus pass.  Then they hardly rode the bus, but it was still a bit of fun to go to motor vehicles with birth certificates and get IDs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe not all states will do that.
