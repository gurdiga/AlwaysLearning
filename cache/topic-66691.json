With that said, I can&#39;t organize a closet for the life of me, so please don&#39;t look!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used a semi- fly lady approach for about 15 years. Things changed when I had children. Mine are still young, 2 and 4. It&#39;s been hard, but we&#39;ve found some balance. I do have high standards in certain rooms, and I&#39;m trying to cultivate a neat and clean habit in my kids so it just seems natural to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the fly lady. 30 minutes a day maintenance is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do take out my stove every few months, as I do the frig. I try to deep clean one room  a month, on rotation. I usually do this when the kids are busy with their dad and want nothing to do with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] House cleaning.....","postDate":"1334162161","msgId":66694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZCNDAxQjY5LTEwMzItNEM2NC05OTM4LUIwNTJFRjQ4OTE3NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptNDM4NSt0Z28xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGptNDM4NSt0Z28xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66691,"nextInTopic":66700,"prevInTime":66693,"nextInTime":66695,"topicId":66691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-what about the deep cleaning like tha under the stove stuff lol.
