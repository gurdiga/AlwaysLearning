When he was <br/>\nyounger, maybe age 7/8, his dad wanted him to be in speech therapy, <br/>\nwhich we did through the school district we lived in, and then at the <br/>\nclinic at the college near us, with grad students. Neither made a huge <br/>\ndifference, and he hated it. He quit at around age 13/14 when we gave <br/>\nhim that choice, when my husband had become comfortable with allowing <br/>\nthat choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year he has chosen to go back- he is 17. He felt the speech issue <br/>\nwas getting in his way, preventing him from meeting new people and doing <br/>\nwhat he wants to do- which is playing in bands which involves a lot of <br/>\ncommunication. He has said that part of it is as important as being able <br/>\nto play an instrument. Now he feels he is getting something from it - <br/>\nand is engaged in the therapy. All the reports from the therapist <br/>\nemphasis how motivated he is. The therapy involves a lot of practice in <br/>\nvaried situations- and his confidence is increasing. He still has <br/>\n&quot;disfluencies&quot; as they call them, but he is confident that this will not <br/>\nprevent him from being understood when he wants to communicate. His <br/>\nwanting to do it has made the therapy useful to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get a newsletter from the Stuttering Foundation - and read things in <br/>\nthere often that getting kids into therapy early is the only solution. <br/>\nSo I wonder - if only we had gotten him to therapy much earlier- we <br/>\ncould have prevented the issue all together. I guess we will never know. <br/>\nWhat it important is that my son is a confident person who is pursuing <br/>\nhis dreams and seems to have as many friends as he wants to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Speech/Physical/Occupational Therapies","postDate":"1277195934","msgId":55183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyMDYxMC45NDMxMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2cDdxNitybmdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2cDdxNitybmdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55180,"nextInTopic":55184,"prevInTime":55182,"nextInTime":55184,"topicId":55136,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I see your point, Jenny.

It&#39;s not unschooling.  It&#39;s therapy.  Speech therapy is one of those new school &quot;fix the child&quot; issues.  It&#39;s not that speech therapy can&#39;t help kids that need it or that there isn&#39;t a useful place for it the world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s kind of like unschooling an autistic child.  It works the same way whether your child is autistic or not.  The details will be different, but the basic ideas will be the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your child really needs speech therapy and your child really likes it, then it seems like a good idea to do it if you have the resources.  If your child has been diagnosed at the age of 5 by a kindergarten teacher that can&#39;t understand him or her, speech therapy might not really be necessary.  If you have a child that really needs speech therapy and they really dislike it, then people here could probably help search out alternatives.  Those alternatives may be in the archives.
