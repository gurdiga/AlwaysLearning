This will be my 5th year attending - my kids and husband do<br/>\nsomething else that weekend.  I don&#39;t know when my children might<br/>\nstart going - I do know they won&#39;t be going this year either. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were sort of at a conference once.  They met Dave Shmave in the pool. <br/>\n Mostly they went to Disneyland with their dad (it was in Anaheim, not <br/>\nSacramento).  I&#39;ve been to a couple of all-family get-togethers which weren&#39;t <br/>\nreally conferences.  And Holly was with me at a MindFull conference years <br/>\nago, with lots of other kids around and not too large a range of where to go <br/>\nto find me (never outside the building, for sure).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year I&#39;m wanting to see whether they&#39;ll have fun.  Kirby works weekends. <br/>\n Marty is going with me to South Carolina, and Holly to Sacramento.  If they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have fun or I don&#39;t have fun, we probably won&#39;t do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy being away from the kids, but this year seemed like there would be <br/>\ntoo much long time with all the kids stuck home.  Any two of them can get <br/>\nalong in the absence of the third in new and creative ways.  And any one of <br/>\nthem stuck home after Kirby&#39;s not there can find another friend to visit or <br/>\nget a lot of direct dad attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5490,"nextTopicId":5493}}
