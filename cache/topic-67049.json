In the week since my younger son will not be by himself for a second and is still terrified. My husband was really upset with my mum (and our older son) because the truth is that he (DH) will watch the less grisly episodes with our older son while snuggled on the sofa, giving a sort of commentary. He knows our younger son would be disturbed. He knows our oldest loves that special time with daddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last week we have honoured our son&#39;s fear of being alone and have accompanied him everywhere (even into different rooms in our house), we have talked about why people make films like that, why people like exploring feelings of fear, why a fear centre in the brain is a good thing for animals to have etc. My husband has also found and watched the episode and chatted with our son specifically about the scary bits. They&#39;ve snuggled on the sofa watching and talking about some scenes over and over and they have skipped the ones he doesn&#39;t want to see again. He is feeling slowly better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish he hadn&#39;t seen this film, but I am thankful he could be open with us, confident there would be no shame or ridicule, and trusting we are there to navigate this with him, even if it is after the event.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nDS1(9) and DS2(7)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":377201113,"authorName":"mitrisue","from":"&quot;mitrisue&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"mitrisue","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Youtube ...?","postDate":"1336348009","msgId":67084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvNzJoOStzZzk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvNDZtMytqNWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67073,"nextInTopic":67098,"prevInTime":67083,"nextInTime":67085,"topicId":67049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dmitri has been exploring YouTube independently ever since he could use the mouse himself, maybe age 3 or 4?

I got some excellent advice from an unschooling group - possibly this one (I can&#39;t quite remember).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still wary, but we have talked about the idea of random odd clips appearing with my son (who is now 5). I can&#39;t remember what I said exactly, but he doesn&#39;t much like drama, or gore, right now, so I tried to approach it in terms of his preferences. Initially I said it was a good idea to have either one of us (mummy or daddy) check things out to be sure nothing unexpectedly alarming turns up, which he might not like. And if it does, and we switch it off, we try to explain it. My thought is to try to keep him safe, but not scare him, and keep exploring open. I figure he is learning about exploring as well as the specific YouTube itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe often wants to watch very specific things, and we usually watch YouTube together for new clips  - either my husband or I will help him navigate. He&#39;s pretty savvy now, and will hit the &#39;off&#39; button himself if something comes up he doesn&#39;t like. He also knows that our playlists and favourite lists are fine for him to watch totally alone. So he is learning to navigate (at his own pace, in his own way). At least I think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was traumatized as a child by seeing a photo (WW2 Belsen, just liberated).

Yes, it would have been better for me if someone had protected me from the images . But, more significantly, I think, with the right empathy and compassionate understanding, and explaining from a place of safety and security, I am pretty sure the impact of the photo would have been hugely reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps a little, and if my thoughts on navigating YouTube seem misguided, I&#39;d be very interested in input.<br/>\nCornelia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Youtube ...?","postDate":"1336254729","msgId":67064,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1NzA3NUJDLUE4OTctNDhBNi05OEE3LUZCNUUwREJEODdDMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvNDZtMytqNWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpvNDZtMytqNWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67063,"nextInTopic":67066,"prevInTime":67063,"nextInTime":67065,"topicId":67049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Youtube ...?","postDate":"1336253955","msgId":67063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvNDZtMytqNWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzYyMzI4MzMuNGZhNTRiODFiMzZjYUB3ZWJtYWlsLW9sZC5uZXRzcGFjZS5uZXQuYXU+"},"prevInTopic":67061,"nextInTopic":67064,"prevInTime":67062,"nextInTime":67064,"topicId":67049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** The same could be said of libraries!

At 5 and 9, I&#39;m guessing at most they&#39;d be curious and have some questions - and questions are Good! They give you a chance to talk with your kids. But if they don&#39;t really want to look at that sort of thing, there&#39;s no need to think in terms of limits and censorship - you&#39;re helping someone you care about find what interests them and avoid what doesn&#39;t. Eventually, they&#39;ll get a sense of what they want to avoid and how to do that - what kinds of buzz-words produce clips they really don&#39;t care to see.

How do kids explore and learn in general? At first, they might want or need a parent close by - exploring the woods, exploring the town, exploring the art of skateboarding, or building. But over time they gain confidence and so do you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Ray was big-time into Runescape (sort of a precursor to WoW), George and I both played a bit to get a sense of what he was enjoying and be able to talk with him about his new fascination. George played a good while longer than I did, but eventually it was just Ray playing, up late at night. By then, he was pretty good at being able to tell when he didn&#39;t want to talk to someone - when that someone was obviously there for reasons other than to play the game. I think he ever reported one or two trolls. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo&#39;s just starting to explore the wonderful world of youtube - she&#39;s 10. She&#39;s into all things Ed, Edd and Eddy and has been hunting out everything she can find. She doesn&#39;t want diversions into Ed-porn, she wants clear storytelling and decent animation, and she&#39;s better than I am at knowing how to find what she wants. I&#39;ve watched with her a little, but I&#39;m not a giant Eds fan, I keep up to know what she&#39;s interested in and be her cheering squad for her Ed-based fan art. Recently she figured out how to create a sort of film-strip of her own drawings and is working on something she hopes to upload to youtube (so that&#39;s My next  job, figuring out how one does that). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What about siblings viewing or reading together?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had a couple issues with Ray wanting to watch movies Mo didn&#39;t want to see, and made arrangements for her to do something elsewhere. I got a shock, though, one day when he was watching a Kill Bill marathon and Mo walked in - I was all set up to go into problem-solving mode and find a way for him to watch (on cable, no dvr) without her having that stuff in her face. Instead, she loved it - her background in comics and anime let &quot;get&quot; a lot of the humor that I totally miss.

They didn&#39;t stay on long, though, because a lot of things Noor wanted to see, like video drawing tutorials, where blocked because of language.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.safesearchkids.com/youtube-parental-controls.html\">http://www.safesearchkids.com/youtube-parental-controls.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---However, I am concerned with the unrestricted, freeflow connections of links in<br/>\nthe youtube format, including ones that my girls may click on without realizing<br/>\nthe content is unsavory or demeaning. And once seen, can&#39;t be unseen.-----<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re assuming, I think, that information once seen can&#39;t be manipulated, chewed on, digested.  Your kids aren&#39;t absorbing media passively so long as you&#39;re aware of what they&#39;re watching and willing to talk about it with them as much as they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unsavory&quot; and &quot;Demeaning&quot; are judgments (which you&#39;re welcome to have, although I&#39;d suggest sharing them in a more balanced and meaningful way if your kids are interested in your opinion), but your kids may find far different things to glom onto in the videos, things you may miss if you&#39;re focused on the unsavory and demeaning aspects!  They may pick up on those things as well, which I guarantee will lead to rich conversations and deep thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Like when a much younger child loves and insists on watching/reading with an older child? what about censoring? Can it help learning, or only hinder it?----<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure age is the issue here, but rather what each child wants and can handle.  If your younger child is more sensitive, have your older one use YouTube with the safe search when they&#39;re together.  Stay close regardless!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it is &quot;censorship&quot; when you&#39;re helping your child have an experience in ways that work for them.  If there are certain things *your children* are uncomfortable with, helping them avoid those clips is helpful, not hindering.  If, however, you&#39;ve decided what should be uncomfortable for them, that&#39;s going to get in the way. A child&#39;s curiosity doesn&#39;t expire because mom doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with the subject matter<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Youtube ...?","postDate":"1336240933","msgId":67053,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZEREIwQTBCLTQ2NkMtNDkyQy1BMkY4LTYxN0IyREQwQjc3REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzYyMzI4MzMuNGZhNTRiODFiMzZjYUB3ZWJtYWlsLW9sZC5uZXRzcGFjZS5uZXQuYXU+","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzYyMzI4MzMuNGZhNTRiODFiMzZjYUB3ZWJtYWlsLW9sZC5uZXRzcGFjZS5uZXQuYXU+"},"prevInTopic":67049,"nextInTopic":67060,"prevInTime":67052,"nextInTime":67054,"topicId":67049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-However, I am concerned with the unrestricted, freeflow connections of links in the youtube format, including ones that my girls may click on without","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-246772089\">-=-However, I am concerned with the unrestricted, freeflow connections of links in <br/>\nthe youtube format, including ones that my girls may click on without realizing <br/>\nthe content is unsavory or demeaning.

It&#39;s easy enough to pause or close the window.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour explanation that something is demeaning could be more harmful than a glance at something they don&#39;t understand anyway.  Sometimes a kid asks what &quot;f-u-c-k&quot; spells, and they get a fifteen minute lecture on the horrors of nasty sex and the horrors of prison-bound juvenile delinquents, instead of being told &quot;&#39;fuck,&#39; but it&#39;s not a nice word, so please don&#39;t be saying it or writing it.&quot;   When they&#39;re older, a longer explanation might be helpful if they ask.

Or advising and caution?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Forbidden fruit&quot; is a condition to avoid.  If you let them think there is something powerful and scary that they can only look at when they&#39;re older, I think they&#39;re more likely TO look at that when they&#39;re older than a child who never heard any such mysterious and fascinating thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was watching a movie with sex in it, I would pause it or change the channel if one of my kids walked in.

They (and I) have become obsessed with Harry <br/>\nPotter for around 12 months now. We love reading the books and watching the <br/>\nmovies together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest also enjoys scouring youTube for favorite scenes, particularly ones<br/>\ninvolving the developing love relationships between the characters. She became <br/>\nfascinated with watching link after link of creations and spoofs inspired by Harry <br/>\nPotter - particularly seeking out links that are funny, musical, romantic or <br/>\ncomedic skits. This has been a very rich and exciting experience for them both as <br/>\nthey watch together, however I noticed that some of the video links <br/>\nwere becoming, to my mind, increasingly sordid and cynical, and I consider some <br/>\nlinks to be inappropriate for very young children... Hence, I&#39;ve been pondering <br/>\nhow to address all this.<br/>\nI find youtube a fascinating phenomenon. It&#39;s fun and compelling to explore. <br/>\nHowever, I am concerned with the unrestricted, freeflow connections of links in <br/>\nthe youtube format, including ones that my girls may click on without realizing <br/>\nthe content is unsavory or demeaning. And once seen, can&#39;t be unseen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had conversations with the girls about my concerns and listened to their <br/>\nperspectives; and I have decided to encourage them to limit their use of YouTube. <br/>\nWe watch together sometimes and they ask me if certain links are ok...so basically <br/>\nnow I&#39;m censoring their viewing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am very interested to learn and read about others&#39; experiences with their <br/>\nchildren regarding youtube and open internet searching. A clear unschooling <br/>\nperspective please. (mine is clouded regarding this issue!) Do parents choose to <br/>\nsit with their kids and explore together? what about if the kids want to explore <br/>\non their own? What about siblings viewing or reading together? Like when a much <br/>\nyounger child loves and insists on watching/reading with an older child? what <br/>\nabout censoring? Can it help learning, or only hinder it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been on our unschooling journey for about 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nHope<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis email was sent from Netspace Webmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netspace.net.au\">http://www.netspace.net.au</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67003,"nextTopicId":67102}}
