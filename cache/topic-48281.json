We were all really tired around 10:30 after a movie. Our internet was acting up last night so we watched a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe times they were talking to MD on speaker and on Roblox were no problem because we were staying up late those nights. Well, one of the nights it was around midnight and Camden started to get easily angry and frustrated, so I knew he was exhausted. I will try to talk to him about how his brain is tired and can&#39;t think well next time. He got upset when I said we needed to go to bed, but he didn&#39;t spaz out or anything like some nights when he&#39;s exhausted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will look into getting him a Gameboy for occasional in bed transitions. I forgot about that idea. We used to have one, but it died. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we have 3 computers in one of our tiny bedrooms. It seems to work well for us, so no place for me to lay down. He prefers the only desk top. But I suppose I could talk him onto a laptop and into bed on some nights for sleep transition. Of course I won&#39;t call it sleep transition. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this stage won&#39;t last for more than another year or year and a half. He is the youngest and very exuberant person. Completely quiet is not in his vocabulary when we are at home. He is a little quiet, but he often bursts out in frustration or excitement mostly when he gets tired---as we all do. He gets super silly with non-stop noises or super grumpy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos friends and thanks for your insights!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather Brown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heather Was it better when they were talking to MD on the phone?<br/>\n&gt; What  about the other day when  our phone ran out of batteries<br/>\n&gt;  Did he go to bed then???<br/>\n&gt; MD used to stay awake longer when he was that age but he was quiet most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; That is when we used to play our Nintendo DS in bed together.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; SO the next time he was getting frustrated I talked to him to come to bed.

Maybe you could start your <br/>\nsleep prep half an hour earlier and read to him before you go to bed, or in <br/>\nbed together?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I have done in the past is make up the same food bag (with an <br/>\nice pack) that we have taken to the park and put it right by Jayn. She <br/>\nwatches tv quietly or draws or plays with her nintendo and gets her own <br/>\nsnack. These days she always seems to want hot food just as I am climbing <br/>\ninto bed. What is best is when I remember to ask her if she wants food just <br/>\nbefore I put on my pyjamas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - we have only recently - the last month - set up her own bed. It is <br/>\nnext to ours, so it&#39;s a bit like we have one super sized bed. She also has <br/>\nher own lamp affixed to the wall, and she feels like she has her own space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that you have the two boys. Maybe the noise problem is because they <br/>\nare together. Perhaps your 8yo is too young to have responsibility for <br/>\nkeeping your 5yo quiet and entertained at night. Maybe a small, portable dvd <br/>\nplayer (with headphones?) that he could watch while snuggling near you while <br/>\nyou sleep? (I sleep with earplugs - although I probably wouldn&#39;t have when <br/>\nJayn was 5.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Jayn finds it hard to go to sleep quietly and pleasantly if she <br/>\nwants a bit of dh&#39;s attention. She will be rowdy when she wants him. <br/>\nSometimes a small amount of tickle play energy expended now saves a LOT of <br/>\ncranky &quot;be quiet!&quot; energy later.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And lately he has wanted us to carry him out of bed in the morning. He <br/>\nrefuses to get up alone, although he used to for several years. This has <br/>\nbeen going on for about a month. It is not always a problem unless I am on <br/>\nthe phone working. Has anyone else experienced this regression? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot this exact thing, but a baby talk/baby voice thing that I admit is quite <br/>\nhard to listen to. The regression is like the opposite of the new big boy <br/>\nthing of staying up late. Regressive behaviors are normal at different <br/>\ntimes. The tide comes in in waves.

Normally I stay up late with them on week nights, but lately I have felt the need to go to bed by 11:30am or midnight. I work from home in the weekday mornings when they are asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past week my 5 year old has wanted to stay up until 1am. One night I decided to go to bed. He came to bed in about half an hour. Another time my exhausted husband got up and had him come to bed b/c the boys were being too loud. He is across the hall from the bedrooms when he is awake late. We don&#39;t feel he is mature enough to stay awake alone for very long. When he comes to bed he wakes us up to read a book or to go get him a snack. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lately he has wanted us to carry him out of bed in the morning. He refuses to get up alone, although he used to for several years. This has been going on for about a month. It is not always a problem unless I am on the phone working. Has anyone else experienced this regression?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have others handled these situations. I have calmly explained that is he (my 5 year old) wants to stay up to come to bed quietly and he has to be quiet after we go to bed. He is not mature enough to remember those things yet. I feel like a late night hag this past week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather Brown</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48308,"nextTopicId":48356}}
