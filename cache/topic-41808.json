My daughter is 2 1/2.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I recently posted about my daughter&#39;s current love of Dora. So of<br/>\n&gt; course it was on this morning when our friends arrived. And we have a<br/>\n&gt; BIG, HD TV so it is very attention grabbing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My friend wanted to turn it off. I talked to Marisol about it and<br/>\n&gt; turned it off and it led to a big emotional reaction, which I was not<br/>\n&gt; surprised about. I felt bad turning it off, but I also wanted to<br/>\n&gt; respect my friends wishes. We ended up compromising and I put Dora on<br/>\n&gt; our laptop where Marisol (and the other little girl) could see it.<br/>\n&gt; Marisol nursed for a little bit and calmed down and was happy the rest<br/>\n&gt; of the play date.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I know that the mom would have liked even the computer to be<br/>\n&gt; off. She commented that she has noticed that her daughter is really<br/>\n&gt; cranky after watching.... AND that the longer she watches the crankier<br/>\n&gt; she is when it gets turned off. My thoughts were that is because she<br/>\n&gt; is never allowed to watch (they don&#39;t even own a TV - just a computer)<br/>\n&gt; and that she really likes it so when she IS allowed she wants more. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t say that though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The awkward part was that the entire time we spent trying to entice<br/>\n&gt; the little girl away from Dora -- with other toys, music, dancing,<br/>\n&gt; building, etc. She was always drawn back. Marisol joined in with us<br/>\n&gt; several times of her own volition. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Overall, even with the awkwardness the play date was really enjoyable.<br/>\n&gt; I really enjoy talking with this friend. She knows that we differ on<br/>\n&gt; this issue, I have talked a little bit about not limiting TV. I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; that she thought it was a bit crazy how upset Marisol was to have it<br/>\n&gt; turned off though, and that it &quot;proved&quot; what we were doing was wrong<br/>\n&gt; (whereas in my mind she was reacting strongly because I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; listening to her and I normally do). I wonder if I should limit our<br/>\n&gt; play dates to her house because TV is not an issue there. Or should I<br/>\n&gt; talk to my friend and just tell her that I&#39;m not going to turn the TV<br/>\n&gt; off, so if she would prefer not to come here that&#39;s ok??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any input!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335633701,"authorName":"DaBreeze21","from":"&quot;DaBreeze21&quot; &lt;susanmay15@...&gt;","profile":"DaBreeze21","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: TV and Playdates","postDate":"1234206124","msgId":41945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtcHVqYys3ZHZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtbmRhNCszZGVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41929,"nextInTopic":41953,"prevInTime":41944,"nextInTime":41946,"topicId":41808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"--==the kids are 2 years old. i dont think they are going to get the whole guest thing. so if the moms want to be friends and the other mom is freaky about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1141321515\">--==the kids are 2 years old. i dont think they are going to get the whole<br/>\nguest thing. so if the moms want to be friends and the other mom is<br/>\nfreaky about t.v., they should play somewhere else.==-- <br/>\n<br/>\n--==Expecting 2 yo&#39;s to play with each other is something like magic.<br/>\n It doesn&#39;t just happen, unless there is some very interesting connection<br/>\nbetween the 2 little ones....<br/>\nIf a 2 yo is really  more interested in watching Dora, then maybe they<br/>\nreally aren&#39;t ready for playdates, and get togethers with the other<br/>\nmom and daughter should be in neutralish play ground type atmosphere<br/>\nwhere they can do their own thing along side<br/>\nof mom, while mom can talk and interact with the other mom.==--<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone for the input. I have to agree with what was said<br/>\nabove. I think trying to explain to my daughter at this point that we<br/>\ncan&#39;t have the TV on when these particular guests are over is a little<br/>\nabove her head. Definitely the best scenario(s) right now is for us to<br/>\nmeet at the other mom&#39;s house or outside at a playground. And that is<br/>\nfine. I actually was able to have the TV off before they arrived the<br/>\nplay date before this particular one -- but it wasn&#39;t easy to do! And<br/>\nthis past time I was so busy cleaning up etc, that I just didn&#39;t have<br/>\ntime to address it before they arrived.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have ALWAYS felt that play dates are more for me than my daughter<br/>\nand/or the kids we get together and babysit for. (I know that will<br/>\nchange as they get older, they are just pretty little still). It is<br/>\nfunny because I had a similar conversation with the same friend and<br/>\nanother friend a while ago. The other friend asked, &quot;well isn&#39;t the<br/>\npoint when we get together for them to play together?&quot; and my response<br/>\nto that is that my first concern is that they are all happy and cared<br/>\nfor, and the play date for me is as much about MY socialization and<br/>\ngetting some adult contact. So I really try to keep that in mind -- to<br/>\nbalance what is best for her and the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also appreciate all the discussion about boundaries in your own home<br/>\nversus another person&#39;s home versus public situations. This was<br/>\nsomething that was bothering me a little bit. I in no way meant to be<br/>\ndisrespectful to my friend, which is why I DID turn the TV off even<br/>\nthough I knew it would lead to unhappiness on my daughter&#39;s part. I<br/>\nalso felt that the computer was a good compromise for that particular<br/>\nday because otherwise who knows if we would have had any fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always, thanks to everyone for the food for thought!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: TV and Playdates","postDate":"1234155962","msgId":41929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MEU1Qzk3LTgyNDYtNDQ4Ny1CNDEwLTNDQTU3OERBQTE5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtb2Qyays1NnJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdtb2Qyays1NnJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41927,"nextInTopic":41945,"prevInTime":41928,"nextInTime":41930,"topicId":41808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I m assuming that you meant to say, the right to HER opinion?

No  <br/>\n&gt; one recommended that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i know nobody recommended it explicitly, but i still feel like inviting folks over and doing <br/>\nthings that you KNOW make them uncomfortable *is* kinda trampling their feelings. if you <br/>\nfeel you *must* do those things---that it&#39;s impossible or unreasonable to alter your <br/>\nfamily&#39;s behavior to make your friends comfortable, i&#39;d suggest discussing with your <br/>\nfriends beforehand, or meeting elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The other family didn&#39;t own the park.  It sounds like another parent  <br/>\n&gt; wanted to control her kids AND yours AND YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, like i said, i feel a lot more comfortable when folks don&#39;t curse a lot around my kids. <br/>\nat this young age, i feel like it&#39;s giving them weapons they&#39;re not equipped to wield in ways <br/>\nthat won&#39;t offend people they want to be close to. and so i *do* ask my parents, for <br/>\nexample, to try to limit their cursing while we&#39;re around. am i trying to control them? well, <br/>\nyes, in a way; i&#39;m uncomfortable with that going into my kids right now. similarly, my <br/>\nniece likes to play exclusion games (to leave my son, who&#39;s younger, out), and her parents <br/>\nare ok with that and defend it, but i&#39;ve said *i&#39;m* uncomfortable with it; he feels sad and he <br/>\nand his sister play and replay that in the days that follow when it happens here. i&#39;ve <br/>\nexplained to my niece that we aren&#39;t comfortable playing like that, and helped her find <br/>\nways to include him, or at least not-explicitly-exclude him. am i controlling her and my <br/>\nin-laws? yes, in a way, but i think most of us have things that make us comfortable and <br/>\nuncomfortable and that we can (and should) expect the people we care about to <br/>\naccomodate us as much as possible (and to explain or discuss where not possible), and <br/>\nvice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What&#39;s legitimate for her at her house might have very little to do  <br/>\n&gt; with what she should request when she visits you.

But if the visitor walked over and turned it off, I&#39;d  <br/>\n&gt; be cranky.  If she asked me if it was okay to turn it off, my  <br/>\n&gt; response would have to do with how she asked and why and whether she  <br/>\n&gt; had been invited or just dropped in.

ha! anyways, in the same way i respect that other people have their own comfort <br/>\nlevels, and things that make them uncomfortable, and that inviting them over means <br/>\nrespecting those comfort levels. some people are very stressful to have around because <br/>\nthey have *so* many requirements for their comfort that it&#39;s difficult to satisfy them all, <br/>\nand that does come into play when we consider how often to be around them or have <br/>\nthem over, but it doesn&#39;t mean that we should invite them over and knowingly make them <br/>\nuncomfortable---that seems pretty uncool to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s not like i make my kids follow EVERY rule that other folks make their kids follow (we <br/>\nlost one set of friends over the fact that i refused to make them wear shoes in the <br/>\nplayground, and to disallow them from climbing up the slide (what i *had* done is tell <br/>\nthem that the people going down the slide have priority (gravity & momentum being on <br/>\ntheir side!), so they can climb as long as someone isn&#39;t going down. they are both pretty <br/>\ngood at checking and making sure it&#39;s safe). i just felt like those were unreasonable <br/>\nrestrictions i wasn&#39;t willing to put on them. so i guess it&#39;s all up to personal discretion (did <br/>\ni spell that right?), but it does seem to me that there&#39;s a difference between hosting <br/>\nsomeone at my home (in which i feel more responsibility to make them comfortable) and <br/>\nmeeting them somewhere (i don&#39;t feel as responsible---there are TONS of other people at <br/>\nthe park, and they ALL have different rules, KWIM?).<br/>\n<br/>\nwho knows. but it&#39;s worthwhile to consider that your daughter may be old enough to <br/>\nunderstand courtesy towards her friends, and that it may be worthwhile to your friendship <br/>\nto respect your friend&#39;s feelings and beliefs as legitimate for *her*, even if they&#39;re not <br/>\nlegitimate for *you*, and to help her be comfortable & enjoy herself while she&#39;s visiting <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I wonder if I should limit our<br/>\n&gt; play dates to her house because TV is not an issue there.=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That sounds like a great idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just because she&#39;s totally wrong... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"Verna","from":"&quot;Verna&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: TV and Playdates","postDate":"1233957322","msgId":41818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtaWJrYSs4NXU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtaHE2bysxMGEydEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41810,"nextInTopic":41843,"prevInTime":41817,"nextInTime":41819,"topicId":41808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My daughter is 2 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently posted about my daughter&#39;s current love of Dora. So of<br/>\ncourse it was on this morning when our friends arrived. And we have a<br/>\nBIG, HD TV so it is very attention grabbing!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend wanted to turn it off. I talked to Marisol about it and<br/>\nturned it off and it led to a big emotional reaction, which I was not<br/>\nsurprised about. I felt bad turning it off, but I also wanted to<br/>\nrespect my friends wishes. We ended up compromising and I put Dora on<br/>\nour laptop where Marisol (and the other little girl) could see it.<br/>\nMarisol nursed for a little bit and calmed down and was happy the rest<br/>\nof the play date.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I know that the mom would have liked even the computer to be<br/>\noff. She commented that she has noticed that her daughter is really<br/>\ncranky after watching.... AND that the longer she watches the crankier<br/>\nshe is when it gets turned off. My thoughts were that is because she<br/>\nis never allowed to watch (they don&#39;t even own a TV - just a computer)<br/>\nand that she really likes it so when she IS allowed she wants more. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say that though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe awkward part was that the entire time we spent trying to entice<br/>\nthe little girl away from Dora -- with other toys, music, dancing,<br/>\nbuilding, etc. She was always drawn back. Marisol joined in with us<br/>\nseveral times of her own volition. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, even with the awkwardness the play date was really enjoyable.<br/>\nI really enjoy talking with this friend.
