Her kids are 16 and 14<br/>\nnow.  When they were little though, they routinely had garage sales<br/>\nwhere the kids would get rid of almost every toy item they owned.  When<br/>\nthey came to our house, they went hog wild and played and played and<br/>\nplayed.  Twice their whole family moved out of state and got rid of<br/>\nalmost EVERYthing, tv&#39;s, gaming systems, everything except basic living<br/>\nessentials.  They never had books really.  They had one tiny bookcase<br/>\nwhen the kids were really little that was about 2 feet wide and had 2<br/>\nshelves on it.  One quarter of it had children&#39;s books and the rest was<br/>\ncutesy stuff.  That went bye bye when the kids went to school because<br/>\nthey were officially too old for picture books and they could get books<br/>\nfrom school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that I&#39;ve noticed about kids that go to school, is that they<br/>\noutgrow toys and move through them really fast, like fads.  Perhaps it&#39;s<br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t play with them all day and grow attatched to them. <br/>\nPerhaps it&#39;s peer pressure, stuff like playing with baby dolls is for<br/>\nbabies, even at the young age of 7 and 8.

I am getting better<br/>\nover the years, but at this moment I desperately need to purge. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne advantage I have is that I organize a children&#39;s consignment sale twice<br/>\na year, so to set a good example and follow my own advice, periodically I<br/>\nforce myself to get rid of things my son has outgrown! The idea is that<br/>\nparents gather up stuff their kids have gently used, prep it so it looks<br/>\nnice, clean toys and hang clothes on hangers, and bring it all down to one<br/>\nlocation where we open to the public for 3 days and then it&#39;s over. I need<br/>\nto write a newsletter real soon here and want to include some advice on<br/>\nboxing things up to get ready for the spring sale while we all get ready for<br/>\nthe influx of xmas toys!<br/>\n <br/>\n(I&#39;m not trying to advertise, heck you&#39;d have to live in Portland or close<br/>\nby to participate in my sale! But if you want to know more about what it is,<br/>\nhere&#39;s my web site: www.passitonsales.com And I&#39;m involved in a support<br/>\ngroup with other sale owners so depending on where you live I might be able<br/>\nto refer you to a similar sale.)<br/>\n <br/>\nClothing is fairly easy to let go, except I do have some baby clothes (I say<br/>\nin case i have another but I know how easy it is to get more clothes, so it<br/>\nmust be sentimental), and I&#39;ve gotten rid of all the big stuff as soon as we<br/>\nstopped using it (swing, high chair, stroller) but it&#39;s still really hard to<br/>\nsell the toys. Even if Damon doesn&#39;t play with everything, I see the value<br/>\nin it and want to keep it around &quot;in case&quot; we need it some day. We&#39;re trying<br/>\nto redo the basement to organize all the toys because I only see more<br/>\npurchases in the future. In the meantime, there are toys everywhere, all<br/>\nover the house. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but Geoff (dh) doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course I can&#39;t resist shopping at my own sale, and thus bringing in MORE<br/>\ntoys! I&#39;ve had people over who say Damon has too many toys. I wonder what<br/>\nthat means. He does use them all, sometimes together (block towers that cars<br/>\ncrash into or towns constructed of all sorts of materials). And does it<br/>\nmatter that most of them were used before we got them and I paid very little<br/>\nfor the lot? And why do I care what other people say?! When we go to other<br/>\nhouses, it seems those kids have a lot of toys too. It&#39;s not a competiton, I<br/>\njust have a hard time getting rid of stuff. <br/>\n <br/>\nI was at someone&#39;s house last week (not a friend, just picking something up)<br/>\nwho was very proud of the fact that she had very little toys for her 2.5yo<br/>\ndd. I looked around at her immaculately clean house and felt so sorry for<br/>\nher kid! She said they&#39;d rather spend money on a zoo menbership or science<br/>\nmuseum and go to the library for books. We go to the library too, but we<br/>\nalso won a ton of books! Some things I just want to grab and read when I<br/>\nwant to, not have to wait until the library is open and hope they have it.<br/>\nWe have the memberships too, I just don&#39;t get not having toys in your house!<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com [mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Ariana Zora Ziminsky<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 15, 2008 6:33 AM<br/>\nTo: alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dealing with Influx of Toys<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - I appreciate all the ideas and thoughts on this from everyone.

The child decides which stuffed animals, for  <br/>\nexample, she wants out at present.  Right now it&#39;s Old timey ones  <br/>\n(like the classic Pooh&#39;s and knitted ones) and penguins.

The bin is clear so we can usually find the one  <br/>\nshe wants without taking it all out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the room is cleared of things the joy of having a clear space  <br/>\nreally sets in, without the fear or sadness of giving up her favorite  <br/>\nthings.

Obviously my daughter is involved in the  <br/>\nprocess so I don&#39;t put away stuff she is using or really wants to keep  <br/>\nout but I do most of the heavy lifting and sometimes she preferrs to  <br/>\nlet me do it while she watches TV or plays on the computer.

I appreciate the candor and thoughtfulness on this board.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two boys, ages 6 and 3. As the holidays approach, the issue of &quot;what to do with all the toys&quot; comes to the forefront for me. The boys get a lot of presents this time of year; we have a couple different toy storage systems set up in our living room area, the playroom, their bedroom, as well as the attic. We also have a few &#39;overflow&#39; boxes of toys for doodads. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, at any given moment, a completely broken toy can become the &quot;it&quot; toy for the moment, at the center of all their imaginitive, creative play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering how people deal with this in a way that is respectful to children, yet still honors the space we live in. In a nutshell, we need to have a way to get some toys out of the house - be it by selling them, giving them away, or tossing them in the trash.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal issue with this is that I have a strong tendency to save things that are &#39;useful&#39; or &#39;good,&#39; even if the logical side of my brain says, &quot;It&#39;s better if we get rid of it.&quot;   So, if I were to sit down with the boys and go through all the toys to decide which ones to give away, throw away, sell and keep, I can pretty much guarantee it would be **very** stressful for me, and thus, would be stressful for them as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate a cut-and-dried, step-by-step, how-to on how some of you have successfully dealt with this, if there is such a thing -- probably coming from someone who is not a &quot;keep it all&quot;-er  *or*  has overcome his/her hoarding tendencies, LOL!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ariana<br/>\n(mama to Josiah, 6, and Jaiden, 3)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41082,"nextTopicId":41004}}
