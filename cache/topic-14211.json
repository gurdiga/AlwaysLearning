He covers several songs from the movie Hans Christian Andersen in<br/>\nit (Danny Kaye starred and sang in that one), including the Ugly Duckling<br/>\nand Inchworm. His redo of the King&#39;s New Clothes is in a medley with<br/>\nEverybody Says Don&#39;t (by Sondheim) and is a great description of<br/>\nunschooling! Here are the lyrics to Everybody Says Don&#39;t:<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t <br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t right, <br/>\nDon&#39;t, it isn&#39;t nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t <br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t walk on the grass,<br/>\nDon&#39;t disturb the peace,<br/>\nDon&#39;t skate on the ice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I say do! I say,<br/>\nWalk on the grass, it was meant to feel.<br/>\nI say, sail! Tilt at the windmill<br/>\nAnd if you fail you fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t get out of line<br/>\nWhen they say that then, lady that&#39;s a sign<br/>\nNine times out of ten,<br/>\nLady you&#39;re doing just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake just a ripple, come on be brave<br/>\nThis time a ripple, next time a wave!<br/>\nSometimes you have to start small, <br/>\nClimbing the tiniest wall -<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re going to fall<br/>\nBut it is better than not starting at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody says no, stop,<br/>\nMustn&#39;t rock the boat, mustn&#39;t touch a thing<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says wait<br/>\nEverybody says can&#39;t fight city-hall<br/>\nCan&#39;t laugh at the King.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I say do, I say,<br/>\nLaugh at the King, or he&#39;ll make you cry<br/>\nLose your poise<br/>\nFall if you have to, but lady make a noise!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!<br/>\nEverybody says don&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says can&#39;t<br/>\nEverybody says wait around for miracles<br/>\nThat&#39;s the way the world is made<br/>\nI insist on miracles<br/>\nIf you do then, miracles, nothing to them<br/>\nI say don&#39;t...<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren (Patinkin fan from way back...)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14169,"nextTopicId":14212}}
