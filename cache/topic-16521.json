It has paid off - there are people we consider <br/>\ndear friends whose kids had difficulties at various times over the <br/>\nyears. There are others we&#39;ve cut off contact with whose kids grew up, <br/>\nfrom what we hear through the grapevine, to be even worse as older kids <br/>\nand teens than they were as young kids.

Say, &quot;You must <br/>\nbe right with your son at all times.

(ends in <br/>\n  preposition, can&#39;t change it).  She can choose her friends.  That&#39;s one <br/>\n  of the joys of homeschooling.  She can&#39;t be mean to him, but she <br/>\n  shouldn&#39;t have to play with him.  If she was in school she&#39;d have to <br/>\n  &quot;get along with everyone.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Second, if this boy is there, I&#39;d be right with Chloe all the time.  If <br/>\n  he&#39;s close to her, I&#39;d be just as close.  If I hear the situation <br/>\n  esculating I would step in and talk to the child.  He&#39;s 4 1/2, he&#39;s <br/>\n  getting the message from mom that he&#39;s not responsible for his behavior <br/>\n  and that others need to change their behaviors to fit his needs,--not <br/>\n  true and not good messages.  I&#39;d tell him that when he&#39;s mean, no one <br/>\n  wants to be with him, and then I&#39;d help C find something else to do.  <br/>\n  Short and sweet before mom comes over. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Third, I&#39;d teach C to be more assertive.  In this world our children, <br/>\n  but especially our girls, need to be strong assertive women.  Help her <br/>\n  practice the words &quot;when you are mean to me I don&#39;t want to play with <br/>\n  you or be around you.  If you are nice to me I will play with you.  If <br/>\n  you are mean, I will leave.&quot;  Have them say them to you in your backyard <br/>\n  in a mock situation.  Have her stand up for herself.  Pair her with <br/>\n  another little child (Lexie?  we need to come play anyway) who is really <br/>\n  good at being assertive and saying those things, so she can model.  <br/>\n  Lexie will tell him right off and she&#39;ll protect C and Janene. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sadly there are people out there who think that boys acting like this is <br/>\n  normal and accetable.  Boys will be boys, right?   If mom isn&#39;t telling <br/>\n  him that his behavior is not acceptable, then Chloe certainly has a <br/>\n  right to do so--and she needs to learn to do so.  Standing up now to the <br/>\n  childthat hits will help her stand up the to the child that says &quot;but if <br/>\n  I don&#39;t have sex my balls will fall off&quot; or some other outragious <br/>\n  statement.  So often as a little girl I (and other little girls )were <br/>\n  told to be quiet and still and meek and mild.  Not for my girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n  ps, when did you join this list?  Did I know you were on it and just <br/>\n  forgot?  Or have I completely lost my brain and you aren&#39;t the same <br/>\n  Ticia I thought you are/were? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ticia wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Please help me with some wise words and what you all do in these <br/>\n  &gt; situations.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; As a pre-unschooler ;) we spend a lot of time at parks and around <br/>\n  &gt; children of all ages and temperaments. We are having a very difficult <br/>\n  &gt; time with one particular child at our park days. This child is VERY <br/>\n  &gt; physically aggressive (age 4 1/2). His mother is very passive with his <br/>\n  &gt; assaults and usually talks to the other child (who has been assaulted <br/>\n  &gt; physically) explaining why her child attacked. The mother tends to <br/>\n  &gt; talk to other peoples kids about the aggression more then talking to <br/>\n  &gt; her child about why it isn&#39;t okay to punch someone when they are <br/>\n  &gt; frustrated, etc. I imagine to her own child it is kind of like <br/>\n  &gt; rationalizing his behavior? I don&#39;t know?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I tend to not interfere a whole lot when my daughter is playing unless <br/>\n  &gt; someone is being physically harmed or the play seems to be getting <br/>\n  &gt; especially vicious. I usually try to nip it before the escalation <br/>\n  &gt; happens with some distraction. I say *usually* because I also have a 1 <br/>\n  &gt; yr old who also needs my attention. I don&#39;t *see* everything that <br/>\n  &gt; happens like I did when I only had my dd to watch.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; So I guess what I am asking is has anyone had a situation like this <br/>\n  &gt; where a child in a group is predictably unpredictable and actually has <br/>\n  &gt; the other kids in the group afraid to play with them? What should I <br/>\n  &gt; do? Should I talk to the mom and if so what would I say? I know kids <br/>\n  &gt; go through bouts of aggression, but this is something entirely <br/>\n  &gt; different. We have known this kid for a few years now and my daughter <br/>\n  &gt; just doesn&#39;t seem to like him (she has actually asked me if she *has* <br/>\n  &gt; to be his friend). I have told her that I don&#39;t like everyone in our <br/>\n  &gt; group either, but I&#39;m not intentionally mean to them if I don&#39;t like <br/>\n  &gt; them. I have a hard time myself with confrontation, I tend to just <br/>\n  &gt; kind of stay away from people I don&#39;t care for rather then taking the <br/>\n  &gt; bull by the horns. What can I do to help her when this child is at the <br/>\n  &gt; park and she doesn&#39;t want to play with him? The mom always tells the <br/>\n  &gt; kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a force to be reckoned <br/>\n  &gt; with and most of the other kids just kind of always run away from him <br/>\n  &gt; which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :(<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I feel like signing this with a Dear Abby type of sig ;)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Signed,<br/>\n  &gt; Confused-Ticia :)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Yahoo!

(ends in <br/>\npreposition, can&#39;t change it).  She can choose her friends.  That&#39;s one <br/>\nof the joys of homeschooling.

If <br/>\nhe&#39;s close to her, I&#39;d be just as close.  If I hear the situation <br/>\nesculating I would step in and talk to the child.  He&#39;s 4 1/2, he&#39;s <br/>\ngetting the message from mom that he&#39;s not responsible for his behavior <br/>\nand that others need to change their behaviors to fit his needs,--not <br/>\ntrue and not good messages.  I&#39;d tell him that when he&#39;s mean, no one <br/>\nwants to be with him, and then I&#39;d help C find something else to do.  <br/>\nShort and sweet before mom comes over. <br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I&#39;d teach C to be more assertive.  In this world our children, <br/>\nbut especially our girls, need to be strong assertive women.  Help her <br/>\npractice the words &quot;when you are mean to me I don&#39;t want to play with <br/>\nyou or be around you.  If you are nice to me I will play with you.  If <br/>\nyou are mean, I will leave.&quot;  Have them say them to you in your backyard <br/>\nin a mock situation.  Have her stand up for herself.  Pair her with <br/>\nanother little child (Lexie?  we need to come play anyway) who is really <br/>\ngood at being assertive and saying those things, so she can model.  <br/>\nLexie will tell him right off and she&#39;ll protect C and Janene. <br/>\n<br/>\nSadly there are people out there who think that boys acting like this is <br/>\nnormal and accetable.  Boys will be boys, right?   If mom isn&#39;t telling <br/>\nhim that his behavior is not acceptable, then Chloe certainly has a <br/>\nright to do so--and she needs to learn to do so.  Standing up now to the <br/>\nchildthat hits will help her stand up the to the child that says &quot;but if <br/>\nI don&#39;t have sex my balls will fall off&quot; or some other outragious <br/>\nstatement.

We are having a very difficult <br/>\n&gt; time with one particular child at our park days. This child is VERY <br/>\n&gt; physically aggressive (age 4 1/2). His mother is very passive with his <br/>\n&gt; assaults and usually talks to the other child (who has been assaulted <br/>\n&gt; physically) explaining why her child attacked. The mother tends to <br/>\n&gt; talk to other peoples kids about the aggression more then talking to <br/>\n&gt; her child about why it isn&#39;t okay to punch someone when they are <br/>\n&gt; frustrated, etc. I imagine to her own child it is kind of like <br/>\n&gt; rationalizing his behavior? I don&#39;t know?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tend to not interfere a whole lot when my daughter is playing unless <br/>\n&gt; someone is being physically harmed or the play seems to be getting <br/>\n&gt; especially vicious. I usually try to nip it before the escalation <br/>\n&gt; happens with some distraction. I say *usually* because I also have a 1 <br/>\n&gt; yr old who also needs my attention. I don&#39;t *see* everything that <br/>\n&gt; happens like I did when I only had my dd to watch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I guess what I am asking is has anyone had a situation like this <br/>\n&gt; where a child in a group is predictably unpredictable and actually has <br/>\n&gt; the other kids in the group afraid to play with them? What should I <br/>\n&gt; do? Should I talk to the mom and if so what would I say? I know kids <br/>\n&gt; go through bouts of aggression, but this is something entirely <br/>\n&gt; different. We have known this kid for a few years now and my daughter <br/>\n&gt; just doesn&#39;t seem to like him (she has actually asked me if she *has* <br/>\n&gt; to be his friend). I have told her that I don&#39;t like everyone in our <br/>\n&gt; group either, but I&#39;m not intentionally mean to them if I don&#39;t like <br/>\n&gt; them. I have a hard time myself with confrontation, I tend to just <br/>\n&gt; kind of stay away from people I don&#39;t care for rather then taking the <br/>\n&gt; bull by the horns. What can I do to help her when this child is at the <br/>\n&gt; park and she doesn&#39;t want to play with him? The mom always tells the <br/>\n&gt; kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a force to be reckoned <br/>\n&gt; with and most of the other kids just kind of always run away from him <br/>\n&gt; which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel like signing this with a Dear Abby type of sig ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Signed,<br/>\n&gt; Confused-Ticia :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

What should I do? Should I talk to the <br/>\nmom and if so what would I say?<br/>\nYes, this happens over and over again no matter where I go (seems like).  <br/>\nSince the mom seems to not be handling it your satisfaction (which also happens <br/>\nover and over), I&#39;d trade on my relationship with the child himself.  In other <br/>\nwords, I would deal directly with the child, exactly as I would if he were my <br/>\nown, or as if we were best of friends or related or something.  I justify this <br/>\n(in case the parent gets irate) by the fact that since I go to park day, too, <br/>\nI have a relationship with the child of some kind.  I like to exercise <br/>\nintegrity in my relationships, and I like to protect my own children.  So, I would <br/>\ndo what I could to talk this kid into not doing what he likes to do to my kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least, I would provide a human shield between my kid and this <br/>\nkid, standing very nearby, acting nonchalant, even if it means I can&#39;t chat with <br/>\nother parents or do my knitting or whatever I meant to do while I was there.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not going to follow the kid around and protect *other* kids, unless it&#39;s <br/>\nconvenient to do so.  I&#39;m not opposed to watching like a hawk and stopping a <br/>\nweapon from behind as it&#39;s raised over my child, or placing a hand on the child <br/>\nto get his attention while saying *something* discouraging about the behavior <br/>\non my kid&#39;s behalf.  Not shaming or yelling or anything like that.  Simply <br/>\nsaying, &quot;don&#39;t hit him&quot; or &quot;that hurts, please stop&quot;, and then stand there to <br/>\nmake sure it does stop.  I have been known to draw the attention of other parents <br/>\nto the impending victimhood of their child, as well.  Eventually the kid gets <br/>\nthe message that he won&#39;t be able to get away with his bullying around me, <br/>\nand they end up avoiding me and my kid or, if we&#39;re lucky, changing his <br/>\nbehavior.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that some of these parents really are at a loss, or they&#39;re <br/>\noverwhelmed by other children or circumstances, or they can&#39;t see a problem, and <br/>\nso under the auspices of protecting my child, I model for them the behavior I <br/>\nwant to see them use with their child.  I have noticed that parents who I have <br/>\nmodeled for long term, with whom I am friends, actually begin to do the same <br/>\nthings eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s indirect influence, but sometimes that&#39;s not enough.  In those cases, <br/>\nyou have to decide whether the park day or activity is worth it to you, or if <br/>\nthe behavior is really serious, and you have take on the parent more directly.  <br/>\nAll the best ideas about dealing with people will be needed and it won&#39;t be <br/>\neasy or quick.  Feelings might be hurt.  But something&#39;s got to give at this <br/>\npoint, so what is there to lose?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually happened in our group and a couple of years later the parent in <br/>\nquestion *thanked* us for helping her see her son&#39;s behavior through other&#39;s <br/>\neyes.  That child is now successfully in an alternative type school (not that <br/>\nthat&#39;s a goal), and we never would have thought that could happen when he was <br/>\nyounger.  He was pretty wild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think having compassion for the child and the parent is first, and if you <br/>\ncan have that welcoming response with them that Retta explained so beautifully, <br/>\nit can go a long way towards smoothing things over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127921172,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;syltoyama@...&gt;","profile":"syltoyama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] What to do?","postDate":"1065544255","msgId":16531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDA3MTYzMDU1LjcxOTkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxNjA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxLjM0YjQyYWIxLjJjYjQzZTJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16528,"nextInTopic":16535,"prevInTime":16530,"nextInTime":16532,"topicId":16521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Keeping in mind the dynamic of the group, and the Mom s place in the group, you might be able to talk to her yourself, or it might be better done by someone","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-674746382\">Keeping in mind the dynamic of the group, and the Mom&#39;s place in the group, you might be able to talk to her yourself, or it might be better done by someone close to her, if you aren&#39;t really that close to her yourself.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd sometimes, even when confronted, such a problem doesn&#39;t get solved in a group in a way that will satisfy everyone.  In that case, you can stay close to your child or help her to be more successful in playing with that child. You can also give her the choice to exclude that child from her play.  If his Mom won&#39;t help him to learn new ways to get along, sometimes the only way for a child to learn that is to be excluded by his peers until he gets it that his behavior won&#39;t be tolerated.<br/>\n <br/>\nI recently chose to leave a group because of a situation like yours where my child was the favorite victim, but is so accommodating there was no way for me to make a fuss without upsetting my own kid.  He insisted on minimizing what was happening, and was learning to push down his own feelings.  It just wasn&#39;t happy with the social dynamic that was developing for my son and didn&#39;t see any way to fix it, so I chose to leave to protect him.  We&#39;ve since seen others make the same choice, and the problem child continues to enjoy his status in that group while several of us have made other play arrangements.  Just keep an eye on any signs your daughter is learning poor choices from being required to be nice to a child who isn&#39;t nice to her (or anyone else apparently) and remember what you want her to gain from this group, why you joined in the first place.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

We are having a very difficult time with one particular child at our park days. This child is VERY physically aggressive (age 4 1/2). His mother is very passive with his assaults and usually talks to the other child (who has been assaulted physically) explaining why her child attacked. The mother tends to talk to other peoples kids about the aggression more then talking to her child about why it isn&#39;t okay to punch someone when they are frustrated, etc. I imagine to her own child it is kind of like rationalizing his behavior? I don&#39;t know? <br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to not interfere a whole lot when my daughter is playing unless someone is being physically harmed or the play seems to be getting especially vicious. I usually try to nip it before the escalation happens with some distraction. I say *usually* because I also have a 1 yr old who also needs my attention. I don&#39;t *see* everything that happens like I did when I only had my dd to watch. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess what I am asking is has anyone had a situation like this where a child in a group is predictably unpredictable and actually has the other kids in the group afraid to play with them? What should I do? Should I talk to the mom and if so what would I say? I know kids go through bouts of aggression, but this is something entirely different. We have known this kid for a few years now and my daughter just doesn&#39;t seem to like him (she has actually asked me if she *has* to be his friend). I have told her that I don&#39;t like everyone in our group either, but I&#39;m not intentionally mean to them if I don&#39;t like them. I have a hard time myself with confrontation, I tend to just kind of stay away from people I don&#39;t care for rather then taking the bull by the horns. What can I do to help her when this child is at the park and she doesn&#39;t want to play with him? The mom always tells the kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a force to be reckoned with and most of the other kids just kind of always run away from him which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like signing this with a Dear Abby type of sig ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSigned, <br/>\nConfused-Ticia :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16590,"nextTopicId":16613}}
