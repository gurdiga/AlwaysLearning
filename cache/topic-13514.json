She never had a problem speaking with adults as she was<br/>\nsurrounded <br/>\nby them every day! She has also placed her own order to wait people for<br/>\nmaybe 6? years. Although sometimes I have gotten her order and told the<br/>\nwaitperson myself. I believe this started when ds came along. He did not<br/>\ntalk until almost 3 years old and so I would order for everyone<br/>\nsometimes and sometimes dd would do it herself. Recently I have noticed<br/>\nthat she doesn&#39;t talk as much, either. I have attributed it to changing<br/>\ninterests, more talking with friends recently and the fact that now ds<br/>\n(4) is a real chatter box who will speak at length with anyone he<br/>\nfancies. (If they stick around that long!) She sometimes just seems a<br/>\nlittle embarrassed with adults she doesn&#39;t know lately, but if they take<br/>\nthe time and really act like <br/>\nthey care you know (not just fries or fruit with that) then she will <br/>\nengage with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly D.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] talking to people, was kids and food in restaurants","postDate":"1050251725","msgId":13526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MC5mMWRkNzUxLjJiY2FlYmNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13522,"nextInTopic":13529,"prevInTime":13525,"nextInTime":13527,"topicId":13514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/13/03 8:37:01 AM, abtleo@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1390022204\">In a message dated 4/13/03 8:37:01 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So, when did your kids start regularly ordering meals for themselves,<br/>\nresponding to waitpeople, cashiers, or people at social gatherings who<br/>\npolietely say something to them?
