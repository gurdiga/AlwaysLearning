I understand he&#39;s a bit sick, so I hope  <br/>\nit&#39;s not too much for a plane ride and a hotel stay.  But he&#39;s young  <br/>\nand strong, so this probably won&#39;t phase him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kids (as adults) were going to go to Las Vegas, I&#39;d want Marty  <br/>\nwith them.  He seems to have a way with people and the world that is  <br/>\njovial and funny, yet a big, strong way of knowing what to do should  <br/>\nthey end up in a more challenging situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I know of Marty (from the symposium in Santa Fe, mostly, but  <br/>\nfrom other times of meeting him too) is that he walks in a room and  <br/>\nbrings a bit more sunshine in with him, and can sit in a chair and  <br/>\nlean back and fall, and get right back up and proceed.  He was a  <br/>\nwonderful host in the game condo, making bean and cheese quesadillas  <br/>\nfor the younger group playing upstairs on our last night there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are other elements to a 21 year old going to Las Vegas  <br/>\nfor that birthday, but Marty has a lot more going for him than your  <br/>\naverage 21 year old birthday person.  I hope Marty has a fine time  <br/>\nand I hope your unsettled, jitteriness fades.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill (who doesn&#39;t have a complete grasp of a kid in Marty&#39;s and your  <br/>\nposition, since my kids are only 15 and 11)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 14, 2010, at 12:54 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Marty turned 21 today.

I don&#39;t know whether this will count at all, but  <br/>\nhere&#39;s one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty turned 21 today.  He&#39;s going to Las Vegas with his girlfriend  <br/>\nand three other friends, all older.  The next oldest is 23, and the  <br/>\noldest is 30.  They&#39;re flying (Kirby has gone to pick them all up and  <br/>\ntake them to the airport), and are sharing one room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m worried, but not about anything specific.  Just worried that it&#39;s  <br/>\ndangerous and expensive and vaguely risky.  I called my friend Jeff  <br/>\nyesterday.  He&#39;s Marty&#39;s godfather, and also his knight in the SCA  <br/>\n(Marty&#39;s his squire), and I said &quot;jolly me up about this,&quot; and he said  <br/>\nhe would have been thrilled to have had that when he turned 21.  And I  <br/>\nknew Jeff when he turned 21.  Heck, I knew my husband Keith when HE  <br/>\nturned 21 (we weren&#39;t married until he was 27 or so).  Jeff knows all  <br/>\nthe people Marty will be with and pointed out how bright they all were  <br/>\nand how much fun they would have.  One is a nurse, so even health and  <br/>\nsafety is kind of covered.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I feel unsettled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they will be fine, in my conscious thoughts.<br/>\nI can figure they&#39;ll be fine in a sensible view of it.<br/>\nBut in my instinctive mom-parts of me I&#39;m jittery.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49570,"nextTopicId":49540}}
