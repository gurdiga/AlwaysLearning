It <br/>\nwoke up with a big question mark on its face this morning.  That always <br/>\nscares the HECK out of me, that I&#39;ll lose everything I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for thinking of her, and as usual you got PERFECT things.  <br/>\nYou have a knack for knowing what Holly likes!!<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n(Holly changed &quot;to&quot; to &quot;with&quot; on &quot;I was on the phone to AppleCare...&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that same day she said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me feel so good inside because so many schoolkids mumble when they <br/>\nread but I don&#39;t have to.   10/6/02</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11075,"nextTopicId":11085}}
