We&#39;ve played with them a bunch, and I play with them by <br/>\nmyself even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Christmas each person in my family makes a gift for each of the others. <br/>\nThis year Beth (my partner, who is a Professional Girl Scout) and Julian had <br/>\nbeen doing lots of skits for me. So I made them a kit based on Sandra&#39;s <br/>\nThinking Sticks, with characters and plot ideas for skits. You can take as <br/>\nfew or as many sticks out as you want. They LOVED it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this unschooling curriculum idea.
