My daughter, at 3, mastered writing her 8-letter name while sitting on her bed.  She spelled and wrote it properly, in sequence. She has never in her life had a spelling or writing lesson, but her questions have been answered, and her interests supported.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew, just a few months younger, does not write his 3-letter name legibly.  He has been in preschool (first a small community one, and now a private Montessori school)since age 3. He has had lessons,and hand-over-hand practice, since then. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf school could make children able to write their names, he would be able to write his.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, like so many things, each child will write when and only when they are ready.  They don&#39;t need lessons.  They need time and freedom, interest, something to write with and on...soap on mirrors? fog on the car window?  kindling wood on the driveway?  All of those and more are popular, here, and we&#39;ve got enough pencils, markers, crayons, inks, paints, and paper for a classroom, all free for our two kids to indulge in....once a month or in a glorious feast of page after page after page. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy digital camera is a godsend.  My kids both build.  My son, 8, is a gamer, and my daughter makes a lot of art, just now.  Both perform for me regularly, and they play many hours-long fantasies, alone and together or with whoever happens by.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost days, I snap at least a couple of shots of what they&#39;re up to. some days the camera just becomes a part of the fun...both love to share what they are doing, and they like that I post things on Facebook and on my blog.  They feel a little like superstars.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have incontrovertible documentation that, indeed, a vast amount of learning is happening here. At any moment, I could point someone to a dozen or more examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my gamer son, I often take pictures of him playing, report on what he&#39;s discovered during his play.  He&#39;s been playing Pokemon Diamond on his DS since he got it at Halloween, what he&#39;s learned could likely fill a few months worth of classroom hours. He loves vintage cartoons and animation - this is, in schooly terms, history and art and science and music...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think making the initial shift in perception is the hardest part.  Once I got used to it, it has gotten easier and easier. In my state, I&#39;m required to submit an instruction plan, then report quarterly, and present an end-of-year narrative. I used to spend hours trying to make them perfect, and that was time not spent with my children.  Now I know I could never fit in all the learning that is going on here, and I don&#39;t try.  I give the school enough to show I&#39;m upholding my end of the bargain, and I share the coolest stuff.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, you will see, as your son gets older, how very much deeper and wider his knowledge base is, how eagerly he soaks up new information and hoes his chosen skills...even if he never does stop finding the Playstation so fascinating!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace-<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE UNFETTERED LIFE<br/>\nwww.memismommy.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":363518215,"authorName":"claire.horsley08","from":"&quot;claire.horsley08&quot; &lt;claire.horsley08@...&gt;","profile":"claire.horsley08","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Doing remarkable stuff?","postDate":"1258838431","msgId":48756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhlOWxpditwdW9vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0RjQ0MDhBMzg2RjQyMkQ4QzFENkE5N0VGMzAwMEFBQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":48754,"nextInTopic":48758,"prevInTime":48755,"nextInTime":48757,"topicId":48749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Living in fear is a barrier to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to know the whole story from films, even documentaries. Even the <br/>\nmost objective documentarian still has a point a view. Choices are being <br/>\nmade in which footage to edit together and use. Perhaps the story was told <br/>\nwith extra sympathy for the mum because of some ideology on the part of the <br/>\nfilmmaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH perhaps the authorities have made a dreadful mistake with this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that happens when a law like this comes into being is that <br/>\nunfortunately and most likely there are going to be mistakes made, in both <br/>\ndirections. By this I mean there will be kids that are missed who are <br/>\ngenuinely being neglected or abused, and there will be kids forced into <br/>\nschool for spurious reasons. These are likely to become high profile cases. <br/>\nBut statistically most people are going to fall into the middle ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the authorities will find is that suddenly they have a huge change in <br/>\nthe way they have to work. The number of homes and situations they have to <br/>\ninspect will be enormous. The number of workers to do the job will probably <br/>\nbe inadequate. Standards will probably slide. The amount of paperwork and <br/>\nwork required to start the legal proceedings to drag kids into schools will <br/>\nbe huge. Chances are that they will start to focus on the more clear cut <br/>\nproblem kids, and leave the middle alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that they will have to do is define &quot;enough&quot;. If they have a bell <br/>\ncurve in schools (as we know they do), they will have to define a bell curve <br/>\nfor home education.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the UK is anything like here, there are probably groups mobilizing right <br/>\nnow to fight the new laws with statistics, positive outcomes and sheer <br/>\nnumbers. I hope it does not pass. I gather that in Australia homes get <br/>\ninspected when you want to home school. When I heard that I was outraged <br/>\nwhich shows that I have been living in the USA, where &quot;they&quot; need a warrant <br/>\nor probably cause to enter your home, for a long time. My Aussie friend who <br/>\nwas telling me about the home inspections had a &quot;no big deal&quot; attitude about <br/>\nit. Of course he hasn&#39;t seen my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it becomes a question of jumping through a few hoops, to have something <br/>\non paper for the inspectors, isn&#39;t it worth colluding with your son to <br/>\nproduce some busy work - with the full understanding that this is what you <br/>\nare doing - to be able to continue your happy life the other 23 hours a day? <br/>\nYou may find that some of the kindergarteny stuff would be fun for you <br/>\nboth - without the grading/shaming/comparing part that goes on in a <br/>\nclassroom situation. Play up the puzzles and strategy aspects of the <br/>\nplaystation games on paper too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that you are worried about socialization. I would think that you could <br/>\ngive that a bit of time. Perhaps he will make friends with other gamers and <br/>\nbe able to talk about that. I would look for more autonomous learners to be <br/>\nfriends with, who might have kids who love playstation and get to play a <br/>\nlot. That is not the only place to find gamers, but we all know that most <br/>\nkids are going to be restricted and limited in their gaming time if they <br/>\naren&#39;t unschoolers, so it seems likely.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;  Before we starting down the RU path - we did do a lot of stuff that <br/>\nwould have looked traditionally &#39;remarkable&#39; to outsiders - lots and lots of <br/>\nbook reading, painting, sensory play, outings, crafting.  He used to cook <br/>\nwith me and bake with me and just always be there with me doing stuff - now <br/>\nhe has unlimited tv and has discovered the playstation he does very little <br/>\nof the other stuff &#39;compared&#39; to previously.   I&#39;ve always presumed this <br/>\nwill balance itself out in the end (and still do)-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what balance would look like in your home. If you are <br/>\ncontinuing to be connected and active in meeting him where he is at with his <br/>\ninterests, maybe this amount of gaming and tv and that amount of other stuff <br/>\nis &quot;balance&quot; for now. If you are all happy that is wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever what happens here is that this is cyclic. Yesterday an inspector <br/>\nwould assume that my dd did nothing but play on her computer and watch tv. <br/>\nThe day before that she loved the Wii more than life itself - she played <br/>\nalone, she played with me, she played with her friends. If the inspector had <br/>\ncome three days ago he would have seen a girl making crafts, drawing a lot <br/>\nand reading aloud about coral reefs and sea life from a book, with the tv <br/>\noff. Last week the Monopoly board was out for three days in an ongoing game, <br/>\nand we played several of our favorite card games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are missing some of those other activities, set up the paints on a <br/>\nfolding table in the tv room and do some while you watch together. Jayn uses <br/>\nclipboards with drawing paper to draw while sitting on the sofa. Lay out a <br/>\npuzzle of some kind on the coffee table for between the games. Jayn always <br/>\ndoes a couple of things at once when watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you could consider a hand held gaming device (we love Nintendo DSI) so <br/>\nthat he can take his passion with him. This is a great way to find other kid <br/>\ngamers when out and about too.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; espcially inspectors or concerned relatives who may report us to <br/>\ninspectors, might see us i get very anxious &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI see also that you are worried about your relatives. I would go back to the <br/>\nold standby that Sandra has mentioned recently - tell them how happy you all <br/>\nare focussing on his enthusiasm and skills, and say that &quot;this is working <br/>\nreally well for now. Of course if that changes, we can always put him <br/>\nschool.&quot; It&#39;s a shame not to be able to trust your relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally sometimes it is worth really considering the worst case <br/>\nscenario. What would it take for you to move to Scotland yourself? Is it <br/>\ndoable, is it desireable? If the idea excites you, maybe it&#39;s worth looking <br/>\ninto even without the added impetus of the imminent inspections.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Choices,  <br/>\nyes.   Acceptance of preferences, sure.  But &quot;unlimited tv&quot; that&#39;s  <br/>\ncrowding out reading, painting, sensory play and outings? Maybe plan  <br/>\nyour days in advance, knowing what programs he would be sad to miss,  <br/>\nand watch those before you leave, or record them, or plan to return in  <br/>\ntime for that.   When our kids were little we would let them watch  <br/>\nlots of videos and TV--probably all the wanted-- but we didn&#39;t just  <br/>\nleave it on.   After a show ended, I&#39;d try to have something else in  <br/>\nplace (sometimes I didn&#39;t need to try--people were waiting for us, or  <br/>\nkids had called and wanted to come and play or something), and unless  <br/>\nthey knew what show was next and wanted to watch it, there was no  <br/>\nreason not to turn the TV off.  Because it had been part of the fabric  <br/>\nof their life, it wasn&#39;t a glory-box that represented freedom or  <br/>\nanything.  It was no different from the record player or the tape  <br/>\nplayer or the radio.  It could be turned on for something and then it  <br/>\nwas turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your change is very new, then I think you&#39;re right that it will  <br/>\ntaper off, and with winter here and video games being so big in his  <br/>\nlife, there might not be a change before April or May, but there might  <br/>\nbe places you could go that you could sell in a special way.  Museums  <br/>\nor other places.  Maybe you could meet another home ed family to go to  <br/>\nlunch, without the intent of matching the kids up as playmates, just  <br/>\nto have someone else there so you get a double benefit from going out.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-there are still many days where his main acitivity all day is  <br/>\nwatching tv and playing playstation.

I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow how many days a legal school year is in England, but here it&#39;s  <br/>\n180 days.  That leaves 185 to be &quot;not school days.&quot;  And if those are  <br/>\nthe days he plays games and watches TV and learns scads of stuff, no  <br/>\nproblem!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in the SW, when it&#39;s warmer maybe go to the Welsh history  <br/>\nmuseum at St. Fagan&#39;s.  I got to go last summer.  It was big, and  <br/>\nrich.   (I was going to say &quot;awesome&quot; but Brits don&#39;t think &quot;awesome&quot;  <br/>\nis as lovely as Americans do. &lt;g&gt;)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/\">http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/</a><br/>\nSo kids go on field trips to places like that, and they&#39;re rushed  <br/>\nthrough, and asked stock questions, and given dumbed-down  <br/>\nexplanations, but one child alone, or a small group of home ed kids,  <br/>\ncan linger on what they like, ignore some completely, ask all kinds of  <br/>\nquestions of the docents/guides, and REALLY, really learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a local castle.  Maybe you don&#39;t think a young child would care  <br/>\nmuch, but you could be surprised.  And rather than telling him when it  <br/>\nwas built and why, maybe just wander around after him and see what he  <br/>\nlikes.  Spiral tower stairs?  Hand-wrought hinges and nails in the  <br/>\ndoors, maybe?  Furniture?   Stone floors.  Who knows?  No sense  <br/>\n&quot;creating a unit&quot;--just go and be, touch, smell, see, hear, maybe  <br/>\ntaste (not the castle, but you could go to a pub for new and different  <br/>\nfood).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130027733,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Doing remarkable stuff?","postDate":"1258811051","msgId":48751,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhlOHFyYiszcmo3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhlOG5ubStqbzNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48749,"nextInTopic":48753,"prevInTime":48750,"nextInTime":48752,"topicId":48749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I live in Quebec but I&#39;m from France and Dh is from Germany and we used to live in Belgium, so I am familiar with homeschooling difficulties in Europe (from hearsay and doing a bit of research, obviously, since my daughter is not yet school age.)  I am also not very sure how I am going to proceed here in Quebec, if I&#39;m going to register as a homeschooler (which most homeschoolers from here advise me *not* to do) or not.  All of this has made me very aware of how I would handle a situation like that, if an inspector were to come to my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have been doing is keeping a blog of our activities, with pictures.  I have also started keeping a log (in my agenda) of things we are doing.  So far that&#39;s all I&#39;m doing, but my thought is that when my daughter becomes school age, I will (maybe ;-), in addition to these records, start translating all of this in school speak and keep a log, at least in the beginning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for 4 year olds in school reading and writing: our neighbour is 4.5 years old and goes to preschool.  He can write the first letter of his name, and recognize it, but that&#39;s it.  (He did however tell me that he could write his name, I think because to him the concept is not very clear yet.)  He doesn&#39;t count very well yet.  In brief, I don&#39;t notice all that much difference between him and my daughter.  I would be wary of what others tell you about other children.  (And of course, all children are different.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269037874,"authorName":"kazglc","from":"&quot;kazglc&quot; &lt;kazzarat@...&gt;","profile":"kazglc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Doing remarkable stuff?","postDate":"1258807862","msgId":48749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhlOG5ubStqbzNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48751,"prevInTime":48748,"nextInTime":48750,"topicId":48749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra said...

I started applying RU principles to our lives in April so thats almost 8mths ago which included lifting of TV restrictions.   He has also just got into the playstation (and so have I - lol!!) over the last 2 months and plays it A LOT!  He also likes to stay home a lot and is not really into playing with other kids when we do go to places which would make this possible - i think he prefers the predictability of playing with the adults in his life who will do what he tells them to rather than other children who might not be so &#39;obeidient&#39; to his wishes!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - *I* think all of this is fine for now - he is only 4 and *i* can see that he is doing remarkable things - the way he is mastering the playstation games and figuring out puzzles and such which sometimes i have missed!

Anyway,  in the end she has been forced back to school under the grouds of emotional neglect as they (authorities) decided her social needs were not being met.  Apparently the mum is now considering a move to scotland where the law is more relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point?  Well if they can say this girls social needs were not being met what on earth would they make of my son who doesnt even really like to play with other kids?  I&#39;m sure they would prescribe to the notion that he needs to be playing with other kids of his own age etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we starting down the RU path - we did do a lot of stuff that would have looked traditionally &#39;remarkable&#39; to outsiders - lots and lots of book reading, painting, sensory play, outings, crafting.
