Participants begin writing November 1. The goal is to write a<br/>\n&gt; 175-page (50,000-word) novel by midnight, November 30.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over talent and craft, NaNoWriMo is a<br/>\n&gt; novel-writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a<br/>\n&gt; novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved.<br/>\n&gt; Because of the limited writing window, the ONLY thing that matters in<br/>\n&gt; NaNoWriMo is output. It&#39;s all about quantity, not quality. The kamikaze<br/>\n&gt; approach forces you to lower your expectations, take risks, and write on the<br/>\n&gt; fly. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Make no mistake: You will be writing a lot of crap. And that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n&gt; By forcing yourself to write so intensely, you are giving yourself permission<br/>\n&gt; to make mistakes. To forgo the endless tweaking and editing and just create.<br/>\n&gt; To build without tearing down.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As you spend November writing, you can draw comfort from the fact that, all<br/>\n&gt; around the world, other National Novel Writing Month participants are going<br/>\n&gt; through the same joys and sorrows of producing the Great Frantic Novel. Wrimos<br/>\n&gt; meet throughout the month to offer encouragement, commiseration, and -- when<br/>\n&gt; the thing is done -- the kind of raucous celebrations that tend to frighten<br/>\n&gt; animals and small children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 2003, we had about 25,000 participants. Over 3500 of them crossed the 50k<br/>\n&gt; finish line by the midnight deadline, entering into the annals of NaNoWriMo<br/>\n&gt; superstardom forever. They started the month as auto mechanics, out-of-work<br/>\n&gt; actors, and middle school English teachers. They walked away novelists.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, to recap: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What: Writing one 50,000-word novel from scratch in a month&#39;s time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Who: You! We can&#39;t do this unless we have some other people trying it as well.<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s write laughably awful yet lengthy prose together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why: The reasons are endless! To actively participate in one of our era&#39;s most<br/>\n&gt; enchanting art forms! To write without having to obsess over quality. To be<br/>\n&gt; able to make obscure references to passages from your novel at parties. To be<br/>\n&gt; able to mock real novelists who dawdle on and on, taking far longer than 30<br/>\n&gt; days to produce their work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When: Sign-ups began October 1, 2004. Writing begins November 1. To be added<br/>\n&gt; to the official list of winners, you must reach the 50,000-word mark by<br/>\n&gt; November 30 at midnight. Once your novel has been verified by our web-based<br/>\n&gt; team of robotic word counters, the partying begins. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21188,"nextTopicId":21200}}
