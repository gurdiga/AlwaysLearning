How?  <br/>\n&gt; Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cacie started coming across cursive in books every so often, usually when<br/>\nthe book is trying to make a word or note look handwritten. I believe she<br/>\nfound it in both Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter books, among others.<br/>\nSometimes she&#39;d want to read a card or letter from someone who wrote in<br/>\ncursive, too. For a while I read stuff to her, then she started reading<br/>\nit to herself. I&#39;m not sure how well she reads it now, I think well<br/>\nenough to figure most things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe learned to write her name in cursive a couple of years ago, it was<br/>\nAll The Rage among her little clique of friends. She got kind of into it,<br/>\nsort of letter by letter, then her dad came to visit, saw what she was<br/>\ndoing, and apprently tried to teach her more than she wanted to know and<br/>\nthat was it - I found the paper she had been writing on with &quot;Dad&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Butterfly&quot; on it in his handwriting, and scribbles through all of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyway, a few weeks ago she was writing on the whiet baord and asked<br/>\nme how to make a couple of letters in cursive, and she messed with it a<br/>\nbit and then asked it I&#39;d write one new letter on the board every day for<br/>\nher to copy, which worked until the F crisis earlier this month (since I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to make capital F&#39;s in cursive, although thanks to the<br/>\nwebpage someone sent I do now :-). By then she apparently had a critical<br/>\nmass, since she&#39;d been asking for other letters too, so now she wrotes a<br/>\nnew message on the board every couple days in cursive (&quot;i love grandpa&quot;<br/>\nis there now, along with &quot;mint tea&quot; on the grocery list), and mostly<br/>\nshe&#39;ll ask me how to do one or two letters first. She probably has about<br/>\n85% of the lower case ones down now, and she knows how to connect them...<br/>\nI don&#39;t think she knows many capitals.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t write much at all, I think cursive is more art to her than<br/>\nwriting... <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it sometimes makes life easier to be able to read it, sort of<br/>\nlike it sometimes makes life easier to be able to tell time on an analog<br/>\nclock, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s essential, except perhaps for a<br/>\nsignature... but I knew a guy whose legal signature was a line with one<br/>\nloop in it, and he didn&#39;t need cursive for that... anyway, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave worried if she hadn&#39;t learned it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

I was reading it to<br/>\n&gt; him because it was written in long hand, cursive, and my son doesn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; how to read it or write it. Later when we were talking about the makeup of<br/>\n&gt; his 1750 point Warhammer 40k army and I was looking at his draftsman like<br/>\n&gt; printing of his list, I panicked. Those ugly fears that --I know how to do<br/>\n&gt; something that he doesn&#39;t --grabbed me and I asked him if he was interested<br/>\n&gt; in learning how to read or write cursive.  He said &quot;yeah that would be<br/>\n&gt; interesting, but not now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I started thinking...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is cursive obsolete?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t use it. My written communication with him [and everyone else] is<br/>\n&gt; either typed on the computer or handwritten printing, the way I prefer to<br/>\n&gt; write.

He prefers unlined paper.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what he would use as a model if he did have a desire.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone here have experience with this?   It seems like something a<br/>\n&gt; person could easily pick up if there was a need.  But what if that need<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t arrive until some vitally urgent bit of information needs to be<br/>\n&gt; understood with no time for the learning?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So is cursive obsolete?

Ultimately it helps to know how to read cursive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s one of my pet peeves. Both my ex-husband, Julian&#39;s dad, and my <br/>\npartner have illegible signatures that involve writing part of their names <br/>\nand making a messy line for the rest. If we try to cash a child support check <br/>\nat the bank they ALWAYS have to have the signature card faxed.  I hate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told Julian that it was MY stuff, but that I really wanted him to learn <br/>\nto write a legible signature in cursive. I don&#39;t care if he ever writes <br/>\nanything else in cursive. Since it was my agenda (although he agreed how <br/>\ninconvenient it can be dealing with the bank), I bribed him. We agreed on a <br/>\ncertain number of pages of practice signatures and I offered him something he <br/>\nwanted. (I don&#39;t remember what it was now, but he thought it was worth it.)  <br/>\nHe did it, he got his prize, and he can now legibly sign his name.  I never <br/>\nfelt strongly enough about another piece of knowledge or skill, figuring it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t important. But the kid can write his name. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
