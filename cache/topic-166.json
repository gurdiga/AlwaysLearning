My<br/>\n<br/>\nexperience says that the passion will grow in children if they are shown the<br/>\n<br/>\nmyriad of modeling applications in their everyday world (physics, chemistry,<br/>\n<br/>\nfinance, sports, arts, etc).

Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>\n<br/>\nthey can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>\n<br/>\nboiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>\n<br/>\nthe moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>\n<br/>\nedge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>\n<br/>\napplications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>\n<br/>\nlottery or statistics in elections or sports.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see the<br/>\n<br/>\nneed for modeling in the first place.  Interest in &quot;the need&quot; I find to be<br/>\n<br/>\nhinged on a budding interest in some tangible format.  Do they like<br/>\n<br/>\narchitecture or engineering (mud pies to model planes)?  How about<br/>\n<br/>\ncompetitive puzzles (board games, cards, video games)?  My son (12) just<br/>\n<br/>\nfinished reassembling a TV. (The picture was cutting out.)  He now knows<br/>\n<br/>\nthat the insides are not some kind of magic.  We talked a little about<br/>\n<br/>\ncircuits and assembly and troubleshooting.  In the process of finding the<br/>\n<br/>\nbroken circuit, we talked about TV signals and waveforms and how both audio<br/>\n<br/>\nand video came from the same antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of<br/>\n<br/>\nelectronics (really complicated modeling), but he now is a little more<br/>\n<br/>\ninterested in just how that stuff works.  It took him 3 days of putzing<br/>\n<br/>\naround with it, (and a $20 part) and mostly all I did was encourage him to<br/>\n<br/>\nbe careful and take small steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the greatest thing I have learned from homeschooling, it the fact<br/>\n<br/>\nthat it is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;  The other side of<br/>\n<br/>\nthat is being able to judge when the child is bored with the subject and you<br/>\n<br/>\ncan let it slide.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------- and I answered 11/6 --------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCombinatorics:<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider a lottery drawing of 3 balls from 3 separate pots of 10 balls each.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe odds of picking a specific combination of numbers is:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n1/10 * 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/1000 or one in one thousand combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow consider drawing the 3 balls from a single pot.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n1/10 * 1/9 * 1/8 = 1/720 or one in seven hundred twenty combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCombinatorics is the study of ratios.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nComputer Programming:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is more like logic than math, but the same principals apply.

Even so, it will require a rigorous effort because of<br/>\n<br/>\nhow &#39;dry&#39; the materiel really is.
