I volunteered on a Kibbutz in Israel in my 20s and was (forced) I actually volunteered... to clean up a lot that was covered with weeds and dead bushes.  What a surprise I got weeks later  when the dead bushes bloomed with the most amazing peach roses and sweet scent.  It was the beginning of seeing the wonderful lessons in nature and me embracing the simplicities in life.   I now thank my Dad and those on the Kibbutz for opening my eyes to the wonderful thing  of nature.  <br/>\nI have very fond memories of my family and I gardening together... digging/playing in the dirt literally for hours...especially the boys....I let them build tunnels and didn&#39;t get too upset when their soccer ball bounced into the tomato plants!!!  Or when they picked the carrots too soon!  We planted together, harvested and ate the wonderful things from the garden....all over the world.<br/>\nWhen I started to feel I was forcing my kids recently to help in our very large yard.   My husband and I realized we had all outgrown that season of our lives....after a 2 year process....we now live on the 17th floor in a 2 bedroom condo(only 4 now).....and I am learning new lessons watching the finches gather in the trees below.......the amazing old bricks that form some of the buildings built so long ago.....the noise of the city....the daily views outside my windows....  the elderly walking hand and hand, the homeless sleeping on the streets, dogs barking,  children laughing.......was it easy for me to think that it was gardening that changed me and everyone should garden?    Yes.....it isn&#39;t true....<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52519,"nextTopicId":52460}}
