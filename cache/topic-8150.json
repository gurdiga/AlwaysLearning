Well, it <br/>\n*seemed* that way to me anyway. ;-) Let&#39;s just say she was extremely <br/>\nsensitive to everything external-light, sound, texture. All of it bothered <br/>\nher and produced an extreme reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat seemed to help her (and me) most was lots of understanding, keeping the <br/>\nenvironment from being too overwhelming for her if I could, and finding the <br/>\nsensory input that help her integrate the best. This is not as compicated as <br/>\nit sounds. Some kids seem to always be on their heads, some are always <br/>\nswinging or hanging, some are jumping off the furniture and slamming around. <br/>\nThe idea is that they&#39;re looking for the sensory input that makes them feel <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Casey it was swinging like a monkey. She was always hanging from stuff. <br/>\nI started making sure she had every opportunity to do this. We got a chin up <br/>\nbar so she could hang from the doorways. We went to the park to use the <br/>\nmonkey bars. She started gymnastics. The sensory input helped her feel <br/>\nbetter which helped her behavior. Actually, any big body movement is a good <br/>\nidea. It doesn&#39;t have to be much, but runnning, jumping, wheelbarrows <br/>\nthrough the house, etc. spaced at regular intervals through the day can work <br/>\nwonders. There are also calming techniques, deep pressure backrubs, etc. <br/>\n(not much different from what we parents do anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nI should point out that maturing into their own nervous systems works <br/>\nwonders too. Casey rarely needs the tags cut out of her clothes anymore and <br/>\nher explosive reactions are to a minimum a now. Yet another reason why...<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good. :o)<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60467660,"authorName":"louisam1@juno.com","from":"louisam1@...","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Is this ever going to work???","postDate":"1028139359","msgId":8264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzMxLjExMTYxMC4tMTcyMDUzMy4wLmxvdWlzYW0xQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8230,"nextInTopic":8291,"prevInTime":8263,"nextInTime":8265,"topicId":8150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-750009147\">&lt;&lt;I trust that eventually Adam will come away from the TV at times, after<br/>\nI let go of my fears and subtle coercion.

It is not the TV<br/>\nwatching I object to; it is the effect it has on his personality, and his<br/>\nlack of interest in other areas.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jonathan first got his Nintendo and began to play the Zelda games<br/>\nhis personality became very intense and less aware of others around him. <br/>\nHe was impatient and hard to reason with.  I got a LOT of advice from<br/>\nfriends and family about how I should limit his exposure, even cut it off<br/>\nentirely.  I listened to myself and what I&#39;ve learned from other<br/>\nunschoolers which was that, if allowed to find his own way, he would find<br/>\na balance on his own.  It wasn&#39;t easy with others shaking their heads at<br/>\nme and it felt like it would go on forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had tried to control it for him it would have become a power<br/>\nstruggle and who knows HOW long it would have gone on.  Instead he found<br/>\nhis own balance, his behavior returned to peaceful and he realized that<br/>\nthe people around him were more fascinating and important.  This took<br/>\nabout two months but I&#39;m sure glad I stuck to my guns.  Now he has gained<br/>\nthe skills to prioritize what he values.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa, I&#39;m impressed by how open you are to all the advice you&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nhere, seems to me you&#39;re doing a great job, hang in there.

If it&#39;s scary then he needs reassurance from you to feel<br/>\nsafe.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe I&#39;ll let him watch upstairs with the rest of the family at least<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some of the &gt;time, so I can be there to observe. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably isn&#39;t the case but I&#39;m thinking dark and lonely basement. <br/>\nThat&#39;s horrible.<br/>\nYES bring him upstairs and let him watch where&#39;s he&#39;s close to all the<br/>\nlively action of the two year old and where he can ask questions and<br/>\nwhere YOU can hear the TV and stop by and say &quot;Well, that guy sounds<br/>\nmean, why would he say that?&quot;  Or whatever.   And where you can have a<br/>\nbetter idea of when he needs something to eat, or a hug or whatever he<br/>\nneeds.  My husband sometimes shoots peanuts or popcorn into my son&#39;s<br/>\nmouth from across the room.  This can be a funny and wiggly break from a<br/>\nlong TV session.   It&#39;s better if you have a dog or two who will gobble<br/>\nup the misses.   He also comes in with the squirt gun sometimes and<br/>\nTHAT&#39;s some physical activity for you!   Maybe there&#39;s not another list<br/>\nin the world that will tell you to shoot your child ...Just be ready for<br/>\nthe retaliation. ( I have banned the super soaker from the house. Man,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of water in those things! )<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We do use one for his allergies. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he has allergies maybe they&#39;re not under control as well as you think<br/>\nand he&#39;s feeling yucky and that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting crabby.  <br/>\nAlso, two year olds make grown up loving moms feel crabby sometimes, that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean moms personality is changing.   I say SHUT UP to the<br/>\ncomputer every day.  I even smacked it this morning.  ( I hurt my hand! )<br/>\n  I don&#39;t watch much TV.  At least not in the summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son likes to sleep with us.  He especially likes it when there&#39;s been<br/>\na lot of activity and we maybe haven&#39;t had as much close and snuggly time<br/>\nas he usually gets.  Maybe you could tell him you&#39;ve been missing him and<br/>\nsee if he&#39;d like to sleep with you??

They forget to eat until they&#39;re too hungry and<br/>\nworn out.  Make him snacks when he&#39;s glued to something good and take<br/>\nthem to him and see that he gets something in him.  It will help.  His<br/>\npersonality is probably not changing, he&#39;s probably just worn out and<br/>\nneeds a little extra attention from you to make sure he&#39;s getting enough<br/>\nto eat.  Honestly they forget to eat, and don&#39;t understand they&#39;re<br/>\nfeeling crabby and miserable because they need food. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid you go from a house where TV was very limited or forbidden to this<br/>\nnew unschooling freedom?   If so you&#39;ll have a process like deschooling. <br/>\nSomeone who wanted to watch TV but couldn&#39;t will watch a lot once they<br/>\ncan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when there is something difficult going on in a family ( a sibling<br/>\nwith fibromyalgia ) a well kid can get lost.  My son watched a lot of TV<br/>\nwhen I was taking care of my dying father.  Sometimes that escape was<br/>\nreally what he needed.  Sometimes life in our house was just so sad he<br/>\nneeded to get away and TV took him where he needed to go.

If he sees lots of things and places he&#39;ll know some of his<br/>\nown world is just as interesting as the worlds on TV.   Get a trampoline<br/>\n( man, I should get paid for promoting these things)  no one can think of<br/>\nanything else when there&#39;s a trampoline in the yard.  Watch out, your<br/>\nhome owners insurance will go up!   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does he like to watch?    Can you link what he&#39;s watching to an<br/>\nactivity outside the house?   Can you go to a Nature Center or toy store<br/>\nor whatever that has a tie in to what he&#39;s really liking on TV?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can find someone who will come and visit with your 14yo while<br/>\nyou take the other kids out.  I know she&#39;s stuck there but she&#39;s also old<br/>\nenough to understand the little kids are stuck too, unless you can take<br/>\nthem away.  Find a friend who will come and visit her and get out as much<br/>\nas you can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf his world is a sick sister and a worried and stressed mom he&#39;s going<br/>\nto look for a more interesting one on TV.

There&#39;s no TV at the art<br/>\nmuseum, the beach, the library, the zoo, the aquarium,<br/>\nthe park, or lots of other places. My son Andrew<br/>\nreally needed a change in environment to &quot;jump-start&quot;<br/>\nsome of his interests. Andrew is 12, and my younger<br/>\nson Will is almost two, so it can sometimes be hard to<br/>\nfind places that are fun for both of them, but not<br/>\nimpossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never personally heard of a kid who spent their<br/>\nentire childhood doing nothing but watching TV. I<br/>\ndoubt your son will end up being the first :) But ...<br/>\nTV&#39;s not all bad, in my opinion. My son still watches<br/>\nmore TV than I would personally choose for him, but he<br/>\nactually learns quite a bit from TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s very mechanically inclined, and learns a lot from<br/>\nJunkyard Wars that he applies to projects that he&#39;s<br/>\nworking on. We just got two new puppies, and he&#39;s been<br/>\nlearning about dog training on Animal Planet. He knows<br/>\nall about Macchu Picchu (I&#39;m sure I blew the spelling<br/>\non that one ...) from a special on Discovery Channel.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you!

At first I thought I lucked out with a boy, saving money on his wardrobe as compared to his sisters.  I&#39;ve probably spent twice as much on him, trying to find comfortable clothes.  Right now he can wear Target bathing suits; I guess the mesh lining is soft enough. (It has to be the small mesh, though) That&#39;s all. Haven&#39;t found a shirt he can tolerate, besides the one tie dyed his two older sisters have gone through and passed down.  I  buy used so it&#39;s softer, but it is still difficult.  I&#39;ve tried turning them inside out..nothing helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You could have taken just a moment to hug him...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I did!  He is my most snuggly child. Now though, most snuggles take place first thing in the morning, or in front of the TV.  But they&#39;re still great!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you take a step it doesn&#39;t help to say &quot;I have 900,000 steps more to take and the last three haven&#39;t been so big.&quot;  Just take your best step.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that is what I have to do, and trust things will eventually even out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight he asked me to use the computer with him...Clue Finders.  He was frustrated at the dialogue when he was ready to continue.  He blurted out &quot;shut up!&quot; at the computer, a phrase he has NEVER used previously.  So, do I just assume some violence and negativity will be witnessed while watching TV, and this could be a good thing because it brings the issue to the forefront to be discussed?  In other words, instead of sheltering him, he sees things and we talk about it?  I want him to have choices in what he watches, not only when he watches.  Maybe I&#39;ll let him watch upstairs with the rest of the family at least some of the time, so I can be there to observe.  I just hate the 2 year old being enticed by it all the time when there are so many other interesting things she might choose.  Maybe she&#39;ll still choose them!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Tiffany is still in bed.

The<br/>\n&gt; problem is with my 7 year old son.  He has hardly<br/>\n&gt; come away from the TV for the past 5 months.  My<br/>\n&gt; expectations are reasonable; I think he would<br/>\n&gt; naturally want to watch TV if there is nothing more<br/>\n&gt; interesting to do.  But, I have exhausted my<br/>\n&gt; creative abilities in finding things that interest<br/>\n&gt; him.  I have taken the advice to do what interests<br/>\n&gt; me and the other kids, and  still, he cannot pull<br/>\n&gt; himself away form the tv.   He no longer wants me to<br/>\n&gt; read to him.  He absolutely refuses.  His<br/>\n&gt; personality is changing.  He has always been more<br/>\n&gt; intense than his sisters, but now he is completely<br/>\n&gt; unable to handle any stress or frustration.  He may<br/>\n&gt; run upstairs for a snack and find that his 2 year<br/>\n&gt; old sister has moved his booster seat to another<br/>\n&gt; chair at the table, and break into a screaming fit,<br/>\n&gt; teeth clenched, hands fisted, veins in neck<br/>\n&gt; extended.  This is just one example of mild stress<br/>\n&gt; that he cannot handle.  I cannot take him out often.<br/>\n&gt;  He is So extremely sensitive to the feel of clothes<br/>\n&gt; on his skin that NOTHING is comfortable.  So if it<br/>\n&gt; is a place that accepts no shirts, we are OK!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At first I told myself he will learn from all he is<br/>\n&gt; experiencing; he will learn to take food when<br/>\n&gt; offered, so he won&#39;t become famished before breaking<br/>\n&gt; away from the tv for nourishment. (I do now let him<br/>\n&gt; eat at the tv)  I told myself he will become weak<br/>\n&gt; from lack of movement, and will naturally crave<br/>\n&gt; exercise or activity.  Has not happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I try to join him at the tv when I can.  I have a 14<br/>\n&gt; year old daughter with fibromyalgia and chronic<br/>\n&gt; fatigue syndrome who is ill in bed and needs some<br/>\n&gt; attention, and then the two year old who naturally<br/>\n&gt; demands attention, and a 10 year old girl. So it is<br/>\n&gt; difficult to find the time to join him alone.
