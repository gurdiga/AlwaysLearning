If that means all of you enjoying your dinner on a picnic blanket outside, or on the floor in the living room with music or maybe you all play a game instead of dinner then you and your husband have your own romantic dinner after toddler falls asleep... or or or.  There are a thousand different ways to enjoy your evenings together and if that includes sitting down to dinner together then great!  but on the occasions when it is not a happy, joyful experience, your job is to get at the joy, not to practice the tradition in absence of that joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Using force with toddlers","postDate":"1279490764","msgId":56169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsZTBJWDMtYXRFWGJwVzJ4WThsLVZkcjVEM1J3Z2hERG9oX2FpUkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjI0QTU3LTg1MDgtNEVDMy1BRkZCLUM3NDlDQUY2RURERkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkxdjdoZytjZmwwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NEM0MzMyMjEuMTA2MDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4JPDEwMjI0QTU3LTg1MDgtNEVDMy1BRkZCLUM3NDlDQUY2RURERkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56150,"nextInTopic":56170,"prevInTime":56168,"nextInTime":56170,"topicId":55995,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Specifically, I mean. Is it the sitting? The table? The food? The sociability? The way you feel? Do you Have To have all those things together or its null and void and your family falls to pieces? Its worth thinking about, because while your little guy seems to be okay with the situation, he may not stay that way - kids&#39; tolerance for that sort of thing changes. Is it worth it to insist on &quot;sitting down together at the table as a family to share a meal&quot; if it results in him resenting the whole process?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other ways for kids to learn to value sharing meals than a required sit-down dinner. My kids aren&#39;t required to share meals - my partner and I enjoy sharing our meals, so we tend to eat together whenever we&#39;re home, dinner but also breakfasts and lunches when we can. The kids are invited, but never required, and we try to accomodate their different food preferences. At times they join us for dinner. At times they don&#39;t. At times they join us but don&#39;t eat - just socialize, the way friends do in real life, having already eaten but wanting to share company. Along the way, they&#39;ve picked up polite table manners, learned to set the table, learned how to behave in restaurants and relatives&#39; homes. It didn&#39;t take a daily requirement, just &quot;want to join?&quot; And making joining us something they enjoy doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Using force with toddlers","postDate":"1279475456","msgId":56144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMjI0QTU3LTg1MDgtNEVDMy1BRkZCLUM3NDlDQUY2RURERkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDNDMzMjIxLjEwNjA1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGkxdjdoZytjZmwwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEM0MzMyMjEuMTA2MDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":56142,"nextInTopic":56150,"prevInTime":56143,"nextInTime":56145,"topicId":55995,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Sitting down together at the table as a family to share a meal is a ... -=-Is your us supposed to include your 2 year old?-=- I was walking back from","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-153049597\">-=-&gt; Sitting down together at the table as a family to share a meal is a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; very important tradition for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-=-Is your &quot;us&quot; supposed to include your 2 year old?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI was walking back from the grocery store thinking about this  <br/>\n&quot;important tradition&quot; line and Pam had responded, but her response  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t go the way I would&#39;ve.

For the times when the car seat and going in the car just <br/>\ncan&#39;t be avoided try and have lots of time to spend getting into the car seat. <br/>\nSee if you can address any of the things that may be making her uncomfortable in <br/>\nthe car. Simon never liked that I couldn&#39;t sit next to him when I was driving so <br/>\nI held his hand as I drove and I talked and I sang and I did lots of things to <br/>\nmake being in the car pleasant. Lining his seat so that he was more comfortable. <br/>\nBuying a new seat when the old one no longer fit him well, those things made a <br/>\ndifference. When David was driving I would sit next to Simon. My boobs were <br/>\n(probably more so now) relatively elastic so I could nurse him as we drove. That <br/>\nhelped make it easier for the next trip. But there isn&#39;t much you can do to make <br/>\nsure each time she likes being in the car. Make it easier, make it better and <br/>\nmake it rarer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging her diaper is the same deal. Let her be naked more. Simon and Linnaea <br/>\nloved being naked. It&#39;s summer, you can spend more time outside. Make the <br/>\nchanging more pleasant, more relaxed. Talk and tickle and be affectionate and <br/>\ngentle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 18 months neither Simon nor Linnaea were sitting down at meals much. They&#39;d <br/>\ncruise with food in their hands and the dog following hopefully. They&#39;d sat in <br/>\nchairs when they were littler, but at that age they just didn&#39;t want to sit down <br/>\nand eat. So I&#39;d feed them as they moved. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 18 months it&#39;s about helping them to move into what you need them to do next <br/>\nand making sure what you need them to do is truly something you need done then <br/>\nand now. When Simon was little I read Dr. Spock&#39;s book and one suggestion that I <br/>\nremember was if you take a toddler for a walk expect a block to take an hour at <br/>\nleast. It is hard that the period that needs the most patience is the period <br/>\nwhen you may have the least practice, you have to try and learn to go slowly to <br/>\nmove with less purpose and to trim those &quot;have tos&quot; down. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: tamara.needham &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tamaraneedham@...\">tamaraneedham@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 13 July, 2010 22:39:18<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Using force with toddlers<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading a lot of articles and books related to unschooling <br/>\nphilosophies in parenting.

Is your goal for her to do what you want when you want her to do it? If so, she&#39;s telling you pretty clearly that she&#39;s not always capable of doing that - maybe because of her age, or temperament, or a combination of those. If you can step away from that goal, you&#39;ll find you have more options! <br/>\n<br/>\nSlow down. Expect everything you do with your young children to take a lot of time. Plan that into your life - because everything Is taking more time than you want it to, right? Step back and let things take even longer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s the same struggle when changing her diaper, or trying to get her to sit in her chair for mealtimes.  It didn&#39;t used to be a fight but it keeps seeming to get worse.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nSlow down. See that you&#39;re part of the fight - and you can choose not to be. Does the diaper have to be changed exactly right now in exactly one way? Does she have to sit exactly in that chair at exactly that time? All the examples you gave are of the sorts of things that could really grate on the nerves of a busy toddler - they want to go, go, go all the time, not stop and be confined at someone else&#39;s say so. So look for ways to accomodate that go, go, go. <br/>\n<br/>\nBring her snacks and finger-foods while she plays. If a family meal is super-important, find ways to make that fun for her - and making sure she&#39;s had plenty to eat beforehand is one way to do that. Have some fun game or activity for &quot;meal time&quot; so that hanging out at the table is something she&#39;ll enjoy doing, rather than trying to combine it with food and not lining up with her natural apetite, making the meal a chore for her. Alternately, make dinner something special for you and your dh without an expectation that the kids join you - invite them, but don&#39;t expect them. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for alternatives in changing her diaper - have you tried changing her standing? That can work well for busy, active kids who don&#39;t want to stop for a change. You could look into different kinds of diapers to see if any of those give her more of a sense of control over the situation - that&#39;s often a big issue in diapering, since kids can feel so out of control when they&#39;re &quot;being changed&quot;. Give her options - maybe she&#39;d feel better about things if she got to pick the diaper, or take it off herself, or go bare for awhile. Maybe she&#39;d like to be the one to decide when its &quot;time&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Whenever it&#39;s time to get in the car I have to force her<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who decides when its &quot;time&quot;? Are you scooping her up and putting her in, or helping her figure out how to transition? Transitions are often hard for little ones, they need a lot of help for awhile. She might need to bring part of what she&#39;s doing into the car to help her feel more settled. Or maybe there can be super fun car games and toys to entice her out. For awhile I&#39;d wait to go out until I could expect Mo to be ready for a snack and that was part of getting in the car: &quot;let me get you strapped in so I can give you your snack.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe could also need time to play In the car - do you ever do that? Just sit in the car and let her explore? That can help. She might need time to play for awhile before getting in her seat, kind of a slower transition. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287618285,"authorName":"Karen Buxcel","from":"Karen Buxcel &lt;thewildtribe@...&gt;","profile":"blackhillsdoula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Using force with toddlers","postDate":"1279064249","msgId":56006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltTUhadFRXbXFWNFhRdGZXTG9XN1RnZGlqZkE2SS1qWHV0SUtaZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxaW1lNitsbDV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxaW1lNitsbDV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56005,"nextInTopic":56021,"prevInTime":56005,"nextInTime":56007,"topicId":55995,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For the carseat, can you find something interesting for her to hold, look at, do, eat while buckling her in?

(or, leave it off! My<br/>\nfavorite solution to this one!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor sitting at mealtimes, don&#39;t make her sit.  Allow her to move,<br/>\ncome, and go as she wishes.  Create a lower to the floor table that<br/>\nsuits her perfectly for standing while eating and playing.<br/>\nI wonder who ever made up that rule, anyway!  That we *must sit* while<br/>\nwe eat?  Why?!?! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/13/10, tamara.needham &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tamaraneedham@...\">tamaraneedham@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have been reading a lot of articles and books related to unschooling<br/>\n&gt; philosophies in parenting.

If you  <br/>\nlive where it&#39;s really hot, bring the carseat in, maybe, or take  <br/>\nsomething cold out (zip-loc bag of ice maybe) and wipe it on the seat  <br/>\nso it&#39;s cool.

(Maybe a  <br/>\nrefrigerated &quot;corn bag&quot; or some such would be nice to hold and play  <br/>\nwith.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor diapers, look on baby sites for lots of ideas.  Changing diapers  <br/>\nisn&#39;t really an unschooling topic, and it&#39;s not something you can  <br/>\nleave up to the child much.   You can still go with principles of  <br/>\ncomfort and quiet and gentle handling, and aim for those even if you  <br/>\ncan&#39;t always succeed.   We used to sing or tell stories during diaper  <br/>\nchanges.   Just telling the story of what had been happening in the  <br/>\nhours before would be recognizeable and while the baby was listening  <br/>\nreally hard, the diaper would get changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":441627888,"authorName":"tamara.needham","from":"&quot;tamara.needham&quot; &lt;tamaraneedham@...&gt;","profile":"tamara.needham","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Using force with toddlers","postDate":"1279057158","msgId":55995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxaW1lNitsbDV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56000,"prevInTime":55994,"nextInTime":55996,"topicId":55995,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been reading a lot of articles and books related to unschooling philosophies in parenting.
