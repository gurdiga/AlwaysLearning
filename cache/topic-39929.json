Having those around has sparked conversations both about myths and about the Trail of Tears, initially, and then as I thought about where the Apache live and realized that they wouldn&#39;t have walked that Trail I looked it up on the internet and discovered the specifics it of the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like Louise Erdrich&#39;s books. She has a lot of novels about a group of related and unrelated individuals living on an Anishinaabe reservation in North Dakota that are really good and well developed. She has also written a few children&#39;s books. She has a series called Little Frog that begins with The Birchbark House, the only one I&#39;ve read. Again, it&#39;s a really well told story of an Ojibwa family life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was young one of my favorite books was about a girl named Mary Jemison. She was a child of parents who had immigrated from Ireland to America and were living in Pennsylvania. They were attacked by Shawnee Indians, and most of the family were killed. Mary, however, survived and was sold to two Seneca sisters whose brother had been killed and who adopted Mary. I have more than one version of her life, they are both children stories. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.letchworthparkhistory.com/jem.html\">http://www.letchworthparkhistory.com/jem.html</a> is a small biography of her life. Oh, wow, here is the book of her life: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_nlmj00.htm.\">http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_nlmj00.htm.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fantastic book that I read a few years ago called 1491: New Revelations of the Americas before Christopher Columbus. Oh, it is a really good book about what life was like in the Americas prior to &quot;discovery&quot;. It&#39;s isn&#39;t romantic, it isn&#39;t a lens painted with vaseline that makes you think of Native Americans as less or more than other people. I really liked that book. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Chris and Kelli Bailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdbailey_99@...\">cdbailey_99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 8 November, 2008 6:02:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] native americans in history<br/>\n<br/>\ni spent a long time at the oyate site--thanks for sending the link. they have a list of &quot;not recommended&quot; books, and i was surprised at how many of the titles were familiar to me.  i was not familiar with the list of books which were recommended.  my 10yo son was interested in the childrens&#39; stories there.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy kids are asking hard questions, so i told them we would get more information from the library and look for dvd&#39;s to rent online.  the trail of tears runs through where we live (the path of the creek indians, anyway).  within an hour&#39;s drive are the indian mounds, part of the railroad route and several museums with native american artifacts.  there are also several historic marker locations.  i&#39;m sure we will find enough locally to feed their interests, assuming they don&#39;t end with the festival!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the suggestions,<br/>\nkelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

The traditions of the different groups/tribes can vary widely. I don&#39;t really have any ideas for a quick introduction into Native Americans in general. My family has been pretty surrounded by Native culture all of my life, both due to location and my dad&#39;s job. We live in southern New Mexico, very close to the Mescalero Apache Nation, and my dad worked with the tribe quite a bit and had many friends on the reservation. <br/>\nWe also have close friends whom we consider family who are Laguna Pueblo (mom is Laguna, dad is Spanish, actually). Apache and Pueblo traditions are very different. <br/>\nI don&#39;t know as much about the traditions of the other Native peoples in the US as I do Apache and Pueblo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would search online for the specific festival that you will be attending. Since it is a festival, there will probably be more stereotypical images present than usual. Many may be in full ceremonial clothing. I have met people though, who came to the southwest truly expecting all indians they met to be wearing deerskin dresses and feathers. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a website that gives a history of the Mescalero:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.innofthe\">http://www.innofthe</a> mountaingods. com/mescalerohis tory1.asp&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.innofthe\">http://www.innofthe</a> mountaingods. com/mescalerohis tory1.asp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is a website with some info about the Laguna and other Pueblos:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indianpu\">http://www.indianpu</a> eblo.org/ 19pueblos/ laguna.html&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indianpu\">http://www.indianpu</a> eblo.org/ 19pueblos/ laguna.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe library should have children&#39;s stories by Native American authors, and about their beliefs and traditional life. We have tons of them, ones I see in this room are <br/>\nSnail Girl Brings Water, a Navajo story, retold by Geri Keams<br/>\nLittle Man&#39;s Family (also Navajo), by J.B. Enochs<br/>\nCircle of Wonder: A Native American Christmas Story, by N. Scott Momaday (Jemez Pueblo story, there is another version also that I haven&#39;t seen) <br/>\nSing Down the Rain, by Judy Moreillon (Papago)<br/>\nAntelope Woman, an Apache Folktale, by Michael Lacapa<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene in the Addams Family Values where Wednesday and Pugsly are in the Thanksgiving play is great, that could be an opening to talk about Thanksgiving myths. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.
