I just joined this interesting and friendly group. <br/>\n My name is Lucie (yes  French spelling).  I met Sandra at our HBLN <br/>\nconference in Ottawa, Canada.  Hope you are feeling better.  I broke my <br/>\nleg a few years back.  I ended up with screws in the ankle (later <br/>\nremoved) and a plate with 7 screws on my fibula ( there forever). <br/>\n Physiotherapy were most helpful for me.  Also, because I end up <br/>\nfavoring the good leg, I  developed lower back problem.  Chiropractic <br/>\ntreatments were most helpful with that.<br/>\nI have three sons ages 15,15, and 10. I&#39;m a mother of twins.  My sons <br/>\nhave never been to school.  I have never really &quot;school&quot;  them either. <br/>\n I prefer the philosophy of educating by providing opportunities, books, <br/>\ncomputers, and other medium access...  After visiting family this <br/>\nholiday, I realized even more how different we have become.  For one <br/>\nthing , we are happier.  I too have met friends of like mind within the <br/>\nhome educating community.   It&#39;s a great life!<br/>\nFriendship<br/>\nLucie in Canada  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Leslie530@...\">Leslie530@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hello!
