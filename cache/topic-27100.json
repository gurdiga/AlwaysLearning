When we first started unschooling I printed out little bits of conversations that would address my husbands concerns.  Ones that really went &quot;ah ha!&quot; to me too.  He&#39;s obviously missing some pretty important points about unschooling if he doesn&#39;t see that playing games is unschooling, which you&#39;re seeing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about Pam L.&#39;s article about gaming:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/articles/Everything_I_Need_To_Know_presentation.htm\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/articles/Everything_I_Need_To_Know_presentation.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat touches on a lot of other unschooling points too, not just gaming.  When we were starting,  I printed out a lot of these types of articles.  I&#39;d leave them around and make some comment like, &quot; Wow, these are really interesting.
