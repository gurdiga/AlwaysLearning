Having strong personal values means being extra sensitive to how information is shared with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean not sharing. It does mean sharing as much as the child wants to know.

Adults with power to change things forget how powerless and helpless kids can feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent is putting sensitivity for the ills of the world above a child&#39;s feelings, they&#39;re doing more ill at home than they can fix out in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m glad Martin Luther King chose a life of activism and I bet his kids are too! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a child hears &quot;No, there are hurting people that need me&quot; more than a handful of times when they&#39;re small, the child isn&#39;t going to think &quot;Wow, my parent is so great to spend time helping people.&quot; They&#39;ll think how their parent doesn&#39;t like them as much as they like other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they get older, they might understand if the feeling of neglect wasn&#39;t too crushing.

If all parents believed that there should be peace in all the world before they can have peace at their house, there will be no peace in ANY of the world.  There are people whose children are grown, or who have no children, who can immerse their lives in sorrow and injustice.

And I<br/>\n<br/>\nthink there should be reminders of that every day because it is all too<br/>\n<br/>\neasy to forget others&#39; suffering when it isn&#39;t in our face. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you really didn&#39;t mean it.

Over the years, as he has researched and learned and lived, he has decided to only eat organic or &quot;happy&quot; chicken (no other meats). He chose on his own to cut out fast food after he learned about the nutrition value. He gave up aspartame when he was 9 because I told him about the research concerning the substance. I give him all of the information I can give, on both sides. We talk about it and he makes his own decisions. This didn&#39;t happen over night. Xander ate hamburgers for years. He wanted to eat them, so he got to eat them. <br/>\n<br/>\nBuying a little organic or local, free range meat to serve at home isn&#39;t a bad idea. We stopped going to restaurants because it&#39;s so expensive. That money goes to organic groceries. It&#39;s a good trade off for us. Buying local, in my experience, has proven to be the best and most trustworthy for true cruelty free meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did: I showed Xander a video about how chicken nuggets were made. I did not say one word about what I believed. I showed him the video and he decided to never eat another chicken nugget. This is the video by Jamie Oliver: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKSoiDtdi9s\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKSoiDtdi9s</a><br/>\nYou can buy natural hot dogs at Whole Foods or a local natural grocers. I get the chicken ones and they have no nitrates or anything &quot;bad&quot; in them. Just chicken and flavor. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy unschooling philosophy is my life philosophy and it&#39;s about freedom of choice. My son chooses to eat meat even though he knows I am a vegetarian. This is his choice.

It was a miss assumption from my friend who thought I fed her meat.  At that time I took the hot dog off her plate and she was upset for a little bit.  I think it was the act of taking it away more than the fact that I didn&#39;t want her to eat meat that upset her.  Of all the meats Hot dogs are the last thing I would want to feed her.  She wanted to have a hot dog several months earlier (thanks to Mickey Mouse&#39;s Hot dog song) so I substituted it with a tofu dog.  Turns out she didn&#39;t like it, so I thought good that need has been resolved. However, I would imagine it&#39;s a temporary resolution, until the curiosity comes back. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am ok with people eating meat.  My issue is corporate farming and the way animals are pumped with by products such as hormones and antibiotics etc. As well as abused and severely neglected. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After my daughter was born, I always thought that I would not allow her to eat meat until she understood the process behind it.  It&#39;s not my intention to slam her with you&#39;re killing an innocent animal, shame on you kind of explanation.  I want her to know where her food is coming from (which I already promote by taking her to local farms).  I know an easy answer would be to feed her organic free range meat, but it&#39;s not that easily available where I am and it&#39;s more expensive AND free range doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the live stock are living in a good environment.  Furthermore, where she will ask for meat is where it is served.  How do you prepare for that? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for advice from other vegetarian parents raising their children with the unschooling philosophy.  What worked in a positive way for you?  What should be avoided?

I believe all lives should have a chance to be free and to live a full long rich life of their choosing. I dislike seeing animals penned up, for example birds in cages, when it is their right to be free to explore the world that belongs to them just as much as it does us. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra- I believe in showing my child the sorrow that exists in the world while equally showing her the happiness that exists. Ironically, a lot of the happiness that exists is when we are able to help the sorrow of the world; to help those in need. How fulfilling and powerful to know that we can make a difference to the issues that our world faces! My household does not live in a false bubble that life is all rainbows and laughter, but neither do we think that life is all pain and sorrow. How about just reality? Life is both. I think it&#39;s great to learn how to help that sorrow, and consequently enrich our lives in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 12/9/11, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Vegetarian and unschooling<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, December 9, 2011, 7:53 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      -=-It is unfair not to post my replies, too. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean?

Passions are something else entirely - something that&#39;s a mild interest for me might be a passion in one of my kids, or something they find dull and uninteresting, no matter how big a deal I make of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another good idea is to bring vegetarian alternatives like smart dogs, veggie burgers etc. to every gathering you go to where you daughter might feel left out or tempted.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the sort of thing which is a good idea if your child has allergies or serious food sensitivities, but doesn&#39;t work so well for something like vegetarianism because kids are natural explorers. They Want to Try things. It&#39;s not a terrible thing to let them explore.

Now and again, if we&#39;re out, I&#39;ll get her some chicken nuggets because that&#39;s about the only fast food she&#39;ll eat.

It can be hard to see how that works when your kid is still a toddler, but you have Years to talk about this in little bits and pieces. You don&#39;t have to dump the whole picture on a kid who asks &quot;what&#39;s that smell?&quot; or &quot;what&#39;s pork?&quot; Give short answers without any drama and wait and see if there&#39;s a follow-up question.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids often go through a &quot;what&#39;s it made of?&quot; stage and/or a &quot;where does it come from?&quot; stage, which are good times to have those kinds of conversations.

I grew up vegetarian because my family was. My mom never pushed it on me, judged me, or made me feel that she would be disappointed if I ate meat. I never did eat meat, and I am still a happy vegetarian today, probably because it felt like a choice I made myself and wasn&#39;t forced on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my own daughter it was always the same, I felt whatever direction she went I would want to support her 100% (or try my hardest) because I care about her. The thing is she took vegetarian on as her own, and has never wanted to eat meat so far (now 11). I am a proponent of speaking the truth when it comes to meat. It can be an age appropriate version, but I think that people should always know the three basics things: that meat is an animals body, that the animal was enslaved by people for it&#39;s whole life and usually denied basic needs, and that it suffered. And I think there should be reminders of that every day because it is all too easy to forget others&#39; suffering when it isn&#39;t in our face. If someone chooses to meat after that, then at least it is an educated choice. Even if a 3 year old has made the choice to taste meat, if you keep up nonjudgmental dialogue about meat, she will probably choose to be vegetarian sooner or later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is to have someone take it on as their own passion and love and who they are. But that can sometimes be tricky. You don&#39;t want them to be passionless about it as if they&#39;re just doing it to please you or whoever. You want them to be proud to be a vegetarian because it is a choice they made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome good ideas are for your daughter to make vegetarian friends, watch artistic Youtube videos by vegetarians (there&#39;s a lot of cute songs), get vegetarian books (victor the vegetarian etc.), vegetarian potlucks and other vegetarian outings, vegetarian magazines... Do you have a support group in your area?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good idea is to bring vegetarian alternatives like smart dogs, veggie burgers etc. to every gathering you go to where you daughter might feel left out or tempted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you good luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nTova<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 12/9/11, kgagnier0424 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kgagnier0424@...\">kgagnier0424@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kgagnier0424 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kgagnier0424@...\">kgagnier0424@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Vegetarian and unschooling<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, December 9, 2011, 11:24 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      I have a 3 and 1/2 year old daughter who seems to be ok with not eating meat at the moment so I&#39;m looking for advice (preferably from other vegetarian parents) on what to do when the subject of meat does comes up.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a small situation at a halloween party, where I looked down to see she had a hot dog on her plate.

My husband and I are not vegetarians, but we do buy 100% of the meat and eggs we eat from local farms where we know the farmers and have personally seen how they raise their animals.  We are fortunate to have a strong local food network around where we live - and also to have the time to go to the farms to get our food instead of to the grocery store :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son ate the meat we bought up until he was two, at which point he announced that he didn&#39;t want to eat animals any more.  He also (before giving up meat) ate McDonald&#39;s hamburgers and chicken nuggets once in a while, and always by his own request.  Even though neither my husband nor I choose at this time to eat McDonald&#39;s meat, we didn&#39;t deny him the opportunity to do so - because he was curious and interested and that food looks good to little kids!  So denying him McDonald&#39;s because I don&#39;t like where their meat comes from didn&#39;t seem a joyful choice.  Filling his head with factory farming realities also didn&#39;t seem a joyful choice - when he asked &quot;why don&#39;t you eat a hamburger too?&quot; I would answer &quot;I&#39;d rather eat hamburger from a farm I know.&quot;  He would smile and happily munch his meal. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs he got older, he asked more questions about meat, and about why we buy our meat from farms when most people buy it from grocery stores.  I kept answers simple, and still do - he knows that typical hen houses are over-crowded, for example - and he knows that grocery store meat animals don&#39;t get to go outside and run around and enjoy their lives like the animals do on the farms he loves to visit with us when we pick up meat.  He doesn&#39;t know about the sort of things you see in hidden-camera You Tube animal activist videos, and I hope he won&#39;t for some time to come, as that&#39;s a lot for adults to take in never mind kids :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I recently asked him if it bothers him that his dad and I eat meat.  He said quite happily, &quot;Why would it?  I&#39;m not you!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s good to consider when someone thinks about how much influence they want over someone else&#39;s choices.  We&#39;re not our kids - and our kids aren&#39;t us.  I have something of the opposite situation of what you&#39;re experiencing, in that I&#39;m not the vegetarian in the house - but I still think there are parallels, and I also wanted to share because I think our situation illustrates the idea that keeps coming up here and there in unschooling discussions - that when we parent with attachment to outcomes, we don&#39;t always get what we expect anyway :-)  I provide the organic (usually), non-factory-farmed (always) meat you mention wanting your daughter to eat - but my son chooses not to eat it.  And from my unschooling point of view that choice is his to make, just like if he suddenly wanted to stop at Burger King for a Whopper this afternoon I&#39;d be ok with that too  after all, I&#39;m not him, so I wouldn&#39;t be the one eating it :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Vegetarian and unschooling","postDate":"1323453494","msgId":64200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFEN0MyRDBCLTg0NUMtNEYwQi04Qzk4LUNBM0YzMDdBMTMzNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpidGNuNys0cTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpidGNuNys0cTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64198,"nextInTopic":64202,"prevInTime":64199,"nextInTime":64201,"topicId":64198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But it&#39;s not a message a 3 yo or 6 yo or 8 yo who is fully dependent on you to meet their wants and needs will hear with the understanding you have. A young child can&#39;t explore the world without your help. You brought her into the world. You&#39;ve chosen unschooling where a big part of the philosophy is trusting children to explore and decide what is good and bad for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you want to decide for her. You want to stack the information deck in favor of your point of view. If what you believe is right and true, don&#39;t you think she&#39;ll decide that for herself if she&#39;s given the opportunity? Why do you think she&#39;d reject it? And if she would, why would you want to create propaganda to get her to think the way you want her to?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s perfectly possible to live our values for ourselves while supporting kids in exploring what they believe to be good and bad for themselves. If you impose the value on her, you&#39;re likely to tie negativity from the control to the value.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to feel the mind-controlishness of fundamentalists, skin heads, parents who put high pressure on academics or sports, parents who groom their children for beauty pageants -- any values we disagree with -- for raising their kids in a bubble of what is the right way to think, not letting the kids decide for themselves.  It&#39;s not so easy to see the same type of thought when its our own beliefs that we&#39;re sure are the right way to believe that we want our kids to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":477347526,"authorName":"kgagnier0424","from":"&quot;kgagnier0424&quot; &lt;kgagnier0424@...&gt;","profile":"kgagnier0424","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Vegetarian and unschooling","postDate":"1323447847","msgId":64198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpidGNuNys0cTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64200,"prevInTime":64197,"nextInTime":64199,"topicId":64198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a 3 and 1/2 year old daughter who seems to be ok with not eating meat at the moment so I m looking for advice (preferably from other vegetarian parents)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1604945293\">I have a 3 and 1/2 year old daughter who seems to be ok with not eating meat at the moment so I&#39;m looking for advice (preferably from other vegetarian parents) on what to do when the subject of meat does comes up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a small situation at a halloween party, where I looked down to see she had a hot dog on her plate.
