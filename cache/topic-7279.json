I have a question about Oregon.  I would absolutely love,<br/>\n&gt; love,<br/>\n&gt; love to move to Oregon...specifically Portland or Lake Oswego.  And you<br/>\n&gt; live<br/>\n&gt; in Lake Oswego and moved from California .  Hereπs my question; how have<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; adjusted to the lack of sunshine?  That is the only thing stopping us<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; moving from Southern Cal.  I have visions of weeks and weeks with no <br/>\n&gt; sun.<br/>\n&gt; Is that the case?  How do you adjust?  Do you get depressed?  Portland <br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; always rated as one of the best places to live and lots of people just<br/>\n&gt; love<br/>\n&gt; it, but what about<br/>\n&gt; the sun!!! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Isabel&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Isabel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I love the rain and even bemoaned the lack of it in San Diego so <br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t too much of an adjustment for me.  I have had one episode of<br/>\n&gt; depression that I can remember and thankfully we had a couple days of <br/>\n&gt; sun<br/>\n&gt; right then.  I mentioned this to my doctor and she said that even when<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s overcast you get the benefits of the sun if you go outside for a<br/>\n&gt; bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oregonians do everything in the rain; mow the lawn, eat outside (under a<br/>\n&gt; cover), go for walks, etc.  There are a lot of available indoor<br/>\n&gt; activities and people here seem to look forward to the winter months as<br/>\n&gt; their time to cocoon.  Some of my friends have a few full spectrum <br/>\n&gt; lights<br/>\n&gt; around the house, they say it helps so I&#39;m gonna give it a try next<br/>\n&gt; winter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My one recommendation would be to find a place which offers the kids <br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; space to move.  I live in a small space but I try to keep a space in my<br/>\n&gt; living room for jumping, wrestling, etc.  My furniture is open ground <br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; climbing and jumping.  However, kids don&#39;t seem to mind playing in<br/>\n&gt; jackets, gloves and rain boots either.  We have a membership to the<br/>\n&gt; Children&#39;s Museum which is good for a few hours of wandering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have a long summer here too with a lot of sun and temps around 80,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes around 100 but not for long periods.  Lake Oswego is a pretty<br/>\n&gt; little town but the lake is not a good choice for swimming, very silty<br/>\n&gt; and leeches.  There are plenty of indoor pools available though.  We are<br/>\n&gt; not actually &quot;in&quot; Lake Oswego even though our address says we are, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; more like Lake Grove.  We are just across the freeway from Tualatin and<br/>\n&gt; Tigard and it&#39;s only about 10 minutes in different directions to<br/>\n&gt; Portland, Beaverton, Oregon City and Milwaukee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\n&gt; Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\n&gt; Join Juno today!

I told her that we&#39;d moved from there a year and a half ago.  It<br/>\n&gt; turns out that her and family moved here last year from England.<br/>\n&gt; They lived about an hour away from where we did and her<br/>\n&gt; husband was born and raised where we lived in London for 4<br/>\n&gt; years.  She was born and raised in Lafayette, CA (just across the<br/>\n&gt; bay from where I was born and raised).  She has 2 daughters<br/>\n&gt; aged 6 and 8 (Tamzin is 7).  Oldest was born here and they<br/>\n&gt; moved to England when she was a year old.  Second one was<br/>\n&gt; born in England.  Needless to say, we have all become good<br/>\n&gt; friends.  After all, we have so much in common!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meghan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
