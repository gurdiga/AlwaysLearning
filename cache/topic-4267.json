I got an email from<br/>\n&gt; Zack (my oldest, currently in PS, living with his conservative christian dad<br/>\n&gt; and seciond family in GA.) He is fundraising for a program at their baptist<br/>\n&gt; church for bibles to give to pakistanis in the area. He wanted me to donate<br/>\n&gt; money. I told him I was very uncomfortable donating money to a cause like<br/>\n&gt; that. He knows how I feel about proselityzing and also about the religion<br/>\n&gt; his father and stepmother are forcing him to embrace (no I am not using too<br/>\n&gt; strong a word they are extremely coercive parents) I felt terrible and as if<br/>\n&gt; I was not supporting him in his endeavors but I finally decided that it was<br/>\n&gt; much more important for him to see an example of someone who felt strongly<br/>\n&gt; about their beliefs and stick to them. He understood. I also suggested to<br/>\n&gt; him that if he felt strongly that passing out the bibles was important, he<br/>\n&gt; should donate a portion of his allowance.

I might offer suggestions about ways he could make extra <br/>\nmoney to do so, but I would definitely tell him why I had a problem with it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s important to me to &quot;walk my talk,&quot; and important to me to model that to <br/>\nJulian.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4249,"nextTopicId":3974}}
