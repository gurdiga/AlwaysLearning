Seems that could flower into more discussions of  <br/>\ntypes of arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tool for debating (and for just about everything, all kinds of  <br/>\nlogic) is to play 20 questions a bit, and learn what kinds of guesses  <br/>\nare bad guesses and which are good ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could start with the numerical version, where someone guesses a  <br/>\nnumber between 1 and 1000 in 20 guesses.   Here&#39;s an online version of  <br/>\nthat if you don&#39;t want to do it on your own.  The only answer to each  <br/>\nguess can be &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funbrain.com/funbrain/guess/\">http://www.funbrain.com/funbrain/guess/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had written about 20 questions, but I guess I spoke about  <br/>\nit at a conference.   The strategy is to try to divide the world in  <br/>\nhalf with each question.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith debate, when someone is trying to divide the world in half, it&#39;s  <br/>\nusually a logical fallacy, or it&#39;s creating a dichotomy when ends up  <br/>\nbeing kind of &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;stupid bad guy,&quot; so by playing the game  <br/>\nsome, you could learn to recognize when someone&#39;s doing that, or in  <br/>\nyour own arguments, to only divide in half that part of the world/ <br/>\nthinking that you&#39;re dealing with.   If you don&#39;t want to compare  <br/>\napples to oranges, how will you divide and compare the apples?   And  <br/>\nif you&#39;re talking about apples produced commercially, for shipping,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s no sense talking about fragile kinds of apples that people  <br/>\ngrow and eat at home but aren&#39;t suitable for packing up and storing  <br/>\nand shipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the recent videos of me is on a blog I was looking at this  <br/>\nmorning.
