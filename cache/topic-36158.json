I can say, at the ripe<br/>\nold age of 38, that trying hard, over and over, to get your family to be<br/>\ndifferent or understand you and your point of view, is really a waste of<br/>\ntime and a waste of energy for you and your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ll get flack for this, as it&#39;s just so not socially acceptable to<br/>\n&quot;give up on&quot; your family.  And it&#39;s just commonly accepted that it&#39;s the<br/>\n&quot;right thing&quot; to do to keep a comfortable relationship going with your kids&#39;<br/>\ngrandparents.  But from my experience, when you finally stop making all this<br/>\neffort, which in my case resulted in all sorts of stress for me and my<br/>\nhousehold (three little kids, a husband who&#39;s awesome and patient), your<br/>\nlife dramatically improves.  There&#39;s room for new friendships, new<br/>\ninterests, more time and energy left for your kids and spouse, the list goes<br/>\non....  I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say this:  Quitting my family made me a<br/>\nmuch happier person.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not suggesting that you tell your mom to stay away or stop<br/>\nanswering the phone.  I did these things and they worked for me.   But I<br/>\nthink my relationship with my mom, based on your description of yours, was<br/>\nway more deteriorated than yours, so.... But I do think stopping any back<br/>\nand forth exchange that puts you in the position of explaining yourself or<br/>\nplacating your mom or apologizing for being who you are or pretending like<br/>\nsome mean thing she said never happened, should stop.  For your own peace of<br/>\nmind. Don&#39;t call her back if she leaves mean messages.  Refuse to discuss<br/>\ntopics that are critical to your kids.  Just end them.  She can leave your<br/>\nhouse if she doesn&#39;t like it.  I really believe it helps to have<br/>\nboundaries.  I figure if my kids want to have a relationship with my mother<br/>\nor father when they&#39;re older (right now they have zero interest---there was<br/>\nnever much of a connection to begin with)  then they can pursue that.  But<br/>\nright now, it&#39;s my job to teach them by example that letting people treat<br/>\nyou like crap isn&#39;t a necessary part of life.  I realized that I was just<br/>\nplaying out an old script from my childhood, over and over again, and that<br/>\nno one was interested in changing that script.  So I quit the play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came to this over many years of struggle, so it&#39;s hard to just tell<br/>\nsomeone to implement it right away.  But I was compelled to write because I<br/>\nthink my approach, what might be called the zero tolerance approach, is way<br/>\nunderrated in our society.  Whenever I bother to tell any new person in my<br/>\nlife about it, I usually get knee- jerk arguments to the contrary.  I don&#39;t<br/>\npost a lot, but the thing that always gets me going is when someone talks<br/>\nabout how they&#39;re tying so hard to make a mean person be nice or learn to<br/>\nlive with someone being mean to them.  It just isn&#39;t necessary.  And it<br/>\nisn&#39;t your job to learn to live with it and &quot;rise above it.&quot;  That&#39;s not<br/>\nhuman nature.  When your mother says repeated mean things to you, you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be expected to just let it roll off.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy little bit o&#39;wisdom--<br/>\nBarb<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jul 5, 2008 at 4:31 PM, Jay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jay.ford79@...\">jay.ford79@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   This has been an ongoing problem but not a huge issue in the past<br/>\n&gt; because my kids hardly see this particular grandmother (my mother).<br/>\n&gt; She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (very low grade,<br/>\n&gt; excellent prognosis) and she called to say she was miffed my kids<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t send her cards or call her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mind you my kids have never been close to her at all. When the kids<br/>\n&gt; were younger she&#39;d come over and all she&#39;d want to do was take<br/>\n&gt; pictures and create Hallmark card moments. She&#39;d bear gifts but<br/>\n&gt; then expect my kids to drop everything and play with them the way<br/>\n&gt; she envisioned. She would get ticked that they wanted to do<br/>\n&gt; something else, or play with whatever in a different way, etc. She<br/>\n&gt; always has and still does speak to them in a sing-song-y baby voice<br/>\n&gt; (they&#39;re 10 & 14). She can&#39;t just BE with them and spend time with<br/>\n&gt; them and talk to them. Consequently my kids have never sought her<br/>\n&gt; out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally don&#39;t have (and never have had) a good relationship<br/>\n&gt; with my mother. She has demonstrated time and time again that she<br/>\n&gt; prefers to go out of her way to help other people and not her own<br/>\n&gt; family. Holidays are supposed to be picture-postcard perfect and no<br/>\n&gt; deviations from what she envisions allowed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I give this background because after she mentioned that my kids<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t send her cards (and hinted that I should have forced them to<br/>\n&gt; because it was the right thing to do she said) that she said that<br/>\n&gt; she has never and will never agree with unschooling, that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; horrible and my kids are going to pay for it later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This came out of the blue. I was taken aback a bit because she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; never even tried to get to know my kids as people. Why does she<br/>\n&gt; hate unschooling? Because I have deprived her of her rights as a<br/>\n&gt; grandmother because there are no awards to hang on the fridge, no<br/>\n&gt; bragging rights, no soccer games, no graduations or plays or all<br/>\n&gt; that stuff, therefore she can&#39;t brag on her grandkids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway the point of this ramble is that she blames unschooling for<br/>\n&gt; the bad relationship with her grandkids. The fact that she never<br/>\n&gt; even tried to just spend time with them and be with them and get to<br/>\n&gt; know them fell on deaf ears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She doesn&#39;t want to educate herself on unschooling (obviously hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; in 14 years).
