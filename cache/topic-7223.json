My dd had a mild <br/>\ncase and I, apparently not having had them in childhood, got an <br/>\nINCREDIBLY bad case. It was almost (almost) fun watching the pox pop up <br/>\nEVERYwhere--every conceivable place on my body. It got so bad I couldn&#39;t <br/>\ntake a shower or wash my hair  because the water hurt too much. I just <br/>\nlay there smelling and looking so much like something from a horror <br/>\nmovie that we took pictures. My friend still talks about coming to visit <br/>\nand being horrified, trying to be supportive and sweet to me but being <br/>\nutterly repelled and fascinated at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan, pock-free (except for a few scars on my forehead; aren&#39;t bodies <br/>\namazing?)<br/>\n<br/>\n(btw, Eric hadn&#39;t heard anything about red spiders in Australia. As we <br/>\nspeak, he&#39;s in the air going to Figi. What seems like an incredible <br/>\ndestination really doesn&#39;t interest him that much at this point. He&#39;s <br/>\nsick of warm weather and beaches--true Minnesotan, I guess--and wants to <br/>\ncome home. but the way his ticket was set up he has to spend a week <br/>\nthere. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to see him next week !  !  !)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7416,"nextTopicId":7312}}
