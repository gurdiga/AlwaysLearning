If he wants to go into the <br/>\nmilitary he will have to meet their specifications.  If he wants to <br/>\ngo to college he will have to jump through their hoops.  Some are <br/>\nvery open and do not require any diploma, GED, or even SAT/ACT test <br/>\nscores for desirable students.  Others are real snippity about all <br/>\nthese things.  Best that he get his goals together, researches his <br/>\noptions, so that he can meet the requirements that are appropriate <br/>\nfor what he wants to do.  It really will be up to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter (now 16) went to a summer college program this past <br/>\nsummer and fell in love with the college where this was held.  She <br/>\nhad attended various programs at several other colleges before this <br/>\none, but she now says that this is the one where she wants to go to <br/>\ncollege.  They were great, a very liberal liberal arts college, <br/>\nlisted in The Fiske Guide To Getting Into The Right College as one of <br/>\nthe &quot;Top Nonconformist Colleges.&quot;  It was a perfect fit for her.  <br/>\nThey asked for a transcript, references from teachers and counselors, <br/>\nand SAT/ACT scores.  I made a nice homemade transcript, and told them <br/>\nthat I did not believe in SAT/ACT testing and explained why.  Then I <br/>\ntold them I would write references, as her teacher and counselor, if <br/>\nthey wanted, but since I was all of the above, they might be a bit <br/>\nredundant.  I suggested I could get references from others, like her <br/>\nskating coach, or her mentors in various volunteer programs in which <br/>\nshe has participated.  But they were satisfied, it seems with what I <br/>\nsent, and not only accepted her, but offered her a full scholarship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is that he begin to clarify his goals.  Then it will be <br/>\neasier to see what it will take to meet those goals.  Of course if he <br/>\nis not ready for this, then it may take a while longer, perhaps years.<br/>\nAnd there are so many options out there now that even college can be <br/>\ndone from home, getting a fully accredited four-year degree for less <br/>\nthan $700 to no more than $5000, depending on what route the student <br/>\nchooses.  It&#39;s his life.  I am sure he will figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Graduate&quot; v.
