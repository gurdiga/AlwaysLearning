This recipe was not in any of my cookbooks. <br/>\nI think the sugar or honey adds a certain something special.<br/>\nI used organic collards from Wild Oats.<br/>\nI sprinkled a bit of balsamic vinegar on the greens after cooking. <br/>\nFlavorful, juicy, tender, very good. <br/>\nDh liked it too, but my kids are still insecure with new foods, especially when they are green!<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for sharing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sharon Rudd <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 10, 2002 9:42 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 220:Greeens<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n  About 2lb ( a mess) fresh, WASHED, locally grown<br/>\n  collards (local may be the difference), cut up with<br/>\n  most of the thick center vein removed. Cover with<br/>\n  water in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>\n  of vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>\n  traditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>\n  canola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>\n  sugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>\n  honey would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>\n  all together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>\n  are how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>\n  vinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>\n  crumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>\n  Seminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>\n  it)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>\n  brothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>\n  overs can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>\n  heated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>\n  pot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>\n  Collards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>\n  iron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>\n  folks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>\n  brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>\n  other good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>\n  K and ????<br/>\n<br/>\n  Adrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>\n  willing to try new foods. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4714,"nextTopicId":4716}}
