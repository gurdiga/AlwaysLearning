YAY!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote and gave the eulogy for her this morning, and wanted to <br/>\nshare it with <br/>\n&gt; you all. This is in honor of my mother, Carole Baptista. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some time ago I realized that I inherited most of the passions I <br/>\nhave in my <br/>\n&gt; life from my mother. Through her love of learning and books, <br/>\nlove of travel, <br/>\n&gt; her quiet respect for those she cared about, and her pragmatic <br/>\nstrength, I <br/>\n&gt; have learned to build a life I love. And my mother was <br/>\nunwavering in her <br/>\n&gt; support of that.<br/>\n&gt;     You need to understand-my mom was NOT a teacher. <br/>\nAlways brilliant - she <br/>\n&gt; always knew the Jeopardy answers-she was told she could go <br/>\nto Teacher College <br/>\n&gt; or not at all. Well, in high school the nuns at her school had put <br/>\nher in <br/>\n&gt; charge for months of a class of younger students, and she&#39;d <br/>\nhated it. So she <br/>\n&gt; chose not at all.<br/>\n&gt;     But she loved learning and passed that along to us. When <br/>\nmy sister and I <br/>\n&gt; were kids, my parents led interesting lives, and we were <br/>\nalways welcome to <br/>\n&gt; join in. So we constantly had journalists, activists, local <br/>\npoliticians, and <br/>\n&gt; dozens of other interesting people around. Rather than being <br/>\nsent to our <br/>\n&gt; rooms, we were invited to hang out, and our ideas were always <br/>\nlistened to. We <br/>\n&gt; had adventures. One night my parents had friends over and <br/>\nthey spontaneously <br/>\n&gt; decided to have breakfast in Montreal. We all packed into the <br/>\ncar and went.<br/>\n&gt;     That respect for us has made a huge difference in my life, <br/>\nespecially <br/>\n&gt; impacting what kind of parent I wanted to be.<br/>\n&gt;     My mom used to say she liked us more as we got older and <br/>\ncould have more <br/>\n&gt; interesting conversations. We shared books, stories about <br/>\nthings we did, <br/>\n&gt; conversations about politics and the world, and stories of <br/>\ntravel. My mom <br/>\n&gt; always loved to travel, and early in her illness had plans to join <br/>\nmy family <br/>\n&gt; on a trip to Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. Her illness <br/>\nunfortunately <br/>\n&gt; interfered with her joining us, but she loved hearing about the <br/>\ntrip when we <br/>\n&gt; got back, and especially appreciated our lighting a candle for <br/>\nher at the <br/>\n&gt; shrine in Fatima, Portugal.                <br/>\n&gt;     Whatever we talked about, from the time I was very young, I <br/>\nknew I&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; listened to completely and with respect.<br/>\n&gt;     She was a very pragmatic person, and the highest praise <br/>\nshe bestowed on <br/>\n&gt; anything was, &quot;That&#39;s practical.&quot; When she said that in <br/>\nresponse to telling <br/>\n&gt; her that qwe&#39;d decided to homeschool my son, I laughed, <br/>\nbecause &quot;practical&quot; <br/>\n&gt; was the last thing I thought it might be. But I knew she <br/>\napproved, especially <br/>\n&gt; when the next thing she said was &quot;It&#39;s too bad we didn&#39;t know <br/>\nabout that for <br/>\n&gt; you.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     Even before that, my mother unconditionally supported me <br/>\nwhen I fell in <br/>\n&gt; love with my partner, Beth, participating in our union service. <br/>\nShe always <br/>\n&gt; treated Beth like a much-loved daughter-in-law.<br/>\n&gt;     Over the years my mom has bonded with her grandchildren - <br/>\nover cartoons <br/>\n&gt; with little Journey, Harry Potter with Sean, and Star Trek with my <br/>\nson <br/>\n&gt; Julian, who was astounded at how much she knew about it.  <br/>\nOne of her concerns <br/>\n&gt; was that no one would want her huge collection of owls. She <br/>\nwas pleased when <br/>\n&gt; Julian told her he would like to adopt them.<br/>\n&gt;     In the end, my mother was still helping me learn. A little over <br/>\na month <br/>\n&gt; ago, after my sister Cheryl called to tell me my mother&#39;s <br/>\ndecision to enter <br/>\n&gt; hospice, I decided I needed to go help take care of her. It <br/>\nmeant taking a <br/>\n&gt; leave of absence from work and being away from my family, <br/>\nwithout knowing how <br/>\n&gt; long. I would just have to trust.<br/>\n&gt;     Being with my mom as she went through this was the most <br/>\nimportant thing <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever done.
