Other ideas are *everywhere.*  Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; discussions are rare, and if they become discussions about everything<br/>\n&gt; else, there will be no unschooling discussions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If unschoolers seem defensive, perhaps it&#39;s because they  have<br/>\n&gt; something worth defending.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are criticized and misunderstood by mainstream families just as<br/>\n&gt; all homeschoolers are.

The treatment was inhumane. The kids were afraid, they were screamed at, they were shamed, they were made fun of by the kids not in the class.  After a year of this so called professional training, I did not see one child become better at anything in any way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know about unschooling then and I had never looked into homeschooling but my gut told me that these kids should somehow be at home.
