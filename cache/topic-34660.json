He grumbled the whole way to the pool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we got there, DS happily put on his bathing suit, with no mention of<br/>\n&gt; the feelings he had in the car ride.  He swam and had a blast.  We ended up<br/>\n&gt; staying there for 4 hours!  When we got in the car, I asked both kids,<br/>\n&gt; casually &quot;So was that pretty fun?  Should we do that again sometime?&quot;  Of<br/>\n&gt; course, DS answered, &quot;No, it sucked!&quot;  AHHH!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It really bothers me when he thinks his life sucks, because it makes me feel<br/>\n&gt; like I&#39;m doing something wrong.  It was actually one of the clues that led<br/>\n&gt; me to unschooling in the first place, because I took it as a sign that what<br/>\n&gt; we were doing wasn&#39;t working.  It&#39;s not like we were a spanking,<br/>\n&gt; inconsiderate family before unschooling.  We did use occasional time outs or<br/>\n&gt; taking away of privileges.  But generally, I&#39;ve always considered myself an<br/>\n&gt; AP parent.  We&#39;ve always had pretty open communication.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just don&#39;t know what to do.  I feel like the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach would<br/>\n&gt; be to embrace him for who he is.  But OTOH, I feel like pessimism isn&#39;t who<br/>\n&gt; someone is, it&#39;s a clue that someone is not truly happy with themselves or<br/>\n&gt; with their place in the world.  How do I help him feel better about<br/>\n&gt; himself?  Could our brief encounter with punishment and bedtime/food<br/>\n&gt; limitations really be the cause of all this negative energy?

He<br/>\nseems very grumpy all the time and has taken on a sort of pessimist attitude<br/>\nabout the world.  For example, today DS did not want to go swimming.  He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have an option to stay home, because DD (4) was looking forward to<br/>\ngoing and we were meeting friends there.  There was no one to watch DS while<br/>\nwe went.  I told him he did not have to swim, or even get his bathing suit<br/>\non, but he did have to go, because there were no other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the car, he told me that he wished I would kill him, so he could start<br/>\nhis life over.  We talked about how horrible his life was, because he &quot;never<br/>\ngets to do anything fun,&quot; and he&#39;s &quot;ugly, because his head is shaped funny&quot;<br/>\n(it&#39;s not).  I tried to sympathize with him and find out why he thought<br/>\nthese things, but he just said, &quot;It&#39;s just how I feel.&quot;  I asked him what<br/>\nsort of things he would consider fun (he listed things we already do a<br/>\nlot).  He grumbled the whole way to the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got there, DS happily put on his bathing suit, with no mention of<br/>\nthe feelings he had in the car ride.  He swam and had a blast.  We ended up<br/>\nstaying there for 4 hours!  When we got in the car, I asked both kids,<br/>\ncasually &quot;So was that pretty fun?  Should we do that again sometime?&quot;  Of<br/>\ncourse, DS answered, &quot;No, it sucked!&quot;  AHHH!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really bothers me when he thinks his life sucks, because it makes me feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;m doing something wrong.  It was actually one of the clues that led<br/>\nme to unschooling in the first place, because I took it as a sign that what<br/>\nwe were doing wasn&#39;t working.  It&#39;s not like we were a spanking,<br/>\ninconsiderate family before unschooling.  We did use occasional time outs or<br/>\ntaking away of privileges.  But generally, I&#39;ve always considered myself an<br/>\nAP parent.  We&#39;ve always had pretty open communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t know what to do.  I feel like the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach would<br/>\nbe to embrace him for who he is.  But OTOH, I feel like pessimism isn&#39;t who<br/>\nsomeone is, it&#39;s a clue that someone is not truly happy with themselves or<br/>\nwith their place in the world.  How do I help him feel better about<br/>\nhimself?  Could our brief encounter with punishment and bedtime/food<br/>\nlimitations really be the cause of all this negative energy?  Will it go<br/>\naway as we get more into the unschooling mindset?<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34665,"nextTopicId":34645}}
