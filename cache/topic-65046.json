I&#39;m Tara and live with my husband, 11 year old daughter and almost 15 year old son. We&#39;re notorious flip floppers when it comes to unschooling; but, my husband and I are committed to trying until we get there! I wish I had reached out sooner for advice as I really enjoy reading the list and  the reccomended sites....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am divorced from my eldest&#39;s father. We were married young and divorced young. We were only together until our son was 18 mos, but we&#39;ve co parented in the same city for most of the ensuing years, with me taking on the bulk of the day to day parenting and decision making. I started homeschooling our son after kindergarten. His dad was never really on board with it and while he wasn&#39;t openly negative, kids sense these things and a few comments, snide remarks and dinner time spelling tests really do have quite an impact. My son feels that homeschooling might have been a mistake and that he &quot;just wants to be normal.&quot; He has and does struggle with the mixed messages he has received both from me, his step-dad and his dad. My son decided to attend 9th grade this year and has been attending a very small public alternative school. He doesn&#39;t like it and has decided to move into his dad&#39;s house and attend the local, much larger high school there. He&#39;ll be in the same city and living at my house most weekends. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could list the million things I wish I had done differently; but, mostly I&#39;d love some advice on how to move forward, things to think about and what to avoid. My husband and I are starting the deschooling process (again) with our daughter, who has always been homeschooled. I have a tendency to get anxious if she isn&#39;t &quot;doing something&quot; and we&#39;ve gone back and forth so many times between &quot;doing school&quot; and trying unschooling that we are in a bit of a muddle! Also, how do I support my son&#39;s schooling but avoid getting angsty about grades and homework? I have a hard time not making him do his homework or trying to talk to him about his grades. Anyone been through this? I think we&#39;ve been trying to keep a foot in both camps for a long time (especially my son, who has to live in both camps) and it hasn&#39;t served us at all.
