My daughter&#39;s neighbour was over when I <br/>\nwas visiting yesterday.  She was delighted to tell my daughter that her <br/>\ndaughter was learning her alphabet.  This little girl, who is about 17 <br/>\nmonths old is being taught to repeat the letters after her mother.  She <br/>\nhasn&#39;t got a clue what it all means, but her mother thinks she&#39;s learning <br/>\nher alphabet.  My grandson, at just about 16 months, isn&#39;t the least bit <br/>\ninterested in the alphabet, though he&#39;s crazy about books.  If he asked <br/>\nHeather what the letters were, she&#39;d happily tell him.  Otherwise, it just <br/>\nisn&#39;t an issue.  Now I know that lots of people who end up sending their <br/>\nkids to school would have the same attitude when their kids are that <br/>\nlittle, but isn&#39;t my daughter unschooling Kaelin?  Does it make a <br/>\ndifference that she&#39;s also unschooling Skye, age 7?   I&#39;ve always told <br/>\npeople who were worried that they wouldn&#39;t be able to do a good job of <br/>\nhomeschooling that they&#39;ve been doing it since their child was born.  I <br/>\nthink that if they&#39;ve also been letting their child make any educational <br/>\ndecisions during those &quot;preschool&quot; years, then they&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>\nsince birth.  Obviously they aren&#39;t experienced unschoolers in the sense <br/>\nthat people with older kids are, but I don&#39;t agree that they aren&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I did not say it was all equal.

I can&#39;t be the most experienced in every aspect of life,<br/>\nunschooling or otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am doing some research (casual, for my own enjoyment) about Navy SEALs. I<br/>\nam learning things about them from a variety of sources. One of those<br/>\nsources is an ex-SEAL. There is no way, no matter how much I study and how<br/>\nmany facts I can produce, that I can get his kind of experience. If someone<br/>\nwanted to know about BUD/S, and he and I and an Admiral who had not been a<br/>\nSEAL were all in the same room, Admiral So-and-So and I could, with probably<br/>\nvarying degrees of expertise, tell the person that BUD/S means Basic<br/>\nUnderwater Demolition/Swimming and is the training course that wannabe SEALs<br/>\ngo through, and what it entails.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly the SEAL could tell them what it felt like to be on day 7 of Hell Week<br/>\nwith four total hours of sleep for the week under his belt, soaking wet for<br/>\nthe 7th day running, with most of his class having quit already. Only he<br/>\nwould know what it was really like to really live through that. Only he<br/>\nwould know and might be able to communicate what it was in him that brought<br/>\nhim through, and what he learned from it at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am talking to a dog trainer who has trained only one Golden Retriever<br/>\nthus far in her career, and she is about to train her first Pit Bull, she<br/>\nwill be able to tell me, from her reading and her observation, some things<br/>\nthat she has learned about training dogs in general and maybe some things<br/>\nshe&#39;s read or observed others doing with Pit Bulls in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she and I were standing in a room of dog owners and she knew that for the<br/>\npast five years I had worked with an animal rescue group specializing in Pit<br/>\nBull rescue and rehabilitation, who would it make the most sense for a new<br/>\nPit Bull owner to listen to?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that things like support groups and this list and Le Leche League<br/>\nand classes and training courses and conversations with mentors exist are<br/>\nbecause there is no substitute for experience and living through specific<br/>\nstages of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been through my 20s. I&#39;ve argued, passionately and with full sincerity,<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re arguing. And I didn&#39;t believe my 30s would make any difference,<br/>\neither. So I know none of this helps you now, but later, when you&#39;re feeling<br/>\ndifferent and might not quite know why, it might help you.

Their<br/>\nexperiences as parents have been very different, even<br/>\nif they were unschooling the whole time.  What would I<br/>\njudge their wisdom on?  The number of years?

My point was, and is,<br/>\nand seems to have been missed and equated to mean<br/>\nother things, that experience does not equal wisdom. <br/>\nThat youngness does not equal niaveness.

But when you are <br/>\ntaking flak for not putting your child in school, answering concerned <br/>\nrelatives questions, trying to conform to state laws and still adhere to your <br/>\nunschooling beliefs etc....THAT is where experience plays a huge part.<br/>\nNo one questions why a toddler would be home with you. It&#39;s a whole different <br/>\nball of wax, YK?<br/>\nThe arguements posed in defense of  different experiences/different wisdom <br/>\nare missing the point! I think that is one of the biggest differences in my <br/>\n30&#39;s...that I EXPECT to understand things deeper and with more experience in <br/>\nmy 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s and beyond. I also respect the wisdom of many elders I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave before. Most people in their 90&#39;s have a lot to teach me. Even if their <br/>\nviews don&#39;t strictly adhere to mine. Then let&#39;s take the people who ARE very <br/>\nthoughtful, and have similar views. It would be silly to say &quot;oh, they just <br/>\nhave a different experience, my wisdom is equally as valuable&quot;. NO, it&#39;s not <br/>\nin every case because (let&#39;s use Sandra here since I know she&#39;s older than <br/>\nme) Sandra has lived life as a young mother, as a 35y,o. and an unschooler <br/>\nand I haven&#39;t yet!!
