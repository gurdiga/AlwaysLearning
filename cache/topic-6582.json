The show turned out to be more about the difficulties involved for modern females trying to cope without make-up and shampoo on the frontier.  Really.  I don&#39;t know why the Malibu, California family signed up for the experience when the two fifteen year old teenagers and the mom were so obviously upset about their appearance sans make-up and blow-dryer.  But anyway, I was surprised to find so many posts to our local homeschool support group list about how disappointing the show was.  Many decided against allowing their children to view the show due to the lack of educational value.<br/>\n<br/>\n Previously I would have also been disappointed at the lack of historical information to be found in this show.  But without even trying, I discovered I found value in the show, because it provided an opportunity for at least three members of my family to spend enjoyable time together.  We had a lot to comment on anyway, such as the values these girls had learned, teamwork, snow in June, and more.  But even if there were no comments, and only enjoyable time together as a family, that would have been enough for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first made the big switch to unschooling two months ago, I put away all the school texts and workbooks, but I pulled out the other stuff:  Family Math, Math for Smartypants, books of science experiments, computer games, etc.. We&#39;ve rented lots of movies, spent time playing Monopoly and Yahtzee.  But the movies were The Ten Commandments and Cleopatra, and the games are obviously math oriented. I thought replacing the boring stuff with the more fun stuff, in addition to giving choices and opportunities to say no, would mean I was unschooling, agenda or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reactions to the educational value of show last night made clear to me my philosophy of unschooling is changing.  These are my new thoughts:  I can have absolutely no agenda, not even think about anything academic at all, but just remain supportive and participatory in my kids&#39; lives by doing things for no other reason than to have fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I&#39;m doubting my judgment.
