When Devin lived here(working  construction) and made <br/>\nway more than I do (after the divorce and all that),  I felt he could help pay <br/>\nfor the food he was eating.  Yes, I had been  paying before he was 18, but I <br/>\nwas often down to my last actual few dollars, and  needed the money.  I could <br/>\nsee that after they were older, and contributing  to the costs of the house <br/>\nthey seemed to take more responsibilty for wasting  less, and being more aware.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy giving the kids a personal and clothing allowance usually they had more  <br/>\nspending money than I have.  But I didn&#39;t want to change that after the  <br/>\ndivorce, because it would be one more important thing that got changed.  We  decided <br/>\nto end it at 18, because we were trying to be &quot;fair&quot; to each of the five  <br/>\nkids.  Of the four that are over 18, they have all been extremely able in  the <br/>\nhandling of their life decisions and in their money stuff.  It has  worked well <br/>\nin our family.  If I had more money, would I give them more as  they are older <br/>\n- you betcha&#39;!  I hope I get to that point.  But they  understand now that <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to establish a life where I won&#39;t be on the  street myself in my <br/>\n&quot;old&quot; age. <br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23595,"nextTopicId":23617}}
