Hiring  a sitter is too pricey for us with our <br/>\nfinances and the four girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal with our sleeping arrangement is this: I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s <br/>\never okay to not answer a child&#39;s cry at night, and I believe in <br/>\nco-sleeping with babies...and I have four children.  So by the time I <br/>\nhad Leiren, the forth, I was bed-hopping so much at night, with the <br/>\nbaby, that I would wake up and not know where I was, plus dh would get <br/>\nwoken up every time in jumped in or out of our bed.  He&#39;s a farmer and <br/>\ndesperately needs good sleep or he could get hurt at work.  We put a <br/>\nfull-size bed in our library for when my grandmother came to visit and <br/>\nit was still here, so the girls and I just started sleeping there.  It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen awesome!  They&#39;re comfortable going to sleep when they&#39;re tired and <br/>\nthey&#39;re not scared of being alone, because I&#39;m downstairs with them and <br/>\nwhenever they wake up (anytime 9-12) they wake up right next to all the <br/>\nactivity, they just join in.  One of the best parts is since we started, <br/>\nI now get to sleep ALL night, and for the first time in 7 years feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m getting enough rest.  I&#39;ve been able to cut way back on my <br/>\ncoffee.  Technically, I wasn&#39;t really sleeping in the bed with dh <br/>\nbefore, and all of our nights were disruptive.  Now it&#39;s just a lot <br/>\nbetter :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave the Happiest of Holidays!<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:javamdnss@...\">javamdnss@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hello Heidi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can relate to your posts, since my husband and I just argued about this <br/>\n&gt;this past weekend.
