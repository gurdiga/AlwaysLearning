I sometimes  browse freebie <br/>\nboards (for anyone who is unfamiliar, these are blogs/boards  where people post <br/>\nlinks to free samples of products, etc.)  Anyhoo, there  was a freebie listing <br/>\nrecently for a bumper sticker that read &quot;Please Don&#39;t  Spank.&quot;  I&#39;ll have you <br/>\nknow that there were pages and pages on this blog  about all of the spoiled, <br/>\nrotten children that would be running around if people  listened to this <br/>\nadvice.  People actually got so hostile that they were  angry with the original <br/>\nposter for even listing the item.  All these moms  could talk about was how proud <br/>\nthey were that they spanked their kids.   Sad.  And you know, the kids <br/>\nprobably think very little of it.  I was  regularly spanked as a child.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeaten, and I truly believe that my  parents&#39; intention was to raise me right.  I <br/>\nthink that they did what they  thought parents should do for the welfare of <br/>\ntheir children.  I can&#39;t  recall the number of times that my father said that <br/>\nif he didn&#39;t love me, he  would never spank me, because he wouldn&#39;t care what I <br/>\ndid.  Spanking was a  sign of love in their minds.  Sigh.  I actually <br/>\nbelieved that as a  child.  I hated spankings, but understood them to be a loving  <br/>\ngesture.  What a crock!!!  I am so glad that I have chosen to follow  my <br/>\ninstincts and show my son &quot;love&quot; by &quot;loving&quot; him, not hitting him.  It&#39;s  really <br/>\ngreat to be able to connect with like-minded parents who put their  children <br/>\nfirst, who aren&#39;t afraid to challenge conventional thinking.
