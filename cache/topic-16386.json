It looks to me like this <br/>\nhomeschooltravelnetwork is just acting as a travel agent.

If you aren&#39;t sure at this point if you can go, we have until <br/>\nMarch 1 before we lose the cabins. However, you&#39;ll have to pay in full at <br/>\nthat point and all the rooms may be booked by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nGinger has reserved several different cabin styles. Some are ocean views, <br/>\nsome are inside cabins. If you do not want a balcony, just indicate that on <br/>\nyour reservation form. She said that they are standard size cabins. Of <br/>\ncourse, they have larger cabins available at a higher cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some people that may have 5 family members. Unfortunately, <br/>\nNorwegian is pretty strict about their 4 in a room policy. However, some <br/>\npeople may want to make arrangements with other families that have 5 or 6 to <br/>\nshare an additional cabin. Ginger can get adjoining cabins in these cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the website is homeschooltravelnetwork.com and our cruise is the one <br/>\nleaving from Houston. You may also call Ginger at 404-642-7512 if you have <br/>\nspecific questions.
