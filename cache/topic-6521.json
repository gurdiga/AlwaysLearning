John explained that he didn&#39;t mind answering questions <br/>\nthat were asked when the person truly wanted the information.  He gave the <br/>\nexample of being stopped while walking on the street, and someone is lost, <br/>\nand wanting instructions.  He said when someone truly wants to know more <br/>\nabout un/homeschooling he didn&#39;t mind answering their questions no matter how <br/>\noften he has offered that particular information.  BUT, when they are asking <br/>\nquestions to try to put it down, or make fun of what you are doing, he simply <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t answer the questions.  He called those &quot;hippopotamus questions&quot;.  <br/>\nThat has helped me clarify when I do and don&#39;t respond  to be questioned <br/>\n(even when it&#39;s my Mother asking those questions!  Or, maybe especially when <br/>\nit&#39;s my Mother!).<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6513,"nextTopicId":6535}}
