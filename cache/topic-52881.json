They were likely to be banished<br/>\nto the car until the playtime was over if they didn&#39;t &quot;get along&quot; as though<br/>\n&quot;get along&quot; was a simple command to be followed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure why people expect children to just listen to verbal<br/>\ndirections/commands etc. I think it&#39;s an unconscious expression (I<br/>\nhope it&#39;s unconscious) of how inconvenienced they feel by children. As<br/>\nif programming children with the right set(s) of commands would bring<br/>\nabout the desired behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think most people realize how it is for the children.<br/>\nKnowledge of a command is not the same as understanding what it means.<br/>\nMany people think that language is understanding, that words are<br/>\nenough. It takes more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on top of that, top-down directions, guidance and commands leave<br/>\nout other factors that play an important part in all this: what the<br/>\nchild wants. Communication is not a one-way street. The thing I want<br/>\nto convey is that what Karl feels matters to me, not to tell him what<br/>\nhe &quot;should&quot; be or what he &quot;should&quot; do. I want to continue talking on<br/>\nthe side (not in front of others or to embarrass him surely) about how<br/>\nothers in the situation might be feeling. I want him to get the idea,<br/>\nover time, that people count. And that includes him. Without<br/>\nconsidering what&#39;s going on with children, it&#39;s probably impossible to<br/>\nget those kinds of things across. We can say the words all day long<br/>\nand it won&#39;t mean what we want it to without the accompanying behavior<br/>\nfrom ourselves to match the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowledge of words â‰  Understanding of ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52880,"nextTopicId":52755}}
