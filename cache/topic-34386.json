One day, when my son was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>two,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had come home from work and I was playing with him, helping him<br/>\n&gt; build with his Brio, and he deliberately smacked me in the mouth <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one of the wooden blocks and broke two teeth.

For somebody who thinks of himself as a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;successful parent&#39; (which I am), these events are a challenge. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was an exceptional event though. Mostly the tantrums and acts <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; aggression were of the usual kind for a toddler (if that makes <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sense).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When my son started school, however, what had been occasional <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tantrums<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and outbursts escalated over time into almost chronic rage.

During those<br/>\n&gt; &#39;dark and desperate&#39; weeks, I used to pick my son up from the<br/>\n&gt; classroom and, on the ten minute walk home, he would almost always<br/>\n&gt; pick a fight with me out of nothing and would either sit down on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ground and refuse to budge or I would get punched and kicked and<br/>\n&gt; occasionally whacked with a conveniently available tree branch. One<br/>\n&gt; time, he threw a house brick at my head. It&#39;s okay, I ducked. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, we got through it. Within weeks of my son leaving school, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tantrums and apparently random acts of aggression had vanished like<br/>\n&gt; morning mist in the sunshine.

But after <br/>\nreading Bob&#39;s response I could see parallels in my life. Our 4yo son <br/>\nseems to be very aggressive toward my husband a lot of the time. He <br/>\nhas wacked him in the face with a plastic golf club. He sometimes <br/>\npunches my husband as hard as he can for no apparent reason. It was <br/>\nvery bizarre behavior for our 4yo. OTOH, my husband was gone from <br/>\njust before he turned 3 until just after he turned 4, an entire year <br/>\nof his life without a male role model. It was like my husband came <br/>\nback and the testosterone went wild. Our son would never do those <br/>\nthings with me, although he could have. He still has never done <br/>\nanything like that with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur son is now calming down a bit. He doesn&#39;t beat the crap out of <br/>\ndaddy so much anymore.

Who knows?<br/>\nI&#39;m not a mind reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn truth, there were other factors involved besides the school<br/>\nexperience. My son had been in childcare for bits and pieces of his<br/>\ntoddlerhood (until I quit my job to be at home with him full time when<br/>\nhe was two and a half), with the result that his life in those early<br/>\nyears had been quite fragmented at times - he usually didn&#39;t know when<br/>\nhe would be at home, when he would be elsewhere, and who he would be<br/>\nwith. We moved house five times from his birth until we bought the<br/>\nhouse we&#39;re living in now when he was five years old, including<br/>\nemigrating from England to Australia. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile all that was going on, there were occasional tantrums and acts<br/>\nof aggression to accommodate somehow whenever he became frustrated<br/>\nwith his less than ideal circumstances. One day, when my son was two,<br/>\nI had come home from work and I was playing with him, helping him<br/>\nbuild with his Brio, and he deliberately smacked me in the mouth with<br/>\none of the wooden blocks and broke two teeth. And while I&#39;m rolling on<br/>\nthe floor in pain with little bits of my shattered teeth around me, my<br/>\nwife&#39;s saying &quot;What did you do to upset him?&quot; LOL. I still laugh about<br/>\nthat when I think of it. For somebody who thinks of himself as a<br/>\n&#39;successful parent&#39; (which I am), these events are a challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was an exceptional event though. Mostly the tantrums and acts of<br/>\naggression were of the usual kind for a toddler (if that makes sense).<br/>\nWhen my son started school, however, what had been occasional tantrums<br/>\nand outbursts escalated over time into almost chronic rage. After my<br/>\nwife and I had decided he would be homeschooled, we made the HUGE<br/>\nmistake of agreeing with the school that he would complete the year<br/>\n(there were only seven weeks remaining when we made the decision - I<br/>\nwould have taken him out immediately in retrospect). During those<br/>\n&#39;dark and desperate&#39; weeks, I used to pick my son up from the<br/>\nclassroom and, on the ten minute walk home, he would almost always<br/>\npick a fight with me out of nothing and would either sit down on the<br/>\nground and refuse to budge or I would get punched and kicked and<br/>\noccasionally whacked with a conveniently available tree branch. One<br/>\ntime, he threw a house brick at my head. It&#39;s okay, I ducked. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we got through it. Within weeks of my son leaving school, his<br/>\ntantrums and apparently random acts of aggression had vanished like<br/>\nmorning mist in the sunshine. It took another couple of years for us<br/>\nto become as close as I would like to have always been with him - we<br/>\nhadn&#39;t exactly got off to a great start with that: we&#39;d spent hardly<br/>\nany meaningful time together in the first two and a half years of his<br/>\nlife because I&#39;d had a &#39;real job&#39; in those days that kept me away from<br/>\nhome 60 hours a week. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my son was out of school, my wife and I were able to give him<br/>\nsomething he&#39;d never really known before - at least to the extent that<br/>\nhe could trust in it - maximum control over his own life. Once, that<br/>\nis, we&#39;d dumped the &#39;school at home&#39; trial that lasted all of two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen truly helpful circumstances eventuated (not circumstances we only<br/>\nthought were helpful), my son became positive and friendly very<br/>\nquickly. He was always a genuinely wonderful person. And behaved<br/>\naccordingly most of the time. Now there were no hindrances to him<br/>\nbeing wonderful all the time - as he&#39;s continued to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I learned from my own experience:<br/>\n<br/>\nSet the goal of solving the problem (Don&#39;t, for example, ask yourself<br/>\nquestions like &quot;What if nothing works?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nHave faith in your ability to find a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow the answer to these two questions. What do I want? How will I<br/>\nknow I&#39;ve got it?<br/>\n<br/>\nBe the change you want to see in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can feel compassion for my son and be even more determined to<br/>\ncreate circumstances that will make it easy for him to be happy when<br/>\nhe&#39;s just thrown a house brick at my head ... well, you get the point<br/>\nof what Ghandi said, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have to go upstream to find your solution in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ten cents worth anyway. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333194003,"authorName":"Kim Musolff","from":"&quot;Kim Musolff&quot; &lt;kmoose75@...&gt;","profile":"kimmusolff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"What if nothing works?","postDate":"1208575416","msgId":34386,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MTgyMDIzeTJmZTg3OTJzNmFjZmM1YjgxZjkwNTIzYUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34404,"prevInTime":34385,"nextInTime":34387,"topicId":34386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone emailed me, and asked if I could post this anonymously.

Dh turn to go in (he was mad) and our son picked up a handful of<br/>\ndirt and threw it in DH&#39; hair! Dh was livid!

Our son<br/>\nis still running from him when they go to the playground,store,etc.<br/>\nOur son is 6yo.<br/>\n this is just one example of many incidents between my son and my<br/>\nhusband.
