But his enjoyment of <br/>\ntelevision and DVDs will probably also never go away (unless we are using a <br/>\ngeologic time frame).

You can find some toys he&#39;s always liked or coloring books <br/>\nand put them where he is so that he can choose to muli-task if he so <br/>\ndesires. This is his passion at this moment.

However Jayn is so<br/>\nhugely busy all the time while watching, and so clearly &quot;cross-pollinating&quot;<br/>\nwhat she sees and hears from tv into her other games. There were times when<br/>\nshe would watch the same thing over and over and over without respite when<br/>\nyounger, but she never had to fear that the tv would be off if she left the<br/>\nroom for a moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, as I now recall, she insisted that her program stay on if she<br/>\nstepped out, so that she could come back to it at will, until with maturity<br/>\nshe started to understand the dvd/tivo technology and concept of &quot;pause&quot;<br/>\nbetter. That let her relax a lot more. It seemed like her true internal<br/>\ncognizance of what &quot;pausing a program&quot; meant to her freedom to do other<br/>\nstuff came later than the superficial intellectual knowledge of it. Does<br/>\nthat make sense? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the better question is &quot;how can mom accomplish the things that are<br/>\nimportant to her while still supporting son&#39;s desire to watch with<br/>\nconcentration&quot;? If you really can&#39;t let go of the idea that pajamas are<br/>\nessential for sleep (Jayn wears hers like clothes a lot of the time) maybe<br/>\nhelping him slip them on during the closing credits, or during a less<br/>\ncrucial montage earlier would help you relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he isn&#39;t eating the food you are bringing, maybe it is the wrong food. Is<br/>\nit really easy to eat finger food, or does it require his attention to work<br/>\nspoons and not drip? Is it what he really likes? My dd&#39;s preferences change<br/>\na lot. Is it stuff that can safely sit for a while and still be appetizing?<br/>\nWhat about something other than water to drink, with some more nutrition in<br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have found that trying to control Jayn&#39;s tooth brushing results in less<br/>\ntooth brushing. Maybe if you announce that you are going to do yours, and<br/>\ninvite him to do his again during the credits, between shows or at some time<br/>\nthat is easy to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn likes the dolls, toys, books and activities that refer to her favorite<br/>\nshows. In the absence of dolls of characters from movies Jayn plans on<br/>\nmodifying Barbies or other dolls to be those characters. Recently, for<br/>\nexample, I sewed dresses for one of her fashion dolls in the style of &quot;Room<br/>\nWith a View&quot; (early 1900&#39;s). Maybe he would feel really supported if he was<br/>\ngiven an action figure, doll, picture book, whatever that referred to his<br/>\nfavorite program. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn is focused and I need her to hear me, I put my hand on her<br/>\nshoulder. I also ask her what she heard me say, especially if it is<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he is escaping from his real life to fantasy at the moment, perhaps<br/>\nbecause of the new baby intruder. Even if this is the case being acceptant<br/>\nof that need, painful as it may be to mom, can only be better than fighting<br/>\nit which won&#39;t make it go away any quicker.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

He doesn&#39;t hear me when I speak to him. He is totally focused<br/>\non the DVD.<br/>\n- he doesn&#39;t play and do other things while watching. It looks as if<br/>\nsome children do but my son doesn&#39;t multi-task in front of the DVD.<br/>\nSomeone said not believing a child could watch 3 films in a row - my<br/>\nson will watch the same film again and again, as I said, studying it,<br/>\nlearning it by heart.<br/>\n- Don&#39;t I sit and watch with him - yes, but not all afternoon.<br/>\n- why haven&#39;t I mentioned any of the shows he loves - yes, I did,<br/>\nHairy McLairy, perhaps not familiar to you in the US?<br/>\n<br/>\n- I see the points being made about mother&#39;s resentment of a child&#39;s<br/>\npleasure/attention-seeking/ etc. These are all useful reminders, thank<br/>\nyou Sandra.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Any thoughts on the physical effects of watching lots of TV? I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking - posture, eyesight, exposure to electrical field, lack of<br/>\nexercise/fresh air.

It was an interesting experiment as we<br/>\n&gt;  ourselves had never been without TV and I noticed (a) that TV eats<br/>\n&gt;  time, which I no longer have in vast quantities as I did before having<br/>\n&gt;  children and (b) I missed surprisingly little of it... in fact I felt<br/>\n&gt;  relieved at no longer being tempted to watch trash.<br/>\n&gt;  Then my huband, suffering film withdrawal symptoms, bought a DVD<br/>\n&gt;  player meant just for the 2 of us.<br/>\n&gt;  A few months ago he showed it to my now 4-year old.<br/>\n&gt;  So the DVD player is now my son&#39;s favourite toy. He wakes up in the<br/>\n&gt;  morning, and asks to watch a DVD. He comes home after an outing, and<br/>\n&gt;  asks for it again. He won&#39;t eat, drink or do anything but watch. This<br/>\n&gt;  is worring because he is already a pretty thin boy.<br/>\n&gt;  He watches the same thing over and over again, studying it. OK, so<br/>\n&gt;  he&#39;s learning Hairy Mclairy off by heart and yes, having dipped into<br/>\n&gt;  your ideas, Sandra, though I admit I haven&#39;t had time to read your<br/>\n&gt;  work properly, we&#39;ve let him watch as unrestricted as we dare because<br/>\n&gt;  who are we to say what he is and isn&#39;t getting from it?<br/>\n&gt;  But it feels a bit like having offered my lovely boy an open Pandora&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  box. Yesterday I cracked a bit, which I regret. (I guess I did an<br/>\n&gt;  impersonation of my own mother falling apart, although I didn&#39;t go as<br/>\n&gt;  far as to shove a sponge in his hand with instructions to do something<br/>\n&gt;  useful and wash the car, but perhaps that&#39;s because I don&#39;t have a <br/>\n&gt; car.)<br/>\n&gt;  I do need some advice from you about what you think is going to happen<br/>\n&gt;  to this obsessive viewing. He is only 4. I feel I am losing my son to<br/>\n&gt;  the screen. We used to play games together, but he&#39;s lost interest.<br/>\n&gt;  And don&#39;t say, &#39;he&#39;ll lose interest in what he&#39;s watching and want to<br/>\n&gt;  reconnect with you&#39;because he&#39;s smart enough to know there are lots<br/>\n&gt;  more DVDs in the library full of new interest. Each new DVD brings<br/>\n&gt;  about an 8-hour daily viewing schedule.<br/>\n&gt;  I am also worried about the effect on me. I&#39;m getting used to not<br/>\n&gt;  bothering looking after him any more.<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;s going to regulate himself. Or at least, not to<br/>\n&gt;  anything less than hours a day.<br/>\n&gt;  And the other worry I have is that he prefers a life in front a screen<br/>\n&gt;  now than he does his life outdoors and interacting with his family.<br/>\n&gt;  Sorry if I sound grumpy. I&#39;m probably just a bit scared.

She likes to watch a lot of different things, but is<br/>\nconstantly in motion and playing games while it is on.  If she&#39;s<br/>\nreally into something, and would rather watch it than go out, we <br/>\nbring the portable DVD player with us so she can finish up in the car<br/>\non the way.  By the time we get up to the car and buckled in, she&#39;s<br/>\nusually forgotten or is not interested anymore.  But she has the<br/>\noption. We&#39;ve started so many adventures with something gleaned from<br/>\nwatching tv together.  The discovery of falcons and getting to meet<br/>\none live came from a Stuart Little movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had big tv restrictions as a kid.  If I wanted to watch a show, I<br/>\nhad to have it pre-approved.  If it was approved, I had to give a<br/>\nreport on it afterwards.  So basically I snuck tv to avoid this.  I<br/>\nprobably should have all sorts of issues around tv but amazingly I<br/>\ndon&#39;t. Yay!  As a kid, I read a lot, but even that was restricted by<br/>\nimposed bedtimes and school, which seriously got in the way.  My<br/>\nissues seem to be centered around that restriction - If I like what<br/>\nI&#39;m reading I can&#39;t put it down, as though I&#39;m afraid it will<br/>\ndisappear and I won&#39;t get a second chance to get to the end.  Yes, I<br/>\nhave MAJOR self-regulation issues regarding books.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had absolutely no restrictions whatsoever regarding<br/>\ntelevision or movies in his family.  He has a very strong desire to<br/>\nwatch television/movies and read books undistracted, but is super fun<br/>\nto be around because he can quote from pretty much any movie ever<br/>\nmade. Like someone who has studied the Bible and has some scripture to<br/>\nback up whatever he says. He has always listened to music a lot, too,<br/>\nthe same albums over and over.  He can sing songs he&#39;s heard just<br/>\nonce, pitch perfect without any musical training.  Someone<br/>\nmentioned Christopher Lee, yep well DH has been reading The<br/>\nSilmarillion at least once a year as long as I&#39;ve known him, probably<br/>\nlonger.  It really makes him happy.  He spends a lot of time staring<br/>\nat strange holes in the ground and collects bits of rust.  If I only<br/>\nsaw that aspect of him I&#39;d think he might need psychological help. <br/>\nBut he&#39;s gathering information for the amazing art he makes. He loves<br/>\nto play video games, which he claims give him a better sense of<br/>\ndirection.  (My thumbs hurt too much when I try to play so I don&#39;t,<br/>\nand I have a terrible sense of direction.) He plays with legos a lot,<br/>\neven as an adult, and claims that is why he took to Apple&#39;s GarageBand<br/>\nsoftware so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the motion to sit down with your son and watch what he&#39;s<br/>\nwatching.  Talk about it.  See what interests him.  Make some<br/>\nconnections in the world from what he is watching.

Occasionally a mom will have a little fit of petulance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes moms say &quot;He prefers [something] to being with *moi*!&quot; and  <br/>\nit can be an indicator of one or more things people have &#39;fessed up  <br/>\nto in the past or that I&#39;ve felt myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n--The mom is remembering childhood &quot;NO&quot; and other shaming from her  <br/>\nown life, and feeling the urge to channel that.<br/>\n--The mom is avoiding feeling a little guilty because she hasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthought of anything really cool to do for a while.<br/>\n--The mom is feeling that unschooling might be a little harder than  <br/>\nshe&#39;d thought, and she really WILL have to be fun.<br/>\n--The mom had a fantasy of how the child would be, and the child is  <br/>\nRUDELY not reading her mind and complying.<br/>\n--The mom is emotional about something altogether different and is in  <br/>\ndanger of taking it out on an innocent child.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle kids might not see &quot;going outdoors&quot; as a goal in and of  <br/>\nitself.  They don&#39;t have the voices of grandmothers in them saying  <br/>\n&quot;Get some fresh air,&quot; or whatever, and that&#39;s probably good.  If  <br/>\nthere&#39;s something very cool happening outside, they might want to go  <br/>\nout for the cool thing, but not just for the sake of the outside.   <br/>\nSometimes moms have checklists and will feel like a better mom if the  <br/>\nkid&#39;s &quot;had recess&quot; or maybe the mom is thinking &quot;PE&quot; (&quot;physical  <br/>\neducation,&quot; which was once a big deal in American schools, and now  <br/>\nless so).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in there the mom&#39;s voices and visions are coming between  <br/>\nher and her child&#39;s immediate interests and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF a mom tries to lure a child away from the TV just to do it, that  <br/>\ncan be good or bad.  If a refusal is going to make her feel rejected  <br/>\nand angry, that&#39;s probably more about the mom&#39;s neediness than the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s.  If the mom wants to play outside and can make it aluring  <br/>\nand fun, that&#39;s a great idea, unless the mom plans it to interrupt a  <br/>\nchild&#39;s favorite show, and will sulk and complain if the answer&#39;s  <br/>\nno.    If the mom plans a really fantastic thing out of the house,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s really fantastic!  Ice skating, a movie, an amusement park,  <br/>\nswimming!  But if the plan is about separating the child from a  <br/>\nfavorite show, and not about ice skating, movies, rides or swimming,  <br/>\nthen it&#39;s not fantastic, it&#39;s mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffer to record the favorite show, if you want to do something else.   <br/>\nSometimes the child won&#39;t even watch the recording, but you&#39;ve given  <br/>\nhim flexibility and respect.   Flexibility and respect are way better  <br/>\nthan &quot;outside&quot; for the sake of checklisting &quot;he went outside today.&quot;   <br/>\nAnd with flexibility and respect, you&#39;ll get more &quot;outside&quot; and more  <br/>\nhappiness and joy than if you scheduled &quot;outside,&quot; and controlled the  <br/>\nTV, because you can&#39;t schedule or control happiness or joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can work on your own happiness and joy, though. And moms who are  <br/>\nshort in that department shouldn&#39;t depend on their children to  <br/>\nprovide it. Some moms seem to act like if they&#39;re unhappy it&#39;s their  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s fault.   If you have the least smidgen of that feeling,  <br/>\nwork to undo it.

I am  <br/>\nashamed to say that I went through a period of extreme TV  <br/>\nsnobbishness. I felt that watching television was a waste of our  <br/>\ntime, so I got rid of cable. We only watched carefully chosen videos,  <br/>\ndesigned to enrich and uplift us. (I cringe as I write this now!) I  <br/>\nwas totally obnoxious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day Colton and Bud returned from the library, thrilled with what  <br/>\nthey had found. A video copy of &quot;Godzilla!&quot; I snorted derisively and  <br/>\nsuggested that our time would be better spent with a book. I was  <br/>\nignored. They made some popcorn and started the movie. I sat with  <br/>\nthem on the couch, or to be more accurate, on my moral high horse,  <br/>\nwith an &quot;uplifting&quot; book in hand. I rolled my eyes and sighed with  <br/>\ngusto to point out how they were wasting their time. Colton and Bud  <br/>\ncontinued to ignore me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething finally penetrated my self-imposed role as the chief of the  <br/>\nculture police. A voice whispered in my ear: Look at them, Carol.  <br/>\nJust LOOK at them! I studied my son and my husband for about five  <br/>\nminutes. They were totally engrossed in the movie, yet they never  <br/>\nstopped touching each other. Colton would lean against Bud&#39;s shoulder  <br/>\nas he giggled helplessly, or Bud would squeeze Colton&#39;s leg during a  <br/>\nparticularly intense moment. They were totally connected to each  <br/>\nother through their movie experience, and it was a joy to watch. I  <br/>\nknew that they were making a memory together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had cable reinstalled the next day, and we never looked back. We  <br/>\ndon&#39;t watch a lot of TV, but when we do, we do it together. We have  <br/>\nlaughed and cried together as we have watched, and we have wondered  <br/>\nand marveled. Television has been a wonderful learning experience for  <br/>\nme. It taught me to loosen up, and to appreciate those wonderful  <br/>\nmoments when I cocoon with my family. And when I watch my husband and  <br/>\nson stomping around the house like Godzilla as they destroy Tokyo, I  <br/>\nknow that I am standing on holy ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My 4 year old and the DVD player","postDate":"1168028812","msgId":27604,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxQTM3NTlBLTBFM0QtNEFCMS05Njk0LTk2RUYxNTQ3MDI4MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhBQ0RGMTc3LTIwQUYtNEQ1Qi1BQUM3LUQyN0VEQ0UxNzJBNEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGVubGhvMitzam9wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OEFDREYxNzctMjBBRi00RDVCLUFBQzctRDI3RURDRTE3MkE0QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27603,"nextInTopic":27605,"prevInTime":27603,"nextInTime":27605,"topicId":27597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/t/holly HOW Unschooled Kids Watch TV That page has some of the best art, and it was food made by Jacki s daughter Hannah [Non-text","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1232106520\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/holly\">http://sandradodd.com/t/holly</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHOW Unschooled Kids Watch TV<br/>\n<br/>\nThat page has some of the best art, and it was food made by Jacki&#39;s  <br/>\ndaughter Hannah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My 4 year old and the DVD player","postDate":"1168028713","msgId":27603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxREYxM0VDLUJDNjItNDJDNy04NjMwLTkwODI1QUEwQUE2MEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhBQ0RGMTc3LTIwQUYtNEQ1Qi1BQUM3LUQyN0VEQ0UxNzJBNEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGVubGhvMitzam9wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OEFDREYxNzctMjBBRi00RDVCLUFBQzctRDI3RURDRTE3MkE0QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27602,"nextInTopic":27604,"prevInTime":27602,"nextInTime":27604,"topicId":27597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/t/whatif What if little kids watch TV all day?

He literally watched all day <br/>\nlong a lot of days.  He watched the same episodes on Nichelodeon <br/>\nover and over.  I couldn&#39;t believe how much.  My oldest got <br/>\nobesessed with musicals and she spent a lot of time renting and <br/>\nwatching the classics (Hello Dolly is her favorite). <br/>\nJust when Jack seemed to be getting his fill and not watching so <br/>\nmuch, our cable company added Cartoon Network.

It was probably longer now that I think about it.  <br/>\nOfcoarse we were doing other things through all that time.

Puzzles and crafts.....Lots <br/>\navailable.  But he loved tv.  <br/>\nHe is 10 now.  He got over Cartoon Network at around 7 or 8.  Now he <br/>\njust watches the shows he really likes, like Avatar.  At around 8 <br/>\nAnimal Planet and Discovery Channel became the thing he watched <br/>\nmost.  We joined a 4-H group and the group is studying coastal <br/>\nbays.  Jack adds lots of information to the discussions.  He&#39;s quite <br/>\nimpressive with all his knowledge.  <br/>\n4 year old Jack found something in tv watching that met his needs.  <br/>\nSo did 8 year old Jack.  10 year old Jack does too but he is more <br/>\nmature and has a lot of different needs and desires.  His way of <br/>\nmeeting them has expanded, which leaves a lot less time for tv.<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t easy and I didn&#39;t always feel like I was doing the best <br/>\nthing for him, but I did let him have the freedom and I can&#39;t see <br/>\nany damage from all those years of hours and hours of watching.  I <br/>\nalso don&#39;t see any damage to our relationship that would have <br/>\nsuffered quite a bit had I tried to control his intense desire/need <br/>\nto watch.

It was an interesting experiment as we<br/>\nourselves had never been without TV and I noticed (a) that TV eats<br/>\ntime, which I no longer have in vast quantities as I did before having<br/>\nchildren and (b) I missed surprisingly little of it... in fact I felt<br/>\nrelieved at no longer being tempted to watch trash.<br/>\nThen my huband, suffering film withdrawal symptoms, bought a DVD<br/>\nplayer meant just for the 2 of us. <br/>\nA few months ago he showed it to my now 4-year old. <br/>\nSo the DVD player is now my son&#39;s favourite toy. He wakes up in the<br/>\nmorning, and asks to watch a DVD. He comes home after an outing, and<br/>\nasks for it again. He won&#39;t eat, drink or do anything but watch. This<br/>\nis worring because he is already a pretty thin boy.<br/>\nHe watches the same thing over and over again, studying it.

Each new DVD brings<br/>\nabout an 8-hour daily viewing schedule.<br/>\nI am also worried about the effect on me.

Or at least, not to<br/>\nanything less than hours a day.<br/>\nAnd the other worry I have is that he prefers a life in front a screen<br/>\nnow than he does his life outdoors and interacting with his family.<br/>\nSorry if I sound grumpy. I&#39;m probably just a bit scared. Anyone with<br/>\nexperience of this issue?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27645,"nextTopicId":27698}}
