I would have replied earlier but I \nhave only recently seen your post. I am a mum of two daughters who have \nalways been unschooled. I worked for some time as a Clinical \nPsychologist with a Child and Family Bereavement Service in the UK \nbefore having my daughters.<br></div><div><br>It sounds like you were \nclosely connected with the family that was involved in this tragic \naccident and that you spent a lot of time with them during the course of\n the week and that they were very much part of your lives.&nbsp;It would have\n been a huge shock and it is still very recent. It may feel as if your \nworld has been turned upside down.&nbsp;Finding things that can bring you \nsome comfort and familiarity at this time may help:&nbsp;things that you were\n used to doing as a family or for yourself, for example, going shopping \ntogether, walking the dog, watching a film, bringing food/drinks to \nfamily members and remembering to eat and to nurture yourself.<br>&nbsp;<br>It\n may also help to accept that your family life may look different for a \nwhile as you all take time to adjust to what has happened. The process \nof bereavement may last over many months and so it can be helpful to \ngive yourselves time to grieve and to heal.&nbsp;Talking through what has \nhappened either together or with those family members that would like to\n can be helpful. As can sharing memories and stories about what you were\n used to doing together as and when memories come up throughout the day.<br>Although\n this is an experience that you have all shared it can also help \nto&nbsp;recognise that each family member will grieve differently and may \nneed different things. Being radical unschoolers can be helpful as your \nchildren are used to you responding to them as individuals and being \nsensitive to their unique needs. Some family members might find it \nhelpful to talk about how they are feeling whilst others may prefer to \nexpress how they are feeling in different ways, such as in creative or \nphysical activities or they may want to distract themselves. Your \nchildren might want to be more or less involved with the family you were\n close to depending on how they are feeling and it is helpful for them \nto have a choice about their level of involvement. Knowing your children\n well will help guide you as will having conversations with them when it\n feels right and letting them know you or another trusted adult or \nfriend are available to talk to or to spend time with.<br></div><div><br>It\n can also be helpful to give the children the option to talk to someone \noutside of the immediate family whether that is a supportive family \nfriend they trust or a bereavement counsellor (depending on what feels \nmost comfortable to them). Sometimes children/young people might find it\n helpful to speak to someone outside of the family as they can be \nconcerned about upsetting their parents or causing them more pain. &nbsp;This\n might be the case if they are aware that you have experienced \ndepression and it might also help you to know that your children have an\n additional way of sharing their grief if you are feeling overwhelmed.<br>&nbsp;<br>I\n was not sure from your post who the surviving family members were, \ntheir ages and who was looking after them? It would be useful for you to\n know what support they have in place so that you know that they are \nbeing cared for, they are safe and their basic needs are being met and \nthis may provide some relief. This could include checking if they have \naccess to family bereavement support and counselling if they choose as \nwell as any practical support they might need. Finding out how the \nfamily might like you to be involved at this time will enable you to be \nin a better position to know how you can be supportive and what you are \nable to offer.<br></div><div><br>It can also be helpful to find ways of \nenabling your children to feel connected to the family members that died\n or are injured in both the short and longer term. This might be by \ntalking about things you did together, sharing stories or watching films\n that you all enjoyed or places you may have visited together. However, \nthis will depend upon how each person is feeling and wanting to do but \nit can be helpful for family members to know that the family will still \ncontinue to be a part of your lives although they may no longer be \nphysically present. It could also be worth exploring whether your \nchildren would like to visit the younger children who are injured in \nhospital or have some other way of staying in touch with what is \nhappening to them, for example, if they would like to be given updates \non their progress. They might like to write messages, draw pictures or \nsend a gift (depending upon what is meaningful to them). &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>I\n don&#39;t know whether the funeral has taken place for the parents that \nhave died but it might be helpful to consider how the children might \nwant to be involved and whether they would like to attend. If they don&#39;t\n there could be other ways of creating a meaningful/personalised ritual \ntogether to enable them to say goodbye. There is some information in the\n links below about supporting children around grief and loss and how to \ninclude them and prepare them for the funeral.&nbsp;</div><div><br>It&nbsp;can be \nhelpful for children and young people to be involved in what is \nhappening if they wish and to be given choices.&nbsp;You&nbsp;mentioned that they \nwanted to help with joyfully distracting the younger grandchildren and \nthis sounds like a good idea if this is something that you felt you \ncould help facilitate. It may bring some comfort and joy to the children\n and enable them to be involved and connected to the family in a \npositive way. Your&nbsp;children might have more ideas about how they would \nlike to be involved and ways of staying connected. When a death has \noccurred suddenly it is not unusual for the bereaved to experience \nseeing the deceased, to feel their presence or dream about them. For \nsome children this can bring comfort and connection while others might \nbe anxious about it. It can help to normalise these experiences and to \nlet them know it is something that often happens when a person is \ngrieving after a sudden loss. <br></div><div><br>---I have suffered from\n severe depression in the past, and this is a very depressing situation \nfor us as we want to support this family, and to be the reliable kind \nfriends they deserve. At the same time, I can feel the unavoidable \nnegative/depressing parts seeping into my own behaviour. I want to be \nthere for them (losing both parents at once is hard!) and also make sure\n I stay stable and positive for my own family.---<br></div><div><br>In \norder to be there for your family and to help maintain a peaceful nest \nit would help if you are feeling supported and that your feelings and \nneeds are being understood and listened to. Because you have experienced\n depression in the past it sounds like you feel concerned that you will \nbe pulled into a depth of grief and despair that might be overwhelming \nor may be difficult to re-surface from. This may be an understandable \nfear because you have been vulnerable to depression and you recognise \nthe feelings. However, it also sounds like you are in a different \nposition than you were in before because you have an awareness of this \nreaction in yourself to withdraw and you realise that it is not \nsomething that has been helpful to you or your family. The act of \nreaching out for support and talking about how you feel may enable you \nto find ways of experiencing your grief while staying connected with \nyour family.<br></div><div><br>What have you found that has helped when \nyou have been feeling low? It could help to talk to a supportive person \nwhether this is a grief counsellor or someone who is able to be there \nwith you, listen and be alongside you. Having an outlet for your \nfeelings and your fears might enable you to keep connected to your \nfamily whilst at the same time acknowledging and taking care of your own\n needs. It might also help to connect with someone that you trust in \nyour family or friendship circle and share with them how you are feeling\n so that they can be on your team and help notice if you are needing \nsome extra nurturing or support. Even things like offering you something\n to eat or drink or if you need a few moments to take a bath or a walk, \ngiving you a hug. Sometimes family members can provide each other with \nthis support and sometimes it helps to enlist the help of someone \noutside of the family.<br></div><div><br>In the UK there are charities \nand services such as the one I worked for that can offer support for the\n whole family at various stages in the grieving process. Sometimes \nissues may come up later in your journey and meeting with other families\n or talking with people who have a knowledge of bereavement and loss can\n be help. I don&#39;t know what is available where you live? However, there \nis information about grief and supporting yourself, children and family \nmembers in the links below. There are also books and publications linked\n to on these websites for both children and families who have \nexperienced a traumatic loss.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Winston&#39;s \nWish is a specialist bereavement service offering support for children \nand families.

I have been so inspired by all of these discussions. I felt completely drawn to giving my feed back about this sad, sad predicament. <br><div><br></div><div>My experience of trauma and how to deal with it within my family is extensive. I am a survivor, which also tends to draw me to depression on anger. On top of that we fled from the Four Mile Fire in Boulder, Colorado and relocated for six months. As soon as we got settled, I found a large lump on my neck and found out that I had stage 4 Lymphoma. My daughter was eight years old. Then she was attending a two room school house in the mountains. For the last four years she has been unschooled. </div><div>I know that this sounds crazy, but all of this trauma has made my daughter wise beyond belief. She has already lived many lives (if you know what I mean). The fire and cancer has given her lessons of being strong for our family as well as for others. She has very deep compassion for people who are sick, dying, loss of a a family member etc. </div><div>What I can share with you, is that although at the time, she had counselors in her second grade, the life experience of such an ordeal changed  her for ever and <span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1137629425\">unschooling</span> has given her the chance to feel what she is feeling, be directly involved with our family transitions and growth. </div><div>Although it has not been pretty, she has seen that through perseverance and compassion people can make it through horrific situations.  I was on anti depressants through Chemo, so I would not yell at her. I was constantly honest with her, explaining what was happening to my nervous system when she jumped on the bed. Or when my husband and I almost split up after thirty years and went to therapy and saved our precious family. She has seen first hand how all of it works if there is love and caring and a desire to heal. I think if she was in school, she would not have been able to see all of this transformation. </div><div>Be gentle with your clan, be honest, show them the big picture (loss and grieving, and growth and celebration). </div><div>By being honest of what you are going through and what they are going through they learn life lessons that most of us never learn until our 50s! I was always so protected in my child hood about death and trauma. And I had so much of it. </div><div>This is one thing I am learning about <span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1137629425\">unschooling</span>, is that my child who is now 12 is wise beyond her years. She has never been protected from life in these last four years. She is really experiencing it all and I am grateful for this.

We have been unschooling for almost four years. This last week, some people who have become very close to us were killed in a car accident on the road we travel almost every day (only way in and out of the village). They were only a few years older than myself and my husband, their two youngest kids are in coma/body cast and critical condition. This family has been above kind, responsible and caring with ours. Like family, warm and non judgmental. I am asking the group for suggestions in terms of my maintaining a peaceful nest at this time. I have suffered from severe depression in the past, and this is a very depressing situation for us as we want to support this family, and to be the reliable kind friends they deserve. At the same time, I can feel the unavoidable negative/ depressing parts seeping into my own behavior. I want to be there for them (losing both parents at once is hard!) and also make sure I stay stable and positive for my own family. We were either at their home or they were at ours several times a week, sharing meals and outings, and they live on the road where the accident happened. My kids are really close to the younger kids (grandkids who are under 6) and want to help with joyfully distracting them. I want to help my kids do this, and support my friends. I apologize if this is not an appropriate topic, but I am feeling torn between not being trustworthy or kind or putting up some wall to protect myself from the sadness. Any suggestions for finding this balance or managing to stay positive in the process and caring for my own kids? Thanks</span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76024,"nextTopicId":76029}}
