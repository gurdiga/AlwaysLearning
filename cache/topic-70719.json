I&#39;m the mother of a 15 yo and 12 yo, both boys. When<br/>\nGillen turned 13 a few years ago, as a result of talking about rites of<br/>\npassages in other cultures (I can&#39;t remember how this conversation was<br/>\ninitiated) Gillen went into the woods/back fields of our farm alone for 24<br/>\nhours. For him, who he is, it felt right to support him in doing something<br/>\nthat proclaimed the beginning of his journey into being a man. It was also<br/>\nat a time when we had watched a lot of &quot;Survivor Man&quot; on TV. It was pretty<br/>\nlaid back. He could have walked out of the woods to his grandmother&#39;s house<br/>\nat any time. But he loved gathering his own food and cooking it. He brought<br/>\na bow and arrow and maybe a gun, can&#39;t remember (he is a hunter), and made<br/>\na fire himself. He heard wild dogs at one point. But he had one of our dogs<br/>\nand a weapon with him so said he felt safe. The biggest challenge was in<br/>\nbeing alone for that long. He was really proud of this accomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse is going to turn 13 in June. He has not worked as much as Gillen did<br/>\nat that age and is not a farmer and outdoorsman like Gillen. If he were to<br/>\ngo alone to the woods for 24 hours it would be a very different challenge<br/>\nfor him. I don&#39;t even know that we would bring it up as a possibility. But<br/>\nI would like to acknowledge him in some special way.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Madeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Feb 28, 2013 at 12:21 PM, redknot20 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redknot@...\">redknot@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son, Joel, is 13 and I&#39;d like to do a coming of age celebration for<br/>\n&gt; him.

It included things like cooking a meal for 13 people, making a journey alone with 13 tasks along the way, and ... oh I wish I could remember more.
