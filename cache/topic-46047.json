But if the kid tries to explain why, they don&#39;t let him.  They won&#39;t listen.  They just get mad and punish them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  Do I do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan:  Well, no.  But I see it on cartoons all the time and in real life.  And with people I know.  It&#39;s frustrating, because sometimes there&#39;s a perfectly good explanation for what they did, but the parent won&#39;t even *listen* to it.<br/>\n  <br/>\nMe:  I know.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t do that.  Most families have rules, and the parents don&#39;t care about the reason the rule is broken.  It&#39;s more important for me to see what&#39;s going on, why something happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan:  I know!  It&#39;s so frustrating!  Sometimes there&#39;s a perfectly good explanantion that even the *parents* would agree with but they don&#39;t even let their kid tell them!  That doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46026,"nextTopicId":45977}}
