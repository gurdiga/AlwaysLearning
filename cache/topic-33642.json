I agree 100% with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to clarify the whole Abe-Hicks quote:  Esther Hicks in no way  <br/>\ntries to represent herself as anything to do with unschooling.  In  <br/>\nfact, recently a friend of mine mentioned to her something about  <br/>\nunschooling and she said, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;   Personally I have found  <br/>\nmany of their quotes inspirational and supportive of respectful  <br/>\nparenting and the principles of unschooling.  For me, they were the  <br/>\nfirst to plant the seed many years ago when talking about Sudbury.   <br/>\nBecause of their reference, I read the book, &quot;Free at Last&quot; and a door  <br/>\nto a new way of thinking about education and children opened for me.   <br/>\nThen years later I discovered John Holt and Unschooling and a bigger  <br/>\ndoor opened.  That was my path and my connection to Unschooling and  <br/>\nAbe-Hicks.  Esther Hicks makes no claim to unschooling and I don&#39;t  <br/>\nbelieve she has any desire to be known at all in the unschooling  <br/>\nworld.  They are just saying what they are saying, going along their  <br/>\npath.  And some of it gives me inspiration on my unschooling journey.   <br/>\nI would never ever have brought up Abe-Hicks on this list if Sandra  <br/>\nhadn&#39;t opened up the topic.  I would never represent unschooling as an  <br/>\noff-shoot of my spiritual philosophy.  I&#39;m on a journey, talking and  <br/>\ngrowing with others and it&#39;s helpful for me to put it all into context  <br/>\nwith regard to my spiritual beliefs.  If others find that helpful, I&#39;m  <br/>\nhappy to join in conversation with them.  But it&#39;s alway with the  <br/>\nunderstanding that these are my beliefs AND unschooling, not just  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for helping to clarify that.<br/>\nSunday</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: visualizing channelled juju","postDate":"1206640356","msgId":33707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2M0I2QzVELTRCMDQtNEUzOS04OUY0LTE4QjU3Njg3Q0Y3QkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU5QjAzOTBELTU3OTMtNDNFNi1CRkNDLUU4Q0Q5REMwNkY1RUBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZzZmFucStyMm44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RTBCQzQwODUtNTc5MC00N0I2LUIyQzUtQzJFRkUxQ0Y5NjNEQG5ldGNldGVyYS5jb20+IDxFOUIwMzkwRC01NzkzLTQzRTYtQkZDQy1FOENEOURDMDZGNUVAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33706,"nextInTopic":33708,"prevInTime":33706,"nextInTime":33708,"topicId":33642,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What they SAY might still be interesting and valuable, but their credibility is damaged for me, by the paranormal claims.

Same as &quot;trancendental meditation,&quot; but  <br/>\nhonestly?  **without the juju**--she told us which part of the  <br/>\ntraditions came from Hinduism and such.  She discussed the  <br/>\nphysiological realities and benefits, and that has always helped me.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s what I used when Kirby was little and lost his temper so easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMrs. Littlejohn used to bring New Age guest speakers to talk to us  <br/>\nabout color energy and healing color and protection from evil spirits  <br/>\nand we lived in a superstitious northern New Mexico town already  <br/>\nwhere such beliefs were all around all the time.

Not once have I ever advocated ascribing supernatural power to  <br/>\nany object.  In the 15 years that I&#39;ve been listening to Abraham-Hicks  <br/>\nI have never heard them recommend giving power to an object.  In fact,  <br/>\nthey recommend not giving your power away to anything, much less an  <br/>\ninanimate object.  Not once have I heard anyone who is talking about  <br/>\nLaw of Attraction, which seems to be the real issue here, advocate  <br/>\nascribing supernatural power to an object.  It&#39;s misleading and  <br/>\ninaccurate to talk about these ideas and practices as new age juju.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s  inaccurate to liken channeling, and especially visualization, to  <br/>\njuju.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I very much prefer thinking and doing to buck-passing and wishing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The ideas discussed by Abraham-Hicks have nothing to do with buck- <br/>\npassing and wishing.

It is useful  <br/>\ninformation with regard to what I post on her list though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether certain information is considered channeled or not is less  <br/>\nimportant to me than whether the information resonates with me and  <br/>\nhelps me be a more respectful, joyful parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I&#39;ve learned and benefitted from the ideas put forth by  <br/>\nSandra and other veteran unschoolers here, there have been many times  <br/>\nwhen I wanted to discuss an unschooling ideas from a more spiritual  <br/>\nperspective.  There have been many times when I have had something to  <br/>\nadd, but thought that it would be seen as too spiritual for this  <br/>\nlist.  So, I am very happy that there is a forum for those of us who  <br/>\ncame to unschooling as a natural expansion and expression of what we  <br/>\nhave learned on our spiritual paths.  And I&#39;m grateful to conferences  <br/>\nthat add options for us.  At Live and Learn, there have been topics on  <br/>\nZen and Unschooling and this year I think Scott Noelle is presenting  <br/>\nat Live and Learn.  He is as spiritual as you get and gathering from  <br/>\nhis writings gets much of his wisdom from Abraham-Hicks.  At the  <br/>\nRethinking Education Conference I will be presenting several options  <br/>\nfor those who want to go deeper into unschooling from a spiritual  <br/>\nperspective.  There is room in Unschooling for secular and spiritual  <br/>\nalike.  I don&#39;t think one needs to feel threatened by the other.   <br/>\nSeparate lists are great though. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is a WHOLE LOT of free information, better, purer, and it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t put any juju between you and your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because of this use of &quot;juju&quot; I&#39;m not clear on what Sandra is getting  <br/>\nat here.   I can&#39;t imagine that she&#39;s saying that if a person  <br/>\npractices visualization or studies a teaching that is &quot;channeled&quot; that  <br/>\nwill somehow put a barrier up between them and their children.  I have  <br/>\nto say that the specific teachings of Abraham-Hicks have brought down  <br/>\nmore barriers in my life that I can even begin to describe.  I am  <br/>\ndefinitely a better, more loving, gentle parent.  The basis of what  <br/>\nAbe-Hicks teachings is what has moved me from fear and control to  <br/>\ntrust and freedom more easily, especially with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you live in juju, it will affect your hour, your day and your<br/>\n&gt; lifetime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If by juju you mean the teachings of Abraham-Hicks, I certainly hope  <br/>\nit affects my day and my lifetime.  It&#39;s really good positive stuff  <br/>\nthat brings joy to me and my family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Every moment spent hoping for magical benefits could be spent gently<br/>\n&gt; and directly in contact with your children getting REAL benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes, the proof is in the pudding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been studying  <br/>\nand learning from Abe-Hicks for 15 years.  Many, many real benefits  <br/>\nand yes, magical and delightful and wonder-filled as well.  My  <br/>\nchildren have benefitted greatly from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; WAIT!

It is a disease that  <br/>\ncreates chaos and harm to the person and those in their lives.  I have  <br/>\nmet Esther Hicks and I have sat in her presences while she &quot;channeled&quot;  <br/>\nAbraham.  She is anything but delusional and paranoid.  She is  <br/>\ngrounded in this life, joyful and clear.  She is in complete control  <br/>\nof her senses and her body.  She doesn&#39;t call what she does  <br/>\n&quot;channeling&quot; but more the quieting of her ego and individual mind  <br/>\nchatter, so that she can hear universal wisdom.  Something we are all  <br/>\ncapable of doing if we choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so grateful to Sandra for the insights that I&#39;ve gained from being  <br/>\npart of this list.

I&#39;ve learned to trust my journey with my kids <br/>\nand I stand stronger now in the face of naysayers, negative opinions <br/>\nfrom family because of what I&#39;ve read and learned from <br/>\nAbraham/Esther.

I don&#39;t interpret it to be <br/>\nspeaking to young children and encouraging them to run away.  It <br/>\nspoke to me more in terms of an older child or adult who is capable <br/>\nof choosing what they want and yet don&#39;t because they are more caught <br/>\nup in doing what a parent would want or seeking parental approval. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a really great Abraham-Hicks quote in terms of unschooling is <br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\n----Home Schooled Children Feeling &quot;Free At Last?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuest: I have begun home schooling our children. However, finding the <br/>\nperfect teacher has been challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham: When people use the word &quot;teacher&quot;, the vibration that <br/>\nmatches the word often feels more like asserter than it does like <br/>\nallower. But, the ideal teacher is one who is an open vortex through <br/>\nwhich desire can be satisfied, where an asserter is one who has <br/>\ninformation that they are wanting to impart.<br/>\n<br/>\nJerry and Esther visited with a magnificent founder of a wonderful <br/>\nschool, *Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts. And he offered <br/>\nsomething that was so clarifying to Esther. He said that their <br/>\nteachers never say, &quot;Well, Johnny, don&#39;t you think you would like to <br/>\nlearn to read?&quot; because they are understanding that unless Johnny is <br/>\nasking to read, that the effort that everyone makes is going to be <br/>\nuncomfortable anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideal teacher is one who understands that desire to know is <br/>\nnatural, and is someone who stands by ready to offer examples to <br/>\nsatisfy the desire of the student... What made you realize it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nworking out?<br/>\n<br/>\nGuest: Behavior issues with the kids... they were not liking the <br/>\nrestraints...<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham: The kinds of things they said to you were, &quot;We thought it <br/>\nwas going to be a whole lot more fun. We thought we were going to get <br/>\nto do more of what we wanted to do, and we thought we were going to <br/>\nget to choose.&quot; And that&#39;s the way you felt when you were born, you <br/>\nthought you were going to get to choose, that was the bargain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then somebody else says, &quot;Well, here you are, and you don&#39;t get <br/>\nto choose. You don&#39;t get to choose where you sit, or when you come, <br/>\nor how long you sit there, and you don&#39;t get to choose what we think <br/>\nabout. You don&#39;t get to choose when you talk, and you don&#39;t get to <br/>\nchoose what we talk about. In other words, you are not free, you are <br/>\nour captives. And we are here to assert good stuff into you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they say, &quot;Ah, give me a break! That&#39;s not what the bargain was. <br/>\nI came understanding that I am a creator. I came knowing that I get <br/>\nto choose.&quot; It takes years to beat that out of them. It takes years <br/>\nand years before they are willing to sit there and be quiet and do <br/>\nonly what is supposed to be done when it is supposed to be done. It <br/>\ntakes a long time to conform you into your unhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, it is so delicious! When you have an environment where children <br/>\nfeel free, where they get to choose, and you are brave enough to ride <br/>\nit out...
