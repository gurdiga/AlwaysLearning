I&#39;m not saying that happened here.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has happened here, and probably will again, which is one reason  <br/>\nI&#39;m so watchful of the door, as it were.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes these discussions work is the true stories.  We can&#39;t  <br/>\nguarantee that people who pop in here and tell stories will be  <br/>\ntelling the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nA dozen years ago there was some discussion of that and while it&#39;s  <br/>\ntwo layers deep in philosophical what-ifs, those of us in the  <br/>\ndiscussion (several of whom are still around, still unschooling,  <br/>\nstill helping other people) kinda concluded that even if a poster  <br/>\nwere a mom-posing ) 85-year -old man who had no children, if the  <br/>\nadvice was good and useful, that would be more helpful than that of a  <br/>\nmom who had children but no clear grasp on reality or honesty.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years I have met lots and lots of moms and sometimes whole  <br/>\nfamilies that I once knew only from words on a screen, as you see  <br/>\nthese.  Lots of other families  have met me, my kids, my husband, and  <br/>\nseen my house, and a few have seen me sleep-deprived or tipsy and  <br/>\ngoofy.   I have no place to hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some who come to a discussion like this, or  <br/>\nunschooling.info, or back in the old days to unschooling.com or aol&#39;s  <br/>\nhomeschooling forum, and within a day or two people are saying  <br/>\n&quot;Wait... you said this...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral of them, twenty or more over the years, have risen up banshee  <br/>\nlike screeching &quot;You know NOTHING ABOUT ME!&quot; (or something in that  <br/>\narea of emotion).<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, well... at that point we know there&#39;s less-than-optimal mental  <br/>\nstability and calm.  But we knew that before, which is why people  <br/>\nwere saying, &quot;Hey, slow down.  Hold on.  Read before you post.  Think  <br/>\nbefore you write.  Breathe before you screech.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have an easy time in online discussions because they post  <br/>\nsimple truths and plain ideas and helpful suggestions, and they don&#39;t  <br/>\nget angry if other ideas trump theirs or others dissect their  <br/>\nsuggestions in bright unschooling light.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have an easy time because they&#39;re willing to pour out  <br/>\ntheir days for others&#39; encouragement, edification or amusement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have an easy time because they just don&#39;t post at all! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m  <br/>\nsurprised every single time, even if it&#39;s the same person telling me  <br/>\nagain, when someone refers to one of these discussions in person when  <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t post anything at all.    Me being me, I can&#39;t not post.  <br/>\nI&#39;m like Roger Rabbit responding to the knocked rhythm of &quot;shave and  <br/>\na haircut...&quot;   But some can, and so their lives are peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have a hard time because they come with anger, with cloudy  <br/>\nthinking, with a mind full of &quot;yeah but&quot; which they&#39;ve used before in  <br/>\nother situations.  Some like to blame other people, thing and  <br/>\nsituations  and have done so for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you who have never seen Vicky Pollard (a character from  <br/>\nLittle Britain) get a chance to see some, think of AlwaysLearning  <br/>\nwhen you see it.  Not the good posts, but those that get the list  <br/>\nbusy and crazy and all that.   (No, but... yeah, but... no, but...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!
