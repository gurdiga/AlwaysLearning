This boy already thinks my kids are weird because they *like*<br/>\nlearning. LOL He said &quot;I already finished learning about space in<br/>\nschool. We&#39;re done now&quot;. She started talking about Galileo&#39;s life and<br/>\ndifferent facts about the planets. He said &quot;I told you we already<br/>\n*finished* and now we&#39;re done.

Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>\n&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>\n&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>\n&gt; you get the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?

My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>\n&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>\n&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>\n&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>\n&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>\n&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>\n&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>\n&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>\n&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>\n&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>\n&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>\n&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>\n&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>\n&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>\n&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>\n&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>\n&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>\n&gt; you get the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?

I feel ready to say<br/>\nlots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>\nthis up first.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nTV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>\ndown with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>\nshows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>\nconversations have happened because of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>\nand games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>\nand baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>\nroom as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>\npassively and watch TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt offers siblings a chance to do something together. <br/>\nOr, it can get them apart!<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>\ndue to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>\nactivities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>\nbeginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>\nstudy of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>\nmovies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>\nmusical guests or TV concerts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>\nhas to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>\nsometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>\nto laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>\nmake me cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>\nand language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>\nglimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>\nnever see in person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>\nconnection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>\nwatched and liked when I was younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>\nus if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>\nfor him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>\nbonding.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>\nas a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>\nhousework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :). <br/>\nThese don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>\nfull advantage!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really adds to our never-ending list of questions. <br/>\nThe topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>\nand into new artistic endeavors.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>\ngreat conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>\nkids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>\nactors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>\nthan, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>\nbecause of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>\nfeeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>\nsometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>\ntheir grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>\nthey can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>\ngo to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>\nwith us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>\nand laugh and bond together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>\noften. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>\nand I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>\nbook in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>\nmost of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>\nwell according to their standards).  And it still<br/>\ngives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>\nthings I like to do with some noise on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>\nregard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>\nshows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>\ngo to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>\nthe same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>\nwatch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>\ninterests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>\nexperiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>\nyou get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I&#39;m not very good at it, I don&#39;t do it enough, but I knit and<br/>\nI enjoy knitting.  I enjoy the whole process, finding a pattern,<br/>\npicking out the yarn and the buttons and carrying it around with me<br/>\nhoping that I will finish it more quickly if I keep it present.  I<br/>\nhave a sweater (jumper for Brits--is it a jumper in Australia and NZ<br/>\nas well?) that I&#39;ve been working on since Christmas 3 years ago.  I<br/>\nhad to restart it once, and I ran out of the wool that I could only<br/>\nreplace by going to the U.S. to get it (which I did last summer).  I<br/>\nhave half of the sleeves and the turtleneck to finish.  Those are my<br/>\ncredentials as a potential instructor of knitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI taught myself to knit. My mom taught me when I was 7 or something,<br/>\nand I can remember lying on a lawn chair in the backyard with a ball<br/>\nof nylon blue yarn attempting to knit and getting horribly bored with<br/>\nit.  I didn&#39;t want to learn, or maybe I&#39;d asked, but wasn&#39;t actually<br/>\ninterested, just wanted something that I could do with my mom.  But,<br/>\nwhen I was pregnant with Linnaea I got a couple of books out from the<br/>\nlibrary and a pattern from a friend&#39;s wool shop and began the most<br/>\nill-fashioned sweater imaginable.  I worked on it when we were driving<br/>\nfrom Albuquerque to Wichita, KS for Christmas with my grandparents.<br/>\nWhen I got there Grandma looked through her piles of knitting supplies<br/>\nand found a pattern for a sweet little jacket for the baby to be.  Mom<br/>\nand I went out and bought some cotton yarn, and pulled apart the other<br/>\nmonstrosity, and I knit this little jacket.  And  Linnaea wore it in<br/>\nher passport photos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Simon or Linnaea were to approach me with a desire to knit, I would<br/>\noffer them the knitting bobbin thing that my mom gave us from France,<br/>\nwhich both of them have played with off and on.  And I would sit with<br/>\nthem.  I used to have a knitting machine where you crank the handle<br/>\nand feed the yarn into the dealy and out comes this long tube of a<br/>\nknitted thing which invariable became some sort of slightly homely<br/>\ndoll&#39;s dress, maybe I&#39;d find one of those to play with.  If they were<br/>\nreally interested in knitting, in making themselves something with<br/>\nyarn, I&#39;d show them how I knit.  I have tons of needles, my grandma<br/>\n(same grandma) gave me her collection, some of them make amazing<br/>\ndaggers (big, bright blue daggers with a white, very short hilt) so<br/>\ncould easily offer them the tools and I have lots of wool lying about.<br/>\n I even have a little drop spindle so they could spin their own wool,<br/>\nwhich is lots of fun and lead to Simon collecting lots of balls of<br/>\nwool for me from the Blue County Fair in Minnesota last summer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would be careful not to push knitting on them.  I find that<br/>\nthere are many things, like knitting, that I had to grow into.  Maybe<br/>\nat 7 when I lay on my lawn chair in the warmth of the Nebraska sun<br/>\npart of what kept me from paying attention to perling and knitting was<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t have the hand-eye coordination yet.  My hands hadn&#39;t<br/>\ngrown into knitting. Or maybe it was that running through the<br/>\nsprinkler or hiding in the prohibition hole under the closet floor<br/>\nwere much better ways to spend my free, not-in-school, glorious summer<br/>\ndays.  For years I saw knitting as something beyond my ability because<br/>\nof those moments on the chair. Embroidery suffered at the same hands.<br/>\n I wouldn&#39;t make them fearful of the difficulties of knitting.  But I<br/>\nwould be careful to make sure that their path with knitting wasn&#39;t<br/>\npaved with frustrations.  I wouldn&#39;t strew their path with the<br/>\nfrustration of believing that they could only learn to knit if they<br/>\ntaught themselves from a book, as I did.

If the kids want to take a book of any kind and learn from it and need some instruction maybe because it is above their own learning at the moment should I say *no, son if you can&#39;t do it yourself and I need to teach how to do it so you can learn then you need to learn how on your own or wait untill you can do it yourself sorry.*  That doesn&#39;t seem right to me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterary Child &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:literarychild@...\">literarychild@...</a>&gt; wrote:  I would love everyone&#39;s input to help me understand further what the label<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; means to everyone.
