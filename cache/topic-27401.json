LOL) and helping them as their guide and example (working on that!) <br/>\n  I believe in my heart unschooling works, but do occasional battle with the old &quot;ghosts&quot; I was indoctrinated with and in which we are bombarded with every day-- anyone know what I mean? <br/>\n  My kids never cease to astonish and amaze me with their ability to learn and impact their world without curriculum and lessons. <br/>\n  I am looking forward to meeting some of you and gleaning wisdom from more experienced unschoolers.  Hopefully I will help someone in the process.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Rachel<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n    To repeat what others have said, requires education, to challenge it,<br/>\nrequires brains.--Mary Pettibone Poole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNeed a quick answer?
