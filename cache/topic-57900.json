He has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome with delayed reading/writing. Pokemon books and games helped him learn how to read! It relieved so much stress and worry as we had tried so many other methods of learning/teaching.

I don&#39;t even know what Pokemon is.&quot;  My<br/>\nfresher, (but still freshening brain), said &quot;Hmmm.  Here is a chance to<br/>\napply what I am learning on this list and in my reading.  He is interested<br/>\nin this.  Of all the books in the bookstore, he chose this one.  Here is my<br/>\nchance to support his interests without bias.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I said sure.  &quot;Want anything else?&quot;  Nope.  He (age 7) read it all the<br/>\nway home, and past midnight in his room.  He began asking me: &quot;How high is 4<br/>\nfeet?&quot;  &quot;How do you tell the symbol for inches from the symbol for feet?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;How much do I weigh?&quot;  Then he began making comparisons of the sizes of<br/>\nPokemon to himself.  We went to the library and took out the maximum number<br/>\nof videos we could on our card--all Pokemon.  He was jumping for joy.  We<br/>\nwatched them, and we went back for more--twice in one week!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he has started drawing characters and writing stats for them.  He<br/>\ncalculates the maximum damage each character can do, given their weaknesses<br/>\nand resistances.  Today, he designed, and made his own Energy cards.  He is<br/>\nmaking characters out of sculpy, and has designed his favourite character<br/>\ncostume to wear this Halloween.  He has given two of his favourite cards to<br/>\nhis good friend, and is currently trying to teach him how to play the game.<br/>\n Oh, and by the way, I&#39;m hooked on it too!  It is full of everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I want to say thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences and<br/>\nanswering all of our questions.  Your efforts go directly into the homes of<br/>\nothers and make positive change happen.  If I had listened to that old voice<br/>\nof mine, I wouldn&#39;t be watching my son do all of the things I couldn&#39;t coax<br/>\nhim to do a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nGratefully,<br/>\nKaren.<br/>\njamesfamilyedutrip.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57850,"nextTopicId":57880}}
