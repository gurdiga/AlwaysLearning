Each circle represents an interest. A kid moves from circle to <br/>\ncircle - they are like stepping stones. The child creates his or her own <br/>\npath by moving from one stepping stone to another.. Some are part of a <br/>\npath that goes straight to some ultimate goal or achievement, others are <br/>\npart of paths that meander and let the person have a variety of <br/>\nexperiences. Some are part of paths that twist and turn. Sometimes the <br/>\nkid sits on one of them for a really long time. Sometimes the path leads <br/>\naway from the current interest to something seemingly unrelated. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, we can often see the path pretty clearly. But we can&#39;t <br/>\nlook ahead and know what the path is going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a guy (he&#39;s in his late 20&#39;s, maybe even 30) who was <br/>\nhomeschooled, mostly unschoolishly, and he loved history. LOVED it. His <br/>\nfamily used to go to garage and estate sales and library sales and he&#39;d <br/>\nsearch for history books -  one of is favorite things to do was read <br/>\nabout one period of history, in history books written at different <br/>\ntimes, and compare their treatment of that time period. He was super <br/>\ninto all this for many years. And then he just dropped it in his late <br/>\nteens and decided to pursue engineering. He studied a bunch of formal <br/>\nmath, on his own, and got into a prestigious engineering college and has <br/>\nhad a wonderful career already.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did his interest in history come from? Where did his interest in <br/>\nengineering come from? Does it matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own daughter, who spent all her teen years very focused on ceramics, <br/>\nworking in a ceramics studio and in a clay and glaze manufacturing <br/>\ncompany, got a college degree in recreation and work running programs <br/>\nfor adults with developmental disabilities and now is in the process of <br/>\napplying to grad school to become a marriage and family therapist. I can <br/>\nsee, looking back,  how one thing led naturally and logically to another <br/>\n- but certainly could never have predicted the path.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter always loved to play in mud and sand and water. I made <br/>\nhomemade playdough very very often - once or more each week - when she <br/>\nwas a kid. And I put weird things in it - oatmeal and pineapple <br/>\nflavoring, etc.  She fingerpainted with pudding in the bath tub. Where <br/>\ndid those interests come from? I don&#39;t see why it matters. What matters <br/>\nis that playing around with clay and playdough and fingerpaints and <br/>\nother goopy, soft stuff gave her pleasure so I offered more <br/>\nopportunities to do more of it in lots of different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

That, to me, sounds incredibly boring unless it was something that I really wanted to do.  It&#39;s tedious to deconstruct clothing, it involves stitch ripping, ever done that?  If Heidi has a blouse and she is wanting it to look different for the sake of fashion, deconstructing will be interesting, or a means to an end, either way it will be her process.

Letting kids gather up what they want as you go about life, letting things graze their brains while other things stick and not holding onto expectations of what those things might be.  Passing interest and whimsy are very important to unschooling!  Little connections that build onto other little connections turn into a bigger sphere of knowledge.

It has Macaulay Culkin in it and it&#39;s based on a true story and book.  It has nudity and bloody stuff in it.... but still very interesting costumes and lifestyle that Chamille was hugely fascinated with for a long time, she moved on to Jeffree Star who is a more 21st century gender bending fashion drama music queen.

So that kind of fit in with what she&#39;s always liked.  We watched Queen Margot, mostly since it&#39;s her sister&#39;s name, and that queen was all about lavish fashion.  I remember once having a fairly long conversation about cod pieces after watching a period movie, which led to a conversation on sexually transmitted diseases, since it&#39;s been theorized that Henry the 8th wore them because he had groin issues from a sexually transmitted disease.  Cod pieces became really popular because of him and then went out of style when Queen Elizabeth came to power, no surprise there!  Then, that led to make-up and the chemistry of make-up and what that white face stuff is made of and why it made people sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther period pieces led to learning about wigs and legal dressage.  That&#39;s fascinating too, and ties into making hair pieces, which is something else that Chamille and I do.
