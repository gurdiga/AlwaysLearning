While I do not want to &quot;do school&quot;, I do want <br/>\nJacob to decide how and what he wants to learn.  He is asking for <br/>\nmath problems on paper, like school worksheets.  I have NEVER done <br/>\nworksheets with him.  What should I do.  Do I just print off one <br/>\nfrom a website when he asks for them, or do I buy a workbook and <br/>\nleave it on the book shelf with all the other books for him to pick <br/>\nup when he feels like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, do I sit there with him and do it if that is what he <br/>\nasks.  I am assuming he wants me to replace his teacher&#39;s role at <br/>\nhome from what he is saying because that is what he envisions <br/>\nhomeschool to be.  Keep in mind that he has never seen James and I <br/>\nat the kitchen table with &quot;school work&quot;.    How can I open his mind <br/>\nback up to everything if he is stuck on &quot;doing school at home&quot;.  He <br/>\nis a persistent little guy.  Any advice would be welcomed.<br/>\nKathy Johnson from NY</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18805,"nextTopicId":18798}}
