He was excited to learn that there was<br/>\nactually a list like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I wasn&#39;t very detailed.  He has the game, Diablo II, and has been<br/>\nplaying it all year in his spare time.  He was even waking up at 5:00am to<br/>\nplay it before school started each morning.  This is my son who slept until<br/>\nnoon for most of his life!  (He had never been to school)  I want him to<br/>\nbeat Diablo already so that he can move on to something else.  He has<br/>\nlearned so much from playing this game:  looking up cheats, downloading and<br/>\ninstalling programs to help him move up levels, and he even made a web page<br/>\nabout games that he likes.  I want him to come home so that he can continue<br/>\nto learn, but it was his idea to try out public school and I thought I would<br/>\nmake him do one year.  He enjoys school, but he enjoyed home too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also want him to come back home because we used to travel when we all were<br/>\non the same schedule.  My husband does shift work and has seven consecutive<br/>\ndays off each month!  (if he takes three days off, he ends up with 14<br/>\nconsecutive days off!)  We have not been able to just pick up and go since<br/>\nhe is trying out public school.  My son sees pros and cons for with both<br/>\nsettings; public and home.  He likes public school some days and he wants to<br/>\nreturn home on others. I just tried to help in that decision by telling him<br/>\nthat if he came home, he could play his game more and maybe even meet some<br/>\nkids who play too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI did want him to put in ONE year of public school, since it was his idea to<br/>\ntry it out.  I didn&#39;t want him to go back and forth in his mind.  This<br/>\npublic school experience DEMYSTIFIED the whole public school concept in his<br/>\nmind and he knows he was never missing out on anything. But this has been<br/>\nthe most inactive year of our family life because of the school&#39;s schedule!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he loves most about school: report cards  (He has no negative<br/>\nassociation with them so he thinks they are exciting and new!  We never<br/>\ntested or kept grades, except at his request in third grade.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me vent.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/rebeccawow.geo\">http://www.geocities.com/rebeccawow.geo</a>&gt; Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to<br/>\nsolve. -Roger Lewin<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Question about Diablo II","postDate":"1112545389","msgId":21939,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmYi41YmRkNmMwLjJmODE3MjZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21938,"nextInTopic":21945,"prevInTime":21938,"nextInTime":21940,"topicId":21938,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/3/05 9:17:18 AM, rebeccawow@sbcglobal.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1584613371\">In a message dated 4/3/05 9:17:18 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebeccawow@...\">rebeccawow@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I really want him to come<br/>\nback home next year - I&#39;ve seen the attitude change -  and I was trying to<br/>\nthink of an incentive. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wants to come home, why should he have to wait until next year?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if he doesn&#39;t want to come home, and he came home for a video game, would <br/>\nthat really be enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\nAlso, are there any unschool discussion groups for children?
