My one long time friend and I are <br/>\nChristians and unschoolers, all the other homeschoolers we know are <br/>\nChristian Structured Curriculum types. They are wonderful people, <br/>\nthey think we are nuts, wrong, worldly, lazy a bad example for the <br/>\npublic as to what homeschooling is about.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have another very close friend who is on the board of  &#39;Christian <br/>\nHome Educators of Ohio&#39; I love this woman, our children are of <br/>\nsimilar ages, our belief in God is the same and we even have a <br/>\nsimilar &quot;routine&quot;. We both have the habit of getting up in the <br/>\nmorning, doing some chores, eating breakfast, reading out loud to <br/>\nchildren for awhile and then getting on with the day. The difference <br/>\nis what we do next (and that I do not follow the routine when nobody <br/>\nfeels like it!), her family goes off to various quiet places and <br/>\nworks on academics while mine goes off wherever and does whatever and <br/>\nit is seldom quiet or academic. She and I put on a seminar every <br/>\nspring for parents of high school student. I volunteer to help her <br/>\nevery year because she lets me talk. I want people to know that when <br/>\n(not if!) they get burned out with the traditional high school <br/>\nnonsense, there IS another way!! They think I am a little weird, I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen made fun of some but I just tease them back. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a member of this group because I truly love the people and my <br/>\nchildren have friends there, especially among the long time members. <br/>\nI feel a need to be available to people who are just starting out. My <br/>\noldest is &#39;graduating&#39; this Spring and everyone is asking me why he <br/>\nisn&#39;t participating in the group&#39;s graduation ceremony. When I tell <br/>\nthem it is because he doesn&#39;t want to spent money to rent a stupid <br/>\nlooking blue gown I get some funny looks but I think it is good for <br/>\nthem to see that there really is another way to think about <br/>\nhomeschooling and that one CAN be an unschooler and a Christian at <br/>\nthe same time. Although I admit, sometimes I do get sucked into peer <br/>\npressure and care too much about what people think about me but I am <br/>\nfinally feeling comfortable discussing unschooling with those who <br/>\ndisagree. It feels good and actually, I am more comfortable in the <br/>\ngroup now that I have &quot;come out of the closet&quot; so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sad thing is that Christians seem to think that following <br/>\na &quot;rigorous&quot; academic program has something to do with being <br/>\nrighteous. From what I have read in my Bible, that isn&#39;t in there. <br/>\nAlso, Proverbs6 about Train up a child in the way he should go... <br/>\nmeans encourage him according to his natural bent, not beat the sin <br/>\nout of him. There is some misunderstanding about that. I think Jesus <br/>\nwas an Unschooler! He and his disciples went around doing life and <br/>\ntalked about it, there was no classroom. I don&#39;t mean to get on a <br/>\nsoapbox but it just frustrates me to no end that so few people get <br/>\nthat Christianity is about freedom!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo end on a humorous note... once I was at a home birth meeting, <br/>\nexpecting baby#4, and another pregnant lady who was a pagan also <br/>\nexpecting her 4th child told me that her friends were teasing her <br/>\nthat if she had any  more babies, people would start to think she was <br/>\na Christian!
