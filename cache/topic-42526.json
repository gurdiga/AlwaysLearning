Wyl (9) was interested in maps from a very young age  and we were both <br/>\nhappy for him to have a map in the back seat, looking at the  lines while I <br/>\ndrove, noticing the same numbers on the highways signs and on the  maps.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince he learned to read, I print 2 copies of my directions  when I need to <br/>\nuse a mapping program and have him read in the back. That also  helps him <br/>\nunderstand how to give people good directions, and how miles compare  to passage of <br/>\ntime. At first, he&#39;d read through the directions from start to  end, without <br/>\nlooking up, so he was done with trips in less than a minute. After  I <br/>\nexplained to him that if he waited until after I got done with the first line  of <br/>\ninstructions, then giving me the next (or two ahead), it was easier for me to  <br/>\nremember and easier for me to follow. He&#39;s very good about remembering when I  <br/>\n(not a number-memory person) need the highway number I&#39;m looking for on the  <br/>\nsigns. He&#39;s got a very good number memory, so I&#39;m very happy to have him  <br/>\n&quot;co-pilot&quot; for me!<br/>\n <br/>\nWith the travel we&#39;ve done this year, Storm (4) is beginning  to get <br/>\ninterested in where things are (where&#39;s Tennessee?), so we bought a  *big* atlas of <br/>\nNorth America last time we were at the store.
