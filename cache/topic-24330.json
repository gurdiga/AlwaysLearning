A friend of mine is<br/>\nmoving away, so we are having a big dinner on Saturday<br/>\nnight to say goodbye.  Our dining room is too small<br/>\nfor the number of people coming so I moved the dining<br/>\nroom into the living room today....what a difference! <br/>\nMy two older kids came home from the neighbor&#39;s house<br/>\nand immediately tried out the new locations of the<br/>\ncouches, found projects that I had set on the table<br/>\nthat had been long forgotten and lost under the<br/>\nradiator,  and set up cozy spots in the corners.  It<br/>\nhas been wonderful...I think we all feel like we&#39;re<br/>\nliving in a new space (very important in the middle of<br/>\na New England winter!)  and all it took was a little<br/>\nmuscle.<br/>\nThanks again, Sandra, for planting the seed......maybe<br/>\ntomorrow we&#39;ll  do some shuffling upstairs!!<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
