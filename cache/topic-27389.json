I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember exactly how old he was, because it just wasnt that big of a <br/>\ndeal. I didnt teach him. In fact, other than modelling using the <br/>\nbathroom myself, i didnt even really encourage him. We had potty <br/>\nseats sitting around, he&#39;d sit on them sometimes, even pee in them <br/>\nsometimes, but it wasnt really a big deal. I figured he would learn <br/>\neventually. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he did. He&#39;s now 10 yrs old, and uses the toilet all the time. <br/>\nGo figure!;o)  Actually he does wear pull-ups(goodnites)at <br/>\nnight,because he is a very deep sleeper and will otherwise wet. I <br/>\nfigure he&#39;ll grow out of that too, eventually. I know i did. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd because my son learned to use the bathroom eventually, and <br/>\nstopped nursing eventually, and started sleeping in his own bed <br/>\neventually, it was easy for me to accept that he would learn to read <br/>\neventually, in his own time and at his own pace. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who&#39;s son is a year younger than mine. He got <br/>\nunderwear for his 2nd birthday (amongst other presents of course!)<br/>\nShe began potty training him from the time he was two....by the time <br/>\nhe was 3.5 he was using the toilet regularly, just like my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like a lot of work and worry, for something that WILL (barring <br/>\nany developmental problems)work itself out on its own. I found it <br/>\nwas alot more work to have a child potty-training-in-progress, than <br/>\nto have one who is completely ready to use the toilet. I found <br/>\ndiapers alot easier, you didnt have to constantly ask if he has to <br/>\ngo, deal with accidents, leave movies early to go to the potty, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts really not that dissimilar to unschoolers learning to read vs a <br/>\nparent teaching a child to read. I couldve struggled with my son and <br/>\ngot him to stumble through early readers. But i just let it go. He <br/>\nskipped all the simple stuff and went straight for the good stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestion....don&#39;t worry about it. If you push him, he will <br/>\nknow it, and might resist. If you tell him he will be able to use <br/>\nthe potty when his body is ready, it will take the pressure off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265197527,"authorName":"Heather","from":"&quot;Heather&quot; &lt;johevili72@...&gt;","profile":"johevili72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Potty Training Advice Needed","postDate":"1165178913","msgId":27394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVrdmQ3MStlZW9jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEREMUFFQkVCLTNFQUMtNERENi1COTI0LTQzNUZGMzlFMjUwQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":27393,"nextInTopic":27395,"prevInTime":27393,"nextInTime":27395,"topicId":27389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for that.

It&#39;s also the kind <br/>\nof training Alfie Kohn derides in &quot;Punished by Rewards.&quot;  Kind of a <br/>\nconundrum for an unschooler, I know :-)  But, I wasn&#39;t an unschooler <br/>\nback then!<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the book, got the tools together (cloth panties, a baby doll <br/>\nthat could wet, salty snacks, juice boxes, M&M&#39;s, an apron for me to <br/>\nput snacks), told my dd that this would be the day she would never have <br/>\nto wear diapers again, and endured the screams of protest (&quot;I will <br/>\nNEVER wear panties!!!&quot;).  I didn&#39;t let it get to me, just proceeded to <br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; the doll to use the potty.  I could go into greater detail <br/>\nabout the method, or you could find the book if you&#39;re interested.  <br/>\nJust to say that the title was dead on: it took less than two hours to <br/>\ngo from screaming protests to smiling, &quot;I&#39;m never going to wear diapers <br/>\nagain!&quot;  She didn&#39;t -- and she never once wet her pants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time he brother was old enough, I&#39;d absorbed a lot of criticism <br/>\nof this method (&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just operant conditioning,&quot; implying it was <br/>\nsomehow bad), so I didn&#39;t use it with him.

Since Elmo is his favorite! <br/>\nNo dice!)I put him in cloth training pants every few days to &#39;try <br/>\nagain&#39; but he and I both end up frustrated when he ends up <br/>\nwetting/messing his pants and just go back to diapers or pull-ups. <br/>\nHave read a bit about letting him go about w/ no pants on at all, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s pretty cold and don&#39;t know if he&#39;d get too cold?

I am frustrated and feeling like a bit of a failure. <br/>\nLike, if I can&#39;t even teach him to use the toilet, how will I EVER <br/>\nteach him to read, write, etc etc etc... He&#39;s a bright little boy in <br/>\nother areas and he likes to sit on the toilet, but just to &#39;pretend&#39; <br/>\nand practice &#39;wiping&#39;(he&#39;s observed his Dad and I going to the <br/>\nbathroom as we&#39;ve read that is a good idea for him to see so he <br/>\nknows &#39;what to do&#39;)... But as for him actually going in the toilet, <br/>\nNO SUCCESS at all...?? Has anyone else had a &#39;late bloomer&#39; in <br/>\ntoileting and advice one what they did? As I&#39;ve posted before too, <br/>\nhe&#39;s somewhat speech delayed and has only, in the last month or two, <br/>\nbeen using the &#39;potty training jargon&#39; from the books I&#39;ve been <br/>\nreading him. Any help or advice would be GREAT!!<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n Smiles,<br/>\n Heather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27399,"nextTopicId":27401}}
