Over the years he has been medicated for<br/>\nADD and (more recently) depression, and always arrives with containers<br/>\n of meds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m horrified at what the adults in his life (single mom and school<br/>\nauthorities) want to put into this marvelously bright, creative kid. <br/>\nI have been able to see what some of the meds to do him, and have had<br/>\nconversations with his mother (who has many medical problems and has a<br/>\nhealthcare-related job) about what he takes and why.  In the end,<br/>\nsince he loves coming here and we love having him, that was the first<br/>\npriority.  Here&#39;s what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I make sure I know what all the pills coming into our house<br/>\nwith him are. Sometimes they arrive in the wrong containers, with no<br/>\ninfo, and I think THAT is dangerous.  I want to know about side<br/>\neffects and symptoms.  Sometimes this means calling up the mother to<br/>\nclarify, or looking them up on the internet if she&#39;s not sure (which<br/>\nis amazing to me all by itself.)<br/>\n   <br/>\nIf whatever meds he is currently on (they often change between visits)<br/>\n can be used &#39;as needed&#39;, I ask his mother if we could try NOT giving<br/>\nthem while he&#39;s here.  As time has gone by, she&#39;s agreed to this. We<br/>\nlet him know that if he feels he NEEDS to have that med he is free to<br/>\nhave it (this has only happened twice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe depression meds and others which can&#39;t be safely stopped and<br/>\nstarted just have to continue while he&#39;s here.  We try to make it no<br/>\nbig deal although he does have to be reminded to take them, which I<br/>\nmust admit is hard to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the boys have grown (they&#39;re now young teens) we&#39;ve been able to<br/>\ntalk about his school situation, and how he feels about the medicine.<br/>\n He knows we support his being who HE is, and that we love him that<br/>\nway.  Being part of our unschooling life gives him a breather and<br/>\nchance to see that there are other ways to learn and live.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll we can give to other people&#39;s children, much as we care about<br/>\nthem, is our love and a chance to relax with folks who think they&#39;re<br/>\nfine the way they are.  Sometimes we can help the parents -- I think<br/>\nit&#39;s useful for his mother to know that we appreciate who he really<br/>\nis, unlike their relatives, the school, and other people in his<br/>\nstrictly-controlled life who prefer a quiet, apparently compliant<br/>\nrobot. She can gets to see him through a different lens, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThea (long-time lurker)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Laura Parrish&quot; &lt;parrishml@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\nI have a hard  time getting past my parents dropping the girls off,<br/>\nwithout telling <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; me first about the ADD drug.
