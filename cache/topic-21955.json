My<br/>\n15 yo freshman son started public school for the first time last year in the<br/>\n8th grade. That was a very fun year for him and all went well. No struggles,<br/>\nself-motivated, got himself up and went happily each morning. This year,<br/>\nabout two months in, he said he wanted to unenroll. He said he had things he<br/>\nwanted to do. The school said he could return in January if he wanted. So he<br/>\nunenrolled, mostly hung out at home, worked on the inground skate bowl that<br/>\nhe&#39;s building in the backyard, then went back in January. He had no trouble<br/>\n&quot;catching up&quot; and is now again saying he doesn&#39;t want to go, nothing is<br/>\nmeaningful, it&#39;s all crap, BUT he wants to stick it out to finish, because<br/>\nthat makes sense to him (maybe for his future plans?? I&#39;m not really sure<br/>\nwhy, but supporting him nonetheless).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it FEELS like allowing a child who has chosen to school to stay home<br/>\nwhenever he felt like it COULD promote some kind of irresponsible behavior<br/>\npattern, but I think that is just a feeling, not necessarily reality. It<br/>\nprobably would reek havoc with his experience in school when he did go. My<br/>\n16 yo (different child) is unschooling and taking classes at the art high<br/>\nschool. He doesn&#39;t want to go half the time. The problem with that is when<br/>\nothers are depending on him, like the drama group he is in. I remind him of<br/>\nthese things, but still let him make the decisions that he then has to live<br/>\nwith. He seems to be learning how it works, and what happens when people are<br/>\ndisappointed because he didn&#39;t &quot;do his part&quot;. I think he is also learning<br/>\nwhat he is and isn&#39;t really interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese experiences may feel and look messy because they don&#39;t follow the<br/>\nsystem&#39;s schedule, but isn&#39;t that how our thinking and learning really<br/>\nhappen? Individually? All over the place? In different ways at different<br/>\ntimes? The public school system is a one-size-fits-all program that, if<br/>\nfollowed to a T, numbs children to their own passions. It is hard to be in<br/>\nthat system for any period of time and stay true to one&#39;s own needs and<br/>\ndesires. It makes complete sense to me that some days a child feels like<br/>\ngoing, and some days they don&#39;t. And maybe even a few months on and a few<br/>\nmonths off. It&#39;s not the way a teacher or administrator would like it to<br/>\nhappen, and that is probably what makes some of us think that if our child<br/>\nchose to go to school, he needs to stick it out for the year. But that<br/>\nteacher and that administrator does NOT have our individual children&#39;s needs<br/>\nin mind. That&#39;s our job. And it takes real courage sometimes to support our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21954,"nextTopicId":21949}}
