What bothers me is when people tell me or<br/>\nLexie that Lexie is too young to do something simply because she is not<br/>\n8 or 10 or 13.  Example--serving food at a Thanksgiving dinner for<br/>\nhomeless families.  This is something Lexie wanted to do.  I had the<br/>\nidea that she could help hand out cups of juice, or put rolls on<br/>\npeople&#39;s plates, etc.  But no, she is not old enough to do this, she<br/>\nmust be 13.  Today we went to a place where the serve meals to homeless,<br/>\netc. but also one day a year they give out presents to kids.  They have<br/>\na line (and I do mean a line, last year they gave out over 800 gifts,<br/>\nbut this year they were expecting twice that many--there were a lot of<br/>\nkids!) and they have an &quot;escort&quot; take the child (no adults, parents<br/>\nmeet their chidlren at the exit, the whole process takes about 5<br/>\nminutes, but if there were toddlers or babies that didn&#39;t want to leave<br/>\nmom, that was ok, mom could come), pick up a stuffed animal, a video<br/>\ntape, and a wrapped present.  The escort was required to find out the<br/>\nchild&#39;s name and age, and then tell a &quot;runner&quot; what type of wrapped<br/>\npresent to get.  The escort would then take the child to santa, who<br/>\nwould give the wrapped present to the child and &quot;Mrs Claus&quot; would give<br/>\nthe child a candy cane or other candy.   The child and escort woudl then<br/>\nprecede to the exit where someone would stamp their hand (so they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t return) and the mother (or father, grandfather, etc.) would<br/>\npick up the child.  Anyway... Lexie was told she was too young to be an<br/>\nescort and that I would have to go with her.  This is what she was told<br/>\non the phone she woudl do (and I told them her age on the phone) so she<br/>\nwas disappointed but told me privately she was going to do such a good<br/>\njob they would see how well she coudl do it without help.  So she did.<br/>\nShe learned how to ask in Spanish what the child&#39;s age was (she already<br/>\nknew how to say &quot;what is your name?&quot; I just followed her and her child<br/>\nthrough the line as she escorted about 6 children.  Then she wanted to<br/>\ntry to be a runner, so she did that for a good half an hour, all by<br/>\nherself.  She was very cute, remembering the escort and child, so she&#39;d<br/>\ngive her gift to the correct team, and running quick, and then waiting<br/>\nin line patiently behind the other runners, all adults and teens.  After<br/>\na bit of that, she wanted to be an escort again.  I set Lexie up to work<br/>\nwith a teen but after a few times around, I noticed she was going by<br/>\nherself.  I watched her in the line, I just wasn&#39;t following her any<br/>\nmore, and she did fine.  I asked the teen and she said &quot;she does need me<br/>\nand they noticed that!&quot;  I watched Lexie very carefully, there were a<br/>\nlot of people there, but she had already made friends with all the other<br/>\nvolunteers and she was pretty much in my sight or close to it 100% of<br/>\nthe time, and she did so good, and was so happy and pleased with herself<br/>\nfor being able to do this herself.  A few of the volunteers in charge<br/>\ncame up to me and told me how wonderful she was, and how capable she<br/>\nwas, how sure of herself, and confident, etc. The person that said she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it by herself admitted, sorta, that Lexie could be an<br/>\nescort.  The only snag in it was until all the volunteers got used to<br/>\nthe fact that she was HELPING,they kept trying to give her gifts,<br/>\nincluding santa!  Anyway, this is the long way of saying that in this<br/>\ncase, in MOST cases, people need to trust the parents to know their<br/>\nchild&#39;s abilities.  Of course, I know most parents aren&#39;t like we are,<br/>\nand most kids aren&#39;t like Lexie, but you know, I often think that they<br/>\ncould be.  I think so many kids don&#39;t meet their potental, ever, because<br/>\nof low expectation by everyone involved--parents, teachers, society.<br/>\nLexie did what she did today (and it was more than the physical action,<br/>\nshe knew she wasn&#39;t going to get a present, she knew this was for the<br/>\nother kids, even Janene, who went as well, never once asked for a<br/>\npresent.  We did talk about it before hand, and we also stopped and got<br/>\na treat on the way home, but my expectation was that my children could<br/>\ndeal with this, and behold--they did!  (ok, sometimes this doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen, but most of the time it does).)  I think it comes down to<br/>\nthis--trusting ourselves and trusting our children, to learn, to grow,<br/>\nto be what they can be.  But sometimes, like the above, the world steps<br/>\nin and tells us and our children that we are not trustworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar told a story a long long time ago about being in a bead store and<br/>\nhow her daughter was told she couldn&#39;t touch the beads, and how Dar and<br/>\nher child left.  Her child was the customer and had a right, just as an<br/>\nadult, to examine what she was going to purchase before she did so.  I<br/>\nremember reading this story and thinking--I know her daughter, between<br/>\nthat child and myself, I&#39;d put the money on the child not spilling the<br/>\nbeads!  I&#39;m a clutz and tend to knock things down.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, ramble over.  I agree that it&#39;s nice to know that there are<br/>\nchildren, who, with their parent&#39;s permission, are reading this list.<br/>\nIt may help us to think twice about what we say, or don&#39;t say, and how<br/>\ncan that be a bad thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/22/01 7:12:07 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I HATE age discrimination. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most of it bugs me.
