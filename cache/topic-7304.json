I can ask when these <br/>\nmoments occur have you had your nap that day? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I learned something from another support group called HALT, <br/>\nit works for so many aspects of life. Hungry,Angry, Lonely and Tired. <br/>\nAll of which apply to a mother with young children on any given day <br/>\nof the week. The bottom line, when you are feeling irritable stop and <br/>\nallow yourself the luxury of checking in with your body. Are you <br/>\ntired? Has it been more than 4 hours since you have spoken with <br/>\nsomeone on your own adult level? When was the last time you met your <br/>\nphysical, emotional or spiritual needs? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can trace my every impatient moment back to one of these. Then too <br/>\nI read a book called positive parenting, can&#39;t remember off the top <br/>\nof my head who the author was, however, she talked about these <br/>\nmoments and called them, low energy moments. It was the first time I <br/>\nentertained the thought that just maybe i didn&#39;t have to be in a <br/>\nwonderful high energy mood all day long. Just acknowledging I felt <br/>\nlow allowed me to pull into myself like a turtle, speak as few as <br/>\nwords as necessary and just give myself time to turtle until my <br/>\nenergy level came back up or I had time to do something for myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo only have a few of these moments you are really doing great and <br/>\ntrust me when I say this is the most challenging task you will ever <br/>\nface however, no other success compares!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerly,<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7296,"nextTopicId":7301}}
