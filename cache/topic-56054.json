Not necessarily for the purpose of a bath , but the side effect of sitting in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-56437742\">Things we did with our son when he was younger that helped:<br/>\n<br/>\n~ A bath every day. Not necessarily for the purpose of &quot;a bath&quot;, but the side effect of sitting in a nice, warm bath and playing with toys was that the water was relaxing and playing with toys was relaxing. It was not uncommon for him to poop in the tub. We&#39;d drain the water, clean the tub, fill it back up and let him get back in for more play time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time he began to recognize that &quot;gotta poop&quot; feeling and would stand up quickly and ask to get on the toilet to poop, then he&#39;d get back in the tub and keep playing with toys. I&#39;d hang out in there with him the whole time he was in the tub, which was handy when he needed to go from tub to toilet *right now*. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ He didn&#39;t like wiping his bottom himself and I helped him with that for a lot of years. We used wet wipes (but don&#39;t flush them, not even the flushable ones, because they snag in sewer pipes!). Wet wipes are gentler on the bottom than toilet paper. When he reached the point where he was ready to start wiping his own bottom, he continued to use wet wipes. Then he switched over to t.p. eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ We kept a stool in the bathroom that he could prop his feet on so his feet weren&#39;t dangling (the original toilet in this house was very tall - I couldn&#39;t even get my feet flat on the floor while sitting on the toilet!). Being able to get a pretty good bend in the knees makes pooping more comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ We used one of the toilet seat inserts with handles so that he wouldn&#39;t have to work on keeping himself from falling into the toilet. He used that seat insert until he outgrew it, so it was definitely worthwhile to have around.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ To help him get in the habit of pooping regularly, we&#39;d take some books into the bathroom in the evenings and I&#39;d read them while he sat on the toilet. He wouldn&#39;t often poop during the reading-in-the-bathroom visits, but my purpose for those was to help him stop everything else and focus on his body for 10 or 15 minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it didn&#39;t appear to be helpful when he was younger (pooping in the bath worked best), as he&#39;s got older he&#39;s kept the routine of trying to poop every evening, so it actually did help in the longrun.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ If your son&#39;s anus hurts after pooping, you could wipe a small amount of diaper rash cream or Preparation-H Cooling Gel right around the anus. The Prep-H is very lubricant-y and can be wiped right up to the opening of the anus, helping smooth the way for those bigger poops to ease on out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] partnering with my child & toileting","postDate":"1279221425","msgId":56098,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyMTMwMy40MDEyOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDkubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMjA0OS41MDI5Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltZWNGVE5hRi1nUmdUbHlqaGo5Qm5hWk9nWEw0eTlpRmNraXJBNkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDUyNTQ1Ljc4ODIzLnFtQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDRDM0UzMUQ1LjcwMTA4MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDYwMjA0OS41MDI5Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":56097,"nextInTopic":56100,"prevInTime":56097,"nextInTime":56099,"topicId":56054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***What about using xylitol for baking and instead of sugar?*** This is off topic, but make sure you don t feed any leftovers to pets!

My eldest daughter did this from the age of 2 until the age of about 5.  It was stressful for me to see her so uncomfortable, and knowing she could end the discomfort by just &quot;doing&quot; it.  I spent a few years trying to encourage her to choose to move her bowels instead of holding on.  A few times she held it in so long she was plugged and was in terrible pain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found out that some children (herself included) often get diahrea from drinking too much apple juice.  I think that is what originally caused the whole problem, because she had diahrea so bad one night she was swimming in it, and we had to give her a bath.  She was disgusted.  Anyways, it was fear or disgust based, and the way I finally dealt with it was to realize there was nothing I could do to convince her...I just had to let go and trust she would get over it when she was ready.  Somehow accepting that fact took the stress away for me, and it all became easier.  I&#39;m sure she  sensed that I was less stressed as well, and it may have helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it ends soon<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] partnering with my child & toileting","postDate":"1279146745","msgId":56074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMjA0OS41MDI5Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDM0UzMUQ1LjcwMTA4MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltZWNGVE5hRi1nUmdUbHlqaGo5Qm5hWk9nWEw0eTlpRmNraXJBNkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDUyNTQ1Ljc4ODIzLnFtQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDRDM0UzMUQ1LjcwMTA4MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":56073,"nextInTopic":56079,"prevInTime":56073,"nextInTime":56075,"topicId":56054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam gave me an idea.

I&#39;m a new<br/>\nlist member, but have been glued to the list since I&#39;ve joined.  I love it!<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here&#39;s the sitch.  My 8yo son poops in his pants often.  As an infant,<br/>\nhe pooped only every few days (wholly breastfed, so I wasn&#39;t concerned) and<br/>\nhe&#39;s kept that habit through to now.  It concerns me now, obviously, since<br/>\nhe eats solid food and probably should be eliminating every day, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis pattern is that he&#39;ll hold it, hold, it, hold it, then it will start to<br/>\ncome out on it&#39;s own, because there is only so much room in ones body for<br/>\nfeces.

He&#39;s had to change his shorts/undies 3 to 4 times each day (on the<br/>\ndays that he&#39;ll take my suggestion to change, some days he will just say<br/>\nno).  For instance, the other day he had very stinky pants, he was very<br/>\nstinky, and he was outside playing with a couple neighborhood boys.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant anybody teasing him, or hurting his feelings, or shaming him, so of<br/>\ncourse, I ask him if I can help him clean up.  &quot;No&quot;  Then I say &quot;I can<br/>\nreally smell you and if I can smell you, your friends can probably smell<br/>\nyou, too&quot;  He doesn&#39;t seem to care, so out he goes to play.  I feel like I<br/>\nam doing a terrible job at taking care of him and protecting him.  This is<br/>\nmy biggest concern.  I can deal with washing poop clothes every day, I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t want him to be hurt.

(which will likely have positive effects on the whole situation,<br/>\nanyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nI could write a long time on this issue, but will stop here so that others<br/>\ncan ask questions which will then open up more discussion, or allow me to<br/>\nexpand on a point if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to read and help!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56081,"nextTopicId":56085}}
