Now, obviously, they weren&#39;t extincting *themselves,* they had just chosen not to have children for the sake of their cause and wanted to tell other people not to have kids either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I had a good laugh thinking about how much plastic they used for their canopy, table and banner.  How much paper were they using for their fliers?!  Did they drive there? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a family event, with lots of kids.  Lots of fun, good food, celebration and joy.  And here was this one bleak booth in the middle of it all- no celebration, no joy, just a black hole of doom and gloom.  As we were walking about, my 4 year old asked about their booth (she was asking about all of them).  I kind of dodged the question and moved on.  What was I supposed to say?  &quot;Oh, honey, those people think that you never should have been born, because the trees are more important.&quot;  Geez!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I do believe in taking care of the Earth, but it is also here for us to use *wisely*.  We should be good stewards of what we are given.  I don&#39;t use any chemical cleaners or body care products, I try to eat as much organic, locally grown food as I can, and I&#39;m starting my own organic garden this year.  Honestly, that is mostly about taking care of our bodies, not the earth, but I am glad that doing one has the side effect of helping the other.  I also recycle, use cloth bags, turn off lights and tv when they aren&#39;t in use, etc.  But I won&#39;t put any of those things over relationships.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Responding to plastic toy stuff","postDate":"1272484551","msgId":53559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzMTE2MS4zNDM0MC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzMTExMDAxLTExMUItNDYyMi1BOUE1LURGMzc5NTY0QjA5MUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":53557,"nextInTopic":53563,"prevInTime":53558,"nextInTime":53560,"topicId":53486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***For Quakers, it s less about making arguments than about expressing our own experiences and ideas, but even so, I d be glad to hear folks thoughts about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1124306821\">***For Quakers, it&#39;s less about making arguments than about expressing our own experiences and ideas, but even so, I&#39;d be glad to hear folks&#39; thoughts about what might be productive ways to speak about wanting a more inclusive, rather than exclusive, toy policy.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it is up to who funds the purchase of the toys and who actually gets put in charge of doing the purchasing.

All I could find were diatribes, as if he were a heretic.

Someone in my Quaker meeting said a few months ago, &quot;I know we all feel guilty about the resources we use as Americans...&quot; and I wanted to jump in and say, &quot;No, we don&#39;t.&quot; It&#39;s not to say I think these things don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just that whenever I try to look more deeply into a current issue like global warming, I end up feeling _less_ sure about what I should think or what should be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Responding to plastic toy stuff","postDate":"1272481971","msgId":53553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMTExMDAxLTExMUItNDYyMi1BOUE1LURGMzc5NTY0QjA5MUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDczNjdDNjEyLTAyNEItNDg0OS04QkY2LTFBQ0E5QjREQjk1M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":53549,"nextInTopic":53554,"prevInTime":53552,"nextInTime":53554,"topicId":53486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra s post about what a terrible person she is for having that can of spray deodorant reminded me of something I may have to (or rather, choose to) deal","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1898424702\">Sandra&#39;s post about what a terrible person she is for having that can of spray deodorant reminded me of something I may have to (or rather, choose to) deal with soon (being a terrible person myself):<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Quaker meeting has just build a new meetinghouse. For 40 years, we&#39;ve rented space from churches, and used, for instance, their nurseries for baby and toddler care during worship, meaning an assortment of wooden and plastic toys. A few weeks ago, another mom in my meeting mentioned casually that she hopes we&#39;ll have a &quot;no plastic toys&quot; rule in the new meetinghouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of reactions to this. Many Quaker parents I know are on the perfection-parenting kick: no sugar, no TV, no &quot;violent&quot; play. This particular mom has a huge playroom in her house that looks like a Montessori classroom, I kid you not.  I find this irritating, but you know, I&#39;m kind of irritable and I don&#39;t generally care to argue about it. They get to make choices about their kids just like I get to make choices about mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it does come up in business meeting and we get to talking about policies, I would like to express my discomfort with a no-plastic-toys-allowed policy. It&#39;s partly just that I think it&#39;s this parenting from fear, that plastic is so very bad that it will ruin our kids. Partly I think it&#39;s nostalgia for a false golden age when children had fewer toys and they were simpler and made of wood and thus they were free to truly use their imagination. Partly I think it&#39;s a kind of snobbery that sets up a barrier to some families feeling comfortable at our meeting. But I feel like I get tongue-tied trying to express these things. For Quakers, it&#39;s less about making arguments than about expressing our own experiences and ideas, but even so, I&#39;d be glad to hear folks&#39; thoughts about what might be productive ways to speak about wanting a more inclusive, rather than exclusive, toy policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151979431,"authorName":"Rebecca M.","from":"&quot;Rebecca M.&quot; &lt;ackirebecci@...&gt;","profile":"ackirebecci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What is  E^3 or peak aware?","postDate":"1272480930","msgId":53549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyYTBiMiszdnB0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERFODZFNTRGLUQxM0QtNDBGMy1BMUZGLUNDMzYyRjE2RkIyMkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":53546,"nextInTopic":53553,"prevInTime":53548,"nextInTime":53550,"topicId":53486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Resources are not infinite, however. So eventually the resources that the species have adapted to start to become scarce and the growth of the species either slows to a more manageable number or there&#39;s a quick die off of a large number of the species.

I saw something today (FB<br/>\nad) about &quot;fighting climate change&quot;... ok but these things go in cycles and<br/>\nthey&#39;re natural (for the most part, IMO). Why fight something like that? It<br/>\nmakes more sense to adapt. I was hoping that climate change policies would<br/>\nbe about adaptation not stopping climate change from happening at all. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic. And learning things that are &quot;back to nature&quot;<br/>\nis a fine way to try to prepare for change if a person wants to.

The  <br/>\n&gt; thing is, what&#39;s the value of higher education? Isn&#39;t part of the  <br/>\n&gt; point that theoretical and applied higher education have taken us  <br/>\n&gt; down this road of modern society and brought us to the brink of  <br/>\n&gt; descent?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t E^3 or peak aware when I started homeschooling 12 years  <br/>\n&gt; ago, but I already knew that I wasn&#39;t going to lock my kids into a  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;higher education&quot; path and perpetuate the idea that official,  <br/>\n&gt; intellectual knowledge was the ultimate goal. My argument has always  <br/>\n&gt; been, &quot;What if they want to throw pots in Sedona?&quot; Do they need  <br/>\n&gt; higher education for that, or would they be better served on a  <br/>\n&gt; different path? (Someone once thought I said &quot;grow pot in Sedona&quot;!)  <br/>\n&gt; If they want to pursue a path via higher education, I want them to  <br/>\n&gt; be able to do that too - so as a homeschooler I want to leave the  <br/>\n&gt; doors open and make sure my kids are pursuing the path of their  <br/>\n&gt; choosing, not the path of society&#39;s choosing or of mine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that I am E^3 or peak aware, being at the pinnacle of formalized  <br/>\n&gt; education seems even more obsolete. Not that knowledge and skills,  <br/>\n&gt; science and technology are no longer valuable, but we need a million  <br/>\n&gt; farmers and right now we have going on two million lawyers.  <br/>\n&gt; Somewhere along the path of descent, we need to get the value of  <br/>\n&gt; higher education properly integrated with the value of all the other  <br/>\n&gt; important paths. I&#39;m still working hard to keep the doors open for  <br/>\n&gt; my kids, but I have the sense that the pot-throwers (and maybe the  <br/>\n&gt; pot-growers!) might win the day...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53694,"nextTopicId":53706}}
