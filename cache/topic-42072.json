I spoke with a man from Mexico who was  <br/>\nstaying in a hotel in Minnesota where Holly and I were, and the  <br/>\nTraaseths, last year or so and he and I were at the public computers  <br/>\nearly in the morning.  He was e-mailing home, and was 24 or so.  He  <br/>\nwas talking to me about it seeming cold that Americans push their  <br/>\nchildren out of the house and rush them to be on their own.  His  <br/>\nfamily was helping him financially and emotionally and physically, and  <br/>\nhis girlfriend was living with his parents while he was working with a  <br/>\ncrew on various projects here and there to make money.

What I learned from La Leche League (and specifically from  <br/>\nthe words and attitudes of Carol Rice-McClure and Lori Odhner, and  <br/>\nKathy Hoag (now Kathy Isaacson)  was that for Kirby to be happy, he  <br/>\nneeded a mom who was gentle and attentive and was listening to him,  <br/>\neven before he could talk.  For me to be happy, I needed to be the  <br/>\nkind of mom Kirby needed right then, in each moment.

We registered to homeschool,  <br/>\nfiguring that when he was six we could either put him in kindergarten,  <br/>\nor first, or keep homeschooling.   Each year we asked him.  We thought  <br/>\nMarty would probably want to go to school, even if Kirby wasn&#39;t.  We  <br/>\nhad the right to make those options available to them not because we  <br/>\ndecided we were radical unschoolers (all we were doing at first was  <br/>\nletting one child be home instead of sending him to school), but  <br/>\nbecause the state laws allowed for it, and we took an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty was old enough, he wanted to stay home too.<br/>\nWhen Holly was old enough, she wanted to stay home too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe gave them choices within what was safe and legal, and then we made  <br/>\nthe best of the situation by really unschooling as well as we could.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":121442839,"authorName":"Susan Reeve","from":"Susan Reeve &lt;ksreeve@...&gt;","profile":"ksreeve","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Help!

Sorry this is going to take many words but WE <br/>\nneed Help!<br/>\nMy name is Kara, I&#39;m married for 17 years and we have 3 children. We <br/>\nlive in Memphis which has a very troubled school system.  We&#39;ve been <br/>\nlucky to have our children at the University school for Elementary <br/>\nschool.  Our Daughter  is now in 10th grade in an optional program.  <br/>\nOptional programs are small sub- programs within the public schools.  <br/>\nTo get into an optional program you must qualify, usally with an A- B <br/>\naverage and scores in the 80th percentile in reading and Math on the <br/>\nNational tests. My daughter qualified and she &quot;fits&quot; the system, as <br/>\nin: school is important to her, getting good grades.....and so forth. <br/>\nMy youngest is still in Elementary and although he qualifies for the <br/>\noptional program in our district there are only 20 available openings <br/>\nnow for middle school and probably a couple hundred trying to get in. <br/>\nIf one is to attend public school in Memphis, one prefers the <br/>\noptional, it is safer, more organized, and the kids in the program <br/>\nenjoy school and are committed, and the program offers a wide variety <br/>\nof learning opportunities.<br/>\nMy Middle son is the reason why I write.  He missed the qualification <br/>\nfor the optional program by only a few points, and there are no <br/>\nexceptions.  We placed him in a catholic school because it was a <br/>\nprivate school we could afford and he knew several children <br/>\nattending, the regular public program was not an option for us at the <br/>\ntime because of the dangerous setting (weapons and violence in the <br/>\nschools other discipline problems). We hoped it would be an easy <br/>\ntransition.  <br/>\nIt has been anything but easy.  My child went from a well liked by <br/>\nthe teachers, never in trouble&quot;  A, B student to a student who is <br/>\nconstantly getting in trouble for ridiculous things, and <br/>\nflunking....Now the school wants us to test him for ADHD.... I feel <br/>\nlike the school should be tested for abuse and neglect.... but <br/>\ngetting back on point.. I&#39;ve seen enough documentaries now on the <br/>\npush to test and drug children that it scares the H--- out of me.  <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t believe this is the case with my child anyway.  Why would <br/>\nthis show up suddenly when he turns 13.  I think that the experience <br/>\nof going to a highly structured, program where everything is learned <br/>\nthrough strict memorization, there is little time for physical <br/>\nactivity, and socializing and punishment for things like dropping <br/>\nyour pencil on the ground has caused him to lose all motivation for <br/>\nschool.  My Husband and I are very relaxed in our parenting, we <br/>\nrarely punish, All I have ever cared about is my children&#39;s honesty.<br/>\nOur son, I will admit, is a dreamer, an artist like myself. When we <br/>\nlike something we are a genius in the field, when we don&#39;t have an <br/>\ninterest we have no desire to pursue it or try.  I was not interested <br/>\nin school as a child, but I had many interests, and I did  very well <br/>\nin the things I liked, Just like my son.<br/>\nSince this awful school experience, we see our son responding with <br/>\nanger, frustration, lack of motivation, and withdrawal, all things <br/>\nthat break my heart.  All I want is for my children to be Happy, to <br/>\nfeel joy in their heart and this school year for him has been only <br/>\none struggle after another.<br/>\nI&#39;ve started investigating other possibilities, and I came across <br/>\nUnschooling.  My son has been asking for a couple of months now to be <br/>\nhomeschooled,  but I have been afraid that I can&#39;t help him like he <br/>\nwill need in academics, or he will not have the motivation necessary <br/>\nto stick with it.  My husband being a College professor with a DR in <br/>\nNeuro- Biology feels very strong about College education for his <br/>\nkids.. I am not as opinionated.<br/>\nSeeing the change in him with lack of motivation, and now frustration <br/>\nand anger,  I am also afraid to give him the responsibility that <br/>\nunschooling requires.  Then there are the laws about truancy....<br/>\nHe has already stated that when he turns 16 he is dropping out.<br/>\nI do not have the unschooled mindset yet, but I do have a bone to <br/>\npick with public education and our American education system in <br/>\ngeneral.  It is Authoritarian, it is turning our kids into mind <br/>\ncontrolled robots, who are told what to do and how to think, who are <br/>\nfed information that serves little, useless facts that are forgotten <br/>\nsoon after the test....<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m looking for ideas, facts, similar experiences and actions <br/>\ntaken.  And resources on how Unschooling works.  I know there are a <br/>\nlot of homeschoolers here in Memphis, but I am not interested in a <br/>\nReligious affiliation. Homeschooling in Memphis is all associated <br/>\nwith Christianity.  My philosophy is more in line with Zen Buddhism <br/>\nalthough I am not part of any religious organization.<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nI look forward to all responses!<br/>\n<br/>\nKara,<br/>\n<br/>\noh and I am not familiar with all the abbreviations used in this <br/>\nforum, maybe someone can fill me in.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42295,"nextTopicId":42254}}
