I don’t.  I can’t be in the room when someone else is using nailclippers.  It’s different if it’s me, or they’re doing it to me—still not good, but not full-nervous-system painful.  What some people get with chalk on a chalkboard (rarer now than it once was) or someone squeaking the outside of a balloon, I get from nail clippers.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nWhat helps me, for me is to ONLY clip mine when I’m just out of a bath or shower (hot tub, when ours worked—poor wooden hot tub gave up in the New Mexico dry heat after eight years—a good run.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nFor hand, I soak one hand for about five minutes in warm water and then cut those nails.  Then I soak the other hand.  If I do both at once, the sound starts to bother me before I finish.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nMaybe consider doing the one worst toenail, after a warm soak, and see how he handles that.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nAnother different idea is to take him to a pedicure shop—not to have his done, but to see you (and maybe his dad) have yours done by a professional.  If it seems interesting and not scary to watch, maybe he would let you play that at home for him.  Or maybe he would be willing to let the pedicure professionals do his another time.  I wouldn’t press him to do it right then, but give him time to think.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nYour husband is right, about the neglect.  There are things parents can’t leave alone.  Ingrown toenails can be bad, and shoes are required lots of places, and you can’t say to any social worker or judge “Well, we’re unschoolers, and didn’t want to take away his choice.”<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n-=-We really want to respect his body autonomy and wouldn&#39;t ever force it because of his rights-=-<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nSomewhere (and not in this discussion, I don’t think) you’ve picked up slogans or “truths” that aren’t true.  And cutting a child’s nails isn’t “force” and shouldn’t be trauma, unless you have layered it in “rights” and “body autonomy” that are slogans and not real “rights.”<br clear=\"none\">\n<br

I don’t.  I can’t be in the room when someone else is using nailclippers.  It’s different if it’s me, or they’re doing it to me—still not good, but not full-nervous-system painful.

I wouldn’t press him to do it right then, but give him time to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband is right, about the neglect.  There are things parents can’t leave alone.

Currently our previously social and outdoorsy loving little boy is now playing Minecraft from Morning to night but we are trying to go with it, keep connection and trust him but we are finding it hard!)<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">Anyway! What I actually wanted to ask you and the group please is this :-<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">Our little lad is 5 this month. Recently he has an aversion to trimming his nails. We have gone with it for the past couple of months - we have offered to do it but also to help him to do it himself. He says he is scared because it hurts. He agreed that we could do it while he was asleep which we tried twice but he woke and declined it as said he was scared and it hurts. <br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">The only reason this is now a concern is because his feet are hurting because his nails are growing very long and curling into his own toes!! My husband last night said we are neglecting him and we were both so upset. <br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">We really want to respect his body autonomy and wouldn&#39;t ever force it because of his rights and the trauma, but at the same time we have tried talking to him about keeping his feet healthy and explaining that if we/he tried it he may see that it doesn&#39;t actually hurt. <br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">However I am aware that to him, he IS scared and it actually may hurt because the tension in anticipation of us doing it must be awful. <br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">We have offered him to do it using scissors, various clippers and even biting them off with his teeth!<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">Just feeling a little stuck now as they are now not growing well. It has been quite a few months <img alt=\"&#x00d83d;&#x00de2c;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425_1ift ygrps-yiv-425543425_2560 ygrps-yiv-425543425img\" style=\"border:0px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 1px;\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425CBD40E1A-8063-4AF0-A057-F262BC0BF191\" src=\"cid:2DEE2E92-C43B-4811-899C-2E2998C29649@PK5001Z\"> Do we wait until he can&#39;t put his shoes on because of pain? This just doesn&#39;t feel right either! I think we need some suggestions that we may not have thought of. <br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-425543425\">Many thanks for your help.</html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77928,"nextTopicId":77952}}
