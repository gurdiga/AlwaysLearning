The topic was forensic <br/>\narchaeology and was geared for elementary aged children. The speaker was <br/>\nvery good and began to talk about how they would make guesses about what <br/>\nhappened to the person who died.  My daughter piped up with how Buddy on <br/>\nDinosaur Train called a guess a hypothesis.  A little boy who was about <br/>\na year younger (who we didn&#39;t know) piped up and said that he saw that <br/>\nshow too and that after the hypothesis they would try to prove it.  The <br/>\nspeaker was just thrilled that they understood what she was talking <br/>\nabout and could make the connection.  The two childern were pleased to <br/>\nadd something to the conversation.  All because of a common TV show <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed watching it unfold.  Thanks for letting me share.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargo</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71656,"nextTopicId":71702}}
