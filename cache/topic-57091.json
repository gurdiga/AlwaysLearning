They&#39;ve <br/>\nalways been pretty happy listening for an hour or so, even when they <br/>\nwere young - maybe after 6 or 7 years old. We also went on tours with <br/>\ndocents. But - we always bailed if it wasn&#39;t well done - except one time <br/>\nI remember we got stuck in an awfully boring observatory talk at a local <br/>\ncollege - we couldn&#39;t get out because it was pitch dark and we would <br/>\nhave had to climb over lots of people to get out. When the lights came <br/>\non - 3/4 of the audience had slipped away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut- anyway - lectures always sounded like fun to them because I had <br/>\nalways pretty much found ones that I thought would be fun and steered <br/>\naway from ones I thought would be boring.   We went to see some of their <br/>\nfavorite book authors speak - Brian Jaques (Redwall books) was <br/>\nfantastic, for example.  We also saw Jim Weiss tell stories, but also <br/>\ntalk about storytelling, a few times. The kids were big fans, so that <br/>\nwas fun for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - my kids actually had a lot of experience of sitting in a group or <br/>\naudience and &quot;listening.&quot; But never was it like school - they always had <br/>\nthe choice to slip out and there were no tests or anything like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was the first day of college for Rosie and first day of grad <br/>\nschool for Roya. Both called me all excited about their classes. Roya is <br/>\ngetting a degree in counseling and she said they did all kinds of <br/>\nice-breaking games. Rosie has a deaf teacher for two of her classes - he <br/>\nhas an interpreter in one class and not in the other (where students are <br/>\nsupposed to know how to sign).  Rox is in the middle of summer school at <br/>\nher university - tomorrow her &quot;History of Cuisine&quot; class is cooking <br/>\ntogether - she is making ratatouille.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege, at least, can be a lot more than sitting and listening to <br/>\nboring lectures, taking tests, and getting grades. These days with <br/>\nwebsites like &quot;RateMyProfessor&quot; students can be more selective, too, <br/>\nabout their teachers.   But most students come into college with really <br/>\nnegative feelings about school and it makes it even more difficult for <br/>\nthem to find and appreciate the cool side of it. Unschooled kids can, if <br/>\nthey decide to, tolerate the boring stuff in order to get the cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about classes","postDate":"1283222411","msgId":57112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0QjJFMDlBQzNDNDQxM0VCMjA3ODI4Qzk4M0YzQkQ2QEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NjAwNi42MTM2Mi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAxODEwMWNiNDcxZSQzMjM2NDcwMCQ5NmEyZDUwMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDwzMDFGODUyMC05MjJELTRFODItODI1Ri04MjI5RTZDOUFGMENAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+IDxERDQyNDgyOC1EOEI3LTRDMzAtOUZDOC1GNkI0NzBBMEE0M0FAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxDRUVFNUUyNzBENkQ0MjRGQkJGRTBDOTZGMjFEMTVBQUBMeWxhUEM+IDw2ODYwMDYuNjEzNjIucW1Ad2ViODE1MDMubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57103,"nextInTopic":57114,"prevInTime":57111,"nextInTime":57113,"topicId":57091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"oh for sure - my daughter did classes when she wanted (and tae kwon do was one of them - for years, til she got her black belt), before she started school","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1931963989\">oh for sure - my daughter did classes when she wanted (and tae kwon do was one of them - for years, til she got her black belt), before she started school (dance and tumbling) and during the time she was in school too.  my son, not so much.  he did tae kwon do/jujitsu for a couple years, but other than that had no interest in classes - from before he was in school, more based on his temperament.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: BRIAN POLIKOWSKY <br/>\nSent: Monday, August 30, 2010 2:13 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about classes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nMaybe Lyla&#39;s kids would have been OK with doing classes when they were younger <br/>\nif they been unschooled all their lives, maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about classes","postDate":"1283202818","msgId":57103,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NjAwNi42MTM2Mi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENFRUU1RTI3MEQ2RDQyNEZCQkZFMEM5NkYyMUQxNUFBQEx5bGFQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxODEwMWNiNDcxZSQzMjM2NDcwMCQ5NmEyZDUwMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDwzMDFGODUyMC05MjJELTRFODItODI1Ri04MjI5RTZDOUFGMENAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+IDxERDQyNDgyOC1EOEI3LTRDMzAtOUZDOC1GNkI0NzBBMEE0M0FAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxDRUVFNUUyNzBENkQ0MjRGQkJGRTBDOTZGMjFEMTVBQUBMeWxhUEM+"},"prevInTopic":57100,"nextInTopic":57112,"prevInTime":57102,"nextInTime":57104,"topicId":57091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe Lyla s kids would have been OK with doing classes when they were younger if they been unschooled all their lives, maybe not.

classes at our local home education resource center, but opted out at the last minute and I think he was right to do so - still it wasn&#39;t math or science - it was more anthropological/discussion based classes.  but too didactic for him, to get nearly as much out of them, as he would get out of, say, a conversation at home, or with a friend, or from a book.  he has recently started reading &quot;people&#39;s history of the world&quot; on his own, as well as huff post articles, and science news magazines, and he talks about and explores things he&#39;s read with us.  that&#39;s one kid, with his unique questions and ideas getting to  have 2 parents as a sounding board for ideas - much much different than a class, with structure, and external expectations from a &quot;teacher&quot; to whom he&#39;s not connected and a bunch of other kids whose parents might have other ideas about the reasons their kids are there, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nmy daughter is old enough now  (15) to do adult activities and to not have to experience the adult teacher - child student divide that has long driven her crazy.  so she&#39;s just enrolled in an acrobatics/trapeze class she&#39;s excited about, and last year she took a community college psychology class, in which she revealed her age on the last day as part of her final presentation.    unfortunately, the community college requires students under 16 to get instructor permission for every class in which they wish to enroll, and many instructors will not give it   so she&#39;s decided to wait til she&#39;s 16 to explore more CC classes.   she has been learning spanish with rosetta stone at home, in anticipation of her trip to south america with other unschoolers this winter, and also is always working on a novel - when she finishes one, she starts another.  the classes available to her would be *limiting* of her interests and activities, not expanding, so she&#39;s got even less interest in home school &quot;schools&quot; than my son, who has almost none   <br/>\n<br/>\nthat makes my kids sound really busy and accomplished, but from an outside view, without an unschooler&#39;s eye, they&#39;d probably look just the opposite.  &quot;learning&quot; 6 hours a day  in school, though, is really just being taught for maybe a couple hours (70 minutes average of instruction time, I read) and  not necessarily learning much of anything.  when we really recognize how our kids are learning every moment, even when they&#39;re not learning spanish or writing a novel or reading about history or science, that&#39;s when unschooling really clicks, in my experience.

Its like 2-3 <br/>\ntimes a month for<br/>\n3 hours. He does not need to go every time and sometimes he chooses to stay <br/>\nhome.<br/>\nHe has done Taekwon Do, basketball, programs with other homeschoolers at nature <br/>\ncenters,<br/>\nsome with his cub scout  den ( just did some astronomy class last week).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe gets to decide if he wants to do them and I tell him what it is all going to <br/>\nbe about.<br/>\nSome he does , like the co-op and cub scout, with his group of friends and more <br/>\nfor being with them.<br/>\nWe also do many other things to fulfill his need of being with his friends.<br/>\nThis is a kid that learned to read without any classes or anyone &quot;teaching &quot; <br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe feels very confident about himself and that he can learn.<br/>\nMy nephew went to pre-school, kindergarten and a couple of months of 1st grade.<br/>\nIt was a disaster and he is still healing from all of it. Going to any kind of <br/>\nclasses is the last thing he<br/>\nwanted for a long time. He just started asking for Karate classes after almost a <br/>\nyear of homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are much more likely to go to a program where they offer to talk about the <br/>\nhistory of something like this one:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot; EVENT DESCRIPTION: A 90-minute narrated cruise on the Minneapolis Queen, a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 78-foot state-of-the-art replica paddlewheeler, as it travels through historic <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; downtown Minneapolis and the *Upper Saint Anthony Falls Lock and Dam.* We <br/>\n&gt;depart <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; from Boom Island Park in the heart of the historic Minneapolis Riverfront <br/>\n&gt; District. &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may interest my kid and it may not. IT would be fun just  go  for the sites <br/>\nand the paddle boat. Best if you are not going with the expectations that<br/>\nthey will learning history of anything. Go for the fun and opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to see the replicas of Pinta and Nina , two of the caravels of <br/>\nChristopher Columbus . We talked a little about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI answered any questions. My son read some of the signs and listen to a crew <br/>\nmember talk about <br/>\n<br/>\nhow it must have been to cross the Atlantic in those small boats carrying even <br/>\nhorses in it!<br/>\nNo expectations. All about fun. I wanted to see them as they were made in Brazil <br/>\nand one was used in the movie 1492: Conquest of Paradise by Ridley Scott.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I learned a lot of things I did not know at all. Like Santa Maria ran <br/>\naground in her fist trip and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a really nice group of homeschooling parents and kids that are trying to <br/>\nput together a co-op. I have a vision and a couple of parents  have the vision <br/>\nof history classes. They have said that the kids will have to sit down for 30 <br/>\nminutes to show respect to whoever prepared the classes. I have told them my <br/>\nposition and that if my son wants to sit he will but if he does not he can <br/>\nchoose not to.<br/>\nI have gotten an e-mail going on and on about how we must teach our kids to <br/>\nlisten even if they do not want to.<br/>\nHere is what it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot; We need to teach that even if you are not fully interested you need to<br/>\nrespect other peoples ideas or thoughts and this is a great way of doing so,<br/>\nIt&#39;s not asking alot of any individual and for someone who puts any work into<br/>\npreparing a presentation it will have a great effect if everyone is respectful<br/>\nenough to listen to thier ideas, to not do so is teaching our children that only<br/>\nthier ideas warrent merit and this will be adverse to them as young adults<br/>\nmoving into the workplace, or college, or ever relationships with others.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was all because I said if a &quot;class&quot; was offered my son could pick and <br/>\nchoose if he wanted to <br/>\n<br/>\nattend. I also said we should have other activities for kids not interested or <br/>\ntoo young for whatever was offered that day.<br/>\nThis parent wanted commitment that all kids should just go to all classes <br/>\noffered and sit down and listen.<br/>\nAs you can see it may be hard to make it work with such a diverse group.<br/>\nA couple of parents also do not consider programs like the one above as <br/>\neducational enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got cut out for talking about Field Trips to State Parks and Nature Centers.<br/>\nEven those we only go if we are interested and think we will enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent the group many links about how children learn best and best learning <br/>\nenvironments , not uschooling links.<br/>\nI hope people take the time to read it but since I heard this parents , that <br/>\nused to call themselves unschoolers, have apparently<br/>\ndecided to follow &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot; I don&#39;t think they will.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another link that helps people understand that teaching is not the same <br/>\nas learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teaching/\">http://sandradodd.com/teaching/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about classes","postDate":"1283171982","msgId":57094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERENDI0ODI4LUQ4QjctNEMzMC05RkM4LUY2QjQ3MEEwQTQzQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwMUY4NTIwLTkyMkQtNEU4Mi04MjVGLTgyMjlFNkM5QUYwQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxODEwMWNiNDcxZSQzMjM2NDcwMCQ5NmEyZDUwMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDwzMDFGODUyMC05MjJELTRFODItODI1Ri04MjI5RTZDOUFGMENAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":57092,"nextInTopic":57095,"prevInTime":57093,"nextInTime":57095,"topicId":57091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Bottom line is if the child enjoys the class, has the option of not going, has other ways to explore an interest -- though in some cases like martial arts","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-214774852\">-=-Bottom line is if the child enjoys the class, has the option of not<br/>\ngoing, has other ways to explore an interest -- though in some cases<br/>\nlike martial arts and ceramics a class is probably the best option --<br/>\nthen they fit in just fine with unschooling.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s good for older kids, but not so much for younger ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy wrote something about this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/kellylovejoy/stages\">http://sandradodd.com/kellylovejoy/stages</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Joyce that there are unschoolers who think we&#39;re crazy  <br/>\nhere; that&#39;s why this is called &quot;radical unschooling,&quot; and some others  <br/>\nsay &quot;unschooling&quot; and put their kids in classes, or teach them math or  <br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about classes","postDate":"1283171083","msgId":57095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENFMUM4MThFLTMzQ0YtNDFGQi05RjkzLTk0MTU1OTU2NzY3QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxODEwMWNiNDcxZSQzMjM2NDcwMCQ5NmEyZDUwMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAxODEwMWNiNDcxZSQzMjM2NDcwMCQ5NmEyZDUwMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":57094,"nextInTopic":57096,"prevInTime":57094,"nextInTime":57096,"topicId":57091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I have a question about classes.
