Guide dogs decided to take the puppy away from the family that<br/>\nwas raising him.  He is at the kennels in California, being evaluated.  The<br/>\nfamily was very angry about the way that GD handled the situation and has<br/>\nstated that they will never have anything to do with GD again.  This leaves<br/>\nthe local puppy raising club with only 1 pup, being raised by the leader of<br/>\nthe club.  She has been told she will have to disband the club and transfer<br/>\nher pup, because there can&#39;t be a club with fewer than 3 pups.  The nearest<br/>\nclub is an hour away, on a route that is often icy and hazardous in the<br/>\nwinter.  The leader said that if my daughter were to get a pup, they might<br/>\nallow the club to continue.  However, we are not ready to get a pup yet.  I<br/>\nfeel we have a lot to learn before we commit to that and Lisa has also said<br/>\nthat she isn&#39;t ready.
