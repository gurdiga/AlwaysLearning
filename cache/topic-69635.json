Some of you might have or know older unschoolers who might want to travel and visit, and do some work that could go on a resume.  They&#39;re not &quot;jobs&quot; in the making money way, but they&#39;re ways to get experience for applying for other jobs later.  And they&#39;re opportunities to live other places for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you might have projects or situations you want to add to that data base, too, to host an unschooler.  Those who live far from other families might want to borrow an experienced unschooler for a while. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blakeboles.com/the-grown-unschooler-opportunity-network/\">http://www.blakeboles.com/the-grown-unschooler-opportunity-network/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s what Blake wrote about it the idea of these opportunities:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blakeboles.com/2012/06/proposition-a-grown-unschooler-opportunity-network/\">http://www.blakeboles.com/2012/06/proposition-a-grown-unschooler-opportunity-network/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69623,"nextTopicId":69636}}
