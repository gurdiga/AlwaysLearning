Please eat a<br/>\npiece of cake now.  The other kids not used to all that candy, cake and<br/>\ncookies had to be ordered to enjoy the fruit.  My neice who was always<br/>\nencouraged to eat high fat food was in Heaven with all you can eat fruits<br/>\nand veggies.

It asks for mindfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought that a lot of cleaning can be simplified, when read the first<br/>\npost on this thread, and reading that list gave me some ideas.  For instance<br/>\nI am seriously thinking of serving most our meals off disposable plates or<br/>\nwith napkins.  I hate chasing dishes all over the house.  I want the kids to<br/>\nenjoy food and to be well nourished and have autonomy.   People will blanch<br/>\nI am sure, but we try to have a low carbon footprint, and for my family just<br/>\nbeing able to put paper plates in a green bin to be composted will work so<br/>\nmuch better than having dirty plates everywhere.  When I read Su&#39;s list I<br/>\nrealized that paper plates would meet my kids autonomy, have peace in our<br/>\nfamily and simplify chores, somewhat!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Partners rather than adversaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra I totally loves this sentiment and Su&#39;s list!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nine year old son learned to make meringues this weekend.  He had been<br/>\nwanting to do this for a long time, too.  At least a month or so.  I was<br/>\ndoubtful as I had never done it before, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to *offer* my<br/>\nexperience. I caught myself trying to talk him into baking another treat,<br/>\nlike peanut butter cookies or a fruit pie.<br/>\n<br/>\nUndaunted, Martin hunted an easy recipe on the Net.  He wrote down the<br/>\ningredients:  sugar, cream of tarter, egg whites and vanilla.  He took his<br/>\ndad shopping for them.  He asked me if I could help him.  So I was in the<br/>\nkitchen on standby, ignoring my doubts.  Before I knew it he was beating a<br/>\nwhite mixture in a bowl and was dropping it from a spoon on to a cookie<br/>\nsheet, and baking them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expected it to be hard, and worried he would be disappointed that I<br/>\nthought about dissuading him.  I was so surprised he succeeded.  Yes, I know<br/>\nhow that reads, but I am being honest!  I have learned to overcome the urge<br/>\nto stop my kids from doing their own thing but am always so surprised it<br/>\nworks.  My parents were constantly talking me out of projects, or throwing<br/>\nobstacles at me, and then pointing out how I should have listened when<br/>\nwhatever I was attempting failed.  I still have a fear of failure that I am<br/>\ntrying to overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed he cleaned up as he went, rinsing things.  The next day all his<br/>\n&quot;tools&quot; were ready for another batch.  Again, I worry about telling this<br/>\nstory on other lists because I am going to hear that my family is eating too<br/>\nmuch sugar daily and I am celebrating this as Martin&#39;s baking project.  I<br/>\nwas able to just tell him how pretty they looked, and how I appreciate him<br/>\nfor making them.  No condescension about how he did it all by himself or<br/>\nwhatever.  He was really proud and happy.  I was really happy for him, and<br/>\nexcited we were able to work together.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually when we bake cookies, pie or cake I end up cleaning up. This is fine<br/>\nwith me, but it was interesting to watch him clean.  I didn&#39;t comment on it,<br/>\nas I didn&#39;t want to turn into The Fun-Killer/ Joy stopper.  My SIL coined<br/>\nthese terms to describe adults who see a child enjoying an activity who<br/>\nswoop in and turn it into a quiz. or lavish praise on it which takes the fun<br/>\nout of it with the hopes that they are &quot;positively reinforcing&quot; the event.<br/>\nIE a kid calculating sales tax, or figuring out how to spend his allowance<br/>\nand suddenly an adult turns it into a math quiz.

We know someone like this too.  Her daughter ran away from home.<br/>\nShe insists she knows her daughter best.  She bases this on the fact<br/>\nthat they talk about things.  It&#39;s just the 2 of them, so I&#39;m sure that<br/>\nthey talk about things.  However, what I see, is that the daughter<br/>\nreally can&#39;t talk about her true feelings, she has to gaurd herself and<br/>\nphrase things in such a way that her mom will accept and agree with. <br/>\nI&#39;ve been there done that with my own mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all accounts we had a decent relationship.

The reaction of most<br/>\ntraditionally minded parents is to control those thoughts of their kids,<br/>\nto force those thoughts to conform to their own ideals of what they<br/>\nbelieve their kids should be thinking and feeling.  This is largely why<br/>\nparents suddenly end up with teens that they perceive as being<br/>\nrebellious.  At some point, in order for a teen with ideas that don&#39;t<br/>\nmesh with their parents, to get what they want, they will have to make<br/>\ntheir parents lose.  It becomes a battle of whose will is stronger, who<br/>\nwill win that battle.  Some kids give up trying until they leave the<br/>\nhome and never return, or wait years to talk to their parents honestly,<br/>\nif ever.

She is a very gentle and connected mother in many ways.<br/>\nShe is also a very intelligent person BUT she parents in many ways with FEAR. She does not see it as so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer kids are severely limited on what they can eat. She has even put her oldest on a diet when he was 5-6. He is a husky boy.<br/>\nThe parents are overweight ( heck I am too). They are very afraid their kids are going to become obese. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday they came over and my son wanted to show some video games to her son. They have known each other since they were babies. Her son told my son  he could not because his mom won&#39;t let him. So my son went to ask her why.<br/>\nHe just could not understand. I later explained to him how some parents raise their kids diferent than in our home.<br/>\nShe does not even know anything about video games. She is afraid it will make them violent or make them fat from sitting all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids used to be able to watch TV for 30 minutes a day but now they don&#39;t have TV only movies and those are extremely<br/>\nrestricted. Even Madagascar was deemed too violent when they saw it.<br/>\nAgain it is because she fears TV will corrupt their brains and turn them to mush. TV is a waiste of time they should be reading a book.She cannot see how much they could be learing from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I offer some cut up watermelon I had for the kids while we played in the yard. The oldest asked me what else I had for them to eat. He knows we have yummy stuff that he can only eat when here. Very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also don&#39;t play in the computer. Not allowed yet to do that. Children should be playing outside or doing crafts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I was going to make is that she knows her son better. If she would let him eat whatever he wanted and how much he wanted he would not stop eating and only eat &quot;junk&quot; and lots. But what she can&#39;t see is that she created that.<br/>\nSo does mommy really knows best in that case?<br/>\nShe does and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Cleaning Evolution...part 1 of ?","postDate":"1243782699","msgId":45622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjFFNUI1LTQwQjQtNDE1Ni1CQkE1LUQxREE3ODM2RjdBMEBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERGNEQ5MjdFLTZERDgtNDQzOS1CNTM3LTg4RjM5MkU5MUZGM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM4MzdERjBELTNCQzAtNDg3OS1CMjk1LUIzMDQ3OTY0QjA2M0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPEM2NDQ1MUVCLjVEQUU5JWVtaWx5am9AZW1pbHlqby5jb20+IDwxNzRkZjlkYzA5MDUzMDEwNTZnMzY4ZmE4NTBoN2E0NGNmZmM3NTM4ODEyMUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDdEMTkxMTU5LUZBMTktNDVGOS04RUM5LTY1NTI3NUMxNkI2QUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPERGNEQ5MjdFLTZERDgtNDQzOS1CNTM3LTg4RjM5MkU5MUZGM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45621,"nextInTopic":45623,"prevInTime":45621,"nextInTime":45623,"topicId":45528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What  <br/>\ndoes your own past experience say? What do people you trust say?

This is a bit of<br/>\na safety issue, as I don&#39;t want&#39; anyone finding us weird and reporting us to<br/>\nauthorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to take the theft of a dslite or gameboy as an affront.  But my kids<br/>\ntaught me to let go of this idea.  Two of my kids had expensive toys go<br/>\nawol.  I confronted other parents, but learned that if some people are so<br/>\nattached to things that they will steal them from others its pretty scary to<br/>\ninvest emotionally in &quot;stuff&quot;.  I learned from my kids not to do this when<br/>\nthey philosophically dealt with &quot;missing&quot; toys by saving their money and<br/>\nre-purchasing them and then being choosier about whom they shared with.  I<br/>\nstill have ideas about justice and friendship to work through&lt;grin&gt;.  I did<br/>\nwant to do something about the the thefts but my kids were willing to let go<br/>\nand they talked about what they had learned and they didn&#39;t want to get<br/>\nanyone in &quot;trouble&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if toys are used to help relate that is great, but if toys are<br/>\nused as a distraction from relating then that doesn&#39;t work.  My kids are<br/>\nable and have watched marathon tv.  They don&#39;t do this now because it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t interest them.  If they watched for six hours I would be sitting<br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was merely sharing things that work for me...spending time with the kids<br/>\nminimizes mess.  Mess, housework and organization were the original posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts also helpful to create that infrastructure for toys:  shelves and boxes<br/>\ndesigned by the kids keep things safe.  Toys do require cleaning, repairing<br/>\nand recharging.  Children choke on loose pieces of toys.I once suffered pain<br/>\nfor weeks after a sprained groin.    Marbles on the kitchen floor unattended<br/>\nwhile walking with a nursling in a sling don&#39;t mix :)  I wasn&#39;t thinking of<br/>\nasthetics or my attachment to &quot;cleaning&quot;--just the safety of everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLife is always happening<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78881874,"authorName":"emiLy Q.","from":"&quot;emiLy Q.&quot; &lt;emilyjo@...&gt;","profile":"hanlone","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Cleaning Evolution...part 1 of ?","postDate":"1243539387","msgId":45598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2NDQ1MUVCLjVEQUU5JWVtaWx5am9AZW1pbHlqby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4MzdERjBELTNCQzAtNDg3OS1CMjk1LUIzMDQ3OTY0QjA2M0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":45592,"nextInTopic":45616,"prevInTime":45597,"nextInTime":45599,"topicId":45528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Apart from computers,  <br/>\n&gt; wii and<br/>\n&gt; television my kids can play with rags, sticks, sand and have such a  <br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, rags, sticks, and sand are better than toys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Toys seem to be parent substitutes, but require a lot of management,<br/>\n&gt; money and storage.  They also separate you from you kids as you  <br/>\n&gt; constantly<br/>\n&gt; clean, and juggle such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if you let them separate you from your children! If all you can  <br/>\nthink of is &quot;there are too many toys and I have to clean them up,&quot;  <br/>\nyou&#39;re already in a place where enjoying toys *with* your kids won&#39;t  <br/>\never be an option. That leads to &quot;toys get in the way of relationships  <br/>\n- let&#39;s get rid of them&quot; when it&#39;s the parent who is getting in the  <br/>\nway, instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our house is the messiest place, but when the kids and I are  <br/>\n&gt; spending our<br/>\n&gt; time together rather than me cleaning it suddenly become neater and<br/>\n&gt; inexpicably cleaner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because they don&#39;t play freely? Because you manage the situation?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have realized that there were two radically opposed ideas at play  <br/>\n&gt; here.<br/>\n&gt; One, I needed to clean the house to be a good mother.  Thus I needed  <br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; alone, and then enforce this clean policy on the family that the  <br/>\n&gt; house being<br/>\n&gt; clean was sacrosanct.  I would then be too tired to be any fun or too<br/>\n&gt; invested in the clean house to risk all that work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idea number two is that I need to spend time with the kids that is<br/>\n&gt; fun/compassionate.  While I was cleaning the kids were using &quot;mother<br/>\n&gt; substitutes&quot;:  toys, tv, junk food...They were patiently waiting for  <br/>\n&gt; me to<br/>\n&gt; finish and be engaged with them.  Duh!  They were leaving wrappers  <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt; couch while I tackled the other room, then leaving mess in the  <br/>\n&gt; kitchen while<br/>\n&gt; I organized the toys.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think changing your attitude entirely about cleaning will help.

In our main bathroom, the<br/>\ngirls and I had been keeping our toothbrushes and toothpaste.  At the<br/>\ntime I rarely used the master bath off the master bedroom because that<br/>\nroom was the office at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, me and my compulsion to tidy things, I&#39;d go to brush my teeth, and<br/>\nthe darn toothpaste was always in the wrong location.   So, I&#39;d put it<br/>\nback where it belonged, to find that, the next time I went to use it, it<br/>\nwas in the wrong location again.  Who is doing this?  That&#39;s what I was<br/>\nthinking, I mean, how dare someone go and put the toothpaste in the<br/>\nwrong location and for what reason would someone do this?  Gosh, it was<br/>\ntotally bugging me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one day, Chamille comes to me and says something like, &quot;mom, why do<br/>\nyou keep putting the toothpaste in the wrong location?&quot;  and I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking to myself, ah ha, the toothpaste moving culprit, but it made me<br/>\nsuddenly realize that, Chamille lives here too, not that I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nthis already, but the awareness suddenly hit me, that she will have a<br/>\nvery different idea of how the house should be than I do, and she, being<br/>\nan equal member in our shared living space really does have an idea of<br/>\nhow things should be in our shared living space!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s when a lot of things changed in regards to how I chose to keep<br/>\nour living spaces.  I use the master bathroom now, since I am using that<br/>\nas my bedroom too, but that bathroom is now the main bathroom, the ones<br/>\nthat guests use.  The main bathroom, the one that traditionally would be<br/>\nused for guests, is Chamille&#39;s.  I call it Chamille&#39;s office, since<br/>\nthat&#39;s where she does her business of make-up and hair.  It&#39;s very very<br/>\nmessy, and I will put a picture of it on my blog today if I have time,<br/>\nbecause I told someone that I would do so soon anyway.  She spreads her<br/>\nstuff out on the counters and the floor.  There is hair dye on the<br/>\nceiling.  About once a week, I&#39;ll go in and tidy up a little and wipe<br/>\ndown counters and clean the toilet and shower for her, which she<br/>\nappreciates enormously because she really can&#39;t be bothered with that<br/>\ntedium in her creative space.  It stays all clean for about half a day<br/>\ntops, then it goes back to looking like it did before, except for the<br/>\nclean toilet and shower, that stays clean for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of kids that come over to our house comment on her bathroom and<br/>\nhow messy it is, or how their parents would kill them if they did that<br/>\nto any of the bathrooms in their house.

I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll together chart our growth, and maybe show how it all unfolds for those who feel overwhelmed by what their heart needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of what&#39;s here is embarrassing, some makes me ashamed.  But it&#39;s who I was, on Tuesday, November 18, 2008 at 8:43pm (according to the Facebook note tag).  There will be accounts from a bit further in our evolution, hopefully sooner than later. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested, I have my comments which were included in the ensuing discussion.  And feel free to comment on any of it - aybe it&#39;ll help someone else out there pass this place with more joy....<br/>\n<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Parenting Challenge....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest parenting challenge during the last several months has been cleaning. Or, rather, getting the little tornadoes that share my living space (and sometimes the big spousal tornado, too, but that&#39;s another issue) to simply clean up and put away what they&#39;ve used.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am lucky. My children are bright, happy, and healthy. Giggles and squeals of laughter are commonly bounding about in our little home. They get along well with each other, invent wonderful games of fantasy....and leave stuff EVERYWHERE. Both love every artistic medium they&#39;ve encountered, books, music, building toys and puzzles. Both love to role play. My daughter will spend an entire afternoon hosting tea parties and birthdays for an eclectic collection of invisible, baby doll, and stuffed primate friends (two of these, a red monkey and a three foot gorilla, are nearly bigger than she is!). And, of course, she must do this dressed up (in whatever required the most pulling-and-tossing to get to!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a self-professed artist/sculptor/scientist/inventor. Lately, he&#39;s gotten into spying, and often eavesdrops on adult conversations (Again, that&#39;s another issue). And he reads. Constantly. And I, the bibliophile mother who swore the only thing she&#39;d ever disown her children for was NOT loving books, grit my teeth as I try to avoid the current pile he&#39;s devouring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy greatest triumph? That I realized after seven years, that this is not their problem, but mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are raising our children in a manner often called unschooling. Rather than make demands, to insist that they obey because we the parents say they must, we&#39;ve decided to treat them as equals...not equal in experience, knowledge, or decision-making to be sure, but equal as unique beings in this world, with the same need for respect, love, and dignity as any adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I try to find ways to help them see that actions beget consequences. Every choice will have a result. My job as a parent is to make choosing to act wisely much more pleasant than choosing another path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t easy. I often have to adjust my expectations - I tend to expect them to know what I need, to be thinking on the same level as I am. And that they not mess up MY house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is of course the only home they&#39;ve ever known. It is their sanctuary, their playground, their workplace, their schoolroom, their studio, their stage, their laboratory. It is the axis upon which their world spins. Given that...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s the part I&#39;m still working on.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45690,"nextTopicId":45633}}
