My DD(6) was diagnosed with celiac disease and changing <br/>\nher diet to exclude all gluten and gluten cross contamination DID result in a seemingly <br/>\nmagical change. I am not saying I think this child has celiac disease, but I am saying <br/>\ngathering information and ruling things out to help a child feel better makes sense. The <br/>\nmore you can do this without seemingly randomly  (from the kid&#39;s point of view) <br/>\ncontrolling your child&#39;s choices the better. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are high energy and happily so.  My daughter was high then low and wanted <br/>\neverything and nothing and when she had gluten in her system she was miserable with not <br/>\nbeing able to make sense of any of it. With the gluten gone she has still has highs and <br/>\nlows in energy and mood, but the energy behind them is different.  She can talk about <br/>\noptions and preferences and brainstorm solutions or take a step away and be with anger <br/>\nor disappointment or choices or confusion or chaos or joy without  erratic energy making <br/>\nher feel totally out of control and without resulting in physical outbursts that frequently <br/>\nleft her or others injured which only upset her even more, especially if she hurt others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sensitive to people seemingly randomly blaming food sensitivities and/or allergies on <br/>\nnormal healthy kid dispositions.  I am also sensitive to people dismissing the possibility <br/>\nwhen others are exploring it. I am pretty sensitive to some things myself, but food <br/>\ncontrols and judgements in my childhood meant that it took me many years into <br/>\nadulthood to figure out things for my own body - I&#39;m still working on it. My own kids - <br/>\nwho eat what they choose- are pretty wise and very aware of their own bodies.  My 8 year <br/>\nold eats very little dairy because she&#39;s found she does better without it and she&#39;s decided <br/>\nthat a lot of sugar without some protein makes her feel tired. She takes this info into <br/>\naccount when she makes her choices.  She sometimes chooses to eat these things anyway, <br/>\nand she doesn&#39;t beat herself up when she does. I see my role as helping them navigate all <br/>\nof this without clouding things with my own unresolved issues or prejudices.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD with celiac is VERY careful to make sure she does not get any gluten! She is not <br/>\nwilling to suffer the consequences.  I do everything I can to make her life amazingly <br/>\nyummy and abundant in a world that could easily look full of lack for her.  For her, not <br/>\nfollowing a lifelong gluten free diet could have dire health consequences. She is 6 and we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t really talked much about that.  Eventually she will have that info, but at this time it <br/>\nis enough for her to eat this way to feel good now. And I&#39;m will be forever grateful that <br/>\nsomeone suggested getting her tested even when she didn&#39;t have all of the &quot;classic&quot; <br/>\nsymptoms. With that stress on her body gone she can get on with  living a joyful life.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357843301,"authorName":"lyeping2008","from":"&quot;lyeping2008&quot; &lt;lyeping2008@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2008","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyper... now we know!","postDate":"1230594747","msgId":41236,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdqYm5ycit2Y2E1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQyNTQ1MTIzLUI5MjItNEQ2MS1BOEQ0LUUyNEZEM0MzQzAwMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41235,"nextInTopic":41237,"prevInTime":41235,"nextInTime":41237,"topicId":41117,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Over the last 3  years of <br/>\nseemingly-unexpected quick movements, split lips and bitten  tongues, Dave and I <br/>\nhave learned to either &quot;chin up&quot; or turn our heads  aside. Sometimes I *do* <br/>\nforget and then I just kick myself for forgetting!  :~)<br/>\n <br/>\nBoth my boys are high energy and constantly on the move. I was  like that <br/>\nwhen I was younger, too. My need for movement was trained down into  vibrating my <br/>\nleg or bouncing my knee because I moved &quot;too much&quot;, according to my  mother. <br/>\nEven that eventually went by the wayside because she &quot;couldn&#39;t stand&quot; my  leg <br/>\nbouncing. Now that I&#39;ve read how many calories that burns, I wish I could  <br/>\nre-integrate it into myself! People often see my boys in public with their high  <br/>\nenergy and say something like, &quot;At least they&#39;ll sleep well, tonight&quot;. Well, <br/>\nno.  They&#39;re always high energy. It doesn&#39;t wear them out-in fact, sometimes, I <br/>\nthink  energy begets more energy! But, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re in a family where <br/>\nhigh energy  is cool and not something to be controlled or &quot;used&quot; as a sleep <br/>\ninducer, and I  just smile at the other person. Sometimes I correct them, <br/>\nsometimes I  don&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my boys&#39; energy seems to get to a frenetic level where  they seem to <br/>\nfeel *it* is controlling *them*, we try to do huge energy users  with them: <br/>\nbouncing on the trampoline (uses *much* more energy than jumping on  the couch), <br/>\nrestraint games, full-out running-and-yellling-and-waving-of-arms  activity. One <br/>\nof the boys&#39; favorites is one we call &quot;Escape&quot;. An adult wraps a  child (or <br/>\nsometimes, big brother with little brother) in their arms and legs,  holding <br/>\nsnugly to avoid wiggle-out, and we gloat in an &quot;evil&quot; voice, &quot;I&#39;ve got  you, <br/>\nnow! You&#39;ll never escape!&quot; repeating as they struggle to force our arms  away <br/>\nfrom them (as they giggle wildly) so they can get away. It used to be  easier <br/>\nwhen we first started, but they are getting *strong*!! So, now we have to  play <br/>\nseveral rounds, because they don&#39;t use the huge amounts of energy in one  round <br/>\nthat they used to. Tickling is a great energy-user as well... all that  <br/>\nstruggle and laughter... Dave and I just have to remember to listen well for  <br/>\n&quot;stop&quot;, so that we can stop immediately. Which is often followed right up by  &quot;go&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;tickle&quot; or &quot;more&quot;, because they enjoy it so much. But we only employ  <br/>\nthese techniques when they seem controlled by or overwhelmed by the extreme end  <br/>\nof their energy. Most of the time there is lots of running, bouncing, yelling,  <br/>\nwrestling, jumping-out-and-boo-ing, screaming with the thrill, sliding,  <br/>\ntumbling, and other energy outputs here. It is just who they are and their  <br/>\nactivities are joyful to all of us (most of the time). Funny, they&#39;re happy to  sit <br/>\nand paint quietly sometimes with Grandma... but maybe that&#39;s because they  <br/>\nknow they can be loud and active any time at home.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe unschooling groups really helped us adjust our thinking on  high energy, <br/>\n*and* we got some ideas, but mostly it was seeing what worked in  our family <br/>\nas we went along. &quot;Escape&quot; may not work for some kids just like other  kids&#39; <br/>\nsolutions don&#39;t work for our kids. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have also made adaptations for our kids indoor energy  <br/>\nexpenditure-especially for wintertime. They also seem to see uses for things we  never would have <br/>\non our own! We put a loft bed above a double bed to get rid of  the crib, but <br/>\nno one sleeps on it - however, it seems to have been obvious to  the boys <br/>\nfrom the beginning that it was some sort of gymnastics equipment! :~) I  ask them <br/>\nto keep it tamed down when I&#39;m still in bed, since it has escalated to  being <br/>\nhit by flying feet, arms, heads, etc. before, but once I&#39;m awake and out  of <br/>\nthe way, they&#39;ve found amazing ways to use it for flips and hanging upside  <br/>\ndown, and hanging rightside up! We&#39;re in the process of putting in a rope  <br/>\nswing/climber, as well. Having lots of space cleared for big body movements and  <br/>\nactivity is something I keep in the forefront of my brain to do. Big movement  <br/>\ngames like Twister and Hullabaloo are important, as well. And if all else <br/>\nfails,  finding someplace outside our home and yard for huge activity works,  too.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************One site keeps you connected to all your email: AOL Mail, <br/>\nGmail, and Yahoo Mail.

DS likes Frosties too, and he seems <br/>\nfine eating it. So we&#39;re alternating his breakfast between cereals and <br/>\neggs and toast and pancakes, like we did before. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it&#39;s been a week now, we stuck to soft bowl eggs with cornflakes <br/>\n(i know this sounds yukky, but it works coz the cornflakes is actually <br/>\nsalty). He&#39;s all of the sudden calmed yesterday and this morning, woke <br/>\nup nice and easy (unlike the past 3 weeks whereby he literally sprung <br/>\nout of bed the minute his eyes opened LOL!), able to focus on what <br/>\nhe&#39;s doing and able to &quot;hear&quot; what we&#39;re saying and glad to say, less <br/>\naccident prone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, like yogurt especially the organic type. Strange when he had <br/>\nthose sugar loaded normal kiddie ones, he seems fine. But when we <br/>\nswithced into an organic brand, if I remember correctly, too much of <br/>\nit seems to coincidde with his erratic mood. So nowadays, he&#39;s only <br/>\nhave a small cup amount daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much crisp and cornchips also trigger off his hyperness. But then <br/>\nlike i said, if it&#39;s there, it&#39;s meant to be eaten. So if we buy any, <br/>\nI&#39;m prepared to let him go thru the whole bag until it&#39;s finished.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd chewing gum too.
