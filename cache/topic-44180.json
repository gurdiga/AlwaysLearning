The security agents were more than willing to issue a gate pass for me AND all three of her younger brothers, but the only thing I really needed was to make sure she made it through the security screening.  We had decided last minute to not check her suitcase when they tried to charge an extra fee - so I had her perfume and suntan lotion in my purse and would not have been able to get through without all of us returning to the parking garage first.  Since we had not even known it was an option to go to the gate, she had planned to go through alone anyway.  She was able to use her cell phone at the gate and even on the plane while they waited on the ground for an extra hour or so delay for a storm to clear up somewhere in the area they were to fly through.  This would give you a way to be in contact with him right up until departure.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast spring when we flew to London, we were on Virgin Atlantic airlines and each seat had its own viewing screen and hand held controller with access to movies, music, and games.  There was also a channel to track exactly where we were at any point during the flight.  They showed how many miles traveled, how far left, and an estimated arrival time - kind of cool to check out occasionally. Perhaps, you could check the airline your son is flying to see if there will be similar distractions for Toby to look forward to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould he be interested in bringing a camera to document the trip for you?  Does he have a particular friend among the kids he has already met?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like an exciting trip!!! Hope he enjoys the experience!!!<br/>\nDonna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: My oldest has a question...","postDate":"1240454365","msgId":44219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4QzZDQjhELTdGRkMtNEFBNC1CNUMxLTU0MDU0Q0ZFMjYyRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzb2gxOCs2ZnIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzb2gxOCs2ZnIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44218,"nextInTopic":44221,"prevInTime":44218,"nextInTime":44220,"topicId":44180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= I ve read through some of the airline policies and it looks like they allow an adult through at both ends of travel if a child is listed as Unaccompanied","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-82519598\">-= I&#39;ve read through some of the airline policies and it looks like  <br/>\nthey allow an adult through at both ends of travel if a child is  <br/>\nlisted as &quot;Unaccompanied Minor&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.

Since some of the people on this list live in Europe, I was hoping to get an answer here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo kids in England and France play Pokemon, YuGiOh, Chaotic, Magic the Gathering, and other similar card games?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, he&#39;s never been on a plane before, and he&#39;s pretty nervous about the flight over to Europe.  He is old enough to remember 9/11, and I think that is part of what is bothering him.  He&#39;s also afraid of heights.  If you have any suggestions to help with his anxiety, we would love to hear them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44238,"nextTopicId":44225}}
