Math is a huge one for me too. I spent <br/>\n2 years doing algebra in high school and finally passed with a &quot;B&quot;. <br/>\nDo I remember most of it?? NO WAY!!! So, I had my dh show her how to <br/>\ndo some of it. I think some of the fear, too, is that she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to pursue a lot of &quot;intellectual&quot; kinds of things.....please <br/>\ndon&#39;t misunderstand me.....my daughter is very smart, but she just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t pursue things such as history, science, etc (totally <br/>\nuninterested in most of it). She&#39;s content just cooking different <br/>\nthings for our family (which is wonderful), reading magazines & teen <br/>\nchristian fiction,shoppping for clothes, and practicing her irish <br/>\ndancing. That being said though....she begins comparing herself to <br/>\nher friends who are homeschooled very traditionally, who are studying <br/>\nfor PSAT&#39;s, doing high level math, etc, etc and she starts stressing <br/>\nout because she&#39;s constantly comparing herself to everyone else (and <br/>\nsaying she feels stupid). She has a huge self-confidence problem as <br/>\nwell. I try hard to tell her that she&#39;s very smart and that there are <br/>\ndifferent kinds of smart. Everyone has their own unique and God-given <br/>\nabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe decided to go ahead and finish her book 4 of her algebra (they <br/>\nare only about 30-40 pgs long)because she doesn&#39;t like to leave <br/>\nthings unfinished. I&#39;ll ask her if she wants to take a break after <br/>\nthat and perhaps reevalute in the fall (maybe do some consumer math <br/>\nor something like that,if she&#39;s interested). Maybe I&#39;ll sit down with <br/>\nher and talk to her about what she can see herself doing later on in <br/>\nher life. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the 1st time I will have &quot;graduated&quot; any child of mine and so <br/>\nI guess I&#39;m a bit nervous, especially if my relatives ask what <br/>\ncollege she&#39;ll be going to and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thank you for your advice....feel free to jump in and add any <br/>\nmore....I could use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nDanielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, janesutcliffe@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HI all -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was written: &quot;I guess I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right and I should <br/>\njust let her quit the algebra. &quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To me, it&#39;s not a matter of &#39;letting her quit Algebra&#39;... it&#39;s a <br/>\nmatter of stopping the pressure, harrassment, etc. However your &#39;not <br/>\nletting her quit&#39; is showing up....
