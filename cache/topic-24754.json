Today&#39;s post was just so interesting to me <br/>\nthat I thought  would post it here.  There were no great philosophical <br/>\nrealizations, just a brief peek into the amazing joy that our family <br/>\nhas every day.  Spring is almost here and I am feeling grateful for <br/>\neverything--it is really all so simple.  I just thought I would share!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\nwww.circletheworld.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\nSaturday, March 18, 2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Archimedes and Nancy Drew<br/>\n<br/>\nEvie&#39;s grandma is in town (Scott&#39;s mom) but she is not feeling well so <br/>\nwe are in between full-on grandma time and regular life. Evie had a <br/>\ndouble grandma day yesterday, much to her delight. They went to the <br/>\nUniversity of WI Geology Museum then to a gymnastics open house and out <br/>\nto lunch. My mom and Evie brought the other grandma home and then went <br/>\nout to the farm for frolicking. We went to a great St. Patrick&#39;s Day <br/>\nparty last night and then I got to attend the birth of a dear friend. <br/>\nBoy, being a doula was a great job. I can&#39;t see getting back into it <br/>\nany time soon though, the hours are killer!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning Evie and I finished the latest Nancy Drew we were reading. <br/>\nNancy extricated herself from a closet using a pole as a lever.<br/>\nEvie said, &quot;Hey, Archimedes! Wasn&#39;t he the bathtub and screw guy too?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Huh?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n&quot;You know, displacement and all that.&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;Where did you hear about that?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n&quot;I think it was in a comic book, let&#39;s measure displacment using a <br/>\nmeasuring cup, and egg and milk.&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>\nYikes! What interesting connections!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvie turns six on Monday, I can&#39;t believe it. She is having a Paradise <br/>\nIsland (Wonder Woman&#39;s home) themed b-day party. The main event is to <br/>\nbe creating a castle our of old boxes. That is what she asked for, that <br/>\nis what she is getting. She also asked for a double chocolate cake <br/>\ndecorated with green frosting and Wonder Woman pictures from her books. <br/>\nShe is getting that too. She is also getting way cool presents from <br/>\nScott and I. I won&#39;t write about those until &quot;the&quot; day!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going out for Indonesian food tonight with grandma. After <br/>\ntrapeze this morning Evie came home to play with friends and they have <br/>\nbeen reenacting the Nutcracker ballet all afternoon. I have been <br/>\nputzing and enjoying the sunshine.<br/>\n<br/>\nA day very well lived!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24752,"nextTopicId":24757}}
