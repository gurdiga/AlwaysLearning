The Internet is so huge I am not even sure how I would google for sites she might like and I also don&#39;t have a lot of time looking through these sites. \nSo I was wondering if it was possible to make a list of sites that members of this group found fun and interesting so I could offer these to my children as a starting point. \nBelow is the list Alex wrote and my daughter tried the first two already and loved them. \n\nhttp://www.poissonrouge.com/\nhttp://www.starfall.com/\nhttp://www.linerider.com/\nhttp://fantasticcontraption.com/\nhttp://www.crayonphysics.com/\nhttp://www.roblox.com/Landing/Animated\n\nAdrienn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72814,"nextTopicId":72678}}
