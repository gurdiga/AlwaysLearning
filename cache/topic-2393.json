Too fake? Too superficial? Too contrived. That&#39;s it, I <br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone said, &quot;Oh, yeah, we went to that museum. It was very educational,&quot; <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t know if that was a good thing or not. I&#39;d just like to hear, &quot;Oh, <br/>\nyeah, we had a great time at the museum and there was cool stuff there and I <br/>\nlearned a whole lot about it.&quot; For so many of us, &quot;educational&quot; carries the <br/>\nimplication that someone shoved something down some poor kids&#39; throats &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course there is the argument that you&#39;re probably making, Ren, that to <br/>\nsay one thing IS educational implies that other things are not. From an <br/>\nunschooling point of view that is sort of a nonsense position.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2387,"nextTopicId":2394}}
