When I showed her around she saw one of my big bookshelfs full of <br/>\nbooks and materials and said something like &quot;oh, you still have all the books <br/>\nand stuff?&quot;<br/>\nAs though unschoolers didn&#39;t use real life materials!!! The ignorance is <br/>\namazing.<br/>\nI made some comment about what did she think unschooling was if we weren&#39;t <br/>\nmaking loads of stuff available to our children and she replied that she <br/>\nthought I would have gotten rid of anything curriculum oriented.<br/>\nWhat, like dictionaries?<br/>\nOr the science books my kids love?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve bought some seriously wonderful books cheap from eclectic homeschoolers <br/>\nand unit study type homeschoolers. Eyewitness books. The History of US <br/>\nseries. A newer atlas. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were done with the unit, or with the year&#39;s designated subjects, and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need the books around anymore. They weren&#39;t using textbooks but they <br/>\nthought of what they were using the same way - work through it from start to <br/>\nfinish and when you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family though uses those kinds of books for reference, for leafing <br/>\nthrough, for pondering.  Even when we start at the beginning and read <br/>\nstraight through to the end, we&#39;re not done with them. We&#39;ll be back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll bet your visitor thinks about books the same way those sellers did.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6155,"nextTopicId":6168}}
