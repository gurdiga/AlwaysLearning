That way a person <br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\nbombarding the other person with words, especially important if the <br/>\nother<br/>\nperson is a child. Notice how so much of this is about identifying <br/>\nnegative<br/>\nfeelings. So often &quot;because&quot; is followed by &quot;you did something.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly how I felt about NVC when my friend started talking <br/>\nabout it a few years ago.  Internal self-talk could really improve by <br/>\nmaking distinctions between thoughts and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It sure would be great if everyone expressed themselves well and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thoughtfully, and always said &quot;I think&quot; when expressing opinion and &quot;I <br/>\nfeel&quot;<br/>\nwhen really naming an emotion.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s why I stopped saying &quot;I feel&quot; a couple years ago and kept &quot;I <br/>\nthink.&quot;  I rarely talk about my feelings because they are basically <br/>\ndirect expressions of my needs and I could express them more directly <br/>\nwithout the word &quot;feel&quot; in there.  I&quot;m scared is not a way to identify <br/>\nyourself as a fearful person but to express your need for security in <br/>\nthe moment.  I&#39;m not worried if people think I&quot;m fearful when I don&#39;t <br/>\nuse the words &quot;I feel scared.&quot;  There&#39;s not an appreciable difference <br/>\nto me in the phrasing.  So I drop &quot;feel&quot; from the phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still use the phrasing &quot;I feel that&quot; followed by my opinion because <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure no one gets the idea that my feelings are as involved <br/>\nas my thoughts.  And a key point here is that even in opinions, <br/>\nfrequently there&#39;s a lot more about feelings and needs than about <br/>\nthoughts anyway.  My thoughts are greatly influenced by my feelings <br/>\nthough not as overcome with feelings as they used to be (most of the <br/>\ntime).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re really very intertwined but recognizing how often feelings and <br/>\nemotions are present in our thoughts and actions is a big part of the <br/>\ncommunication puzzle for me, both internally and with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: going beyond judgment/punishment (was &quot;are you a good mom or a bad mom?&quot;)","postDate":"1242146345","msgId":44928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1QjYzODIzLTU2QkYtNDNGQi1CQjZBLUU4QjM5RkFDRDY4QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1YzZsbys3bXY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd1YzZsbys3bXY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44920,"nextInTopic":44929,"prevInTime":44927,"nextInTime":44929,"topicId":44861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I like this a lot.

He should be  <br/>\nconsiderate.  He should put the top on before it rains.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe assumption when people come to this list is that they want to  <br/>\nbecome better unschoolers.

This morning at something like 8am I was about <br/>\nto go to bed (yes AM) and the last thing I did was check my email, and saw <br/>\nthat first post. In my case I really didn&#39;t have the time or energy to read <br/>\nthoroughly, but unlike bigandlittle6, I also didn&#39;t have time to compose a <br/>\nlengthy response. But I did go to bed chuckling to myself because I figured <br/>\nI would get up to find exactly what I found from the list. I&#39;m really sorry <br/>\nthat my sleep needs prevented me from participating in today&#39;s chat, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s a clue: If you don&#39;t have time to read, you don&#39;t have time to <br/>\npost....repeatedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think NVC translates well at all to any kind of written format. The <br/>\nbest impression I have had of NVC is actually hearing some long time <br/>\nunschoolers using it in a personally meaningful way with their own <br/>\nchildren - by which I mean they made the words their own and focussed on the <br/>\nlistening part. The most useful tool I ever got from it was the phrase &quot;Are <br/>\nyou willing to....?&quot; asked as a genuine question with &quot;no&quot; being a real <br/>\npossibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a person coming online and writing roughly &quot;NVC says we <br/>\nSHOULDN&#39;T say SHOULD, and so everyone here (this means you) SHOULD use NVC&quot; <br/>\nis helping to promote NVC. Perhaps bigandlittle6 doesn&#39;t realize that the <br/>\nmessage is coming across with such hypocrisy.  Maybe direct the vitriol at <br/>\nthe author of the book Sandra found instead, if you must.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe try being the change you want to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I tried it some years ago in my bumbling way with James, with motives <br/>\nnot disimilar to Brad&#39;s in his story, I got rightly shut down very quickly <br/>\nby my far more clear eyed husband. I saw the fault as being somewhere in my <br/>\nintentions, rather than the formula. I don&#39;t know, maybe the fact that it is <br/>\na formula?...I like the idea &quot;Seek first to understand, then be understood.&quot; <br/>\nMaybe in finding understanding, ie listening (reading), the need to express <br/>\nmight fade away. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve often found anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read about NVC, I thought that a lot of it *should* ;) stay internal. <br/>\nIdentifying one&#39;s feelings, doing the mental process of saying &quot;I feel <br/>\nfrustrated because...&quot; , &quot;I feel annoyed because...&quot;, &quot;I feel scared <br/>\nbecause....&quot; and owning one&#39;s own part in the feelings, discovering one&#39;s <br/>\nown needs, might work better by staying internal. That way a person isn&#39;t <br/>\nbombarding the other person with words, especially important if the other <br/>\nperson is a child. Notice how so much of this is about identifying negative <br/>\nfeelings. So often &quot;because&quot; is followed by &quot;you did something.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess no-one needs NVC to say &quot;I feel happy because....&quot; And yet, coming <br/>\nfull circle, one&#39;s happiness could be used as tool to motivate kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a writer expresses themselves here in such a manner as to immediately <br/>\naffront, offend and irritate their readers, any good within their message is <br/>\nlikely to be overlooked. Much of bigandlittle6&#39;s message for me was tainted <br/>\nby her(?) condescending (my judgement) attitude. Which is unfortunate, <br/>\nbecause in rereading her first post I found that we share a pet peeve.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I hear people every single day, confusing thoughts as feelings.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout getting into the jargon about self-judgment, I agree. My observation <br/>\nis when someone says &quot;I feel *that*....&quot; usually they have stepped out of <br/>\ntalking about their feelings and into thoughts.  My challenge when I hear <br/>\nthis is to avoid the path to annoyance and wishing that person were a better <br/>\ncommunicator or more self-aware, and instead to work to identify the feeling <br/>\nthey are unable to express clearly. Maybe that way my compassion would be <br/>\nengaged instead of my judgement.  Sometimes I have to work hard to engage my <br/>\ncompassion. When I feel frustrated or outraged by a story someone has told <br/>\nespecially when they are seeking help, often my best course is to stay <br/>\nsilent until I learn more and examine my own feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sure would be great if everyone expressed themselves well and <br/>\nthoughtfully, and always said &quot;I think&quot; when expressing opinion and &quot;I feel&quot; <br/>\nwhen really naming an emotion. It sure would be great if I were able to live <br/>\nup to my own ideals. Not being able to identify one&#39;s own feelings can make <br/>\nit harder to identify one&#39;s needs. There is the whole school of thought that <br/>\nthe shortcomings we notice, and react to emotionally, in others are likely <br/>\nto be our own worst faults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;m going to continue trying to grow myself, to be a better mom, by <br/>\nidentifying my shortcomings and my denials about them, my emotional issues, <br/>\nand not direct the precious little spare energy I have into changing others. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a bible passage about not worrying about the mote in someone else&#39;s <br/>\neye, but attending to the log in one&#39;s own....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

NVC felt so Right that<br/>\nanyone who wasn&#39;t using it was doing themselves (and their kids, and their<br/>\nspouse, and their community...the whole planet!) a disservice.  It&#39;s leading<br/>\nedge, so why not try to get everyone to see how Bad their language is, and<br/>\nbring them up to speed? (oops, judgement).<br/>\n<br/>\nI read several books about NVC and spent several months immersing myself in<br/>\nthe philosophy.  I no longer think about NVC very much today because it was<br/>\none tool I needed for a brief time to kick-start me toward seeing my wife as<br/>\nthe most awesome partner on the planet, not as a human roadblock that seemed<br/>\nto get in the way of my peace constantly.  I was in complete Blame mode, and<br/>\nin utter denial that I was in Blame mode.  So trying to &quot;use NVC&quot; language<br/>\nwith my wife, who I labeled as &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;jackal&quot;, just ended up getting<br/>\nin my own way, because NVC is a toy for the ego.  I&#39;m not saying that NVC is<br/>\nflawed or bad, just that it&#39;s a toy/tool that&#39;s no different than 1000&#39;s of<br/>\nother tools out there--it can be used for many purposes no different than a<br/>\nhammer or screwdriver.  When the ego feels Right and Justified, it&#39;s very<br/>\neasy for the ego to use NVC in ways that have absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\nconnection, and instead to Protect and Defend the ego self.  For a while, I<br/>\nthink I had my wife convinced that if we could just &quot;talk NVC&quot;, we could<br/>\nhave peace and connection.  She indulged me for a while, and thankfully she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t completely walk out while I was tantruming and just wanting her to<br/>\nchange to please me.  What I was asking was for her to &quot;accept and support&quot;<br/>\nme, but only in the ways I judged as being Right, such as using NVC<br/>\nlanguage.  It didn&#39;t matter that I perceived myself on many levels as a<br/>\ndamaged child with awful fundamentalist parents who &quot;broke&quot; me and that I<br/>\nwas in complete denial about how much I was blaming them instead of getting<br/>\nover it already and just living a joyful life.  In my mind, I had &quot;forgiven&quot;<br/>\nmy parents at age 18, so I didn&#39;t have any more &quot;dad issues&quot;, dammit!  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ll read here a while with an open (not through NVC belief lenses)<br/>\nmind, you&#39;ll see that every single person who posts here is an aware<br/>\nindividual using the path of parenthood in their own unique way to live a<br/>\njoyful connected life.  And there is a TON to learn on this list.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nabsorbing for a while, not posting much, and my family is more joyful as a<br/>\nresult--because I am.  It starts and ends with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully, my wife hung in there while I tried so hard to convince her how<br/>\nangry and unkind she was being to me, and how many of &quot;my needs&quot; were going<br/>\nunmet, when I needed support so badly and she wouldn&#39;t spoon-feed it to me<br/>\nthe way I wanted.

No, not even Hitler, if you look at his upbringing you might understand better what I&#39;m saying. A very serious case of unmet basic needs there. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a child respond inside when they do something someone else doesn&#39;t like, and they are called &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;? Do you think this is the way to motivate a child? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the most helpful thing we can do is communicate with the child, and listen to the child to communicate (and use temporary *protective* not punitive use of force if anyone or anything is in immediate danger of being harmed, of course!). After the danger is past, we need to know what needs that child was trying to meet with that behavior. Attention? Love? Caring? Support? Connection? Safety? Understanding? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that doesn&#39;t change when those children grow into adults. As adults, we have all those same needs. Why then, do we find it OK to isolate, abuse, ridicule, and abandon those adults who are behaving in ways we hate? Every single thing we do (and this applies to ALL people, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; as you say) is to meet a need. That is how we are wired, that is our nature. The challenge is trying to stay connected enough to puzzle out what the needs are, when the behavior is very challenging to deal with and we just want it to STOP!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do love many things that this group offers. I truly believe in free learning, unschooling, consensual living, non coercive parenting, etc. etc. and I hear that talked about a lot here. But I feel a huge desire to see these things MERGE with NVC, with a more compassionate consciousness. I often hear people here &quot;shoulding&quot; each other, judging each other, saying there is a right way or a wrong way to go about something. When I hear this, I am confused, because aren&#39;t we parents on here striving to treat our children the opposite of this, through unschooling, free learning, etc.? Yet we come on here and &quot;should&quot; other adults? I am lost and confused and discouraged when I hear that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible to broaden the purpose of this wonderful group to include include connecting and building each other up, with compassion and openness? I have heard more than one person tell me they are afraid to post here. Is this something we would like to change, together?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44879,"nextTopicId":45150}}
