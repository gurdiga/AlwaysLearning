They scream when they get frustrated. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Temperament matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re ALWAYS going to feel like other people don&#39;t understand what you are <br/>\ngoing through - because you have very explosive, dramatic, intense, <br/>\npassionate children. Some people have easygoing, mild-tempered, and even <br/>\ncompliant children &lt;G&gt;. They think that because their son has a little <br/>\nmeltdown once in a while, when he&#39;s tired or hungry, that that is all that you<br/>\n&#39;re dealing with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people will always be judgmental about how you&#39;ve parented your kids - <br/>\nbecause the kids will probably always be temperamentally like this and some <br/>\npeople are really uncomfortable around super strong emotions and they&#39;ll <br/>\nblame YOU for not having &quot;tamed&quot; your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s my first advice -- don&#39;t compare your kids to others and don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you&#39;re screwing up just because the kids are like this. You&#39;ll have <br/>\ncalmer times, times of more equilibrium, and rougher wilder times, but really <br/>\nI think it is a good idea to assume you&#39;re never going to turn your kids into <br/>\ncalm and easy-going mellow people.<br/>\n<br/>\n And there is nothing WRONG with perfectionist tendencies -- it just means <br/>\nwanting to do things right. Do you want a doctor who is satisfied with <br/>\nmediocre, so-so, muddling through? There is a place in the world for <br/>\nperfectionists. So VALUE that in your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said -- you obviously want to help them be more happy - and pitching a <br/>\nfit because they might get glue on their fingers isn&#39;t happy. This little guy <br/>\nprobably is going to need to learn that there are always going to be projects <br/>\nthat just aren&#39;t &quot;his thing&quot; -- so the best thing you can do is commisserate <br/>\nwhile he&#39;s learning it - take him someplace else so he doesn&#39;t ruin the fun <br/>\nfor other kids -- and find him some stuff to do that he can enjoy. But once <br/>\nyou&#39;ve offered him something that he can enjoy, if he turns it down, let it <br/>\nbe. You also have to be sure you don&#39;t take on the burden of making him be <br/>\nhappy about it -- you do your part and then let him be happy or unhappy as he <br/>\nwishes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there probably is a lot you can probably do to reduce the amount <br/>\nof fighting and melting down, etc. (Just don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to change <br/>\nyour kids&#39; natures.)
