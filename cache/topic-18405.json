He is only about an <br/>\ninch taller than the babies and he is driven by some impulse to put headlocks on <br/>\nthese toddlers.  Sometimes he wails away on their heads.  He wraps his arms <br/>\naround their faces and squeezes with his fingers in their eyes, etc.  It&#39;s <br/>\nhorrible and frightening for the babies.  It&#39;s impossible yet for him to remember <br/>\nto &quot;touch gently&quot; each time, and the babies&#39; mothers have finally asked that he <br/>\nbe taught not touch at all.  So what we do is have an adult stand between him <br/>\nand the babies as much as possible, or engage him or carry the babies when <br/>\nnecessary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think your older child has to be prevented from hurting your younger child, <br/>\nand if that means you sit with them or near them when they&#39;re together, or <br/>\nyou tote the younger one with you when you leave the room, then you just do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Games-Sibling Harmony","postDate":"1074885354","msgId":18405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTIzMTkxNTU0LjQwODQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzQ4NTIwMTcuMzQ0Ljc4Njc5Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18416,"prevInTime":18404,"nextInTime":18406,"topicId":18405,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... of not wanting to play anything ...

That<br/>\ngives Alex (5) a chance to shine and be the winner<br/>\nsometimes against Thomas&#39; (7) greater experience. <br/>\nThomas is hyper competitive too, and throws a fit when<br/>\nhe loses, so it can be tricky.  Train dice is a good<br/>\none, it&#39;s special dice with train engines and cars on<br/>\nthe different sides, and you get varying points for<br/>\nvarying combinations, or any dice games like that. <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a game I want to get called Basket Full of<br/>\nPigs, or something like that, where you throw little<br/>\nrubber pigs instead of dice.

Nothing has really worked so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas, because of his neurological issues, has a hard<br/>\ntime learning from cause and effect, and is not easy<br/>\nto reason with either.  If I hear a conflict<br/>\nescalating, I try to go talk with them about it. <br/>\nOften it is because Thomas took a toy of Alex&#39; or that<br/>\nAlex was playing with, and won&#39;t give it back.  We try<br/>\nto talk to him about empathy (how would you feel...)<br/>\nand all sorts of things.  We try to talk about<br/>\ncompromises, and about violence not being an ok way to<br/>\nexpress his needs here, and so on and so forth. <br/>\nBasically it all ends up feeling like we are policing<br/>\nhim, which I hate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas still will almost never give up the toy in<br/>\nquestion, and most of the time does not even seem to<br/>\nbe hearing us talk to him.  He basically has the<br/>\ntoddler mentality right now (If it&#39;s yours, it&#39;s mine.<br/>\n If you are doing something cool with it, it&#39;s mine. <br/>\nIf I want it, it&#39;s mine.  If I used to have it, it&#39;s<br/>\nmine.  etc)  He will just keep repeating &quot;But, I want<br/>\nit.&quot; or  &quot;I think it&#39;s cool.&quot;  Or somethng similar, as<br/>\nthough that is a justification for his behavior.  Alex<br/>\nis actually bigger than Thomas by a good amount of<br/>\nweight and height, but he is a very gentle and<br/>\nsensative person and does not like to resort to<br/>\nviolence, even to defend himself.  I certainly don&#39;t<br/>\nthink he should have to, on a daily basis, with his<br/>\nown family.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else have a child that is non-neurotypical<br/>\n(as Anne calls it, thanks Anne for that) who is not<br/>\nrespecting, and is even abusing, a sibling like this? <br/>\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am really<br/>\ntired of the battles, and of feeling like the Toy<br/>\nPolice, and of Alex acting helpless and being abused. <br/>\nI don&#39;t want Alex to learn that we have to fight his<br/>\nbattles for him either.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18435,"nextTopicId":18426}}
