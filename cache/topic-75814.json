It was really great. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a whole world of feeling safe, being safe, being secure (my husband&#39;s preferenceâ€”financial security, having insurance, savings, having extra milk in the extra fridge, and extra toilet paper in the garage.   It makes me feel safe that he&#39;s always been that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t know those kinds of things.  And they don&#39;t need to.  But if the parents can contribute to what makes the other adult(s) and grown or teen kids feel secure, that adds to safety.  Peace adds to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Labels for methods for philosophies we don&#39;t need","postDate":"1429313782","msgId":75835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJDOTgzNEEwLUMyRkItNDJGRC1CN0ZBLTFBNDg5OURFNkU1Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDVGQzk3QkUzLTBDNDYtNDdBNi05Q0ZDLUM0OTMxRkI1NDc5M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVGQzk3QkUzLTBDNDYtNDdBNi05Q0ZDLUM0OTMxRkI1NDc5M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75819,"nextInTopic":75836,"prevInTime":75834,"nextInTime":75836,"topicId":75814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s natural! But explaining the ideas clearly -- unambiguously -- is hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard because society is stuck on the idea that kids need things done *to*. Kids (supposedly) need taught to read, to be polite, to stop playing video games, to eat sweets in moderation, to be balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard because unschooling can sound like &quot;Do nothing. Give your kids freedom. Learning everything will happen naturally.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of those is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sandra wondered what RIE was I checked. Magda Gerber developed some ideas on infant care for daycare centers (which were the new thing back in the 70s). The good thing is that she saw that infants were more than lumps to be tended. She recognized that their curiosity and drive to understand their world was important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of her ideas fit with unschooling. Some don&#39;t. Some when read from an unschooling mindset sound good. But when read from a school mindset, they take on a different meaning. Which highlights how hard it is to explain unschooling to people coming with a schooled mindset. (Which is practically everyone. We&#39;re *immersed* in messages to fix our kids childish ignorance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGerber: &quot;An environment for the child that is physically safe, <br/>\ncognitively challenging and emotionally nurturing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling &quot;physically safe&quot; is good. :-) I would add in emotionally safe. Kids shouldn&#39;t fear being hit by an adult or another kid. They shouldn&#39;t fear being shamed for choice that mom disapproves of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of &quot;physically safe&quot; for unschooling is NOT to preserve kids&#39; safety. The purpose is so kids don&#39;t fear exploring. I&#39;ll repeat that:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of feeling safe is so kids don&#39;t fear exploring. For learning flourish kids need to feel safe AND free to explore what fascinates them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids&#39; feeling of being safe is separate from their actual safety. Kids grasp pretty quickly that the world has hazards. They&#39;ll understand a few nos. But a mom can be so focused on keeping the child safe that the child feels caged. If a mom blocks a child&#39;s explorations with a buzz of explanations -- TV is bad, video games are addictive, commercial food is full of poison -- the more caged the child will feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids learning is stunted in cages. No matter how clearly a mom thinks she&#39;s explained the need for the cage, it&#39;s still a cage. If the cage prevents them from exploring interests that other kids are exploring, they will feel the walls more keenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the original &quot;environment for the child that is physically safe&quot; could mean a cage with the child wrapped in bubble wrap. ;-) Better for unschooling is an environment where the child FEELS free to explore and IS safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something isn&#39;t safe, the question is, &quot;Can this be made safe?&quot; If not, then, &quot;What would be an even better substitute or alternative?&quot; Then remove or avoid the item so the child isn&#39;t tempted by it until they can understand it&#39;s not safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that was a lot of words spent on 2 words! Two seemingly clear words that sound good for unschooling, but can still lead away from unschooling. I&#39;ll tackle a couple more words in another post.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Labels for methods for philosophies we don&#39;t need","postDate":"1429199335","msgId":75819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxMjkyNTAzOTkuMTc3ODkzMC4xNDI5MTk5MzM1NTk5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG1nbTN1bysxbzdtYzc5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG1nbTN1bysxbzdtYzc5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75818,"nextInTopic":75835,"prevInTime":75818,"nextInTime":75820,"topicId":75814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Miranda I still talk to myself.

But reading through how they&#39;re worded highlights how hard it is to explain how to support kids in growing when everyone is stuck on the need to teach kids. By trying to get people turned away from teaching they can flip around to &quot;hand off&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original ideas (since 1978):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.magdagerber.org/blog/magda-gerbers-rie-philosophy-basic-principles\">http://www.magdagerber.org/blog/magda-gerbers-rie-philosophy-basic-principles</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then someone&#39;s translation into some clear statements:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.janetlansbury.com/2013/12/rie-parenting-basics-9-ways-to-put-respect-into-action/\">http://www.janetlansbury.com/2013/12/rie-parenting-basics-9-ways-to-put-respect-into-action/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBut the simpler the statement, the easier it is for someone to grab it and turn it into a rule. I can see how &quot;We encourage uninterrupted, self-directed play&quot; can turn into, &quot;No, I can&#39;t play with you. It&#39;s best that you direct your own play.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to pull the ideas out of a larger context without them losing something. The &quot;we&quot; is weird and exclusionary. But maybe &quot;Uninterrupted, self-directed play is valuable&quot;? It might be an interesting exercise for Always Learning. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75834,"nextTopicId":75824}}
