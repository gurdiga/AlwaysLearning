This idea of &quot;self-directed&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;directing their own education&quot; seems very different from what <br/>\nactually happens in our daily lives.  It is a lot of schoolishness <br/>\nadded to the thinking process of really &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life, it is so much simpler than that.  I guess that is what <br/>\nit boils down to for me.  Unschooling is simpler, not harder or more <br/>\ndifficult.  There are challenges in parenting, that sort of comes <br/>\nwith the territory of parenting.  Those challenges have been <br/>\nminimized and made simpler with unschooling.  Anything adversarial <br/>\ncreates tension, and tension to any situation makes it harder.  <br/>\nCreating adversary seems ever present in traditional parenting <br/>\nideas.
