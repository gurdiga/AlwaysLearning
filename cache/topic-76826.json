Do you mean things that would normally be taught in school? Because those are fairly arbitrary, you know. Someone at some time made up a list of things they think children ought to learn during their childhood and called it a curriculum and then everyone got caught up in the idea because an &#39;expert&#39; made up the list and from then on in, all those things were seen as &#39;educational&#39; and everything else wasn&#39;t. Unschooling works on the premise that there is learning in everything, therefore everything is educational. When have you ever done a thing you have learned *nothing* from? It&#39;s pretty hard to learn nothing as you will find if you ever have a go at &#39;Learn Nothing Day&#39;: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/\">http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/</a> <br><br>Unschooling means creating a situation in which your children can grow up with all their foundation needs met so that their lives are at the optimum for learning potential. Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs has always been a helpful model for me when thinking about unschooling our children - are our relationships strong? Are they eating plenty? Are they feeling safe and secure? Are they happy? Am I providing lots of opportunities for them to stumble upon things they may discover they have an interest in? Am I helping them to pursue things they are already interested in? If all those things are in place, if all those lower levels of the hierarchy of needs are being met, then learning is just going to happen, and it&#39;s going to be rich and deep and valuable learning. <br><br>So it&#39;s not about not enforcing rules or judging activities as educational or not. It&#39;s that enforcing rules and judging activities as educational or not will more than likely get in the way of meeting those foundation needs and not meeting those foundation needs will get in the way of rich, deep, valuable learning and rich, deep, valuable learning is the aim of unschooling. <br><br>So when you have an arbitrary rule (for example) and trying to enforce that creates conflict, that creates a bit of damage in your relationship and that makes children feel less secure and trusting, which means they have less learning potential (except learning how to circumvent your rule without your knowing, maybe). <br><br>Understanding *why* unschoolers tend not to have enforced arbitrary rules (and other things you&#39;ve listed) rather than simply knowing *that* they tend not to have enforced arbitrary rules etc. seems to me to be really important if you&#39;re going to really get unschooling and be able to do it well.<br><br>Clare</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":577089634,"authorName":"Clare Kirkpatrick","from":"Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;claremkirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457193344","msgId":76862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT3V3UDZWa2VXRFQ3cVhhZC1NNXRqRzFFcm1Kd3hXdCt2XzJPSk8yalE5aVRwVkI4QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5iYTI5OStzZjhnbDVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8bmJhMjk5K3NmOGdsNUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76861,"nextInTopic":76863,"prevInTime":76861,"nextInTime":76863,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But that doesn&#39;t mean that you try and get him to learn a thing you think he ought to learn. Instead, try to find ways to make his life richer and more interesting. Connect more with him. Chatting and being close with him will give you &#39;leads&#39; as to what things might be cool to strew for him. The better you know him, the more you&#39;ll be able to bring him cool things that might spark his interest. Even if it doesn&#39;t, connection and closeness are important anyway. But &#39;just waiting&#39; isn&#39;t really the spirit of unschooling.<br><br>&quot;Do others have stories of children who were introverted like this, perhaps melancholic, but still content/fulfilled and were they able to feel successful and function well as adults (by their own standards)?&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t have any adult children yet, but my oldest is introverted in nature at times and has been through phases of melancholia (she&#39;s now 12.5). What she&#39;s needed during those periods is for me to just be there with her. Sending her interesting things online - showing her I&#39;m thinking of her. Bringing her snacks and drinks. Waking her with a snuggle in bed. Thinking of ways to connect with her that she would feel comfortable with. I would take her out for a coffee just her and me (she has three younger sisters) or shopping. I&#39;d bring her home things I&#39;d seen and thought she&#39;d like. And when she did show an interest in something, I helped her pursue it without going all out over the top, which would invariably send her backwards. She needed not to be feeling the centre of attention or to have too much scrutiny on her interests. She&#39;s a private person. And she functions well as a very mature 12.5 year old! And she has lots of passions and interests - she needed the pressure taking off. She needed us all not to be worrying about her or trying surreptitiously to get her interested in things. We strewed things because we thought they were cool and one or more of the children might be interested but not with the ulterior motive of making her into something she wasn&#39;t at that time. It wasn&#39;t what she needed. What she needed was acceptance and love and connection and if she stumbled upon something that did spark an interest, then that was cool. I think she feared us leaping on any sign of any interest in something and making a big deal of it, though, so we noticed that and were careful to change our ideas and priorities.<br><br>Clare</span></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":577089634,"authorName":"Clare Kirkpatrick","from":"Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;claremkirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457190507","msgId":76860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT3V3UDZXWHlWZTdIPW9Ydm5XS1l1MDRyaj1jRzRWamM9a2J2QVlxcU44NG9DSnptZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5iOHQxZisxaDdsNmp0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Q0FPdXdQNlczPWJ4dExWPXgwK1VhMFM0azUzMU9pOSs1VXZRRnlKZmRwM3pzLVpyU0FnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8bmI4dDFmKzFoN2w2anRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76858,"nextInTopic":76861,"prevInTime":76859,"nextInTime":76861,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I still think knowing my number would be good in case he gets lost when we are out or travelling Even then, it s not necessary.

First, Pam quoted me:<br/>\n<br/>\n________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd wrote in a discussion some years ago (2011, to be more precise):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When a family doesn&#39;t consider learning the primary goal of unschooling, things can disintegrate pretty quickly. YES, once you get it going kids are learning all the time. But if a family starts with the idea that learning is happening all the time, they might never quite get the learning part of unschooling going. And in that case learning will NOT happen all the time. It&#39;s subtle but crucial.”<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian added: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some kind of learning is happening all the time - but not all learning is good. Learning how to sneak food, learning that parents can&#39;t be trusted and counted on, learning to think of oneself in negative ways, all sad. Learning that life is boring, hard work, sucks, hurts, is unfair, also sad. Not what unschoolers are trying for. <br/>\n<br/>\nHuman brains are voracious and will feed on whatever is available - unschoolers should be offering interesting experiences, ideas, stimulation, music, logic, conversation, images, movement, discovery, beauty, etc. Brain food in abundance. It requires effort. It requires attention to qualitative and quantitative aspects of learning. Depth and breadth—creating a lifestyle in which kids are offered the opportunity to learn a lot about some things and a little about a lot of things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n________________</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457135132","msgId":76857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCNVBSMDdNQjE2MjRBQzAxMzhEQzY4Q0I0ODYyM0Q3QUI3QkUwQERCNVBSMDdNQjE2MjQuZXVycHJkMDcucHJvZC5vdXRsb29rLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1REY3MUVFLTgwQ0EtNDNEQi04RENELUMzMjkxRjUwOUI1N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bmJhMjk5K3NmOGdsNUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxuYmJoZmIrOGgwdmI5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4sPDU1REY3MUVFLTgwQ0EtNDNEQi04RENELUMzMjkxRjUwOUI1N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76856,"nextInTopic":76858,"prevInTime":76856,"nextInTime":76858,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==On the one hand radical unschooling tries not to enforce rules, judge activities as good or bad, educational or not etc.== ==On the other hand you have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1861838505\">==On the one hand radical unschooling tries not to enforce rules, judge activities as good or bad, educational or not etc.==<br/>\n<br/>\n==On the other hand you have Sandra saying things like &quot;It&#39;s NOT okay to just let a child stay home and call it homeschooling.&quot; What does that mean?

You can still make life sparkly even if they mostly choose to stay home and play ARK [&#X1f60a]  I know, because we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237179913,"authorName":"LEAH ROSE","from":"LEAH ROSE &lt;mama25kids@...&gt;","profile":"smartymom5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457133965","msgId":76856,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE4MC1XNzM5MTVGQUExRjQ0OEU2NjYzQkMxRUQ3QkUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1REY3MUVFLTgwQ0EtNDNEQi04RENELUMzMjkxRjUwOUI1N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bmJhMjk5K3NmOGdsNUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxuYmJoZmIrOGgwdmI5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4sPDU1REY3MUVFLTgwQ0EtNDNEQi04RENELUMzMjkxRjUwOUI1N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76855,"nextInTopic":76857,"prevInTime":76855,"nextInTime":76857,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-989307250\"><html>\n<head>\n<style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-989307250 .ygrps-yiv-989307250hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrps-yiv-989307250 .ygrps-yiv-989307250hmmessage\n{\nfont-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;}\n--></style></head>\n<div dir='ltr'><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&lt;&lt;&lt;</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;\">I get mixed messages sometimes.

There have been threads where parents accommodate almost any eating habits, including taking food to the rooms of avid gamers and trying to provide food","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-537849279\">==. There have been threads where parents accommodate almost any eating habits, including taking food to the rooms of avid gamers and trying to provide food they will/want to eat. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this almost every day - but i&#39;m not &#39;accomodating eating habits&#39;, I&#39;m making sure my son has food he likes, drinks, and can continue to do what he&#39;s absorbed in at that moment (at the moment, that is also playing ARK with his friends [&#X1f60a]  )<br/>\n<br/>\n==On the other hand you have Sandra saying things like &quot;It&#39;s NOT okay to just let a child stay home and call it homeschooling.&quot; What does that mean? Does that mean I have to be proactively making sure he is learning something?==<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not okay to just let a child stay home and not be a partner, a facilitator, sure. You are looking for rules, when you need to be looking at your children. Are they happy? Are they learning? Are you facilitating their interests? It sounds like they are, and you are, from what you wrote. But you are still worried? Which suggests more deschooling is needed for you - more reading, watching, waiting, repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n==So for example I get comfortable when I hear no limits to screen time because my son (11) is an avid gamer. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people telling you &#39;no limits to screen time&#39; shouldn&#39;t make you &#39;comfortable&#39;. A happy, engaged kid should (although I still don&#39;t think &#39;comfortable is the right word)<br/>\n<br/>\n==My daughter (10) is another example. She is obsessed with horses and is an avid rider.

IF a family is not providing options, and a child is on the computer because there’s nothing else to do, the family isn’t doing a very good job of unschooling.  If, from a wide and varied array of options and opportunities, the child chooses to be on the computer, THEN it was a choice and can be a great thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dichotomy set up in the e-mail is a false one.   First, it personified radical unschooling as a monolithic set of rules.  it set up two voices in opposition.  But there are millions of voices in the world, and thousands of things a family could be doing, and dozens of options in any one day, UNLESS the parents are dulling down their own minds, or limiting options for some reason.

Lots of kids WILL bathe and brush teeth lots.  Some might have persuasion, some might just want to.

I made sure my kids had food they liked and wanted to eat.  When I took food to them, it wasn’t because they were avid gamers.  It was beause there was a new game and a marathon going on, and I knew that boy was going to forget to eat, or not want to leave the game to eat, and could get grumpy from hunger.  Or it was because there was company and the activity was a competitive game that the kids couldn’t play in that way without extra kids over.  I would take food they could all reach and share—something not messy.  Something with protein.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople DO feed their guests. :-)  But those guests didn’t come over to eat.  They came over to play games.  So rather than say [insert sing-songy nasal cartoon mom-voice here] “Boys!  You need to turn the game off now and come and have lunch,” I put food within reach.  Not because they were avid gamers.  Not because that was their “eating habit.”  Because I wanted to support the activity they were doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s like taking cold drinks to people who are working outside in the summer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-There are no limits on things like screen time and no judgement that watching YouTube all day, or gaming all day, as not educational.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is written as though there are rules about lack of limits, and that radical unschooling requires all to state that YouTube all day is educational.   It’s a legalistic sort of description of what can be a rich learning environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t look at what.

Does that mean I have to be proactively making sure he is learning something?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don’t think it’s “on the other hand.”  If a family is standing back, appalled at what seems (from the mom’s description) to be a big life of interaction (online, but online for a child who’s not big into going out), of group projects and research (knowing what’s new in any field is active learning that many professionals don’t even bother with), and if they call that just staying home, and wonder whether he should be in school, or whether they should be making him do differently. that is not the sort of partnership and cooperation, appreciation, abundance and graditude that should be underpinning the game play and reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWHY would a child watch TV like a zombie after six or seven hours at school?  Escape.  Recovery.  Privacy/solitude.<br/>\nWhy would an unschooled child watch TV?  Because of the many options available, that’s the one that’s interesting to him or her at that moment.  It can be turned off, or left on, without regard to “school night” or homework or what day of the week it is.  It’s just one of many things, if the child’s life is safe and secure and full of options.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So for example I get comfortable when I hear no limits to screen time because my son (11) is an avid gamer.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing advice to let him play if he wants to should not be the same as “hearing no limits.”  <br/>\nHear choices.

I&#39;m the host, Kai&#39;s a host to his friends. We&#39;d do things that made our guests feel comfortable and welcome. That\n might mean coaching Kai before people come over. It might mean putting out monkey platters of food so everyone is happy. If you had an adult friend coming over who was a vegetarian, surely you would accommodate that choice, not make them eat meat?&nbsp;So why wouldn&#39;t\n you accommodate the wishes of your kids friends and their parents?&nbsp;If you aren&#39;t willing to accommodate guests, then maybe your kids can go visit friends at their houses instead?</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>==All of my kids seem naturally shy or introverted, but am I making it worse by our lifestyle?==<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nI very much doubt that - people are who they are. Making an introvert go to school isn&#39;t going to make them any less an introvert.<br>\n<br>\n== or even to follow common social behaviors such as saying &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; put them at a disadvantage? ==<br>\n<br>\nThat could put kids at a disadvantage, I think? It depends where and when they are refusing to do it. We don&#39;t live in a bubble where manners don&#39;t exist. I don&#39;t make Kai say please and thank-you to us, at home (though he often does), but I do coach him when\n we are on our way somewhere when someone will expect it (Nana&#39;s, other adults,etc...)...if he forgets (which happens less often now he&#39;s older) I say it for him.<br>\n<br>\n==When I have guests in our home, I let them know that we will respect their rules for their children and I will do what feels respectful to accommodate them, but this does not mean I will force my kids to stay off of their iPad or force my kids to play outside.==<br>\n<br>\nYou don&#39;t have to force anyone...but you can coach them before friends come over. Ask them what might be fun things to do. Suggest after a while on iPads or computers they might go outside or go for a bike ride or a walk. If Kai&#39;s got a friend coming over,\n I often ask what he thinks might be fun things to do while that friend is here - often if all they&#39;ve done is played a video game, they&#39;ll be mad when it&#39;s time to go home because they wanted to do other stuff - so we now plan in advance, and if he asks me\n to, I offer reminders about the other things they wanted to do.&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>== My son is not interested in &quot;educational games&quot; or classes. ==&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">If he&#39;s unschooled, why would he need to be? Why are you separating games into &#39;educational&#39; or otherwise?<br>\n<br>\n== He doesn&#39;t seem interested in learning so that he can become more independent and less dependent on me. ==<br>\n<br>\nHe&#39;s 11. Why would he want to become more independent from you at this age? I&#39;m sure he will in time - in his own time.</span></div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>== I have to quiz him regularly, because he still forgets it. I really wonder if there&#39;s anything I can do differently, because I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s at a disadvantage and of course I want him to have abilities and knowledge that he will need as he matures.==<br>\n<br>\nIt sounds here like you&#39;ve been swayed by the pediatrician...it sounds very old fashioned - I&#39;ve never even considered having Kai memorise my number...(though he does know our address). There are lots of other options that don&#39;t require memorizing a phone number.\n Most phones you can program a number into it (which is what we did when Kai was left home alone for the first times - we programmed in mine, my husbands, and Nana&#39;s numbers). If he uses a computer while you are out, he can skype you, and you can skype him.\n Far better and easier than calling, and also free. If he&#39;s 11, he&#39;ll probably be getting his own phone soon, so you could text him and he will have your number in his contacts.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>==Our son also doesn&#39;t like to wash. He has entered puberty, and starts to smell really badly. My husband and I let it go until he starts to smell so badly that everyone in the family is complaining about it. I also talked to my son&#39;s new pediatrician\n and he gave several reasons why it is good to wash regularly, but my son doesn&#39;t see value in doing so==<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nIf he&#39;s not leaving the house, at this point I wouldn&#39;t worry. When he becomes interested romantically in someone, i&#39;m sure he&#39;ll find value in being clean. Bicarb soda is a great deodorant for men (and women!), if you can encourage him to dust some on in the\n mornings.<br>\n<br>\n==This reminds me of our tooth hygiene story with him. He fought tooth care no matter how fun I tried to make it, and I never forced him. Eventually, he had multiple cavities and 2 infections.==<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nMore likely due to genetics than to tooth hygiene. But again, in their early teens, most kids become much more aware of most hygiene issues. As a child I barely brushed my teeth, as a teenager I was brushing them about 5 times a day.<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>==but perhaps I am not doing enough or taking a firm enough stance with him???&nbsp;The girls are very different and seem to appreciate and use the advice or instruction ==<br>\n<br>\nDon&#39;t &#39;take a firm stance&#39;. Don&#39;t instruct him. Be a better partner to him. Coach him on social etiquette and expectations. Help him make his house a cool place for his friends to hang out, without their parents getting upset.

I have wondered if I am doing my kids a disservice by raising them in a way that makes them obviously\n different and therefore less approachable. Are they less socially aware than their peers and so less likely to be invited to parties or accepted in a group environment? All of my kids seem naturally shy or introverted, but am I making it worse by our lifestyle?\n Am I putting them at a disadvantage? Does the fact that I don&#39;t force them to talk to others or spend time with others or even to follow common social behaviors such as saying &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; put them at a disadvantage? I inform them about what are\n the kind, social, respectful, empathic things to do, but they do not necessarily do it. When I have guests in our home, I let them know that we will respect their rules for their children and I will do what feels respectful to accommodate them, but this does\n not mean I will force my kids to stay off of their iPad or force my kids to play outside.</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">My daughters love being involved in things outside of the house, so I am not as concerned about them, but my son prefers to stay home, and I wonder if there is enough here for him at home. My husband and I can only give him\n so much. He only has one real life friend his age. He has a few gaming buddies. My son digs in his heals and resists leaving the house unless it fulfills an obvious personal need or desire for him. He is not interested in reading or learning other skills that\n I consider &quot;basic,&quot; such as telling time or how a calendar works or money. He&#39;s 11. I have tried many different ways to make these things fun, but perhaps his brain is not ready, because he checks out when I give any sort of instruction or start trying to\n explain how something works or anything other than just answering his question. My son is not interested in &quot;educational games&quot; or classes. One unschooling friend observed that he is &quot;averse to instruction&quot; (from anyone, not just me). He prefers to dive into\n things in a way that seems very experimental and disorganized rather than building on what others already know or following a system. He doesn&#39;t seem interested in learning so that he can become more independent and less dependent on me.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">One example of this huge difference between him and what seems more typical for children is how he learned/didn&#39;t learn my phone number. I&#39;ve tried to get him to memorize my phone number since he was 6 (thinking it could be\n a safety precaution, feeling pressure from his pediatrician that this was something a child should know, thinking it could lead to more independence for him...). When he was 8 and his little sisters were 3 and 5, they learned my phone number, but he still\n couldn&#39;t get it. Finally, when he was 10, it was clear he was ready to stay home, wanted to stay home and hated going out with us for the girls&#39; activities. I told him I was not comfortable leaving him home if he was unable to call me. We also made sure he\n knew some other safety precautions to take in an emergency and he did memorize my phone number and show ability to dial it. I have to quiz him regularly, because he still forgets it. I really wonder if there&#39;s anything I can do differently, because I&#39;m afraid\n he&#39;s at a disadvantage and of course I want him to have abilities and knowledge that he will need as he matures.</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">Our son also doesn&#39;t like to wash. He has entered puberty, and starts to smell really badly. My husband and I let it go until he starts to smell so badly that everyone in the family is complaining about it. I also talked to\n my son&#39;s new pediatrician and he gave several reasons why it is good to wash regularly, but my son doesn&#39;t see value in doing so. This reminds me of our tooth hygiene story with him. He fought tooth care no matter how fun I tried to make it, and I never forced\n him. Eventually, he had multiple cavities and 2 infections. That experience was traumatic and he ended up going under general anesthesia to get the fillings and extractions done. Afterwards, he started taking impeccable care of his teeth and is still pretty\n good about it, but needs reminders. When I talk to him about the experience and ask if I could have done anything differently to get him to brush his teeth back then, he says, &quot;no.&quot; He doesn&#39;t seem to think it was my responsibility nor has the opportunity\n made him any more likely to heed advice from his father and I. Our son does not change his ways unless he sees an immediate problem or benefit.</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">So far, my way has been to accept and allow and just remain in conversation with him, but perhaps I am not doing enough or taking a firm enough stance with him??? The girls are very different and seem to appreciate and use\n the advice or instruction that they are given by adults. In fact, in all of the activities and classes they have chosen, they are &quot;model students&quot; and very easy to parent relative to my son.</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">Anjelika</div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">(ds 11, dd 7, dd 5, always unschooled)</div>\n<span style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</div>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\">\n</p>\n</span>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255);height:0px;line-height:1.22em;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n \n</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":330670108,"authorName":"","from":"joyauxjo@...","profile":"nuttyaspecanpie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457032297","msgId":76842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5iYTI5OStzZjhnbDVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76841,"nextInTopic":76843,"prevInTime":76841,"nextInTime":76843,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m going to ask a few more specific questions about my 11yo son.

Wanting to be in a loving, trusting, appreciative place, and if I can wash away or do something about the concerns that sour my being from time to time, that would be great!</div><div><br></div><div>Is it okay that he is not interested in knowing how to tell time, count money, read, and other such &quot;basics&quot; that his schooled peers are learning or already know? Is it okay that I just let him stay home, because that&#39;s what he wants to do? Is there any point at which I need to reconsider this approach, such as in after a year or 2 years or 5 years? Or just wait for him to express a need? Do others have stories of children who were introverted like this, perhaps melancholic, but still content/fulfilled and were they able to feel successful and function well as adults (by their own standards)?</div><div><br></div><div>Even though my husband is more like our son than I am, my husband also struggles with what seems like lack of passion in our son. We agree that when we or anyone is talking to our son about his few&nbsp;specific interests or doing something that he specifically enjoys (the same interests he&#39;s had since he was 3), then our son is passionate and engaged, but he is otherwise uninterested, melancholic, resistant. Is this okay or do we need to do something other than what we are doing, which is to&nbsp;do activities with him&nbsp;that he already knows and is interested in? Those activities are: playing video games, building and talking about Bionicles or Transformers, playing with the cat, watching movies, eating, playing outside at home, building Lego creations, watching YouTube videos. Sometimes, when the weather is nice, he likes to go on hikes or visit parks. Sometimes we go swimming. Sometimes, he hangs out at work with his dad. The people he interacts with regularly&nbsp;are the 4 of us and his best friend who lives across the street. His friend comes over here and our son doesn&#39;t like going there, which has led to his friend&#39;s feelings being hurt, but I think the friend has accepted this for now. Our son also has gaming buddies online and interacts with other gamers online. He is quite the leader and a very skilled gamer! He gets invites to play with all sorts of teams and with his dad working in the industry, he always knows about the newest and greatest gaming anything. With all of the YouTube videos he watches, he often knows about more than his father. Or shocks his father by talking about something that&#39;s still supposed to be a secret but somehow got leaked on YouTube! :D He&#39;s really fun when doing things he chooses!</div><div><br></div><div>Now that I am writing this out, I am also realizing that part of my concern is that he seems so inflexible. For example, we have been to one of the Disney Parks every year for the past 7 years. That is his only family vacation choice. He gets upset whenever we talk about going someplace else. We have also been on a couple road trips, and once we&#39;re on the road, he enjoys several aspects of the trip, seems to benefit from the trip and recalls good memories from the trip. However, he gets mad at the suggestion of another road trip, or any other vacation other than Disney. He is not open to discussion, so if&nbsp;the rest of the family wants&nbsp;to visit another place, we don&#39;t get any input from him. He stonewalls. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s wrong and he needs to change. It is frustrating, but we know how to focus on what we enjoy about him, and I&#39;m just looking for perspectives on this with the intention of letting go of residual doubts that spoil my own peace-of-mind.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for your time and attention and for keeping these discussions so alive! Please know in your responses that my intention is to love my kids as well as I can -- to make sure they feel my love and know that I am here to help them thrive if they need me.</div><div><br></div><div>Anjelika :)<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-557319966yui-cursor\"></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1457030766","msgId":76833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCNTc2NTk5LTI1MkYtNEEyMS05RTc3LURCM0U3ODdGNzg0MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5iOXVpMCtzY3N0aXRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QTM0QjI1QUUtMjQ1Ri00REQyLTg2N0QtQzk5NjY3MDk1OUZBQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8bmI5dWkwK3Njc3RpdEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76831,"nextInTopic":76834,"prevInTime":76832,"nextInTime":76834,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I hope please is fading from use.

Is his world rich enough just from what we create at home and the limited amount that he goes out? I guess you are telling me &quot;yes.&quot; A few weeks ago, a new friend who I introduced to unschooling, walked into our home and called it a &quot;haven for children.&quot; Years ago, another friend told me that I was giving my children what she wanted to give her children. So, I guess my post is more about me worrying than there actually being a problem. I think that was my only reason for posting. I have not checked in with an unschooling group lately (just reading here), and some of Sandra&#39;s recent comments had me wondering if I was doing enough, or if I was fun enough or if I should be providing opportunitites I hadn&#39;t thought of yet. I will go read on your website, Joyce, which I have never visited before, and see if I have other specific questions about any specific problems, as you suggested.</div><div><span title=\"ireply\"><br></span></div><div>&gt;&gt;They don&#39;t need to be *made* fun. They need to be useful to him. Or inherently fun. &lt;&lt;</div><div><br></div><div>I have seen Sandra comment a couple of times about it being important for the parents to make unschooling more fun than going to school, so that is why I needed to bring out that idea. I remember one time Sandra telling a woman, &quot;You&#39;re not making it fun enough.&quot; This is where I got the idea that it&#39;s my job to make things&nbsp;fun and wondering if I was not&nbsp;doing enough because my son definitely doesn&#39;t think learning to read or&nbsp;tell time or count money is fun.&nbsp;I feel like I&#39;ve tried to make things fun for him, but he does not find my ideas &quot;fun.&quot; I think that&#39;s okay. He is still having fun and making his own fun. When I see he enjoys something, I bring more of that into his life.</div><div><br></div><div>As for whether or not these things are useful, I definitely think they are useful to him. He thinks they are useful, as well, but doesn&#39;t feel any drive to learn them at this point.&nbsp;When I talk with him about it, I am careful to remain kind and curious, not to use an accusatory tone, but just trying to figure out what he&#39;s thinking, if he&#39;s thought about it at all, to see if he had ideas about it or would like anything else from me. He seems confident that he will eventually learn these things, and doesn&#39;t want to do anything about it now.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div> &gt;&gt;You seem to want him to learn differently, in a way that&#39;s more satisfying for your needs.&lt;&lt;</div><div><br></div><div>No. I want him to be able to satisfy his own needs and to feel successful as an adult. I don&#39;t want him to feel disadvantaged when he is an adult, so this is why I am trying to cover these bases, address these concerns. Your responses are telling me that I am already doing what he needs, which eases my concerns... at least for now ;)<br><br>&gt;&gt;Why would serious stuff be more important than what she would eagerly pull in?&lt;&lt;</div><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s not. <br></div><blockquote><div><span title=\"ireply\"><br></span>&gt;&gt;You already know he doesn&#39;t like instruction and pressure. Why does it surprise you that instruction and pressure created resistance?&gt;&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t think I was surprised. Did I express that I was surprised? What I do feel pleasantly surprised and relieved about is the idea that he does not need to know my number by heart. You are the 3rd person here who has offered alternatives that seem just as good, and that is a great take-away for me.<br><br>&gt;&gt;My feeling is you have a cat. But all you know is dog training. And you&#39;re certain all the things dogs need you must teach your son as you&#39;d teach a dog. He resists. Rather than learning from him and adjusting, you&#39;re confused why these methods aren&#39;t working and seeing him as at fault.&lt;&lt;</div><div><br></div><div>I do not see him as at fault. I am aware that I am very different from him and he is very different from my other 2 children and that I need to continually work to understand him and to adjust for his needs. I would never even think of &quot;training&quot; children. I don&#39;t like that word, used on children. My mother uses that word.&nbsp;I thought I was describing the situation, describing how he is and describing how things are now and asking for input about what I am missing. I am not &quot;certain all the things dogs need I must teach my son&quot; and dog training is not all I know. :D Would it help you feel better if I now created a post about everything that is going well?</div><div><br></div><div>I have to remember that I tend to post only when I have a concern, worrying and feeling confused, which makes me seem like I am doing things wrong or thinking in the wrong way.</div><div><br></div><div>I do agree with your assessment that I was feeling confused. This is one of the reasons I posted, but I am getting clarity thanks to your statements. I can see what is NOT true of me and my son and I can also see that I can return to trust and I can see that letting go of the phone number issue (and such things) is okay.<br><br>&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve written these issues all together as though you&#39;re asking how to push his reset button. &lt;&lt;</div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s an interesting perspective.

I agree with this. I used to fear that if my son had to call 911, he would need to know his address, but an officer told me they can trace all stationary numbers. It&#39;s only hard to trace a cell phone on the move. I let that go. And I&#39;ve never thought he needed to know our home number. I do feel like I want my contact info easily available if needed. I&#39;ve seen it come in handy with other children and think of it as an obvious safety precaution, but in his case, it is not an easy one. Some ideas I have now are to get him a cell phone (not something he cares about for his own use) and/or to tape my cell number around the house in many locations for easy access. I still think knowing my number would be good in case he gets lost when we are out or traveling, visiting amusement parks, etc.... He&#39;s funny! He says, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mom, I won&#39;t get lost.&quot; Such confidence and humor! :D<br/>\n<br/>\nAnjelika</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":577089634,"authorName":"Clare Kirkpatrick","from":"Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;claremkirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Am I putting my kids at a disadvantage?","postDate":"1456988158","msgId":76827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT3V3UDZXMz1ieHRMVj14MCtVYTBTNGs1MzFPaTkrNVV2UUZ5SmZkcDN6cy1aclNBZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5iN2xtcCs2Yzc3NHNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76826,"nextInTopic":76829,"prevInTime":76826,"nextInTime":76828,"topicId":76826,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The phone number thing: I was telling my oldest (12) about how we all needed to know our home phone number when I was growing up.

I have wondered if I am doing my kids a disservice by raising them in a way that makes them obviously different and therefore less approachable. Are they less socially aware than their peers and so less likely to be invited to parties or accepted in a group environment? All of my kids seem naturally shy or introverted, but am I making it worse by our lifestyle? Am I putting them at a disadvantage? Does the fact that I don&#39;t force them to talk to others or spend time with others or even to follow common social behaviors such as saying &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; put them at a disadvantage? I inform them about what are the kind, social, respectful, empathic things to do, but they do not necessarily do it. When I have guests in our home, I let them know that we will respect their rules for their children and I will do what feels respectful to accommodate them, but this does not mean I will force my kids to stay off of their iPad or force my kids to play outside.</div><div><br></div><div>My daughters love being involved in things outside of the house, so I am not as concerned about them, but my son prefers to stay home, and I wonder if there is enough here for him at home. My husband and I can only give him so much. He only has one real life friend his age. He has a few gaming buddies. My son digs in his heals and resists leaving the house unless it fulfills an obvious personal need or desire for him. He is not interested in reading or learning other skills that I consider &quot;basic,&quot; such as telling time or how a calendar works or money. He&#39;s 11. I have tried many different ways to make these things fun, but perhaps his brain is not ready, because he checks out when I give any sort of instruction or start trying to explain how something works or anything other than just answering his question. My son is not interested in &quot;educational games&quot; or classes. One unschooling friend observed that he is &quot;averse to instruction&quot; (from anyone, not just me). He prefers to dive into things in a way that seems very experimental and disorganized rather than building on what others already know or following a system. He doesn&#39;t seem interested in learning so that he can become more independent and less dependent on me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One example of this huge difference between him and what seems more typical for children is how he learned/didn&#39;t learn my phone number. I&#39;ve tried to get him to memorize my phone number since he was 6 (thinking it could be a safety precaution, feeling pressure from his pediatrician that this was something a child should know, thinking it could lead to more independence for him...). When he was 8 and his little sisters were 3 and 5, they learned my phone number, but he still couldn&#39;t get it. Finally, when he was 10, it was clear he was ready to stay home, wanted to stay home and hated going out with us for the girls&#39; activities. I told him I was not comfortable leaving him home if he was unable to call me. We also made sure he knew some other safety precautions to take in an emergency and he did memorize my phone number and show ability to dial it. I have to quiz him regularly, because he still forgets it. I really wonder if there&#39;s anything I can do differently, because I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s at a disadvantage and of course I want him to have abilities and knowledge that he will need as he matures.</div><div><br></div><div>Our son also doesn&#39;t like to wash. He has entered puberty, and starts to smell really badly. My husband and I let it go until he starts to smell so badly that everyone in the family is complaining about it. I also talked to my son&#39;s new pediatrician and he gave several reasons why it is good to wash regularly, but my son doesn&#39;t see value in doing so. This reminds me of our tooth hygiene story with him. He fought tooth care no matter how fun I tried to make it, and I never forced him. Eventually, he had multiple cavities and 2 infections. That experience was traumatic and he ended up going under general anesthesia to get the fillings and extractions done. Afterwards, he started taking impeccable care of his teeth and is still pretty good about it, but needs reminders. When I talk to him about the experience and ask if I could have done anything differently to get him to brush his teeth back then, he says, &quot;no.&quot; He doesn&#39;t seem to think it was my responsibility nor has the opportunity made him any more likely to heed advice from his father and I. Our son does not change his ways unless he sees an immediate problem or benefit.</div><div><br></div><div>So far, my way has been to accept and allow and just remain in conversation with him, but perhaps I am not doing enough or taking a firm enough stance with him??? The girls are very different and seem to appreciate and use the advice or instruction that they are given by adults. In fact, in all of the activities and classes they have chosen, they are &quot;model students&quot; and very easy to parent relative to my son.</div><div><br></div><div>Anjelika</div><div>(ds 11, dd 7, dd 5, always unschooled)</div><span><div><br></div><p><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1201586928yui-cursor\"></p></span></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76934,"nextTopicId":76957}}
