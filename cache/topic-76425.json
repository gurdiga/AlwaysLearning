It’s very often important for a parent to encourage a child to do something—to persuade, to cheer on, to inspire.  To call it “sales pitch” deflates all the potential joy and progress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Family travel","postDate":"1449939952","msgId":76442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1QzExMTEyLTQ3OUQtNDYxNC1BQUYyLUFDQTNGN0Y5MUU4OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG40Z2dvZCsxOTd2OTZqQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG40ZWkyMCsxNzIxZTAzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPG40Z2dvZCsxOTd2OTZqQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76441,"nextInTopic":76443,"prevInTime":76441,"nextInTime":76443,"topicId":76425,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Caryn’s notes were great, and this could help:  armed with gum and phone numbers to call home and her trusty Panda, she was able to travel across the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157431082\">Caryn’s notes were great, and this could help:  &quot;armed with gum and phone numbers to call home and her trusty Panda, she was able to travel across the country on wings of excitement instead of trapped in the clutches of her fears. “<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds morbid, but crossing the ocean is spooky, and it might make a child feel better to have information ON her—name, parents’ names, contact at the destination with phone number, etc.  And first I thought a laminated card.    But I have another idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids fly I make a laminated luggage tag with their information and their host family information on one side, and the flight numbers and times on the other.  I have a laminating machine, and a hole punch, and ribbon, so it might not be as easy for someone who doesn’t have those things, but it’s doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for a younger child over water, there’s another idea, also from something we used to do.  Write on a white men’s handkerchief or a scarf with a sharpie, and tie it on the child’s neck.  When my kids went to crowded places with other families (state fair, amusement park, a city event) I would make one for each with his name, my name and phone number and the host mom’s name and phone number.  If they got separated or hurt, someone could contact one or both of the adults.  It made me feel better, and made them feel better. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor someone who sews, a 25” square of white cloth, hemmed or stabilized some way, with writing along the edges, could be pretty, even, with a colored sharpie, and waterproof. And can be kept as a souvenir.    The advantage of a real cotton handkerchief is that the cloth is very thin and designed to be washed and to dry quickly and easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I was to give a short speech in a ceremony.  I wrote it around the edge of a handkerchief, turned the cloth in my hands and read it, without it being obvious that I was doing so, and then gave it to the honoree afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility if the child doesn’t want to wear a scarf and the parents don’t have lamination and hole-punching equipment might be to write on the child with a Sharpie (sharp-tipped permanent marker).  That will last a day or two, and if it makes her feel more secure, that someone would know who she was in an emergency, it might be an easy solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Family travel","postDate":"1449939936","msgId":76441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6cDgzZk9DWGtoUzRWTGlfNE5zUD02ZkdVWVhWWVZIYUhvOTIyQkVIVWI5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJCM0YwODlFLTQ1MDgtNEIyNy05MTE1LTczNDA1QkYwM0Q4RUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDJCM0YwODlFLTQ1MDgtNEIyNy05MTE1LTczNDA1QkYwM0Q4RUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76440,"nextInTopic":76442,"prevInTime":76440,"nextInTime":76442,"topicId":76425,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just thought of something else, I don t know if it would be helpful, but it might be fun.

If she is afraid of the ocean, you could watch movies or read books about happy times at the beach. Maybe she has a fear of sharks or of deep water or something.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m wrong and she just doesn&#39;t like the beach.&nbsp; Just some thoughts to consider.&nbsp; </span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2886\" dir=\"ltr\"><span></span><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2876\" dir=\"ltr\"><span></span><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2813\" dir=\"ltr\"><span></span><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2814\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></div><br>  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2602\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica Neue Light, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2601\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2600\" dir=\"ltr\"> <font id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2599\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"> <hr size=\"1\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2659\"> <b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">From:</span></b> &quot;jessiwoodman@...

My oldest daughter is 8 and is having a lot of angst about the trip. She doesn&#39;t want to fly over the ocean, she&#39;s worried about her ears equalizing on the plane and she doesn&#39;t want to go to the beach (where the family spends two out of the four weeks of our trip). It seems like the two of us keep having the same conversation over and over and maybe that&#39;s what needs to happen, but I feel &#39;stuck.&#39; I don&#39;t know how to love her very well through

I used to get motion sickness when I was younger, and anxiety, and would take dramamine.  For young kids, I don’t know if half a tab would do.  Benedryl is another possibility, if it will make her sleepy.   Maybe you could experiment on a day when she has nowhere to go.  If she takes it at home and it relaxes her or induces a nap, you both might feel better about the possibility of using it again on the flight.  If she has a different reaction, you’ll know in advance and not risk learning that on the plane. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find and audiobook she would really like, that might help.

If you KNOW, then why would you press her to go?   A few times when one of three children balked, I sometimes said I hadn’t gotten to do much as a child that was this cool, and talk it up as a thing I would’ve liked to have done and how excited I would have been.  The emotion from me of “how cool” was honest, and not projected on that child. It wasn’t “This will be fun,” it was “When I was a kid, I would have really been excited if…”<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":405187095,"authorName":"","from":"jessiwoodman@...","profile":"jessi_woodman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Family travel","postDate":"1449839499","msgId":76425,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG40ZWkyMCsxNzIxZTAzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76426,"prevInTime":76424,"nextInTime":76426,"topicId":76425,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our family is traveling to Australia (where my husband is from and his family live) at the end of the month.
