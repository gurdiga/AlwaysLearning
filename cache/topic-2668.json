So many moms are not breastfeeding today.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was a baby, we went to a family reuinion in Texas.  He was four <br/>\nmonths old. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in a big hall, and there were 120 people or so in there at the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he wanted to nurse, I carried him back to the farthest wall from where <br/>\nmost people were, and I nursed him while reading a bulletin board and from a <br/>\ndistance others probably thought I was just rocking him to sleep, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy grandmother, who was 82 or so, came back there and looked at the bulletin <br/>\nboard too.  It was a kind of &quot;leaning on a truck&quot; moment  (as in <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck)\">http://sandradodd.com/truck)</a><br/>\nand she said, &quot;Good for you.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut her next statement was &quot;I don&#39;t know WHY those other mothers won&#39;t FEED <br/>\nTHEIR BABIES.&quot;  There were two other infants in the room, both being bottle <br/>\nfed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked what you wrote.  Good story, Joylyn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was at the Wyoming branch of the library one day here, when Kirby was <br/>\nlittle.  Not walking, but bigger.  Maybe nine months?  I should look it up, <br/>\nif I wrote it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn older woman kept looking at him and watching us, and finally she asked me <br/>\nhow old he was.  I told her.  She said her daughter had married and was <br/>\nliving in Norway, I think she said (a Scandinavian country) and had had a <br/>\nbaby boy that age, but she, the grandmother, hadn&#39;t gotten to see him yet, <br/>\nand was having a hard time imagining how big he was, and might not get to see <br/>\nhim for another year.  She seemed really sad.  When we said goodbye and <br/>\nparted, I thought...  I turned back quickly and said &quot;Would you like to hold <br/>\nhim?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just lit up and was SO happy to have that surrogate moment.  It was sweet <br/>\nfor me to watch her be so happy to  hold Kirby in place of one she wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nget to hold at that age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10804628,"authorName":"birdiebutt2001","from":"&quot;birdiebutt2001&quot; &lt;katguts@...&gt;","profile":"birdiebutt2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: breastfeeding","postDate":"1029665646","msgId":8575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqbnMxZSt2dDBnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMyNDNkMiQyZGYxYTcwMCQxNWM0NjBjYkBlNnU0djg+"},"prevInTopic":8560,"nextInTopic":10929,"prevInTime":8574,"nextInTime":8576,"topicId":2668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My biggest sweet tooth is 29 and still... er... well i guess that s not techniically nursing id it ;)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1549263810\">My biggest sweet tooth is 29 and still... er... well i guess that&#39;s <br/>\nnot techniically nursing id it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My biggest sweet tooth is 4 1/2 and still nursing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jacqui<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My biggest sweet tooth is 38 months and still nursing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Backs was  breastfeeding","postDate":"1029430581","msgId":8560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODE1MTY1NjIxLjU2MTcwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYyLjI0Mzg3YTAxLjJhOGQxNmY1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8557,"nextInTopic":8575,"prevInTime":8559,"nextInTime":8561,"topicId":2668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
