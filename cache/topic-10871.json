She was the most beautiful<br/>\nand really lovely person I&#39;ve ever known.  She was funny and loving and<br/>\nan amazing cook.   <br/>\nHe had met her Large, extended family while they were dating, but after<br/>\nhe proposed, he invited everyone out to dinner.   On the way they stopped<br/>\ninto a department store and everyone looked around and had a nice time.  <br/>\n At dinner, in the restaurant my uncle was presented with many gifts from<br/>\nthe various relatives, none gift wrapped &lt;g&gt; many with the price tags<br/>\nstill on.  Everyone was so happy and loving and thrilled to be able to<br/>\ngive him something.   This was 1948 or &#39;49.   Quite an evening for my<br/>\nuncle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were married until he died in 1993.   She died a few years later. <br/>\nThey had wonderful kids and a happy life and developed and maintained a<br/>\nstrict family policy of NO stealing.  One that could never be enforced<br/>\nwith the rest of her family.    Nice folks except for that one little<br/>\nthing.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\nOne of my aunts sisters is still alive, living in California, and she<br/>\nwrites and calls and stays in touch with the rest of the family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10699,"nextTopicId":10804}}
