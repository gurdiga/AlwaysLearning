My favorite side effect of unschooling is the habit of giving every thought the &quot;inspection&quot;.  Changing one&#39;s paradigm on learning seems to infect how one looks at everything.  I love reading about all the angles that thoughtful people have discovered on a given topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanora, the TV hater, has enjoyed the discussion along with me.  Even though it is not one of her favorites, she can tell you how valuable it can be as a learning tool.  She does love movies though and will watch MAD TV, CSI or the comedy channel.  I doubt she would ever be able to limit her own children&#39;s TV and lamely justify doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.6.13 - Release Date: 1/16/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unassailable demons","postDate":"1105989560","msgId":21566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxLjFmNGMxYWY1LjJmMWQ2OWI4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21572,"prevInTime":21565,"nextInTime":21567,"topicId":21566,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/16/2005 6:54:11 P.M.
