At<br/>\nthe school they attended there are several levels before &quot;College Algebra&quot;<br/>\nwhich is the first transferable college course.  The classes were indeed<br/>\nfilled with kids who had attended school for 13 years...........including<br/>\nsome with high school diplomas and transcripts listing them as &quot;honors&quot;<br/>\ngraduates.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son moved up a level just a couple of  meetings in by doing a class<br/>\nplacement test rather the college placement test.  There were a few weeks of<br/>\nstruggling to &quot;learn the language&quot; but he finished that course and<br/>\nsubsequent courses at the top of the remaining students (the class size<br/>\ndiminishes pretty fast in some of these courses).  I don&#39;t remember the<br/>\nexact course, but it was pretty early in the &quot;real&quot; college level courses<br/>\nthat he &quot;came out&quot; when a prof asked where he had gone to high school since<br/>\nhe seemed to have such a great foundation :-).   I believe it is because he<br/>\ndid not have to &quot;unlearn&quot; a lot of confused concepts.    He moved on to<br/>\nhigher math, transferring to University in the mathematics department and<br/>\nthen securing a very coveted and competitive slot in the computer science<br/>\ndepartment which is what his Bachelor&#39;s Degree is in.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext son  &quot;dual-enrolled&quot; in community college so he was able to &quot;count&quot; the<br/>\nDevelopmental Courses   on a high school transcript, just not transferable<br/>\nto University.    He had similar experiences as far as finishing each course<br/>\nwith an &quot;A&quot; (including when he moved on to College Algebra, Trig, Calculus)<br/>\nbut, to his brother&#39;s chagrin, decided that it was not necessary to continue<br/>\nto have &quot;at least&quot; ONE math course each semester &quot;for fun&quot; forever and<br/>\never.  His tastes ran more to laboratory science courses.   However, the<br/>\nlast few semesters at community college  he was hired as a math tutor in the<br/>\ncommunity college Learning Lab.........a position usually reserved for upper<br/>\nlevel University students or University graduates.   He actually earned an<br/>\nAssociate&#39;s Degree (and had to decide whether to list Chemistry, Biology, or<br/>\nMathematics as the &quot;major&quot;) before he transferred to a University to earn<br/>\nhis Bachelors Degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that without any formal structured Mathematics classes before<br/>\nentering community college, both were able to &quot;catch up&quot; to &quot;graduates&quot; of<br/>\n13+ years in less than a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159184374,"authorName":"elwazani","from":"&quot;elwazani&quot; &lt;elwazani@...&gt;","profile":"elwazani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Turning unschooling into a transcript?!?","postDate":"1217558726","msgId":36932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2dHRjNis5NTVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxMENCREQwLTBGQTktNDM1Qy04M0NCLURFOEIzNENGMUUyNkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36931,"nextInTopic":36933,"prevInTime":36931,"nextInTime":36933,"topicId":36927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... things ...
