This was the sentence that I overheard that really caught<br/>\n&gt; my attention. At the end of our school&#39;s PTA meeting, several of us<br/>\n&gt; began talking about the soaring costs of everything, one of the<br/>\n&gt; members told us how she is saving a tremendous amount of money on<br/>\n&gt; groceries, eating out, pictures and just about everything else you<br/>\n&gt; could imagine. To make a long story short, she said she joined a<br/>\n&gt; program at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://couponsforlife.com\">http://couponsforlife.com</a> She told us that the sampler<br/>\n&gt; package includes savings on just about everything you could imagine.<br/>\n&gt; I was shocked she joined since I have known this woman a very long<br/>\n&gt; time and she has always been a huge skeptic. I asked her what made<br/>\n&gt; her decide to join this. She told me she checked the company out with<br/>\n&gt; the better business bureau who verified that they have been in<br/>\n&gt; business since Oct. 1983 and they have an outstanding record with<br/>\n&gt; them. She said she also checked them out with Paypal who processes<br/>\n&gt; their payments and Paypal informed her that the company has provided<br/>\n&gt; all business paperwork, and has had several thousand customers<br/>\n&gt; through their payment process. They went on to say that they offer a<br/>\n&gt; guarantee for this company&#39;s products. In her words, that was enough<br/>\n&gt; for her to try them out and she &quot;has never been happier with a<br/>\n&gt; company&#39;s products&quot; in her life. The rest of us couldn&#39;t wait to sign<br/>\n&gt; up. She showed us some receipts in her bag and savings were eye<br/>\n&gt; popping!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
