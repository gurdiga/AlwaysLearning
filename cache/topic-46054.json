When it only went six inches or so,  <br/>\nwhen I would put it up in a ponytail it looked like a brown fake  <br/>\nponytail on a grey-haired person. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my friends have let their hair go grey when it did; many of  <br/>\nthem have long hair, too.<br/>\nI noticed a white part on a red-headed friend the other day.

(By the way, Sandra, I didn&#39;t think your comment came off that way.)  It&#39;s not really in my nature to put myself down, but more than that, I am always cognizant of the example I am setting for my teenage daughter (and all the young girls I work with). It&#39;s important to me to show my daughter that beauty is about so much more than physical appearance, and that it&#39;s okay to feel confident and present your true face to the world at every age. So few people do any more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just not for the faint of heart.:) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.smartingusup.blogspot.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46063,"nextTopicId":46084}}
