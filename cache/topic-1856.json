I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1621744430\">About religion and interests and preference and hard-wiring, here&#39;s something <br/>\nto think about by Dean Sluyter.  I&#39;ve mentioned him.  I&#39;ll mention him again. <br/>\n I have a tie-in for you for the poop thread (later).  He has a website.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.cosmicbook.com<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, from _The Zen Commandments_, page 94-95 (with *x* for italics; sorry)...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our impulse toward devotion, I suspect, is so deeply ingrained that we all <br/>\nlook for objects toward which to direct it.  We&#39;re built for it the way birds <br/>\nare built for flight; without millions of devotees, neither Beatlemania nor <br/>\nthe Roman Republic could have happened.  So the question is not *wheher* but <br/>\nto *what* or *whom* you will be devoted.  By harnessing our natural tendency <br/>\ntoward devotion and pointing it toward an appropriate object, we can put it <br/>\nto the service of liberation.  We can kiss the frog of warty, flawed <br/>\nexistence, freeing it--and ourselves--from the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is not merely an emotional or attitudinal shift, but a perceptual <br/>\ntransformation.  When I was ten years old I was a devoted coin collector and <br/>\nexperienced this in a small way.  Pennies, the most worthless of coins, began <br/>\nto reveal a greater value and beauty.  Through my focused enthusiasm (love) <br/>\nfor them, I literally started to see aspects I hadn&#39;t seen before:  this one <br/>\nwas in Extremely Fine condition because all the lines in the wheat stalks <br/>\nwere clear and sharp, that one was rare because it had the designer&#39;s <br/>\ninitials (V.D.B.) on the reverse.  My enhanced perception of the coins in <br/>\nturn fed my love for them, which further enhanced my perception, which in <br/>\nturn fed my love. . .<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In this way devotion becomes self-perpeuating.  If you just stay with it, <br/>\nkeep opening to the same object, your appreciation grows without limit.  You <br/>\nmany have experienced this with your children, your country, your work, your <br/>\nart.  If you&#39;re a devoted musician, you hear subtleties of rhythm and timbre <br/>\nthat other people don&#39;t; if you&#39;re an artist, you keep seeing light, shapes, <br/>\nand colors in new, vivid ways; if you&#39;re a fly fisherman, you know things <br/>\nabout the river that can&#39;t be put into words.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;in principle, it doesn&#39;t matter what the object of devotion is.  If we focus <br/>\nsteadfastly on any wave it will evenually be revealed as ocean.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1855,"nextTopicId":1862}}
