We have a great deal of diversity here, and I love how that is <br/>\ncelebrated. There are relatively few places where I feel so comfortable <br/>\nsharing details of my family&#39;s life, and find that rather than just being <br/>\ntolerated, it is honored.  I also appreciate a place where we can talk about <br/>\nour struggles with racism and other isms, and find ways to be with our kids <br/>\nso they will have a few less layers of this stuff to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are good people, and I am glad you&#39;re out there. Consider that you have a <br/>\nfriend near Boston if you want to visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who&#39;s been mushy lately<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11004,"nextTopicId":11011}}
