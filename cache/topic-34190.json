Kids often have an incomplete picture and are unable or unwilling to gain clarity <br/>\nof the situation.  A caring adult can do that, help with perspective and understanding so <br/>\nthat growth and compassion can come out of an ugly situation.  It takes an exceptionally <br/>\ntalented child at interpersonal interactions to pull that off at four years old.  I&#39;ve probably <br/>\nseen it, but mostly I&#39;ve seen kids five and under acting out their own feelings of hurt, <br/>\nanger, frustration and taking it out on the kids around them, because that&#39;s what kids <br/>\noften do.  They don&#39;t have the empathy yet to really be able to shift into seeing someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s point of view until their own is completely heard, and when you&#39;ve got two in that <br/>\nsame boat trying to work it out alone, you generally have blow ups that are preventable or <br/>\nfixable by an involved mom or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days playgroups are usually made of up like-age kids.  That is a school model.  <br/>\nPlaygroups with mixed ages are so much more functional in this area--sometimes some <br/>\nof the older kids will help the younger kids solve problems before they even come to the <br/>\nadults attention.

You can always tell when it really isn&#39;t working anymore <br/>\nand they need help--negotiations have fallen through and war is declared.  Nothing good <br/>\ncomes out of it for kids to keep going past this point.
