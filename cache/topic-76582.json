I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s hormonally driven - recent research shows that teens&#39; body clocks naturally shift later. For most of our kids their super late-night phases were fairly short-lived or else sporadic, because they didn&#39;t like the feeling of sleeping so much of the daylight away and/or had things to get up for and didn&#39;t like feeling fatigued.</div><div><br></div>However, this past year our youngest (13) has had this ongoing issue of sleeping in past when he &quot;wants&quot; to be up. He really likes routines and he especially loves his evening routine, which has come to include staying up well into the night watching his favorite Netflix shows. He loves cocooning with the dog and his TV in the quiet time when everyone else is asleep and hasn&#39;t wanted to give that up. Yet he would often regret it the next day if he slept too far into the afternoon. I offered many suggestions and we have tried different things that haven&#39;t consistently worked, and sometimes ideas he thought of or agreed to the night before would make him angry upon being implemented the next day. I told him it was asking too much for me to become his snooze alarm every morning - that I would wake him up when he wants me to, but it&#39;s up to him to move himself out of bed if he really wants to be up. Most of the time now I let him sleep (his choice) and he gets himself out of bed in time to not &quot;regret&quot; the time...though just two days ago he accidentally slept till 2:30. So he decided that from now on when the clock hits 2 AM he will finish whatever episode he&#39;s watching on Netflix and go to bed. I am interested to see if this new solution will take hold. &nbsp;<div><br><div>He has only one day a week when he has something scheduled that he needs to be up for, and he does tend to sleep through his alarm, so we always make sure someone wakes him up. On those days he prefers to be woken up with minimal time to get ready (15-20 minutes) so that he doesn&#39;t have time to lie in bed - he knows he has to move right away and he does, with minimal prompting.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>One idea I am going to suggest here is using an energizing blend of essential oils rubbed on the soles of the feet and insides of the wrists. I haven&#39;t done this for our son specifically as a wake up method, but there have been a few occasions where he was feeling very out-of-sorts, lying on the sofa extremely annoyed and apathetic, and when I rubbed one drop each of lemon and lavender oils (mixed in 1/2 tsp almond oil) onto his feet and wrists, in every case (despite his irritation and skepticism that it would make any difference) within 5 minutes he was on his feet with an idea for something to do and energy in his step. He was off and running. If the OP (or anyone) wants to try this, I strongly recommend going with oils from a company like Rocky Mountain Oils, Doterra, or Young Living, as they all use the highest standards for therapeutic grade oils, which is important for purity/effectiveness. RMO is my company of choice because their oils tend to be slightly less expensive and have free shipping in the States, and there is no membership needed for the best prices.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In a nutshell, I agree with Marty that when a child truly wants to be up - when their reason becomes compelling enough to them - they will make it happen.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>~ Leah<br><div><div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-764973468 .ygrps-yiv-764973468ExternalClass

Maybe if she goes in and says “Good morning!  The sun’s up.  Can I make you something for breakfast?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1477452950\">Holly thinks the mom’s planning to be too gentle.  Maybe if she goes in and says “Good morning!  The sun’s up.  Can I make you something for breakfast?  I’m looking forward to spending the day with you. Do you want a shower before you eat?&quot;  To get her thinking.  To show excitement, to show that it would be really nice for her to get up and start the day.  Enthusiasm.  Not to guilt her into getting up, but to show that she could affect the house and family in a positive way if she wants to get up.  To make her feel really welcomed to wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other idea (Holly said) is that the daughter said she felt like she was “wasting her day” because there’s not a lot of sunlight, but I have three different things to say about that.  <br/>\nThere are so many ways I do not see that as a waste of time.  If she’s staying up late, then that’s how she’s spending her time.  (Not wasting it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSleep is vital.  There is no person alive who doesn’t sleep.  Sleep isn’t a waste of time.  People are still alive when they’re asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom is recognizing that it’s natural, but the daughter isn’t really accepting of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the daughter’s perspective on things, Holly thinks that at night it’s daytime somewhere else and in the daytime, it’s nighttime somewhere else.  This might seem like total bullshit (said Holly) but the sun’s still shining when it’s dark.  So it’s not so important to measure time by the apparent sunlight.  The sun is infinitely shining. :-)  (Holly asked me to add that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she’s doing indoor activities, it will matter less whether it’s daylight.  If she wants to do outside activities, it’s understandable, but in the mom’s description of what she likes to do, those are things being done in the evening.  So she IS doing her activities during the day, but it’s daytime in Australia, or India (or the mom could mention any country on the other side of the world that the daughter has an interest in).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly thinks enthusiasm will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* think the smell of bacon and coffee can help.  Unless you’re Mormon, or Jewish, or Muslim, or vegetarian.   But there might be something else that smells good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the words above are Holly, me transcribing while she was on the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":577089634,"authorName":"Clare Kirkpatrick","from":"Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;claremkirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need help with how I view waking up in the morning","postDate":"1453830580","msgId":76584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT3V3UDZXbVM5Kzl5TitVd3I0MGtDLWk5Z3pGNHNDOXU2Q25KYjh1MjN6NGEzU3dGd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG44ODlocCtxOWFlZjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG44ODlocCtxOWFlZjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76583,"nextInTopic":76585,"prevInTime":76583,"nextInTime":76585,"topicId":76582,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Instead of going in, nudging her awake and leaving her to drift back to sleep, is there any reason you can t wake her by getting into bed with her with plenty","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1580933846\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of going in, nudging her awake and leaving her to drift back to sleep, is there any reason you can&#39;t wake her by getting into bed with her with plenty of time and facilitating a loving, connecting waking up with a cuddle and a chat about the day ahead or whatever? </p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1580933846gmail_quote\">On 26 Jan 2016 17:18, &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kjl8@...\">kjl8@...</a> [AlwaysLearning]&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1580933846gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n\n\n    <div>\n\n\n      <p><p><span>My daughter is 12.
