He&#39;s all about unschooling when it concerns learning but tends to be strict in all other areas. I&#39;ve tried just being a good example and I have seen some small changes in the way he responds to our son&#39;s behavior. I&#39;d love to see more. I think the key might be fear. He&#39;s afraid if our son isn&#39;t disciplined enough he&#39;ll be anti-social and not get along in the world. I think my husband is also afraid to lose what he perceives as control of the family. I know it&#39;s hard and I wish I had more for you. I did come across a website for unschooling dads is you think he&#39;d look at it. I&#39;ll go find it and give it to you in a few minutes.
