It isn&#39;t always sourced from something<br/>\nsuddenly appearing. Sometimes it&#39;s things like constant hunger.

That can be practiced<br/>\nalong with open curiosity about the world around us, as opposed to deciding<br/>\nto close off to new things for fear of thinking about them. I think<br/>\nunmindfulness is itself a source of continual stress because it blocks off<br/>\nalternatives to stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of us haven&#39;t encountered the stress of animal attacks.

Overusing<br/>\nadrenaline without the protective effect of some outlet, such as gently<br/>\nmoving one&#39;s limbs if one isn&#39;t able to vigorously scrub perfectly clean<br/>\ncountertops or walk briskly like I do when feeling annoyed, angry or<br/>\nfrustrated, can lead to adrenal exhaustion. It doesn&#39;t just effect the<br/>\nadrenals but just about all the hormones the body produces. The primary<br/>\nfunction of cortisol is to short-circuit the brain&#39;s ability to reason and<br/>\nthink so that one can focus solely on reacting as quickly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Dec 17, 2010 at 7:46 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-When I wrote my e-mail, I had just read your post and I felt as though I<br/>\n&gt; (even though it wasn&#39;t addressed to me, and I am not in a similar situation)<br/>\n&gt; had been emotionally bludgeoned.
