I tried making some targets that move-<br/>\nthings hanging in trees, etc. He still isn&#39;t happy with this. We live <br/>\nin a suburban neighborhood, so he can&#39;t just go up and down the street <br/>\nshooting at whatever he wants to. I wish he could, but we need to have <br/>\nconcern for our neighbors. I also of course have those deep seated <br/>\nfears around him wanting to shoot birds. He has always loved animals, <br/>\nand I am trying to get my head around the fact that there isn&#39;t <br/>\nanything wrong with what he is wanting to do. (Is there?!)
