All the<br/>\nlittle neighbor kids were playing outside and the Rowe clan up the street<br/>\nwere flying kites. It was really summer.<br/>\nMonday by noon it was ten degrees and blizzarding.   By four the<br/>\nInterstate was closed in a hundred and twenty mile stretch north and<br/>\nsouth of us and everyone was wondering what happened to summer.   It was<br/>\ntwo below Monday night.  <br/>\n <br/>\nToday it&#39;s beautiful again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a downy woodpecker drumming on the mountain ash tree this<br/>\nmorning.  (Haven&#39;t seen any nuthatches! )  Last night late I heard, but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t see, a flock of geese overhead.  I do hope they were going north!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goldfinches have started to arrive.  Some stayed all winter but now<br/>\nwe have a lot and the pine siskins are here too.  Two big robins in the<br/>\napple trees looking for last years leftovers are driving my cats crazy on<br/>\ntheir sunny windowsills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone seen the comet?   If it&#39;s clear tonight and tomorrow night<br/>\nlook for it near the Andromeda Galaxy on the western horizon just after<br/>\ndark.  We saw it Saturday night (you need binoculars ) and it was very<br/>\nfaint and mysterious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, from the nuthatch.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]COLD:  Nut hatches and other learning institutions","postDate":"1017855106","msgId":5979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNDAzMTczMTQ2LjYyNjMucW1haWxAd2ViMTQzMDgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzMxLjE0MzYwMy4tOTI0ODEuMi5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5965,"nextInTopic":5980,"prevInTime":5978,"nextInTime":5980,"topicId":5965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Are you and the birds doing OK in the cold snap?
