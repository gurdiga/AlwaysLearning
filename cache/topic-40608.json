Just as in the TV cookoff contest �Iron Chef,� the Iron  <br/>\nEditor must remix videos in real time in front of an audience while  <br/>\ncompeting with other editors to demonstrate superior visual literacy.  <br/>\nThe best editors can remix video as fast as you might type.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve said several times over the years is that kids who use  <br/>\ninstant messages (now more often phone texting, but I noticed it when  <br/>\nso many kids were IMing) are doing something that isn&#39;t taught or  <br/>\ndone at all in school, and that is using the written word in real  <br/>\ntime.  Speaking as someone who taught English for several years, I  <br/>\nknow the closest things are passing notes in class (disruptive and  <br/>\ndiscouraged) or short-answer tests (not really communication in a  <br/>\ndialog way).  In typewriter days, and even early online text  <br/>\ncommunication days (e-mail and bulletin boards), people had plenty of  <br/>\nchance to proofread, and they would go away and wait maybe hours or  <br/>\ndays before getting a response.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article linked here is talking about the same sort of thing,  <br/>\nusing computer editing tools and then uploading videos to YouTube,  <br/>\nwhere other people post their own versions (maybe of the same thing  <br/>\nthat poster worked with, and maybe a new variant on what was just  <br/>\nposted).   And she goes on to talk about movie editing, and the  <br/>\nfuture of the searchability of images.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the next paragraph is my commentary, not about the article  <br/>\ndirectly:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article also talks about what was valued and planned upon and  <br/>\naround before books were the big thing, and that was the spoken  <br/>\nword.  People used to listen!  After dinner, when it was too dark to  <br/>\ngo out and maybe too early to sleep, people told stories and sang  <br/>\nsongs--LONG songs.  I know many of those traditional ballads, but  <br/>\neven in the context of a medieval studies group where they have after  <br/>\ndinner times and fires and late-night campfires, they don&#39;t have the  <br/>\nskills to listen very well.  Keith and I have gone prepared with  <br/>\nlonger more serious (or funny, but still long) songs just in case  <br/>\nthere&#39;s good reception (among the people there) and also some short  <br/>\nslapstick rude humor in case they aren&#39;t able to listen.   But it&#39;s a  <br/>\nlost art in general.    The stories we know as &quot;fairy tales&quot; were  <br/>\ncalled &quot;household tales&quot; in German, and they weren&#39;t about fairies  <br/>\nmuch at all, but were stories about the old days, and fantasy places,  <br/>\nand what might&#39;ve happened in a non-specified time out in the woods  <br/>\nthere, not so far away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe timeline for change is steep and fast now, and it&#39;s another  <br/>\nreminder that we can&#39;t prepare our children for what they need to  <br/>\nknow in ten years.  We can let them explore and discover, and makes  <br/>\nsure they have access to what others are discovering, and tools to  <br/>\nplay with!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf that link cuts off you could go to<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com</a> and search for<br/>\n<br/>\nbecoming screen literate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40367,"nextTopicId":40252}}
