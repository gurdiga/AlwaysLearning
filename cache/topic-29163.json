From: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com I have more questions: What about the warning by even mainstreem pediatrics that there should be no tv for children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-738047119\">-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more questions:<br/>\nWhat about the warning by even mainstreem pediatrics that there<br/>\nshould be no tv for children under the age of two because it will<br/>\ninhibit their developement? Why wouldn&#39;t you be concerned about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should I? Do these &quot;mainstream&quot; pediatricians spend a lot of time <br/>\nwith unschooled, mindfully parented children?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have proof it doesn&#39;t. They are 19 and 11 and 46 and 45.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have ever read Naomi Aldort or listened to her CD&#39;s you know<br/>\nthat she highly recommends unschooling and yet she says no tv until<br/>\nage 9.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nANd if you want to believe what she says without question, we cannot <br/>\nstop you. But if you want to question *WHY*, we can give you our <br/>\nopinions too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that none of us are expecting you to believe anything *we* <br/>\nsay either without deeply questioning us and, more importantly, <br/>\n*YOURSELF*!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken many classes from Tom Brown at his willderness Awareness<br/>\nschool. A man named John Young who was his student for 10years taught<br/>\na class on Cayote teaching(basically unschooling by answering a<br/>\nchilds questions with another question)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of like the Socratic method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that you are believing everything these people are <br/>\nTELLING you *without* ASKING questions!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of ironic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I don&#39;t answer each and every question my kids ask <br/>\nwith a question. Very often, they simply want an answer, so I give them <br/>\nwhat they ask for.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n He showed us that tv and more<br/>\nso video games limit the mind to the point where they did studies on<br/>\nkids that played alot of video games and were only using 5% of there<br/>\nbrains.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Huh??? How is that measured?<br/>\n<br/>\nOH! You mean the &quot;researchers&quot; were only using 5% of their brains? <br/>\nGotcha! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n How exactly they test that I am not sure except that I know<br/>\nthat some kids lost the ability to see in three D and an Art teacher<br/>\nhad to take them out side and show them that this tree was actually<br/>\nfarther away then that tree.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: You *know* this? How?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet my 11 year old gamer is an artist. And completely understands <br/>\ndimensions and depth of field. How do you explain this?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me watching tv puts me in tunnel vision and takes me away from<br/>\nhearing my inner voices (messages from my spirit guides)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you didn&#39;t have TV as a child and don&#39;t have one now as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Why do you think that is? Would that be the same with <br/>\na child/adult who has always had free access to tv? What would make the <br/>\ndifference?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the power of subliminal over the tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: What about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe my mind is stronger than a box. Is yours?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it really allowing<br/>\nfor a young child to choose for themself when they are bombarded with<br/>\ncommertials that push hard for kids to get addicted to say soda etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Do you think children are so powerless and able to be <br/>\nmanipulated? Mine aren&#39;t. Why do you think yours are?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that really freedom of choice for them?.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: What? Being able to choose whether to &quot;get addicted&quot; <br/>\nto soda??? Or free access to TV?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThose advertising companies study extensively how to brainwash kids <br/>\ninto wanting there<br/>\nstuff and the government does not protect the people from very toxic<br/>\ningredients in some so called food that is directly targeted towards<br/>\nchildren.(Aspertame, propalene glysol etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Why do you think SOOOO much money is poured into <br/>\nadvertising? Don&#39;t you think that, if it WORKED, they wouldn&#39;t have to <br/>\nspend really big bucks to figure out how to brainwash kids? If it were <br/>\n*that* easy, wouldn&#39;t they find cheaper and easier ways to do it? Why <br/>\ndo you think they spend so much money every year on advertising? <br/>\nBecause it WORKS???<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think it&#39;s the GOVERNMENT&#39;S job to protect you from toxic <br/>\ningredients? Why can you protect yourself? Do you not know what&#39;s toxic <br/>\nand what&#39;s not? Why? How would you change that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about these issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: What about them?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that if you are able to<br/>\ncompletely let go of these fears even subconsiously that none of<br/>\nthese will effect you or your children?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: What do *you* think?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think I am fearful?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I believe that could be true but I am not sure how to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: How do you get over fear?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you hide from it? Would you run from it? Would you instill that <br/>\nfear into others?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr would you embrace it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all the deepest darkest fears I have about tv. I have never<br/>\nheard anything that challenged thier validity until now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Then how could you make an informed decision?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you hear many others challenging the school system before you <br/>\ndecided to pull your children out of school? *Very* few people <br/>\nchallenge the validity of school; most praise it and worship it. Give <br/>\nmoney to it (voluntarily even!)). Why did *you* buck that system and <br/>\nremove your kids from it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am all about letting go of fear and expanding my awareness..<br/>\nFirst you have to be aware of the fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Why must *I* be aware of fear?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not see myself as<br/>\nfearing tv for my children before, but now I see where the fear has<br/>\nbeen instilled in me. I did not miss tv as a child tho. My dad would<br/>\nread us esp stories around the table after dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates/Coyote: Do you fear not being able to read to your children <br/>\naround the table after dinner? Do you believe them (TV and reading) to <br/>\nbe exclusive of each other?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
