Rather than become debilitated by our devastating <br/>\nloss, the Lord gave me the hope that He would use this tragedy for <br/>\nHis glory. Immediately following Andrew&#39;s death, another son, Riley <br/>\nJosiah, became critically ill and required life support, 24 hour <br/>\nnursing, and 26 operations in 2.5 years. During this time of mourning <br/>\nour loss, caring for our sick child I was caring for a newborn and <br/>\nhomeschooling 4 other kids. The Lord taught me two invaluable <br/>\nlessons - not all loving parents are able to homeschool by themselves <br/>\nand that there was an enormous need for a homeschooling help to come <br/>\nto parents when they cannot do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo fulfill this need and God&#39;s promise that our loss would be used <br/>\nfor good, my husband and I founded The Grace Academy, an online <br/>\nschool (pending licensing) that delivers world class curriculum to <br/>\nchildren throughout the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany have called The Grace Academy the &quot;best of both world-<br/>\nhomeschooling and Christian private school.&quot; Grace provides a <br/>\ncomprehensive, world class Christian K-12 curriculum, daily Bible <br/>\nstudies, devotions, and dedicated Christian teachers - all while your <br/>\nchild(ren) learn in your safe and nurturing home..
