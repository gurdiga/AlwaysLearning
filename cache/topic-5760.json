I know what that<br/>\nfeeling is like.  Having grown up in an alcoholic family (I&#39;m not suggesting<br/>\nyou did) I find control of everything to have been a big issue for me.  I<br/>\nthink that&#39;s why unschooling has presented itself into my life.  It&#39;s given<br/>\nme a &quot;real&quot; opportunity to let go and trust that I&#39;m not in charge and that<br/>\nboth my boys are going to be ok.  I&#39;ve been really listening to people who<br/>\nhave a lot of experience and have been doing this for a while so that I can<br/>\nget centered and say to myself &quot;ok it&#39;s me that&#39;s wanting to control<br/>\neverything and I have to be the one to trust in my kids and the process&quot;....<br/>\nI hope you decide to give it a try.... However I realize it&#39;s out of my<br/>\ncontrol.....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they&#39;ve got to have stuff to integrate, first, for those days<br/>\n<br/>\nto be good<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for all the ideas Pam but I&#39;m beginning to feel that<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling is just too hard for me. I feel very overwhelmed by all<br/>\n<br/>\nthe changes that have taken place since starting homeschooling this<br/>\n<br/>\nfall. Maybe I&#39;m just not suited for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5708,"nextTopicId":5761}}
