It&#39;s a small (45 pages) book, with nice illustrations, <br/>\naimed at kids. It&#39;s starts with the beginnings of rituals and religious <br/>\nbeliefs as far back as cave men and moves through explanations of the major <br/>\nreligions. It also makes mention of lots of the minor ones. It talks about <br/>\ntheir similarities and differences. It ends with this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is no one way to seek God-no one way to look at the world.There are <br/>\ncountless paths to Enlightenment, Truth, Paradise, and Heaven, and there are <br/>\nmany ways to worship. Some people believe that their ways and ideas are the <br/>\nonly right ones. But intolerance has only led to tragedy-to religious <br/>\npersecution and violence throughout human history.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that in this world there are so many people following so many <br/>\ndifferent paths to God shows that there is no one right way. What is right <br/>\nfor one person may not be right for another. Learning about the beliefs of <br/>\nothers helps people to understand and respect one another. Appreciating <br/>\ntheir similarities and their differences helps people to learn tolerance. <br/>\nThen people can truly be neighbors, living in harmony, each group in its own <br/>\nway-living every day by the Golden Rule.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The White&#39;s","from":"&quot;The White&#39;s&quot; &lt;jwwjr@...&gt;","profile":"whitehouseacademy","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oUgL5KJ1OKQqd4iakS8nm9JIfChfZfC4dU2_F4QlwdE3s6CyHJ53kcLmcCS3AD2UnF6F58IBseRhffBc7_2eNYMJCpoBgeodyw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"spirituality","postDate":"1007299056","msgId":176,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNWUwMWMxN2IzMyRiN2RjNDgyMCQ5NzIxMWJkMEBiYjN0aDAxPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":177,"prevInTime":175,"nextInTime":177,"topicId":176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra and Pam, Thanks for sharing the info about the golden rule.
