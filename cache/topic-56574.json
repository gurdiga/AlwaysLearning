It could be you&#39;ve changed and he&#39;s  <br/>\ngetting less of your full engagement than he was before. It could be  <br/>\nhe&#39;s seeing himself in competition with his sister. (You might want to  <br/>\nread Siblings Without Rivalry to see if you recognize bits of your  <br/>\nsituation in there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my guess is that sometimes when you&#39;re with him you&#39;re not fully  <br/>\nengaged so he needs to keep pulling at you. (&quot;Whenever I did get into  <br/>\nthe games, he was SO happy,&quot; is a pretty big clue.) Or you&#39;re  <br/>\nresponding with irritation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an analogy, if he needs an hour of full engagement and you give him  <br/>\n59 minutes, he&#39;ll spend the rest of the day pulling at you to get that  <br/>\nlast minute so it will seem like he needs you 24 hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo him I&#39;m betting it feels like your full, joyful attention is a  <br/>\nlimited commodity. If you begin now, he&#39;ll ask for way more than he  <br/>\nneeds just because he fears it will disappear again. (Very common  <br/>\nreaction of any human to having free access to something that was  <br/>\nlimited.) Once he&#39;s confident he can have as much as he needs, he will  <br/>\nask for only as much as he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough what he needs may be more than you might think is usual! But  <br/>\nyou can&#39;t make him want less than he needs. By withholding what he  <br/>\nneeds you either make him needier or break his trust that you&#39;re there  <br/>\nfor him. In the second case he&#39;d ask less because he&#39;d know the answer  <br/>\nis no but you&#39;d have bought freedom from his asking at the price of  <br/>\nhis trust and his relationship with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.

Should I just  <br/>\n&gt; try my best?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like there are two things going on: he needs someone to  <br/>\nfully engage with him in his games *and* he needs you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids buckets are full and they know mom takes their needs  <br/>\nseriously, then kids understand the occasional &quot;That&#39;s not my favorite  <br/>\nthing to do,&quot; is about the thing and not about not wanting to be with  <br/>\nthem. (Though they may still ask since they want *someone* to play it  <br/>\nwith them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where friends come in. :-) When you hire babysitters are you  <br/>\nspecifically asking for kids who enjoy gaming or just kids to babysit  <br/>\nwho are given that task? I&#39;d do that as much as you can *AND* play  <br/>\nwith him -- joyfully engaged -- as much as you can *AND* engage with  <br/>\nhim outside of games as much as you can. He will eventually ask for  <br/>\nless -- though will probably still need a partner for gaming -- but it  <br/>\nmay be more than you&#39;d like but that&#39;s who he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430148316,"authorName":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","from":"&quot;whatismyusername@...&quot; &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt;","profile":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"DS4.75&#39;s neediness and how can I help?","postDate":"1280731289","msgId":56574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkzNXBhcCt0amEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56576,"prevInTime":56573,"nextInTime":56575,"topicId":56574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I didn t recognize it until today when my own neediness showed up.

He needs me to play with him a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. When he does things by himself, such as watching TV or playing &quot;solo&quot; computer game (he really likes to play 2-player games), he either wants me to sit with me or play with him<br/>\n<br/>\n3. When I am not around (going to the bathroom), he would notice and ask where I was, or started whining or crying.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.If his little sister (1.75 years old) plays with something, he would want THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. When we go out, I usually carry my DD1.75 in a baby carrier and put him in a stroller. But now he wants me to carry him on my back, which I don&#39;t really mind even if he is much heavier. (I used to carry him on my back a lot)<br/>\n<br/>\n6. When he is emotionally challenged (fussy, upset or not in the mode), he always wants me to hold him.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. He will say things like &quot;mom, hold me in your arms and walk around&quot; a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\n8. He cries when he half wakes up. He would want me to hold him. In the past, it was not a problem. DD would quietly let him get his way. But now, DD1.75 would want me to hold her or sit on my lap. They would both fight for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Sometimes he only wants me to bring him water, feed him or massage him. Not let anyone else do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has been always needy, but seems more so now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe really likes to play computer games and he likes ME to play with him. To be honest, I am just tired of playing the same game over and over again. I try my best to play with him. But he can play for 12 hours non-stop. Even when he is tired, he still wants to play. I cannot keep up with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell he really craves someone to play with him, preferably the playmate will enjoy what he likes too. For example, my nephew, who is 25, likes to play computer game. My son just LOVES him and wants him to visit so much (but he works long hours).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my questions are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Why is he so needy? Is it his personality? Is it because I didn&#39;t meet his needs?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How can I help him?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. What can I do if I don&#39;t enjoy doing what he likes? Should I just try my best?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I hired some babysitters to play with him. I tried to play with him too but didn&#39;t last long. Whenever I did get into the games, he was SO happy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI found my response to his neediness was not very good one. I found I tended to pull away once I felt pulled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input and suggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\nJihong (Joy), mother of DS4.75 and DD1.75<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
