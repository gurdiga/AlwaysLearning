Didn&#39;t find it.   <br/>\nFound this list of post cards and envelopes for sale (or formerly for  <br/>\nsale).  I didn&#39;t want to buy any, but searching around it and kind of  <br/>\nrandomly looking at images, I learned a lot about World War II  <br/>\neveryday life realities I hadn&#39;t ever heard about or considered, and  <br/>\nthere were things not at all related to that, either, and things from  <br/>\nearlier in the 20th century.  The envelope of some confidential U.N.  <br/>\nbusiness from someone in the Congo to someone in India.  A Christmas  <br/>\ncard created for U.S. military personnel in Europe.  Mail from a  <br/>\nGerman concentration camp.  Mail to a German soldier who was a  <br/>\nprisoner of war in New York state.  The scans are really good, the  <br/>\nstamps and post marks and addresses and the art on the envelopes and  <br/>\nsuch are really interesting.  Jewish-specific cards to announce that  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s returned safely (from a battle, I was guessing--search the  <br/>\n#3 list for &quot;Judaica&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you change the 3 to a 2 or 1 in the URL you get different lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mayoph.com/prevlist_2.htm\">http://www.mayoph.com/prevlist_2.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mayoph.com/prevlist_1.htm\">http://www.mayoph.com/prevlist_1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28779,"nextTopicId":28782}}
