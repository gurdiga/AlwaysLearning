I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-487664258\">Hi all. I just got back to the Land-o-the-Olympics and I&#39;m back online! :o) <br/>\nHope I didn&#39;t miss anything too interesting. I hate scrolling through <br/>\narchives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky enough to meet a couple of terrific unschoolers while I was in <br/>\nFlorida. My first IRL visit with online friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur hostess was Angela Nordstrom who posts over at the unschooling.com <br/>\nmessage boards. Great fun was had by all and Casey has yet another penpal <br/>\nand new friend, Abby. (How many penpals can one kid have?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got to hang out with Sharon of the Swamp, who drove hours to  get <br/>\nthere! She and her son, Roy, even brought rabbits for the hostess (live ones <br/>\nfor pets), and Conor and Roy got to commiserate over older folks who think <br/>\ntheir long hair and ponytails means that they are girls. Grrrr. They also <br/>\ngot to shoot BB guns and a compound bow and arrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could meet all of you in IRL. Maybe that should be my goal for the <br/>\nupcoming years. I&#39;ve just never had a gathering where everything went so <br/>\nsmoothly and felt so together and at ease from moment one. I love <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5153,"nextTopicId":5151}}
