I&#39;ve seen her get along <br/>\ntremendously with some kids and not others, then go for months not <br/>\nhaving any social contact with other kids her own age, and suddenly <br/>\ngets along better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time.  Some kids are more empathic of others, some aren&#39;t, <br/>\neven older kids.  My youngest is 6, and is just now starting to feel <br/>\nempathic of others.  It wouldn&#39;t have occured to her to feel badly <br/>\nabout something that she did to another person, even if you told her <br/>\nor explained why it was wrong.  It was better to say &quot;play nicely&quot;, <br/>\nor &quot;don&#39;t do.....&quot;, anything else was going to go in one ear and out <br/>\nthe other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, we&#39;ve tried to play with other kids that are a <br/>\nlittle more &quot;thick skinned&quot;.  I don&#39;t like to play referee.  I do try <br/>\nto stay in the moment, though, so that I&#39;m not just putting out <br/>\nfires, I&#39;m keeping the fires from starting in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older daughter never had these kind of issues.  She was kind of <br/>\nopposite, the one who never got her turn because she patiently <br/>\nwaited.  She was quiet and shy and VERY empathic of others, her sense <br/>\nof fairness eventually made her the most popular kid to play with in <br/>\nthe neighborhood.  That and the fact that she had all the good <br/>\nideas!  I saw other kids going to Chamille to settle disagreements <br/>\nbecause they knew she was fair.  That was such an amazing and <br/>\npowerful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so much about personality.  Unschooling works so wonderfully <br/>\nbecause each person is able to use their strengths to their greatest <br/>\nadvantage and not worry so much on the things they aren&#39;t as good at, <br/>\nknowing that it will happen in its own way and time.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teacher/Friend&#39;s comments about DD (8) not yet reading o...","postDate":"1193331474","msgId":31155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCRjJCMjY4LTg1NUYtNDdGNS05MjE5LTdGMERGMDIzOEU3OEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmcWJhcitrdm5sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZmcWJhcitrdm5sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31154,"nextInTopic":31158,"prevInTime":31154,"nextInTime":31156,"topicId":31134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am still having difficulty understanding the balance of letting the children ( in my case 2-4 years ols usually) work it out themselves, acknowledge the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-992735104\">-=-I am still having difficulty understanding the balance of letting the<br/>\nchildren ( in my case 2-4 years ols usually) work it out themselves,  <br/>\nacknowledge the child<br/>\nwith the so called behavior while supporting the child who was  <br/>\nperhaps hurt, physically or<br/>\nemotionally.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think &quot;work it out yourself&quot; is a good thing for kids.

It helped her feel comfortable about the reading, as well as<br/>\nfeeling a little less shy having never met most of the guests. At the<br/>\nparty, I snuggled in next to her, sat back, and when it was her turn<br/>\nto read &quot;clues&quot; I just read for her - no big deal.  She didn&#39;t mind<br/>\nand the other guests (and the teacher/mom) adjusted quickly to me<br/>\nbeing there and didn&#39;t make my daughter feel less comfortable for<br/>\nbringing me along.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  4.

Your  DD sounds like a <br/>\nhappy, healthy little girl who is loved and encouraged enough  at home that she <br/>\nfeels free to follow her passions.  My advice is to talk  with your daughter <br/>\nabout this.  8 years old is not too young to understand  that some people feel <br/>\nthat there is only one way to do things (usually the way  that they are doing <br/>\nthem) and that while they are trying to be helpful, their  actions and <br/>\ncomments can sometimes cause hurt feelings and frustration.   Let her know that <br/>\nwhile some aspects of the class may be really fun and  interesting, there may be <br/>\naspects that are difficult for her.  Let her know  that the teacher may (and <br/>\nprobably will) expect things from her that she just  isn&#39;t able to do right now. <br/>\n I&#39;d tell her that she can continue in the  class and enjoy the fun stuff and <br/>\ntry not to get frustrated by the other stuff,  or the two of you can find <br/>\nways of incorporating some of the fun service  projects into your family life.  <br/>\nIf she decides to continue, I would  absolutely pull your &quot;friend&quot; aside and <br/>\ntell her about your talk with your DD  and that, despite not enjoying the <br/>\ntextbook activities and such, DD has made the  decision to stick with the class in <br/>\norder to participate in the service  projects, etc.  Let her know you are <br/>\nsupporting DD&#39;s decision and that you  expect your friend to be considerate and <br/>\nrespectful of your DD.  Tell her  that if she has a problem, she should discuss <br/>\nit with you.  Under no  circumstances should she try to shame or embarrass your <br/>\ndaughter.  If your  friend has a problem with your daughter not being &quot;on <br/>\nlevel&quot; with the other  children, then maybe the class isn&#39;t a good fit.  She has <br/>\nset the class up  in a certain way and may not be willing to compromise for <br/>\none child.   Hopefully, she will be able to overlook the imagined &quot;holes&quot; in <br/>\nyour DD&#39;s  education and keep her opinions to herself so that your DD can enjoy  <br/>\nherself.  Just my humble (yet rather long. LOL) opinion.
