I could not leave her home cause she did not separate for more than an hour or so and was still nursing a lot ( still is). So I stayed home. As much as I wanted to go it would have been a nightmare for her and me in the car. My husband was super busy that day to come with us and help on the road. <br/>\nWhen my son could not cope with going to visit people&#39;s homes at 2 years old ( he wanted to touch things and jump on furniture) I did not go. Now at 6 he is super polite on other peoples homes and understands that he can jump on our couch ( a $20 couch from goodwill) but not on others. He takes his shoes of when he visits people in the entrance, He is great but at 2 it was too much for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Gravel, rock and mulch play","postDate":"1223423892","msgId":39202,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBRjgyMTE0LTJGM0QtNEIxRi04RDgyLUE2NEIwREQ1RUVGQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjZ3JhMisxMjI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdjZ3JhMisxMjI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39197,"nextInTopic":39216,"prevInTime":39201,"nextInTime":39203,"topicId":39129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But I m also wondering if it s okay to sometimes just wait to expose her to certain kind of situations when I know we have trouble, like until next year","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-992451919\">-=-But I&#39;m also wondering if it&#39;s okay to sometimes just wait to expose<br/>\nher to certain kind of situations when I know we have trouble, like<br/>\nuntil next year when she&#39;s bigger and understands things better, for<br/>\nexample.

Probably not from just letting it fall <br/>\nthrough her fingers though - depending on how loud it became (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\nGravel costs money. If it were meant for the path, then someone else would <br/>\nend up having to gather any that was off the path and return it, so throwing <br/>\ntowards the fence might be problematic in that way (not really having a <br/>\nvision in my mind of the whole landscape). Stepping onto grass and finding <br/>\nsharp bits of gravel hiding in it is never pleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this particular case, any that ended up by accident in the wrong animal&#39;s <br/>\nenclosure could be problem for the critter too for all we know. Also with <br/>\nnervous and sick wild animals, the noise of the gravel hitting the fence or <br/>\nground could be alarming and harmful to their health.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I have said to Jayn is that I&#39;d rather she not do whatever it <br/>\nwas because some one from the place would be likely to become alarmed and <br/>\ncome up and be stern with her about it. I would say that I could see that <br/>\nshe was doing no harm, but other people might not be able to do so, and that <br/>\nthey might become worried. I sometimes phrase it as a thing that a lot of <br/>\nadults are made nervous by kids who appear to be out of control even when <br/>\nthey really aren&#39;t. I have also used the phrase, &quot;This isn&#39;t the right place <br/>\nfor this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think more appropriate places and safe throwing games might be in order. <br/>\nSometimes the urge to throw is very strong. At the Space Center Houston they <br/>\nhave a really cool throwing game inside an enclosure with quite heavy (so <br/>\nthey will arc in the air) but still soft dense foam balls and a number of <br/>\nspace targets. The kids get to throw the balls by hand in one part, and use <br/>\nair powered (I think I am remembering right) guns to shoot them at the space <br/>\nstuff in another. It was hugely popular and constantly full the whole time <br/>\nwe were there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Now I just remind him that most people don&#39;t like gravel<br/>\nthrown at them and that people like to walk on it so throwing at the path is<br/>\ncool. We take turns seeing how much gravel we can displace when we aim at<br/>\nthe path. When that game is over, we make a game of kicking the gravel into<br/>\nthe holes we&#39;ve made.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I still feel a little uncomfortable when other adults are around<br/>\nbecause I feel like they disapprove of this. I try to remind myself that<br/>\nthis my issue and that if we leave te path the way we found it, there&#39;s no<br/>\nharm in playing. If there are too many people and we&#39;re blockign the path, I<br/>\nask him if we can wait until the people have passed. This usually works just<br/>\nfine. Often, it leads us to other fun games &quot;else place&quot; as Ryan calls it.<br/>\n*grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nJean Elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3mommies.blogpsot.com\">http://3mommies.blogpsot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Oct 5, 2008 at 8:41 PM, Karen Hsu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcbhsu@...\">kcbhsu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   My almost 5 year old son likes to play with mulch, gravel and rocks.
