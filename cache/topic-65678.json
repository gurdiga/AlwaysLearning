If the original poster&#39;s daughter had reluctantly walked over the gravel, there would have been nothing real or natural about it because an adult was standing right there, capable of helping. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn stories with child protagonists, the first thing writers do is separate them from their parents (often by orphaning them) so that they MUST figure things out themselves. Home Alone, Finding Nemo, My Neighbor Totoro, Snow White, David Copperfield, the Pevensie children, Harry Potter, Hugo, Heidi, The Rescuers, Coraline, and on and on -- these all feature children with no choice but to solve their own problems, who have no kind or loving adults to turn to. If an adult is present and will not help, they become part of the problem, like the Dursleys or the parents in &#39;Mathilda&#39;. On a gut level, readers and audiences (i.e., people) understand that letting a child founder is harsh. Our kids know it&#39;s harsh when we do it to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a world of difference between finding yourself in dire circumstances and being placed or left in dire circumstances by someone you love or depend on.

These are typically euphemisms for a form of<br/>\npunishment - a way to &quot;negatively reinforce&quot; certain behaviors. This is the<br/>\nflip side of reward training. If a child leaves a toy outdoors and it<br/>\nbegins to rain, the parent may call it a natural or logical consequence to<br/>\nleave the toy outdoors to be ruined. I call it mean and that is exactly<br/>\nwhat the child will think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an alternative? Yes. Relationship-based parenting is living in a<br/>\nhousehold with each person giving and getting what they need, including<br/>\nsupport and encouragement and information. Parents take responsibility for<br/>\nbeing kind and generous with their children while their  their children are<br/>\ngrowing into kind and responsible people, themselves. The parents do this<br/>\nby BEING kind and generous and responsible with their children.

Have you ever made a choice that wasn&#39;t well thought out?  When that happened, did your partner help you figure things out or tell you to deal with it on your own? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----That just seems like alot of work to save her from three or four steps on a gravel driveway. ----<br/>\n<br/>\nThrowing an a pair of shoes in your bag is a lot of &quot;extra work&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, it seems like far less work than calming down a crying child. All the little ways you offer support now, instead of  coming from a place of godawful sentiments like, &quot;I told you so,&quot;  &quot;suck it up,&quot;  &quot;you made your bed, now lie in it,&quot; will, in the future--tomorrow, even--add strength to your relationship.  Your daughter will know that her mom is on her side, is her *partner*, instead of feeling like she&#39;s got to deal with things on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----If these situations happened often and I continued to &quot;let it go&quot; and not allow her to see natural consequences for her decisions, what kind of message does this send? ------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sends the message that mom is looking out for her! That mom can be trusted and counted on. That mom will help find solutions when she&#39;s in a bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the last decision she&#39;ll make without thinking it through the end, clearly.  If you want her to trust you later, when the consequences are more dire, support her, rather than try to teach her a lesson, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t force someone to mature quicker than she&#39;s able to.  One day fairly soon, she&#39;ll be able to think further ahead, and even then, it is Always a good idea to have extra clothes, jackets and shoes in your car!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Rescuing children from natural consequences","postDate":"1329617572","msgId":65690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGODNBRDAyLTI4NkItNDVGQS05RTMzLTFERDM1MTk5MUI4OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpocGs1bCtmNXIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpocGs1bCtmNXIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65689,"nextInTopic":65691,"prevInTime":65689,"nextInTime":65691,"topicId":65678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I see what you are saying, but -=- Yeah, but.
