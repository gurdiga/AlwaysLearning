When there&#39;s no one available on Skype to talk to while he<br/>\nplays WoW with them, for example. I can offer to sit with him (generally<br/>\nwith food in my hands, peanut butter or chicken works well here) and watch<br/>\n(he loves to fill me in on the game), cheer him on; or we can play a board<br/>\ngame; or we can ride bikes... I don&#39;t think he needs to get off the<br/>\ncomputer, though some of the things I offer are not computer related. Mostly<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s been doing any one thing for a long time, I miss him. He&#39;s not<br/>\nbeen playing too long, I&#39;ve been away too long. Yesterday I struck a cool<br/>\nbalance between hovering and absence. I heard friends sign off, I made up a<br/>\nplate, I hung out & we chatted, then I excused myself when a friend came<br/>\nback. win/win/win.<br/>\nIf a child wants to hear options, of course playing the piano would be on<br/>\nthe list - it&#39;s an option. When Hannah didn&#39;t tinkle on the piano for a few<br/>\ndays, I might mention it because I noticed and I missed it. She&#39;d still play<br/>\nwhen *she* felt like it; it was nice for her to be reminded it was a<br/>\npleasant part of our life too, without obligation to play.<br/>\nWhen I see that Hayden has a big pile of freezie-pop wrappers in front of<br/>\nhim and he&#39;s reaching for 5 more, I might mention I&#39;d be happy to make him<br/>\nsome food, did he know I just got more of his favorite X? - not a judgment,<br/>\nreading the signs that he&#39;s hungry and is reaching for what&#39;s easy - he does<br/>\nappreciate the offer and often takes me up on something more substantial. I<br/>\nhave to remember to have the substantial things easily accessible, too.<br/>\nHayden&#39;s been cooking his own eggs for months (he&#39;s moved up from scrambled<br/>\n(wet or dry?) and is perfecting his over-easy) and has just added Ramen and<br/>\nGrillers to his repertoire. Sometimes easy sweets is just what he needs.<br/>\n(me, too! I requested and received popcorn and chocolate to perfect my<br/>\nevening, last night!!)<br/>\nHe&#39;s been showering a lot lately. At least twice a week since we&#39;ve moved<br/>\n(up from semi-monthly). And brushing his teeth. He&#39;s asked me to remind him<br/>\ndaily. So I do. Sometimes he goes and brushes right then and sometimes he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. He showered and brushed and put on new clothes for the Bowling for<br/>\nSoup concert last weekend. I merely had the supplies ready.<br/>\nI go to bed before he does. I make a sleeping spot for him and set up his<br/>\ncomforts before I turn in. I make sure he&#39;s fed and watered and well-loved.<br/>\nHe&#39;s asked me to curl up with him and I do. At some point I get crowded and<br/>\nmove to my own, larger, bed. He&#39;s even come to bed with me and the DVD<br/>\nplayer. Having different schedules doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have a *bedtime*<br/>\nroutine, or two or three ;) We also use this time to talk about the upcoming<br/>\ndays and what the time schedule is like. He&#39;ll often curl up in my bed if he<br/>\nwants me to wake him up when I get up, before 10. He&#39;ll take the sofabed if<br/>\nhe&#39;s up late and wants to sleep in. I&#39;ll remind him, when he has asked, to<br/>\n*begin cool down* earlier so he can get sleep for the next day. Sleep is<br/>\nimportant, you should talk about it.

Margaux is <br/>\nstill not really able to cue herself in to the fact that she is <br/>\ngetting tired, and we, the parents, keep missing Margaux&#39;s cues, as <br/>\nshe tends to go from happy high energy, to crash in 5 seconds.
