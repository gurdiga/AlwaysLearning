She is an<br/>\nincredible woman & a fun mom.  She had not heard of unschooling before the<br/>\ninvite & wished she had, definitely the spirit of an unschooler in her.<br/>\nHer boys only had 2 rules growing up: don&#39;t kill each other & don&#39;t break my<br/>\nstuff. I think a weekend with the principles vs rules questioning was<br/>\nlife-changing for her, too ;)<br/>\nI&#39;m going to revisit her stuff,  it&#39;s been a long time :)<br/>\nHers is a beneficial voice to add to your internal choir!<br/>\n~diana<br/>\nhannahbearski.wordpress.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 13, 2010 9:34 PM, &quot;k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katherand@...\">katherand@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not be for you but perhaps try the concepts (which aren&#39;t at all<br/>\ndeep) in Refuse to Choose by Barbara Sher. I have struggled to be better at<br/>\norganizing and planning and the actual doing of my plans. A couple of the<br/>\nideas just aren&#39;t me, and don&#39;t fit, but Sher&#39;s suggestions are working for<br/>\nme. I&#39;ve always been the kind of person that things happen to without much<br/>\nplanning and just the idea of how to do it has been pretty foreign in the<br/>\npast. But I&#39;m taking to the ideas in Sher&#39;s book like a duck to water. Not<br/>\nhard for me. It might be something to check out of the library tho I got my<br/>\ncopy cheap from Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, Feb 13, 2010 at 4:46 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:whatismyusername@...\">whatismyusername@...</a> &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:whatismyusername@...\">whatismyusername@...</a>&gt; wrote: ...<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
