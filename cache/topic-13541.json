I know exactly why, and I&#39;m not <br/>\n  knowing a good way to just get over it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Help?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s so far, and it&#39;s a wimpy nothing story and I&#39;m telling it with <br/>\n  apologies in advance.  It will probably seem stupid to most of you, but I&#39;ve <br/>\n  nearly puked and felt like crying.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is long and a bit gross, and medicalish, which will attract some of you <br/>\n  and not interest others.  Feel very free to pass it on by.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Keith came and showed me a puncture wound and blood smear on his lower right <br/>\n  leg (calf kinda 1/3 way from the knee and at 2:00 if the shin is noon) and <br/>\n  said &quot;I can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s anything in here.  I was picking up dog shit, <br/>\n  and felt something and thought maybe it was a bee, and I slapped at it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I poked at it and there was DEFINITELY something in there, almost an inch <br/>\n  long, and not teensy.  A stick, it seemed.  And not near the hole.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Had this been where Keith could see it well and get to it with his own left <br/>\n  hand, it would&#39;ve been no problem, but it was in an awkard place for a lefty <br/>\n  with a recently very bad right eye to do much about.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I could pinch either end of this thing and tell it was not really near the <br/>\n  surface on either side.  Keith got a needle and tweezers which was going to <br/>\n  do no good whatsoever.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to call our friend Steve who used to be an army medic in Viet Nam <br/>\n  and would think nothing of cutting Keith and putting in a stitch in our back <br/>\n  yard.  I wanted to take Keith to the clinic and pay $40 co-pay for them to <br/>\n  fix it.  No, he said, just take it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never been attracted to medical stuff.  I&#39;ve taken first aid courses, <br/>\n  girl scouts, red cross, school, brush up when I had a baby.  And I&#39;m find <br/>\n  with a kid emergency, and I can wrap bandages and although I don&#39;t like it, I <br/>\n  CAN do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But one thing I&#39;ve never truly become comfortable with is what exactly is <br/>\n  inside people exactly where.  But I could tell this needed to be cut.  And <br/>\n  though we have in the past had disposable scalpels in the house, we didn&#39;t <br/>\n  yesterday.  I asked for a new Xacto blade, and just the thought made me <br/>\n  really glad I hadn&#39;t had breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I ended up cutting Keith&#39;s leg three times.  Keith has a very high pain <br/>\n  threshhold.  If someone had cut my leg I&#39;d&#39;ve been screaming and yelling.  <br/>\n  Keith was very still and said &quot;go ahead, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have never cut human skin before, not counting my own accidently and really <br/>\n  fast.  But to look and think and consciously do it, I never had.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\n  like a formaldehyde frog, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I cut too shallow.  And I wanted to quit.  And Keith was being pretty <br/>\n  patient, knowing how I am.  He said maybe he should just wake Martin up (he <br/>\n  always calls Marty &quot;Martin&quot;) and get him to do it.  I figured I was better <br/>\n  than a groggy Marty, so I tried again.  And it took another cut on the other <br/>\n  side.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I was sticking fingernails into Keith-flesh to find the end of this damned <br/>\n  stick.  Finally I got it out with tweezers, and it was 3/4 inch long, a piece <br/>\n  of lumber.  Very sharp.  Fat, flat other end.  I thought it was a big thorn <br/>\n  at first until I washed it and saw woodgrain.  Room for growth rings to show. <br/>\n  YUCK.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I was shocked at how strong skin is and how hard it was to cut it.  So <br/>\n  with this new knowledge I keep having memories of that and thoughts of other <br/>\n  wounds I&#39;ve had and seen and how much force it took.

Is there a category for those who are fascinated, rather than repulsed, by medical stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom was a nurse by career, and it also seems to be a part of her personality.  I can handle minor things, but seeing inside bodies makes me very weak and queasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe gave us our injections when we were kids.  (Although I&#39;m sure this was to save money, not because she really preferred to do it herself.  I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is the best person to take care of you when you are sick.  She does things like fluff and turn your pillow to the cool side before you even think of needing it yourself.  When things happened, such as the time my brother got a huge piece of bark stuck inside his leg, or my other brother burned his hand, or the time I hit my head and had an immediate goose egg-sized bump, she acted calmly, applied the proper first aid, and did what needed to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe nursed my step-dad through chemotherapy and dying at home, including a final bath after he died but before we called the funeral parlor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow she was trained as a nurse is very interesting to me.  Nurses training in the 50&#39;s consisted of a three year residential program affiliated with a hospital.  From day one, they were actually DOING nursing, rather that spending two or three years in a classroom, THEN going into the hospital.  They had classes at the same time they did the apprenticeship/internship part.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe now has severe rheumatoid arthritis and gives herself twice weekly injections, besides managing an arseol of medication.  She has tried, in vain, to teach me how to give her injections.  I just don&#39;t want to.  My kids have watched her do the injections, and Lisa did push the plunger once, after Mom inserted the needle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a useful tip, for those who don&#39;t know it.  When you receive an injection, if you relax your muscles, the nedle will go in much easier.  If the muscles are tense, they resist the needle.  This is true for needles for blood draws too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning something new I did NOT want to learn at all, ever","postDate":"1050329120","msgId":13550,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNDE0LjA4MDUyMC4xNjguMTAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13549,"nextInTopic":13558,"prevInTime":13549,"nextInTime":13551,"topicId":13541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it s good someone without a medical background or interest feels queasy about such things.

I&#39;ve taken first aid courses, <br/>\n&gt;girl scouts, red cross, school, brush up when I had a baby.  And I&#39;m find <br/>\n&gt;with a kid emergency, and I can wrap bandages and although I don&#39;t like it, I <br/>\n&gt;CAN do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But one thing I&#39;ve never truly become comfortable with is what exactly is <br/>\n&gt;inside people exactly where.  But I could tell this needed to be cut.  And <br/>\n&gt;though we have in the past had disposable scalpels in the house, we didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;yesterday.  I asked for a new Xacto blade, and just the thought made me <br/>\n&gt;really glad I hadn&#39;t had breakfast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I ended up cutting Keith&#39;s leg three times.  Keith has a very high pain <br/>\n&gt;threshhold.  If someone had cut my leg I&#39;d&#39;ve been screaming and yelling.  <br/>\n&gt;Keith was very still and said &quot;go ahead, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have never cut human skin before, not counting my own accidently and really <br/>\n&gt;fast.  But to look and think and consciously do it, I never had.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;like a formaldehyde frog, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I cut too shallow.  And I wanted to quit.  And Keith was being pretty <br/>\n&gt;patient, knowing how I am.  He said maybe he should just wake Martin up (he <br/>\n&gt;always calls Marty &quot;Martin&quot;) and get him to do it.  I figured I was better <br/>\n&gt;than a groggy Marty, so I tried again.  And it took another cut on the other <br/>\n&gt;side.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was sticking fingernails into Keith-flesh to find the end of this damned <br/>\n&gt;stick.  Finally I got it out with tweezers, and it was 3/4 inch long, a piece <br/>\n&gt;of lumber.  Very sharp.  Fat, flat other end.  I thought it was a big thorn <br/>\n&gt;at first until I washed it and saw woodgrain.  Room for growth rings to show. <br/>\n&gt; YUCK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I was shocked at how strong skin is and how hard it was to cut it.  So <br/>\n&gt;with this new knowledge I keep having memories of that and thoughts of other <br/>\n&gt;wounds I&#39;ve had and seen and how much force it took.

I wanted to take Keith to the clinic and pay $40 co-pay for them to <br/>\nfix it.  No, he said, just take it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never been attracted to medical stuff.  I&#39;ve taken first aid courses, <br/>\ngirl scouts, red cross, school, brush up when I had a baby.  And I&#39;m find <br/>\nwith a kid emergency, and I can wrap bandages and although I don&#39;t like it, I <br/>\nCAN do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing I&#39;ve never truly become comfortable with is what exactly is <br/>\ninside people exactly where.  But I could tell this needed to be cut.  And <br/>\nthough we have in the past had disposable scalpels in the house, we didn&#39;t <br/>\nyesterday.  I asked for a new Xacto blade, and just the thought made me <br/>\nreally glad I hadn&#39;t had breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up cutting Keith&#39;s leg three times.  Keith has a very high pain <br/>\nthreshhold.  If someone had cut my leg I&#39;d&#39;ve been screaming and yelling.  <br/>\nKeith was very still and said &quot;go ahead, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never cut human skin before, not counting my own accidently and really <br/>\nfast.  But to look and think and consciously do it, I never had.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlike a formaldehyde frog, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cut too shallow.  And I wanted to quit.  And Keith was being pretty <br/>\npatient, knowing how I am.  He said maybe he should just wake Martin up (he <br/>\nalways calls Marty &quot;Martin&quot;) and get him to do it.  I figured I was better <br/>\nthan a groggy Marty, so I tried again.  And it took another cut on the other <br/>\nside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was sticking fingernails into Keith-flesh to find the end of this damned <br/>\nstick.  Finally I got it out with tweezers, and it was 3/4 inch long, a piece <br/>\nof lumber.  Very sharp.  Fat, flat other end.  I thought it was a big thorn <br/>\nat first until I washed it and saw woodgrain.  Room for growth rings to show. <br/>\n YUCK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was shocked at how strong skin is and how hard it was to cut it.  So <br/>\nwith this new knowledge I keep having memories of that and thoughts of other <br/>\nwounds I&#39;ve had and seen and how much force it took.  It&#39;s just a piece of <br/>\nnew information, and kind of a new piece, and one I would have been happy to <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are things people don&#39;t want to learn, and I feel awful <br/>\nwhimpering about this when all my children are alive and healthy, that my <br/>\nhusband had a fat splinter.  It&#39;s not about that, it&#39;s about the physical <br/>\n&quot;news&quot; of the situation and how it affected me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not even sure what the point is.  Just I quickly feel like puking every <br/>\nfew hours this weekend, remembering that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could have typed it away or sung it away, or sewn it a little cap, that <br/>\nsplinter would have been SO merrily out of there!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to those of you who ARE medically inclined and courageous and <br/>\nknowledgeable, I&#39;m more impressed than before and grateful there are some <br/>\npeople who can and will do those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith was glad and sympathetic to my discomfort, and we washed, <br/>\nanti-bioticked and band-aided it, and though it&#39;s a little infected right at <br/>\nthe opening, just barely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith never even winced.  He is so strong and so brave and I&#39;m such a total <br/>\ncrybaby wimp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13595,"nextTopicId":13318}}
