We want you to <br/>\n&gt; PLAY----just like in &quot;old-time kindergarten&quot;. We need for you to <br/>\nunderstand that PLAYING <br/>\n&gt; is LEARNING. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is the first &quot;rule&quot; of unschooling. PLAY!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second rule. Everything counts. Everything you learn----on purpose <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; accidentally----counts. You WILL eventually make a connection with <br/>\nthat tiny bit of <br/>\n&gt; information you discovered yesterday. Give it time. Connect the <br/>\ndots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Third Rule. You will only remember what is important to Y-O-U! And <br/>\nthat can <br/>\n&gt; change over time. The best way to learn things is through <br/>\nimmersion IN those <br/>\n&gt; things. Passions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rule four. ALL things are connected. ALL THINGS! You know <br/>\nthe &quot;Seven Degrees <br/>\n&gt; of Separation of Kevin Bacon? I promise that there are fewer than <br/>\nseven <br/>\n&gt; degrees between all things in the universe. Try us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rule five. There is NO division in UNschooling. Now before pam <br/>\n(little p) <br/>\n&gt; chimes in with 6/3, let me clarify. We do NOT divide the world <br/>\ninto &quot;subjects&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; Math is art is science is history is music is literature. It&#39;s all <br/>\nrelated and <br/>\n&gt; inter-related. YOUR school makes these divisions; The Church of <br/>\nJohn Holt <br/>\n&gt; School does not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rule six. Well-roundedness is over-rated. At the same time, by <br/>\nimmersing <br/>\n&gt; yourself into a passion, you automatically cover all <br/>\nthe &quot;badschool subjects&quot;. You <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t help it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rule seven. Ban Book Worship! You need to see all methods of <br/>\ngetting <br/>\n&gt; knowledge into the brain as equal. Books may take a back-seat in a <br/>\nchild&#39;s learning <br/>\n&gt; for a while. That&#39;s OK. There are MANY ways to obtain information: <br/>\nTV, games, <br/>\n&gt; eating out/eating IN, movies, vacations, talking,----yeah! just <br/>\nplain old <br/>\n&gt; enagaging each other in conversation! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rule eight. The only times we cannot learn are 1) when we are in a <br/>\ncoma (and <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know that for sure). 2) when we are frightened. Learning <br/>\nstops when we <br/>\n&gt; are scared. and 3) when we are forced. Coersion is not conducive <br/>\nto true <br/>\n&gt; learning. Regurgitation, maybe. Learning, NO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there are some more &quot;school rules&quot; that some of our <br/>\nother &quot;teachers&quot; <br/>\n&gt; can add, but....I&#39;m on a rollllll....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; AFTER you ban the school-think and school-speak from your mind, <br/>\nTHEN you can <br/>\n&gt; slowly start adding it in. But as unschooling &quot;teachers&quot;, our <br/>\nfirst lesson is <br/>\n&gt; to get you to leave those words and acts behind. We *have to* get <br/>\nyou to see <br/>\n&gt; that you are surrounded by opportunities to learn. You can&#39;t <br/>\nescape it. You&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; hard-wired to learn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DEschooling is the healing process that takes place after school---<br/>\n-for YOU <br/>\n&gt; and the child. You can&#39;t rush it any more than you can rush a <br/>\nbroken leg to <br/>\n&gt; heal. You *can* do things to relieve that pain though. Offer to <br/>\nread to him. Take <br/>\n&gt; him out to the new Korean restaurant. Most importantly, stay away <br/>\nfrom <br/>\n&gt; &quot;classes and lessons&quot; until he&#39;s ready to accept them as &quot;just <br/>\nanother option&quot;. Our <br/>\n&gt; culture puts too much emphasis on classes and lessons and teachers <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; requirements and such. You&#39;ll need to keep that at arm&#39;s length <br/>\nfor a while until you <br/>\n&gt; are comfortable with the idea that you CAN learn without them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn&#39;t part of it having the choice to choose what you want <br/>\nto learn <br/>\n&gt; and how you learn it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once you&#39;re comfortable with the idea that classes aren&#39;t the be-<br/>\nall-end-all, <br/>\n&gt; then you can offer some kind of specialty class---like karate or <br/>\nriding <br/>\n&gt; lessons or piano (Consider that John Holt High School).  AFTER you <br/>\nknow in your <br/>\n&gt; heart of hearts that ALL learning is equal, that ALL learning can <br/>\nbe obtained <br/>\n&gt; from *living*, THEN classes may eke into your unschooling life <br/>\n(College of John <br/>\n&gt; Holt).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK.
