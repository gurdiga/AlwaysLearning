I asked if they wanted to draw on the walkway and told them that since it had just gotten done raining, the colors would be really pretty because the sidewalk was still wet. They all went to draw, and this led to my daughter coming up with a neat idea. She put 2 and 2 together and decided that the combination of water and chalk could make paint. So for the last 2 days, she and my 5-yr.-old have been out back crushing sidewalk chalk with a spoon, adding water, and putting the &quot;paint&quot; in empty fingerpaint containers. My younger daughter has been having a blast getting messy with her big sister and mixing colors to see what she gets. It&#39;s really nice because you can use it on paper and, since it&#39;s just chalk, on the sidewalk, too. I just thought I&#39;d let you all in on her idea because it&#39;s a really inexpensive alternative to buying paint, and it can be fun for the kids if they&#39;d like to try it, too. Have a great day!</span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0.1em;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.1em;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;display:block;\"><span><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0.1em;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.1em;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;display:block;\"><span>Shelly</span></p></span><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1594059288yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75992,"nextTopicId":76025}}
