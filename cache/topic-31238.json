He wouldn&#39;t want to stay at all if there was<br/>\nany kid he didn&#39;t know there. The same happened when we went to a<br/>\nstore,he would freak out if someone looked at him. My husband was very<br/>\nconcerned,he said it really bothered him,Lukas might need preschool or<br/>\nsomething...blah blah. I reassured him that it will change. We didn&#39;t<br/>\ndo anything except honor Lukas&#39; feelings. We did not force or talk him<br/>\ninto any social situations he didn&#39;t want to be in. He did change. He<br/>\nis so social now that my husband said one day that he is starved for<br/>\nsocial scenes. Speaking of trick or treating last night....it was<br/>\nLukas&#39; first time(he wasn&#39;t into costumes before) He rang the<br/>\nbells,talked to people and had a great time. My sciatica didn&#39;t bother<br/>\nme. It was nice. So for all you parents worrying...don&#39;t :)<br/>\nHeather<br/>\nsorry for the cross post.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31235,"nextTopicId":31212}}
