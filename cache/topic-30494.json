Even when she was a toddler, she would just want to sit quietly and observe people. If someone talked to her, she would just look at them and then turn her head into me. She still doesn&#39;t like new situations and it&#39;s hard for her to walk into a situation where she doesn&#39;t know anyone. I&#39;ve role played with her and given her &#39;script&#39; ideas for what to say/do, but unless she knows at least one other person, she&#39;s really uncomfortable. She won&#39;t approach anyone new by herself. It&#39;s still just too scary for her.<br/>\n  She&#39;s always been a deep thinker and I think her &#39;quiet/stillness&#39; is an intregal part of that. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s also why she&#39;s never been very comfortable in a large group setting (although that&#39;s changing now).<br/>\n  I remember when she was about 18 months, I looked after a friends kiddo for a couple of hours and it was a shock to the system (& my house LOL). Any surface that had anything on top of it at her level was cleared in one huge sweeping movement &lt;g&gt;. Tamzin would go pick stuff up and look at it or play with it, but she never just cleared a table top for the hell of it (she could&#39;ve, but she just never did). I remember Tamzin just watching Eva with a puzzled look, like &#39;why would you want to do that?&#39;. I kind of expected Tamzin to experiment with the concept either while Eva was there or maybe later on, but she never did.<br/>\n  So, yes, people would comment on how &#39;well behaved&#39; she was (especially when she was smaller).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;Everything Is Possible&quot;<br/>\n          ~ Deepak Chopra<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDon&#39;t let your dream ride pass you by.

I know if i was her i<br/>\n would just do my paperwork, a kid fooling around? No big deal. I have<br/>\n trouble with what the limits should be. <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not consider myself to be a permissive parent - in many ways I am<br/>\nstricter than my peers.  If I am going to spend all day everyday with my<br/>\nkids we need to be able to get along.  It can&#39;t be like the Wild Animal<br/>\nPark over here.  I try to treat my kids with the same respect and<br/>\ncompassion that I bring to my spouse, friends, and other adult<br/>\nrelationships.  I ask myself how I would respond if it was another<br/>\nadult.  Certainly I wouldn&#39;t stand in the doctor&#39;s office and scream<br/>\n&quot;Sit the hell down and be quiet!&quot;  I might lean over and say &quot;You seem<br/>\nreally antsy, wanna go get a snack?  Or go for a walk?&quot;  I would not<br/>\nallow my child to stand close to someone else, point and laugh - I do<br/>\nnot consider that to be respectful behavior.  If things got to that<br/>\npoint I would tell my child that was not a polite way to behave, and<br/>\nthen I would guide him out of the area into a space where he had more<br/>\nroom to be himself.  For us things wouldn&#39;t have gotten to that point -<br/>\nI probably would have had him sitting with me talking, or looking<br/>\nthrough magazines for pictures of cars or babies.  I would have worked<br/>\nhard to set up the appointment for a time when I had the best shot at<br/>\nhaving good behavior.  We would have eaten and used the bathroom before<br/>\ncoming inside.  We would have arrived unhurried, and probably looked at<br/>\na few bugs or rocks on the way in to the building.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often see parents who seem to be expecting more of their little ones<br/>\nthan they would of another adult.  I think that it is unreasonable to<br/>\nassume that in an interesting or novel environment kids aren&#39;t going to<br/>\nwant to touch anything, see anything, or ask any questions.  I mean that<br/>\nisn&#39;t how *I* behave!  My husband would know better than to try to get<br/>\nme to walk past a new yarn store without going inside to check it out. <br/>\nI should know better than to try to get my kiddo to walk past a toy<br/>\nstore without wanting to go in.  Just because my agenda doesn&#39;t involve<br/>\nwanting to go to the toy store - that doesn&#39;t make his desire<br/>\nunreasonable or invalid.  If I had a friend visiting I would say things<br/>\nlike &quot;its going to be a long drive, do you want to take a drink for the<br/>\ncar?&quot; or &quot;sometimes it is really cold in the city, let&#39;s bring your<br/>\ncoat.&quot;  I try to say these things to my kids too, in the same way, out<br/>\nof love, caring, because of my greater understanding of the whole<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child wants to run around, I try to honor that impulse.  Yet I do<br/>\nnot think that it is okay for him to run around during a wedding<br/>\nceremony, and I would not allow that behavior.  I believe that it is<br/>\nultimately in my child&#39;s best interests to learn to move in the adult<br/>\nworld - so that he can maximize his opportunities to do the things he<br/>\nfinds interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Do we ever stop comparing?","postDate":"1189545888","msgId":30513,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzN0YxMERFLTlGQzUtNDI0QS05RTg3LTg2OTE4Q0RDREQ3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZjNnZmbCthb2pyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZjNnZmbCthb2pyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30512,"nextInTopic":30515,"prevInTime":30512,"nextInTime":30515,"topicId":30494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My husband doesn t always think this way.

It&#39;s possible to be curious and  <br/>\nactive and still not a holy terror.  And it&#39;s possible for a mom to  <br/>\nthink (it seems, by comments some have made on discussion lists like  <br/>\nthis one) that as an unschooler she is forbidden (!?! yeah...) to  <br/>\n&quot;control&quot; her child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s somewhere between &quot;let them do nothing at all&quot; and &quot;let them do  <br/>\nanything they damned well please.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hanging around a lot with a 22 year old, schooled but curious  <br/>\nyoung man.  We&#39;re discussing lots of serious topics.  He feels he&#39;s  <br/>\nbeen deprived of lots of knowledge and ideas.  (He&#39;s right.)  He  <br/>\nwants to be more like Marty and Brett, he said (another unschooled  <br/>\nyoung man of his social acquaintance).   I&#39;m willing to help him.   <br/>\nBut sometimes he wants to disagree in such a way that he implies (or  <br/>\nsays) that his opinion is as valid as mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn some topics his opinion is way MORE valid than mine.  On some they  <br/>\nmight as well be equal.  On some, he needs to shut entirely up.  He  <br/>\nwill *tell* me how it is about marriage and love.  He will TELL me  <br/>\nthat there&#39;s nothing more important than defying authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to be more mature.  He has a reputation for being wild and  <br/>\nimmature.  He earned it, but he&#39;d like to shed it.  I&#39;m trying to  <br/>\nhelp.  He said he didn&#39;t want to lose it completely.   I&#39;m trying to  <br/>\npersuade him that there are times to let loose and be a smart-aleck  <br/>\nand to take the jab if people leave themselves open to a snappy  <br/>\ncomeback.  As an example, I said  that he wouldn&#39;t behave the same  <br/>\nway at a funeral as at a wedding (and the wedding reception would be  <br/>\ndifferent again).  He has never been to a funeral.  He&#39;s been to two  <br/>\nweddings, one very informal in a park.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he can&#39;t talk to me about funerals and weddings.  He can&#39;t talk to  <br/>\nme about relationships in an equal way, but he has several times said  <br/>\nthings like &quot;Well I disagree&quot; or &quot;Marriage only affects those two  <br/>\npeople and it&#39;s nobody else&#39;s business.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe himself is fairly well trashed by a divorce and remarriage of his  <br/>\nmom.  He despises his step father.  Yet his ideas are inflexible and  <br/>\nbased on nothing real.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when he disagrees with me he&#39;s being deeply disrespectful.<br/>\nSometimes when someone says they doubt my kids really are as I  <br/>\ndescribe them, that&#39;s being very disrespectful.<br/>\nSometimes when people say that if we cared about our kids we wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nrisk them by unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please don&#39;t think that unschooling requires parents to encourage  <br/>\nchildren to do whatever they want to regardless of other people&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings.

When he was two and three he tended to sit with me.  Then he  <br/>\ngot brave and curious and wanted to touch and mess with things.    <br/>\nFriends and strangers commented sometimes, and we would try to keep  <br/>\nhim reined in to the point that he wasn&#39;t disturbing other people  <br/>\nactually (not counting them being disturbed that we were letting him  <br/>\npick things up in stores and such, because outside the store owner it  <br/>\nwas okay with us--if store owners seemed uncomfortable I would hold  <br/>\nthe thing and let him touch it while I held it, or something like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther kids were being prevented.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result I saw in some of the prevented-kids, when they got older,  <br/>\nthose I knew longterm (and some I know still, in their young adult  <br/>\nlives) is that the spark of active curiosity was left cold.  By the  <br/>\ntime they were old enough for their parents to allow them to move and  <br/>\ntouch, they didn&#39;t so much want to anymore.  They were embarrassed,  <br/>\nbecause they didn&#39;t want to act like kids.  A false-ish maturity was  <br/>\non them.  They were acting mature.  Meanwhile, Kirby knew enough  <br/>\nabout the world around him that he was *being* mature.<br/>\n<br/>\nA comment was left on my blog this morning, not about Kirby but the  <br/>\nother two (who are 18 and 15) that said the teenagers in general (at  <br/>\nthe L&L conferences in general) are an inspiration and source of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot often in this world do people describe teens as an inspiration  <br/>\nand a source of wisdom.  Pretty cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to get the exact words, there was a newer comment:   <br/>\n&quot;Marty and Holly continue to be inspirations to me :)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWowie!  Wow.  That&#39;s very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am comparing my kids to other kids.  I can&#39;t help it.  But  <br/>\nI&#39;m happy with them, and they&#39;ll be home at 10:30 tonight and I&#39;ll  <br/>\ntell them thanks for my cut of their glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends who kept their kids so close and quiet when they were  <br/>\nlittle did it, I think, in hopes of praise from others down the line,  <br/>\nin hopes of success for their children.   I let mine explore and talk  <br/>\nand play in the same kind of hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t see or rightly guess the future.  We can only look at other  <br/>\npeople&#39;s lives and problems and behaviors and results and make our  <br/>\nown best choices in light of what we see and think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you compare, maybe look for the best things.  Look at him as you  <br/>\nwould an adult visitor from another culture.  Moving around a room  <br/>\nisn&#39;t bad in a hospital.  There are some times and places when it&#39;s  <br/>\nworse or better than others, and you can talk to your child about  <br/>\nthat and find him places where he can be more active.

My children, snuggled against me or running at my feet, seem wild<br/>\n- especially compared to the spaced out kids who are happy to be pushed<br/>\naround, placid and quiet, in strollers.  Sometimes I think I *really*<br/>\nwant a quiet child.  I think that this has a lot to do with our societal<br/>\ndislike of children and normal child behavior.  We are conditioned to<br/>\nbelieve that children should be quiet, controlled, unnoticed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to remind myself that what I am told is good in children is not<br/>\nwhat I like in adults.  I don&#39;t want to hang out with people who are<br/>\nbored (and boring), quiet, indifferent.  I want to hang out with people<br/>\nwho care, think, want, question, and dream - people like my kids.  So<br/>\nwhile they make shopping difficult, they make life interesting.  They<br/>\nare fabulous kids, and I am confident that they will make fabulous<br/>\nadults too.  I am sure that at some point my kids will learn to be quiet<br/>\nwhen necessary - but I am not sure that those other kinds of kids will<br/>\nlearn to be vivid life livers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I really doubt myself I read an article like &quot;Raise Children with A<br/>\nWild Streak&quot; which I have copied below.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nRaise children with a wild streak<br/>\nMany &#39;ideal&#39; students lack inventive, restless and self-reliant spirit<br/>\n<br/>\nby: Mark Pruett<br/>\n<br/>\nA new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics stresses the<br/>\nimportance of childhood playtime. It reinforces my own belief that many<br/>\nyoung adults have been cheated by years of excessive schoolwork and<br/>\nteamwork, too many extracurricular activities, and a straitjacketed<br/>\n&quot;just say no to anything risky&quot; upbringing. I am convinced that modern<br/>\nchildhood generally does not build enough independence and thirst for<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past few years I helped interview high school seniors seeking<br/>\nscholarships to come to Appalachian State University. These applicants<br/>\ncome from all over the state. They play instruments and sports,<br/>\nparticipate in church and charity, and work in diverse jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also display remarkably similar accomplishments. They are at the<br/>\ntop of their high school classes and possess generically good manners.<br/>\nThey lead teams, groups and clubs. They are smart, solid and<br/>\nhardworking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey might be surprised to learn that I, like many college professors,<br/>\nyearn for rarer traits -- curiosity, passion, a wild streak. Yes,<br/>\nteamwork and leadership skills will help your child to implement someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s ideas, and extensive extracurricular activities will foster<br/>\nresponsibility. What your child really needs, though, is an inventive,<br/>\nself-reliant, restless spirit.<br/>\nThe key questions<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the heart-wrenching interview moment is when we ask these<br/>\nteenagers what they would choose to do on a day spent alone. Many say<br/>\nthey never have the chance. Worse still, some have no answer at all.<br/>\nThis should disturb and sadden any parent. In the end, my scholarship<br/>\nvotes ride on two questions: Is this someone that I&#39;d be excited to have<br/>\nin my class? And is he or she open to being changed by my class? Class<br/>\nrank and extracurricular activities are less important than genuine<br/>\nindividuality or enthusiasm. It matters not whether someone is bold or<br/>\nshy, worldly or na&#65533;ve. Is there a flash of determination, a<br/>\nstreak of independence, a creative passion, an excited curiosity?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe need more students like the ones who leave after graduation to work<br/>\nas missionaries or in the Peace Corps. More like the ones who start<br/>\nsuccessful businesses while in school. More like the ones who find the<br/>\ncourage to go overseas for a summer or a semester because they know<br/>\ntheir own worlds are far too small.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome students are team players and high achievers, but I&#39;d trade them<br/>\nfor stubbornly creative iconoclasts. Some students as children were<br/>\ntaught to color inside the lines, watch Barney the purple dinosaur, and<br/>\nalways ask permission. We need students who found out what Crayons<br/>\ntasted like, loved reading &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and paid little<br/>\nattention to rules -- students whose parents encouraged their children&#39;s<br/>\ncuriosity.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\nSomething&#39;s missing<br/>\n<br/>\nThe irony is that many students begin to perceive late in college that<br/>\nthey&#39;ve missed something along the way. They regret not taking risks<br/>\nwith difficult professors, unusual courses or semesters abroad. They<br/>\nberate themselves by equating self-worth with grades, and they are<br/>\nsaddened by the realization that they have only glimpsed the breadth of<br/>\nthe university. They begin to grasp that their uncomfortable sense of<br/>\npassivity has its roots in the highly controlled existence foisted on<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents: love, guide and support your children, but don&#39;t insulate them,<br/>\ncontrol them or let them be too busy. Independence, confidence and<br/>\ncreativity come from freedom, risk and a good measure of unstructured<br/>\nsolitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncourage studying but make them play hooky, too -- partly to learn what<br/>\nit feels like to be unprepared and partly to foster spontaneity,<br/>\nirreverence and joy. Study chemistry together, then blow up a television<br/>\nin the backyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nFoster camaraderie and connectedness through group activities<br/>\n(especially family ones), but be unyielding in your commitment to<br/>\nteaching them to love doing things entirely on their own. Make each<br/>\nchild plan and cook the family&#39;s dinner on his or her own once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurround them with books, not video games. Raise a garden or build a<br/>\ndeck together. Send them on solo trips.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever you choose to do it, give your children, their teachers and<br/>\nsociety one of the greatest gifts of all: Help your kids become<br/>\ncreative, independent, curious, interesting people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Author<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Pruett is an assistant professor in the Walker College of Business<br/>\nat Appalachian State University.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, 11 Sep 2007 01:08:52 -0000, &quot;halfshadow1&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:halfshadow1@...\">halfshadow1@...</a>&gt; said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I did post this on AU but i also wanted Sandra&#39;s and other input too<br/>\n&gt; that i value here.<br/>\n&gt; When i am at a place like the hospital waiting room(my husband had a<br/>\n&gt; stroke a week ago,i have been quiet)and Lukas is running around the<br/>\n&gt; chairs and i glance over at the little girl sitting soooo nice with<br/>\n&gt; her mommy or when i went across the street to see my friends new baby<br/>\n&gt; and her grandson who is a few months younger than my Lukas, is sitting<br/>\n&gt; playing a video game, I ask him what he&#39;s playing and he answers in a<br/>\n&gt; mature way.
