When they voluntarily help we pay them for their time at the same rate as our adult employees. They offer to help from time to time for a variety of reasons (though they&#39;re young enough that the money doesn&#39;t seem to impact their decision to help or not). As they get older they seem more interested in helping. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter declined to help once, saying I got too grumpy with her the last time (which was true - being 5 at the time she just wasn&#39;t capable of doing what we both thought she could do and my reaction was not, er, particularly loving) and I admitted that and apologized and she has been more likely to volunteer and I&#39;ve been more comfortable saying &quot;no thank you&quot; if it&#39;s something she can&#39;t handle yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone&#39;s points about the history of farming, learning a reliable trade, etc, are perfectly valid. I would like to add, however, that the tradition of making one&#39;s children help without fiscal compensation has been one of the many things that mask the true cost of food in America. So many farming families make up the farm&#39;s economic loss by supplementing with outside income or reducing the loss by using unpaid labor, whether children or wwoofers. Who benefits from that unpaid labor? I would argue it&#39;s not the husband or the children or the farm but only the mistaken idea most people have that food is and should be cheap. <br/>\n<br/>\nAloha, Miliana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone; please excuse typos and auto corrections.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Chores in a family farm","postDate":"1330189518","msgId":65908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGppYjRjZStzN2RAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzAxMjM3MTguNTAwMS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65906,"nextInTopic":65909,"prevInTime":65907,"nextInTime":65909,"topicId":65886,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Of course some fled the farms and found other work, but the options were few and iffy.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, people have more options. By the time kids reach adulthood, they know they don&#39;t have to farm to survive. They have a world full of options. And if their childhoods on the farm feel like something they wish to escape from, they will.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time, if the goal was to raise farmers, it didn&#39;t matter as much whether kids enjoyed farming. It was a livelihood they learned the ins and outs of and it gave them a way to survive as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a days, if the goal is to raise farmers, it matters a a great deal whether the kids enjoy their lives on the farm. If the kids don&#39;t have pleasant memories, they have a world full of options to choose from when they&#39;re old enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, the goal is to raise kids who become responsible adults, radical unschoolers have found the &quot;common wisdom&quot; that kids &quot;need to learn responsibility&quot; by being made to do chores is not only unnecessary but often has the opposite effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat radical unschoolers have found to be true is that kids who are raised with choice, who are supported in their choices, accept the responsibilities -- the not as pleasant parts -- that go with the  choices they&#39;re making. It&#39;s a natural part of life. The extra tasks they take on build slowly. As they get older, as they get more skilled which makes previous tasks easier, they naturally grow into doing more &quot;set up&quot; and &quot;support&quot; tasks to get what they want. Until, when they&#39;re living more independently, they&#39;re tackling filing tax returns, paying for rent before a new video game because it&#39;s part of finding ways to do what they enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that people need to go through the motions of responsibility until it&#39;s so ingrained they won&#39;t choose not to, radical unschoolers find in practice is false when kids are given choice all along. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs adults, responsibilities are tasks we&#39;ve *chosen* to do to have the life we want. At first that sounds wrong. We can&#39;t just stop taking out the trash, clothing the kids, going to work, feeding the cows. Those are all responsibilities. Things we have to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if someone can mentally shift and realize that they are choosing to do those things because they don&#39;t want the consequences of not doing them, then they are choices. It&#39;s freeing to realize that. Every time you choose to mow the grass instead of letting it turn into a meadow, you&#39;re choosing to have a tended lawn. Every time you choose to tend the cows instead of selling them, you&#39;re choosing to have cows in your life. Every day you choose not to empty the bank account to take off for Fiji, you&#39;re choosing to spend that day with your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, someone has grown up being made to do chores to &quot;learn responsibility&quot;, what they really learn is that life is full of burdens, full of have tos and must dos. And the way to get through it is to stuff down your feelings and just do it. Then life is seen as full of unpleasant burdens that one must do. And when the goal is to just do what you must, it&#39;s harder to make thoughtful choices about what you want in your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the outside, a kid being made to feed a cow looks the same as an adult choosing to feed a cow. On the inside the two look nothing alike. The adult is choosing to feed the cow because he wants a life with cows rather than some other life. The kid is being made to work for the life his parent wants to live. Chores kids are made to do are not responsibilities. Kids can&#39;t choose when, how or whether to do something that better suits the life they want as adults can. Chores forced on kids are conscripted labor that kids must do to the standards the adults set. If the internal good parts of that labor for the child don&#39;t outweigh the bad parts, there are two common outcomes: the child learns to shut down and do what they &quot;have to&quot; without question, feeling the burdens of life they can&#39;t escape from or they refuse to do them and they leave as soon as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids leaving home as soon as they can to escape is so common most parents believe it&#39;s normal. It isn&#39;t. Kids leaving is normal. We&#39;re biologically wired to want to be able to &quot;do it ourselves&quot;. There&#39;s a really good video about what drives people to do difficult tasks:<br/>\n<br/>\nDrive (the full version -- Thank you, Claire :-)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html\">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat radical unschoolers have found is that kids who find home a comfortable nest where they were nurtured, don&#39;t stay forever. They do choose when they&#39;re ready to make their own lives, choosing the responsibilities *they* want in their lives. They willingly come back to touch base, to seek advice, but they grow up having learned responsibility without ever having been made.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean radical unschooled kids never help.

It helps to see the tasks as yours that you&#39;re asking someone else to lend you a hand on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat radical unschooling parents have found by 1) asking for help rather than requiring it, 2) thanking the child for setting aside their time and energy to help,  3) helping the child when asked, is that when the parents really do need help, the kids are very willing to help. (If kids have previously been made to do chores, it does take some healing time before they can feel they really do have a choice and this isn&#39;t some new tactic to get them to do their chores.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Chores in a family farm","postDate":"1330139785","msgId":65900,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzAxMzk3ODUuNjc0MTQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3Mzg4QTNCLTExNjktNDZCOS1BOUE5LUVFQzZBRDYyNkEzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzAxMTk5MjguOTYzNjcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDRCQ0NDNTgxLUMwM0MtNDI4Qy1BNjk1LUZEQzNFRkEwQkExREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzMzAxMjM3MTguNTAwMS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0FNU3U3TnhhRjZoUm1HTkJxdXowNHhwcy12NGIzZmd2Mz1HLVFac1J3Z3Vicm1jeUR3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FNU3U3TnlyNEJKcDBSQ0hRTmdnNFpPaTFxWEtmWTFEVmY3bTJNZ0M2Ykw3WkY4Q093QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE9ralY9NHZRcTFqVHgxM1d0Y1o1ZnMxV3J6R1BlMDkyYjJlVk0tMi09cT1RQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FNU3U3TnpuVk8ydGh4TnRUVlJmbjh6UXFOMkJGQlEteVN4LXI0ZG4rbmJlNU9VS2N3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MTMzMDEzNjkyNS45MjE0Mi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDcubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiA8ODczODhBM0ItMTE2OS00NkI5LUE5QTktRUVDNkFENjI2QTNGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65899,"nextInTopic":65905,"prevInTime":65899,"nextInTime":65901,"topicId":65886,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"They were in school before.

Interested to hear some responses.<br/>\n\t* from people.<br/>\n\t* It&#39;s way different then a city job forsure.<br/>\n\t* any place you think is good.<br/>\n\t* It&#39;s such a hard subject, I wonder about it all the time. How to handle it.<br/>\n\t* I think my husband can never change:((<br/>\n\t* His world is work, work, work.<br/>\n\t* I wish this could be easier.<br/>\n\t* but it is a HUGE point of contention here.<br/>\n\t* I feel like I am always saying&quot; Hurry up it&#39;s time for chores&quot;<br/>\n\t* I get it but he doesn&#39;t. Yes I also understand the need for help too. So HOW to see it?? I don&#39;t know<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n\t* <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65903,"nextTopicId":65533}}
