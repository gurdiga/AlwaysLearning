Fear based<br/>\nparenting can lead to a lot of unnecessary thought hindering the process<br/>\nof natural learning.  If a parent is fearing that a child may not learn<br/>\nto read, a child will pick up on that.  It&#39;s not going to help the<br/>\nnatural process of reading, and worse may hinder it.  Fear puts blocks<br/>\nto learning.  The optimal learning environment is happy and relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know that your child will read eventually, you can relax and then<br/>\nyour kids can relax.  If your focus is on being happy and having fun,<br/>\nhow can a child go wrong with that?  If the mind is open and happy and<br/>\nrelaxed all kinds of learning goes on!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know a few kids personally that are completely hindered by fear.  The<br/>\nparents don&#39;t see it and the kids don&#39;t see it, it has become so natural<br/>\nfor them to feel it and have it in their lives that they can&#39;t see it<br/>\nfor what it is.  There is a lot of fear in our culture, I won&#39;t go into<br/>\nthat too much.  I guess it&#39;s a choice to focus on a different part of<br/>\nlife, the part of life that is happy and natural and fun, so that when<br/>\nthere is real fear and real things that are unhappy, we can get through<br/>\nthem without it ruining us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m not making sense... I guess I feel pretty strongly that life<br/>\nis in a large part what you make it to be.  Anyone can make it fearful<br/>\nand hard, but it makes life more fulfilling to make it fun and happy.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When a child worries","postDate":"1219606382","msgId":37480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBFNEYyM0U4LUQwRDctNDVDMC05NzdELTg0NUE5MkFCRkQ4NEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc4c2F0ZStjNmJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc4c2F0ZStjNmJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37479,"nextInTopic":37481,"prevInTime":37479,"nextInTime":37481,"topicId":37401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

First, we (regular  <br/>\nposters on this list) are not here telling people to &quot;do the right  <br/>\nthing.&quot; We are here saying that you don&#39;t have to &quot;do school&quot; - that  <br/>\nkids can learn without curriculum, lesson plans, tests, grades,  <br/>\nassignments, or being taught in any usual sense of the word - and that  <br/>\nthe same principles that apply to learning conventional school  <br/>\nsubjects apply to other kinds of learning, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, there are plenty of parents who think they&#39;re &quot;doing the right  <br/>\nthing&quot; when they smack their kids around, when they shame them, and  <br/>\nall sorts of things. We&#39;re most definitely not here to help parents  <br/>\nthink they are doing the right (or wrong) thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling rests on a foundational set of beliefs about how children  <br/>\nlearn. I say, &quot;beliefs,&quot; because most people don&#39;t believe in them. It  <br/>\nstarted out more as a matter more of faith - it was based on an  <br/>\nunderlying view of human nature. But, there is now a considerable  <br/>\namount of evidence based on modern brain research to support these  <br/>\nbeliefs. We don&#39;t spend a lot of time looking at that research, but it  <br/>\nis out there and pretty much completely ignored by education  <br/>\nprofessionals. These days, though, many of us have grown unschooled  <br/>\nchildren who provide evidence enough to give us tremendous confidence  <br/>\nin unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re here to consider and examine and analyze unschooling principles  <br/>\nand to look at how they may be applied in a wide variety of real  <br/>\nsituations and circumstances. We know that the result of this kind of  <br/>\nanalytical process can be that parents come to more and more deeply  <br/>\nunderstand and embrace unschooling in ways they hadn&#39;t previously. We  <br/>\nknow that parents often become kinder and gentler with their children  <br/>\nas their thinking about how children learn changes. It isn&#39;t about  <br/>\nright or wrong. It isn&#39;t about parents feeling better or worse. It is  <br/>\nabout deepening our understanding of the basic principles and how they  <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: When a child worries","postDate":"1219605202","msgId":37478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4c2JzaSs5bzMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PElGRUFMQk1FRUZNSUhESUZIT0tLTUVCQUNPQUEuY2xhcmUua2lya3BhdHJpY2tAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":37477,"nextInTopic":37479,"prevInTime":37477,"nextInTime":37479,"topicId":37401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For anyone who does enjoy reading books to themselves, it s ... to ... books to ... bored. ... do, ... reader?!

In that world reading is a luxury good that may not help you to gain the skills you need to live life. Lots of people have had lives without reading. Lots of history is about people without books or computers. Now, this lifetime, there are parts of the world without books or computers. David (dh) interviewed Mayans in Belize who didn&#39;t have much schooling, and were illiterate, but knew what they needed to for getting the most money that they could for the produce that they grew and sold.  Lots of people, including those living in the U.S. or the UK or wherever, don&#39;t need to read to get the things that they want out of life. The interesting thing to David was that the people he met in Belize where perfectly capable of reading what they needed to read when they needed to read it, no matter what their age at first reading was. And none of the people he interviewed had reading<br/>\n material beyond the textbooks that their children used for school and for some, maybe, a bible. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not being as clear as I would like. My feeling is that if you live in a community without books and computers, for whatever reason, accessing those things is a way to get yourself excluded from that community. Or, at least, for the reading to be really useful, really applicable to your life, you would have to leave that community and find another. Not that I live in such a world. But many people do, not by choice, but by necessity. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon, my 11 year old son, is not reading yet. He has books and computers that fill our house and his life. I read to him, although not a lot these days, there just aren&#39;t books he wants to hear. He gets books on cd, I think being able to control when they start and stop is much more satisfying than having me read. For a long time I worried, very occasionally I still worry, but I know, and, more importantly, he knows, that reading will happen when it happens. Until then, I&#39;m not waiting or moaning, more than that I am utterly impressed with the things that he sees based on not reading. He listens so much more intently than I do, I&#39;ve read all of the Harry Potter books, he&#39;s listened to them, and he knows them better. If I&#39;d listened to them I&#39;d have to learn how, as Pam said she needed to do, I&#39;d have to figure out how to stop my mind chattering so much so that I could hear Stephen Fry or Jim Dale reading to me. I would remember far less than he does. He<br/>\n does that a lot, hears or sees a cue that I didn&#39;t see or hear. I did that when we lived in Japan and were completely illiterate. David would get the staff at the university to write out some of the Kanji that we needed to recognize for the bus to get home and the rest we had to figure out on our own. I still can&#39;t read or speak Japanese, but we had a full and wonderful life that year. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t read a lot these days. I used to read almost all the time. I would have many books on the go and would forgo many other things to read them. When I had Simon and Linnaea being present was more important than reading and my reading began to wane. Reading, it seems, was about filling the empty spaces, and when I had children I had fewer of those. My reading is beginning to rise again. I am reading a bit more now than I did last year, but my life is still more interesting than other people&#39;s literary view of life. I&#39;m not dismissing reading, but I do think that it is less valuable than it is often considered. Linnaea, my daughter, read at 6. She likes being able to read. But she doesn&#39;t read many books. Mostly it is about comics on the toilet, or quests on WoW. For books, she likes to snuggle up in bed at night and have me read to her. And Simon doesn&#39;t have any sense of less than by not reading as early as she did. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: When a child worries","postDate":"1219598175","msgId":37475,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4czUwditiYnZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PElGRUFMQk1FRUZNSUhESUZIT0tLTUVCQUNPQUEuY2xhcmUua2lya3BhdHJpY2tAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":37474,"nextInTopic":37476,"prevInTime":37474,"nextInTime":37476,"topicId":37401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I can quite understand that not everyone loves it, but for those that do, then how many more years of that joy you ll get if you are an early reader?!~~ It s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-733977458\">~~I can quite understand that not everyone loves it, but for those<br/>\nthat do, then how many more years of that joy you&#39;ll get if you are an<br/>\nearly reader?!~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not going to matter!<br/>\nWhether someone loves reading for pleasure or not, it doesn&#39;t matter<br/>\nif they read early or late.

We *can* be certain teaching to read doesn&#39;t work, otherwise the schools wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nhaving problems. Whether reading to them, playing word games and so on speeds development a little (because the child&#39;s making <br/>\nconnections) is impossible to say. It doesn&#39;t influence development in a large way, otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be unschooling kids in print rich <br/>\natmospheres who don&#39;t read until their teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child may desire to ride a bike, but unless they&#39;re developmentally ready for the coordination and everything else needed, they can&#39;t. Does <br/>\nriding a bike with training wheels help them be ready sooner? Once they&#39;re developmentally ready, will having ridden with training wheels <br/>\nfor a year or two get them upright quicker? Maybe. Who knows. But I&#39;m betting there isn&#39;t a huge difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I do have an anecdote. When Kat was 3 or 4, Carl held a Tae Kwon Do class for little kids. Just a fun thing. Nothing rigorous. Kat did the <br/>\nclasses for a year but she wasn&#39;t all that coordinated. She&#39;d go through the motions of punching and kicking but she looked awkward. (Other <br/>\nkids her age were more coordinated, though not all.) It wasn&#39;t until several years later, without further lessons, that she was playfully <br/>\nkicking and it actually looked coordinated and like a Tae Kwon Do kick. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, kids can pick up knowledge without being able to use it. But imposing that knowledge against the child&#39;s desire -- as schools do with <br/>\ntrying to make them learn to read -- can be a good way to turn them off of something. What good would learning to punch as a 3 yo do if <br/>\nKat had hated the process? Will she find Tae Kwon Do easier if she takes it up again? I don&#39;t know, but the ease wouldn&#39;t be worth the <br/>\nstruggle of imposing it on her (since it would also run the risk of turning her off).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, do things because they&#39;re fun, not because you think it will lead somewhere. Expose them to lots of stuff. Keep doing the stuff they <br/>\nenjoy. Drop the stuff they don&#39;t.

Early readers have a lot of benefits too - like being able<br/>\nto spend years and years reading amazing stories.  It&#39;s the pressure that&#39;s<br/>\nwrong, not the age IMO.

This is<br/>\nwhy later reading is very very cool. Kids who read later (who aren&#39;t<br/>\nshamed and aren&#39;t feeling pressured TO read), are more immersed in a<br/>\nhearing, listening, oral world and it shows.
