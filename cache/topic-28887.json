If my sil only knew the real<br/>\nreason :) She wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling, barely gets &quot;hs&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-My 14 year old son says I forgot to not judge.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  From what little you told us, it sounded as though you got fed up  <br/>\n&gt; with adults being judgmental and critical of the kids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I blew my cool and ended<br/>\n&gt; up hurting my sister in law&#39;s feelings.
