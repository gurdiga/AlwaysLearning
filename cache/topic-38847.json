The new program  <br/>\nis being offered in the form of Family Seminars - the kids don&#39;t go to  <br/>\nthe seminar, it is for the parents. If you&#39;re interested, contact the  <br/>\nclosest WeightWatchers meeting location and ask them if they happen to  <br/>\nbe hosting a seminar. The book they&#39;re giving out at the seminar is  <br/>\nbrand-new and is called &quot;Family Power.&quot; The book is really more for  <br/>\nfamilies with younger children and I don&#39;t see it as being very  <br/>\ncompatible with unschooling, really. But you could most definitely  <br/>\nutilize the ideas in the book if you focus more on support and  <br/>\ncooperation and not on parental enforcement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideal, in my opinion, for teens, is to focus on healthy foods,  <br/>\nbeing aware of how hungry you are and only eating enough to &quot;just&quot;  <br/>\nsatisfy hunger, not more. Don&#39;t eliminate treats, but try to eat lots  <br/>\nof bulky foods that fill you up. Choose lower fat versions of foods  <br/>\nwhen it doesn&#39;t compromise taste too much. Choose foods that are low  <br/>\nin calories, low in fat, and high in dietary fiber. And get active -  <br/>\ntry for at least an hour per day of movement - vary what you do, if  <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to lose weight, but do try to be healthy and active and not  <br/>\neat when not hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I joined WeightWatchers, it wasn&#39;t like I didn&#39;t already know all  <br/>\nabout how to lose weight. There is no big secret there - take in fewer  <br/>\ncalories than you put out. The program is awesome in the way it helps  <br/>\nyou slowly change the way you eat while still really enjoying food and  <br/>\nnot feeling deprived at all. But I was suprised how the support in the  <br/>\nmeetings meant a lot to me - I made friends, we applauded each other  <br/>\nand helped each other through setbacks. It was very fun. A number of  <br/>\nother people I know also joined after they saw that I was having such  <br/>\nsuccess and enjoying it so much. What we all found was that we needed  <br/>\nto shop around for a meeting leader we were inspired by - different  <br/>\nleaders will be good for different people. I loved my leader who  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give &quot;lectures&quot; but acted more as a facilitator encouraging  <br/>\neveryone in the meeting to offer ideas. She was very high energy and  <br/>\npositive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, being active was really just as important as food. I could  <br/>\nbarely walk to the corner without my feet aching, at the beginning. So  <br/>\nthat&#39;s what I did. Then I walked around the block. Every week I did a  <br/>\nlittle more walking and one day I just felt like jogging a bit.  <br/>\nSurprised myself, for sure! My knee had been in such bad shape that I  <br/>\nwas probably going to have surgery - it is fine now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are quite a few good books out there right now about weight loss/ <br/>\nhealthy eating. &quot;Volumetrics&quot; is good.
