But what makes a choice unschooling is not the choice but *why*  the choice is made. Labeling choices as unschooling, moves the focus to the surface. Which is misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\nA philosophy is a tool people use to live a certain way. In the case of unschooling, the certain way of living is to create a rich, supportive atmosphere for kids to explore their interests in, knowing it will allow them to grow an understanding of the world and discover who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe (unschooling) tool helps people decide whether a choice will move them towards that or away.

Someone got stuck on this line: &quot;the focus is not on learning&quot; and worried that maybe they weren&#39;t focusing enough on the learning. That maybe they were focusing too little on the learning while doing other things with their children. I assume, and responded as such, that the argument being made was that unschooling takes time in, hands on, time together stuff. That unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily require that one be aware of the learning outcome of one event or another, but that a big part of the life of an unschooling parent is finding new and interesting things to put in front of their children, that a big part of the life on an unschooling parent is working to connect with their children and to spend time with their children. Lots of time with their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of that, I would add, and maybe it&#39;s implied, that an unschooling parent, in order to unschool well, to find at the end of a few years that things have happened, ought to explore the fundamentals of learning. Learning is bigger and brighter and smaller and more mundane than school would have you believe. It is happening all the time. But there are conditions in which learning can be epiphany rich and pleasurable and filled with awe and other conditions where learning is largely about how to get by and feeling badly and ways to not feel so bad and it never looks like an outcome that you would have aimed for if you&#39;d been laying it out in your mind. I think it helps to see what learning can be, how connections can happen and how play is valuable in making those things good and bright. But that&#39;s bigger picture stuff than what someone might see when they read something about focusing on the learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Mostly Unschooling&quot;","postDate":"1358734118","msgId":70299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTg3MzQxMTguODEwMjIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCNkNFNzg5LUNBN0ItNEM4Ni05RERBLUQzNDM2OURCNDZBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtkaGhpbCtyaGkzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM1ODcyMDM1OC41MTAzOS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIwOTAzLm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDdCNkNFNzg5LUNBN0ItNEM4Ni05RERBLUQzNDM2OURCNDZBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70297,"nextInTopic":70300,"prevInTime":70298,"nextInTime":70300,"topicId":70288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** Control is a broad area.
