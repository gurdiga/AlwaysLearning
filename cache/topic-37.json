You have a healthy toddler! Despite our best efforts to <br/>\nunderstand them, they can apparently either devour entire houses or live like <br/>\nbirds on the tiniest morsels, or both, on alternating days :^) <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, don&#39;t worry. If he is healthy otherwise, there is no reason to <br/>\nfear. He won&#39;t starve himself. My mom is a nutritionist, and she assures me <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t grow up dead, despite being a non-eating toddler. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about getting that &quot;balanced diet&quot; all in one day -- work it out <br/>\nover the week, and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s doing pretty well. Believe me, he could be <br/>\ndoing a lot worse than rice crispies and milk. And if he likes raisin bran, <br/>\nthat&#39;s all the better (more iron & fiber)!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for junk food, rid the house of candy and other empty calories; offer <br/>\nenriched substitutes. Does he like muffins? Great! Make yours extra-good by <br/>\nadding in pureed butternut squash or pumpkin or carrots or zucchini to spike <br/>\nthe vitamins. Powdered milk, whole wheat flour, bran, these are also great <br/>\nadd-ins. If you are meat-eaters, powdered milk and shredded veggies added to <br/>\nmeatloaf ups calcium, protein and vitamins. There are recipes floating around <br/>\nout there for healthy versions of a lot of &quot;forbidden&quot; things (cakes, <br/>\ncookies, etc.) that are fabulous. Write me if you are looking for something <br/>\nin particular and can&#39;t find it on the web. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Barring allergies or other food restrictions) apple, orange or pear slices <br/>\n(etc.) can be dipped in yogurt, (natural) peanut butter or pureed OTHER <br/>\nfruit. A wonderful playdough can be made from peanut butter, honey and <br/>\npowdered milk. It&#39;s still a sweet, but you can control the level of honey. <br/>\nFrench fries can be made from sweet potatoes and baked in the oven! These <br/>\nhave more vitamins and are truly yummy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s a matter of presentation: toddlers who won&#39;t touch carrots or <br/>\nother veggies when they are whole will sometimes happily wolf them down when <br/>\nyou shred them and make a pile of &quot;hay.&quot; Those who won&#39;t eat sliced cheese <br/>\nmight be very happy with string cheese. Leaving beans whole and eating them <br/>\nlike french fries can be fun. Dehydrated foods can be fun -- making your own <br/>\nfruit leather can be something they can help with (stirring and measuring), <br/>\nand can be a great alternative to candy or commercial &quot;fruit&quot; leather <br/>\n(although I hear my mom&#39;s voice in my head still, &quot;whole fruits are better <br/>\nthan dried or juices&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I&#39;ve noticed about my children-as-toddlers is that they are <br/>\nvery charmed by mini versions of anythings, mini-pancakes (which you&#39;ve <br/>\nenriched with whole wheat, powdered milk and fruit or pumpkin, etc., and <br/>\nwhich my daughter thinks are better than cookies), mini-meatloaves (just <br/>\nenough for one toddler), mini-casseroles baked in their own little dish <br/>\n(muffin or custard cups work well for both of the previous), mini-pastas, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do try new foods out, do them with a minimum of flourish or pressure <br/>\n(but you already knew that). The only rule in our house is that you must <br/>\ntaste it once before leaving it alone on the plate (no yelling of YUCK, <br/>\nplease!). I only introduce one new food at a time. If it is rejected, I <br/>\nrotate that one out for a while, but try it again a month or so later. <br/>\nTypically, if you don&#39;t make a big deal about it, neither will they, and <br/>\nexposure to a wide variety of foods will eventually yield results in their <br/>\nwillingness to try new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it will not cure the bird appetite. For that, I just made a mantra of my <br/>\nmom&#39;s words (He will not starve himself he will not starve himself he will <br/>\nnot starve himself He&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s ready he&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s ready...) <br/>\n:^) Some folks give a multi-vitamin and others don&#39;t. Either way, just relax <br/>\nand try not to...worry :^) If he&#39;s truly hungry, he&#39;ll let you know, and if <br/>\nhe&#39;s running around and active, that hungry time WILL eventually happen :^)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoops--just noticed how long this got, sorry! Hope it helps. All the <br/>\ndiscussion so far on other topics has been very interesting and helpful to <br/>\nme. I&#39;m really glad to be here :^)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nWynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33,"nextTopicId":49}}
