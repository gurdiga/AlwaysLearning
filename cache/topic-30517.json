The funny thing  is that while in <br/>\nschool (Public School K-3rd) he aced Spelling tests.  He  won tons of Spelling <br/>\nawards.  He made A&#39;s in Spelling straight down the  line every year.  He still <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t spell.  After we started  homeschooling (not unschooling) he still <br/>\naced Spelling tests but could not spell  in real life situations.  I was awful <br/>\nabout it, too.  When he would  ask me how to spell a word (while making a <br/>\nbirthday card or labeling something  he drew or whatever) I would say &quot;you know <br/>\nwhere the dictionary is.&quot;  What  a crappy mom!  Since our unschooling life has <br/>\nbegun, he&#39;s gotten  comfortable again asking me how to spell something for <br/>\nMySpace or something and  I happily tell him and he remembers for next time.  <br/>\nImagine that...no  tests, no drills.  If he forgot, I&#39;d happily tell him again if <br/>\nhe  asked.  Now he&#39;s a decent speller.  Probably no Spelling awards in his  <br/>\nfuture, but he does okay.
