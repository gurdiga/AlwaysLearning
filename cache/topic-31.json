So Sandra can, typically, say, &quot;Marty, that&#39;s loud,&quot; <br/>\n(she doesn&#39;t even have to make a request - just gently bring his <br/>\nattention to it) and Marty would immediately become cognizant of his <br/>\nsurroundings, recognize what other people were trying to do there, <br/>\nunderstand that his loudness was impinging on their ability to do it, <br/>\nand he would CARE enough to inconvenience himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, sometimes a child may not see the sense in a request. The <br/>\nassumption that a child is rational is generally true, imo, but that <br/>\nrationality is constrained by their knowledge and their ability to <br/>\npredict consequences AND their ability to be empathetic.  Although <br/>\ndiscussing it helps them along in that development, they may simply not <br/>\nhave enough background knowledge, they may confuse what they hope would <br/>\nbe the consequences with the actual possible consequences and they <br/>\nsimply may not care.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to give information first - without any request or command. <br/>\n&quot;There is a sign posted here that says no running.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I said to my husband when he started to park the car last <br/>\nnight, &quot;There is a sign there that says no parking.&quot; I didn&#39;t just <br/>\nshout, abruptly, &quot;Don&#39;t park there.&quot; Good thing, too, because in the <br/>\nsmall print, that I couldn&#39;t read, it said, &quot;Except Sundays.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally there is a reason for a sign that says, &quot;No running.&quot; I mean, <br/>\nthere was some reason why someone decided to put it there.

But any closer to the buildings and there are <br/>\nstudents who tend to wander around with their heads in their books (or <br/>\nin the clouds).

Respecting these rules is <br/>\n&gt; something of a morality issue for me.  I know that most often the <br/>\n&gt; &#39;real&#39; reason for such rules is liability protection for the owner or <br/>\n&gt; responsible party.  Someone in risk management or the insurance <br/>\n&gt; company has assessed a set of risks, and the possible fallout <br/>\n&gt; (legal/financial) for the property and determined which risks they <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t willing to underwrite. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example, if a child ignores the rule and is seriously injured, it <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be you, the parent, who decides which insurance company will pay <br/>\n&gt; out -- it will be decided by the insurance company when it determines <br/>\n&gt; it can shift the &#39;blame&#39; or responsibility elsewhere (to another <br/>\n&gt; insurance company).  That&#39;s how insurance lawsuits happen.  Remember <br/>\n&gt; the woman burned by the overly hot coffee at McDonalds?  She didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; make the decision to sue McD&#39;s -- Medicare did, when they found they <br/>\n&gt; could shift the cost to some other entity.  In the hot tub situ, the <br/>\n&gt; insurance could then demand that the hot tub be removed before <br/>\n&gt; continuing to insure the property, since the managers were negligent <br/>\n&gt; (in the ins. co&#39;s opinion).  Then everyone loses a hot tub. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you want someone else&#39;s children to come to your home and flout <br/>\n&gt; all your rules, because they were told it&#39;s okay to ignore rules they <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would depend upon the child, the rules, the reasons, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t have a bunch of rules in my house.  What rules would they <br/>\nnot follow?  The few rules I have are safety rules, designed to keep the <br/>\npeople (not the children) who are in my house safe.  If a person (not a <br/>\nchild, but a person of any age) decided to not follow rules that I <br/>\nconsider those of safety, then that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s their choice, but <br/>\nthen I would react to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if a person, say--my sister in law--decided that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to wear a seat belt in my car.  That&#39;s a rule I have, and <br/>\none that is not negotiable.  All children who need to be in a boster or <br/>\nsafety seat are in a safety seat.  All others need to wear a seat belt.  <br/>\nIf my sister in law doesn&#39;t want to wear a seat belt, that&#39;s OK.  But <br/>\nthen, she can&#39;t ride in my car.  I take a boy home from school about 3-4 <br/>\ntimes a week.  He doesn&#39;t wear seat belts in his mother&#39;s car.  He does <br/>\nin mine.  The one time he said he doesn&#39;t wear seat belts, I said great, <br/>\nget out.  Good bye.  I told him that in my car everyone wears seat <br/>\nbelts, or they aren&#39;t in my car.  Period.  He made an informed <br/>\nchoice--to put his seat belt on (the alternative was to walk through a <br/>\nhorrible neighborhood at dusk, where gangs hang out.) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, I&#39;ve never had an issue with the very few rules I have.  I <br/>\ntreat everyone, regardless of age, as though they are reasonable, <br/>\nresponsible humans who want to be safe and who generally act in a <br/>\nreasonable way.  I take lots of children lots of places, and I&#39;ve rarely <br/>\nhad a child do things which are unsafe or might cause damage to property <br/>\nor others.  The few times a behavior like that began, a conversation <br/>\nwould begin.  We would talk about the situation and why that action was <br/>\nnot acceptable, and because I treated the child as though they were <br/>\nreasonable, they either saw the reason for not behaving in that way or <br/>\nwe found an alternative. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been, more than once, a problem with adults.

Just a guess, but I bet you are putting a lot more thought into how you are being with your kids than she did when you were little.    If you are putting this much thought into your parenting skills, I think you must be a one good mom! <br/>\nJust because your oldest is going through some rough times, doesn&#39;t mean you have &quot;failed&quot; as a parent.  <br/>\n    You&#39;ve used this &quot;pond&quot; thingy as an example.  It reminds me of a Thomas the Tank Engine episode where Thomas didn&#39;t feel like heeding a sign that said &quot;Danger&quot; and he wound up falling into some water.  The idea the writer was trying to get across was that sometimes you don&#39;t know why the rule is there, so it&#39;s best to follow it.  I&#39;ve heard things like that pond called an attractive nusiance.  My husband had to put a huge (expensive) fence around something just like that in a subdivision he was building.  The city required the fence because kids aren&#39;t going to read a sign and they aren&#39;t going to figure out how dangerous that thing is until they&#39;ve already fallen in.  <br/>\n    I am trying to give my kids as much freedom as I can, but I can think of  *lots* of things they can&#39;t do.  They are 11 and 9, so I can explain to them when I&#39;m acting based on my own insecurities. They have their own quirky worries, too, which I try to respect, so they are patient with mine.  There are lots of situations, though, where I still just have to tell them to &quot;Stop that.&quot;  Maybe I can explain later what the deal was, but when they were toddlers, I needed them to &quot;mind me&quot; immediately for safety reasons.  For example, I can&#39;t let a toddler run in a busy parking lot.   I guess the overall principle is that my job is to keep them safe.  As they get older, they take on some of that responsibility for themselves, just like they start doing more and more about getting fed.  And that&#39;s a real balancing act for me.  I want them to do as much for themselves as they can, but I don&#39;t want them burdened with too much responsibility.  <br/>\n    One more thought.  My life got a lot more peaceful when I mentally promoted myself to the rank of &quot;adult&quot; and demoted my parents and my in-laws to the rank of &quot;an adult friend.&quot;  I allow only as much comment/criticism/advice from them as I would accept from any other adult friend.   Any more than that and they are being controlling or abusive, and I start limiting my contact with them.    I don&#39;t know about your mother, but I doubt my mother would ever think of me as a competent adult.   I had to make that decision for myself--when I was 33!  <br/>\n    Deirdre in Alabama<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sylvia Toyama <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 8:17 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] (unknown)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Really?

For example, at our neighborhood park there is a sign that reads No Fishing, No Wading No Swimming at the pond. Actually it&#39;s just a big drainage basin, but it does have fish, ducks and frogs -- it also has a rough concrete finish, and the water is beyond skanky and filthy.  The rule exists for a good reason.  Besides, the entire time they are leaning over the edge looking for fish, I&#39;m truly very worried someone will fall in and be hurt.  I realize it&#39;s obssesive, but it&#39;s one of my genuine phobias, so in that case, I&#39;m glad I can cite the rule and herd them back towards the playground.  Maybe I should more closely examine my motives, and how I respond.<br/>\n<br/>\n     For that matter, it might be best if everyone just discounts much of what I say this weekend -- I&#39;ve just been thru an &#39;encounter&#39; with my Mom where she has AGAIN offered unsolicited advice for how I should be disciplining my children, the many mistakes I&#39;ve made with my oldest (and the current fall-out he&#39;s working thru) adn how I really need to look at my methods and make sure I prevent the same mistakes with the other two....  and I&#39;m a little defensive and scattered right now.

Respecting these rules is something of a morality issue for me.  I know that most often the &#39;real&#39; reason for such rules is liability protection for the owner or responsible party.  Someone in risk management or the insurance company has assessed a set of risks, and the possible fallout (legal/financial) for the property and determined which risks they aren&#39;t willing to underwrite.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor example, if a child ignores the rule and is seriously injured, it won&#39;t be you, the parent, who decides which insurance company will pay out -- it will be decided by the insurance company when it determines it can shift the &#39;blame&#39; or responsibility elsewhere (to another insurance company).  That&#39;s how insurance lawsuits happen.  Remember the woman burned by the overly hot coffee at McDonalds?  She didn&#39;t make the decision to sue McD&#39;s -- Medicare did, when they found they could shift the cost to some other entity.  In the hot tub situ, the insurance could then demand that the hot tub be removed before continuing to insure the property, since the managers were negligent (in the ins. co&#39;s opinion).  Then everyone loses a hot tub.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWould you want someone else&#39;s children to come to your home and flout all your rules, because they were told it&#39;s okay to ignore rules they don&#39;t agree with?  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet better spam protection with Yahoo!

I like some of their ideals, mostly the <br/>\nidea that children have rights and should be treated with respect.  But <br/>\nanyone who knows me knows I don&#39;t unparent.

And if your rules were reasonable, then my children <br/>\nwould have absolutely no problem following them, because they are also <br/>\nreasonable.  However, if you put a big dish m&ms down in front of my <br/>\nkids and said &quot;these m&ms are for adults who are over 50 years old only <br/>\nand no one else may touch them, I have no reason for that rule, I just <br/>\ndo it because I like to control people&quot;, both my children and I would <br/>\nprobably find some reason to leave rather quickly and would also <br/>\nprobably find a store pretty quickly to buy our own m&ms.  Sure, they <br/>\nare your m&ms, and sure, it&#39;s your house, and sure, it&#39;s your rule.  But <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean we have to be there--in that case you can have your <br/>\nrights over your space and property, we&#39;ll go to a park and eat m&ms by <br/>\nourselves! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I doubt there&#39;s anyone here who just opens their home up to any bypassing<br/>\n&gt; people to do what they want to.  I doubt that anyone here who has a <br/>\n&gt; store or has<br/>\n&gt; ever worked in a store, would just let kids cut loose and do whatever,<br/>\n&gt; regardless.  And if you had a family with kids and they were letting <br/>\n&gt; their kids use<br/>\n&gt; their own judgment about what to take off shelves and what to do with <br/>\n&gt; it here&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; where it matters:   Are those kids doing things you&#39;re comfortable <br/>\n&gt; with them<br/>\n&gt; doing?  If so, it&#39;s not a problem.  If not, and their parents have said<br/>\n&gt; &quot;question rules and don&#39;t do anything an adult tells you,&quot; I think <br/>\n&gt; that parent has<br/>\n&gt; done a disservice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But you need to quote me correctly.  There is a very important word <br/>\nmissing--blindly.  I do teach my children to never BLINDLY follow <br/>\nrules.  I do teach my children to never BLINDLY trust an adult, simply <br/>\nbecause they are an adult.  I do want them to question authority.  I do <br/>\nwant them to make informed choices.  Sometimes my kids follow rules <br/>\nabout which they don&#39;t agree, simply because they want to participate in <br/>\nan activity (such as not getting in the hot tub because they wish to <br/>\nswim in the regular pool).  Other times we fudge things a bit so they <br/>\ncan participate (like saying Janene is in 1st grade this year so she can <br/>\nbe a Girl Scout Brownie, when she really would be, if she were in <br/>\nschool, a K.  Or saying Lexie is 9, instead of 8, so she can participate <br/>\nas a pre-teen at the conference.)  Personally, I think it&#39;s good common <br/>\nsense for people to think for themselves.  Most of the time, my kids <br/>\nfollow the rules, or do as an adult has asked them to do, because the <br/>\nrule and request are reasonable.  Sometimes they do it because it&#39;s too <br/>\nmuch bother to do otherwise--learning to pick their battles is another <br/>\nimportant lesson. <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend once said that she wanted her children to learn two <br/>\nthings--question authority and consider the source.  Here is my list, or <br/>\nprobably the beginning of my list...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion authority<br/>\nConsider the source<br/>\nMake informed decisions<br/>\nPick battles carefully<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest things I see about homeschooling, is that there <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be the need for a bunch of rules, which schools, and <br/>\nparents of schooled children, need--to simply control the masses.  As a <br/>\nteacher of 30 kids, I need a bunch of rules to control the herd.  As a <br/>\nparent of two, especially as those two are treated with respect, and are <br/>\nreasonable humans who honor logic, there is little need for rules.  <br/>\nInstead, we can simply talk about the situation, and make informed <br/>\ndecisions about the best way to proceed. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you oon&#39;t teach my children to blindly follow rules or to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another adult says, ever.

And depending <br/>\n&gt; whose ramp<br/>\n&gt; that was and who else was present, it&#39;s not a matter for morality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, not morality, but for thinking.  Many rules are there for a reason. <br/>\nThey are logical and reasonable and enforcable.  Other rules are there <br/>\nfor no reason.  For instance, in our townhome, there is a rule that no <br/>\none under 14 can be in the hot tub, ever.  When we researched this and <br/>\nasked them why there was a rule, they came up with a lot of &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nsounding answers.  Children over heat easily.  Children might pee in the <br/>\nhot tub.  Upon really looking at this, we discovered that older adults <br/>\nalso might pee in the tub.  Also, older adults are often more prone to <br/>\noverheating because of medical problems.  Furthermore, older adults are <br/>\nlikely to have more issues with hot tubs when drugs or alcohol are being <br/>\nused.  There are  no dangers for children in hot tubs as long as they <br/>\nare following rules which keep them safe.  So, their reasons for their <br/>\nrule was not logical.  It was not reasonable.  We went to a board <br/>\nmeeting and gave them page after page about how children are safe in hot <br/>\ntubs if reasonable caution is observed, such as not staying in for <br/>\nlonger than about 10 minutes, which are, by the way, the same guidelines <br/>\nfor everyone else.  We petitioned the board to change the rule.  They <br/>\ndid not.  So, we talked to the girls about civil disobdience.  We found <br/>\nout what would happen if they violated the rule (we&#39;d loose swimming <br/>\nprivledges for a month).  The girls made the decision that they did not <br/>\nwant to get into the hot tub that much, but would instead rather follow <br/>\nthe rules, so they could swim in the pool.  THAT is an informed decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ch ildren don&#39;t stand on shelving in grocery stores.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthey ever would even do that.  But they don&#39;t NOT do it because it&#39;s a <br/>\nrule.  They don&#39;t do it because it&#39;s not safe, it could hurt a person, <br/>\nor thing, or cause damage which would cost money to fix.  My children <br/>\nare reasonable human beings who, when asked not to do something that is <br/>\nreasonable, don&#39;t do it.  It doesn&#39;t matter who tells them.  They can <br/>\nunderstand why running down stairs might be dangerous.  They can <br/>\nunderstand why running down a ramp might be dangerous. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I agree with this, but I also think I have a responsibility to help <br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; to think for themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s worth suggesting that in some circumstances, they don&#39;t get to <br/>\n&gt; think for<br/>\n&gt; themselves.  If they&#39;re visiting somewhere and the owner of a fragile <br/>\n&gt; item<br/>\n&gt; says &quot;Don&#39;t play with that, it&#39;s 300 years old,&quot; that&#39;s a rule and a <br/>\n&gt; directive<br/>\n&gt; they should&#39;nt BEGIN to think about ignoring, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find it interesting that this is coming from you, Sandra.  If they are <br/>\nvisiting someone&#39;s house, and that house is filled with a great deal of <br/>\nfragile items, I would mention this fact upon my knowing this fact.  <br/>\n&quot;Janene, this man&#39;s house is filled with great items that are about 300 <br/>\nyears old, can we look with our eyes?  It would be horrid to drop <br/>\nsomething that is not replacable, so it&#39;s easier to look with our eyes, <br/>\neven mommy, than to risk such a thing.&quot;  My children, being reasonable <br/>\nhumans who are generally respected and are thoughtful individuals, would <br/>\nsee the sense to such a request.  It doesn&#39;t have to be RULE, it&#39;s <br/>\ncommon sense.  It&#39;s also common sense that if there is a child, Janene <br/>\nperhaps, who just has a harder time being quiet and gentle and such, <br/>\nthen she probably needs to not go into the room with fragile items. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think some rules are arbitrary and wrong  I don&#39;t think anyone, <br/>\nincluding children, should just follow rules.  I think they s hould <br/>\nthink for themselves, and decide for themselves.  And I don&#39;t think <br/>\npeople should make up rules simply to have rules.  I would assume that <br/>\nif you don&#39;t want people to run down your stairs, there is a reason.   I <br/>\nalso think that if you told my children that rule, and Lexie said &quot;what <br/>\nis the reason behind your rule?&quot; you would answer that question and have <br/>\na reasonable answer.  Lexie would see the logic in that rule and so <br/>\ntherefore following that rule would not be an issue.  Same for shelves <br/>\nin a store.  Logically it makes no sense to climb on these, because the <br/>\nconsequences might be someone gets hurt or property is damaged.  <br/>\nReasonable children who are treated with respect can understand <br/>\nreasonable rules, even if unwritten, and follow those rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

And though I don&#39;t want my children to blindly follow an adult<br/>\n(or another child, for that matter) I do hope they can learn to respect<br/>\ndifferences.   We have all kinds of friends, and being &#39;liberal&#39; as far as<br/>\nparenting goes, many of our friends have more rules then we have. I would<br/>\nnever encourage my kids to break other people&#39;s rules in their homes just<br/>\nbecause we disagree with it. We respect their right to make whatever rules<br/>\nthey want in their own homes. If we enjoy their company enough to want to<br/>\nspend time with them in their home, then we will live with their rules while<br/>\nthere.  Obviously, I don&#39;t mean following rules that I think will harm my<br/>\nchildren. I&#39;m thinking of things like having to sit at the table until<br/>\neveryone is done eating.  Or not being able to watch certain shows at their<br/>\nhouse.  As far as rules in society....we have many discussions about why the<br/>\nrule is there. Who is the rule protecting (often it&#39;s more to protect<br/>\nsomeone from litigation than from actual harm to a participant), what<br/>\nhappens if you break the rule (both personally, i.e.. injury, or legally,<br/>\ni.e.. a ticket, maybe being asked to leave,  or maybe nothing will happen),<br/>\nthat sort of thing.  Teaching kids to respect rules and laws does not mean<br/>\nwe have to teach blind obedience.  We also talk about lots of the rules and<br/>\nlaws that exist that society turns a blind eye to. No one drives the speed<br/>\nlimit on the express ways in our area.  Our current pet peeve rule is that<br/>\nmy 15 yod cannot go to an R rated movie without me being present.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike the theaters deciding that I have to be there. I don&#39;t like most R<br/>\nmovies and have little desire to go.  To me, it&#39;s a stupid rule. Do I<br/>\nunderstand why it&#39;s there? Sure. But I still disagree. Do we break it?<br/>\nDepends....sometimes they have a &#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39; philosophy and she<br/>\ncan get in. Other times, they ask for Id...then she&#39;s out of luck if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen to be the one to drive her.  It&#39;s pretty arbitrary, depending<br/>\non the mood of who&#39;s collecting tickets.  And then again....would I want a<br/>\nsociety with no rules or laws?  Would I want to visit a home that didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave some kind of standard of behavior? (I&#39;ve seen homes like that...it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a pretty sight!)

I think I want to try to <br/>\n  get back to some kind of normal here, and am hoping a little <br/>\n  discussion might help.  My son Sam fell through the ice at a local <br/>\n  park while there with a friend and his family.  He left at 1:00 that <br/>\n  afternoon and at 5:30 we recieved the phone call.  That was Jan. 19, <br/>\n  and I&#39;m still trying to accept that he&#39;s not coming home.   I&#39;m not <br/>\n  ready to write about it yet.  I want to write a journal, but haven&#39;t <br/>\n  been able to put much down.<br/>\n  What I do want to write about here is how absolutely grateful I have <br/>\n  felt about unschooling.  It was one of the first thoughts that came <br/>\n  into my mind when I started to be able to think again.  Thank God we <br/>\n  found this path.  Thank God not a minute was wasted.  I&#39;m not <br/>\n  religious, though I find myself in a state of transition when it <br/>\n  comes to my spirituality.  But I don&#39;t know who else to thank. <br/>\n  Though I do want to thank all of you people who have helped me on <br/>\n  this journey.  I don&#39;t need to explain here what I mean by all of <br/>\n  this.  We know what we&#39;re doing here when it comes to giving our <br/>\n  children real lives.  Lives spent full of joy and wonder.  That&#39;s how <br/>\n  Sam has been described over and over.  Full of joy.<br/>\n  Our whole town came out in support of us.  It was beautiful and <br/>\n  overwhelming.  I&#39;m still getting it.<br/>\n  We recieved donations and we&#39;re taking our time, but we want to give <br/>\n  in him name through the years.  While many people are on a campaign <br/>\n  to try to prevent tragedies like this from happening again, I keep <br/>\n  coming to the thought of trying to find a way to help parents really <br/>\n  understand how precious every minute is with their children.  <br/>\n  Appreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>\n  advantage of the now. <br/>\n  I have 3 other children and life is moving forward.  We still find <br/>\n  lots of joy in it.  Our picture is in the photos section here if you <br/>\n  want to see Sammy, (or any of us).<br/>\n  I wrote this here because this is the most peaceful and wise list I <br/>\n  know of.  I want to express my thanks and remind the people who have <br/>\n  selflessly given of their time and wisdom over the years just how<br/>\n  important they are.  You changed my life and you helped to make Sams <br/>\n  life so worthwhile and meaningful and full of joy.<br/>\n  I wrote this without crying, and am not looking for condolences.<br/>\n  Just giving thanks and maybe creating some discussion of how lucky we <br/>\n  all are to unschool.

My SIL and I<br/>\n&gt; started out with the same parenting beliefs<br/>\n&gt; (fam bed, BF...) in fact,<br/>\n&gt; she influenced me a lot.  Ordered me<br/>\n&gt; Mothering, told me about LLL.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, over the years, we have gone in<br/>\n&gt; different directions, but<br/>\n&gt; have remained good friends, though our busy<br/>\n&gt; separate lives, keep us<br/>\n&gt; from seeing each other very much.<br/>\n&gt; Their family dynamics are pretty different<br/>\n&gt; from ours. My niece is in<br/>\n&gt; 7th grade and is going through all that<br/>\n&gt; stuff(crap) that goes on<br/>\n&gt; socially for kids in school.  She has been<br/>\n&gt; dealing with lots of<br/>\n&gt; school/social stuff for years, but they<br/>\n&gt; think it&#39;s all normal, and<br/>\n&gt; necessary for a healthy<br/>\n&gt; upbringing..yada,yada...  My niece just<br/>\n&gt; made<br/>\n&gt; the honor role.  She excels academically.<br/>\n&gt; I have a good relationship with my niece.<br/>\n&gt; I like her a lot, and we<br/>\n&gt; get along well.  We talk a lot, and joke<br/>\n&gt; around a lot.  She comes<br/>\n&gt; over just to hang out and play with my<br/>\n&gt; little ones.  But we&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; one issue that keeps coming between us.  My<br/>\n&gt; mother!  My mom and I<br/>\n&gt; have gotten really close over the past 5<br/>\n&gt; years or so.  She stopped<br/>\n&gt; working, I started homeschooling and we<br/>\n&gt; have been able to get<br/>\n&gt; together quite a bit because of this.  My<br/>\n&gt; mom lives in FL(I live in<br/>\n&gt; MD), so I visit every winter, sometimes<br/>\n&gt; twice(this year, it looks<br/>\n&gt; like 3 times.  She comes up and spends the<br/>\n&gt; summer in our resort town<br/>\n&gt; in her own apt. and we spend most days at<br/>\n&gt; the beach with her.  My<br/>\n&gt; children adore her, and so do I really.  My<br/>\n&gt; niece has a lot of<br/>\n&gt; problems with all the time we get to spend<br/>\n&gt; with her, and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; She has made it clear over the years that<br/>\n&gt; we have infringed on her<br/>\n&gt; private Grandmom time.  We&#39;ll come to the<br/>\n&gt; beach one day, and she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; roll her eyes at the fact that we are<br/>\n&gt; there.  She complains loudly<br/>\n&gt; about the fact that we always get to go to<br/>\n&gt; FL and visit.  My mom<br/>\n&gt; tries to make special times with just her,<br/>\n&gt; but has come to feel that<br/>\n&gt; my niece can be a little obnoxious about<br/>\n&gt; the way she expresses her<br/>\n&gt; rights to have her to herself, orto  have<br/>\n&gt; equal time.  So every time<br/>\n&gt; my kids get to see her,  my mother is<br/>\n&gt; suppose to make sure my niece<br/>\n&gt; gets as many times spent with her too.<br/>\n&gt; I can understand this, coming from the mind<br/>\n&gt; of a 12 year old, but my<br/>\n&gt; SIL seems to encourage this behavior.  She<br/>\n&gt; makes comments to me about<br/>\n&gt; my nieces feelings, and how much time we<br/>\n&gt; get to spend with my mom.<br/>\n&gt; She seems to be implying I should purposely<br/>\n&gt; spend less time with my<br/>\n&gt; mom to make it fair for her daughter.<br/>\n&gt; My first thoughts to these incedents are,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;tough!&quot;.  We chose to have<br/>\n&gt; a free lifestyle,  my mother encourages us<br/>\n&gt; to come, and invites us to<br/>\n&gt; do things, and loves being with my kids,<br/>\n&gt; and has always made that<br/>\n&gt; clear, why should I change anything!?<br/>\n&gt; Boy this is getting long.<br/>\n&gt; Well the latest is, my mom suggested we<br/>\n&gt; come for Easter this year.<br/>\n&gt; My 11yo dd said she wanted to have Easter<br/>\n&gt; at our house, so we said we<br/>\n&gt; would come a different time.  Then we found<br/>\n&gt; out my dh was going to be<br/>\n&gt; away for Easter, and my dd siad that going<br/>\n&gt; to FL would be better than<br/>\n&gt; being here without dad.  My mother was here<br/>\n&gt; for a funeral, and I had<br/>\n&gt; taken my dd and my niece to the funeral 1<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 hrs away and met my<br/>\n&gt; mother there.  The girls drove back with<br/>\n&gt; her, and my niece made plans<br/>\n&gt; to come to FL over Easter for her spring<br/>\n&gt; break.  She wanted my dd to<br/>\n&gt; come too, but my dd didn&#39;t want to.  So a<br/>\n&gt; few days after this, we<br/>\n&gt; deide that going for Easter would be fun,<br/>\n&gt; and I didn&#39;t realize my<br/>\n&gt; niece was planning on going(niether did my<br/>\n&gt; mother, because they had<br/>\n&gt; had the one conversation, and she hadn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; heard from her or my SIL<br/>\n&gt; again about it.  So when I called to say,<br/>\n&gt; that we changed our minds<br/>\n&gt; and would be coming, she was very happy.<br/>\n&gt; Then last night my SIL<br/>\n&gt; called and when I told her we were going<br/>\n&gt; for Easter, she told my<br/>\n&gt; niece, and my niece stormed off into her<br/>\n&gt; room, apparently devistated<br/>\n&gt; by the fact that we all would bbe there<br/>\n&gt; too, and that would RUIN her<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; My SIL was telling me all of this, and I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say.  I<br/>\n&gt; was kind of ticked and thought she was<br/>\n&gt; being rude to imply that maybe<br/>\n&gt; we should change our plans now.  I have 4<br/>\n&gt; kids and we had already<br/>\n&gt; discussed that we would be going for<br/>\n&gt; Easter.  My 11yo was infuriated<br/>\n&gt; that my niece would act like this(once<br/>\n&gt; again) and she was saying that<br/>\n&gt; if we changed our plans for someone who was<br/>\n&gt; being rude and selfish,<br/>\n&gt; that SHE would have a fit to.  Well, she<br/>\n&gt; did.  We spent the entire<br/>\n&gt; evening discussing it, and I decided I<br/>\n&gt; would have no fun being there,<br/>\n&gt; knowing my niece wouldn&#39;t want us there.<br/>\n&gt; My niece called and talked<br/>\n&gt; to my dd, and said she wasn&#39;t going to go<br/>\n&gt; at Easter and would pick<br/>\n&gt; another time to go (my dd thought she was<br/>\n&gt; being a big baby, but I<br/>\n&gt; thought she actually made a good decision,<br/>\n&gt; probably with the help of<br/>\n&gt; her mother)I decided that since we are the<br/>\n&gt; ones that have the<br/>\n&gt; freedom, that we could choose another time<br/>\n&gt; to go, since it was so<br/>\n&gt; important to her, to not have all of us<br/>\n&gt; there.  My dd reluctantly<br/>\n&gt; agreed, with the promise of us getting to<br/>\n&gt; go twice(once when my<br/>\n&gt; parents wouldn&#39;t be there and we would<br/>\n&gt; house sit, then again, after<br/>\n&gt; Easter.  My niece immediately felt bad,<br/>\n&gt; that we changed our plans for<br/>\n&gt; her.  I think my SIL did too.  She told me<br/>\n&gt; that my niece said &quot;now I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to go at all! and started to<br/>\n&gt; cry.<br/>\n&gt; They called this morning with new plans and<br/>\n&gt; we are still working out<br/>\n&gt; the details.  Though we&#39;re still not going<br/>\n&gt; for Easter.<br/>\n&gt; I was a little hurt by my niece, and angry<br/>\n&gt; at my SIL handling of her<br/>\n&gt; daughters attitude about it all, but I bit<br/>\n&gt; the bullet and put on a<br/>\n&gt; happy face and said it was all fine.  And<br/>\n&gt; really it mostly is.  I<br/>\n&gt; feel better.  The behavoir and attitude is<br/>\n&gt; theirs to deal with now,<br/>\n&gt; and it will all work out fine.<br/>\n&gt; I just have a nagging feeling, I have just<br/>\n&gt; justified my nieces<br/>\n&gt; behavior, and I still feel hurt at the fact<br/>\n&gt; that she can so easily<br/>\n&gt; let us know how much she doesn&#39;t want us<br/>\n&gt; around at times.<br/>\n&gt; I can see how having 4 kids around ages 2<br/>\n&gt; to 11 can very much change<br/>\n&gt; the dynamics of any environment, but I<br/>\n&gt; still think it&#39;s rude to<br/>\n&gt; express those feelings.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s pretty much over now, and I am<br/>\n&gt; doing my best to not have<br/>\n&gt; any hard feelings about it all.  They are<br/>\n&gt; still very important to me,<br/>\n&gt; and I guess that is why it hurts a little.<br/>\n&gt; It always makes me feel better to type it<br/>\n&gt; all out.  I usually end up<br/>\n&gt; deleting what I write, because I figure out<br/>\n&gt; my feelings by the end,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m still going to send this one.<br/>\n&gt; Joanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an<br/>\n&gt; email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

LOL)<br/>\nOnce the above (the above was a statement regarding kids that through<br/>\ntantrums to get what they want in stores and the writer&#39;s opinion that it is<br/>\ndue to the parent not being consistant in their responses thereby increasing<br/>\nthe child&#39;s tantrum - totally paraphrased) has become a pattern - how does<br/>\none change it? How does one set the limit yet still maintain respect and teh<br/>\nchild autonomy? I tend to have good days (respecting their wishes, everyone<br/>\ncooperating, watching the hunger/anger/lonely/tired thing, modeling behavior<br/>\nand then all of a sudden I realize that there has been some yelling,<br/>\ndisrespect etc and I&#39;m not sure what got us there.<br/>\nAlso, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) My two<br/>\nyear old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk. Would removing it<br/>\nfrom the house for a period of time help? Might it give him the space to try<br/>\nother healthier foods and realize he likes them?
