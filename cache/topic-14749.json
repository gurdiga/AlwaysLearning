I was given by the school nurse <br/>\na bunch of forms to give to certain kids, who are missing some <br/>\nvacination.  The school nurse highlighted where the parent can sign so <br/>\nthe school can give the vaccination themselves.  Amazing, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that this happened.  THe parents don&#39;t even have to be present, <br/>\nthe school can just get the signature (and some parents truely don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what they are signing) and the kid is called into the nurses office <br/>\nand the nurse gives the vaccine and the kid goes back to class.  There <br/>\nis a very tiny line at the bottom where the parents can sign if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want the child to receive the vaccination but it is really hard to <br/>\nunderstand what they are signing--if you don&#39;t speak English or don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a college education, you might not understand that all you are <br/>\nsigning is that you don&#39;t want your child to get the vaccine.
