I don&#39;t like arguing over what someone<br/>\nthought I meant and I don&#39;t like having errors pointed out ;-) So feedback<br/>\nhas motivated me to learn to hear how what I write could sound to someone<br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is such a lack of thought, of questioning and seeking these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been different. It&#39;s that over a life time we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to meet a whole lot more unthinking people than people of the past did<br/>\njust because there are more people. And, to some extent, in the past people<br/>\ncould stick to rules because the present wasn&#39;t much different from the past<br/>\nwhen the rules were made up so not thinking wasn&#39;t that great of a deal. In<br/>\nfact it was probably better to do as you learned rather than think too hard<br/>\nabout it. What was there to question or seek? You attended the church<br/>\neveryone did, entered the profession your father had, married the person<br/>\nyour parents thought best. Not only wasn&#39;t there much to think about, it was<br/>\nprobably dangerous to do so!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 175","postDate":"1012501124","msgId":3599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMDIxWUxFSGFvVUQxcktjT0gwMDAwOTQwNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":3583,"nextInTopic":3621,"prevInTime":3598,"nextInTime":3600,"topicId":3583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
