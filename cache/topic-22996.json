We have been enjoying the <br/>\ncartoons now with our dd, especially Invader Zim which she loves, since <br/>\nyou guys set us straight over the weekend.  Well, we went to the bank <br/>\nyesterday and one of the tellers gave her a little notepad.  On the way <br/>\nhome my dd drew amazingly accurate pictures of Zim on several of those <br/>\nlittle notepad sheets!  From memory!!  Over the last 2 days now she has <br/>\ndrawn almost all of the characters from that program, and is loving <br/>\nit.  She also found a cartoon drawing class offered at the library when <br/>\nwe were there last night, and signed up for it.  This might not of <br/>\nhappened had we continued to try to curtail her cartoon interest.  With <br/>\nacceptance, it has opened doors.  :-)   We are amazed!!<br/>\n   I also wanted to add, I told my dh that I had put on the last post <br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t a good idea to write a post when you were extremly <br/>\nfrustrated.  He disagreed and said the only way he was able to get <br/>\nhis &quot;mind shift&quot; was by having people point out to him how such a <br/>\nnegative attitude was affecting his relationship with his dd.  Thanks <br/>\nagain.  This way of life never ceases to amaze me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22995,"nextTopicId":22997}}
