If someone already has, I apologize in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nGnostics - are those in search of spiritual truth via knowledge<br/>\nThe word Gnostic stems from the word Gnosis which is Greek in orgin, but <br/>\nmeans Knowledge.<br/>\nGnosticism was/is a movement calling into question the truth of creation and <br/>\nesoteric knowledge of spiritual truths that were held by ancient Gnostics. It <br/>\nwas pre-christianity and post, as it is still a movement today, just not a <br/>\nwell known movement. Karl Jung was a gnostic.The gamate of Gnostic arguments is <br/>\nnearly as large as all other religious movements. Everything from an evil basis <br/>\nto an omnipotent basis for creation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgnostics would be an opposition to Gnostics. In that, it is the acceptance <br/>\nof the unknown or the unknowable. There is not a search for the knowledge. <br/>\nTherefore, Agnostics would be considered noncommital or undogmatic. Agnosticism <br/>\nwould be the movement of the view that God is unknown and unknowable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstheist deny the existence of God. Atheism being the movement of denial of <br/>\nGod.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who followed Gnosticism for many years and still finds herself <br/>\nswaying that way every now and again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Agnostic","postDate":"1055889028","msgId":15177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWMzMzUyMCQ3NmU3NDc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMy4yNGY4NzRmOS4yYzIwZGNhY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15172,"nextInTopic":15180,"prevInTime":15176,"nextInTime":15178,"topicId":15169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the link.
