The button box on <br/>\nthe table sounds just like &quot;it&quot; (whatever &quot;it&quot; is &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy granny had a button box, in a fruit-cake tin.  The kind with Texas <br/>\npictures on it--a star, a cowboy, the Alamo.  I still see those tins <br/>\nsometimes.  Even when I was older and went to her house I would ask to play <br/>\nwith those.  Partly she didn&#39;t have much to do.  Partly it was fun to see <br/>\nwhich ones I remembered, and to look at them with more experience.  At first, <br/>\nwhen I was little, I could only tell the big ones from the little ones, and <br/>\nsort by color or number of holes.  And there used to be the BIG coat buttons <br/>\nfrom the 1930s and 40&#39;s.  As I got older, they got older and more &quot;antique.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd as I got older I could tell that some of those buttons were older than my <br/>\ngrandmother.  Nothing special in there, just the collection of her life, and <br/>\nshe hardly ever sewed anything but quilts, and she crocheted.  Most of the <br/>\ndresses and aprons she made just tied.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had ever thought to put the out and talk about them, but they were <br/>\nprivate with me, and she would have told me to get them off the table, <br/>\nprobably, anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey talked over quilting, she and the older female relatives.

I feel other <br/>\npeoples confusion or discomfort when they mistake him.  <br/>\nI offered him a hair cut on a weekly basis for quite while.  I&#39;m just <br/>\nnow getting to the point that I am really comfortable with it, and <br/>\nactually like it!<br/>\nI had a friend of mine&#39;s husband tease about taking him to get a hair <br/>\ncut the other day.  I just jokingly replied &quot;goodluck!&quot;.   He went on <br/>\nto question me about just who was it that wanted his hair long and <br/>\nwhen I said it was completely him, with maybe a little help from his <br/>\ndad who also has long hair, he was totally baffled.  He actually <br/>\nsaid, &quot;he&#39;s 5!  No kid at 5 years old should have any say about <br/>\nanything in their life.  The parents should decide what they wear, <br/>\nwhat they eat, and definitely how they wear their hair.&quot;  All I could <br/>\nsay was &quot;I wholeheartedly disagree.&quot;<br/>\nHe got even more baffled and asked if when he is 14 would i let him <br/>\nsmoke because  &quot;that&#39;s what he wants to do&quot;? (said in a mocking tone)<br/>\nAt that point I realized I was arguing with a moron and pretty much <br/>\njust said &quot;you&#39;re<br/>\ntalking health issues against basic appearance choices&quot;<br/>\nIt went a little further and I just basically laughed at his <br/>\nassertions and made counter points that he had no reply to.  I now am <br/>\nTOTALLY for my son and his individualness.  I realized the people I <br/>\nwas worried about offending(or whatever it was I was hungup about)<br/>\nwere people like him!<br/>\nIf he ever does decide to go short again Iwill so much miss the kid <br/>\nwho is so cool as to go against the norm.  I will look at pictures <br/>\nand long for the time that I was such a cool mom as to &quot;let&quot; him be <br/>\nwho he wants to be.
