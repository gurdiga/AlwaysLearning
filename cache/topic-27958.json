There are tools that we can use to<br/>\ndispel fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah there is a theme permeating many of your questioning posts which is<br/>\nthat you seem to want to hear about failures. You are not the first person<br/>\nto come to the lists and want essentially statistics, or want to focus on<br/>\nthe problems to be overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis idea that a certain proportion must fail (so how do we avoid being in<br/>\nthat number) is SCHOOLTHINK! It is an assumption based on the experience of<br/>\nbeing schooled and living with schooling because in school a certain<br/>\nproportion of children do fail. They must fail because that is how the bell<br/>\ncurve works. And if too many of them are failing by the school&#39;s criteria,<br/>\nthey change the criteria to keep the bell curve even.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are parents who don&#39;t Unschool successfully and insist their children<br/>\ngo back into school. There are also people who &quot;try an unschooling approach&quot;<br/>\nfor certain topics or subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese people aren&#39;t getting to Unschooling. They are putting their feet in<br/>\nthe water and calling it swimming. Then they wonder why they aren&#39;t reaching<br/>\nthe opposite side of the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who continue to post on this and the sister lists are people who<br/>\nare swimming. This list is populated with success. <br/>\n<br/>\nTools for dispelling fear:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne that has worked well for me is to examine the fear. Is it rational or<br/>\nirrational? Is it some unexamined clich√©d statement put in my head by my own<br/>\nnutty mother or a pat phrase from the media? Does my observation of my child<br/>\nor other people&#39;s children bear out the fear?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother is knowledge. This is a really useful one. Research the real<br/>\nstatistics. Look at the real experiences of people who are Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nStay in the present. Look at what your child is doing today, instead of<br/>\nworrying about the future, which will come anyway. What if some horrible<br/>\nevent took your daughter from you? Would you be regretting the math test she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take next week?<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on success. Focus on the positive outcomes. Learn what people are<br/>\ndoing right, instead of seeking out what they may be doing badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Kowalski has a column in each issue of Life Learning magazine<br/>\n(www.lifelearningmagazine.com ) where he interviews grown up Unschoolers<br/>\nabout their lives and where they are now. By and large they are very<br/>\npositive. I suspect that in the interest of being fair and balanced he asks<br/>\nthem a question along the lines of &quot;negative experiences from Unschooling&quot;<br/>\nor things not learned that were subsequently a problem. Much of the time<br/>\nthese young adults do have some issue or skill that they didn&#39;t learn while<br/>\nunschooling that they found they needed for their profession. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do they do about it? They identify the problem and set about finding<br/>\nthe information, learning the skill or working around the lack - hugely<br/>\nsuccessfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they don&#39;t do is throw their hands up and say, &quot;Gosh Unschooling has<br/>\nmade me failure, I must be stupid, learning new things is hard&quot; or any of<br/>\nthe sad, discouraged mental tapes that go through the minds of schooled kids<br/>\nwho feel like they are failures, or have had their personal interests<br/>\nbelittled and dreams squashed by well meaning but unsupportive conventional<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only regret that people express about Unschooling is that they waited to<br/>\nbegin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool will always be there. If for your family Unschooling does not lead to<br/>\na happier, more connected family with freedom and joy abounding, school will<br/>\nstill be available. But don&#39;t count on it - don&#39;t live with the idea that<br/>\nshe has to keep up just in case, or you will be foiling the process before<br/>\nit starts. The longer your dd is in school, the longer she will need to<br/>\ndeschool. (Approx. 1 month per school year). Every time you say something<br/>\nlike &quot;Why don&#39;t you do this math page&quot; or &quot;Tell me about this book&quot; (with<br/>\nthe intention of gauging her reading competence) or &quot;No more tv today, do<br/>\nsomething worthwhile&quot; it is like Snakes and Ladders - back you go to the<br/>\nbeginning of deschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t fail at Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Thats what they need to do to survive.  I decided to school Jonah because his teacher was abusing him and humiliating him.  Julia (7) however was doing beautifully in school.  I took her out because I trusted my gut.  She is always so touchy feely and clingy all evening and night.  So much so that I found myself always removing her arm from my chest and from around my neck (I breastfed each of them for 2.5 years).  I realized that she was just not getting enough of me.  I never had time to do homework with her, the older kids came first with their hours of work.  She also said that she missed me when she was at school.  Of course my entire family  are shocked, flabbergasted, appaled and can&#39;t understand why i took my kids out. h They have been warning me that I made a huge mistake.  Fortunately I have done attachment parenting before i knew what it was - i listened to my kids.  If they wanted me -<br/>\n they had me.  If they had to be in arms - even when my eldest was 3 - she was in arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen to your kids.

She was so<br/>\ntiny and breathed so quietly that even sleeping next to her we couldn&#39;t<br/>\nalways hear her, so we would put a hand on her to feel the movement as<br/>\ngently as possible to not disturb her. Eventually she grew bigger and older<br/>\nand we were able to let go of our anxiety and trust that she was breathing<br/>\nand get on with just appreciating how beautiful she was.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the need to<br/>\ncheck that your child is learning, so try to do it without disturbing her.<br/>\nEventually - or probably quickly - it will become abundantly clear that she<br/>\nis learning and you can let go of that checking, and just appreciate her<br/>\nwonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started saying something about long term investments paying off, but James<br/>\ncalled me on that idea, saying that looking at it in terms of payoffs isn&#39;t<br/>\nhelpful.

She is<br/>\nin 7th grade and struggling in math. She likes animals, bugs, and watching<br/>\nmovies. When she tested below grade level in English, I told her if she were<br/>\nto watch her DVD&#39;s, she had to have the English subtitles on. She came up to<br/>\ngrade level last year in English. She still struggles in math.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one unschool a reluctant learner? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Most of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible<br/>\nbefore they were done.&quot; -- Louis D.
