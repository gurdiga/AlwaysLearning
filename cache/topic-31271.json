Loaded with one-liners, cartoons, and even a limerick or two this book covers such topics as Logic (&quot;Sherlock Holmes never deduced anything!&quot;); Existentialism (&quot;You haven&#39;t lived until you think about death all the time.&quot;); Ethics (How The Sopranos contributed to the Golden Rule?) and much more.<br/>\n&quot;The construction and payoff of jokes and the construction and payoff of philosophical concepts are made of the same stuff,&quot; the authors contend. &quot;They tease the mind in similar ways. That&#39;s because philosophy and jokes proceed from the same impulse: to confound out sense of the way things are, to flip our worlds upside down, and to ferret out hidden, often uncomfortable, truths about life. What the philosopher calls an insight, the gagster calls a zinger.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
