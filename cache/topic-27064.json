Maybe part of her anxiety is the fact that she doesn&#39;t know whats best for her-school or homeschool because thats something that she seems to have control over. I think you as her parent should take all that stress off of her and make the decision....if you want to homeschool, tell her thats what your both going to do. Maybe that would make her feel much more secure to know that she doesnt HAVE to have that stress. Homework is a b***h and if it gets too frustrating, she should stop. The fact that she could get kicked out of the program makes it clearer to me that she should be home to go at her own pace.
