So the way I read Joyce&#39;s comment, a parent should be the &quot;armor,&quot; in the sense that armor is meant to be articulated, flexible, mobile, and customized, rather than be a pen or a cage that is inert and immovable. If your armor is perfect, you shouldn&#39;t even notice it-it will protect you while giving you full range of motion. A wall, on the other hand, you can crash into and it won&#39;t move. <blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1344796623gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\"><div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><div><br></div><div>Is that close to the intention?</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div>\n </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Really read, really think","postDate":"1474542181","msgId":77517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGMTAwODkxLTVGNzUtNENEOC05M0ZDLTI1MkM3MDE1ODhFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77518,"prevInTime":77516,"nextInTime":77518,"topicId":77517,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joyce wrote something in another topic that’s worth looking at just all by itself for the writing and phrasing and for the type of thinking it takes in the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-545991844\">Joyce wrote something in another topic that’s worth looking at just all by itself for the writing and phrasing and for the type of thinking it takes in the reader to parse this—to read it looking for the meaning of each word and phrase.
