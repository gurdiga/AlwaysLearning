I used to go outside with no shoes on ALL the time as a kid and I <br/>\nmiss that freedom.  In my own home I still like going barefoot inside <br/>\nand occasionally I go outside without shoes.  Shoes are like seatbelts <br/>\nfor some people and status symbols for MANY people.  If you don&#39;t wear <br/>\nthem, some will see a safety hazard at every step, even though safety <br/>\nis relative in different kinds of shoes.  Some are harder to cut off if <br/>\nyou get injured (if you break a bone, swelling after being stung by <br/>\nbees or something) and having slip-on shoes would better.  I prefer <br/>\nsome shoes because I can feel where I&#39;m walking with them and my <br/>\nbalance is better when I can feel more.  Some shoes that I can feel the <br/>\nground with are too flimsy for my liking.  So I do prefer going <br/>\nbarefoot.  But I usually wear slip-ons in the house and out.  Go <br/>\nfigure.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing shoeless is healthier for airing out feet, which might keep down <br/>\non fungal problems for people with sweaty feet.  Some people wear shoes <br/>\nfrom the time they get out of bed to the time they lie down.  (Ugh.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the tradition of taking off shoes indoors, carpet or not.  The <br/>\nfloors do stay much cleaner and that&#39;s less hassle right there.  Many <br/>\nAmericans that I know have taken up the habit.

I thought he needed the kind words, not me for being mean. But how would I have felt if someone spoke directly to him? how would he have felt? These are just things I was pondering. <br/>\n<br/>\nJenny <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n           <br/>\n  <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n              <br/>\n          <br/>\n            Messages in this topic           (6)<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n          <br/>\n            Reply           (via web post)<br/>\n          | <br/>\n        <br/>\n          Start a new topic        <br/>\n           <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n                Messages  <br/>\n            |    Files  <br/>\n            |    Photos  <br/>\n            |    Links  <br/>\n            |    Database  <br/>\n        <br/>\n            |    Members  <br/>\n            |    Calendar  <br/>\n      <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n                <br/>\n                  <br/>\n      MARKETPLACE<br/>\n      <br/>\n                  <br/>\n            I Got Fired But now make $350/day online!.          <br/>\n                          <br/>\n                          <br/>\n                        I&#39;m happy I lost my Job.

This is what I said: <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMike, <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to clear something up. There have been at least three times now that you have mentioned that one of my kids was barefoot. Once when I was walking back from the mailbox you said it was crazy that Evan was not wearing shoes; so I said that &quot;I figure they can be barefoot if they want to.&quot; Then another time, Colby was out front playing and you asked him in an exaggerated voice, &quot;Where are your shoes?&quot; Then tonight, Owen mentioned that when Evan came to your driveway you said, &quot;Stop, nobody can come over without shoes on,&quot; (or something like that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things:<br/>\n1. We realize that you wanted Evan to keep his distance because of fear of flu (which my kids don&#39;t have by the way.) So we feel like it would have given Evan much more accurate information if you could have just honestly said to him, &quot;Oh hey, stop. Don&#39;t come over here today. We&#39;re afraid of the flu that the neighbor has.&quot; Instead, he thought you really meant what you said about shoes, came home to put his shoes on, and started to go back over, apparently.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Our children choose to put on their shoes, and any other clothing, when they want to. They go barefoot when they want to. They are in control of their own bodies. Owen and I feel very strongly about this. We would appreciate it if you could try to be more aware of what you say to the kids that could undermine their choices or freedoms. Please be aware that your perception of hazards, or what children &quot;should&quot; do, may be different than ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not mad about this, by the way. I only chose to put this in an email because I am better at expressing myself in writing than I am in person. In addition, we decided we should definitely tell you how we felt about these things, because how could you possibly know how we feel if we didn&#39;t tell you?<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nJenny <br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHe responded politely that it was well noted and appreciated, thank you.

So, I wrote to my friend Amy about it and included our brief email discussion below your words. I&#39;m also looking for other people&#39;s contributions to this discussion, as I am trying to learn how to speak up for myself, my kids, and other kids who may need help. Sometimes I can&#39;t decide when and if it is my place to do so.<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWhen I told my neighbor to be nicer to his kids he said to mind my own<br/>\nbusiness. I said if he would keep his noise out of my yard that would<br/>\nbe fine, but if he was going to yell and disturb my peace too, it was<br/>\nmy business, and if his kids were going to keep being mean to mine<br/>\nbecause he was mean to his, that was my business. It wasn&#39;t said that<br/>\nsmoothly or all at once, because he would insult me (in front of his<br/>\nwife and kids) and then I would respond. I didn&#39;t go to his house to<br/>\nsay anything. He was berating his young boys (now teens) about kite<br/>\nflying, in the vacant lot behind both our houses, and I was passing by<br/>\nto go and rent a video. I passed by and said softly to him &quot;You<br/>\nshould be nicer to them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it was &quot;not nice&quot; for me to say that, but it also resulted in<br/>\nthem being quieter, and apparently of him being nicer to them. I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t fighting a fight, I was expressing a sorrow for those children<br/>\nthat had built up over a couple of years, spiced with reports from<br/>\nHolly and Marty of random meanness the boys had expressed to them just<br/>\nfor passing by, and meanness at the park near our houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat people do privately is in a different category from what&#39;s done<br/>\npublicly. So I know that having a list like this, having a big-mouth<br/>\nblog, having a website, makes me a target. Defending unschooling<br/>\nmakes me a target. But I&#39;m expressing what has built up in me about<br/>\nchildren and parenting over many years. Nobody has to hear it (read<br/>\nit), because I&#39;m not pushing it. People come here.  <br/>\n_______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy, I&#39;m quoting this above from Sandra Dodd because it makes me think of when my neighbor across the street is mean (in my opinion) to his 3.5 year old son. For example, there are times when he knows all his son wants to do is play in their van, but he (the dad) wants to go in the house because &quot;it is time for...&quot; so the dad locks the van and leaves the son standing, screaming in the driveway. Screaming so earnestly that I think he is hurt. I&#39;ve looked over there with concern and started to put my shoes on, contemplating going over to comfort the boy. Then the dad comes out, standing on his porch with his hands on his hips with the look of, &quot;I&#39;ve got this under control.&quot; Then I get too intimidated to say anything to him or his son. Even when my other next door neighbor, calls out jokingly, &quot;Child abuse&quot; with a chuckle, I still chose to just whisper to my kids, &quot;that&#39;s too bad&quot; because they&#39;re standing in our yard watching their friend cry.<br/>\n-Jenny V.<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy replied:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at the zoo last summer and this guy was yelling at his older daughter when the younger daughter and their mom walked away.  He was screaming in her face, it was disgusting.  I couldn&#39;t eat my lunch, I lost my appetite.  Jeff got up and said to him, &quot;don&#39;t talk to your daughter like that!&quot;  And the guy said, &quot;Mind your own f&#39;ing business!&quot;  Jeff said, &quot;It is my business when my kids can hear you bullying your daughter, everyone can hear you!&quot;  Jeff got right in his face, I grabbed him and said we should go...stuff like that scares me a little.  Most people react with hate when people try to mention how they should treat their kids and living in W. PA most people think spankings and time outs are just a part of parenting.  I can&#39;t even read my local mom&#39;s board anymore, it was causing me to have too many negative feelings.  I agree with Sandra Dodd, if we can hear it the issue becomes our business.
