I recall even Sandra saying (not to put words in <br/>\nanyone&#39;s mouth and forgive me if I am somehow remembering wrong) at <br/>\nsome time in the past on this list that if she had such requirements <br/>\nit might be harder to stay in a purely unschooling mindset inside <br/>\nherself.

Not being registered till this year was <br/>\nbetter, but I didn&#39;t think it was possible in our situation to sail <br/>\nunder the radar anymore and I didn&#39;t want to have legal troubles.  <br/>\nOn the other hand, I have often heard that in some cases it is <br/>\nbetter to ask for forgiveness than for permission and perhaps this <br/>\nis one of those situations and I should not have let my resolve <br/>\nwaver enough to register but just kept sailing along happily <br/>\nunschooling under the radar.

Maybe I<br/>\nshould have put a lawyer on retainer just to get them<br/>\nto answer that question realistically for me, but that<br/>\nseemed a bit extreme.  Also since we&#39;re in such a very<br/>\nrural area we can&#39;t just be invisible in the crowd,<br/>\ntrusting our anonymity to protect us.  Our school<br/>\ndistrict rep knows by name, face and family<br/>\nassociations who is homeschooling, so not registering<br/>\nmeans we could never get involved in local activities<br/>\nwhich might involve the school or be at the school or<br/>\nthat we&#39;d have to lie about being registered, and all<br/>\nsorts of other sticky possibilities (the one k-12<br/>\nschool is a hub of local activity whether it&#39;s<br/>\nofficially school related or not at all.)

I would love to see what Mary Ellen has<br/>\nshared if she doesn&#39;t mind. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   We  live  if Florida which requires a year-end evaluation. I<br/>\nhave  been  very,  very  careful to choose an evaluator that is<br/>\nextremely  child-friendly.  She  does not unschool but she does<br/>\nhomeschool and is very accepting of different views. Of course,<br/>\nit helps that my boys are scoring extremely well each year. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   My  youngest  has  always been homeschooled and the last few<br/>\nyears  we  have  been leaning more and more to unschooling from<br/>\nnecessity  since  I  have  been a single mom with two jobs. The<br/>\nlonger we do child-led learning the more Daniel shows me that I<br/>\nshould  trust  him  to  know what he needs to learn. I love his<br/>\ncuriosity!<br/>\n<br/>\n   This  week  we  did  his  yearly  evaluation   which  is  an<br/>\nindividual  test  that  is  done  in  part verbally and in part<br/>\nwritten with the evaluator. I am able to sit next to Daniel and<br/>\nobserve  everything  that he does so that I can see where he is<br/>\nstrong in his abilities and where he is still learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n   There  were  several  problems that he knew how to do but he<br/>\nmissed  them  because  he  was  not  familiar  with the way the<br/>\nquestion  was asked. However, our evaluator was very good about<br/>\ngoing  back  after  each segment of questions and answering any<br/>\nquestions that Daniel had so that the evaluation ended up being<br/>\nan  awesome  learning experience for all of us. Daniel told the<br/>\nevaluator  how he figured all the math in his head. Some of the<br/>\nproblems  were  difficult  for  the  evaluator  and me to do on<br/>\npaper. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n   Last  year he scored well enough to go from 1st to 3rd grade<br/>\nso   this  year  I  had  prepared  all  of  us  for  a  smaller<br/>\nimprovement.  However, Daniel blew us all away with another big<br/>\njump.  His  reading  is  on  an  8th  grade  level and math and<br/>\nspelling  on  a 6th grade level. He asked if he could be in 5th<br/>\ngrade  and when I asked him why he needed to have a grade level<br/>\nhe said it was because people asked him all the time what grade<br/>\nhe is in. We will be having a discussion about grade levels and<br/>\nwhat  they  are  used  for.  :-)  Definately  not useful in our<br/>\nhomeschool  because we school year-round and just keep learning<br/>\neveryday.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The other requirements for Florida are a portfolio and a list<br/>\nof  books  that  are read and/or used for educational purposes.<br/>\nThe  list  is  easy  enough, we just write down all the info of<br/>\neach book we read or use to learn about our interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The  portfolio  is  a little harder but I have the philosphy<br/>\nthat  as  a  former  private and public school teacher, I never<br/>\nkept  everything  that  each  child  in my classroom did so why<br/>\nshould I keep everything my own child does.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I  just choose projects that give an overall view of what we<br/>\ndo.  Like today, we were on the city bus and Daniel was reading<br/>\nthe  book,  Eldest,  so  I  took a picture of him to add to his<br/>\nportfolio which is becoming more and more like a scrapbook. :-)<br/>\nIt   contains  pictures  of  Daniel  participating  at  library<br/>\nbookclubs,  digging  in the sand and exploring tidepools at the<br/>\nbeach,  visiting  the  aquarium and zoo, taking science classes<br/>\nwith  his friends, cooking with his brother, measuring the wall<br/>\nto  see  if it is long enough for his piano to be moved against<br/>\nit,  learning fencing moves because he loves the swordfights in<br/>\nhis latest book that he is reading, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Everything  we do on any given day is a learning experience.<br/>\nWe recently went to see a full-size replica of the Nina, one of<br/>\nthe  boats  that  Christopher  Columbus  sailed.  What a way to<br/>\nexplore  some  history hands-on! We were able to board the ship<br/>\nand explore everything. It was awesome and made for a wonderful<br/>\nphoto op for the portfolio.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I  hope  this helps you a little but since I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nyour  requirements  are,  it  may  not.  :-)  I  think the most<br/>\nimportant  thing  is  to  be  positive  about all your child is<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n   My  favorite  thought  is:  I  KNOW that Daniel is getting a<br/>\nbetter  education than he would be getting in the school system<br/>\nso... if anyone questions me about what is appropriate and what<br/>\nisn&#39;t  for  his  education, I turn the tables and ask them some<br/>\nreally  tough  questions  about  what the school system offers.<br/>\nWhat would he be getting in the school system that would be any<br/>\nbetter?  Can  they  guarantee  me that my child would be better<br/>\ntreated  or  better repected as a person? Can they guarantee me<br/>\nthat  he  will  learn  more  than  he is right now?? I KNOW the<br/>\nanswer  would  be  a  resounding &quot;no!&quot; so I feel very confident<br/>\nthat  Daniel  and  I  are  meeting  our  obligations  where his<br/>\neducation is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry this was so long. :-) Have a good weekend.

I would love to see what Mary Ellen has shared if she doesn&#39;t mind. :-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We live if Florida which requires a year-end evaluation. I have been very, very careful to choose an evaluator that is extremely child-friendly. She does not unschool but she does homeschool and is very accepting of different views. Of course, it helps that my boys are scoring extremely well each year. :-) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My youngest has always been homeschooled and the last few years we have been leaning more and more to unschooling from necessity since I have been a single mom with two jobs. The longer we do child-led learning the more Daniel shows me that I should trust him to know what he needs to learn. I love his curiosity!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This week we did his yearly evaluation  which is an individual test that is done in part verbally and in part written with the evaluator. I am able to sit next to Daniel and observe everything that he does so that I can see where he is strong in his abilities and where he is still learning. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There were several problems that he knew how to do but he missed them because he was not familiar with the way the question was asked. However, our evaluator was very good about going back after each segment of questions and answering any questions that Daniel had so that the evaluation ended up being an awesome learning experience for all of us. Daniel told the evaluator how he figured all the math in his head. Some of the problems were difficult for the evaluator and me to do on paper. LOL<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Last year he scored well enough to go from 1st to 3rd grade so this year I had prepared all of us for a smaller improvement. However, Daniel blew us all away with another big jump. His reading is on an 8th grade level and math and spelling on a 6th grade level. He asked if he could be in 5th grade and when I asked him why he needed to have a grade level he said it was because people asked him all the time what grade he is in. We will be having a discussion about grade levels and what they are used for. :-) Definately not useful in our homeschool because we school year-round and just keep learning everyday.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The other requirements for Florida are a portfolio and a list of books that are read and/or used for educational purposes. The list is easy enough, we just write down all the info of each book we read or use to learn about our interests. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The portfolio is a little harder but I have the philosphy that as a former private and public school teacher, I never kept everything that each child in my classroom did so why should I keep everything my own child does. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just choose projects that give an overall view of what we do. Like today, we were on the city bus and Daniel was reading the book, Eldest, so I took a picture of him to add to his portfolio which is becoming more and more like a scrapbook. :-) It contains pictures of Daniel participating at library bookclubs, digging in the sand and exploring tidepools at the beach, visiting the aquarium and zoo, taking science classes with his friends, cooking with his brother, measuring the wall to see if it is long enough for his piano to be moved against it, learning fencing moves because he loves the swordfights in his latest book that he is reading, etc. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Everything we do on any given day is a learning experience. We recently went to see a full-size replica of the Nina, one of the boats that Christopher Columbus sailed. What a way to explore some history hands-on! We were able to board the ship and explore everything. It was awesome and made for a wonderful photo op for the portfolio.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope this helps you a little but since I don&#39;t know what your requirements are, it may not. :-) I think the most important thing is to be positive about all your child is doing. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My favorite thought is: I KNOW that Daniel is getting a better education than he would be getting in the school system so... if anyone questions me about what is appropriate and what isn&#39;t for his education, I turn the tables and ask them some really tough questions about what the school system offers. What would he be getting in the school system that would be any better? Can they guarantee me that my child would be better treated or better repected as a person? Can they guarantee me that he will learn more than he is right now?? I KNOW the answer would be a resounding &quot;no!&quot; so I feel very confident that Daniel and I are meeting our obligations where his education is concerned.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sorry this was so long. :-) Have a good weekend.

What I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-272897609\">For those of you who have to comply by state requirements to <br/>\nhomeschool, how do you keep that separate of (even in your mind) <br/>\nunschooling your kids?  What I mean is, if you have to translate <br/>\nthings your kids are doing into Schooly language for state <br/>\nassessments, or if you are required to do portfolios or other such <br/>\nrequirements, how do you keep that from emotionally and <br/>\npsychologically affecting how you think about and view and talk <br/>\nabout learning and unschooling among your family?  Also how do you <br/>\nshield your kids from &quot;interested officials&quot; if it&#39;s necessary for <br/>\nyou or them to interact with them in some way?  How do folks who <br/>\nhave testing requirements in their state deal with those?  Do some <br/>\nof you go under the radar?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked some of this here before, but it&#39;s a continuing problem <br/>\nfor me given the requirements of this state and I&#39;ll be needing to <br/>\ndo out first leagally offical assessment this fall (given that <br/>\nThomas is now over 8 yrs, our compulsory age in WA) and I want to <br/>\nnot let this affect how they interact with the world and go about <br/>\nlearning things, nor how I am able to think about it myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to keep a small notebook journal of what they are <br/>\ndoing and label it with different &quot;subject&quot; headings so that I can <br/>\nremember all they did when I have to write out a year end <br/>\nassessment.  But it&#39;s hard to pull my head out of whatever fun thing <br/>\nthey or we are doing and translate that into schoolish language at <br/>\nany given moment, even without them knowning anyting about what I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing.  I tend to forget to do it, which I think is an unconsiously <br/>\ndefensive &quot;forgetting&quot; because it doesn&#39;t feel nice to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen, I saved the information you had sent me previously about <br/>\nyour assessments and intend to use that as a model this fall, so <br/>\nthanks again for that information.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24070,"nextTopicId":24155}}
