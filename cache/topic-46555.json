You and your <br/>\ndaughter only or do you have boarders you&#39;ve committed to feeding or <br/>\nsomething like that?  It is terrifically helpful to catch yourself <br/>\nsaying &quot;have to&quot; and question that, right then and there. When I had a 2 <br/>\nyear old, breakfast was never something I had to &quot;get started.&quot; We&#39;d <br/>\nscrounge up a bowl of cereal and some fruit or make some toast and <br/>\npeanut butter WHEN we were hungry (when I saw the signs of hunger) or <br/>\nwhen it was convenient. Honestly, I&#39;d probably have stayed and played <br/>\nfor as long as my daughter wanted, if it was a sweet and happy game. <br/>\nSavor those times - I know she&#39;s only 2, but time will go quickly.

You&#39;ve got your <br/>\npriorities a little skewed. Ask yourself &quot;why&quot; about each of those <br/>\nthings you think you need to move on to. Especially ask, &quot;Why now?&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I rolled out of it by asking her if she wanted to crack the eggs, which I then wondered if was a form of coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Holy cow - seriously? You offered her a fun thing to do and she <br/>\naccepted. So - I suggest you get the word coercion out of your <br/>\nvocabulary - you are in NO danger of coercing your child. Far from it. <br/>\nStop worrying about it. Maybe just think about being nice and kind and <br/>\ngentle and supportive.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is the kind of situation I wonder about.

Parents are supposed <br/>\nto be kind, but firm?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something about your questions, Dina, that makes me think <br/>\nyou&#39;re complicating things, in your head, that you&#39;ve read a bunch of <br/>\nnoncoercive parenting stuff and maybe some more conventional parenting <br/>\nstuff, plus the unschooling stuff, and all that is interfering with you <br/>\nbeing natural and honest and real with your daughter.

Could you post more about this <br/>\nthought - what things are you thinking about here? I think if we <br/>\nconsider them together, we can loosen up your feelings and help you feel <br/>\nmore free to BE more creative in your daily living with your daughter.  <br/>\nAlso, if you find you&#39;re avoiding things - I have two responses. One - <br/>\nthose are things you don&#39;t want to do so see if you can figure out a way <br/>\nto avoid doing them at all. Put your creativity to work on that. Second <br/>\n- if it is things like housework that you&#39;re avoiding - there is a very <br/>\nvery good chance that you&#39;re making it too high a priority for someone <br/>\nwith a two year old. Do the minimum, enjoy it when you DO have a chance <br/>\nto do it, and consider hiring a mother&#39;s helper. If I had it to do over <br/>\nagain, the one thing that would have made our lives much smoother and <br/>\nhappier would have been to find a teenage girl who wanted to earn a <br/>\nlittle extra money and pay her to come in several days a week for just <br/>\nan hour or two and do some dishes, clean the bathroom, clear up some <br/>\nclutter.  Anyway, when you say, &quot;the more creative I can be, the <br/>\nbetter,&quot; I think you mean the more &quot;fun&quot; you can be with your daughter. <br/>\nThat&#39;s good. Be fun - support her life being fun, as much as you can. <br/>\nRelax. This is going to be SO good for you - you&#39;re a little high-strung <br/>\nand, as you said, perfectionistic, and your daughter is offering you the <br/>\nchance to mellow out and enjoy life more. Take the chance.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sandra, I read in the archives a statement you said to the effect that you wouldn&#39;t let your kids carve into the wooden table.  How do you say the &#39;no, you can&#39;t carve into the wooden table&#39; part?<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You say, &quot;Don&#39;t carve the table. Here, let&#39;s go outside and find some <br/>\nwood you can carve.&quot;  Or, &quot;Don&#39;t carve the table,&quot; and you turn on the <br/>\ntv to a movie she likes. Or, sometimes you don&#39;t even have to say <br/>\nanything - you just distract her from carving the table.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, Thea is sometimes throwing down an object that frustrates her.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s okay. It is normal two-year-old behavior. Frustration is part of <br/>\nlife for two-year-olds and we can be there to help them, but we can&#39;t <br/>\neliminate all frustration - it is built into being unskilled and little <br/>\nand not having enough vocabulary yet to fully express themselves and all <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s throwing things down in frustration,  you might be able to pay <br/>\na little more attention and see the frustration about to build up and <br/>\nhelp her just at the right time to prevent it - but, honestly, don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect yourself to be able to always do that - 2 year olds will be <br/>\nfrustrated.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I&#39;m always sure to let her know that I&#39;m there, that I see how it can be frustrating, etc and help her if she wants it, but when she gets upset, she&#39;ll do that or put her head down on the floor for a while.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not bad, either. She&#39;s got herself a self-soothing mechanism - <br/>\nputting her head down on the floor - maybe think of it as her way of <br/>\ncentering herself - a moment of meditation. Just be there for her - but <br/>\ndon&#39;t TALK so much. Sometimes just a word or two - sometimes not even a <br/>\nword, just a soothing sound or a gentle little bit of a rub on the back <br/>\nis enough for her to know you&#39;re there. SHE knows you will help, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to tell her. Sometimes, when little ones are frustrated, <br/>\nparents add to their frustration by talking at them. It puts even more <br/>\npressure on them because not only they can&#39;t do or handle what they <br/>\nwanted, but often the last thing they want is someone else to do it for <br/>\nthem. That just makes them feel even less capable. Also, they don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe vocabulary to express their complicated feelings and so they get <br/>\neven more frustrated with not being able to think clearly, much less <br/>\nexpress to you, what the problem is.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am wondering if these are normal behaviors that I should just be with or am I and dh creating some kind of distress in the home causing the behavior.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Normal. But you might be making them happen more often than necessary if <br/>\nYOU are very often trying to make her move on to &quot;the next thing&quot; when <br/>\nshe&#39;s not ready. Sounds like you do need to slow down into more of a &quot;Be <br/>\nHere Now&quot; state of mind - not be thinking about the other things you <br/>\n&quot;have to&quot; do.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I know everyone has an outlet, I think.  Part of my problem, which is completely my thing, is in thinking that this wonderful way of raising my daughter is going to help always have things go smoothly and she&#39;ll never have a problem.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This wonderful way of living helps us respond to those not-smooth times <br/>\nwith gentleness and kindness and in helpful ways, rather than shaming or <br/>\nbeing punitive. And, over the years, life will be SO much easier and <br/>\nhappier and smoother. But there will ALWAYS be less-than-wonderful <br/>\nmoments, for various reasons. Right now, she&#39;s two and the reasons have <br/>\nmainly to do with her stage of development and your own development as a <br/>\nmother. But, later, there will be things that aren&#39;t in your control - <br/>\nother kids will be mean to yours, you won&#39;t be able to afford something <br/>\nshe wants, she won&#39;t get a role she auditioned for -- these are <br/>\nrealities of life  - there are disappointments, there are times we&#39;re <br/>\ntired and cranky and hard to get along with. There are times our kids <br/>\nwill be unreasonable and times we will be unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAha - I just had a little realization. Do some of you think that our <br/>\ngoal is to eliminate any possible unhappy moments from our children&#39;s <br/>\nlives? To give them a wrinkle-free childhood? You know the bumper <br/>\nsticker, &quot; Shit Happens,&quot; right? It is how we react to what happens that <br/>\nmatters - are we on their side or do we blame and shame them? We aren&#39;t <br/>\nfailing when things don&#39;t go right; we are failing when we don&#39;t respond <br/>\nhelpfully and supportively when things don&#39;t go right.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   In fact, recently in another post Pam said of her daughters from time to time having some behavior issues that needed to be worked out and that was helpful to hear, for me.

You have just one little one and can put all your focus on <br/>\nher and STILL there are times that her needs and wants conflict with <br/>\nyours, right? So - you try to find ways of meeting each person&#39;s needs <br/>\nand wants, and you get to practice that now while it is pretty <br/>\nstraightforward (she wants to play ball, you want to make breakfast). By <br/>\nthe time she&#39;s older and might have siblings and will almost certainly <br/>\nhave other people in your lives (friends, neighbors, extended family), <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have some experience in working together to balance out <br/>\nconflicting wants and you&#39;ll have created a sense of teamwork and <br/>\nconsensual living with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Roxana lived in France for 3 months, with a large group of other <br/>\nyoung adults - 18 to 20 year olds -  they began to turn to her to help <br/>\nthem sort out conflicts. SHE became known as the person who could find <br/>\nsolutions. She was struck by how little ability the others had to <br/>\nresolve apparent conflicts of interest and, mostly, she was struck by <br/>\nhow unwilling or unable they seemed to be to see a solution as even <br/>\npossible. The irony is that, in our family, she&#39;s the one who has had <br/>\nthe hardest time, over the years, staying solution-oriented, thinking of <br/>\nways to resolve conflicts to everyone&#39;s satisfaction. She&#39;s the one who <br/>\nwas always most likely to give up or get angry (frustrated). She&#39;s easy <br/>\nto get along with, these days. I thought, for some years, that she&#39;d <br/>\nnever be able to live with anyone but us - that nobody else would be <br/>\nwilling to just keep trying to get along with her. She went to a school <br/>\nfor kindergarten and our goal for her, there, was to get through a full <br/>\nday without having a big emotional melt down. But she&#39;s off to college <br/>\nin September and I have no doubt that she&#39;ll be the best roommate on the <br/>\ncampus.

Not nit-picking, just wondering if you were making a diferent point that I don&#39;t understand.  I think that she, at 2, can understand me validating her feeling of frustration even if it&#39;s just through my tone and movement toward her and it to help her. Our home is very kid friendly, but sometimes, for example, when she takes the back off of the remote control to the dvd player which she has access to, because she can and does like to use it if she&#39;s watching a movie, she can&#39;t get it back on.  She will then, sometimes, throw it down.  I could tape it, I guess, but then she knows that it comes off and now I&#39;ve prevented that. <br/>\nShe was throwing a Mrs. Potato Head flower bracelet that didn&#39;t stay on, because it frustrated her. I put it away somewhere.  If she asks for it back, I&#39;ll give it to her, but for now it&#39;s out of sight.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I know everyone has an outlet, I think.-=-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; An outlet such as what?

And I&#39;m wondering if they&#39;re good to have or should I be better able to handle every possibile frustration?  Of course it&#39;s not possible and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s healthy.  But creating circumstances that will limit those potentials, I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also questioning conventional wisdom and am looking to bounce it off of people that I trust.  So if it&#39;s common for &#39;many kids&#39; let&#39;s say, to put they&#39;re heads down when they&#39;re frustrated, well, I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s true or true for conventional parenting practices.  I may be lacking in an area that I need to adjust for her and myself.  Or I&#39;m simply overthinking the whole bit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: too much choice?","postDate":"1248966815","msgId":46563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg0c2RhditwZHFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg0cjFraSthaDNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46562,"nextInTopic":46564,"prevInTime":46562,"nextInTime":46564,"topicId":46555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~How do you say the no, you can t carve into the wooden table part?~~ NO, you can t carve into the wooden table .

It was just what I needed, to put the words out there and really chew on them.  Plus after I hit send on the email, I randomized on Sandra&#39;s site until I got what I needed and my issue of late is mindfulness.  I have not been as present as I should be lately.  It made a world of difference even just today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, we have a lovely, joyful home and life together.  If anything, and part of my recently doubting myself, I am sometimes nudged by dh and my mom if she can get it in there, that I am a bit over the top in accomodating dd.  I think it&#39;s in the &quot;normal&quot; range of this unconventional lifestyle, however.  And dh understands a bit, but I don&#39;t really bother with my mom, though I will at some point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that with Thea reaching this new period, things have become much faster and I have to be much more &quot;on.&quot;  And, I am getting stuck on a few points that perhaps you can make suggestions for, now that I am more clear in my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am looking for is terminology, verbage...this morning, upon waking (we cosleep), we nursed, read, played a bit, I said I wanted to change the sheets right away on Thea&#39;s bed so we had fun doing that together, then we got up and she quickly saw her ball and we recently made up a new game so she wanted to play that in the bedroom a bit more.  We did that.  At some point, I had to get breakfast going.  I gave her a heads up while we were playing that we&#39;d eat soon, so she knew, and after a decent amount of playing time (to me, I guess) I said let&#39;s go in the kitchen.  She didn&#39;t want to.  Here is where I start to internally squirm.  I don&#39;t want her to be upset, but we have to move on to the next thing at some point. I rolled out of it by asking her if she wanted to crack the eggs, which I then wondered if was a form of coercion.  This is the kind of situation I wonder about.  What do you say and how do you be firm? I know the more creative I can be, the better, but sometimes, things have to be a certain way and believe me, often I&#39;ll avoid things if I can, which is where part of the free reign I was speaking of comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I read in the archives a statement you said to the effect that you wouldn&#39;t let your kids carve into the wooden table.

I am wondering if these are normal behaviors that I should just be with or am I and dh creating some kind of distress in the home causing the behavior.  I know everyone has an outlet, I think.  Part of my problem, which is completely my thing, is in thinking that this wonderful way of raising my daughter is going to help always have things go smoothly and she&#39;ll never have a problem.  In fact, recently in another post Pam said of her daughters from time to time having some behavior issues that needed to be worked out and that was helpful to hear, for me. I know I can have perfectionistic ideals, I do my best to be aware of and release them before they get in dd&#39;s way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me stop here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your help.<br/>\nDina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] too much choice?","postDate":"1248884370","msgId":46557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyOTA3OC4xMTg1OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCQTUxN0E3LTNENjEtNDZFQS1BMzhFLTEzNDlEMjM5QkVGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdCQTUxN0E3LTNENjEtNDZFQS1BMzhFLTEzNDlEMjM5QkVGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46556,"nextInTopic":46558,"prevInTime":46556,"nextInTime":46558,"topicId":46555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think I would really need more information to be able to say anything about what is going on in this case.

Telling them NO would have created a battle and a huge melt down.<br/>\nSo I was always prepared with lots of extra clothes in the car. Once they got to the beach they would have gotten hot and removed the coat. I always explained to them that they might feel hot. More and more they would trust me and as they got older they were more likely to , and able, to correlate what I was saying to their experience.<br/>\nJust yesterday at our County Fair my Mother -in-law had some new clothes for my 3 year old Gigi.<br/>\nRight away Gigi wanted to wear the dress she got. It was a fall dress with long sleeves. I told her she might get hot. She still chose to do it and was OK with being hot.( It wasn&#39;t too hot anyways- but hot for ME)<br/>\nSo asking yourself why and taking in consideration  how your child handles certain things.<br/>\nI know my sister&#39;s kids never cared what mom picked up for them to wear, so totally different than my kids.<br/>\nThat is not to say we don&#39;t ever say no.<br/>\nWe have been at the County Fair for the last 3 days ( today will be the last) showing our animals. We bring our food and drinks because the prices are absurd there and we cannot really afford it.<br/>\nWe also cannot afford the rides this year. Really. We are Dairy Farmers and we are running on negative.<br/>\nSo we told the kids when they asked that no we could not do the rides. They wanted to. They do trust us that when we say no it is because we really can&#39;t and there is a good reason.<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if my daughter wears her pretty sandals to the barn. Why not? I got them on a garage sale.<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if my son does not want to wear a jacket to go out in the winter. We take the jacket and warm up the car. Gosh I hate wearing a jacket in the car too. We won&#39;t frezze walking from the house to the car.<br/>\nEven when the temperatures are in the teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt pays to be always prepared , having extra clothes, food and toys in the car, ...<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129999023,"authorName":"John and Amanda Slater","from":"John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt;","profile":"fourslaterz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] too much choice?","postDate":"1248867845","msgId":46556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMDAyOS43NjA5Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCQTUxN0E3LTNENjEtNDZFQS1BMzhFLTEzNDlEMjM5QkVGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46555,"nextInTopic":46557,"prevInTime":46555,"nextInTime":46557,"topicId":46555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At two I think you have lots of control over the environment.  Make the house, at least most of it, so kid friendly she cannot get into much trouble.  Put","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-566598159\">At two I think you have lots of control over the environment.  Make the house, at least most of it, so kid friendly she cannot get into much trouble.  Put markers, scissors, paint, breakables, etc out of her reach and view.  Put away off season clothes so they are not a temptation.  Don&#39;t go places inappropriate for a two year old.  Keep out appropriate snacks so she does not need to go in the cupboards.  Lay down with her at nap and bed time so going to bed is pleasant and looked forward to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can offer without a specific problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nEli 8, Samuel 6 1/2<br/>\n<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"too much choice?","postDate":"1248851422","msgId":46555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCQTUxN0E3LTNENjEtNDZFQS1BMzhFLTEzNDlEMjM5QkVGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46556,"prevInTime":46554,"nextInTime":46556,"topicId":46555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This came by e-mail from someone who s been on two other lists, and it seems maybe another example of bad advice elsewhere, but it could be general confusion","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1433005310\">This came by e-mail from someone who&#39;s been on two other lists, and it  <br/>\nseems maybe another example of bad advice elsewhere, but it could be  <br/>\ngeneral confusion about &quot;say yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think of any links right offhand so I&#39;m hoping people here  <br/>\nwill have suggestions and philosophy and links.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll say again up front that I don&#39;t think blaming unschooling for  <br/>\nproblems with two year olds is any good, as there&#39;s nowhere I know of  <br/>\nwhere two year olds are required by the government to go to school, so  <br/>\nit&#39;s not the unschooling, as Mary Gold says.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is turning 2 on Saturday and I&#39;ve been feeling overwhelmed  <br/>\nlately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty in tune with unschooling and where I&#39;m out of tune. I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen looking on your site and in the archives for help in how to speak  <br/>\nto Thea. I don&#39;t want to be controlling, but in not wanting to be  <br/>\nthat, I feel like I&#39;m allowing too much. I know that doesn&#39;t sound  <br/>\nright. I&#39;m having trouble explaining this even to myself. Pam wrote  <br/>\nrecently, though I can&#39;t find it, some actual phrases she used when  <br/>\nspeaking with her children and they were very direct and clear as to  <br/>\nwhat needed to happen next say or say what was acceptable. I think I  <br/>\nget railroaded sometimes and because I don&#39;t want to control, Thea  <br/>\ngets free reign so to speak or I do find that I am trying to control  <br/>\nand unhappy with it and the results. This is long winded, I  <br/>\napologize.  I think I&#39;m feeling unsure of what I guess would be a  <br/>\ngentle discipline of sorts, what it&#39;s okay to do or say sometimes.  <br/>\nSomething is amiss, I can&#39;t even put my finger on it, hopefully that  <br/>\nmeans I&#39;m nearing some kind of a breakthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m being clear enough, what I was hoping was that you could direct  <br/>\nme to perhaps something on your site or a previous discussion that  <br/>\nwould help, that I am having trouble locating. Or any advice would be  <br/>\nso appreciated or a book, if one comes to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, for starters, I don&#39;t think a two year old should get &quot;free  <br/>\nreign.&quot;  I thing she should be presented with happy choices within the  <br/>\nrange of the day.  Instead of &quot;you can wear anything on earth that you  <br/>\ncan imagine, or nothing at all,&quot; maybe &quot;We&#39;re going to the woods, so  <br/>\npick long pants and close-toed shoes.&quot;  And in the case of a two year  <br/>\nold, that&#39;s more like showing her what you think she should wear, or  <br/>\njust dressing her very happily and taking into consideration if she  <br/>\nwants to reject something, and advising and maybe vetoing her other  <br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nA sparkly bathing suit isn&#39;t good for tree climbing.   A furry hoodie  <br/>\nisn&#39;t good for the beach (unless it&#39;s winter and nobody intends to  <br/>\ntouch water).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a partnership between an adult and a two year old, the two year old  <br/>\ncan be given immense choice without the parent setting aside what she  <br/>\nknows would be helpful and useful and necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46497,"nextTopicId":46437}}
