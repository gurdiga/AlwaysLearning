There was <br/>\na syllabus with very specific details on what you had to do to earn <br/>\neach different grade. It included a specified amount of production of <br/>\nvarious types of work, an essay, attendance at an art show or museum, <br/>\nand a written exam on specific techniques, vocabulary, and supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grade didn&#39;t depend on how the teacher evaluated the art work OTHER <br/>\nthan that she determined if a piece entailed a reasonable attempt to <br/>\nuse a particular technique. This was a course that people could repeat <br/>\nmultiple times and then take intermediate and advanced versions. She <br/>\nwasn&#39;t in a hurry for students to produce great works of art - just <br/>\nfocused on them gaining basic technical skill and understanding of <br/>\ndifferent styles and she supported them in developing enough courage to <br/>\ntake risks and let the art emerge from that. She discussed people&#39;s art <br/>\nwith them - pointed out what she saw that seemed effective and asked <br/>\nthem to evaluate their own work (not give a grade - just talk about it <br/>\n- what were they trying to do, how did that work out, what else might <br/>\nthey try, stuff like that). She was a wonderful teacher with fantastic <br/>\nskill at knowing when to step in and make a suggestion, when to help <br/>\nsomeone with a technique and when to leave them alone to work on it, <br/>\nand was very inspiring and especially incredibly respectful of each <br/>\nperson&#39;s individuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though students register at different levels, all levels were in <br/>\none place at the same time - more advanced students were expected to <br/>\nhelp beginners some of the time. It was a very wonderful alive kind of <br/>\nplace where you could learn your own way - by watching, by trial and <br/>\nerror, by asking questions, by reading about it, watching videos, and <br/>\non and on. She retired and I haven&#39;t had the heart to take another <br/>\nclass because I&#39;d miss her so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Giving Grades","postDate":"1118091261","msgId":22264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjA2MjA1NDIxLjk5Mzg5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMTc4OTQwNDIuMjAzNC40NTA4Lm0xOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22267,"prevInTime":22263,"nextInTime":22265,"topicId":22264,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
