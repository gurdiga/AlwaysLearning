I know two families that do that in NC.  One of the drawbacks I&#39;ve heard mentioned are that the parents have such a big say in WHAT and HOW you teach their children.  With the one family, they tried it for a year, then stopped.  I don&#39;t know why they stopped.  The other family I know has done it for around 8 years now, and they are all happy with the arrangement.  The teacher is certified and uses a very structured curriculum, just like school.  I&#39;m sure unschooling would be a different story.  Jimi Ann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L. Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn L.

I am intrigued with the  <br/>\nidea!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is going to be a question about laws, and not ideal for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think of it is as &quot;enrichment,&quot; but the parents have the  <br/>\nresponsibility for the homeschooling, maybe it could work.  In some  <br/>\nstates it might not matter.  In New Mexico, homeschooling needs to be  <br/>\nthe parents.  It would be better to say you were doing day care and  <br/>\nhave whatever arrangements you want with the parents.   If you have  <br/>\nspecial ed credentials, that would help (in some jurisdictions maybe).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another of those &quot;responsibility&quot; things.   If there is a  <br/>\ncompulsory attendance law, the state has taken responsibility for  <br/>\nproviding education for kids.  If there&#39;s an exception to that law in  <br/>\na certain state or country or province, then what&#39;s happening is  <br/>\nsomeone else is saying &quot;I&#39;ll take responsibility.&quot;   It might not be  <br/>\nlegal for just anyone to take responsibility for someone&#39;s education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother consideration is that unless a child will be with you twenty- <br/>\nfour hours a day so that you created a relationship and an environment  <br/>\nconducive to a full life of learning, what would you provide?  Six or  <br/>\neight hours a day some days a week isn&#39;t the same as unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177170020,"authorName":"Jennie","from":"&quot;Jennie&quot; &lt;jjacob6@...&gt;","profile":"jjacob6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Opinions?","postDate":"1238718044","msgId":43670,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyM2tvcysxMGZxN0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43671,"prevInTime":43669,"nextInTime":43671,"topicId":43670,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Looking for an opinion - I tutor a 5th grade Special Education student twice a week.
