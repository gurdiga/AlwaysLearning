We  <br/>\nprobably agree and I&#39;m quibbling about words, and probably mostly the  <br/>\nword &quot;reading.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent a year being a reading teacher.  I wasn&#39;t specially trained,  <br/>\nbut the first year I taught they put me in as the remedial reading  <br/>\nteacher.  It was legal for one year without me being certified.  The  <br/>\nprincipal told me I  needed to go back and start getting certified.   <br/>\nI said no, I wasn&#39;t going back to school that summer (I was 21 and  <br/>\nhad been in school with summers since I was 14, having taken only one  <br/>\nsummer off the year I turned 18).  I told him I was certified to  <br/>\nteach English and he needed to put me in a language arts position, so  <br/>\nhe did.  Those kids were 12, or should&#39;ve been, but there were  <br/>\nseveral boys in there who turned 14 that year because they had failed  <br/>\nfirst or second grade.  Poor guys!  They were sweet.  They were  <br/>\nhopeful.  They were crushed, though, and had been being told for six  <br/>\nor seven years that they couldn&#39;t read.  They were just resigned to  <br/>\nthat &quot;fact.&quot;  It was criminal.  That was 1975, but  it&#39;s happening  <br/>\nworse than ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wanted to say was that I think unschooled kids read later than  <br/>\nschooled kids in many cases, but our kids are REALLY reading, like  <br/>\npeople, not doing school-tricks so teachers can give them good grades  <br/>\nin reading so schools can meet their test-score quotas, maintain  <br/>\ntheir progress rates and curves and stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile kids at school are being pressed and bullied and bribed to  <br/>\nread, our kids are learning way  more than those kids would be  <br/>\ncapable of reading about, and when unschooled kids learn to read  <br/>\nnaturally they do it filled with peace and a sense of accomplishment  <br/>\nand real purposes in mind.  Reading means they can use YouTube  <br/>\nbetter, and play video games better, and find out which movies are  <br/>\nplaying.  They read like adults (not meaning &quot;at a college level,&quot;  <br/>\nbecause all that is bogus too--it has to do with the lengths of words  <br/>\nand sentences and of the odd way in which tests are calibrated)--they  <br/>\nread in the real world, not in &quot;readers&quot; carefully chosen for  <br/>\nsimplicity, short words, and unnaturally short sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think &quot;the same schedule as schooled kids&quot; is necessarily  <br/>\ntrue, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the deal:   Some kids, school or no school, read at three  <br/>\nand four.  And schools don&#39;t like it one bit.  They criticize the  <br/>\nparents for it, because those kids are trouble in school.  They&#39;re  <br/>\nbored and critical and cause unrest.  But one advantage is they raise  <br/>\nthe average reading level and so there is the appearance that the  <br/>\nschool taught them to read.  Schools and teachers took tons of credit  <br/>\nfor things I learned outside of school.  I didn&#39;t read until I was  <br/>\nsix, so they took full credit for that!   Most kids in school don&#39;t  <br/>\nbecome fluent readers until they&#39;re nine or ten.   That is the same  <br/>\nwith unschoolers.   Some kids in school (many) still aren&#39;t fluent  <br/>\nreaders at ten, and they get shunted into classes that don&#39;t lead to  <br/>\n&quot;college bound&quot; or more academic fields.  And the worst thing is that  <br/>\nthe school itself caused some of the problem, or spotlighted it and  <br/>\nmade it worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to Joyce&#39;s clear statement, I add six paragraphs of &quot;yes,  <br/>\nbut...&quot;  (Sorry.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Incredibly Conflicted re my children&#39;s needs","postDate":"1223473736","msgId":39239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDA4MDY0OHAyOTY4Y2QwOXEyNDQwNjllZGJhZDEzNmY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDA4MDY0MGc0NTQ0NjAxMHA2ZWI3ZjA2NjEyZGE5MWNmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdjZ3F2dSthbDQ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEZEQjlCRDUxLUVFRkMtNEYwOC1BMEI0LTMwQzhFMzhBQzQxMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JIDwzYTkzZmZmMTA4MTAwODA2NDBnNDU0NDYwMTBwNmViN2YwNjYxMmRhOTFjZkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39238,"nextInTopic":39240,"prevInTime":39238,"nextInTime":39240,"topicId":39186,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have 2 sisters and a nephew who struggled with dyslexia.

My daughter  <br/>\nwrote lots of stuff backwards too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does add an extra decoding step for some kids and so takes them a  <br/>\nbit longer to figure reading out. But, given time and no pressure,  <br/>\nthey *do* figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and when I read<br/>\n&gt; to him and he asks me why he can&#39;t read it,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The real, true answer is: he&#39;s not yet ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s *not* the answer schools will give. That&#39;s *not* the answer  <br/>\nreading specialists (who will take your money) will give.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that they&#39;re lying. It&#39;s that they have zero experience (&lt;--  <br/>\nimportant! *zero* experience!) with kids who are allowed to read in  <br/>\ntheir own time. Not only don&#39;t they know what a child is like who is  <br/>\ngiven freedom to read, but they don&#39;t know that they don&#39;t know!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, worse, they truly believe what they&#39;re doing causes a child to  <br/>\nread when really the primary factor is time and waiting until all the  <br/>\nbrain areas needed for reading are fully mature.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn scientific experiments, it&#39;s important to have a control group: a  <br/>\ngroup that you do exactly the same things to *except* the special  <br/>\nthing you&#39;re testing. Without the control group, you can&#39;t know if  <br/>\nit&#39;s the special thing or some other factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reading -- in fact for all of school -- there is no control  <br/>\ngroup. Reading instructors have no clue whether what they&#39;re doing is  <br/>\nactually working better than time in a print rich, encouraging  <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are the control group. We know, because our children do  <br/>\ndemonstrate it, that reading instruction is not only unnecessary, in  <br/>\nsome cases it can be harmful to the child&#39;s sense of self worth. The  <br/>\nchild comes to believe they&#39;re failing at something mom believes they  <br/>\ncan do. When the truth is, they just aren&#39;t ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschoolers do instead of instruction is read to them, answer  <br/>\ntheir questions, listen to books on tape, watch related movies,  <br/>\nprovide access to things they want to read (video games and guides  <br/>\nhave helped lots of unschooling kids but wouldn&#39;t even be on the  <br/>\nradar of reading instructors!) Whatever the child enjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\n(None of those should be seen as necessary to reading. Those are all  <br/>\njust part of the chaos that kids pull order from. Follow your child&#39;s  <br/>\nlead in what he enjoys. Try other things out and drop them if he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; saying he wants to learn<br/>\n&gt; to read and that I do something to help him, what can I do as a<br/>\n&gt; parent?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he were six and couldn&#39;t ride a two wheeler after much trying, the  <br/>\nbest and honest -- though frustrating! -- answer for a child is that  <br/>\nhis body isn&#39;t ready and that it will be ready when it&#39;s ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* frustrating. And lots of dyslexic and nondyslexic kids have  <br/>\ngone through wanting to read but can&#39;t when they want to. Time fixes  <br/>\nit. I wouldn&#39;t stop a child from trying, but I would make it known  <br/>\nhis brain is getting ready but it just isn&#39;t there yet.

Really. He has to figure it out. It *sounds*  <br/>\ncruel, and would be if people knew some simple things to help, but  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t. The easiest way for kids to learn to read is to give them  <br/>\ntime in a supportive print rich environment. Help them be happy.  <br/>\n(Though we can&#39;t remove all unhappiness, we can be aware where we&#39;re  <br/>\ncausing it. Kids can get frustrated and unhappy when they&#39;re trying  <br/>\nto master *anything*: a Lego creation, a skateboarding trick, a video  <br/>\ngame level, making pie crust. But when they master it, the feeling of  <br/>\nhaving done it yourself is priceless :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, though, that nearly everyone believes we can teach  <br/>\nkids to read. Teachers are going through that motion all across the  <br/>\nworld, putting children through their paces and by the end of the  <br/>\nfirst year, a predictable chunk of them are reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut given the same group who were raised in unschooling homes, the  <br/>\nresults would be the same.

I am a 2nd generation homeschooler of five <br/>\nchildren ranging in ages 5-14.  I was homeschooled with the traditional <br/>\nmethod (Abeka, Bob Jones, Alpha Omega, etc.) and make my parents a bit <br/>\nnervous by unschooling :)  I joined this e-group recently and have <br/>\nenjoyed reading the conversations.  I esp. like Sandra&#39;s &#39;shoot from <br/>\nthe hip/straightforward&#39; style of &quot;talking&quot;. Ha, ha.  She usually says <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m thinking, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy 12 year old son didn&#39;t learn to read until 10ish but he knew easy <br/>\nwords like &#39;cat&#39;, &#39;hat&#39;, &#39;open&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;, &#39;mom&#39;, dad&#39; and such before <br/>\nthat. He is dyslexic as is my husband.  I did a little bit of <br/>\nAlphaphonics and McGuffy&#39;s readers with our son when he was young but <br/>\nnot much. He just got too frustrated.  He loves graphic novels (comic <br/>\nbook style) and there are so many of them these days on a variety of <br/>\nsubjects!  They&#39;re not all about superheros, lol.  My kids have checked <br/>\nout graphic biographies on George Washington and Paul Revere for <br/>\nexample.   He has a very good memory and memorizes a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have helped my husband learn to read and write better too.  I knew <br/>\nnothing about dyslexia 15 years ago other than people saw and wrote <br/>\nletters and numbers backwards.  I had no idea how help someone with <br/>\ndyslexia.  I had no idea my husband was dyslexic when I married him.  <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t either.  He was almost done with college and just thought he <br/>\nwas stupid in that area.  So I taught myself all about it.  I read <br/>\nbooks, articles, websites, talked to people, etc. over the years and <br/>\nhave learned.  I am still learning but along the way I have been able <br/>\nto help my husband and son.  Plus they have educated themselves more <br/>\nabout dyslexia so they can help themselves.  One thing I learned last <br/>\nyear was using colored page protectors.  Wish I had found that out at <br/>\nthe beginning, lol.  Anyway, the point is, you CAN teach someone with <br/>\ndyslexia.  Don&#39;t use &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; as an excuse!  I always tell my husband <br/>\nand 12 year old that dyslexia is not an excuse, it just means they have <br/>\nto work a little harder or different.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI also have a 7 year old son with Aspeager&#39;s (in the autism spectrum) <br/>\nthat takes up a lot of time and attention but is reading very well.  <br/>\nNever used Alphaphonics or any special reading program with him.  He is <br/>\nalso excellent with numbers and remembering dates and details.  Again, <br/>\nnothing that I taught him.  Our family works together to understand <br/>\nautism and learn how we can help our 7 year old.  It helps when the <br/>\nother kids in the family are on board, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI like what Lisa W. said about her son finding the &quot;door to reading <br/>\nbooks&quot;.  I would suggest you find what interests your children and <br/>\nspend your money in those areas :)  Allow them to find their door, so <br/>\nto speak.  Also, accentuate the positive.  Focus on your children&#39;s <br/>\nstrength&#39;s and natural inclinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy 12 year old son is a very talented artist and uses just about any <br/>\nmedium for his projects.  We have a nice homeschool co-op in the next <br/>\ntown over with good art classes that I make sure we offer to him.  He <br/>\nloves the outdoors and natural science.  He will read just about <br/>\nanything related to art and nature on his own, even if he has <br/>\ndifficulty with the words because it interests him.  This is his door.  <br/>\nHe also likes audio books on a variety of subjects :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy 7 year old son focuses intently on something for a few months and <br/>\nthen, after learning all he can on a subject, moves on to another one.  <br/>\nLately it has been Mesopotamia/Babylon and before that it was owls, <br/>\nspecifically barn owls.   There is no rhyme, reason or specific order <br/>\nin his choosing but we have learned to go with the flow with him.  He <br/>\nlikes to make books on whatever he&#39;s studying and uses copy paper <br/>\nstapled together to draw and write.  He dictates what he wants to say, <br/>\nI write it down and he copies it.  We go through a lot of packages of <br/>\ncopy paper and blue, black, red and green pens.  A lot!  I could <br/>\nprobably fill a whole room with all the books he&#39;s made.  He will do <br/>\nthis for hours at a time some days.  This is his door.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy job with these two and all the other children is to provide the <br/>\nmeans, resources and time for them to explore the things that interest <br/>\nthem.  I would encourage you to do the same and not worry too much.  <br/>\nEducate yourself on unschooling, dyslexia and such.  Slow down and <br/>\nenjoy your children and their interests during these years.  They grow <br/>\nup all too soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Melissa R.~~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Incredibly Conflicted re my children&#39;s needs","postDate":"1223441038","msgId":39225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NDY5Mi43NjA5My5xbUB3ZWIzMTkwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2RTk1Q0NDLTUwRTgtNDQwMC04QUUyLUIyRjQ1QkNCMjFCRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":39219,"nextInTopic":39229,"prevInTime":39224,"nextInTime":39226,"topicId":39186,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok Im sorry I havent read all of the replies .

I doubt he came to those on<br/>\nhis own.  I&#39;m guessing if the tutoring isn&#39;t helping his reading, then<br/>\nit isn&#39;t helping his emotional state either.

If there is no basis for comparison than there is no<br/>\nreason to feel badly not reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe may have asked for tutoring because it may have been the only<br/>\noption presented to him.  If you trust him to come to reading on his<br/>\nown, he may in turn trust himself to come to reading on his own.  If<br/>\nyou stop stressing out over it, it would help him to stop stressing<br/>\nout over it.  Reading to him is one of the best and most enjoyable<br/>\nthings you can do to help him.

We gave him many opportunities for rich and varied experiences as well supporting any passions or interests - strewing was also important.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is 14 now and it seems that he is reading well.  I can say that he reads what he wants to.  He can read and play games and very lengthy game guides.  He is passionate about Japanese Manga - this was the door to reading books for him.  They are books written in a comic book fashion.  He can read the backs of movies to rent.  He has begun reading the intro news page to Road Runner our internet provider - I know this because he will often mention some news item he has read.  He can look things up on eBay, the internet, Google for information, etc.  The other day he rented a movie at Block Buster - watched it in the middle of the night and told me later that it was in Japanese and he had to keep pausing it to read the sub-titles.  So given that, I would say he can read.  I never ask him to read to me, so to say he can read such and such - I really have no idea. ;)   I just see it (reading) in his everyday living.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may never read a novel - who knows?  My 2 sisters who are not dyslexic in any way, never read novels - they love magazines.  One is a pediatric head nurse at a children&#39;s hospital and one is an interior architect.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames were the first lead into his desire to read.  RuneScape was the beginning of his working at it because he wanted to.  His dad and I spent hours sitting close by so we could spell for him when he asked.  We&#39;d sit in a chair and read close to where he was playing and he would ask when he wanted help.  Eventually he got into various other games where he wanted independence and would work at the reading - that led to reading game guides, etc.  We got him an item called a Spelling Ace that gave him more independence. Then he found the Manga books and became passionate about reading those.  The manga fits with his passion for the Anime shows and movies he likes.  He is making a Japanese Samurai armor for his Halloween costume this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep talking about his independence - that came from within himself not something we forced upon him.  He just began to stay home more to play games when we ran errands, etc. and that led to his wanting to be more successful on his own.  He will still call us on our cell phones to ask how to spell a word. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

I love my <br/>\nson with all of my heart, and I really want the best for him.  When <br/>\nhe writes me notes and writes everything backwards, and when I read <br/>\nto him and he asks me why he can&#39;t read it, saying he wants to learn <br/>\nto read and that I do something to help him, what can I do as a <br/>\nparent?  I try to do the best I can for him and read constantly to <br/>\nhim as much as I can, but I&#39;m frankly overwhelmed and I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow to teach someone to not read backwards.  I&#39;m not specialized in <br/>\nthat area and I can&#39;t apologize for seeking help for him when it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething he wants and is requesting.  Yeah, maybe you&#39;re suggestion <br/>\nis correct and I should take him out of his tutoring and I guess I&#39;ll <br/>\njust have to see what happens with time that everything will fall <br/>\ninto place naturally as everything is a learning experience even <br/>\nwriting on this board and learning different perspectives is an <br/>\nincredible mind opening experience.  My main goal as his parent is <br/>\nthat I simply don&#39;t want him stressing out, but I can&#39;t help feeling <br/>\ninternally stressed seeing him unhappy, but I guess that&#39;s where my <br/>\nconflict is. I want to let things be and come naturally but when he <br/>\nseems so upset with himself, I want to help him in any way I can.  I <br/>\nwas simply seeking a perspective from a parent who has been in this <br/>\nsituation. I will do research on the suggestions provided by Ms. Dodd <br/>\nas well as others who have posted to my post, which I appreciate and <br/>\nthank you in advance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLeticia<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robyn L.
