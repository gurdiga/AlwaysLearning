So I&#39;ll<br/>\nexplain. I&#39;m on digest and I was reading in one sitting of a quick read all<br/>\nthe posts about forced cleaning and holy mother ego issues and then the post<br/>\nabout the little girl with leukemia and it all was so sad to me that we<br/>\nhumans get so caught up in the day to day nitty gritty of who the hell is<br/>\ngoing to take out the trash and how stupid it is to get all bent out of<br/>\nshape about who does it as if we, the mother of the family, are too good to<br/>\ndo it ourselves now that we became queens of our castles by the act of<br/>\npopping out a few royal servants (aka children) (of course, some are<br/>\ndisabled and would *love* to be able to take it out if they had the health<br/>\nto do so) and why and I thought I would share some of my thoughts since it<br/>\ndoes seem that the wonderful mothers on this list truly do *get it* and its<br/>\nnice to share with people who get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading the past few days and thinking there must be childhood<br/>\npain in these lives and how fierce some of the retorts were (I am not<br/>\njudging them to be bad responses, just highly charged, which I do not feel<br/>\nis a bad thing, but those kind of fierce feelings I find come from a hurt<br/>\nplace inside of me so that is what I was wondering about where were these<br/>\nfierce feelings coming from?) So then today some were sharing the terribly<br/>\nsad things that happened in childhood from forced cleaning and shaming and<br/>\ncomparing and other horrible mother mishaps and it all explains the<br/>\nfierceness we feel about how we are raising our children without shaming<br/>\nthem and without trying to get them to conform to someone&#39;s mold and I am<br/>\nhappy to be taking it all in. I hope to God with all my heart that my<br/>\nchildren will look back and not have these painful memories, but that they<br/>\nlook fondly on our time together and say they had a happy childhood that<br/>\nthey hope to repeat for their own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn forced cleaning, I was given chores to do every day, not terribly hard<br/>\nones, but a certain amount. All 3 kids helped around the house. We sort of<br/>\ndidn&#39;t love it but it wasn&#39;t too bad either. I had to go out to work at 11<br/>\nyo to help earn money to survive, that wasn&#39;t too bad either, I was cleaning<br/>\nother peoples houses, I got to keep $5 out of the money for my necessities<br/>\nsuch as clothing, schoolbooks, and whatever 11 yo&#39;s like to buy. I was very<br/>\ngood at saving my money and budgeting for what I had to buy for school. That<br/>\nwasn&#39;t too bad either, not my favorite, I thought I should have got to keep<br/>\nmore of the money, like $10, but whatever. The thing that irked me to no end<br/>\nand actually still brings my blood to boil is the time that my mother went<br/>\nshopping without me, bought socks that I f*ing hated and didn&#39;t want nor<br/>\nneed and then put them on my bed with the receipt and forced me to give her<br/>\nthe money for the socks out of my $5 and I can&#39;t remember exactly how much<br/>\nthey were but it was almost all of the $5 for the week and she left me<br/>\nnothing but change for the entire week and yelled at me about my bad<br/>\nattitude. This is a tiny sliver of her ridiculousness in my childhood, but<br/>\nreally, it still irks me to this day like the poster who posted about her<br/>\nmother throwing out her rocks she collected, this is like that for me.<br/>\nStupid f*ing socks. Still makes me burn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another thing, my sister hated making her bed, it was somehow the most<br/>\ndreaded chore in the universe for her. I was NOT allowed to make it for her,<br/>\nalthough I would sneak and make it if I thought I wouldn&#39;t get caught. Every<br/>\ntime she forgot to make the bed my mother would strip it naked, throw all<br/>\nthe sheets out the window and the mattress too onto the lawn outside and my<br/>\nsister was forced to pull it all inside, up the stairs, clean everything,<br/>\nput it all back together &quot;properly&quot; and pass inspection before she was<br/>\nallowed to go to sleep at night. That poor girl slept on a COUCH for almost<br/>\nher entire adult life she was so traumatized by the frigging bed making<br/>\nissues of our maniacal mother. We used to joke about it, b/c in our shared<br/>\napt. she had a couch to sleep on, where most of us have a bed. She only<br/>\nswitched to a bed very late in her 20&#39;s when she got a boyfriend that would<br/>\nsleep over our apt. sometimes and he refused to sleep on the end of a couch.<br/>\nI am still laughing over it right now, but only the fun times we had after<br/>\nwe got out of our mothers house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will never make my children do forced cleaning. I suppose you can see why.<br/>\nAnd I try to not mumble and grumble about it myself, since I am honored to<br/>\nhave a house that needs cleaning. There are so many homeless people in our<br/>\nown country and I cannot even go in my mind to other countries where women<br/>\nand children sleep on the streets in filth with nothing even to eat before<br/>\nthey lay down. The things I find myself not seeing as a blessing, I give it<br/>\naway to someone who is in more need than me and it lightens my workload. A<br/>\nwin/win situation. I happen to love freecycle. If I feel weighed down with<br/>\ntoo much stuff, I post it on freecycle and someone who needs it comes and<br/>\npicks it up from me and I feel happy to share my wealth and happy to be rid<br/>\nof something that I didn&#39;t want. I grew up without almost anything, so it is<br/>\nimpossible for me to throw anything away, but freecycle is *giving* and that<br/>\nI love to do.  -Arlynn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224424037,"authorName":"Jodi Stewart","from":"&quot;Jodi Stewart&quot; &lt;nextmalawi@...&gt;","profile":"nextmalawi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Man, that sucks!","postDate":"1140473491","msgId":24495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0ZGVxaitvdDZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMwMUUzRTkzLjJEQkIlYWJmYWJAYWJmYWJpbmMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24482,"nextInTopic":24504,"prevInTime":24494,"nextInTime":24496,"topicId":24472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Arlynn, Thankyou for sharing that. loss does put things into perspective.

My brother died of<br/>\ncancer at 18. My sister died of cancer at 33. My mother is mentally ill and<br/>\nonly sort of normal part of the time, and that normal time was never when we<br/>\ngrew up, the stress of life was too much for her wobbly brain to handle.<br/>\nLife is *not* fair, but we don&#39;t need to be reminded about it. We need<br/>\ncomfort and support and sometimes a big hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was so much comfort and support coming my way when my sister died<br/>\nafter 2 years of horrid treatments. Some of my clients called in a<br/>\nconference call to my home the day after Dawn died to try to cheer me up and<br/>\ngot my answering machine, I was picking out casket/flowers/tequila/etc...<br/>\nAnd this is what I hear, a room full of women (all of whom I really liked<br/>\nand still am friends with today 10 yrs later) trying to be cheerful in their<br/>\nlovely Texas rose way and say nice things on my answering machine and then<br/>\nthey all burst into huge rolling sobs, tears so bad they could not continue<br/>\nspeaking. They had to hang up and call back, embarrassed and apologizing for<br/>\nnot being *supportive*. That was THE MOST comforting message I have ever<br/>\ngotten and I told them so.<br/>\nI miss my family of origin with all of my heart, most days. Time does not<br/>\nheal all wounds. Some wounds never close. But with time the good memories<br/>\nslip back in too, not just the losses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell you that for me some mess is not that bad, too much mess is a home<br/>\nout of control and I need to get off my franny and stop whining and bless my<br/>\nfamily and myself by cleaning up. I like an organized, slightly decluttered<br/>\nhome, nice clothes washed and folded and put away, I like toilets that don&#39;t<br/>\nstink just as much as the next person. I do what I can for myself and to<br/>\nbless my family (love that Flylady.net!! She&#39;s so positive) and the rest is<br/>\nproof that my babies are ALIVE and able to run around on their own 2 legs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are raising children and they are gathering memories of their family of<br/>\norigin. Maria Montessori said The Child is the Father of the Man. What will<br/>\nour grown children remember about their childhood? How with that shape who<br/>\nthey are? I hope that my children remember that I, their mother, cleaned up<br/>\n*happily* after my family, not being too snobby or mean to be the servant of<br/>\nmy cherished family (Christ washed his disciples feet, and they were grown<br/>\nmen, certainly *able* to wash their own feet). I hope that my children<br/>\nremember that I valued their feelings more than I valued my possessions and<br/>\nthat I &quot;freely shared&quot; all that was originally mine so that they had things<br/>\nand a home of their own, given to them with love as I myself received the<br/>\ngift of life with love. I hope that they remember they are unconditionally<br/>\nloved for simply *existing*, not based on what they chose or not chose to<br/>\ndo, and that the choice is really theirs, just as the choice to conceive and<br/>\nraise them was really *my* choice (oh, yeah, dh had a fun part there too).<br/>\nAnd, very importantly, when they are adults in their probably very busy<br/>\nlives, I hope they remember to *call their mother*. (if they ever move out,<br/>\nwhich my mother says is not likely based on how well they are taken care of,<br/>\naaahhhh, the plan all comes together, lol) -Arlynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24546,"nextTopicId":24550}}
