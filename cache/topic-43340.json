I was just simply stating how it<br/>\nworks here where I am. I was not asking for help from outside sources<br/>\nbut it does help to get a fresh perspective of things. I have checked<br/>\nwith the local and hence why I am doing things that way that I am for<br/>\nAmy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to Jake the choice will always be up to him... I would never<br/>\ndo things that would contradict this. As I said I would be closely<br/>\nmonitoring how he goes - within the public schooling system. If he<br/>\nchooses to continue so be it all I can do is monitor and go from there.<br/>\nThere is no way I would &#39;poison&#39; him into thinking that one way is<br/>\nbetter than the other... as this is simply not the case at all.<br/>\nHomeschooling, public schooling, private schooling and boarding school<br/>\nall have their pros and cons it is up to the individuals (parents,<br/>\nchildren, carers etc) to find out what works for them. What may be more<br/>\nsuitable for a child homeschooling may not always benefit a child who is<br/>\nin the public sector and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Amy she has asked to be homeschooled many times. At the beginning<br/>\nof this year she even told people that she didn&#39;t want to go to school<br/>\nbut stay at home. Due to the problems she has had over the years with<br/>\nthe public sector I felt it would be of more benefit to homeschool her -<br/>\nas I had originally intended 2 years ago - rather than watch her<br/>\ncontinue to have problems which will only compound her growing and<br/>\nblossoming into a beautiful person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise if I had not made myself clearer on this in the earlier<br/>\nposting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nTania<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to Amy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From Sandra: &quot; Check with locals for sure to see how it works in<br/>\n&gt; practical terms. ......<br/>\n&gt; .....<br/>\n&gt; The problem here is the legalities...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So you didn&#39;t check with locals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list isn&#39;t for discussing legalities in local areas.

Got a bit confusing with the<br/>\nresponses...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo go over a few responses by people...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Sandra: &quot; Check with locals for sure to see how it works in<br/>\npractical terms. It doesn&#39;t seem you should need to leave her in school<br/>\nthese five weeks.... If you take her out, what&#39;s the worst that happens?<br/>\nThey suspend her? They say she needs to repeat a grade? None of that<br/>\nwill matter if you&#39;re going to homeschool her. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem here is the legalities... which unfortunately are enforced<br/>\nhere in QLD, Australia. If I keep Amy out of school whilst waiting for<br/>\nthe paper work to be processed I run a very high risk of being charged<br/>\nby the Truancy Board which can then have an effect on the registration<br/>\napplication.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand what everyone means by leaving her in school for<br/>\nthe next 5 weeks can be more harmful and this is something that I want<br/>\nto reduce as much as possible. What I have done is contact the high<br/>\nschool deputy principal and let them know that Amy is now being<br/>\nregistered for homeschooling. This means her teachers will be informed<br/>\nand so will &#39;back-off&#39; from her for a little while. Another thing is in<br/>\napproximately 1 1/2 weeks the kids will have their Easter school<br/>\nholidays which go for approx 10 days. After that I will be keeping her<br/>\nhome on the basis that she is being assessd to determine her grade<br/>\nlevels so that a program can be designed specifically for her needs. As<br/>\nthe registration process needs to know exactly what she will be taught<br/>\ndoing this will work in my favour.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow I will be ringing the Home Education Unit to ask if I can<br/>\nsubmit the registration in whilst waiting for her birth certificate.<br/>\nThis will, hopefully, reduce any delays that may occur otherwise and<br/>\nalso help clarify any thing in the report that I need to submit. If I<br/>\nwait until after the birth certifcate arrives it could take longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thank you Sandra and everyone else who helped me get thinking on a<br/>\nfew things so that this can be done in an effective way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Jenny: &quot;Schools can do a lot of damage to kids with &quot;talents&quot;. All<br/>\nkids have talents, schools only recognize and encourage some of them.<br/>\nYour daughter would be a perfect example. Artists of any kind, in<br/>\nschools, are a bit marginalized, even if the schools recognize the<br/>\ntalent... My oldest daughter, and even me, come to think of it, have<br/>\nbeen accused of living in a fantasy world. Well, why not live in my own<br/>\nworld? Why not indulge myself in this regard? It doesn&#39;t harm anyone.<br/>\nThe only harm has come from trying to ignore it, my own self<br/>\nexploration, to do what others see best. No good can come from that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand what you are saying here... I am 45 years old and<br/>\nover the last couple of years I have been struggling with my own inner<br/>\ncreativity that had been &#39;subdued&#39; due to others expectations. This<br/>\nstruggle became so bad that I had a breakdown it was difficult for me to<br/>\nlive my life whilst living the life that everyone else expected me to<br/>\ndo.... (When I was around 3 years old I was put onto a rohypnol type<br/>\ndrug by a child psyholgist as he labelled me as being hyperactive...<br/>\nluckily for me my mother didn&#39;t keep me on them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something that I have seen time and time again especially with<br/>\nwomen over the years... and having to face my own barriers wasa a very<br/>\ndifficult task but I have come to understand many things because of it.<br/>\nYears ago people would ask me what I do and I would always avoid<br/>\nanswering... but now I answer proudly when I tell people that I am an<br/>\nartist and a writer (yes my daughter has &#39;inherited&#39; my talents which<br/>\ncame from my grandfather). I was once ashamed of saying this becasue I<br/>\nwas brought up with the old cliche of  &quot;.... such and such will never<br/>\nearn you a living.... you&#39;ll be a nobody if you pursue that...&quot; etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes if we didn&#39;t have those magnificent people who lived in a fantasy<br/>\nworld we wouldn&#39;t have a world today that is so full of richness and<br/>\nbeautiful tapestries of imaginations within the stories, movies, art,<br/>\nfashion and technology that we see today... we truly owe our living to<br/>\nall the people who continued to live in &#39;their worlds.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I have to add here is that I have a partner that I need to<br/>\nwork around at this stage... he believes that Amy should be caught up<br/>\nwith her grade and then sent back to school... but I&#39;ve got time to help<br/>\nhim understand things in a better light... it doesn&#39;t help when he had a<br/>\n&#39;strict catholic education&#39;... I won&#39;t go too far into that one...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few friends backing me up. Especially the ones who have known<br/>\nAmy for some time and they all agree with me that this would be the best<br/>\nmove for Amy. I don&#39;t need anyones approval though but it does help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to my young son, Jake who is 11, when he knew that Amy was<br/>\ngoing to be homeschooled he had a panic attack and said that we was &quot;not<br/>\ngoing to be homeschooled as he wants to stay where he is&quot;. I am going to<br/>\nlet him stay - for now - but closely monitor how he goes. I will<br/>\nhowever, make the transistion of him being homeschooled once he reaches<br/>\nhigh school if not beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said I would just like to say thank you to everyone who gave<br/>\nme some insight to a few things and welcomed me...<br/>\n<br/>\nMany blessings,<br/>\nTania</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43344,"nextTopicId":43357}}
