His grandfather shook his head, shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I just don&#39;t get it.&quot;  My son, who was about 14 at the time looked quite deflated.

I don&#39;t like how they are written. Often times people tell me...*Oh, they are a hard read. They are too hard for a lot of people.* Um...I just didn&#39;t like them. I&#39;ve read plenty of books much *harder* than Tolkien...grrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s not about *getting it* or not it&#39;s about agreeing with something or not. When we imply (or assume) that people don&#39;t understand a concept we close our own minds and miss out on an opportunity to better understand the person we are talking to. We miss out on an opportunity to connect and share thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51841,"nextTopicId":51757}}
