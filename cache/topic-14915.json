I have taken many delightful classes where I have enjoyed my teachers very much and have appreciated their enthusiasm and willingness to share what they have learned with others.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe distinctions I drew in my post between teaching and learning were definitely rigid. In positive learning environments (non-coercive) those distinctions are much fuzzier and not as important.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI became a  public elementary school teacher because I like children and wanted to help them learn and grow.  I wanted to create a positive learning environment and experience for them.  I was an enthusiastic teacher.  I found that my students were not always enthusiastic learners--and why should they be?  They had little (if any) choice in what they were taught.<br/>\n <br/>\nif you are excited and your<br/>\nstudents/audience/kids have a choice in being with you, then teaching <br/>\ncan<br/>\nlead to joyful learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that &quot;choice&quot; is the key.  My children have teachers for guitar and piano.  It is their choice to learn from these people.  It&#39;s a positive thing.   Unfortunately, most school aged children do not have the choice of being or not being under someone&#39;s teaching.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like what you wrote here:<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching itself is not a bad thing -- forcing someone to sit at your <br/>\nfeet<br/>\nwhile you share the information and then insisting they repeat it back <br/>\nto<br/>\nyou in an identical manner or be punished is what makes the whole <br/>\nformal<br/>\nsystem of teaching and learning so negative.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, this I think, is a universal experience:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in classes (both as a teacher and a student) in which the<br/>\nlearning that is taking place is invigorating, exciting, and life <br/>\nchanging.<br/>\nUnfortunately I&#39;ve also been in classes in which the total opposite is <br/>\nalso<br/>\ntrue! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure about this:<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach many things during each day. From my children to my university<br/>\nstudents to my animals. They in return constantly teach me as well. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a<br/>\nreciprocal relationship IMO and if respect is shown from both sides is <br/>\nvery<br/>\nrewarding. So I guess I don&#39;t see teaching as a negative action in <br/>\nitself.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the structure and scaffolding we place around it that often spoils <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell now, sharing our lives and experiences together is different from teaching.  I learn from my animals and children, and they learn from me, but I&#39;m not sure if we are actually teaching each other.  The very idea of teaching --the teacher/student relationship-- is bound in the idea of have and have not,  authority/power and submission/passivity, the active and the passive.  But, I  do agree that teaching and the student/teacher relationship are not  necessarily bad.  It can be a very positive and rewarding experience to be taught.when you desire to learn in that setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not against teachers or teaching, really.  In my post, I just wanted to help Rachel look at learning from a different perspective.  I probably sounded a little dogmatic!  Sorry .<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed your response.  You made a very important point about the motive of teachers:  But teaching can also happen when there is a genuine love of what you want to share with others.  I do think that this is what motivates most teachers.  I&#39;m sorry if my post made teachers sound like villains.  It was truly not my intention to villify them (though re-reading the money / need to control thing that I wrote, I can certainly see how others might think that it was!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKate Green &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karegree@...\">karegree@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;Teaching happens when there is: fear (a need to control, shape or effect<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an outcome) or money ---can anyone think of any other reasons that teaching<br/>\nhappens?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell as someone who does earn money from teaching perhaps I&#39;m not the best<br/>\nto comment.

One day, a few months ago, he complained to me that some of the other &quot;posters&quot; on the board were disregarding his messages because of his poor spelling and grammar skills.  He asked for help, so I helped him.  We went over basic grammar together and also talked about spelling strategies: learning word families, practicing visual memory, phonics, etc.  It was all low key and we didn&#39;t spend much time on it.  Basically, it became important to him, so he worked on it with my encouragement and support.  That&#39;s how this unschooler handles spelling :- )<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband cannot remember the standard spelling for most words, and it hasn&#39;t held him back from becoming a very successful business person .  He is a wiz at mental math,  is well-traveled and understands the social customs of many cultures,  can turn a piece of wood into furniture, and is a terrific problem solver.  He also relies on spell check and, occassionally, his wife&#39;s very good spelling ability ;- )  to help him keep his reports and correspondence looking like everyone else&#39;s    Aren&#39;t we all handicapped in some area?  Yet, all of us have learned how to cope with our weaknesses:  we adapt, seek help, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s good to remember that the spelling of words was not &quot;standard&quot; until fairly recent history.  The printing press and mass publishing of printed material made having some kind of  standard desirable.  But let&#39;s face it, spelling is arbitrary and evolves along with language. Just pick up a book printed in the early part of the last century, and you are sure to find some words spelled differently from today. <br/>\n <br/>\n I see a shift taking place as more and more people use their computers for personal communication (instant messaging, chat rooms, message boards, etc) to accepting more relaxed spelling and especially abbreviations of words:  Ur 2 much!  (Please note:  I&#39;m not negating what I shared about my son&#39;s experience with internet communication; his spelling was unusual enough to make reading it difficult ; - )   .)<br/>\n <br/>\nRachel, here are some questions to ask schools, or anyone who teaches in a forced learning environment,  how a particular skill or subject area is taught (we&#39;ll use spelling here):    Why do you think the way you teach spelling (or any other subject) is effective?  How do you know?  Is a typical &quot;school&quot; style test a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of your methods?   <br/>\n <br/>\n---Okay, here is what I&#39;m getting at:  LOTS of adults who went to school cannot spell well (and there will be lots of adults who un-schooled who won&#39;t be able to spell well either), on the other hand, there will be those who WILL be able to spell well.  So why do we think that forced, school-style learning is effective forl earning how to spell? (or anything else for that matter!)  School-style tests almost always isolate the skill or subject being taught; for example, you write spelling words in &quot;list&quot; format.  (But, in real life, I do most of my writing in prose.)  When I was a public school teacher 15 years ago, I remember children getting all of their spelling words right on the test and then misspelling the same words when they used them in their writing.  The traditional spelling test (and, indeed, most school-style tests) really test nothing more than the student&#39;s  short-term memory  ability.  I can remember cramming for a history test in college and scoring an &quot;A&quot;, but I can&#39;t remember *anything* about that course today.  And, yet, I can tell you lots about some things that I learned in my childhood because they truly fascinated me.  One of those things I learned was how to spell--but it wasn&#39;t because I was taught spelling in school; it was because I was (and still am)  utterly fascinated by the written word.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat is learning?  I can tell you what it&#39;s not:  it&#39;s not TEACHING.   <br/>\n <br/>\nLearning happens when there is:  need, desire, curiosity, or interest.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTeaching happens when there is:  fear (a need to control, shape or effect an outcome) or money ---can anyone think of any other reasons that teaching happens?<br/>\n <br/>\nLearning is personal.
