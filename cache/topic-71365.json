I had similar concerns at first and I would like to offer a bit of advice: the read a little, try a little wait a while bit is such a gem! I had to step back and ease up and unschool myself (or at least get pretty far along!)  to get to the point of seeing all that was actually going on. I needed to be more involved, more interested, and more interesting. There are so many simple opportunities that present themselves everyday, that I am no longer super worried about learning or strewing, it is beginning to come naturally. (What works here might not work in your home- but we are currently inspired by a recent lunar eclipse and saturn in the night sky, black holes and then atoms...the galaxy and even Drake&#39;s equation for life in the universe-all from one simple comment that there would be an eclipse on such a night). My 9 yr old has memorized the planets, their order away from the sun, landmarks, satellites, mass etc on her own out of sheer joy and interest these past few days. I am not bragging, I am saying that when they come across something *they* are interested in, they will learn unless we get in the way. I am absolutely loving the swirl of excited, happy energy around here these days! Strewing the open email about the night sky sparked so much for us and it was almost effortless. Keep reading here when you feel doubtful, and keep working at finding what might interest your kids. I have genuinely benefitted from all of the advice and suggestions of those wonderful parents before us. Thank you to all the posters who help those of us elongate our patience so we can begin to &quot;get it&quot;. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lisathecelt&quot; &lt;lisathecelt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We started Radical Unschooling about 7 months ago.

One of his favorite early books was the complete Pokedex. His reading skills improved greatly the year he was 7 and he was reading the Harry Potter books before his 8th birthday.  I never sat him down for lessons, much to my mother&#39;s chagrin, and he still loves to read at 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest started to read in school.  By 1st grade he was crying regularly about how stupid he was and would never learn to read.  It was one experience that led us to homeschool and then unschool.  He did learn to read but it was a more painful experience than his 2 younger siblings have had.

We are mostly home bodies.  My kids play electronic games a lot but sometimes they want a break.  I found a bunch of sights online that gave me tons of ideas & inspiration for things to do during these times.  Here are some: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments.html&lt;http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments.html\">http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments.html&lt;http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments.html</a>&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chemistry.about.com/od/demonstrationsexperiments/u/scienceprojects.htm#s10&lt;http://chemistry.about.com/od/demonstrationsexperiments/u/scienceprojects.htm#s10\">http://chemistry.about.com/od/demonstrationsexperiments/u/scienceprojects.htm#s10&lt;http://chemistry.about.com/od/demonstrationsexperiments/u/scienceprojects.htm#s10</a>&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/coloringpages_coloringprintouts.html&lt;http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/coloringpages_coloringprintouts.html\">http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/coloringpages_coloringprintouts.html&lt;http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/coloringpages_coloringprintouts.html</a>&gt; .  One site leads to the next and there is no end to the inspiration.  I printed out ideas that I thought we would all enjoy together like recipes for oobleck and slime, sugar crystals, etc.  I have a stack of ideas here and when they get bored I have those ideas ready to suggest.  We haven&#39;t gotten through too many yet but it makes me feel more interesting and prepared!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have discovered that we also love to go to the history museum, aquarium & similar places & that&#39;s something worth leaving the house for once in awhile.  In the evenings we all get into bed in the same room and watch TV together (the kids often continue with their electronic games but they will usually listen with one ear or pause/turn off their games).  We love shows like the Travel Channel&#39;s &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot;, &quot;Mythbusters&quot; or a variety of other nature or sciency type shows.  The Sci Fi Channel has a great reality series called &quot;Face Off&quot; where the contestants compete to make the best prosthetic masks & body accessories.  It is the coolest show and very inspiring/educational.  &quot;Finding Bigfoot&quot; is another good one, Animal Planet, I think.  They pick up a lot of information from their games and You Tube videos then we watch these shows together and talk.  I can see the neurons firing & all the different connections they are making.  It&#39;s pretty neat.  I taped a couple of giant maps to the wall and have a globe next to them.  My son will get up and stare at those maps sometimes.  &quot;Mom - where&#39;s Sweden?  Pewdiepie is from Sweden...  What does their flag look like&quot;.  We are learning about the world and everything in it from the comfort of our own home.  It is amazing how much information is available at your fingertips these days!  It is so cool to see how they are absorbing information like sponges and making this giant web of connections from all these different sources.  Watching their little faces light up in those light bulb moments & seeing them feel more confident and powerful tells me we&#39;re going the right direction!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf those social media sites are making you feel anxiety maybe you should take a break from them?<br/>\n-Cass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: lisathecelt&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisathecelt@...\">lisathecelt@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 02, 2013 9:59 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] How do you know you&#39;re doing enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  We started Radical Unschooling about 7 months ago.
