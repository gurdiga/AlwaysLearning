I worried about the violence in games as mild as Mario<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has always had a very intense personality, fond of physical contact of any kind.  He has struggled with controlling his urge to hit any person or thing within range when he&#39;s frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has progressed to more sophisticated and violent games as he aged.  He has also come a long way in controlling his need for intensity to be more considerate of others.  One could argue that the games have given him a harmless outlet for fondness of action.  This be true to some extent but I think he would be more mature in his actions with or without them.  His capacity for compassion and empathy have grown, the usual requirements for sociable behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, I don&#39;t believe the violence has been &quot;bad&quot; for him.  He knows that it&#39;s a game and imaginary, he even knows how &quot;bloody&quot; the violence will be depending on the rating; &#39;E&#39;, &#39;T&#39; or &#39;M&#39;.
