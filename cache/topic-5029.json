But I like practical<br/>\ncrafts.  I don&#39;t like crafts that create a &quot;something&quot;<br/>\nwhich is then just a piece of garbage or kitchy piece<br/>\nof brick-a-brack.  I like crafts like knitting,<br/>\ncrochet, scrapbooking (which very practically uses the<br/>\npictures that are hiding in boxes in the closet),<br/>\nwoodworking and others of that nature.  Most of the<br/>\ncrafts in all the kids&#39; craft sites/books and other<br/>\nsources create useless garbage mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s a good thing that I feel that way,<br/>\nbecause my kids hate crafts.  They love to cut and<br/>\npaste, paint and play with modeling dough and other<br/>\nthings, but they HATE crafts.  They don&#39;t want to<br/>\nfollow steps of make any cute little napkin holder or<br/>\ndecorated pencil jar or something.  If they feel<br/>\n&quot;crafty&quot; I always just let them have free reign with<br/>\nthe craft supplies.  If I am making gifts for others<br/>\nfor some occassion, I just make them, and the kids can<br/>\nlend a hand at some point in the process if they feel<br/>\nlike it, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older boy is a perfectionist too and very hard on<br/>\nhimself.  He has the I-CAN&#39;T&#39;s a lot too, usually<br/>\nrealted to things that he thinks he cannot do to his<br/>\nexacting standards yet or when he is tired or<br/>\nimpatient.  I know he is independent enough to<br/>\neventually find that *WE* don&#39;t do things to meet his<br/>\nexacting standards and to begin insisting on doing it<br/>\nall himself.  He already does that about some things. <br/>\nSo I am not worried about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
