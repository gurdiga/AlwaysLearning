They choose school because it offers what they believe their kids need to have a secure future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are all sorts of horrible messages about school out there. And have been since the 60s when the big push to get kids into college began. Yet droves of parents still choose school. That speaks volumes about how fearful parents are that their kids can&#39;t get what they need for their kids: the stuff that schools teach.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d think schools failing, kids suffering would make parents abandon schools. But it has the opposite effect. It says that if the experts can&#39;t get what kids need into them, it must be a near impossible task. Which makes parents feel even more dependent on the schools. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why unschooling is unlikely to be seen as an alternative to school. Because it isn&#39;t a better way to get school knowledge into kids. What parents want is school without the bad parts. But they&#39;re willing to put up with -- well, force their kids to put up with -- the bad parts to get what they&#39;re absolutely convinced is essential for future security.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil parents understand that the knowledge schools push into kids isn&#39;t what kids need to succeed, parents will cling to schools. And I don&#39;t see that realization happening any time soon. The process may be torture for the kids but companies aren&#39;t shutting their doors to them in massive number and saying they want unschooled kids instead. Companies are, though, choosing Chinese and Indian technical graduates. Unfortunately the perception is the Chinese and Indians are doing school even better. The reality is more complex, but it reinforces the message that school is necessary for a secure job.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"casouthworth","from":"&quot;casouthworth&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unsupportive family members","postDate":"1351630707","msgId":69531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs2cGYxaitua2M2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDEzMy1kczRDQkRDNTA5QzIzNEY3NTZBREQ1NEM0NjIwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":69529,"nextInTopic":69540,"prevInTime":69530,"nextInTime":69532,"topicId":69517,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Since we had moved him into a mobile home on our property<br/>\nafter my mother&#39;s death  (after several months of me basically having two<br/>\nresidences to take care of him 200 miles away) the concerns were very<br/>\n&quot;close up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped when I shared just how much schools (in this area at least) had<br/>\nchanged since I attended.   We did &quot;give in&quot; and let my father assume the<br/>\nexpenses and a new school wardrobe and enrolled the oldest in 7th grade. My<br/>\nson &quot;wanted&quot; to attend.  I believe he and his grandfather &quot;partnered&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;lobby&quot; for the agreement.    My son wanted to meet girls and was able to<br/>\naccomplish that within the first few days.   He stayed in public school a<br/>\nlittle over a year and by that time my father was saying he wished he had<br/>\nnever pushed for it.  That he simply could not imagine how students were<br/>\ntreated (like prisoners).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your father lives in a different city, you might explain to him that HE<br/>\nwould not want his granddaughter in the schools in your area.   You also<br/>\nmight encourage him to volunteer in his local middle school (or whatever<br/>\nthe current name is for your daughter&#39;s grade level) and imagine his<br/>\ngranddaughter interacting in the lunchroom and hallways.   Although I was a<br/>\nvery longtime critic of &quot;school&quot; ,  I was horrified just walking in the<br/>\nhall of the school my son attended.  The toxic atmosphere  was far worse<br/>\nthan anything I had imagined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should continue visiting him although being ever willing to cut<br/>\nthe visits short if he becomes rude and aggressive about ANY subject.<br/>\nGood for him  to see that his granddaughter continues to develop into a<br/>\nresponsible citizen .  I think it good for these visits to take place<br/>\nduring what would typically be &quot;school days&quot;.  I know families in which the<br/>\nfact of more frequent access to the children was a huge positive for<br/>\nhomeschooling.  My opinion is that it is fine for you as a parent to<br/>\nexplain to ANYONE that part of your job is protecting your child.   And<br/>\nthat you will not keep your child in an environment where someone is rude<br/>\nand aggressive.   Doesn&#39;t matter if the behavior is focused DIRECTLY on the<br/>\nchild or on someone the child loves (you).<br/>\n<br/>\nShort version: sometimes the best way to deal is &quot;How about them Giants?,<br/>\nPass the Dip please&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Oct 30, 2012 at 10:14 AM, louise.king76 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louise.j.king@...\">louise.j.king@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone had to deal with members of family of origin who are against<br/>\n&gt; Home Education?<br/>\n&gt; We are really struggling right now with my father, who is a retired State<br/>\n&gt; teacher.
