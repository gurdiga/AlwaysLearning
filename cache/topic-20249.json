Teams take turns singing at least eight words of the song <br/>\ncontaining that phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are FULL of song lyrics they can access, even non-singers.

Another thing the game does by itself is cause people to stop keeping <br/>\nscore after a while.  It&#39;s too fun and its so intrinsically entertaining that <br/>\neverybody&#39;s winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it has very little to do with a model of the universe, but it&#39;s a little <br/>\nlike hooking your brain up to a diagnostic test that gives you an <br/>\nincomprehensible printout.

It was at LEAST 6 or 7 years ago when we first discussed  that on <br/>\nAOL.  It was very profound for me and one of the things that most  helped me <br/>\non <br/>\nmy way to unschooling.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember which professor said it.  I think it was a philosophy class <br/>\nand we were meeting outside.   It was a weird idea which i rejected.  She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t use the term &quot;model of the universe,&quot; but the idea that the universe exists <br/>\ninside us was so strange to me that it bothered me that she had said it. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nSo I carried it around like a rock in my shoe for a while.  And I was taking <br/>\na lot of educational psychology classes in those days, and literature (English <br/>\nmajor) and I started to realize that I had the Bible in my head, and not only <br/>\nthe version I had been taught in Sunday schooll, but the one I had read <br/>\nmyself and pondered, and what I knew about the Catholic Bible and the differences, <br/>\nand the history of the Bible, and traditions and superstitions about the Bible <br/>\n(the black spot passage from Treasure Island), and translations (my friend&#39;s <br/>\ndad had translated the New Testament into Tewa, the language of the pueblos on <br/>\neither side of my home town).  I realized the the Bible in my head was HUGE.  <br/>\nBigger than a single real Bible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my head was filling up with other stories and characters and ideas (with <br/>\ntheir histories and refutations) and maps and charts and relationships of <br/>\npeople real and current, dead, fictional...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in adding to that what I was reading about cognition and memory, I started <br/>\nto see all that as building a model.    I still think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne long &quot;wonder&quot;/fantasy I had since I was nine or ten was the idea of <br/>\nchanging brains, or looking through someone else&#39;s eyes to see if the colors seemed <br/>\nthe same or other things seemed the same.   And I still think about that too, <br/>\nsometimes.  Having kids stirred it up.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad saw things much in terms of construction.  He was always aware of <br/>\nwhere water and sewer lines were, electrical lines, bearing walls, water walls.    <br/>\nHe saw the whole world that way, in terms of access and drainage and <br/>\nstability.   I wouldn&#39;t have understood his sorting and analysis, from inside of him.  <br/>\n He wouldn&#39;t have understood my categorizing people sometimes by their place <br/>\nof origin, their religion, their chosen/intended social goal/position.   He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t much care about that, though he could converse with me when I brought <br/>\nthings up.  He knew (but didn&#39;t much care &lt;g&gt;) that someone from Alabama was <br/>\ngoing to react to a set of circumstances differently from someone from Oregon <br/>\nwould.   He has a Depression/WWII overlay on his world.   I didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo each person&#39;s perspective is unique.  But &quot;a unique perspective&quot; is a <br/>\nteensier  concept than the idea that each person&#39;s model of the universe is <br/>\never-growing and hugely elaborate, and each person sees THAT world, in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people are interested in this, I want to talk about associations we have <br/>\nwith things (how they&#39;re connected or categorized), but if it&#39;s not to be an <br/>\nongoing topic that&#39;s fine too.  I&#39;ve written too much. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20273,"nextTopicId":20272}}
