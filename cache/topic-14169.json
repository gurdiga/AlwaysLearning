Every one of the mom&#39;s has<br/>\npraised her child&#39;s advanced reading abilities, and yet they all seem to<br/>\nuse reading curriculum.  Curriculum!  For reading!  For older kids who<br/>\nread quite well!

I&#39;m cleaning out my mailbox, though, and didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant it to go untold.   <br/>\n<br/>\nApril 24.  Marty (14) came in and was describing some exciting detail of one <br/>\nof the games he&#39;s was designing, and read this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If an antagonist is assigned a protagonist you can spend one conviction to <br/>\nreverse the assignment&quot;  but he mispronounced &quot;antagonist.&quot;  He knew he was, <br/>\nhe was stumbling, and I said it for him and he said &quot;right!&quot; and went on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the whole story. &lt;g&gt;  Thanks for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I saved it is that it seemed a peek into Marty&#39;s writing and <br/>\nreading levels.  <br/>\nHe knows the word visually, but he hadn&#39;t heard it so much out in the air.  I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s a point at which the odd kind of reading people do when they get <br/>\nfast is proven.  There&#39;s an English language past sounding out words, in a <br/>\nway.  There&#39;s that total reading for comprehension, not for the art of it.   <br/>\nAnd that&#39;s the way I read almost always, which is probably why poetry is <br/>\ngenerally irritating to me.  I don&#39;t turn the words back into sound when I <br/>\nread.  I know how, but that&#39;s another kind of slow (and kind of irritating <br/>\nfor me, honestly) reading.   I don&#39;t think this is such a great thing but <br/>\nit&#39;s highly prized in school and testing situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for good or ill, I saw a flash of it in Marty mispronouncing a word he had <br/>\nhimself dredged up, written down, and used correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, I didn&#39;t know those terms &quot;antagonist and protagonist&quot; when I <br/>\nwas his age, and I was it on a stick at my school, the #1 student and I had <br/>\nan ID card to prove it.  (Weird but true, they numbered our IDs in the order <br/>\nof our test scores on some special test for some special program they were <br/>\ntrying at our school, and they &quot;tracked us,&quot; and the top group had special <br/>\ncolor school IDs that said &quot;the go-go group&quot; and although I don&#39;t remember <br/>\nany special privileges that went with it, I remember thinking even then that <br/>\nit was a kind of social and interpersonal mistake for them to have done that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo without testing him, there was a snapshot moment where I could compare him <br/>\nto other fixed marks.   It might be a month or many years before one comes <br/>\nalong on its own again, and it&#39;s not important, but I thought it was <br/>\ninteresting in a &quot;how do you know what your kids are learning&quot; kind of way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14209,"nextTopicId":14211}}
