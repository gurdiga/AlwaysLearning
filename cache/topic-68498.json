Then we","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1080604962\">In my experience, a desktop computer at that age is very limiting. We had desktop computers for our girls, but they were bouncing all over the place. Then we got them Leapster Explorers and they were in heaven. LeapPads may feel limiting to you, but there are lots of games on them, they&#39;re portable, she can curl up away from little brother, or by you, or in the car ... they&#39;re smaller, not really breakable. Our girls really enjoyed theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur eight year old has passed hers down to her little brother and almost exclusively uses her laptop now but our 5 year old (almost 6) uses her Leapster still when we travel - she uses her laptop at home more. Laptops are bigger and more clunky for little ones to handle unless you get her a netbook type laptop, but she won&#39;t be able to watch dvds on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it funny that I can contribute to a thread like this since when my oldest was born I was not going to allow electronics.

We got one after my daughter played with a friend&#39;s and she loved it for a couple years. They have some nice advantages in that they&#39;re designed with little kids in mind - little people who aren&#39;t always gentle or squeaky clean ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because she has a Leap Pad, that doesn&#39;t bar her from ever using other computers, too. Get a couple games for your regular computer. Maybe look into a used console system (Playstation, Wii...those kinds of things) and some games for little kids - there will be more two-player options available, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt definitely helps to think about What people are going to be doing and then see which devices will support that activity. If it&#39;s read-aloud sorts of things, a Leap Pad is fantastic. If it&#39;s games you&#39;d do better with a system especially designed for games. If you have a kid who likes to write or draw on-screen, then a designated computer may be your best bet. But any of those have limitations. If nothing else, kids grow and their interests change. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re really unsure or in a money crunch, buy used and upgrade later. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] computer for almost 5 year old","postDate":"1344101692","msgId":68499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1MTFDQTQ1LTE3RDQtNDhBMS1BNkUyLTZBNDIwNzJEMDYxNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwY2QwMWNkNzI0NyQ5MTJhMzdjMCRiMzdlYTc0MCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwY2QwMWNkNzI0NyQ5MTJhMzdjMCRiMzdlYTc0MCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":68498,"nextInTopic":68500,"prevInTime":68498,"nextInTime":68500,"topicId":68498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My daughter wants a LeapPad, but I think that will be too limiting.-=- There are many advantages to buying her what she wants.
