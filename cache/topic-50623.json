I&#39;ve been promulgating that idea since 1987, first in  <br/>\nthe SCA and then in unschooling-world, and I&#39;m surely not the only one  <br/>\nwho ever &quot;figured it out,&quot; but there is a certain way I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nwording it since it started it out as &quot;make the more medieval choice.&quot;  <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew Elijah was homeschooled a while, unschooled after being  <br/>\nfrustrated with the gifted program when he was little. When he went  <br/>\nback in 8th or 9th grade, he carefully calculated his class  <br/>\nperformance to get C&#39;s.  Not B, not D.  C.  It was more work than  <br/>\ngetting an A. &lt;g&gt;  He wanted to be average.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust before this, I answered an ancient e-mail or two.

It is about a girl named Nora who is in middle school and is exceptionally brilliant.  Nora does not want to let others know because she does not want to be treated or thought of as any different from anyone else.   In fifth grade, her friend Stephen becomes very anxious about grades as do most of the kids.  To help show her friend that grades don&#39;t really reflect what one knows, she purposely gets all D&#39;s on her report card (and one C by accident).  I won&#39;t give away the rest of the story, but it is a good read!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yr old daughter asked me to read it and thought I&#39;d like it.  She was right!  I was excited to read it when I noticed that the author thanked Alfie Kohn (in note from author on copyright page)!  Also, the librarian in the book advises Nora that there are always at least two choices to make and to pick the better one.
