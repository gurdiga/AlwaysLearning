So we decided<br/>\nthat was ok and we&#39;d drive up anyway.  30 minutes later we got there to<br/>\nfind that we had the wrong day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we turned around and went to this cool little store we had just<br/>\npassed with some walnut orchards next door.  We all shopped for birthday<br/>\npresents for me and the other mom (both birthdays are this month).  Then<br/>\nwe went next door and the kids cracked and ate walnuts.  So peaceful and<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen back in the car and off to the tide pools.  We played on the beach<br/>\nand chased sea gulls, had a picnic, then went to the natural history<br/>\nmuseum and played there.  Then a cool little cafe, with hundreds of<br/>\nantique cookie jars in it, for a snack and off home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if we can just remember what day we were supposed to be at the<br/>\nmelodrama!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this list, no arguing, just unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Yesterday","postDate":"1032958156","msgId":9570,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTI1LjA2NDkxNy4xMjg4LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9894,"prevInTime":9569,"nextInTime":9571,"topicId":9570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yesterday a man in our small town killed himself.
