I was at Toys R Us with my two youngest and at the cash we ran into my eldest son&#39;s 3rd grade teacher.  I must say that she was the one great teacher we ran across (he left midway through grade 4).  She was on maternity leave with 2 young kids in tow.  She asked after Joseph and I said he was doing great.  She was happy to hear that; then I added, &quot;we&#39;re homeschooling, not sure if you knew&quot;.  She didn&#39;t, and quickly followed that up with &quot;How does that work?  You have the curriculum?&quot;  I explained the provincial curriculum is available online but you don&#39;t need to follow it, just tell them you&#39;re homeschooling and that&#39;s that.  I could just see the wheels turning as she plopped her purchases on the counter ... likely imagining how she&#39;d feel when her kids got one of the many other teachers that don&#39;t care about the students as much as she does.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know what I&#39;d say if I ran across his 4th grade teacher however!  Hopefully along the lines of what you suggested ... or maybe I&#39;d lose my nerve and just gush about what an amazing kid he is and how happy we are to have him home with us.  Which he is and we are!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Life","postDate":"1079010371","msgId":18975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1LjI0MGEzNjRjLjJkODFiZTQzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18976,"prevInTime":18974,"nextInTime":18976,"topicId":18975,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yesterday was interesting, cool, and sweet.

I was going through a box and came across his &quot;School Days&quot; <br/>\nbook, from when he spent time in school through the third grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe looked through it together. There were his report cards, some examples of <br/>\n&quot;work&quot;, his school pictures, his first baby tooth, a letter to Santa, and his <br/>\nbirthday party invitations. His first few years at school were not <br/>\nparticularly scathing, actually. The teachers liked him a lot, although they mentioned <br/>\nhis handwriting (which is still awful) and his lack of participation in class, <br/>\nexcept for when they were doing arctic and carribean animals (&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re <br/>\nfinally doing something that interests him!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis first few years mentioned that math was his strongest subject, and the <br/>\nsecond grade teacher mentioned that he was great at creative writing! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe third grade teacher wanted to refer him to special ed because of his <br/>\nhandwriting, his lack of participation in class, and that he wasn&#39;t memorizing his <br/>\ntimes tables. He came out of the third grade with little confidence, <br/>\nespecially in math and writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said that I wish I could run into her. Julian laughed and said, &quot;With your <br/>\ncar?&quot;  I said no, but that I would tell her how much she had hurt Julian, but <br/>\nthat I was also grateful in one way, because third grade finally convinced his <br/>\nother two parents that we should pull him out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, last evening, we attended a candlelight vigil in support of equal ma<br/>\nrriage rights for gay folks. I was a speaker, and Julian spoke too. We live in <br/>\nMassachusetts, and my partner, Beth, and I are planning to get married <br/>\n(legally!) on June 5th. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulian was sweet and eloquent, speaking in front of lots of people. He said, <br/>\n&quot;I hope the legislature understands that, even if my family looks different <br/>\nfrom other families, that we&#39;re still a family and deserve civil rights. I hope <br/>\nthat they won&#39;t write discrimination into our constitution.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, a man came up to him and asked if it was hard to talk about being <br/>\ngay with his friends. Julian explained that he is not gay, and the man <br/>\nstarted apologizing profusely. Julian said it wasn&#39;t a big deal, that he didn&#39;t <br/>\nconsider it an insult. It reminded me of when he was little and people thought he <br/>\nwas a girl. They&#39;d get all flustered, but he didn&#39;t think that was an insult <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kid is so cool.
