Ok yeah, so I m a fan. I have read your writings for years and found them some of the most encouraging","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-121760089\">Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are wonderful in the &quot;answering&quot; business!  Ok yeah, so I&#39;m a fan. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read your writings for years and found them some of the most <br/>\nencouraging I&#39;ve ever read. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean the words won&#39;t zing the old ego.  Your words are <br/>\nedifying for the very fact that you do not go around Robin Hood&#39;s barn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that came from the idea that he didn&#39;t have a barn because some <br/>\npeople put out a lot of words without saying anything meaningful.  That<br/>\n<br/>\nis not you.  You write for a purpose. This is why from the comfort of<br/>\nmy <br/>\nhome before my computer screen I have entertained ideas that have not <br/>\nbeen customary for me.  It hasn&#39;t always been comfortable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is no one&#39;s fault.  If I express myself in a similar language to <br/>\nthat which you use, which I sometimes do, I find myself alienating my <br/>\nlistener.  Broader horizons are hard to come by.  It&#39;s like busting sod<br/>\n<br/>\nto plant crops on soil that has never been used for that purpose.  The <br/>\nclods break down to make room for the crop.  If someone doesn&#39;t want <br/>\ntheir &quot;soil/soul&quot; to be used for the purpose of unschooling or<br/>\nwhatever, <br/>\nthey decide to think about ideas, dismiss them, postpone them, abuse <br/>\nthem, etc.  There are a myriad of choices.  If someone is unschooling <br/>\nwho finds the work burdensome: never to unschool is one possibility,<br/>\nnot <br/>\nto unschool now is another, finding out how it could work better in <br/>\none&#39;s life is yet another, unschooling incorrectly in an attempt to <br/>\nlighten one&#39;s load (which doesn&#39;t work) is another choice, and there<br/>\nare <br/>\na ton of others available.  They all wait in the wings.  We direct the <br/>\n&quot;play.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling to me is an incredibly freeing idea.  It lightens the load,<br/>\n<br/>\nnot the other way around.  One reason unschooling is not always a <br/>\nfreeing idea to people is that some of what passes for love of children<br/>\n<br/>\nis really not so.  It&#39;s ownership/narcissism, and many of people who <br/>\nrelate in such a way with children.. especially their own...  have no <br/>\nreal wish to deal with the truth of it.  This doesn&#39;t mean they have NO<br/>\n<br/>\nlove for their children (which might be true but hopefully isn&#39;t).  <br/>\nRather it might mean there are other things in the way curtailing its <br/>\nfullest expression.  I know that I can be highly insensitive to the <br/>\nneeds of others, and I don&#39;t want to do that, and so I know the first <br/>\nstep to avoiding insensitivity is to realize that it exists in ME... <br/>\nunhappy thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren join the household mileau as people or as different types of <br/>\npersonal accessories or accomplishments for the ones in charge of the <br/>\nhousehold, or other unacceptable things rather than having the freedom <br/>\nto be their own person.  Parents are more powerful than children, and<br/>\nit <br/>\nis a mistake not to realize the responsibility of this power.  Of<br/>\ncourse <br/>\nmany parents never admit to the less humanizing roles they put in place<br/>\n<br/>\nfor their children.  To do so requires dismissing the role of being in <br/>\ncharge in order to become fertile ground for other ideas that actually <br/>\nappeal more, which mean pain and growth, that replace &quot;old soil&quot; with <br/>\n&quot;new soul&quot; to shine life through.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;For years I accepted private responses, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;do what basically amounts to following someone home from a public<br/>\n </span></blockquote>meeting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and punching her on her own front porch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The e-mail is below, but I want to say that I am not &quot;in the answering<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;business.&quot;   If it were a business I wouldn&#39;t be doing it voluntarily <br/>\n&gt;and every single day.
