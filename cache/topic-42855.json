There are parts of <br/>\nthe world where there is a culture of violence and poverty and sometime <br/>\nhopelessness.

I just learned this morning that a young <br/>\n(7yo) boy was molested, at knife point, at our local municipal building <br/>\ntwo days ago. This is the building that houses our library (aka our <br/>\nhome-away-from-home). It is also the building which houses the police <br/>\ndepartment. Safe, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parenting style is...well...you can probably deduce just from my <br/>\npresence in this group that I trust my kids to lead and show when they <br/>\nare ready to handle new challenges. Things like exercising independence. <br/>\nMy eldest is a very emotionally precocious and responsible 5. Two weeks <br/>\nago I got read the riot act by a volunteer at our local community center <br/>\nfor having let him &quot;run around&quot; unattended. What I *had* done was show <br/>\nhim around the building, explain the boundaries that I wanted him to <br/>\nobserve, introduce him to the staff on duty, and walk him to the <br/>\nrestroom. When he expressed a desire to &quot;do it himself&quot;, I reminded him <br/>\nof where I would be--at the other end of a short and open hallway. And I <br/>\nleft him to navigate his way back, which he did promptly and without <br/>\nincident. He handled himself appropriately, and I praised him for his <br/>\nmaturity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tongue-lashing I got from the volunteer later (he watched for us and <br/>\naccosted me on our way out the door) threw me. On one hand, I know what <br/>\nmy child is able to handle and fully trusted him. On the other hand, I <br/>\nrealize that he is very young and less likely than an older child to be <br/>\nable to protect himself and more likely to raise suspicion from <br/>\nonlookers. I was unsettled for quite a while, not sure whether I thought <br/>\nthe man was a grouchy old fuddy-duddy or I was an irresponsible parent. <br/>\nOr neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am smacked in the face with a reminder of how we can&#39;t trust even <br/>\nthe familiar, safe, known places to be free from threat. My son is more <br/>\nfamiliar with the library than with Grandma&#39;s house, and is completely <br/>\ncomfortable there. I like that comfort. I like that he has the <br/>\nconfidence to navigate the building on his own. And suddenly, I am <br/>\nterrified that a knife-wielding pedophile is going to attack him the <br/>\nsecond he is out of my direct line of sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what has my mind churning right now is...how do you strike a <br/>\nbalance between encouraging your child&#39;s independence and recognizing <br/>\ntheir maturity level...and just plain protecting them from the Big Bad <br/>\nWorld? As a mother reading that news story, I feel compelled to hover. <br/>\nAs a mother who wants to preserve my children&#39;s confidence, I am afraid <br/>\nthat too much hovering will do them a disservice. I suppose it&#39;s really <br/>\na matter of striking a healthy balance. I&#39;m not sure how or if I will <br/>\nrecognize that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not yet fully trust either my child or the world enough to leave <br/>\nhim completely on his own in public situations, but I do &quot;allow&quot; him (by <br/>\nvirtue of trust and not-overly-hovering) more liberty than many of his <br/>\nage-peers. I am finding it difficult to reconcile this desire to honor <br/>\nhis independence with my duty (and biological imperative) to protect him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be very interested in hearing others&#39; views on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42782,"nextTopicId":42878}}
