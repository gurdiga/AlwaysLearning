She was surprised at how calm and knowledgeable she was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine and a different friend&#39;s teenage daughter were having a<br/>\n&gt; conversation in the locker room of their health club. A woman who overheard<br/>\n&gt; them came out and asked the adult who that kid was, she was SO articulate<br/>\n&gt; and smart. My friend said that the girl was homeschooled. The woman <br/>\n&gt; replied,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I used to be against homeschooling, but after hearing that, I&#39;ve changed <br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; mind.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And believe me, it was just an ordinary, everyday conversation they were<br/>\n&gt; having, not rocket science or advanced mathematics.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s the thing.<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;m impressed with Julian, but certainly will agree that I may be <br/>\nbiased. But almost daily people meet him and are blown away by him...again, <br/>\nnot talking about Times Tables and Narrative Essay Writing, but normal <br/>\nconversation, where he talks with passion about music, history, things he&#39;s <br/>\nread, making chain mail, politics, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently Julian and I had this program in RI scheduled, and decided to go out <br/>\nthe night before to visit my aunt and uncle. I hadn&#39;t seen them in a long <br/>\ntime, since way before my mom died, and we were bringing my aunt a memento <br/>\nfrom my mom&#39;s things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter being astonished by Julian&#39;s size, we had a very nice dinner where they <br/>\nwere fascinated at how smart and interesting he was. They have relatives that <br/>\nare homeschooling their kids in a very bad situation (probably kids will be <br/>\nremoved relatively soon, for VERY just cause), and kept talking about how <br/>\nTHIS is how homeschooling should look. I actually started describing <br/>\nUnschooling (usually don&#39;t bother), and they were enthusiastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not hard to see that this is okay...even if you&#39;re someone who is <br/>\nconcerned with kids knowing &quot;the  basics,&quot; you can talk to someone and <br/>\nKNOW...it&#39;s so sad when people, who ostensibly love someone, don&#39;t bother to <br/>\ndo that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand...this is a woman who referred to her children when they <br/>\nwere kids as Dumb Fuck 1 and 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13291,"nextTopicId":13308}}
