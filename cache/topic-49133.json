No, they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>\nenslave me with endless housework, and no, I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>\nthe housework. They are just having fun, and I can choose to facilitate that.  I WANT to make that happen!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember as a kid, feeling like I had worked hard at home <br/>\nto do everything right.  And I got it about 99% right, and I got <br/>\nhell for the 1% that I hadn&#39;t gotten right.  I remember getting<br/>\nyelled at for dripping water on the floor after a shower:  &quot;YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRY OFF COMPLETELY WHILE STANDING IN THAT SHOWER STALL!&quot;  I remember being shamed for not squeezing the toothpaste tube from the botton and flattening it as I went up.  (I guess that would be funny if it weren&#39;t sad.)  There was *always* something <br/>\nlike that I was forgetting, and I just don&#39;t want anything<br/>\nresembling that for my children.  So I choose to drop the <br/>\nexpectations about what is &quot;age appropriate.&quot;  (It&#39;s easier said <br/>\nthan done, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from choosing and choosing <br/>\nagain, reminding myself that what I want is for my children to feel deeply loved for who they are right now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI found myself in the mall recently, and one shop was selling<br/>\nsigns to hang in the home, and one of those signs read, &quot;Be kinder<br/>\nthan is necessary.&quot;  I like that.  I don&#39;t know if it is even<br/>\npossible, but it is a nice guiding principle, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks to all of you.
