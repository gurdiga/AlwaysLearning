Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed <br/>\n </span></blockquote>children as those who know how they want the world to be run and have <br/>\nno tolerance for anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The <br/>\nstrong-willed child is very persistent and is willing to take <br/>\npunishment in order to win on any given issue. Because they are <br/>\ngifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are not always overtly <br/>\ndefiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in their <br/>\nattempts to control. They are willing to and capable of causing <br/>\nemotional upset in order to gain the upper hand. Strong-willed <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t necessarily want to control everyone around them. They <br/>\njust don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone else. Discipline: Calm is <br/>\nBetter! Discipline is a key issue when it comes to molding a strong-<br/>\nwilled child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and <br/>\nconsequences. When expectations are violated, be sure to be <br/>\nconsistent in discipline. According to Smiley, parents who cancel <br/>\npunishments midstream are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining <br/>\nstrong-willed kids, control your emotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. <br/>\nKendra says, &quot;An out-of-control adult is not effective and is usually <br/>\ncounterproductive. When we (as parents) go out of control, the strong-<br/>\nwilled child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s son, Aaron, a strong-<br/>\nwilled child when growing up, claims that discipline worked best when <br/>\nit was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that <br/>\nhe needed to dig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to <br/>\nbecome responsible adults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to <br/>\nfocus, to remind themselves that they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot your calling to be your child&#39;s &quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling <br/>\nand privilege to be your child&#39;s parent. With a strong-willed child, <br/>\nchoosing battles wisely is important - but so is the corollary: Be <br/>\nsure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley believes that moms <br/>\nand dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to parenting <br/>\nstrong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to <br/>\nparenting is normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and <br/>\ndads not disagree on parenting issues in front of the strong-willed <br/>\nchild. The strong-willed child is very attentive to differences in <br/>\nhow Mom and Dad handle parenting issues. As a result, parents who <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open themselves up to <br/>\ninstances where their child will play one parent off the other in his <br/>\nor her efforts to gain control. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: MIL Strong-Willed Child Article","postDate":"1167970529","msgId":27595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyRDdEN0E1LUU2RkMtNDZFOC1BMEVBLTZDQjE3REJDMjlCRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVuOWdvMys3bjJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVuOWdvMys3bjJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27558,"nextInTopic":27668,"prevInTime":27594,"nextInTime":27596,"topicId":27532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed <br/>\n </span></blockquote>children as those who know how they want the world to be run and <br/>\nhave no tolerance for anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The <br/>\nstrong-willed child is very persistent and is willing to take <br/>\npunishment in order to win on any given issue. Because they are <br/>\ngifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are not always <br/>\novertly defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in <br/>\ntheir attempts to control. They are willing to and capable of <br/>\ncausing emotional upset in order to gain the upper hand. Strong-<br/>\nwilled children don&#39;t necessarily want to control everyone around <br/>\nthem. They just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone else. <br/>\nDiscipline: Calm is Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes <br/>\nto molding a strong-willed child. Smiley advises setting clear <br/>\nexpectations and consequences. When expectations are violated, be <br/>\nsure to be consistent in discipline. According to Smiley, parents <br/>\nwho cancel punishments midstream are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when <br/>\ndisciplining strong-willed kids, control your emotions. Don&#39;t <br/>\ndiscipline in anger. Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control adult is not <br/>\neffective and is usually counterproductive. When we (as parents) go <br/>\nout of control, the strong-willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, <br/>\nKendra&#39;s son, Aaron, a strong-willed child when growing up, claims <br/>\nthat discipline worked best when it was unemotional. Anger in <br/>\ndiscipline was a sure sign to him that he needed to dig in his own <br/>\nheels. Our goal is to raise our kids to become responsible adults. <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to focus, to remind themselves <br/>\nthat they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s not your calling to be <br/>\nyour child&#39;s &quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling and privilege to be <br/>\nyour child&#39;s parent. With a strong-willed child, choosing battles <br/>\nwisely is important - but so is the corollary: Be sure to win <br/>\nbattles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley believes that moms and dads <br/>\nneed to provide a unified front when it comes to parenting strong-<br/>\nwilled kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to <br/>\nparenting is normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms <br/>\nand dads not disagree on parenting issues in front of the strong-<br/>\nwilled child. The strong-willed child is very attentive to <br/>\ndifferences in how Mom and Dad handle parenting issues. As a result, <br/>\nparents who don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open <br/>\nthemselves up to instances where their child will play one parent <br/>\noff the other in his or her efforts to gain control. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"hahamommy@sio.midco.net","from":"hahamommy@...","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: MIL Strong-Willed Child Article","postDate":"1167593998","msgId":27535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNjc1OTM5OTguNDU5ODEyMGUxODM0YkB3ZWJtYWlsLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWM3MmQwZiQwY2QwNWUxMCQwYTAwYThjMEBib3Jnbm9kZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWM3MmQwZiQwY2QwNWUxMCQwYTAwYThjMEBib3Jnbm9kZT4="},"prevInTopic":27534,"nextInTopic":27536,"prevInTime":27534,"nextInTime":27536,"topicId":27532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I guess it s a good thing that you and Dave are a *united front* in deciding NOT to *mold your child* into anything, but instead to embrace Sorcha for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1136925240\">Well, I guess it&#39;s a good thing that you and Dave are a *united front* in<br/>\ndeciding NOT to *mold your child* into anything, but instead to embrace Sorcha<br/>\nfor *WHO SHE IS*...

Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed children as those who know how they want the world to be run and have no tolerance for anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The strong-willed child is very persistent and is willing to take punishment in order to win on any given issue. Because they are gifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are not always overtly defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in their attempts to control. They are willing to and capable of causing emotional upset in order to gain the upper hand. Strong-willed children don&#39;t necessarily want to control everyone around them. They just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone else. Discipline: Calm is Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes to molding a strong-willed child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and consequences. When expectations are violated, be sure to be consistent in discipline. According to Smiley, parents who cancel punishments midstream are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining strong-willed kids, control your emotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control adult is not effective and is usually counterproductive. When we (as parents) go out of control, the strong-willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s son, Aaron, a strong-willed child when growing up, claims that discipline worked best when it was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that he needed to dig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to become responsible adults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to focus, to remind themselves that they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s not your calling to be your child&#39;s &quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling and privilege to be your child&#39;s parent. With a strong-willed child, choosing battles wisely is important - but so is the corollary: Be sure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley believes that moms and dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to parenting strong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to parenting is normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and dads not disagree on parenting issues in front of the strong-willed child. The strong-willed child is very attentive to differences in how Mom and Dad handle parenting issues. As a result, parents who don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open themselves up to instances where their child will play one parent off the other in his or her efforts to gain control. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27744,"nextTopicId":27703}}
