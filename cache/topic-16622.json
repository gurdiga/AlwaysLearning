Anyone out there?  <br/>\n <br/>\nHomeschooling in NH is not nearly as free as in MI, and I&#39;m just wondering how badly I&#39;ll have to contort myself to keep unschooling.  Oddly, we&#39;re moving there to live more freely, only we&#39;ll be taking two giants steps backward with homeschooling first.  Sigh.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest will be 12 by the time we move, so it will only be a problem for a couple of years at most.  We&#39;re hoping to change that kind of thing when we get there.<br/>\n <br/>\nAppreciate any info.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
