I have shared sleep concerns before and we are still in the midst of some crazy patterns. But I am doing my best to embrace them! So she fell asleep at 8 pm in her stroller for what we thought was the night... oh no, she woke up a little before 9, wide awake and ready to go!!! oops... ;-) So I knew I had a long night ahead of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest thing is making the shift mentally to what is actually happening, from what you thought you were going to have. My husband and I were looking forward to &quot;adult&quot; time, icecream, TV, and maybe a little earlier bedtime. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead I got 4 hours of crazy playtime! Beads all over the floor, loads of imaginary friends (hyenas!), oobleck, painting, cleaning in the sink, ice cream cone at 11 pm, bath at 12:30 am, and finally asleep at 1:15 (which actually didn&#39;t seem that bad!)And once I got over my mental hurdles it was actually tons of fun :-) Most of my family and friends can&#39;t believe that of course!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just been feeling so happy and grateful for my life today and it is spilling over to the computer.... And Marisol is happy with her &quot;mini-monkey platter&quot; and her TV shows. And that is good because it is hot and sticky here! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have more happy, grateful thoughts to Unshcooling, Sandra, and all the people on this list on my blog if anyone wants to read:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crunchyconmom.xanga.com/\">http://crunchyconmom.xanga.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife has not been without its challenges lately - family, being a pregnant mama to a vivacious almost 3 yo girl etc - but mostly my life view is just so good right now, in large part to things I am learning on this list. So thanks to all!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44383,"nextTopicId":44384}}
