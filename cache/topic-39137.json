So he called me at lunch and we talked a bit. He said Im sorry Ive been really stressed about finals and afraid Im going to fail one of my classes and I am so sick of it I just want it to be done. I asked him why he kept going to school . He said because Im now 10 weeks away from finally getting my bachelors and that will hopefully get me more money in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked him ..... Getting your bach was a goal you set for yourself right? yes <br/>\nCourtney isnt getting a degree out of going to 3rd grade or doing 3rd grade lessons right? ok true  You made so many comments about all the things she was learning last year when we didnt do a single lesson right ? well yea <br/>\nJudging from the papers she broght home and the things she said was she learning anything new? he laughed ok no she wasnt it was ridiculous she was having to do things she had already learned over and over again. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is still a bit anxious because she dosent seem to want to stick with anything and I said ok imagine that you were starving and someone took you to this room full of all different kinds of food some you know you like, some you have never had before but it looks tasty what are you going to do? You can have whatever you want what are you going to do just sit and eat the pot roast or go fill your plate up with a little bit of everything that looks good? ....everything that looks good   ........ok I see where you are going with this .

She changed her mind ( wouldnt you lol?) <br/>\n<br/>\nDad gets more upset and says well she needs to pick something and stick with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe used to be a lot more supportive of unschooling so I dont get it . <br/>\n<br/>\nShe found time4learning.com and wanted me to order that so I did .i look at it as another tool she can use in addition to researching on the net, playing wow, watching tv, exploring outside, etc etc. Now he is wanting to know how many lessons she did in a day because he dosent want to waste money on it if she isnt going to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease excuse me ....
