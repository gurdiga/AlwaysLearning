I&#39;m letting go of our restrictions too and <br/>\nshowering and teeth brushing has been one of the hardest things for <br/>\nme too.  My son (6) hasn&#39;t showered for days and today when I asked <br/>\nhim if he was going to shower he said &quot;definitely&quot; (this afternoon) <br/>\nbut by the evening, he was not so definite anymore :&#39;  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nI *made* him shower exactly, I just started the shower for him and I <br/>\nturned around and he was in the bathroom.  He also brushed his teeth <br/>\ntonight totally on his own but this is after days of not brushing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like Pam&#39;s thoughts on that maybe for them, this is just not a <br/>\nconcern yet and as they get older they will be more inclined to smell <br/>\nnice and have fresh mouths.  I&#39;m just now thinking that in <br/>\nthe &quot;olden&quot; days people didn&#39;t shower daily and it&#39;s really our <br/>\nsociety that makes such a big deal of daily showering.  I have been <br/>\nmaking a point to brush my teeth when they are in the bathroom with <br/>\nme and showering when he is still awake to kind of be an example. In <br/>\nthe meantime, I&#39;m going to get some gum with xylitol and work on not <br/>\nmaking showering an issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nnatalie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robyn L.

I mean, sure  &quot;clean&quot;, but <br/>\nhow dirty can one be and not smell? My 9 year old isn&#39;t much  interested in <br/>\nshowering or bathing right now and he isn&#39;t often dirty.  Sometimes, he <br/>\nremembers how much he likes climbing into bed clean from the  shower and will ask for <br/>\nhelp getting the water the right temperature. (He hasn&#39;t  yet asked for me to <br/>\nget him a towel or clean clothes, but I like to make sure he  has those things <br/>\nwhen he gets out, so I get them together for him-and turn on  the heater if <br/>\nit&#39;s necessary.) Once a week would be *extremely* often, here.  Once a month or <br/>\nevery 3 weeks is more the norm.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest loves baths and will sometimes take 3 in a day. He  doesn&#39;t wash <br/>\nmuch (though he&#39;s recently taken to using a washcloth while in  there), but I <br/>\nfigure that the bubbles he likes me to pour in, combined with  the sloshing <br/>\nabout he does in there gets him pretty clean. He looks clean and he  doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstink.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest has *finally* started brushing his teeth on his  own! Since he <br/>\nstarted using the bathroom recently (still haven&#39;t gotten rid  of the diapers, <br/>\nsince he seems to want to make sure they&#39;re still around),  every once in a <br/>\nwhile, he&#39;ll get out his brush and put toothpaste on it and  scrub his teeth-then <br/>\nhe&#39;ll come announce it to the rest of the family. *That*  was a long time <br/>\ncoming, because I had a hard time letting go of my insistence  that his teeth get <br/>\nbrushed. I now know I&#39;ve finally gotten rid of my anxiety  about it, because <br/>\nnow he is casual and relaxed about it!<br/>\n <br/>\nEven I can go with washing my hair only twice a week (on rare  occasions, <br/>\nonce a week), but usually ends up being 2 1/2 to 3 times a week, on  average. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t shower every day unless I get dirty all over or  get stinky/sweaty, or am <br/>\nhot and want to cool off before bed. In the hot,  humid part of the summer, I <br/>\ncan easily shower every day and occasionally twice a  day, but in the winter, <br/>\nnot nearly so much. There&#39;s a lot to be said for  sponge baths in-between <br/>\nshowering/bathing, too. Funny, though... I still  can&#39;t bring myself to skip <br/>\ntooth brushing, myself. I can be almost completely  asleep and suddenly remember I <br/>\nhad forgotten to brush my teeth... no matter how  tired I am, I cannot get <br/>\nback to sleep without getting up (no matter how cold  that hardwood floor is!), <br/>\ncooling off the bed and brushing my teeth!
