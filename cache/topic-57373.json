My dd went<br/>\nto a sleepover party with ten girls.  They had fun and played some pranks,<br/>\nmost of which were harmless.  One of the pranks ended up not being quite so<br/>\nharmless however, and my dd was right in the middle of it, though several of<br/>\nthe girls were involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n It involved a prank phone call that was not very nice to a girl that some<br/>\nof the other girls at the party knew, but that my dd did not know. (this was<br/>\nthe first time she had met two of the girls who go to an expensive private<br/>\nschool) Unbeknownst to my dd, the reason for the call was based in jealousy<br/>\nand the unkindness was not a joke.  The girl who received the prank call,<br/>\nwhich was mean,  but was not threatening in any way, had previously received<br/>\na threatening call from another group of girls, which included a girl at<br/>\nthis party; the girl whose idea it was to make the call. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when it all shook out, the mom of the girl who receive the prank<br/>\ncall, called the home where the party was, and threatened to call the police<br/>\nand the host of the party called the parents of all the kids at the party.<br/>\nIt was the morning after the sleepover.  When I arrived the house was full<br/>\nof crying teenagers and upset parents.  When the host mom asked who had made<br/>\nthe call, my dd immediately spoke up and took the blame.  The host mom knew<br/>\nthat my dd did not know the girl who was called but that some other girls<br/>\ndid.  My daughter was the ONLY girl who spoke up and took the blame for the<br/>\nincident even when put under a fair amount of pressure.  The other few girls<br/>\nthat were directly involved looked ridiculous while trying to avoid the<br/>\nblame. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents were all upset and didn&#39;t seem to know what to do so I took it<br/>\ninto my own hands and asked for a phone and a private place to make a call.<br/>\nMy dd and I called the family and talked at length with the girl who<br/>\nreceived the call and her mom.  They accepted my dd&#39;s apology and were very<br/>\ngracious.  They understood that my dd got caught up in the moment and that<br/>\nshe was not behind the meanness that was intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did what we could to make it right and we both felt better after talking<br/>\nwith the daughter and the mom.  The police were not called, though I was not<br/>\nworried if they had been.  I have to say I wondered how the parents of my<br/>\nkids&#39; friends would react once it all shook out and my daughter was the one<br/>\nat fault for executing the plan.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTo my surprise, they (the two moms whose opinions I care about) were very<br/>\npleased with my dd because she was honest and forthright when confronted.<br/>\nThey did not place the blame solely on my dd and in fact, they felt that<br/>\nmore of the blame was lying in the lap of the girl whose idea it was in the<br/>\nfirst place.  I was very pleased that in the end they only saw the good<br/>\nmoral character of my dd shining forth and they have been great about<br/>\nletting our kids hang out together since then. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57402,"nextTopicId":57371}}
