I have always been an unschooler in my heart and soul, but never was able to do it until now.   I have been one to always point out a full harvest moon, turn off the heeadlights and marvel at being able to drive with no headlights.  In Vermont we would see the road ensconsed in clouds, open all the windows  and drive up to see the house the same way. BUT I was the mom who pointed out the learning aspects, science facts trying to make my kids as smart as possible.  I was not the mom I am now, in stage one of deschooling, learning to let us all be who we are.  Before I was all lip service, words but no substance.  Now I am both.  What a wonderful message for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to fit in to everyone elses life was far too difficult for me and draining. I was crabby all the time.  I am so much happier this way.  I still have dreams (as I did last night) that we were meeting with my aunts and cousins (all educators) and I had to defend ourselves on the road we&#39;ve embarked on.  Then another dream where I was doing the same with my angry and sarcastic father.  Obviously I am still fighting battles where none have to exist, and that will slowly cease.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour essay  hit home.  It was wonderful.  Thank You.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarole in CT  (continuing to deschool for as long as it takes).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!
