He&#39;s bright and talented and <br/>\ninto reptiles and baseball.  The homeschool Zoo Academy is coming up in <br/>\nFebruary, which he is incredibly excited about.  The problem is they <br/>\nsent a &quot;pre-activity&quot; along with the registration confirmation.  For <br/>\nsome reason I put him in 2nd grade, not thinking...Anyway, the <br/>\npre-activity was to write two sentences using each vocabulary word and <br/>\nto fill in the blanks on a set of animal descriptions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Zoo Academy is going to be like this, it might just ruin everything <br/>\nfor him.  He doesn&#39;t understand the school paradigm at all.  He didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow what fill in the blank was.  He didn&#39;t even register what a <br/>\nsentence was (but I know he knows it in another context).  He picked up <br/>\nthe fill in the blanks thing and answered all the questions correctly. <br/>\n (big whoop)  And as soon as I told him he could type the sentences, he <br/>\nwas eager to do them.  It took him a long time to do one set of <br/>\nsentences.  (Of course, he wrote one sentence for each word and plans to <br/>\nwrite a second set with each word, which is what a person in school <br/>\nwould know is the &quot;wrong&quot; way.)  Some of his sentences do not make sense <br/>\n(ie., A bat is echolocation.--he learned how to do the &quot;underline the <br/>\nvocabulary word&quot; part on the computer.  lol.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to let him know that there is a <br/>\nchance his sentences will not fit their mold, will be odd to them--you <br/>\nfolks know what I mean...I&#39;m afraid someone will say something to him <br/>\nabout his abilities (I&#39;m afraid it will be another homeschooler, too. <br/>\n:P).  And that the Zoo Academy is going to have more writing than last <br/>\nyear.  These are other homeschoolers, but not unschoolers (I guarantee <br/>\nit).  And the zoo staff won&#39;t get it either.  I won&#39;t tell him it&#39;s time <br/>\nfor him to learn to write &quot;properly&quot; before he gets to Zoo Academy. My <br/>\nnatural reaction is to volunteer for the class (they only allow two <br/>\nparents), and he wants me there.  I could run interference for him if I <br/>\nwere there.  But I didn&#39;t get a volunteer form with my registration (I&#39;m <br/>\ncalling tomorrow to volunteer, of course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a responsive kid and I can see that he could fall either way on <br/>\nthis issue.  There has already been some frustration with the writing <br/>\nand the sentences.  Either the week will cause him to get completely <br/>\nfrustrated, or it could be a spark that leads him into his next phase of <br/>\nliteracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need a pep talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85171455,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] He is happening","postDate":"1007441978","msgId":250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMxN2M4MCQ3YTNkOTk4MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjMwMWMxN2M3OSQ1ODg1NDJlMCQ0ZWE2YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":249,"nextInTopic":251,"prevInTime":249,"nextInTime":251,"topicId":247,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Great story Julie, and funny!
