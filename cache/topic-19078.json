I guess this one depends on whether it is a food intolerance or a food allergy.  Food intolerances can be overcome, sometimes with just a break from the food in question for 3 months.  Whereas food allergies can be a lifelong problem.  I would be interested though to check out products that are reputed to help the body overcome allergies!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nMumto5kidz  :D<br/>\nliving in New Zealand <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

We know, it&#39;s been<br/>\ndocumented, that we are changing our chemical makeup,<br/>\naffecting our own and other species with chemicals, so<br/>\nit should be no great surprise, nor very mysterious<br/>\nthat kids are more chemically sensative and their<br/>\nnervous systems are more defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I agree with Sandra.  There is a<br/>\ncurrent cultural fad to drug healthy, normal children<br/>\ninto little drones, which is just more chemicals which<br/>\nare affecting their later physical and mental health<br/>\nin scary ways that we are only beginning to<br/>\nunderstand.  People also seem to be reacting to this<br/>\nincrease in physically defensive reactions by getting<br/>\nhysterical about allergies.  As the mother of a child<br/>\nwho is extremely chemically sensative and whose child<br/>\nhas nearly died from anaphylactic shock after rushing<br/>\nhim into the ER, not once, not twice, but three times,<br/>\nfor three different foods, I think I can say I have a<br/>\nlittle experience with allergies.  Everyone in our<br/>\nfamily has them to some degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously we hear all about all the different<br/>\ndeprivation style diets and their magical results. <br/>\nYes my son has a number of foods that affect him<br/>\nchemically/emotionally too.  Some of them cause rages<br/>\nor just downright snarly nasty behaviors, or extreme<br/>\nmanic hyperactivity, sometimes for days.  We obviously<br/>\nhave to keep foods that are physically dangerous to<br/>\nhim out of his diet, but those which cause mood<br/>\nswings, hyperactivity, hives, headaches, stomach aches<br/>\netc, are not physically dangerous, just uncomfortable<br/>\nand/or annoying.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s no challenge to keep him from eating things which<br/>\ncause overt reactions like vomiting or worse.  He&#39;s<br/>\nnot stupid.  But we choose not to be what we call &quot;the<br/>\nfood nazis&quot; if you&#39;ll forgive the expression, when it<br/>\ncomes to the less dangerous reactions.  We will remind<br/>\nhim when he is about to eat a food which we know will<br/>\nlikely cause some reactions, but we don&#39;t stop him. <br/>\nWe just want him to be prepared for the consequences<br/>\nof eating it.  We try to help him through the<br/>\naftermath, and be patient with him while not allowing<br/>\nhim to abuse us just because he chose to eat something<br/>\nwhich affects his judgement or self control.  We feel<br/>\nthat he will never be able to learn to manage his diet<br/>\nand allergies or make good food choices without being<br/>\nable to experiment, make mistakes and learn why a<br/>\ncertain food is not fun for him to eat, even if it<br/>\ntastes good.  We tell our kids to listen to their<br/>\nbodies, but how could they do that if we told them how<br/>\nto feel all the time and strictly controlled what they<br/>\nate?  <br/>\n  <br/>\nWe also know that his body is not a static thing.  He<br/>\nmay be able to handle a food allergen if he has not<br/>\nhad it in a while, or he doesn&#39;t have a lot of other<br/>\npotential problem foods in his system at the same<br/>\ntime, or he is not processing environmental allergies<br/>\n(like his severe dog allergy) at the same time, or<br/>\nhe&#39;s not overtired, sick, on a growth spurt or in some<br/>\nother way overly taxed physically.  It&#39;s hard to say<br/>\nat any given time whether he will be ok, or have a<br/>\nreaction to the milder allergies.  We also do things<br/>\nto help him process allergens, supplements to help his<br/>\nliver and kidneys work more efficiently, and replacing<br/>\nminerals and other things used up in processing toxins<br/>\n(for him) so that his body is better able to handle<br/>\nthem.  If he&#39;s eating more things that can cause him<br/>\nproblems, we encourage him to step up the preventive<br/>\nmeasure that help him to process them, so he can avoid<br/>\nthe problems and still live how he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way we don&#39;t have to live on a restricting<br/>\ndiet, he can still have cake and ice cream at a<br/>\nbirthday party or dinner at grandma&#39;s without having<br/>\nto have all his own special food, and most<br/>\nimportantly, he doesn&#39;t feel forced or coerced into<br/>\ngiving up the foods he loves at home, if he is willing<br/>\nto pay the price for eating them.  He tends to avoid<br/>\nthings that cause him to rage and lose control of<br/>\nhimself and act monstrous, because he doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nfeeling out of control or burning up with anger or<br/>\nhaving everyone upset with him.  But he had to learn<br/>\nthat by having the choice and living the aftermath,<br/>\nmany times.  He doesn&#39;t learn very readily from cause<br/>\nand effect, so it took a while for it to sink in for<br/>\nhim, but it did.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19134,"nextTopicId":19146}}
