Its amazing what other <br/>\nfolks will buy. If nothing else you can cycle though your wardrobes each <br/>\nyear and sell at the resale shops what you did not wear the year <br/>\nbefore...resale is also a great way to buy  clothes.<br/>\nCan you ask family to give the boys &quot;extras&quot; as birthday and Christmas <br/>\npresents next year?

What do you do for <br/>\nthe non-profit? Could you do that for others who in turn could provide <br/>\nyou with services you might need? I know my &quot;only&quot; child would enjoy a <br/>\nweekly visit from another kid...you might find a mom who needs to switch <br/>\noff days for a job. For that matter I have heard of single moms <br/>\n&quot;sharing&quot; a house as a way to make ends meet...if you can find someone <br/>\nwho fits into you and your kids lifestyle. Rent a room to a college student?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could think of other things......<br/>\nWe live on less then what you did, but I don&#39;t know what we would do if <br/>\ndh died.

So at some point, we&#39;ve got to deal with requirements, even if <br/>\nour school district is relaxed this year (doubtful -- but I do know my <br/>\nrights). I don&#39;t want to do any of this stuff. I don&#39;t want to make <br/>\nanyone do anything. I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; anything. I want us to just <br/>\nlive our lives, read whatever, do what it seems other unschoolers do: <br/>\nfind sparks and run with them. Like we used to when they were littler.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;re kind of not like that part. We find sparks and like them just <br/>\nfor being sparks, and the depth part never happens. And we&#39;re getting <br/>\nto ages where the depth part starts being part of the picture. We&#39;ve <br/>\ngot loads of depth in literature and &quot;social studies&quot; quite naturally <br/>\nby our interests. So that brings us back to how to interact with &quot;the <br/>\nsubject of science&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I haven&#39;t broken any written or unwritten codes by posting such <br/>\na long query. Thanks so much just for reading all the way through it! <br/>\nAny input would be welcome, though I definitely am not looking for <br/>\ncriticism!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21378,"nextTopicId":21406}}
