The pit where the bonfire<br/>\nwas is down from the parking lot and walkway, so Rowan would see people<br/>\npausing uncertainly at the edge, dash up the stairs, introduce himself, ask<br/>\nthem if they were hungry, and then direct them to the goodness on the BBQ<br/>\nand the potluck table, pointing out his favorites along the way. Then once<br/>\nthey were talking to an adult, he&#39;d run back up the stairs to watch for more<br/>\npeople. Once the stream of newcomers died down, he began circulating, making<br/>\nsure people had had a chance to throw wood on the fire (he&#39;d gotten the idea<br/>\nit was good luck to do so), and just generally exuding hospitality.

We&#39;d asked people to bring some<br/>\nsort of dessert item to share, above and beyond the bag-o-candy default, and<br/>\nthey outdid themselves. There were crockpots of chili and bowls of salads<br/>\nand chips and breads and cakes and pies and cookies and tarts and just an<br/>\namazing array of &quot;the good stuff&quot;. Kestrel would toddle over, ask for help<br/>\ngetting a cookie or whatever, take it back to his seat, eat it with intense<br/>\nfocus, toddle back over, try something new. Sometimes he&#39;d see people reach<br/>\nfor something, and announce loudly &quot;Oh, that&#39;s yummy! You want that!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Rowan, as we were heading to bed once it was all over, if it was fun<br/>\nfor him, or if he&#39;d have rather done the dress up, house-to-house thing.

They would tell them about their costumes and<br/>\n&gt;  introduce themselves. They would linger at each door and just chat<br/>\n&gt;  while the other kids in the neighborhood would zoom up to the door,<br/>\n&gt;  barely utter &quot;thanks&quot; and rush to the next house. I see this as a<br/>\n&gt;  pattern in other areas of our lives as well. They talk to waitresses<br/>\n&gt;  and store clerks and other parents. I credit this to the fact that<br/>\n&gt;  they&#39;ve never been trained to view adults as distant authority figures<br/>\n&gt;  at the front of some classroom or that they are not supposed to engage<br/>\n&gt;  with adults other than when they raise their hand to ask a question.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I love this about our kids. The other day we were at our weekly park<br/>\n&gt;  day and my 9 year old was having the greatest conversation with another<br/>\n&gt;  mom about his new Tamagatchi. She was sharing tricks and ideas about<br/>\n&gt;  her own experiences and generally just enjoying his company,<br/>\n&gt;  enthusiastic about his new passion. It never occurred to him that this<br/>\n&gt;  was out-of-the-ordinary. It has just been his experience in life.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  This is the kind of benefit from unschooling that can be taken for<br/>\n&gt;  granted sometimes. But really, when it comes right down to it, it&#39;s one<br/>\n&gt;  of the greatest and most important reasons why I unschool. For my<br/>\n&gt;  children to know that their ideas and passions are important and worthy<br/>\n&gt;  - even to an adult - will serve them so much more than if they ever know<br/>\n&gt;  algebra or how to diagram a sentence. In fact, those things can be<br/>\n&gt;  learned in a relatively short time period. However, the belief that<br/>\n&gt;  their passions and ideas are insignificant to adults and that they must<br/>\n&gt;  always look outside of themselves for direction and approval - following<br/>\n&gt;  a course that has pre-ordained by an authority figure - just might never<br/>\n&gt;  be unlearned.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Here&#39;s to trick-or-treat-and-talking!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Sunday<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschoolers and Trick-or-Treating","postDate":"1193947024","msgId":31221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyRTZGMTgzLUY5ODEtNERDOC1CMUFDLTJFRjRGMDU0NTAyNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0YjczZGQwYzNiMTU2NzZlNGJmYzY2OTRiMzJmZDRiQGNveC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwYzcwMWM4MWNhMiQ0YThmNjNkMCQ2ODAxYThjMEBEMTZWNDk0MT4gPGU0YjczZGQwYzNiMTU2NzZlNGJmYzY2OTRiMzJmZDRiQGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":31220,"nextInTopic":31223,"prevInTime":31220,"nextInTime":31223,"topicId":31212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-When my kids were maybe 11 and 8, we were visiting the natural history museum s dinosaur exhibit.

Alex, the younger kid, was chatting up the <br/>\ndocent, telling him all about other aspects of the particular dinosaur, <br/>\nstuff he&#39;d read and learned on TV, etc.  The docent looked up at me as <br/>\nAlex trotted off to the next exhibit and said, &quot;Homeschooled, right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I met a homeschooled teenager was at the first <br/>\nconference/seminar I ever attended.  My kids were still pretty young <br/>\nand I was still pretty unsure.  This young man introduced himself, <br/>\nasked how I was enjoying the conference, looked me straight in the eye, <br/>\nwas actually interested in the answer and in pursuing the conversation. <br/>\n  Up till then, I&#39;d never had a conversation with a teen who didn&#39;t look <br/>\nat the ground the whole time.
