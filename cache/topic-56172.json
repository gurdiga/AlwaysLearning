He has such great little thoughtful moments. I like taking note<br/>\nof them and storing them up for good memories. He knows how to write<br/>\ndown separate letters of the alphabet but since he&#39;s not a fluent<br/>\nreader yet he often dictates notes and stories and draws pictures with<br/>\nthem. I have a lot of notes and stickers Karl has given me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one on the refrigerator that says: &quot;Dear Mommy, I just wanted<br/>\nyou to have this so you can be happy&quot; with a smiley face he drew<br/>\nhimself. He asked me to write it down for a note he wanted me to have,<br/>\nand then he put it on the refrigerator.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in church today, to keep him interested during a longish music<br/>\nconcert (the whole service worth) by some very wonderful accomplished<br/>\nmusicians, all three of us .... me, Brian and Karl .... drew a picture<br/>\non the blank back of the program sheet. He drew a boy (himself), Brian<br/>\ndrew his clothes, Karl drew our dog (great picture of Katie), I drew a<br/>\ncat (unfortunately not OUR cat but serendipitously a Siamese cat),<br/>\nKarl drew the dog leash, a soccer ball, the sun, a bolt or ray coming<br/>\nfrom the sun (and later he said lightening is just a flash that comes<br/>\nfrom God&#39;s eye -- I was like &quot;wow! how like Zeus&quot;), I drew a hula<br/>\nhoop, a tree, a flower. It was drawn to the music. Hopefully I&#39;ll get<br/>\naround to blogging it this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling to me is about developing and noticing the relationships<br/>\nbetween people that are developing in the family for years... while<br/>\nthey&#39;re happening. And not letting those things slip away unnoticed.<br/>\nIt&#39;s about nurturing such things. And enjoying them as they happen.<br/>\nLiving in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Jul 18, 2010 at 2:49 PM, Lauren Stranahan<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrsstranahan@...\">mrsstranahan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Earlier in the week I went to bed with one kitchen counter really cluttered<br/>\n&gt; up with stuff and crumbs. I woke up to a clean counter with the fruit and my<br/>\n&gt; teas all organized nicely and the crumbs wiped off.

Recently I work up<br/>\n&gt; to a note on the refrigerator that said, &quot;Make muffins.&quot; So before she got<br/>\n&gt; up for the day I made some banana chocolate chip muffins. I melted the<br/>\n&gt; butter in the microwave and forgot to add it to the muffins. I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; realize I&#39;d left it out until after they were baking. The muffins were good<br/>\n&gt; enough .. we ate them all.. they were just a little solid and dense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The next morning I woke up and my 9 yr old son had added to Olivia&#39;s muffin<br/>\n&gt; note .. It said, &quot;Add butter!!!&quot; So I made more. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My mom has been telling me for a couple years now that the kids are old<br/>\n&gt; enough to have chores.
