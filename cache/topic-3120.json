I&#39;d have no <br/>\n  problem saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think people enrolled in &#39;The Learning Center&#39; are <br/>\n  really homeschooling. They&#39;re really more in school than out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m saying that just being signed up for a public school program doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\n  that that is the way it will be. There are many different kinds of public <br/>\n  school programs and that includes the AEPs in Washingington. Some are MUCH <br/>\n  looser than many private cover schools. There are public school programs that <br/>\n  encourage unschooling - I once went to an excellent workshop that ENCOURAGED <br/>\n  unschooling at our county&#39;s public school program. There are public school <br/>\n  programs where people only see somebody from that program once a year or <br/>\n  twice a year or every three months or even never at all. There are public <br/>\n  school programs where they have drop-in centers that offer workshops and the <br/>\n  people can use them or not, as they wish. There are a b&#39;zillion different <br/>\n  kinds of programs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So - if you want to look at what one family is doing or what one particular <br/>\n  program requires, and say &quot;That isn&#39;t really homeschooling,&quot; based on what <br/>\n  they are REALLY doing -- fine. But these people in Washington are insisting <br/>\n  that it is &quot;in black and white&quot; and we should all just accept what the law <br/>\n  says. They aren&#39;t looking at what people are really doing, individually. They <br/>\n  aren&#39;t interested in the difference between different programs. They are just <br/>\n  saying that their LAW distinguishes between families in AEPs versus &quot;real&quot; <br/>\n  homeschoolers and they want to keep that distinction and they get extremely <br/>\n  heated up over it when people aren&#39;t willing to maintain that distinction. <br/>\n  There are people in that state who have really been hurt and driven away from <br/>\n  the rest of the homeschooling community by this extremely rigid thinking <br/>\n  which is repeated over and over. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been in a public school program and I was just as much a homeschooler <br/>\n  then as I am now. We started unschooling while in a public school program, <br/>\n  after experimenting with doing unit studies for a while. We saw the program <br/>\n  staff person ONCE, when we signed up. They didn&#39;t tell us what to do, they <br/>\n  offered materials and workshops and some field trips and a park day, that we <br/>\n  could use IF we wanted to use them. We have board members of the National <br/>\n  Home Education Network who are in public school programs and they are not <br/>\n  only homeschooling, they are unschoolers. Shall we kick them off the board, <br/>\n  telling them they aren&#39;t &quot;real homeschoolers&quot; because they&#39;re enrolled in a <br/>\n  public school program?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichoel, I&#39;ve been involved in this discussion for the past 6 years and I&#39;ve <br/>\n  read all the statutes. In fact, by quoting all the statutes, you&#39;re just <br/>\n  emphasizing my point that you want to let the law define who is a <br/>\n  homeschooler.  WHY would we homeschoolers want to let the government define <br/>\n  who is and who isn&#39;t a homeschooler? Some of the most prominent homeschoolers <br/>\n  in the State of Washington are underground and would not be called <br/>\n  homeschoolers according to your own statutes, in fact they&#39;d technically be <br/>\n  called &quot;criminals&quot; since they are breaking the law. Do you insist that they <br/>\n  not call themselves homeschoolers since they aren&#39;t, legally, operating under <br/>\n  the actual homeschooling statutes?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t object to looking at the programs and talking about the problems with <br/>\n  them and the problems that could be created in the homeschooling community by <br/>\n  them and so on. I don&#39;t object to looking at a particular program and saying, <br/>\n  &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like homeschooling to me when they have to be there and have <br/>\n  to work on somebody else&#39;s schedule and have to do what somebody else <br/>\n  requires,&quot; and so on. That&#39;s based on reality, not on what the LAW defines. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I very very strongly object to the argument that the LAW defines some people <br/>\n  as homeschoolers and other people as not homeschoolers and that we should all <br/>\n  support that definition. It flies in the face of reality and requires us to <br/>\n  deny our own observations. There are radical unschoolers who are enrolled in <br/>\n  public school programs - and there are people in Washington State telling <br/>\n  THEM that they don&#39;t have the right to call themselves real homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I find it disheartening that there are homeschoolers who so adamantly <br/>\n  continue to argue that we should all call ourselves exactly what the <br/>\n  government says we should call ourselves without giving any consideration to <br/>\n  what people are REALLY doing. WHY should we let the law define who is and who <br/>\n  isn&#39;t a real homeschooler? I&#39;m discouraged that people don&#39;t think about the <br/>\n  further ramifications of that kind of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I&#39;ve already repeated myself on this too much on this already and I&#39;m <br/>\n  sure it is getting tedious and I promise I will resist doing it again if I <br/>\n  have nothing new to say &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
