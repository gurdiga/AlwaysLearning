But I  <br/>\nstarted being aware of my thoughts and attitudes and found that I  <br/>\ncould choose what to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople whose thoughts wash over them, as mine did when I was young,  <br/>\nlike to think they have no choice, that they ARE unhappy.   My dad  <br/>\ntold me, when I was a teen, that I could choose to be happy.  I wish  <br/>\nI had said &quot;What do you mean?&quot; and let him talk to me for a while,  <br/>\ninstead of bursting into tears and saying &quot;That&#39;s STUPID&quot; and running  <br/>\nto my room.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I am, as usual, not talking about the first post or the issue  <br/>\noriginally brought up, but something connected, as all things are.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking how glad I was (this morning) to have enough spoons  <br/>\nthat we wouldn&#39;t run out of clean ones if I waited until morning to  <br/>\ndo the dishes.  I thought that I was glad we still had the plastic  <br/>\ncup Kirby likes so much from when he was little, that he still  <br/>\nchooses first, at the age of 19.  I like the enamelled steel  <br/>\ncasserole dish we&#39;ve had for over 20 years, that I got at the grocery  <br/>\nstore at one of those promotions where a different baking piece is on  <br/>\nsale each week.  I think we paid $7 or $8 for it.   I use it ever  <br/>\nweek.  We have two smaller bowls that match it, which can be used to  <br/>\nbake bread in, or as serving bowls.  And we have a skillet with a  <br/>\nlid.   They have flowers on the sides.   We couldn&#39;t afford  <br/>\neverything they had in that series, and we sacrificed to get those we  <br/>\ngot, because we were young and all that.  Tomorrow is our 21st  <br/>\nwedding anniversary, and we were together six years before that.  Now  <br/>\nwe could afford a set of enamelware, but I couldn&#39;t buy something  <br/>\nthat we&#39;d had for 20 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings you get at a grocery store now might seem sweet and peaceful  <br/>\nto you in twenty years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *could* also have thought mean and irritating thoughts this  <br/>\nmorning.  Kirby didn&#39;t rinse his milk glass.  Someone else could have  <br/>\ndone the dishes last night, but Marty went to bed early so he could  <br/>\ngo to work early, and Kirby had a D&D game.  Holly was excited about  <br/>\nsome new photos she had taken of her newly-dyed hair, and was working  <br/>\non MySpace.  So I thought of what fun and fun they had had the night  <br/>\nbefore, while I cleaned the kitchen, while my tea was brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure some people think it&#39;s easy for me to say &quot;calm&quot; because my  <br/>\nkids are teens.  But there are parents of three teens who spend a lot  <br/>\nof energy nagging, fighting, pressuring and punishing.  We came to  <br/>\nthis calm from conscious direction and work.   And short of adoption  <br/>\nor remarriage, people don&#39;t suddenly have three teens.  When Holly  <br/>\nwas born, Kirby was five. Marty was three.  I was already working on  <br/>\nbeing a gentle parent.   If people take away the less gentle parts of  <br/>\nmodern family life and replace them with more gentle choices, life is  <br/>\nmore gentle already.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152462241,"authorName":"katherand2003","from":"&quot;katherand2003&quot; &lt;katherand2003@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: conference Maisha","postDate":"1143693191","msgId":25009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwZm4yNys5NG1xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVISUNJQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":25004,"nextInTopic":25011,"prevInTime":25008,"nextInTime":25010,"topicId":24910,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ooooo Jackie.

We&#39;ve unschooled with the label for almost 4 years, and<br/>\n&gt; without the label for a few years before that. Our budget has varied<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; below the poverty level to times of financial wealth. In any of<br/>\nthose times,<br/>\n&gt; we have just put the information out there to the whole family.<br/>\n&quot;This month<br/>\n&gt; we have about $500 for food, what do you want to do?&quot; Ideas vary all the<br/>\n&gt; time, but it is always a sure thing that we have an agreed upon plan<br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt; end. And I often have little to do with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes we have plenty of money and I just ask what people want<br/>\nbefore I<br/>\n&gt; go to the store. Sometimes people will get a list going on their own and<br/>\n&gt; give it to me or post it. Sometimes I go to the grocery store twice in a<br/>\n&gt; day, or three or more times in a week. It just depends on the time<br/>\nand the<br/>\n&gt; needs and the wants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes we label food so that food that particular people pick out<br/>\nspecial<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t eaten by someone else by mistake. We&#39;ve had almost no problem with<br/>\n&gt; people eating someone else&#39;s labeled food or portion...everyone respects<br/>\n&gt; everyone else&#39;s stuff. That comes with unschooling in general...everyone<br/>\n&gt; feels respected and in turn respects others and their stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So for the food portion of your question, I would suggest sharing<br/>\nall the<br/>\n&gt; information and talking about it together. If you take yourself out<br/>\nof the<br/>\n&gt; control seat, the group will probably direct you on how to spend the<br/>\nfood<br/>\n&gt; money just fine. You of course have your own food choices to add<br/>\ninto the<br/>\n&gt; mix.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would also suggest that as much as possible the situation is set up so<br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t control others&#39; food intake. If things are labeled in<br/>\na way<br/>\n&gt; that everyone can understand, that should take you out of that arena<br/>\npretty<br/>\n&gt; much. If someone wants to eat more than you think they should<br/>\nportion out,<br/>\n&gt; give them the information about them eating the whole thing in one<br/>\nsitting,<br/>\n&gt; and let them decide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People share their &quot;special&quot; foods with others pretty regularly<br/>\naround here.<br/>\n&gt; That is always a beautiful thing to see. Even if we can&#39;t buy everything<br/>\n&gt; everyone wanted, we all still feel like we have an abundance. That comes<br/>\n&gt; from being listened to, and being part of the decision-making<br/>\nprocess, and<br/>\n&gt; having control. We feel contentedly full.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 12 yo son wanted a new video game when we were at Universal<br/>\nStudios. I<br/>\n&gt; had about $20 that I could spend on it...the rest was for gas and<br/>\nfood. He<br/>\n&gt; wanted one that just came out...it was $50. I literally took the<br/>\ncash out of<br/>\n&gt; my pocket and we counted together. I never said no. We thought<br/>\nquietly for a<br/>\n&gt; moment. Then he said, &quot;Do you think that Grammie will lend me $30 if<br/>\nI pay<br/>\n&gt; her back from my money when we get home?&quot; She was with us and my<br/>\nanswer was,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know...you want me to ask?&quot; He asked her himself, she said yes<br/>\n&gt; (even though she struggles with the unlimited video game playing) and he<br/>\n&gt; bought the game. He was SOO happy. He kept hugging us and thanking<br/>\nus...for<br/>\n&gt; hours! As soon as we got home, he paid her back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He felt full...full of love, full of appreciation, full of<br/>\nabundance. Even<br/>\n&gt; though it wasn&#39;t an automatic easy purchase.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as &quot;all those folks running around&quot; state above, it is the<br/>\nlife we<br/>\n&gt; chose. It is work to make sure that you are paying attention to what<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s experiences are each day, to be watchful for their<br/>\nindividual tastes<br/>\n&gt; and needs, while you are tending the whole group. This may be more<br/>\nwork than<br/>\n&gt; a family with one or two kids, but that doesn&#39;t matter. You may have to<br/>\n&gt; expand yourself beyond what others do, but it&#39;s just your job. The<br/>\nquestion<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;how do you handle ru...&quot; makes me think that you are &quot;handling&quot;<br/>\nthings<br/>\n&gt; rather than living life happily. Can you think of this very active<br/>\ntime as<br/>\n&gt; enjoyable? I think that would make a big difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have felt very s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with the activity of our lives at<br/>\ntimes,<br/>\n&gt; but then I remember it is just a feeling. It can be released like every<br/>\n&gt; other feeling so that I can be completely present in this moment with<br/>\n&gt; whomever I am with, in joy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids are older now and I rather be with them than anyone else in the<br/>\n&gt; world. I SO enjoy being with them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to share more about this but have to go.

I don&#39;t want our downstairs neighbors to  <br/>\n&gt; complain about the noise.  3 complaints and we get booted out.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My question would be to ask why are the kids screaming and stomping  <br/>\nand jumping inside? We go outside for that kind of play. If they get  <br/>\nloud, I note aloud that things are getting wild and ask if they want  <br/>\nto get somewhere that&#39;s it&#39;s easier to burn energy. Then we head  <br/>\noutside. The kids know that too much noise makes it hard for anyone  <br/>\nto hear someone else, so they are pretty considerate of that.  <br/>\nSometimes they just need to be loud! Another idea is to make good  <br/>\nfriends with your neighbor. Social capital is a good thing for  <br/>\nanyone, and by getting to know them, they are a lot more  <br/>\nunderstanding. Ask them what times of the day they&#39;re home, when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re gone, just be sure to tell them that you want to make living  <br/>\nunderneath you easier! It really worked well when we were in  <br/>\napartments. That way when the neighbors are at work or something, you  <br/>\ncan plan to instigate some noisy rambunctiousness.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And what about little things like the food budget?  I don&#39;t mind my  <br/>\n&gt; kids eating what they want - that&#39;s how I grew up.  I just don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; know how I can afford a food bill that is more than my rent!  And  <br/>\n&gt; with 7 ppl in a house, it can easily be more than $1000.  So I end  <br/>\n&gt; up having to tell them that they can&#39;t eat all of such-and-such  <br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s not in the budget to buy anymore.  Or, once it&#39;s all  <br/>\n&gt; gone there won&#39;t be anymore.  And I don&#39;t like having to do that.   <br/>\n&gt; I just don&#39;t know how to get around that particular issue.  Food is  <br/>\n&gt; expensive.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m much help with the food. We have two kids with  <br/>\nsevere food allergies. They have their own bins with food that is  <br/>\njust for them. The other kids understand that. They&#39;ve seen their  <br/>\nsiblings get very ill on other foods, and want to make their lives  <br/>\neasier by not eating that food. WHen you can&#39;t have wheat or corn, it  <br/>\nreally limits what you can have store-bought, so I guess that they&#39;re  <br/>\nfine with leaving those for the two.<br/>\nWhat I can suggest is getting a club card. We shop at Sam&#39;s. WHile  <br/>\nit&#39;s not always a deal, it really can help with most of it. We aren&#39;t  <br/>\nspending money that other people would, by breast-feeding and using  <br/>\ncloth products. We don&#39;t&#39; usually buy name brand anything. We buy  <br/>\ncases of meat, because it&#39;s a lot cheaper by the pound. We joined a  <br/>\nfood coop. And always include the kids in budgeting and shopping. If  <br/>\nyou talk with them about how much money you have and what bills have  <br/>\nto be paid, they&#39;re pretty cool about making choices that benefit  <br/>\neveryone. At the beginning of the month, we pay all the bills, and  <br/>\nthen head to Sam&#39;s. The kids pick out cases of snacks, candy, fruit,  <br/>\netc. We store it up the cabinets, and it usually lasts throughout the  <br/>\nmonth. We make a lot of snacks from scratch (it helps with the food  <br/>\nissues) and that&#39;s a ton easier. $5 for 24# of flour, and another few  <br/>\ndollars for eggs, chocolate chips and baking soda, butter, and you  <br/>\nhave enough cookies to feed the neighborhood.

We&#39;ve unschooled with the label for almost 4 years, and<br/>\nwithout the label for a few years before that. Our budget has varied from<br/>\nbelow the poverty level to times of financial wealth. In any of those times,<br/>\nwe have just put the information out there to the whole family. &quot;This month<br/>\nwe have about $500 for food, what do you want to do?&quot; Ideas vary all the<br/>\ntime, but it is always a sure thing that we have an agreed upon plan in the<br/>\nend. And I often have little to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we have plenty of money and I just ask what people want before I<br/>\ngo to the store. Sometimes people will get a list going on their own and<br/>\ngive it to me or post it. Sometimes I go to the grocery store twice in a<br/>\nday, or three or more times in a week. It just depends on the time and the<br/>\nneeds and the wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we label food so that food that particular people pick out special<br/>\nisn&#39;t eaten by someone else by mistake. We&#39;ve had almost no problem with<br/>\npeople eating someone else&#39;s labeled food or portion...everyone respects<br/>\neveryone else&#39;s stuff. That comes with unschooling in general...everyone<br/>\nfeels respected and in turn respects others and their stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for the food portion of your question, I would suggest sharing all the<br/>\ninformation and talking about it together. If you take yourself out of the<br/>\ncontrol seat, the group will probably direct you on how to spend the food<br/>\nmoney just fine. You of course have your own food choices to add into the<br/>\nmix.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest that as much as possible the situation is set up so<br/>\nthat you don&#39;t control others&#39; food intake. If things are labeled in a way<br/>\nthat everyone can understand, that should take you out of that arena pretty<br/>\nmuch. If someone wants to eat more than you think they should portion out,<br/>\ngive them the information about them eating the whole thing in one sitting,<br/>\nand let them decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople share their &quot;special&quot; foods with others pretty regularly around here.<br/>\nThat is always a beautiful thing to see. Even if we can&#39;t buy everything<br/>\neveryone wanted, we all still feel like we have an abundance. That comes<br/>\nfrom being listened to, and being part of the decision-making process, and<br/>\nhaving control. We feel contentedly full.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yo son wanted a new video game when we were at Universal Studios. I<br/>\nhad about $20 that I could spend on it...the rest was for gas and food. He<br/>\nwanted one that just came out...it was $50. I literally took the cash out of<br/>\nmy pocket and we counted together. I never said no. We thought quietly for a<br/>\nmoment. Then he said, &quot;Do you think that Grammie will lend me $30 if I pay<br/>\nher back from my money when we get home?&quot; She was with us and my answer was,<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know...you want me to ask?&quot; He asked her himself, she said yes<br/>\n(even though she struggles with the unlimited video game playing) and he<br/>\nbought the game. He was SOO happy. He kept hugging us and thanking us...for<br/>\nhours! As soon as we got home, he paid her back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt full...full of love, full of appreciation, full of abundance. Even<br/>\nthough it wasn&#39;t an automatic easy purchase.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;all those folks running around&quot; state above, it is the life we<br/>\nchose. It is work to make sure that you are paying attention to what each<br/>\nchild&#39;s experiences are each day, to be watchful for their individual tastes<br/>\nand needs, while you are tending the whole group. This may be more work than<br/>\na family with one or two kids, but that doesn&#39;t matter. You may have to<br/>\nexpand yourself beyond what others do, but it&#39;s just your job. The question<br/>\nof &quot;how do you handle ru...&quot; makes me think that you are &quot;handling&quot; things<br/>\nrather than living life happily. Can you think of this very active time as<br/>\nenjoyable? I think that would make a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have felt very s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with the activity of our lives at times,<br/>\nbut then I remember it is just a feeling. It can be released like every<br/>\nother feeling so that I can be completely present in this moment with<br/>\nwhomever I am with, in joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are older now and I rather be with them than anyone else in the<br/>\nworld.

I don&#39;t mind my kids eating what they want - that&#39;s how I grew up.  I just don&#39;t know how I can afford a food bill that is more than my rent!  And with 7 ppl in a house, it can easily be more than $1000.  So I end up having to tell them that they can&#39;t eat all of such-and-such because it&#39;s not in the budget to buy anymore.  Or, once it&#39;s all gone there won&#39;t be anymore.  And I don&#39;t like having to do that.  I just don&#39;t know how to get around that particular issue.  Food is expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so excited about ru, and so frustrated at the same time because I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m able to &quot;do it&quot; like I&#39;d like.  But that&#39;s my controlling Virgo nature - trying to get it &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me out guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha <br/>\n&quot;Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and dance with the Earth in all her glorious colors.&quot; ~ Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"conference Maisha","postDate":"1143525082","msgId":24967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFDRDYyOTg2LTNFMDgtNDAyQy1CNUZFLTIzQzdENDUwNjIxRUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxMTZFNzNDOTc1NDA3N0Q5NEZCMTQ5OTlEMzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxNTI2Mjc5MkI1Q0U5NURBQzFFNUIwOTlEQzBAcGh4LmdibD4gPDYuMS4xLjEuMi4yMDA2MDMyNTEwMzExMi4wMWI4YzkxMEBpbmNvbWluZy52ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDlCQ0I5MTYxLTMwQkEtNEVDMC1CRDNBLTRDMUQ5Q0QzNjY0QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEJBWTExMC1EQVYzQzE3OTlCNjhGQzUyMERCMzMwN0U5OURDMEBwaHguZ2JsPiA8MzREREI0QjgtRTcwRS00M0VGLUJBRjAtOEFGMzE2MDBEMkYzQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFZMTEwLURBVjExNkU3M0M5NzU0MDc3RDk0RkIxNDk5OUQzMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":24965,"nextInTopic":24968,"prevInTime":24966,"nextInTime":24968,"topicId":24910,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m also eagerly looking forward to the conference.

I&#39;ve been reading and re-reading your website, Joyce&#39;s, Danielle&#39;s,Ren&#39;s, and other sources.  I&#39;m trying to understand unschooling myself.  My husband doesn&#39;t know much about it.  He was raised in a house like most, where adults were the rule.  He is interested in learning, but has some concerns.  I&#39;m happy that he was interested in finding out more!    My husband doesn&#39;t think that going to Harvard or being a doctor is successful.  After all, he got a GED after being bored in high school.  His fears come more from the &quot;lack of control&quot; aspect than the unschooling aspect.  He has no problem with &quot;living and learning&quot;.  He was honestly wondering, though, if children who were unschooled were encouraged to go on to &quot;mainstream professions&quot;.  I tried to explain to him that I&#39;m sure some do, if that&#39;s what they are passionate about.  But I&#39;m still learning and unschooling myself, so I couldn&#39;t explain it well.  I guess he is worried that he didn&#39;t do much with his life because he wasn&#39;t encouraged, and he wants to be sure that his children (we have 5) reach whatever their potential is.  He just wants to be sure that he gives them all they need, and that they don&#39;t &quot;settle&quot; for something.  All of this is coming from his perspective, and the life that he has lived, which has been very rough, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have many or any close &quot;professional&quot; friends, so we couldn&#39;t ask them about that.  He never went to college and I went to three different colleges and dropped out.  I&#39;m now going back to get my degree simply because I want to - not because I Have To.  And it will be much more exciting for me to finish because I&#39;m doing it just to learn more, and not for a &quot;career&quot; or to make money (such a lie they tell).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway....I&#39;m sorry again.  Hubby and I were kind of in the midst of an argument about parenting and such, and my angst probably came across in my writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to those of you who answered.  I will continue to read and learn, and visit the links and read the books that have been mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha <br/>\n&quot;Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and dance with the Earth in all her glorious colors.&quot; ~ Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24966,"nextTopicId":25012}}
