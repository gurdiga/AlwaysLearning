I get sick more when the weather<br/>\nstormy and there are pressure changes, and on windy<br/>\nroads, or if I look away from the road while we are<br/>\nturning.  Some people&#39;s driving is worse for me than<br/>\nothers.  Thankfully my husband&#39;s driving doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nme sick very often, but if/when it does he is quick to<br/>\npull over and give me the wheel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny how most people who are not sufferers of<br/>\nit, really do not fathom the depth of the misery that<br/>\nis motion sickness.  It&#39;s not an &quot;upset tummy&quot;  but<br/>\nall over hot and cold flashes, cold sweats, dizzyness,<br/>\nnausea, headache, shakes, weakness, disorientation and<br/>\nother things.  It&#39;s a really awful, and can come on<br/>\nquickly and last and last and last...  I once got sick<br/>\non a two block car ride to a grovery store and had to<br/>\nthrow up.  My merciless father used to force us on<br/>\nthese 12 hours of driving a day marathon vacations<br/>\ndriving from California to Wash. DC and Florida and<br/>\nplaces like that.  Ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old sometimes get&#39;s carsick and we are<br/>\nalways quick to pull over and walk with him and offer<br/>\nhim every comfort and sympathy we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12370,"nextTopicId":12488}}
