This got me curious and I looked it up - reforging those synaptic pathways? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeuroscience researchers think our brains make nearly twice as many synaptic connections than we could ever use. They call this &quot;blooming,&quot; and &quot;pruning&quot; deals with the overproduction, at different times in different brain areas (this relates to the &quot;critical periods&quot; another poster mentioned).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the prefrontal cortext (higher-level thinking, self-regulation), peak overproduction occurs at about age 1, yet still doesn&#39;t reach it&#39;s adult level of synaptic density until middle to late adolescence. Then there&#39;s said to be a period of &quot;pruning&quot; which is &quot;critical&quot; for higher-order cognitive functioning such as reasoning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the way I understand it, major &quot;pruning&quot; at certain &quot;critical&quot; stages is a normal developmental process, like puberty. Also, because of the brain&#39;s &quot;plasticity&quot; (as another poster mentioned), our brains are always &quot;blooming&quot; and &quot;pruning&quot; based on our interests, our attention, our focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So the more experiences the child has, the more synapses he&#39;ll retain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the more experiences a child has, the more synapses s/he will FORM (in the overproduction phase, or childhood/early adolescence).

Two things were connected at one  <br/>\ntime, but perhaps the call has been disconnected.<br/>\n<br/>\nUNlike old time telephone switchboards, an old connection can be  <br/>\nrestablished.  So it&#39;s more like they fade from brightness to plain to  <br/>\ndull to dusty/pale, and other more interesting things take the  <br/>\nforeground of thought and awareness.   If something comes along to  <br/>\nremind (literally put it in your mind again), the old connection will  <br/>\nlight up again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how I understand it, and my analogy might be as crude as  <br/>\n&quot;pruning,&quot; but I don&#39;t like pruning.  I hardly even cut branches off  <br/>\nmy trees anymore; seriously.   I sure don&#39;t want to think of people  <br/>\nclipping things out of my brain or my kids&#39; brains.

If you could, all students in school would get 100% on every test. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless children are being locked in an empty room with white walls everyday, they *are* experiencing things and therefore their synapses are developing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince unschooling isn&#39;t a hugely common thing, I&#39;ll guess you went to school or at the very least were homeschooled. Think about all of the things you learned in school that you no longer know because they simply weren&#39;t relevant in your life (pruning). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you had spent all of that time you had been in school instead learning about what WAS relevant to your life? I would guess a lot less &quot;pruning&quot; would happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just a guess, but I would think unschooling children&#39;s brains prune less and develop more. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carrie Labinski&quot; &lt;labinski@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard that children development many, many synapses in their brain but then a pruning occurs.
