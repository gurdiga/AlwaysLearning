That was going to be the other letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Priss1000, I have photos of  me on the ramp, and it&#39;s clear that I <br/>\nfell way before the puddle.  My foot doesn&#39;t even reach it.  And you can see <br/>\nthe really steep angle of the ramp too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want to write to the city inspector, and to the hotel, asking if they <br/>\nhave fixed that ramp and if they intend to, and depending on the responses I <br/>\nget, I&#39;ll either be sweet and reasonable, or I&#39;ll have a lawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does it work, with me in one state and them in another, as lawyers go?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9919,"nextTopicId":9973}}
