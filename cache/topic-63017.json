to things they want.  Find creative ways to meet the goal of jumping.  Beds work much better for jumping anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like the writing on the wall.  If you really don&#39;t like your child to write on the walls, find another way to meet that need.  When our young wall writer was active, we hung large sheets of paper from the floor to as high as she could reach and covered 2 entire walls like that in the hallway of our house.  We left a little tub of crayons next to it.  I only cleaned that wall from crayon once.  The papers were left up for at least 2 yrs and eventually were covered entirely with drawings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI made a judgment that I didn&#39;t want to scrub crayon off of walls repeatedly and found a solution that met both our needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Clarifying some unschooling aspects","postDate":"1316548529","msgId":63041,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTY1NDg1MjkuODkxMzUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1YXAxMytzb251QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEM3NkM5MTMyLURGMTAtNDUzMi1CNUYyLTI2NkIwNTBFQjBEQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPGo1YXAxMytzb251QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63040,"nextInTopic":63042,"prevInTime":63040,"nextInTime":63042,"topicId":63017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***and the same with the principle of saftey, if he s jumping on the couch, I dont need to worry about what to say to him or whether to correct him or make him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-593804965\">***and the same with the principle of saftey, if he&#39;s jumping on the couch, I dont need to worry about what to say to him or whether to correct him or make him wrong or sorry or any other number of things that old school parenting would have us think we need to do, all I have to do is make sure he&#39;s safe with no judgement.***<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless of course you don&#39;t want people to jump on the couch.  Then you need to find an alternative to couch jumping.  It&#39;s about meeting needs.  Your child has a need to burn off energy, maybe even to jump and he also has a need to do so safely.  The couch need not be the location for jumping safely.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Clarifying some unschooling aspects","postDate":"1316547203","msgId":63039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEQjAxQzU1LUZFQzQtNDY3RS1CQUZDLTlDRDdGRTk0RUNBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1YW5yMSttMGoxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1YW5yMSttMGoxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63038,"nextInTopic":63040,"prevInTime":63038,"nextInTime":63040,"topicId":63017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Finding a better word will help.

So please correct me on this or add things that I may be missing etc if you will..<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one of the aspects of unschooling is to get everyones needs met.  For example I&#39;ve read lots of questions about kids not wanting to go shopping with their parents, so as an unschooler we would look for ways to not have to bring the child with us, so they could stay at home somehow, respecting their desires so to speak?  And if it wasnt possible for them to stay home, we&#39;d find a way to make to trip more fun by going somewhere of interest to them etc?   (I&#39;m aiming this at young children who are too young to stay at home on their own).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the areas I am a bit confused is when a child has &#39;misbehaved&#39; for want of a better word.  For example, siblings are hitting, a ball is being throw in the house where its not safe, or for example my 2 yo is drawing on the walls.  Is this where Principles come in?  How do you communicate these?  Coming from an authoritarian upbringing myself, I really have NO real life examples of what it would look like to discuss principles with a child that is not coming across as coercive or authoritarian control.  I read a lot about people saying they disscuss with their children about things on TV or in the media, (advertising for example) so they can come to their own decisions about these things, or food too and how we feel after we have eaten certain foods.  I would actually love if someone felt inclined to post some youtube videos on this topic giving specific examples, so I can hear tone of voice, what words you use, how you say it, how you start the conversation.   I know it is so dependant on age of child, and also personality, but examples non the less for me are really helpful.  (For example Sandra responded to someone on another post / list about her child calling her mom &#39;stupid&#39; and wrote what she would say to the child.  that was really helpful for me, it seemed so simple and obvious, yet I cant seem to get my head around it for anything else.. yet)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nEmma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62936,"nextTopicId":63037}}
