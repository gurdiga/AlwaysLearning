At least it is in the mountains where I live. <br/>\nWe tried many different methods with no success. :-/ Trust me when I tell <br/>\nyou that it is cold here and has been for what seems like forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...our dear little Tiny was cremated last night in a peaceful funeral pyre <br/>\nby the waterfall. We are all looking forward to seeing how his ashes have <br/>\nnourished the bulbs and wildflowers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs part of her grieving process (apparently) Casey purchased a Teddy Bear <br/>\nHamster yesterday whom she has named Cookie. The King is dead, long live the <br/>\nQueen. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5294,"nextTopicId":5328}}
