It could be <br/>\njust crackers and cheese or just ham and pineapple.  The point for my <br/>\nkids was that they were busy and didn&#39;t take time to eat. To avoid them <br/>\ngetting cranky due to hunger, I&#39;d put out plates of little finger-foods <br/>\nthat were easy for them to eat as they played. It wasn&#39;t to somehow <br/>\ntrick them into eating healthy foods, but to accommodate food offering <br/>\nto their needs. Instead of having &quot;breakfast&quot; and &quot;lunch&quot; or even <br/>\n&quot;dinner&quot; (in quotes meaning the conventional idea of a mealtime at a <br/>\ntable with certain types of foods), my kids grazed throughout the day <br/>\nand evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one day in my childhood super clearly. A standout day. It was <br/>\nfall - the air was crisp and we could see the snow on the mountains. I <br/>\nwas playing outdoors with a lot of friends from the neighborhood - <br/>\nplaying kickball in the street. I&#39;d been running a lot for hours and I <br/>\nremember suddenly being so famished I couldn&#39;t function. I ran into the <br/>\nhouse - my mom had made pot roast and was taking it out of the oven. The <br/>\nkitchen was steamy warm and smelled SO good. But we were having dinner <br/>\nin the dining room and the table was all set and she told me I had to <br/>\nwait for food. She&#39;d been chopping carrots, earlier, and there were <br/>\nstill some raw carrots sitting there. I asked if I could have something <br/>\nto eat right now and she said, without really looking or paying <br/>\nattention to me, &quot;No, just wait, we&#39;re going to eat in about 15 minutes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember I thought I would die if I had to wait 15 minutes. I waited <br/>\nuntil her back was turned and I grabbed one of the carrots as I went out <br/>\nof the kitchen. I went back outside and bit off a piece of carrot and it <br/>\ntasted SO sweet and good. I remember just chewing on it and the feeling <br/>\nof swallowing it and everything. But I felt SO guilty - it wasn&#39;t like <br/>\nme to be sneaky (it wasn&#39;t like my mom to give me a reason to be <br/>\nsneaky). I went back in and told my mom I&#39;d stolen a carrot stick I <br/>\nremember thinking I might get my hand slapped - weird thought since I&#39;d <br/>\nnever been spanked or slapped, but I must have gotten that idea from tv <br/>\nor a story or something. I remember she looked a little bewildered and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s okay, but next time you should ask.&quot; Something casual <br/>\nlike that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, when my own kids asked for food right when I was in the middle of <br/>\nmaking something for them that would be done in 15 minutes, that <br/>\nincident came back to me so clearly and I ALWAYS gave my kids some food <br/>\nimmediately. When kids are hungry, they are SO hungry that they hurt. <br/>\nMaking them wait a few minutes can be really cruel. Better for them to <br/>\nhave food offered before they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Wanting to start unschooling food","postDate":"1295970233","msgId":59219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrenZMVkpWa3llK2crSEV1OVBwV3oyWXdidi1ENWU0aWFPaGNGZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4Q0FGM0E5LTk5MjEtNEE4RS05RDdELTc0QTc0NEI0RUJGMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlobDhnOCs4ZGJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8OTIwNTMxLjE1MjkwLnFtQHdlYjgxNTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPDc1REM5NEY0QkMzQjQ3OEZBNzg4REQwOEM4ODc1QTBEQGVsaXNhMjk3MlBDPgk8QUFOTGtUaT0xLUp4TD1HNTdiS2dpUkFqeV80Ty1ON1JaZEdZZFFHQ1R5ZEEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8OThDQUYzQTktOTkyMS00QThFLTlEN0QtNzRBNzQ0QjRFQkYxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59218,"nextInTopic":59222,"prevInTime":59218,"nextInTime":59220,"topicId":59177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If there isn t enough food to go around, I hope more can be found since the needs don t go away on a premise or ethic of sharing.

We called them &quot;N&#39;s Smorgasbord.&quot; I think my mom used to make plated like that for my brother and me when we were small too. I always saw it as a way to offer bite-sized nutrient-dense food to an ever moving child. Dips were/are a big part of the plate, because as Glenda and Pam mentioned, hummus, peanut butter and labne, are great protein options for vegetarians. We also have a collection of cocktail forks and other tiny eating tools that just seemed to make everything on the plate a little more fun to eat: little clawed tongs for pickles or cut up veggie sticks and small butter knives with fish-fin handles to spread nut butters on fruit slices. Smoothies, which to me are like liquified Monkey Platters (that sounds gross), are supported by a collection of fun straws.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to say that our daughter could live on air.

They always have a good range though... Actually at the moment my boys like it when I use a muffin tin- 12 spaces with something different in each one- it looks very appealing. <br/>\nI often have to clear the table to make space for a new platter so bits of what I&#39;m putting away will go into it- that&#39;s when I recycle the end of crisp or sweet packets into the platter. <br/>\nFor me the point of these platters has been their variety and visual appeal- reminding busy people to eat, and a way of giving a new lease of life to some of the half eaten fruit and packets of things lying around- so I don&#39;t feel that anything is actually off limits. <br/>\nBut ideas can serve different purposes in different houses and I have young children- who may be particilarly keen on eating in this way.

I must add, though, that we hold religious services<br/>\n&gt; at our house every Saturday (and sometimes Friday night) and on those days,<br/>\n&gt; we have candy and cake and cookies.  I grew up having candy only on the<br/>\n&gt; Sabbath-it was a way to make the day sweet and special.  That is what I now<br/>\n&gt; do with my own children.  We always have cake or something like it for<br/>\n&gt; dessert Friday night and we have candy during services and cake and cookies<br/>\n&gt; with our potluck lunch after services. But, part of my own food issues is<br/>\n&gt; that most of the time these foods were unavailable to me.

So we had nine years (eight or so, I guess, not counting infancy pre-food) of not making any big deal at our house about when, whether or how much a child ate.   Being able to turn down foods kept most or all of the food-aversion problems at bay.   An &quot;aversion&quot; was treated as &quot;No problem; maybe someday,&quot; or &quot;He doesn&#39;t like that yet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t &quot;dessert train&quot; our kids at all, either.  When we had a sit-down meal, there wasn&#39;t dessert served.  If they wanted something later that wasn&#39;t a problem, but they were usually already full.   &quot;Save room for dessert&quot; was never spoken.    At restaurants when the waiter would come and ask me or Keith if we wanted to see the dessert menu or if anyone wanted dessert, we would turn to the kids and look questioningly or ask if they wanted anything.  Occasionally one of them would.  Sometimes one would split something with me or Keith, or we would all taste it and the one who chose it would eat the rest, or take some home.  I can&#39;t think of a time except maybe at a buffet when all three of them had dessert.  We&#39;ve gotten some surprised looks from waiters, for sure.  Sometimes at a buffet one of them would go to the desserts first, but usually to look for something specific.  I can remember cheesecake once, and banana pudding once.  But that didn&#39;t keep them from going to the other foods after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not comfortable when someone says ice cream is great for breakfast, or nervously says something about my kids probably eating wild and crazy things (not a quote; can&#39;t think of a quote).  It&#39;s more reactionary than it is open.  I know balance is hard to find sometimes when people are changing in extreme ways, but it seems to me that balance should be &quot;on the poster,&quot; as it were, and not the wild newly-freed extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"dezignarob","from":"&quot;dezignarob&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Wanting to start unschooling food","postDate":"1295947702","msgId":59202,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlobTUzbStvNjQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5MTY0MjkxLUEwRkItNEE1OS1CRTJDLTI4OUU3Njg2M0MzREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59201,"nextInTopic":59203,"prevInTime":59201,"nextInTime":59203,"topicId":59177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==== Those monkeys at the Rio Grande zoo didn t have dips.

I like the <br/>\nterm, though. But, I was doing the exact same thing - putting out a <br/>\nplate of cheese and crackers, grapes, carrots, sliced hard-boiled eggs, <br/>\ngrape tomatoes, dill pickles, leftover bit of chicken or other meat. <br/>\nPeanut butter and sliced apples was a big favorite. Sometimes I made <br/>\ntuna sandwiches and cut them into little bite-sized pieces. Sometimes I <br/>\nspread some cream cheese on graham crackers and sprinkled them with <br/>\ncinnamon. It was not a sweets plate - it was what they often ate in <br/>\nplace of a more conventional meal. The point was that it was nutritious <br/>\nand very appealing and very very easy to nibble at while continuing to <br/>\ndo whatever they were doing.  My kids don&#39;t seem to have the protein <br/>\nneeds that some people do, but they did get some protein on those <br/>\nplates, pretty much every time (and this was a very regular thing - I <br/>\nprobably made a platter like this almost every day that we were at home).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I did put &quot;dips&quot; on the plate, quite often. My kids would eat <br/>\nlots of raw veggies with Ranch dressing, for example, but didn&#39;t like <br/>\nthe raw veggies otherwise. Rosie has always loved mustard to dip things <br/>\ninto. Sometimes I thinned some peanut butter for a dip. We had hummus as <br/>\na dip. Salsa of various kinds. There is a Persian food that is sometimes <br/>\ncalled, &quot;Yogurt cheese,&quot; or, in Arabic it is Lebni (in Persian it is <br/>\nMast-o-Kisaee). I&#39;d sometimes thin that a bit and they&#39;d use it as a dip <br/>\n- or I&#39;d mix various seasonings into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the dips seem natural to me - kids like to dip and it makes the <br/>\nplate more appealing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a plate filled with sweets does miss the point - NOT that <br/>\nthere is something wrong with making a plate full of sweets. Yum. But <br/>\nthe point of the monkey platters was how to offer food to kids that <br/>\nwould help them feel better and let them get some nutrition without <br/>\ninterrupting their activities. Feeding marshmallows to a hungry kid <br/>\nisn&#39;t really likely to help them feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":372124303,"authorName":"Elisa","from":"&quot;Elisa&quot; &lt;elisa29@...&gt;","profile":"elisa290772","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Wanting to start unschooling food","postDate":"1295932901","msgId":59200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU5OEFENUQ2RjhDRjRFRjlCQkYxNzBFNTQ0QTQzRjY2QGVsaXNhMjk3MlBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlobGx0bytlMXJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlobGx0bytlMXJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59199,"nextInTopic":59201,"prevInTime":59199,"nextInTime":59201,"topicId":59177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We know that next payday we can get more if we want, but we actually don&#39;t choose to have ice cream around here that often anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re getting low on something, it gets added to the grocery list that we keep on the fridge -- all three of us are then aware that more of whatever will be bought next grocery shopping trip. Sometimes we&#39;re able to go buy those things sooner than next payday (and when we can, we do), but sometimes we can&#39;t and knowing that they&#39;re &quot;on the list&quot; helps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===but still she dosn&#39;t get the fact that the food needs to be for everyone===<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your daughter?

I put gum on platters and he<br/>\nfirst eats other stuff most of the time. Unless he isn&#39;t particularly<br/>\nhungry. He&#39;s not all that fond of toothpicks lately but he liked them for a<br/>\nwhile and he really does like all kinds of dips. Something funny ... I<br/>\nmashed up some sweet potato one day to dip carrots in and he liked that as a<br/>\nnovelty but it hasn&#39;t become an regular item.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 24, 2011 at 7:20 PM, Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Get over it.

I don&#39;t buy the oreo cookies that my daughter is always begging for.  I have chocolate covered granola bars because I&#39;ve always thought of them as a better alternative.

Do I just start saying yes when they ask, or do I explain to them that I have a new way of thinking about the subject.  I am pretty open to them about the choices we have made regarding school and why we do what we do.  Should this be one of those things that I say &quot;when we go shopping, tell me what you want and I will buy it.&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never thought that I would reach the point of wanting to unschool food.  But when I think about my own issues with food and the issues I think we have created for my 10 year old son, I think that I have been going about this the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son loves food and has an amazing sense of taste.  He loves to cook and he relishes trying new things.  But, he is borderline on his BMI and I have started projecting my own weight issues on to him.  I realized after reading the food pages on Sandra&#39;s site, that by saying &quot;I think that&#39;s enough, you can have some tomorrow&quot; that I have created a situation where he is afraid of my removing something that he loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that is where I am.
