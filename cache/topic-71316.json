I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619882853\">This is from an article in the New Yorker about deciding whether or not to<br/>\ngo to graduate school. But this part reminds me a lot of deciding to<br/>\nunschool. I especially love the part about you being changed, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Sometimes, you can�t know what something is like until you try it. You<br/>\ncan�t know what Vegemite tastes like, for example, until you try Vegemite;<br/>\nyou can�t know what having children will be like until you have children.<br/>\nYou can guess what these things will be like; you can ask people; you can<br/>\ndraw up lists of pros and cons; but, at the end of the day, �without having<br/>\nthe experience itself� you �cannot even have an approximate idea as to what<br/>\nit is like to have that experience.� That�s because you won�t just be<br/>\nhaving the experience; the experience will be changing you. On the other<br/>\nside, you will be a different kind of person. Making such a decision, you<br/>\nwill always be uninformed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/04/graduate-school-advice-impossible-decision.html\">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/04/graduate-school-advice-impossible-decision.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71315,"nextTopicId":71294}}
