Especially  <br/>\nschool kids, who might get &quot;straight A&#39;s in reading&quot; and not be able  <br/>\nto read anything but their reading books or other &quot;graded&quot; materials  <br/>\n(things written specifically for them to be able to read with their  <br/>\nlimited skills).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest problem with lots of people is the idea that their  <br/>\nsituation is unique, that they&#39;re the last one, that they&#39;re the only  <br/>\none, that they&#39;re behind, deficient...<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my kids when they came and said &quot;Jesse can do [something] and I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t,&quot; I would say  something like &quot;Jimmy can too, but Jesse can&#39;t  <br/>\nskate as well as you can, and Jimmy isn&#39;t as nice to his sister.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you focus on what they can do, and remember that learning can be  <br/>\ndone without reading, and that there are LOTS of things to do while  <br/>\nhe&#39;s getting to the point that all those words come to make sense,   <br/>\nthen you&#39;re helping him as a person (not as a reader or non-reader,  <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s not an either/or, black-or-white thing either).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was worried with Holly, and I felt bad for her, and I knew she would  <br/>\nread.  She wanted me to get the 100 Lessons book, and I stalled and  <br/>\nfinally bought a used copy.  I thought it was dreadful, but went  <br/>\nthrough a couple of the pages with her.  She just wasn&#39;t ready, but I  <br/>\noffered a few times to work with her, and both she and I moved more  <br/>\ntoward other interests and projects--art, her pet rats, clothes/ <br/>\nfashion.  Dolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen her reading did kick in it flooded in.  A friend of hers (kind of  <br/>\na bully friend) also had pet rats, and had a book about rats Holly  <br/>\nwanted me to get her.  I did.  Holly could read then, and she read a  <br/>\nsection the other girl had &quot;read&quot; to her.  The other girl had been  <br/>\nmaking stuff up.  The information she had given Holly, with that page  <br/>\nopen, was *not* what the book said.   Very illuminating for Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":338301721,"authorName":"Connie Johnson","from":"Connie Johnson &lt;connie.k.johnson@...&gt;","profile":"conj123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [SPAM:#] [AlwaysLearning] Re: learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255406885","msgId":47943,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE9GNDRERTVERUEuQTk4QUMxMEQtT044NzI1NzY0RS4wMDE2OTFENy04NzI1NzY0RS4wMDE2OTYxRUBsZWFybm5ldC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4MjI2XzEyNTUzODQ3OTdfNEFEM0E2RENfOTgyMjZfNDM0XzFfaGIwOHVxKzc4b25AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47944,"prevInTime":47942,"nextInTime":47944,"topicId":47943,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"well probably a bit of both - he realizes that his friends and other kids that he knows that are  his age and younger are reading - carnationsgalore ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1535186997\">well probably a bit of both - he realizes that his friends and other kids that<br/>\nhe knows that are  his age and younger are reading -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n             &quot;carnationsgalore&quot;                                               <br/>\n             &lt;addled.homemaker@                                               <br/>\n             gmail.com&gt;                                                    To <br/>\n             Sent by:                   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>        <br/>\n             AlwaysLearning@yah                                            cc <br/>\n             oogroups.com                                                     <br/>\n                                                                      Subject <br/>\n                                        [SPAM:#] [AlwaysLearning] Re:         <br/>\n             10/12/2009 04:03           learning to read at 12                <br/>\n             PM                                                               <br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n             Please respond to                                                <br/>\n             AlwaysLearning@yah                                               <br/>\n                oogroups.com                                                  <br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; i have been reading about dyslexia - and it sounds exactly like                  <br/>\n &gt; that - so of course now i am feeling guilty about not getting him                <br/>\n &gt; help earlier! and am questioning the whole unschooling thing!                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n </span></blockquote> I understand you feel frustrated, but I don&#39;t think labeling him is a good idea.   <br/>\n If a child isn&#39;t developmentally ready to read, no amount of verbal pushing,       <br/>\n worksheets, textbooks, or simple readers are going to change that. Surely that     <br/>\n causes frustration on both sides. That is why some kids have learning disability   <br/>\n labels. I think teachers are offended when a child doesn&#39;t learn under their       <br/>\n instruction, especially with all the &quot;help&quot; used. I have never understood that     <br/>\n belief because I had college classes in early childhood education that focused on  <br/>\n learning about developmental skills. Those skills just cannot be hurried anymore   <br/>\n than someone can make a child walk or talk earlier.                                <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n I think others are offering great advice. I have one question though. Did your son <br/>\n decide he was ready to read, or have you or someone else nudged him because of his <br/>\n age?                                                                               <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n Beth M.                                                                            <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n                                                                                    <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47897,"nextTopicId":47946}}
