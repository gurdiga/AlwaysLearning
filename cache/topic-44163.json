I can do it with some things that I seem to have an innate confidence in, like anything artistic or cooking or gardening, which are hands-on, but to my mind, require such a lower level of technical aptitude (for me anyway -- I don&#39;t want to be insulting people who are geniuses in these fields).  I wonder if it is because those fields were never &quot;taught&quot; to me and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t have a block.  I truly don&#39;t know.   CONFIDENCE seems to be the key, though.

Funny coincidence.  Unschooling parents seem to be more involved, for the most part, than adults in this article, but maybe the public schools would get better results if they would start laying things out for exploration and letting the staff head to the lunch room for the day with their own projects :) The bit in the article describing how they just left a computer out, gave me a really funny visual that made me think of something I saw once with chimpanzees and how smart they are and how they will go about investigating new things, poking them with sticks, trying this and that, or whatever :)  People who are &quot;well-schooled&quot; and who over time have experienced countless occurrences of being given a set of instructions about how you are to go about learning something first, before you dive in, would have a much harder time in this scenario, I would think.

I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow if it&#39;s also in the magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first it&#39;s about the study in India ten years ago of what kids  <br/>\nwould do if a computer were left out where they could get to it.    <br/>\nWhat they did was learn like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is interesting, and here&#39;s a portion of it.<br/>\n**************<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t school lessons spread in the same wildfire way that Mitra  <br/>\nobserved in his experiments on minimally invasive education? It is not  <br/>\nhard to think of many answers to this question. Here are a few that  <br/>\npop to mind:<br/>\n<br/>\n• Children in school are not free to pursue their own, self-chosen  <br/>\ninterests, and this mutes their enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\n• Children in school are constantly evaluated. The concern for  <br/>\nevaluation and pleasing the teacher--or, for some children, a  <br/>\nrebellious reaction against such evaluation--overrides and subverts  <br/>\nthe possibility of developing genuine interest in the assigned tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\n• Children in school are often shown one and only one way to solve a  <br/>\nproblem and are told that other ways are incorrect, so the excitement  <br/>\nof discovering new ways is prevented.<br/>\n<br/>\n• Segregation of children by age in schools prevents the age mixing  <br/>\nand diversity that seem to be key to children&#39;s natural ways of  <br/>\nlearning. Mitra observed that the mix of abilities and interests in  <br/>\nthe age-mixed groups that gathered around the outdoor computers  <br/>\nensured that different functions of the computer were tried out and  <br/>\nplayed with by different children and that a wide variety of  <br/>\ndiscoveries were made, which could then spread from child to child.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is so easy, and such fun, when it occurs naturally.  ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone with a closed-minded relative might want to send that on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your closed-minded relative doesn&#39;t have the internet, tell them  <br/>\nstreet kids in India can learn to use a computer, and they should get  <br/>\nwith the times. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44210,"nextTopicId":44150}}
