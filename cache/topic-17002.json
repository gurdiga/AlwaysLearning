He had 4 small helpings of whole wheat spaghetti and tomato sauce<br/>\nlast night along with 2 glasses of milk.  It has made a big difference.  I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering if he was just too busy to think about eating before so when he<br/>\nrealized he needed something to eat, he REALLY needed something to eat.<br/>\nSugar and refined food would give him a quick energy boost.  Getting the<br/>\nless refined snacks through out the day brought to him perhaps helps him not<br/>\nbe already in an energy slump when he eats.  I don&#39;t know but I wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16965,"nextTopicId":16647}}
