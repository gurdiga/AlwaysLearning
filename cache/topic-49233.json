It&#39;s also regional and so not the best  <br/>\nthing for the list.  Still, it DOES look super fun and here&#39;s the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ugo.unschoolgathering.com/\">http://www.ugo.unschoolgathering.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Keith said, kind of, &quot;Let&#39;s go get a van.&quot;  So there&#39;s more  <br/>\nto the story than that, but we did.  We went to CarMax and looked at  <br/>\nthree used mini-vans we had already read about online.  It was  <br/>\nsnowing,  I picked the least expensive of the three  (and didn&#39;t even  <br/>\nlook at the Hondas or Toyotas because they were twice as much or more)  <br/>\nand Keith is pained by spending money.   But after a few hours spent  <br/>\nunexpectedly sitting in the credit union finance office, and back to  <br/>\nthe car dealer, I drove a van home that I hadn&#39;t expected at all when  <br/>\nI woke up, and that was an AWESOME Christmas thing.  But it also took  <br/>\na day out of a busy week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis afternoon we&#39;re going to a Christmas party/dinner at Marty&#39;s  <br/>\ngirlfriend&#39;s parents&#39; house.  Marty and Ashlee have been a couple for  <br/>\na year now (by one reckoning, and six months by another), and she  <br/>\nwants us to meet her parents.   Kinda nervous business.  They live in  <br/>\nBernalillo (a town older than Albuquerque, I think, 15 miles north of  <br/>\nhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that, and Christmas itself, will cause me distractions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those far to the east of here, especially, or those who don&#39;t do  <br/>\nChristmas, there&#39;s a chat tomorrow which I might still be on so that  <br/>\n(maybe) I can hear about Holly&#39;s Christmas, and see if anyone has  <br/>\nChristmas emergency unschooling needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular\">http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a different chat room.  If you were gone from the chats  <br/>\nbecause the font was too small, this one can be adjusted on your own  <br/>\ndisplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that sometimes posts are waiting for approval and that the  <br/>\nmoderators are busy.   Things will get calmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMerry Christmas where applicable!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49190,"nextTopicId":49205}}
