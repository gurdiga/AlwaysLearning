My <br/>\nson is 12 and still not at all comfortable with writing. Even within the <br/>\ndreaded school system, they recognize that there are many different levels <br/>\nof ability, especially in the reading/writing stuff at age 8. If your son <br/>\ncan make up a &quot;sentence&quot; like &quot;A bat is echolocation&quot;, I think he&#39;ll do <br/>\nfine. I&#39;m very impressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to take away any power they might have to shame him by reminding the <br/>\nzoo staff that this is not school. Talk to them beforehand about how you <br/>\nwish your son to participate. You&#39;re probably paying for the class, right? <br/>\nYou should be able to ask that he get from it what you want. And then run <br/>\ninterference for him as a volunteer. He sounds brilliant. :o) Could he come <br/>\nover and teach ME some stuff about zoo animals? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":235,"nextTopicId":265}}
