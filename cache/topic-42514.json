Don&#39;t let it <br/>\nscare you &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will pick up arithmetic as they go about living their lives <br/>\n(arithmetic is everywhere) - they might have a few gaps, they might not <br/>\nlearn formal notation, but what they don&#39;t learn naturally is very easy <br/>\nto &quot;fill in&quot; if they have a need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  However, people do not pick up higher math (algebra and above) that <br/>\nway. Let&#39;s be honest about that, because if we&#39;re not, our credibility <br/>\nis shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several points that need to be made about higher math, though:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, not everybody needs to know very much about algebra, <br/>\ntrigonometry, or calculus or even formal geometry. And certainly kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to know it just for the sake of knowing it. The rationales <br/>\noffered for making everyone take algebra are that it is the &quot;language of <br/>\nscience&quot; and that it develops thinking skills. Both are bogus reasons. <br/>\nYes, algebra is used BY many scientists, but it isn&#39;t the language that <br/>\nis used to explain that science to the rest of us. If they decide to go <br/>\ninto science, they&#39;ll need some algebra. There is<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, algebra is currently a &quot;gateway&quot; course - the filter that keeps <br/>\nsome people from getting into or through college and makes college <br/>\ndegrees more scarce and therefore more valuable. So, if college ends up <br/>\nbeing on the path a person wants to follow, formal algebra is probably <br/>\ngoing to be required (not absolutely always, but usually).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf and when that time for algebra arrives, it is very possible for a <br/>\nperson to go over all the arithmetic needed and fill in the gaps and <br/>\nlearn the notation. There are lots of ways to do that - anything from <br/>\nusing a textbook, an online program, a tutor, a video course, a tutor, a <br/>\nclassroom course, and more. It could take a few weeks or a few months or <br/>\neven a year, depending on how much time the person puts into it. And, <br/>\nthen, they can learn algebra in any of the same ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy three daughters did no formal math at all until they were in college. <br/>\nThey started at community college, which has no entrance requirements. <br/>\nThey had options - they could take a placement test and start the math <br/>\nsequence where the test placed them or they could start the math <br/>\nsequence at the beginning. I recommended they do a little studying on <br/>\ntheir own and take the placement test so that they could skip some of <br/>\nthe courses, but they each opted to start the sequence at the beginning, <br/>\nbecause they felt uncomfortable about all the formal notation. The <br/>\noldest finished the sequence with Algebra 2 and then probability and <br/>\nstatistics. She went on to get a bachelors degree and took a couple more <br/>\nstatistics/research methods courses including being invited to take a <br/>\ngraduate-level course when she was still a college senior. She got A&#39;s <br/>\nin all math courses, by the way.  My second daughter followed the same <br/>\nroute and finished algebra 2 and is now taking statistics. Daughter <br/>\nnumber 3 is in the course right before algebra, right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people in these math classes with my daughters have almost all gone <br/>\nto school and taken (suffered through) years and years of math <br/>\ninstruction. My kids never suffered through one minute of it and there <br/>\nthey are in the same classes getting among the highest grades in the <br/>\ncourse, no less.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When spouses have different [major] opinions","postDate":"1235629910","msgId":42580,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5QTYzNzU2LjkwMTAzMDJAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvNTB1Mysxajd1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdvNTB1Mysxajd1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42563,"nextInTopic":42581,"prevInTime":42579,"nextInTime":42581,"topicId":42514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Claire is my oldest dd from my <br/>\nprevious marriage.  She&#39;s been living with us for 2 years now.  Her <br/>\ndad and stepmom are both teachers and have taught her that formal <br/>\nschool is very important.  She went to public high school the first 2 <br/>\nyears she lived with us but chose to stay home this year, which would <br/>\nbe her junior year.  She chose to enroll in a high school <br/>\ncorrespondence program because her dad was already freaked out that <br/>\nshe was quitting high school.  But she hasn&#39;t really been working on <br/>\nthe high school stuff.  She hates it.  My husband, her stepdad, <br/>\nthinks she is so close to finishing her high school diploma that she <br/>\nshould just buckle down and do it.  I posted about this whole dilemma <br/>\nrecently.  She was just about to take a break from all thoughts of <br/>\nschool when she came down with Mono last week.  So now she really <br/>\ndoes have an excuse as to why she isn&#39;t even thinking about school <br/>\nand her dad isn&#39;t bugging her about school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMartin and I have homeschooled our 2 children, Jeffrey and Allison, <br/>\nfor 7 years now.  We&#39;ve used curriculum in the past but I always went <br/>\nback to unschooling.  Martin read the unschooling books with me and <br/>\nstill believes it&#39;s a great lifestyle.  But he&#39;s gotten stuck in that <br/>\nold belief that there are some things that need formal structure, <br/>\nlike mathematics.  He&#39;s not 100% into the curriculum.  I mean, he&#39;s <br/>\nnot wanting them to do every page.  He is hoping some of the topics <br/>\nwill spark their interest in academic subjects.  And he&#39;s thinking <br/>\nthat it would be good if they earned an accredited high school <br/>\ndiploma.  That&#39;s why I think this was all brought on by Claire&#39;s high <br/>\nschool dilemma.

Was Claire  <br/>\nunschooled too?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen spouses have different opinions, unschool&#39;s pretty likely to lose  <br/>\nout.  That&#39;s why I like the analogy to owning a yacht.  Some people  <br/>\ncan even build a yacht, but in no case is a casual decision to have  <br/>\none, nor can if be done by one spouse with the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is such a big deal that it doesn&#39;t make sense to ask what  <br/>\nwill happen if one wants to and the other doesn&#39;t.  If I wrote &quot;I  <br/>\nwould like for our family to live in Japan, but Keith thinks we should  <br/>\nstay in our own house in the U.S.&quot;<br/>\nWhat could the advice possibly be?  I cannot have an unschooling  <br/>\nfamily if the father says not, or won&#39;t go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When spouses have different [major] opinions","postDate":"1235603437","msgId":42520,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5QTVDRkVELjkwMTAzMDJAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvNGk4MitiaGEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdvNGk4MitiaGEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42514,"nextInTopic":42521,"prevInTime":42519,"nextInTime":42521,"topicId":42514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
