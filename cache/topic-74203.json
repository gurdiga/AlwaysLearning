She knows why &nbsp;I might make a suggestion, we have discussed what is appropriate for time,place, etc. so I would probably say that I trust her choices, that if something seemed off, we would discuss it. In our family there are not &quot;battles&quot; over anything, thankfully, and we value being honest and thoughtful. Maybe it would help to compare, with her, the lifestyle differences between other families and yours. Not to deride the others, but to help her see why the things which create such issues are not a part of your lives. It really goes back to that history of trust and honesty, being reliable and trustworthy, kind and loving, that I find has made the bond strong between myself and my sixteen year old girl. She has only confided to me how sad she feels when her friends (or their parents or siblings!) are disrespectful to each other. She pretty much sees the value of why we live the way we do, why we work hard to protect the peace and security we have. She has also thanked my for not being like the other moms, which feels good....that positive feedback from her.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"jo2171","from":"jo2171 &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;You don&#39;t care what I wear&quot;","postDate":"1399151397","msgId":74204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVCN0QxOTgzLTJCMjYtNEEzMy1BNUU3LTI1RTE3MUVFRkE3M0B5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxrM2gzbytwNDVrcmpAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxrM2gzbytwNDVrcmpAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74203,"nextInTopic":74206,"prevInTime":74203,"nextInTime":74205,"topicId":74203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Michelle, have you tried talking to her?, could you ask her if she Really thinks you don t care?
