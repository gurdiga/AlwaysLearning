Once you&#39;re away from school thinking, it becomes clearer that the kids in school are the ones in an unnatural social environment. When else in life are you trapped with 30 people of the same age for 6 hours a day with no way to escape? In the real world, we get to choose friends based on interest. And that&#39;s what unschoolers get to do. There are classes and park days and online friends and people of all ages that homeschoolers interact with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that it&#39;s easy for all homeschooled kids to find friends. It can be hard. But I think adults idealize school and think being with all those kids solves all their social needs when for too many kids the friendships formed are more for convenience than because the kids actually like each other. Too often kids have to change who they are to fit in. My friends in school were more based on similar temperaments than because we had anything else in common. Being a girl into science fiction and engineering, there just weren&#39;t any others with similar interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor introverted kids being forced to be social all day with people you share nothing with other than age is a huge stressor. In real life we get to choose the type of work we do and the company we work for so that it better matches our needs. And if we find there are insolvable problems we always know we can search for a new job. Not so kids in school. They&#39;re stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has had the freedom to blossom at her own pace, find friends she really clicked with, has gotten to know her social needs and listen to what she needs not warp herself into socialization imposed on her. She&#39;s very comfortable in her own skin and has friends all over the world she&#39;s met through her interests in music and art. (And liking to draw &#39;80s hair metal bands is way more esoteric than science fiction but she&#39;s found a lot more friends than I had surrounded by kids in school. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403507483,"authorName":"katiescarlet02","from":"&quot;katiescarlet02&quot; &lt;katiescarlet02@...&gt;","profile":"katiescarlet02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New member","postDate":"1251260087","msgId":46896,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3MmNybitoMmIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46900,"prevInTime":46895,"nextInTime":46897,"topicId":46896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, I m new here.
