It was so beautiful and cute.  It was about<br/>\n  the antics of &quot;little loves&quot; (little creatures he<br/>\n  illustrated with hearts with legs and happy faces).  I<br/>\n  was So enchanted when he showed me.  So Delighted, so<br/>\n  happy...he did it on his own....entirely.  Then.  I<br/>\n  STUPIDED OUT.

She was <br/>\nvery young (21 when I was born) and this was the 50&#39;s and kids and adults <br/>\nlived more separate lives. They were like the adults in the Rugrats -sort of <br/>\nseen as helpful and sometimes demanding, but not entirely &quot;real&quot;. I think <br/>\nthere was a certain amount of &quot;benign neglect&quot; only because it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nexpected that adults would organize children&#39;s time for them or interfere in <br/>\ntheir play. School in the 50&#39;s was pretty calm -- they didn&#39;t expect kids to <br/>\neven begin to learn to read until 2nd grade, when the Dick and Jane big books <br/>\nwere used. Kindergarten was only a half day and we played house and blocks <br/>\nand visited the dairy and the airport and the fire department. We still had <br/>\nnaptime on mats on the floor in 1st grade. We didn&#39;t have any homework until <br/>\n7th grade. We had a few afterschool activities - a dance/etiquette class and <br/>\nBrownies/Girl Scouts and music lessons starting when we were around 10 or so. <br/>\nThere were no organized sports for girls. I ran all the way home from school <br/>\nevery day and changed clothes (we had to wear dresses to school, of course) <br/>\nand I had a quick snack and went out to play with whatever kids were <br/>\navailable -- there were LOTS of kids in our neighborhood and we could ride <br/>\nour bikes anywhere for blocks around including the local schools, shopping <br/>\ncenter, and vacant lots. Or we&#39;d go inside someone&#39;s house and play games or <br/>\nplay dolls or whatever. I spent a LOT of time playing various forms of bat <br/>\nand ball games out in the street. There was pretty much always a game going <br/>\non out there. Boys and girls played together. Sometimes I played by myself <br/>\nbecause I wanted to -- skating around and around on our big driveway or <br/>\nreading a book up in a tree. I always felt like we had LOTS of time to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents didn&#39;t do much with us on a daily basis, except feed us and make <br/>\nus take baths before bed - they mostly just let us be kids. We went to the <br/>\nbeach during the summer, we took a short vacation every once in a while, and <br/>\nwe went to Disneyland on my birthday. Once we went to the mountains to see <br/>\nsnow (less than 2 hours from home). But really we didn&#39;t do much. Our house <br/>\nwas FILLED with books, though, and my parents read a lot. My grandparents <br/>\nlived in exotic places - like Libya and then Iran and then Turkey. They <br/>\nstored some stuff in our garage - dressers with drawers FILLED with seashells <br/>\n- I spent hours handling them and looking them up in field guides. They&#39;d <br/>\nalso stored a filing cabinet that was filled with articles torn from <br/>\nmagazines and newspapers - no photocopiers, remember? My grandparents had <br/>\nsimply torn out any article that they thought was interesting and filed it <br/>\nunder subject headings. I used to just pull random articles out and read <br/>\nabout all different kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what we had was the gift of huge amounts of free time with no adults <br/>\nlooking over our shoulders. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4635099,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;Felicitas@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting out of the way","postDate":"1009668769","msgId":1853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4NTM5MkEwLjIwMzg3JUZlbGljaXRhc0BNYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDExMjI5MTUzNTA4LjY3NzU4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1826,"nextInTopic":1866,"prevInTime":1852,"nextInTime":1854,"topicId":1802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  ...

People think that we discipline them.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1574228479\">Getting Out of the Way <br/>\n<br/>\nBy Naomi Aldort <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are often complimented on our children&#39;s <br/>\nbehavior and <br/>\ndemeanor. People think that we discipline them. We don&#39;t. It is <br/>\nourselves we <br/>\ndiscipline. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe meet our children&#39;s needs, provide for their protection, and <br/>\nexpose them <br/>\nto life&#39;s possibilities. We do not, however, meddle in their play, <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nlearning, their creativity, or any other form of growth. We love, <br/>\nhug, feed, <br/>\nshare, listen, respond, and participate when asked. Yet, we keep <br/>\nour <br/>\nchildren free of insult and manipulation resulting from &quot;helpful&quot; <br/>\ncomments <br/>\nand ideas - influences to which children are so sensitive in their <br/>\nstate of <br/>\ndependency. <br/>\n<br/>\nParental Self-Discipline <br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of discipline is not easy. Not only does our society not <br/>\nsupport <br/>\nit, but the temptation to break the &quot;rules&quot; lives within us. The drive <br/>\nto <br/>\nintervene in children&#39;s activities is rooted in our upbringing and <br/>\nreinforced in our culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the most difficult challenge to overcome has been a <br/>\nnarcissistic <br/>\nimpulse to show off my children. One day, when our oldest child <br/>\nwas two <br/>\nyears old, he played a smooth scale on the piano. I was amazed, <br/>\nyet held <br/>\nfast to my rule and stayed out of his way. Free to play out of his <br/>\nown love <br/>\nand interest, and not to gratify me, he went on improving his <br/>\nscale with <br/>\ntremendous joy and concentration for quite some time. Not until <br/>\nmy husband <br/>\ncame home did I fall into the trap. Unable to wait for a repeat <br/>\nperformance <br/>\nin its own time, I covertly tried to direct our son to the piano to do <br/>\nhis <br/>\n&quot;trick.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUntrained in doing for the sake of pleasing, he was not fooled. <br/>\nHe sensed <br/>\nthe hoax and refused to play. Several weeks passed before he <br/>\nagain immersed <br/>\nhimself in the scale. This child loves to do things for others, <br/>\nenjoys <br/>\nhelping and serving; yet, when he does something out of self-<br/>\ninterest, that <br/>\nis how it must remain. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the self-discipline required of a parent is often <br/>\nchallenging, it <br/>\nbecomes second nature with time and experience. For me, this <br/>\ntype of <br/>\ndiscipline developed gradually, beginning with &quot;descriptive <br/>\nacknowledgment&quot;1 <br/>\nand culminating in unadulterated staying-out-of-the-way a few <br/>\nyears later. <br/>\nMy best allies have been my realizations as a mother and <br/>\neducator, Daniel <br/>\nGreenberg&#39;s book Free at Last, and discussions with Jean <br/>\nLiedloff, author of <br/>\nThe Continuum Concept, about letting children be themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, I thought that commenting, acknowledging, and praising <br/>\nchildren <br/>\nfor their achievements express love and build self-esteem. In <br/>\ntime, I <br/>\nrealized that these well-intended interventions do just the <br/>\nopposite: they <br/>\nfoster dependency on external validation and undermine the <br/>\nchildren&#39;s trust <br/>\nin themselves. Children who are subjected to endless <br/>\ncommentary, <br/>\nacknowledgment, and praise eventually learn to do things not for <br/>\ntheir own <br/>\nsake, but to please others. Gratifying others soon becomes their <br/>\nprimary <br/>\nmotivation, replacing impulses stemming from the authentic self <br/>\nand leading <br/>\nto its loss. <br/>\n<br/>\nContrary to common belief, children feel more loved and self-<br/>\nassured when we <br/>\ndo not intervene in their activities. Not only do they remain secure <br/>\nin our <br/>\nlove and support when we refrain from intervening, but they need <br/>\nus to <br/>\nprotect them from these intrusions, which can interfere with their <br/>\nprogress, <br/>\nself-reliance, and emotional well-being. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we intervene with praise, wants, advice, and rewards, <br/>\ndoubts sneak in <br/>\nand shake loose our children&#39;s trust in themselves and in us. <br/>\nSensitive and <br/>\nsmart, they perceive that we have an agenda - that we are <br/>\nmanipulating them <br/>\ntoward some preferred or &quot;improved&quot; end result. This <br/>\nawareness gets them <br/>\nthinking: &quot;Perhaps what I am trying to achieve is wrong - I can&#39;t <br/>\ntrust <br/>\nmyself to know or choose,&quot; or &quot;Mom and Dad have an agenda <br/>\nthat I must <br/>\nfulfill if I am to have their approval and their love.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nGradually, a shift occurs. Children who were once doing for the <br/>\nsake of <br/>\npersonal pleasure or understanding begin doing for the sake of <br/>\npleasing. No <br/>\nlonger do they trust in their actions, and no longer do they trust <br/>\nus, for <br/>\nwe are not really on their side. Along with the shift to pleasing us <br/>\ncomes <br/>\nthe fear of not pleasing us. Emotional and intellectual <br/>\ndependency, low <br/>\nself-esteem, and lack of self-confidence invariably follow. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven when we intervene with casual commentary on our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s imaginative <br/>\nplay, doubts sneak in. What children are experiencing inwardly at <br/>\nthese <br/>\ntimes is so often remote from our &quot;educated&quot; guesses that <br/>\nbewilderment soon <br/>\nturns to self-denial and self-doubt. Moreover, children perceive <br/>\nthe phony <br/>\nand patronizing remarks for what they are, and may conclude <br/>\nthat it is OK to <br/>\nbe insincere and pretentious. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Praising to Observing <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is difficult to stop dishing out praise. For one thing, we are <br/>\nhooked on <br/>\nour conditioning as well as on the &quot;hard sell&quot; of the holy cow <br/>\ncalled <br/>\nPraise. For another, we are easily misled: the praised-for-every-<br/>\nachievement <br/>\nchild seems like a happy, successful, highly self-esteemed <br/>\nchild. In <br/>\nreality, such a child has shifted to the pleasing mode, driven to <br/>\nsuccess <br/>\nnot by personal curiosity or delight, but by the desire to oblige us <br/>\nand <br/>\nlive up to our expectations. As educator John Holt has said of <br/>\nchildren, <br/>\n&quot;They are afraid, above all else, of failing, of disappointing or <br/>\ndispleasing the many anxious adults around them, whose <br/>\nlimitless hopes and <br/>\nexpectations for them hang over their heads like a cloud.&quot;2 In <br/>\nshort, the <br/>\nesteem we notice is not self-esteem, for the self has been lost in <br/>\nthe early <br/>\nyears of this type of conditioning. The happiness we see is not <br/>\npleasure, <br/>\nbut rather relief that another pleasing act has been <br/>\naccomplished, securing <br/>\nparental approval (emotional survival) and concealing a feeling <br/>\nof deep <br/>\nloss. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren, too, can be fooled into believing that these pleasing <br/>\nbehaviors <br/>\noriginate within and have everything to do with who they are. The <br/>\nultimate <br/>\ndeception comes when children grow up to become seemingly <br/>\naccomplished and <br/>\nhappy adults. Psychoanalyst Alice Miller, in her book The Drama <br/>\nof the <br/>\nGifted Child, gives voice to the lamentable conviction that arises: <br/>\n&quot;Without <br/>\nthese achievements, these gifts, I could never be loved.... <br/>\nWithout these <br/>\nqualities, which I have, a person is completely worthless.&quot; Miller <br/>\ngoes on <br/>\nto explain why achievement based on pleasing denies self-<br/>\nunderstanding and, <br/>\nin so doing, leads to depression, feelings of &#39;never enough&#39;, and <br/>\nother <br/>\nemotional disturbances in often the most successful people.3 <br/>\n<br/>\nTo &quot;follow one&#39;s own drummer&quot;, a person needs to exercise the <br/>\nmuscles of <br/>\nfree choice and self-learning from the start. The difficulty we have <br/>\nin <br/>\ntrusting our children&#39;s ability to flex these muscles stems from <br/>\nour own <br/>\nexperience of not having been trusted. Trusting is, simply, not <br/>\nnatural to <br/>\nus. Only as we make a concerted effort to get out - and stay out - <br/>\nof our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s way do we discover the wonderful truth: the magic is <br/>\nalready in <br/>\nour children, ready to unfold in its own way and in its own time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNearly every child comes to life equipped with a self that is <br/>\ncapable of <br/>\nblooming to capacity. Unhindered in its growth, this self will lead <br/>\nthe <br/>\nchild to skills and knowledge and, in the process, self-<br/>\nactualization. We <br/>\nhave no right to attempt to control the direction of this growth. <br/>\nInstead of <br/>\ntraining our children through various forms of intervention to fit <br/>\nour <br/>\nvision for them, we need to train ourselves to respect nature&#39;s <br/>\ncreation and <br/>\nto safeguard its full, authentic bloom. <br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, the end result we are looking for - an able, highly self-<br/>\nesteemed, <br/>\ncreative, curious, and responsible human being - is already <br/>\nobservable in a <br/>\ntwo-year-old child.4 Allowed to put these gifts to use in a self-<br/>\ndirected, <br/>\nself-trusting way, the youngster will develop capabilities while <br/>\nenhancing <br/>\nthese desirable qualities. Maturation will then come as an <br/>\nauthentic <br/>\nexpression of the self, rather than as an appeasement to <br/>\nparental authority <br/>\nand other forms of domination. <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting out of the way gives us an opportunity to become curious <br/>\nobservers. <br/>\nAt the same time, it frees us of power struggles and initiates an <br/>\napproach <br/>\nto parenthood that is infinitely more enjoyable and fulfilling. I <br/>\nknow of no <br/>\nmore interesting, engaging, fascinating, and glorious <br/>\n&quot;entertainment&quot; in <br/>\nlife than watching children unfold freely.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2018,"nextTopicId":2045}}
