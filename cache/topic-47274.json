( I work based out of a church with inner-city youth with substance abuse issues).  While there, Dr. Wes Stafford spoke about the sexual, mental and physical abuse he endured in Africa at the hands of his Christian Missionary teachers.  He was told that if he spoke of the abuse, he would be responsible for thousands of African children going to hell.  This abuse would have taken place in the 1950s I think.  Dr Stafford had a lot to say about the abuse of power in the name of Christianity.  He has a book out called Too Small to Ignore.

He is appalled that so many children in North America and Europe are completely disconnected from their parents&#39; livlihoods.  He feels that many children and youths today feel no sense of purpose. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend checking out his book for anyone willing to admit that Christians do not have a squeaky clean story and are willing to move forward and learn from the past.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMel</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: odd article","postDate":"1253566994","msgId":47540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxM0FDNkQyLTM4MUItNDQ1Ni1BNzhELURENjU2NTZBNjlFQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzOTg4LjI4NTc3LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDMzMzM4NzIyLjM1MDQyNzEyNTM1MDI5MTYyMzQuSmF2YU1haWwucm9vdEBzejAwNTJhLmVtZXJ5dmlsbGUuY2EubWFpbC5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDgzOTg4LjI4NTc3LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47539,"nextInTopic":47543,"prevInTime":47539,"nextInTime":47541,"topicId":47274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I believe (from what the Bible teaches) He made the world to be explored and enjoyed. -=-I suppose it depends on which part of the bible you read. -=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-86888111\">-=-&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe (from what the Bible teaches) He made the world to be  <br/>\nexplored and enjoyed.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I suppose it depends on which part of the bible you read. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, and the Garden of Eden is hard to interpret in an unschooling- <br/>\nfriendly way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wanted to explore and enjoy?

The Bible sits there. People read it and tell others what they think it means. Some people decide they know for sure what it means and try to get others to believe their interpretation is right. That&#39;s true whether someone is totally off base or whether there&#39;s actually someone who is spot on in having deciphered the mind of God (if He exists and if the Bible is His instruction book.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat got me thinking whether a book can teach. I&#39;m thinking teachers only teach if the knowledge they&#39;re trying to impart actually gets learned by someone. If they&#39;re up there blathering away and no one takes in what they intended for them to take in, they haven&#39;t taught. Any knowledge picked up without the intent to impart it, a teacher can&#39;t take credit for having taught. A book can&#39;t have intent. The author or a teacher can have intent and use a book as the medium to impart knowledge, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo God can use his textbook to try to teach but we don&#39;t know if anyone has ever actually learned what God intended anyone to learn. Far as I know God doesn&#39;t hand out report cards. Though many people claim he does. It&#39;s a pass/fail or Heaven/Oblivion (or Heaven/Hell. Some say they&#39;re the same.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lots of interpreters of God&#39;s textbook try to teach and lots of people learn what the interpreters intend to impart but whether the interpreters interpreted properly, we can&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Those supposed Christians were in error, totally misrepresenting God&#39;s heart on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m getting flashbacks to the homeschooling forums on AOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They&#39;re wrong!

Skeptics are cool.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my opinion<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There can&#39;t be anything else about God&#39;s ideas since He&#39;s not here to correct anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t know the mind of John Holt either since he&#39;s just as absent! All we have are opinions of what he meant. But at least he&#39;s a contemporary of some of us so we know the culture and mindset he was talking about. But his contemporary status is slowly fading. He didn&#39;t live in a world of 1000 TV channels and unlimited internet access. Sometimes it strikes me that a hundred years from now (I hope it&#39;s less but suspect it will be more) that people won&#39;t be able to grasp the mental and emotional stranglehold the idea that expert strangers could raise children better than parents had on our society. They won&#39;t understand the sacrifices parents were willing to make -- especially in their relationships with their children, in order to get for their children what the stranger experts offered. They&#39;ll think those parents were idiots. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd fortunately it isn&#39;t necessary to understand John Holt&#39;s mind in order to unschool. He just described what existed naturally and gave it a name. We can make the same observations he did and see the same things. We don&#39;t need his writings to see how kids naturally learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not so easy to say about the Bible written to be understood by subsistence farmers and herders in the Middle East thousands of years ago. Misunderstanding should be accepted as a given.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe (from what the Bible teaches) He made the world to be explored and enjoyed. <br/>\n&gt; I believe God is the author of unschooling. <br/>\n&gt; We are told in His Word to &quot;train our children as we walk along the road&quot; - daily living kind of personal contact and nuturing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.--Psalms 137:9&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a good page of quotes from the Skeptics Annotated Bible:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/children.html\">http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/children.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(Admittedly that&#39;s a load of bad stuff. I assume there&#39;s good stuff too. Which doesn&#39;t make it any less contradictory.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so that you didn&#39;t think that all Christians believe that curiosity is sinful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is there one thing that all Christians believe? Maybe that Jesus was the son of God and he died for our sins. But I wouldn&#39;t bet the house on that. And I bet there are sects willing to argue every other point of what God supposedly really wants. Anyone who believes blanket statements about what all Christians believe hasn&#39;t been out in the world much ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People confuse the good and the bad in our human nature and want to call all things<br/>\n&gt; from our human nature sinful.  It just isn&#39;t true.  There is so much misinformation out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*I* believe, *my* opinion, *I* think, that what is thought of as sin or our struggle between good and evil is because we didn&#39;t throw away the brains our ancient ancestors began with. We didn&#39;t start from scratch. We still have fishy lizard brains that *know* that unless you&#39;re selfish and grab the best for yourself you&#39;re not going to survive. That is Truth to our fishy ancestors. Tigers still know that&#39;s Truth. (Unless they&#39;re mom Tigers with babies, then grab the best for yourself and your babies overrides it temporarily.) But as we evolved, we overlaid that brain with other brains with conflicting ideas, like cooperate with someone and one plus one adds up to more than two and you&#39;re both more likely to survive. But the old ideas are still there. And still valid in some contexts. We just have to struggle at figuring out which is optimal and when. It&#39;s not sinful or evil to be a lizard, but it doesn&#39;t help us grow relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s got ideas from Darwin in there and could just be more misinformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] history, religion (was Re: odd article","postDate":"1253564819","msgId":47537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGODA3MkJDLUJFQzAtNDE5Qy1BOThCLTZFQTQwOUUwQzQ4QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2ODMwNS41NDU1Mi5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDg2ODQ5MTYyNy4zNTIyNTMxMjUzNTA2Mzk5NjU5LkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAc3owMDUyYS5lbWVyeXZpbGxlLmNhLm1haWwuY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+PEEyNkRFNEEwLTA4MkMtNDUxNS1BMkE3LUVCNzI3MDI1MDAwQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzMTgwNDg1MjktMTI1MzU1NTg3Ny1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTg4NjE2ODAzMC1AYmRhNzQ2LmJpc3gucHJvZC5vbi5ibGFja2JlcnJ5PiA8RkY1Qzk3QzUtNDE5NC00OUMzLUE1NzQtQzNGNjNFODJGRTVGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NDY4MzA1LjU0NTUyLnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNC5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47535,"nextInTopic":47539,"prevInTime":47536,"nextInTime":47538,"topicId":47274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=You don t have to go to far in the past to see wrongs that happen in the name of religion.

I love history--the  \r<br/>\ncostumes, the furniture, carriages, boats, paintings, music...  but  \r<br/>\nsocial history is crucial to understanding where we are now.  Without  \r<br/>\nsome idea of how marriages were in the 1930&#39;s, 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, there  \r<br/>\ncan&#39;t be any real understanding of the changes the women&#39;s movement  \r<br/>\nmade in the U.S.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLately the feminism is big in Australia.
