Thanks Karen","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1674245282\">I&#39;m back from the dinner!  It drives me nuts that I get nervous over<br/>\nmaking a silly 3 minute award presentation speech, but it went well<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks Karen for giving a better explanation of guinea pig teeth than I<br/>\ncould have.  I wonder what Shyrley&#39;s secret is.  After many successful<br/>\nyears with many species of animals, we weren&#39;t terribly successful with<br/>\nguinea pigs.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn regard to rats, we had hooded rats - white with black, brown or gray<br/>\n&quot;hoods&quot; around their heads and a stripe going down their back to their<br/>\ntail.  Lest people think I&#39;m completely nuts, there&#39;s a reason we had 33<br/>\nrats at once.  We got two with the intention of having a litter.  Very<br/>\nquickly we had a litter of nine.  We kept all of them because everybody<br/>\nseemed grossed out by the idea of pet rats, so we couldn&#39;t find homes<br/>\nfor them and I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the idea of having a pet shop<br/>\nsell them.  We separated the two original rats so we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nanother litter, but they managed to get together through the wire of the<br/>\ncages when she was loose!  3 weeks later we had a litter of 14!  We<br/>\ndecided to take those to a really reputable pet shop for homes, but just<br/>\nbefore they were weaned and ready to go, we discovered that we&#39;d left<br/>\nthe first litter together a bit too long (they can conceive really<br/>\nyoung!), and we had another litter of 8!  We only had the 33 for about a<br/>\nweek, after which the litter of 14 was ready to go to the pet store.  We<br/>\nkept one from each of those 2 litters, so we ultimately ended up with<br/>\n13.  <br/>\nRats come in over 30 colors, including Dalmatian (yeah!), and I&#39;d like<br/>\nto eventually get some of the more exotic colors, but they&#39;re hard to<br/>\nget around here.  Most of the really interesting ones are bred in CA,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s very expensive to have them shipped.  The rat people sometimes<br/>\nsmuggle them by going through airport security with the rats in a zipped<br/>\njacket pocket, then transferring them to a container in the airplane<br/>\nbathroom and put them in a carry on bag for the ride.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood Dalmatians?  It&#39;s all about finding a really reputable breeder that<br/>\nbreeds for show purposes and makes a high priority of health and<br/>\ntemperament, testing all puppies for congenital deafness, euthanizing<br/>\nthe deaf puppies and neutering the unilateral hearing puppies.  All<br/>\nthree of our Dalmatians have really nice temperaments, though the breed<br/>\nreally does belong in families who like their personality traits -<br/>\nsilly, bouncy, demanding, kissy high energy, and very allergic to<br/>\nsleeping on hard surfaces!  Interestingly enough, after the second<br/>\nmovie, the Dalmatian clubs did such a good job of educating people about<br/>\nthe breed that it plummeted in AKC registrations.  It was good that<br/>\npeople didn&#39;t rush out to get them, but the rapid drop in popularity was<br/>\nreally hard on reputable breeders and show people.<br/>\n <br/>\nOut homeschool theatre group is called YPT (Young People&#39;s Theatre) and<br/>\nwas started several years ago by 2 moms.  One moved to Arkansas, and<br/>\nstill runs a branch there.  The other director has rehearsals at a<br/>\nchurch in Lakeridge, VA, and we hold our performances at Lazy Susan<br/>\nDinner Theatre.  We do 2 performances a year, and sometimes a summer<br/>\nshow.  This is our 3rd season with the group.  We&#39;ve done The Little<br/>\nPrince, Little Women of Orchard House, and now Fiddler, Jr.  Next season<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be doing Annie.  The quality is truly amazing.  Our director<br/>\nattends to every little detail and the shows are incredibly<br/>\nprofessional!
