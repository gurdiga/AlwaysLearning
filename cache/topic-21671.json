I&#39;m a mother of 4 - mostly unschooled all <br/>\nof them, but not without alot of anguish of whether or not they are &quot;missing <br/>\nsomething&quot;.  I am also a trained Montessori 3-6 directress.  Right now, I have a <br/>\nsoon to be 16 yr. old boy who hates absolutely anything to do with paper and <br/>\npencil.  He e-mails his girlfriend.  That is it.    Do I need to be concerned? <br/>\n He wants to go to college to be a Conservation Officer, but I also believe <br/>\nhe has a negative belief in himself about doing homework from the days/years of <br/>\nme wigging out.  Thanks for any encouragement/ideas you can give me.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response (and I&#39;ve invited her to join this list):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest just went to his first college classes.  His handwriting is tiny <br/>\nlittle printing.  He will get better from doing it.  This is the first time he&#39;s <br/>\nreally needed to.  I figure it will be that way with your son, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21657,"nextTopicId":21658}}
