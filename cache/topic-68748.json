That is true... Maybe. Honestly, i&#39;m<br/>\nnot so sure. Bear with me here...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to articulate, but i don&#39;t seem to think of rules as,<br/>\nwell, rules. In fact, i don&#39;t think of them much. I do get really upset<br/>\nwhen people don&#39;t act as i think they should (ie: standing up for what they<br/>\nbelieve in), but that&#39;s different . . . or is it? I guess the fundamental<br/>\ntruth about *any* rule is that it only really exists in the heads of those<br/>\nmaking, interpreting, or imagining them. Many to most written laws never<br/>\nget enforced at all, and the rest of them are subjectively interpreted by<br/>\nreal people in real time - often in opposition to the original intent!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is to remind parents not to underestimate your unschooler&#39;s (and<br/>\nyour own) ability to think creatively and find people with power to help<br/>\nyou get what you want. This does not have to include lying or cheating,<br/>\nthough it might include highlighting various aspects of the truth most<br/>\npalatable to the dominant culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sort of diploma program might be one creative way to do this. Making<br/>\nyour own &quot;diploma&quot; might be another. Sweet talking someone into letting you<br/>\nin on the secret word to write in that slot that will let you by<br/>\nno-questions-asked might be another. Asking to be tested instead might be<br/>\nanother. Designing a power-point lecture or mini one-act play or act of<br/>\nmathematical genius or musical revue or homemade film documentary and<br/>\nshowing it to the Dean might be another. Showing up at a school-board<br/>\nmeeting with irresistibly cute signs made by kindergartners (done it -<br/>\nthough it didn&#39;t work as well as i&#39;d hoped) might be another strategy to<br/>\ntry out. Writing a killer essay sometimes works. Getting overrides from<br/>\nspecific teachers once you&#39;ve had a chance to impress them might be<br/>\nanother. Making up your &quot;homeschool&#39;s&quot; name and hoping they don&#39;t actually<br/>\nlook it up (while still prepared to defend it) is an option too - most<br/>\ndatabases are shockingly out of date and folks rarely look up anything they<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of a fancy-looking signature,<br/>\neven if it&#39;s your mom&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter years of dealing with US bureaucracy over many issues, and some<br/>\nexperience with that of Thailand and New Zealand, my experience has been<br/>\nthat the human beings (administrators, bureaucrats, etc) standing between i<br/>\nand my goal have enormous power to put things through or stop them; my<br/>\ntreating them with respect, understanding, an expectation of success and<br/>\ngood cheer has caused all kinds of &quot;hard and fast&quot; rules to melt into<br/>\nnothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am of the (unsubstantiated) opinion that my unschooling attitude of<br/>\ncreatively tackling goals - thinking outside the box, if you will - has had<br/>\na lot to do with this, as does my relative confidence built by successfully<br/>\nsurmounting many obstacles throughout childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, i personally have yet to find a &quot;requirement&quot; that can&#39;t be<br/>\nunmasked as a &quot;guideline&quot; -- or vice-verse if i&#39;ve gotten on someone&#39;s bad<br/>\nside. I have been known to beg out of a conversation and come back later to<br/>\nget a different person and try again. (Though i must admit i&#39;ve never tried<br/>\nto cheat on my taxes, sell drugs, plagiarize, launder money or participate<br/>\nin other ethically questionable acts of flaunting the law - perhaps i&#39;d<br/>\nhave a much different experience!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that making decisions out of a fear that i&#39;ll get in trouble<br/>\nlater if i don&#39;t has rarely worked out well.

I have worked, gone to college twice, and done all sorts of interesting things in the 15 years since my teenhood, and despite listening to lots of folks tell me i&#39;d need a diploma, it has *never once* been even a momentary problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know more, here&#39;s how i dealt with it:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile a teen, i enrolled in a local high school in order to take advantage of a state program (Running Start, in WA) that allowed me to take community college classes for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i could no longer take what i wanted and needed, i called my high school and told them they were fired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i wanted to go back to this college later, i enrolled as a &quot;returning student&quot; and no-one ever asked for a diploma.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i have had to fill out forms asking about my education level, i write &quot;some college.&quot; Anyone could write this - i have never been asked for documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i have filled out forms asking about high school, i simply write in &quot;Homeschooled.&quot; Again, i have never once been asked for documentation of any kind. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been accepted to university by writing in &quot;homeschooled.&quot; They didn&#39;t even ask about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have filled out more forms in my life, for private and public institutions, than most people can shake a stick at, and have always gotten what i needed. I have also been honest, all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, it is always a real live person making the decision. My engaging attitude, confident eye contact, and articulate speaking - classic unschooler traits - have been my ticket to getting my needs met. Not a diploma.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf i got into a situation now where i needed a diploma, i&#39;d look some up online, write one that resonated with me and was true, name the school something awesome, and have my mom sign it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is helpful! <br/>\n-Bonny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Quick intro, since this is my first post: My name is Bonny Moss, i was homeschooled/unschooled my whole life - there wasn&#39;t much of a distinction in those days before curriculums - and am now unschooling my 8 year old and 10 month old, and thoroughly enjoying the conversation here! I am challenged and opened by the most radical of the thinking, but am frequently mystified by the way you all talk about things - until i remember that while you may be unschooling your own children, most of you went to compulsory education for many formative years and so have a fundamentally different approach to life than i. Anyway, THANK YOU ALL for taking the time to go into many of these issues with such vulnerability, passion, experience, and conviction! My children and i are the better for it and it brings tears to my eyes to find so many others who share my values! Your ability to articulate much of which is so deep in me that it is sub-verbal has brought it up to the level of my conscious mind and allowed me to examine my own thinking and effect profound and subtle change in my life.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: on starting a transcript documentation service-school","postDate":"1345990525","msgId":68789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsxZGIxdCs3amRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxYWZraytoMWw0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68782,"nextInTopic":68794,"prevInTime":68788,"nextInTime":68790,"topicId":68748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"== What I was doing here was exploring an idea of applying a very interesting (to me) ecological concept of top down and bottom up systems to education.

Teachers don&#39;t know more about teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they create jargon so that they feel educated and in the know and part of a profession with specialized knowledge.  If they use regular English, then ANYone could understand them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is best discussed in regular English.  If we and our children are going to be learning in natural ways from the real world, no veil of labels and secret terminology can help in any way.  Seeing directly is valuable in natural learning.  Seeing educationese is valuable to teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe offer of these &quot;transcript documentation&quot; is to turn real world into jargon, but it can still be done honestly.  And it would be good if it can be done without any adverse effect on the family and their unschooling.  Especially if a family is fairly new to unschooling, dealing with someone who doesn&#39;t understand unschooling can easily set them back, and they only have so many years to clearly understand unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools and jobs don&#39;t always actually need transcripts, either.   A letter stating that the person was homeschooled has gotten them past the alleged &quot;have to have&quot; point in hundreds of situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: on starting a transcript documentation service-school","postDate":"1345916688","msgId":68780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPa0d4d1cxQVdjemFoYy15bnZ3a1MrZD1ObTNjQkE9OExHVD00dUNrd3lGZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxYWZraytoMWw0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFCMUJBQkVFLUM5RUEtNDk0MS1COEEwLUNDQkFFMTkzNjE4NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGsxYWZraytoMWw0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68779,"nextInTopic":68781,"prevInTime":68779,"nextInTime":68781,"topicId":68748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1985215959\">What I was doing here was exploring an idea of applying a very interesting (to me) ecological concept of top down and bottom up systems to education. In ecology-  there are systems that are driven ecologically by &quot;bottom up&quot; forces- winds and nutrients and such providing the basis of an ecosystem, and systems driven by &quot;top down&quot; forces- sea otters eating sea urchins, allowing kelp forests to flourish.(predators drive the system).  One isn&#39;t better than the other they are just different, and in many many , actually most systems both types of interactions- nutrient availability and  predator prey relationships-- both do sort of a dance that create a healthy ecosystem when everything is in balance and result in ecological degradation when something in that dance is out of kilter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was suggesting that education itself was &quot;out of kilter&quot;- because most of society relies only on  top down educational forces defining education, and what I&#39;m offering in my school (and what Wes does) is a more bottom up approach to allowing kids to earn a high school diploma.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the idea of top down and bottom up systems,  I looked up top down bottom up learning on line- and got a scholarly paper (that made my eyes glaze over-- if you google that term you&#39;ll see what i mean) but what i got from the abstract was that top down meant explicit to implicit learning, and bottom up meant implicit to explicit learning-- that top down/ bottom up was actually in the educational literature.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo  moving away from education to just plain learning, I started thinking is there any value at all to &quot;top down&quot; explicit to implicit learning? I was just exploring an idea here.  And answering a question_ would I ever suggest or support explicit  to implicit learning experiences in my school? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see in the course of this conversation where my analogy breaks down and that&#39;s partially why I threw it out there.  I wanted it to get chewed up and mulled around. I agree that learning itself isn&#39;t linear and doesn&#39;t only go in two directions- it&#39;s  much more of a spiral multi dimensional process-- that takes place through playing, discussing, watching, reading, singing, acting, more playing, listening, climbing over, taking a class, teaching a class, learning from a friend,analyzing, experimenting, more playing, dancing,etc.... And yes there would be times when I would encourage a student to follow his passions and work with a particular mentor or take a particular class if I saw him looking for something like that. Whether that is top down or bottom up or  implicit or explicit is a bit irrelevant- I see that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still like my analogy to explain to my science-friends who basically regular school their kids-It helps them understand what I&#39;m trying to do offering a bottom up approach to education. (not learning) It works for me with particular people. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I analyze my own intelligences, linguistic facility is not my strongest point (which may be apparent by my posts : ))- I&#39;m not terrible at it, though,  and have found  ways to use &quot;educationalese&quot; words to describe what homeschoolers/unschooers have done in the past for the purpose of writing transcripts. So I have given credits to kids who played hours of video games and called it a &quot;class&quot; because I was in a system that in order to give credits- you assign credits to a &quot;class.&quot;  I have a fairly long history of doing this kind of &quot;subversive&quot; activity in a charter school, and never felt it fraudulent-- because I knew that kids  learned from activities that the regular school system would not give them credits for. I was in the system- and believed / knew they deserved credits for learning.   I have always supported unschoolers in our particular charter school system. I don&#39;t think anyone has ever found me hostile or at all unsupportive to unschooling- <br/>\n<br/>\nLinguistic facility is not my strongest intelligence,  but intrapersonal is. And I know myself. I know that I support and understand unschooling (maybe not perfectly- but pretty darn well). And in the new school I&#39;m pursuing,  unschoolers would feel supported- and if they didn&#39;t I would be open to learning from them and hearing their criticism.  Perhaps I  have used words or terms in this discussion which may lead some people to think I don&#39;t understand unschooling. And I&#39;m OK with seeing the holes- because  when I see my shortcomings , I&#39;m pretty good and shoring them up and getting stronger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that roaming the world with curiosity and joy isn&#39;t bottom up learning. &quot;Bottom up learning&quot; is too narrow a term for curiosity and joy. I see that.   But I&#39;m trying to create a school (and a system) that offers a high school diploma and a transcript (if they want)to kids who roam the world with curiosity and joy, or who WANT the opportunity to roam the world with curiosity and joy, but for whom  high school requirements stand in the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that makes sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Thinking of how unschooled kids learn as either &quot;bottom up&quot; (on their own)<br/>\n&gt; versus top-down (being taught) isn&#39;t a helpful way to better understand<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.

Neither of us was bottom or top.  It was flowing back and forth on the same level.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To refer to what unschoolers do as &quot;bottom up&quot; puts natural learning on the bottom.  Why?

Information prescribed and &quot;taught&quot; so that someone can pass a test isn&#39;t &quot;top down&quot; in any moral or logical way.   The history and mythology of our language and culture has heaven at top (God, angels) and evil at bottom (ignorance, devils, hell).

We played with some of Holly&#39;s friends this weekend, I showed them to a couple of Pam&#39;s kids early last month, and some people in Europe last summer. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people have shown me their games, and they showed me because they were excited about them.  Neither of us was bottom or top.  It was flowing back and forth on the same level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo refer to what unschoolers do as &quot;bottom up&quot; puts natural learning on the bottom.  Why?  It&#39;s a good model to abandon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, school subject matter is the bottom, the shallow pond of prescribed knowledge schools have changed only gradually over the past hundred years.  School kids are pressed to wade in that, to stay in and around that.  Unschoolers are living up and away from it entirely, though the important and fun parts are available and accessible in a thousand different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned some about WWII this summer that I hadn&#39;t known, because I was given a tile as a gift.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/leiden/tile\">http://sandradodd.com/leiden/tile</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I read those stories I followed them to others, and then talked to people there who had other information, about bicycles having been taken away by the Nazis, in the Netherlands.  That was learned eagerly, and nobody taught me.  I didn&#39;t need to know, I just wanted to know.  It&#39;s not something that was ever mentioned to me in any history class, so does that mean it&#39;s not important?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can learn about WWII if they make quilts with airplanes on them, or if they&#39;re interested in the history of military uniforms or tank technology, or popular music, hairstyles, motorcycles, cellulose leather-substitutes (early &quot;naugahyde&quot; type  material, and vinyl replacements for &quot;oil cloth&quot;), tents, aluminum or stainless steel used in dishes, forks, spoons, airplanes.   Quanset huts (I passed by two of them yesterday, in an older part of Albuquerque).  Those are not things school will teach, but they are knowledge that other knowledge can be attached to and connected with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRoaming the world with curiosity and joy is not &quot;bottom up&quot; learning.   Information prescribed and &quot;taught&quot; so that someone can pass a test isn&#39;t &quot;top down&quot; in any moral or logical way.   The history and mythology of our language and culture has heaven at top (God, angels) and evil at bottom (ignorance, devils, hell).   Anyone planning to work with unschooling families might want to consider approaching them as equals or superiors, and not as inferiors who are randomly and accidentally learning, down below.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be too rough for some practicing, believing Christians, but here are some other ideas about what&#39;s up and what&#39;s down.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/theology\">http://sandradodd.com/theology</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the part that&#39;s not too blasphemous:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just a Christian idea that heaven is &quot;up,&quot; so either heaven IS up, or humans in general have an idea that below the ground isn&#39;t the place to want to be, and that all that light and air and pretty cloud-stuff should be our goal. Is NASA like saints ascending? In any fewer than a dozen ways?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy wouldn&#39;t people think there is fire and brimstone under the ground? THERE IS!!!! Anyone who has been around a sulphur spring or hot springs or volcanic activity knows that under the ground there&#39;s evil, painful, stinky hot stuff not conducive to human comfort. It&#39;s not rocket-theology to figure that one out. But the sky... OOOOh, it&#39;s pretty. It smells good lots of times. Those little breezes on your face are like a mother&#39;s touch (good touch).

I think most learning that young children do<br/>\nand much learning in older kids, teens, and adults is incidental. By<br/>\nincidental I mean that the learning isn&#39;t the point of what they are doing<br/>\n- they are pursuing some activity, solving a specific problem, engaged in a<br/>\nconversation, playing a game, watching a tv show, etc., and they happen to<br/>\nlearn a whole lot of stuff in the process. By intentional I mean that they<br/>\nset out on purpose to learn something - maybe they decide to learn to play<br/>\nguitar and they watch youtube videos to that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidental could be called implicit and intentional learning could be<br/>\nreferred to as explicit -- but the terms aren&#39;t as clear, imo. They have<br/>\nmore to do with what is displayed/seen/observed/expressed than whether it<br/>\nis happening naturally or with a conscious choice to learn something<br/>\nspecific. (Implicit means understood to exist but not openly<br/>\nexpressed/explicit means fully and clearly expressed).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, confusing these concepts (incidental versus intentional) with<br/>\nbottom-up and top-down really muddies things. Implicit and explicit don&#39;t<br/>\nseem to me to have anything to do with bottom-up and top-down learning. I<br/>\nthink maybe Shauna&#39;s point is that some learning happens without another<br/>\nperson giving direct information (a kid working out on their own how to<br/>\nsolve a puzzle, for example) while other learning involves someone giving<br/>\ninstructions (the older child explaining the rules of a game).<br/>\n<br/>\nI get the feeling that this dichotomy might be used to justify the need for<br/>\nteachers, though, as if some things are better taught (top-down) and other<br/>\nthings can be learned in a &quot;bottom-up&quot; way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of how unschooled kids learn as either &quot;bottom up&quot; (on their own)<br/>\nversus top-down (being taught) isn&#39;t a helpful way to better understand<br/>\nunschooling.

That&#39;s a legitimate reason for a family not to want to &quot;support&quot; a &quot;test taking program.&quot;  I can see why someone unfamiliar with unschooling woudln&#39;t have considered that aspect of it, though--of the confidence that can be gained from doing something without instruction and coaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people ask (as one did last week) what it could possibly hurt for someone to teach a child to read.  It can hurt a lot.  If the child doesn&#39;t learn to read during that instructional foray, it hurts confidence and puts a scar on his future reading.  If the child DOES learn to read during those weeks or months, it causes both child and &quot;teacher&quot; to believe that the child wouldn&#39;t have learned to read otherwise.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper\">http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper</a>  is short, and has things from Joyce, me, and Pam Sorooshian.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose ideas can apply to later accomplishments and learning, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope if you are going to be working with unschoolers that you will find ways to understand and respect unschooling, and not think you would be doing unschooling families a favor by introducing explicit learning in any sort of dance of your design.  I would rather (since you asked) that you would not do anything to discourage others from understanding unschooling, by coming to understand it better yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136234893,"authorName":"Shauna Reisewitz","from":"Shauna Reisewitz &lt;shaunareisewitz@...&gt;","profile":"shaunareisewitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: on starting a transcript documentation service-school","postDate":"1345809663","msgId":68762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDU4MDk2NjMuMjQzNjkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMTUwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":""},"prevInTopic":68750,"nextInTopic":68763,"prevInTime":68761,"nextInTime":68763,"topicId":68748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, Thanks for letting this through, I ve been corresponding a little bit with Pam off the list since sending it, so didn t expect to see my post here.  ...

Or maybe so! Has Wes Beach&#39;s school given diplomas to people outside the U.S.?----<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if Wes has had a student out of the US. I&#39;m wondering and will ask<br/>\nhim -- or wondering if anyone knows the answer- if a high school diploma from a<br/>\nprivate school in the US means anything official in any other country. <br/>\nIf you are 14 or  16 years old in France or Brazil or South Africa and get a high school diploma  through<br/>\nworking on line with someone in California, I can&#39;t imagine it carrying much<br/>\nweight- but maybe it does. I don&#39;t know the answer to that does anyone? Like everything,  it probably depends on the  situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyways I was mulling over the thought  of implicit vs explicit<br/>\nlearning. Clearly we can all agree that the system is ridiculously out of<br/>\nbalance and focuses almost completely on leaning explicitly. Though ironically<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that all educators in the system would agree that &quot;the best kind<br/>\nof learning&quot; happens when kids are implicitly interested in the material-<br/>\nand they are interested and engaged- so the best of them do a lot of song and dance and try to get kids interests piqued. And there are the few charter type schools that offer various classes- that kids can choose to take if they are interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut is there a dance between top down(explict to implict) and bottom up(implicit to<br/>\nexplict) learning? I&#39;m thinking that perhaps there is.. When a<br/>\nchild wants to learn a game for instance, and learns by playing (implicit), but<br/>\nthen an older child teaches the younger one something new about the game- the<br/>\nnext level- that would be explicit- no? It only works however when the implict<br/>\ndrive is there in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen some parents rely almost completely on implicit learning, and their<br/>\nkids have missed out on opportunities-- for example- a kid interested in<br/>\ntheater, but the parents never getting it together to enroll him for whatever<br/>\nreason-- some of what that child may  have learned in the theater group<br/>\nwould be taught from a explicit to implicit way. And of course there may have<br/>\nbeen a lot of implicit learning going on as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just throwing out an idea here- I haven&#39;t applied top down - bottom up<br/>\nconcepts to education before very recently- though of course I have thought of<br/>\nthese ideas in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n------Can you give an example of &quot;explicit learning&quot; that your school would.... recognize/recommend /teach? <br/>\nAny examples I&#39;m thinking of tend to be things that would compromise natural learning. Maybe I&#39;m not picturing what you&#39;re picturing.----<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my school goes- it would depend on the families. If I was working<br/>\nwith a strong unschooling family who just wanted help documenting their<br/>\ntranscripts-- I wouldn&#39;t give any  recommendations or teachings unless asked for- I would<br/>\nask questions about what the teen was doing for record keeping recognization sake, and write<br/>\nup a transcript according to what she did -- also helping her reach her goals ( a particular college&#39;s requirements for example). In the past I have turned hours of video gaming into classes I call &quot;logic<br/>\nand strategy&quot; or a girl I know who helped her dad build an extra room in<br/>\nher house- I called that &quot;architectural design&quot;, &quot;construction technology&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;woodworking.&quot; An avid John Stewart fan- I called what he did<br/>\n&quot;Political Science&quot; --stuff like that. If the teen needed grades, I<br/>\nwould ask her to self evaluate, and make some estimate of credits based on the<br/>\nnumbers of hours the teen put into it, how important it was to the teen and how<br/>\nmuch the teen felt she learned from the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess if I saw a family who was claiming to unschool and found our from the teen that he really really wanted to pass a particular test (i just had a  case going on like this), but the parents were so anti- school that they were completely unsupportive, I&#39;d look for a test taking program  and encourage the parents to help support the teen in this endeavor. (This is the short description of what I&#39;d do.) This may be an example of something that implicitly desired- but then explicitly supported. That class or program may be taught in an explicit to implicit way- but the desire to put oneself in it came from the implicit drive to prove to herself that she could pass a particular test. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a different kind of teen, who was stuck in the school system and<br/>\nwanted out, I would spend time helping him figure out his learning styles and<br/>\nintelligences. And find out where his passions were. And spend time helping his<br/>\nparents see that he wasn&#39;t a failure, etc, etc. Encourage him to set a goal,<br/>\nany goal and find a way to complete it. Evaluate with him when he was ready to<br/>\nmove on.  If he came to me read to move on, I&#39;d ask him to complete a portfolio project (see web site-www.pacificsandsacademy.com) and give him the opportunity to move on. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery thing I&#39;d do here is more complicated that what I&#39;ve described- but these are the lines of my thinking. I&#39;m open to constructive criticism here.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShauna<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] on starting a transcript documentation service-school","postDate":"1345761228","msgId":68750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVENDMxMzQzLTM5NkEtNDMzNy04M0YxLTkxMkJBMzVBRDBBQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDU3NTQzNTAuNTk3MTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMTUwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzNDU3NTQzNTAuNTk3MTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMTUwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68748,"nextInTopic":68762,"prevInTime":68749,"nextInTime":68751,"topicId":68748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I let this through even though it doesn t apply to people who are outside the U.S., probably.

This then gives kids under 18 a way to pursue anything that a kid with a high school diploma can. -- entrance into Community College, entrance into various vocational schools, something to put on a resume, etc... The spin I&#39;m adding is to provide a transcript tracking service to unschoolers - to work with me through all or part of high school, or at the end,  to develop a transcript.  Now we all know that no one NEEDS this service, but some people may find it useful, so they can go on enjoying unschooling with their family, and get a little help with documenting their kids activities for transcript purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve come up with some feedback from a friend who is an ecologist and has worked starting many nonprofits,  that my web site seems too negative and focuses on   everything I don&#39;t do rather than what I do do. Which has gotten me trying to phrase it in a  more positive way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich has gotten me thinking about top down and bottom up systems. (I also have an ecological background) so this has one meaning to ecologists, and a sort of corallary-ish meaning to educators. In education- top down (explicit going to implicit knowledge) is our basic model of education. teachers- teaching- the state having standards and requirements- that sort of explicitly taught to the children. While unschooling focuses more on bottom up knowledge acquisition- Children learn implicitly from their experiences. Then- where my mind wandered was to some combination of the two- when the implict drive to learn something new may lead  to  the seeking  out of explicit learning experiences.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of implicit vs explicit learning? top down vs bottom up? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m offering is sort of a &quot;top down&quot; reward to kids who gain their readiness to move on in a &quot;bottom-up&quot; way. Their learning happens first- I document and write a transcript for it. This gives our kids who have had a wonderfully rich education all the benefits of a high school diploma. Again, something parents can provide  themselves if they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think there would be an interest in this in the unschooling world? I&#39;m also trying to reach kids who are in the system, and give them a  way to earn a high school diploma quickly without jumping through state mandated hoops. This is my main target market, really. But I have experience working in this way with homeschoolers and unschoolers, so am adding the transcript creation  twist. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone would like to check out my web site- I would very very much appreciate feedback. I&#39;m looking for feedback from unschoolers to  people in the &quot;normal world&quot;- who are just looking for an alternative to high school to help their kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nwww.pacificsandsacademy.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any one would like to talk to me about any of these ideas, I will be at the widesky conference in San Diego.<br/>\nI&#39;m really excited about this venture actually. I&#39;m learning so much  about starting a business-creating a web page- and may favorite part is really deeply thinking about these services can really help kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68602,"nextTopicId":68848}}
