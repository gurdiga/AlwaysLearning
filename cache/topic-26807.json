These are cartoons about cartoons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI added those last two sentences this morning to the page on art<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/arts\">http://sandradodd.com/arts</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after I wrote it I realized that last night when Holly and I got  <br/>\nback from having seen Lady in the Water, I told Kirby and Marty &quot;It&#39;s  <br/>\na fairy tale about fairy tales. It&#39;s a movie about movies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that idea was still in my head when I wrote &quot;This is art  <br/>\nabout art.  These are cartoons about cartoons.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are probably lots of other such things, like paintings about  <br/>\npaintings (There&#39;s a Norman Rockwell of him doing a self-portrait,  <br/>\nlooking in a mirror. I should put that in my mirror art collection,  <br/>\nnow that I think of it.) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/mirrrors\">http://sandradodd.com/mirrrors</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are songs about songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of a few plays about plays, but I know them as movies of  <br/>\nplays about plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a fun idea and I just love fun ideas that can turn into years- <br/>\nlong scavenger hunts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26798,"nextTopicId":26585}}
