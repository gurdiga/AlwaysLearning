I&#39;ll put that link below, but  <br/>\nsomeone found it who has created a 21st century version tying back to  <br/>\nancient myths and illustrating the fundamentals of commerce and  <br/>\nmanagement.  He wants to know if I could include it on my page.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI said yes, please!  I hope to have an image and some links t  <br/>\narticles.  I&#39;m going to put the letter up with links to the stories  <br/>\nand characters from Hindu mythology, too, if I can find good pages.   <br/>\nThis is very, very exciting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\ndear sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am Dr K.P.Sastry  educator in Karimnagar found a novel way to  <br/>\nunite love of board games.I created a new version of the popular game  <br/>\nSnakes and Ladders (VYKUNTAPALI) that teaches the fundementals of  <br/>\ncommerce and management.I am working as reader in commerce at SRR  <br/>\ngovernment degree and PG college. I used snakes to represent upward  <br/>\ntrends and ladders to show downward trends in commerce.For example,  <br/>\npopulation explosion is represented by a snake and brings players to  <br/>\npoverty,whereas advertising,which leads to higher sales,is  <br/>\nrepresented by a ladder.In this innovation chart, the basic concepts  <br/>\nof 10 subjects,including accountancy,industrial organisation and  <br/>\nmanagement,marketing,stock exchange speculation and banking are  <br/>\nillustrated using natural and mythological referencas,ranging from  <br/>\nfarms and animals to the stories of  ARTHNAREESWARA TATWAM and   <br/>\nKSHEERASAGAR MATHANAM.for instance,NARADA (the one who monitors  <br/>\ninformation among the three worlds or lokas) int the chart  <br/>\nillustrates the importance of effective communication management.This  <br/>\ngame is basically a low cost teaching aid.My idea was to present the  <br/>\nfundamentals of commerce pictorially in the form of a game.I worked  <br/>\non the idea by revising and improving on the original Snakes and  <br/>\nLadders game and symbolically incorporating concepts of commerce. The  <br/>\nchart was appreciated by several newspapers and  UGC ETC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very happy to  know that you are also very much interested in  <br/>\nsnakes and ladders games of the above type;   Now I request you to<br/>\ninform me about the possibility of incorporating my chart also in  <br/>\nyour website.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  yours Friendly<br/>\n<br/>\nDr .K.P.Sastry<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy page is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/game/snakesandladders\">http://sandradodd.com/game/snakesandladders</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29507,"nextTopicId":29437}}
