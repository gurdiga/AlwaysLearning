The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2055367337\">I have been reading a great book by the Dalai Lama called &quot;The Art of <br/>\nHappiness, A Handbook for Living&quot;. So much of it reminds me of what we <br/>\ndiscuss here. The central idea is that the very purpose of our lives is to <br/>\nseek happiness. Not happiness in a hedonistic sense, but in an ultimate <br/>\ncontentment, life worth living sense. Even though he&#39;s obviously a devout <br/>\nBuddhist, he removes religion from all discussions and just talks about <br/>\nhumankind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as I was reading along, I found myself agreeing with everything he <br/>\nwas saying. That is until I got to this paragraph:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...And knowledge does not come by naturally. We have to train; we have to <br/>\ngo through a kind of systematic training program and so forth. And we <br/>\nconsider this conventional education and training to be quite hard; <br/>\notherwise why would students look forward to vacations so much. Still we <br/>\nknow that this kind of education is quite vital for ensuring a happy and <br/>\nsuccessful life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was using this as a demonstration of why we need to train ourselves <br/>\ntowards using positive emotions in our lives. I don&#39;t disagree with that, <br/>\nbut as an unschooler I have obvious problems with the idea that learning <br/>\nmust be structured, systematic and difficult. And that knowledge can not <br/>\ncome naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I was thinking, maybe I should write a letter and share with him some of <br/>\nthe ideas currently floating around the west about children and education <br/>\nand all. I mean, think of how cool it would be to start a letter to His <br/>\nHoliness the Dalai Lama with &quot;Allow me to enlighten you...&quot; :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how would you address such a letter? Why &quot;Hello Dalai&quot;, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich further got me thinking that if the refugee Tibetans are ever allowed <br/>\nback into Tibet, the only appropriate song to sing would be the first verse <br/>\nof &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hello Dalai, well hello Dalai, it&#39;s so nice to have you back where you <br/>\nbelong...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary, who has now revealed what she has been doing while trying to figure <br/>\nout how she&#39;ll ever read the 250  new messages in her inbox.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4085,"nextTopicId":3625}}
