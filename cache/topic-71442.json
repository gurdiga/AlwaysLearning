As much as possible, no more interrupting what she&#39;s doing, or asking her to lie down. And since she likes yoga, I ask her to do downward dog and she happily does allowing me to clean her.<br/>\n- I bring clothes with us and dress her either on the front porch, if it&#39;s too cold to make it to the car, or when we get there, or not at all if we&#39;re going someplace it&#39;s not inappropriate for her to just be in a diaper. And, I&#39;ve started letting go of my discomfort with the disapproving looks, tut tuts, and comments from strangers. My daughter&#39;s happiness is what matters, not their opinion.<br/>\n- I&#39;ve minimized the outings we go on. Turns out she really does like to be home, and is in a phase where she doesn&#39;t need to go somewhere everyday. (I say phase only because she used to seem to need to get out of the house everyday to be happy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading Playful Parenting, too, which is also helping a lot. Thanks to those who suggested it on this and previous threads. It&#39;s a very helpful book I can imagine reading several times throughout my daughter&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also keep trying to remember that she will continue to change and what works today may not work tomorrow. This helps me a bit in letting go of my attachment to things going smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m doing my best to try and get a little better at this everyday. Thanks again for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, sarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71413,"nextTopicId":71443}}
