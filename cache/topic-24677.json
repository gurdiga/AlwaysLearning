The boys and I are in a new 4-H club, our county moved an<br/>\nhistoric barn to the county fairgrounds. It&#39;s 130 years old and absolutely<br/>\nbeautiful. The club is going to plant heirloom gardens around it. We&#39;ve had<br/>\nfun looking up heirloom plants for our area. Karl wants to do herbs, Ben<br/>\nwants to find out vegetables. I prefer the flowers. Once we find a few of<br/>\neach, we&#39;ll be getting some seeds and tyring to start them inside....just<br/>\nlike they did 130 years ago. Except that I know a lot of trading of cuttings<br/>\nand roots took place for many of the plants....so we&#39;re having fun not just<br/>\nlearning about the plants, but how did they propagate and how did people<br/>\nacquire the plants for their gardens. I&#39;m looking longingly at my little<br/>\nplots of land and waiting for spring.....but in the meantime, I&#39;ll grab my<br/>\nhot coffee and look at sunny plots of land on-line....and enjoy Sandra&#39;s<br/>\nflower!<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-17, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/2/06, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could go there to see it with the flower, but here&#39;s the text of<br/>\n&gt; something written today:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, it&#39;s the first flower in MY yard.

So along with several wan quotes<br/>\n&gt; from the unschoolers she interviewed, she had two more solid (but<br/>\n&gt; easily refutable) quotes from a school psychologist and a Harvard<br/>\n&gt; admissions person.

If I&#39;d had a fancier camera,<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d&#39;ve used photos of Holly instead of a stranger lying in a field<br/>\n&gt; of flowers. But their magazine is about appearances, and unschooling<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t much about appearances at all. Probably it just wasn&#39;t a very<br/>\n&gt; good match. Those interested in wearing those clothes and that makeup<br/>\n&gt; probably need to &quot;stay on track&quot; so they can get jobs writing fluffy<br/>\n&gt; articles for New York fashion magazines.
