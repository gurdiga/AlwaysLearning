How about for your other two? We&#39;ve found that<br/>\nprevention of irritants and prethinking what triggers our guy with special<br/>\nissues helps us to put together a more gratifying trip for everyone. For<br/>\nthat matter, thinking about each person individually in the family and what<br/>\nthey like and don&#39;t like is very helpful in planning a great trip. It may<br/>\nnot look anything at all like it would have if the parents just proceeded<br/>\nwithout everyone&#39;s inclusion of ideas, desires and input.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just went on a road trip recently and things were MUCH different than<br/>\nthey would have been if I planned the trip on my own. For instance, we took<br/>\ntwo vehicles...a mini-van with a TV and dvd player and dh&#39;s 4 door sedan<br/>\nwith a good sound system. There were 7 of us on the trip, and the mini-van<br/>\nfit 8 plus storage, so we could have done that. But two of the kids had the<br/>\nidea that it would potentially be hell at times with all our different<br/>\npersonalities and needs trying to come to consensus on  whether to watch TV<br/>\nor sing or listen to music, etc. Two of our family members are kind of &quot;high<br/>\nneed&quot;, maybe similar to your son. What a world of difference it made to have<br/>\na choice of two places to ride. And the extra space. And the many different<br/>\nvariations of different people together. I would have just planned on the<br/>\none van, gas prices and all, and that was indeed part of the picture. But we<br/>\nweighed it all out and dh and I figured out a way to do it. And it was a<br/>\ngreat trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably not feasible for what you guys are doing, but I just bring<br/>\nit up as an example of how flexibility, including everyone&#39;s ideas, and<br/>\nreally thinking about each person going and their needs, can really make it<br/>\na great trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also agreed to stop when ANYONE asked. This alleviated stress<br/>\nimmediately...dh and I didn&#39;t realize that, because of previous trips,<br/>\npeople now hesitated to ask to stop for the bathroom or whatever because of<br/>\nadult or sibling reaction because we had stopped not too long before. Doh!<br/>\nThere was a visible relaxation when we were talking about this as people<br/>\nwere listened to. And it worked well! No one batted an eyelash when someone<br/>\nasked to stop no matter how recently we had already stopped. And it didn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen too often either. Happiness in the vehicle is a pretty dang awesome<br/>\ngift on a road trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my point is that in unschooling, even doing something that seems so<br/>\nwonderful and adventurous as hitting the road still needs thoughtful<br/>\nplanning and inclusion of everyone&#39;s ideas in the process. And parents<br/>\ntaking the time to think about what some pitfalls may be from knowing their<br/>\nchildren, and working to avoid them, is very helpful as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;and we&#39;re eagerly anticipating the many educational<br/>\n&gt;&gt;experiences to come while on the road...&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would suggest subtracting the word &quot;educational&quot; from the sentence above,<br/>\nand see how it feels. Unschooling has little to do with looking at separate<br/>\nlife experiences as educational, but more enjoying a basking in the<br/>\nexperiences as they come, if they are of interest. Enjoying life and living<br/>\nfully usually leads to whatever you need to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have just recently heard of un schooling and the idea intrigue&#39;s me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I would love to hear more on the subject.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>www.sandradodd.com<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has graciously and meticulously gathered so much information on her<br/>\nsight about unschooling (and other really neat tidbits!) that most questions<br/>\ncan be answered there, and lots of information can be gained.
