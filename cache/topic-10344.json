In your mind, being a parent is<br/>\nbeing controlling about food. How wonderful that you&#39;re seeing that for what<br/>\nit is (a problem with the parent, not the child) and you&#39;re changing it for<br/>\nthis generation!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents were controlling too (but not as grandparents, leaving my son to<br/>\nask once if we were talking about the same people!) and I&#39;ve had to become<br/>\nvery aware of my &quot;instincts&quot; so that I don&#39;t just repeat their mistakes. I<br/>\nremember as a young adult watching how other families parented, just soaking<br/>\nit up, so that I could see that there were other ways to go about it without<br/>\nrestricting everything. Respecting one&#39;s child was a revelation to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10343,"nextTopicId":10346}}
