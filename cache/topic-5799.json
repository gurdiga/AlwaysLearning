You have made<br/>\nmassive changes in your life and in the lives of your children in just a few<br/>\nmonths.  Change is tiring for all concerned.  May I suggest giving yourself<br/>\nsome breathing room?  Just relax and breathe.  Spend some days watching the<br/>\ngrass grow and the clouds float by.  Let yourself and your kids just &quot;be&quot;<br/>\nfor awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need time to incorporate all the changes you&#39;ve made.  It&#39;s like when dh<br/>\ncan no longer stand the lack of organization in the pantry and puts all the<br/>\nsnack food on one shelf and all the cereal on another.  Even though it is<br/>\neasier to find things eventually, initially it is slightly unnerving because<br/>\nthings aren&#39;t where they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be.  (I use the jars of horrible<br/>\npickles I made last summer that are still taking up space as a landmark to<br/>\nfind where I put things.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who took over a year to complete the initial deschooling phase and<br/>\nwho needs regular boosters of joy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5793,"nextTopicId":5759}}
