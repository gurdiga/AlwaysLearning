The behavior came before the terminology. It is <br/>\na description of a lifestyle in which we ALL offer interesting things to <br/>\neach other throughout the days, weeks, months, years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people seem to be thinking of it as an instructional method - <br/>\na sneaky sort of teaching technique. It is just a description of the <br/>\n&quot;Lifestyle of the Interested and Interesting.&quot; (I nominate that for the <br/>\ntitle of a new reality show.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  It isn&#39;t only unschooling families who do this, either. My sister is a <br/>\nstrewer extraordinaire and her kids went to school up until almost the <br/>\nend of high school. But she and her husband were simply very very <br/>\ninteresting parents whose focus was on enjoying life with their kids - <br/>\nso &quot;strewing&quot; was natural to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My grandparents were strewers in a big way - even when I was growing <br/>\nup and they lived overseas in various interesting countries (Libya, <br/>\nIran, Turkey), they would send us packets of stuff - just things they&#39;d <br/>\npick up that they thought were cool. Back then I thought of my <br/>\ngrandparents and parents as having &quot;collections.&quot; Collecting was a big <br/>\nthing in my childhood - everybody in the 50&#39;s was into stamp collecting <br/>\nor matchbook collecting or coin collecting or something. My parents and <br/>\ngrandparents collected interesting stuff and people and experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat rubbed off on my sisters and on me and just naturally seems to lead <br/>\nto what unschoolers are now calling &quot;strewing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parents are offering cool and interesting ideas to the kids and <br/>\nto each other, because it is a fun way to live life, why would the <br/>\nchildren not also start to do that - naturally?  Naming it doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nit happen any more than naming &quot;eating&quot; makes people choose to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents who don&#39;t live this way naturally can benefit from hearing about <br/>\nhow it is possible and how fun it is, etc., and to talk about it we use <br/>\nthe name, strewing, but, really, it is a description of a natural way to <br/>\nlive, not something parents use on their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think my kids heard the word, strewing until they were in their <br/>\nlate teens. At that point, their reaction was just sort of mild interest <br/>\nthat doing that kind of thing would have its own name.  To them, it was <br/>\njust family life. They couldn&#39;t (maybe still can&#39;t, really) imagine very <br/>\nwell how a family could live any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;  I was wondering if the children are aware of the strewing idea.  While<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  reading your list I was thinking that some of the things may have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  brought in by the children.  I have been keeping this idea to myself.
