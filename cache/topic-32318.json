Lots of laughs, lots of animals. I would do #1 and/or #4 (All<br/>\n&gt;  Creatures or The Lord God Made..) since the middle two might be more<br/>\n&gt;  interesting to an older child or adult. Many of the chapters will<br/>\n&gt;  function<br/>\n&gt;  as &quot;stand-alone&quot; stories so don&#39;t be frightened by the length.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  The Great Brain series (J.D. Fitzgerald, with Mercer Mayer illustrations)<br/>\n&gt;  is, in my opinion, perfect read-aloud for a 10 year old boy with the<br/>\n&gt;  added<br/>\n&gt;  advantage that *you* could enjoy them too. Some pathos and drama but<br/>\n&gt;  little that is &quot;scary&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  If he likes historical or past settings that have young boys as a main<br/>\n&gt;  character, then you might try Johnny Tremaine, Rifles for Watie, or<br/>\n&gt;  Across<br/>\n&gt;  Five Aprils. That last one is by Irene Hunt who has several &quot;juvenile&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  books that do *not* follow the idea that books for children need to be<br/>\n&gt;  silly<br/>\n&gt;  and watered down. My favorite by Hunt is probably No Promises in the<br/>\n&gt;  Wind.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Black Stallion series was a good recommendation. Pretty formulaic but<br/>\n&gt;  plenty of horses and plenty of adventure.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Any of the Ben K. Greene books or the Ralph Moody Little Britches series<br/>\n&gt;  lend themselves to segmented reading. They have a long common thread but<br/>\n&gt;  can be read like a collection of short stories.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I think it nice when &quot;read-aloud&quot; books are interesting for the person<br/>\n&gt;  reading as well as for the audience :-)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  vicki<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  On Sun, Feb 24, 2008 at 11:13 AM, tracyliebmann &lt;[LINK:<br/>\n&gt;  mailto:tracyliebmann%40hotmail.com] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracyliebmann@...\">tracyliebmann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Hi~ My DS is wanting me to read books aloud to him...but needs<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; suggestions...thought you all would have some titles you could pass<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; along.

By the way, I&#39;m Susan <br/>\nand my husband, son, and I live in Tennessee.  We&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>\nsince my son was five.  That&#39;s when I discovered John Holt, John <br/>\nTaylor Gatto, Grace Llewellyn, found Sandra&#39;s website, and read The <br/>\nUnschooling Handbook.  There&#39;s a huge homeschooling community in our <br/>\nsmall town, but we are the only unschoolers I personally know. That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy I love this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 9, he also doesn&#39;t like Harry Potter but loves <br/>\nanimals/wilderness books.  He&#39;s an avid reader, mostly poultry <br/>\nmagazines and catalogs and anything non-fiction, but we always have <br/>\na &quot;chapter&quot; book going that I read to him.  Right now we&#39;re reading <br/>\nJulie of the Wolves and The Far Side of the Mountain (the sequel to <br/>\nMy Side of the Mountain - also a great movie) both by Jean Craighead <br/>\nGeorge.  I love these books because of their unschooling flavor: kids <br/>\ngoing out on their own, pursuing their interests, and learning <br/>\nthrough real-world experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also love anything by Kate DiCamillo.  Besides Because of Winn-<br/>\nDixie, she has written some other great books like Tiger Rising, The <br/>\nTale of Despereaux (no ninjas but it&#39;s set in a castle) and The <br/>\nAdventures of Edward Tulane.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son really enjoyed two books by Meindert Dejong.  Along Came a Dog <br/>\nsparked an interest in chickens which led to his own flock and full <br/>\nscale egg business which is doing great.  The book Shadrach got my <br/>\nson interested in rabbits - we now have 10 at our house!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these suggestions help!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"&quot;Vicki Dennis&quot; &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Books Your Sons Have Enjoyed??","postDate":"1203897742","msgId":32345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5Y2ExYmJhMDgwMjI0MTYwMncyNWY2MDU4ZnI5ODQwZjg3MjE3YTkwMTZhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwczhrOCt1aXVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwczhrOCt1aXVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32341,"nextInTopic":32346,"prevInTime":32344,"nextInTime":32346,"topicId":32318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Try Hank the Cowdog....if he likes the format then there will be 25 more to choose from!

Lots of laughs, lots of animals.   I would do #1 and/or #4 (All<br/>\nCreatures or The Lord God Made..) since the middle two might be more<br/>\ninteresting to an older child or adult.  Many of the chapters will function<br/>\nas &quot;stand-alone&quot;  stories so don&#39;t be frightened by the length.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Great Brain series (J.D. Fitzgerald, with Mercer Mayer illustrations)<br/>\nis, in my opinion, perfect read-aloud for a 10 year old boy with the added<br/>\nadvantage that *you* could enjoy them too.  Some pathos and drama  but<br/>\nlittle that is &quot;scary&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he likes historical or past settings that have young boys as a main<br/>\ncharacter, then you might try Johnny Tremaine, Rifles for Watie, or Across<br/>\nFive Aprils.  That last one is by Irene Hunt who has several &quot;juvenile&quot;<br/>\nbooks that do *not* follow the idea that books for children need to be silly<br/>\nand watered down.    My favorite by Hunt is probably No Promises in the<br/>\nWind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlack Stallion series was a good recommendation.  Pretty formulaic but<br/>\nplenty of horses and plenty of adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of the Ben K. Greene books or the Ralph Moody Little Britches series<br/>\nlend themselves to segmented reading.  They have a long common thread but<br/>\ncan be read like a collection of short stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it nice when &quot;read-aloud&quot;  books are interesting for the person<br/>\nreading as well as for the audience :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Feb 24, 2008 at 11:13 AM, tracyliebmann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracyliebmann@...\">tracyliebmann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Hi~ My DS is wanting me to read books aloud to him...but needs<br/>\n&gt; suggestions...thought you all would have some titles you could pass<br/>\n&gt; along.
