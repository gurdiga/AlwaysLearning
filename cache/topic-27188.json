I found it because I put in a CD I own and told iTunes  <br/>\nnot to import it, but when iTunes came up it showed classical albums,  <br/>\ndown along the bottom.  I clicked on this one to see what it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s 34 songs, with a booklet, for $9.99 and I&#39;m getting it.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot only Halloween soundtrack, it has recognizably familiar things  <br/>\nthat will bring back all kinds of memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend using it to go to sleep at night, or for calming  <br/>\npeaceful music when someone&#39;s depressed.  But for occasional special  <br/>\nuse or a Halloween party, it seems perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost songs can be bought individually, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s most cool is that its release date is October 17, 2006.  It&#39;s  <br/>\njust new today!  Had I not woken up at 3:30 I couldn&#39;t have told you  <br/>\nabout it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s one listed on Amazon by the same name, but it only has twelve  <br/>\npieces, the cover is different and the reviews aren&#39;t great.  This  <br/>\nhas almost three times as much music for the same price, but I can&#39;t  <br/>\nsend a link because iTunes isn&#39;t like that.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27185,"nextTopicId":27183}}
