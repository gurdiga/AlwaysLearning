He took our girls to Point Dume -- a beautiful cove beach at low tide.  They saw seastars in the rocky tidepools and noticed how the sun sets in a different spot in the wintertime.  We usually only go to Pt. Dume in the summer.  The girls played gleefully and fell asleep easily after a full day of going to one o their favorite places.

I don&#39;t mean that *you* need to adopt the same parenting strategies as your dh, but to focus on your own relationships and with supporting the people you love in who they are. You dh, like most parents new to home-ed, is likely floundering along, trying to figure out what he really thinks. It doesn&#39;t help him to have you dissing his parenting - even gently and behind his back. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were still new to unschooling, it helped George and my relationship with George to focus on what I loved about him, what I saw as wonderful about him as a person. A lot of that had to do with the way he is as a parent - but I couldn&#39;t see that when I was focusing on where he was falling short of my expectations. When I could see George as a loving father, trying to be patient and thoughtful and kind and unsure if he was &quot;getting it right&quot; it was easier for me to appreciate him and love him and thus support him in his own goals for his relationship with the kids. That let him be softer with the kids - a whole lot of his hardness came from uncertainty and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was true of a lot of men. They&#39;re raised to bludgeon their way past uncertainty so they can be Men. It helped George a lot for him to know he could be soft and even vulnerable and unsure around me, that I wouldn&#39;t think less of him, that I adored every bit of softness he had to offer - but for him to trust that, *I* had to be soft, even when I was as sure as I could be. He needed me to be gentle and supportive while he figured out how to be a different kind of dad - and man - than what he was raised to. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ah-ha!

At 4.5, kids are exiting the toddler years and are becoming more independent and are expressing themselves much more forcefully. I seem to recall 4.5 being around the age where my girls were finally tall enough and strong enough to do a lot more for themselves. Their verbal skills also exploded, which led to them having a lot more to say. Is this a problem with your husband being firm or is it the fact that your daughter is trying to assert some of her new found independence? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My theory is that DD has been tasting more choice and freedom from me and when DH doesn&#39;t give her the same choice and freedom, she gets mad at him. DH has always been more firm with DD than me and also much more an enforcer of rules and pre-determined consequences to things (the kids walk away from food, DH puts food away).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does your husband think? Have you talked to him about this? What does she do while you are at work? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I definitely think I could help reduce the tension between DD and DH, but it requires being there more! And, that requires quitting my job.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do they manage while you are gone? Are your children happy and healthy for the most part? Have you considered that the tension is a result of you and your attitude? I am with my girls all day, every day and sometimes there is tension when my husband is home because we get into a rhythm and my husband coming home changes the dynamic. He does things differently than I do (not better or worse, different). You have said that you work 12 hour days. How much time do you actually get to spend with your children each day? One way that you could help reduce the tension is to give your husband the evenings off so that most of your daughter&#39;s interactions are with you. Sometimes there is tension because my girls want my husband&#39;s attention but don&#39;t always know how to get it. If picking a fight with your husband get&#39;s your attention, then try to give your daughter attention before she gets a chance to pick a fight. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your husband get to go out? Maybe you can encourage him to go out or do stuff for himself so that you can have  more one on one time with the kids. Being a stay at home parent can take a toll on a person, especially with two children as young as yours. Any time one parent wants to do something different from another, it can be stressful. Kids can sense the lack of unity and it can cause a lot of confusion and tension. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I feel like if DH were more unschooly, then i could relax and just work while he unschools the kids. Until DH truly gets it, I have felt that I would unschool &quot;better&quot;. I do recognize that&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Think about this from your husband&#39;s perspective. You have more earning potential and provide the financial support. Now, you have found a way to raise your children that you feel is superior to his ways. It sounds like you think you can do everything better than your spouse. That must be really emasculating for him. Why does he have to be more unschooly? Nobody has to unschool. Why isn&#39;t it enough for you to unschool your interactions with him and your children? How does your husband feel about no limits on TV and food? What kind of input have you sought from him? He has said that he wants to continue with the school applications but you have shot him down. Have you looked at the age for compulsory attendance in your state? In many states, kindergarten isn&#39;t mandatory. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you the number of times that I have read posts from a stay at home parent that says that it should be her/his decision because she/he is the one that is with the children all the time. How would you feel if your husband said this to you? <br/>\n<br/>\nSome other things to consider are whether or not your husband wants to work. If he wants to work and you want to be home, then it might be time for the two of you to sit down and talk about how to make things work so that both of you are doing what you really want to do. Earning potential isn&#39;t as important as everybody being happy. If you and your husband and your children aren&#39;t happy with the current arrangement, then try to find ways to change things so that everybody will be happy. You mentioned a grand year of travel for kindergarten. Why can&#39;t you save that money so that you can be with your children at home? Do all of the jobs in your field require you to work such long hours? My husband wanted more time with the family so he spent several years looking for a job that would pay the bills and allow him to be home a lot. He doesn&#39;t have to work nights or weekends and his work week is 39 hours plus he gets a lot of vacation time. He took a pay cut but we found ways to make it work. As I read your post, I wondered why you have a partner because it sounds like you are the one calling all of the shots, which is not very unschooly. : -)<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ah-ha!

She was 2.5, I was pregnant, was told to lie down as much as possible, to walk as little as possible, so i hardly took her out.  We were there for fall and freezing winter, DH was working ALL the time -- we hardly spent time with him.  I also had to painfully wean her unexpectedly which was heartwrenching.  But DD and I did everything together.  We baked and played in toystores and wandered around a freezing outdoor nighttime Winter Wonderland fair, swam (DH&#39;s boss had a heated indoor pool!) and painted A LOT.  I remember taking her to a library storytime for kids where one of the reading adults tried to make DD play an instrument that went with the story.  Neither DD nor I liked that.  I don&#39;t know how much of a &quot;cultural&quot; experience it was for DD, or even how much of it she&#39;ll remember, but I wonder if we went to New Zealand or Australia and enjoyed each other&#39;s company while exploring a bit, if we could (adults and children) both get a wonderful experience out of it.===<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat jumped out at me in that was: &quot;DD and I did everything together.&quot; Perhaps *that* is why your daughter talks about it like it was the best time of her life! Not because you were away from home, but because *you*, because of circumstances (no friends or family there, hubby working all the time, you needing to take it easy because of your pregnancy), were able to focus so intently on her and spend so much time solely with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===I wonder if we went to New Zealand or Australia and enjoyed each other&#39;s company while exploring a bit, if we could (adults and children) both get a wonderful experience out of it=== [snip] ===I do know that my girls get homesick, though.

For us, though, traveling is less desirable for our daughter the older she gets because she has become more entrenched with her social ties at home.  We traveled a lot (international and domestic), for extended periods of time, throughout her life and until this past summer, she loved it, although doesn&#39;t remember that much about the places we only went to once.  This summer, though, when a three month working-vacation turned into 5 months, it became unpleasant for her.  When 5 months could have become 7 months, we said &quot;no thanks,&quot; and came home.  Not because we were done, but because *she* was. She missed her family and her friends, her dog and cats. She didn&#39;t want to leave home for weeks after our return!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is still game to travel, just not for extended periods of time. If you&#39;re not traveling for dire financial reasons (as in you can&#39;t find work any place else), but for enjoyment, I&#39;d take your daughter&#39;s expressed desires to heart.  I think we could have seriously damaged our daughter&#39;s trust in us to help her get what she wants and needs had we stayed away any longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it has definitely been preferable to travel to one place and stay put for some time, so that place becomes like &quot;home.&quot; A lot of our travels have been to visit relatives overseas, and these are the trips she loves and remembers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraveling also seems like it could be a gentle segue into unschooling for someone who is hesitant because strange/new experiences can heighten the awareness that living *is* learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for school--can she visit a more traditional classroom for a day?

And discussing affording $17.8K/yr-$25K/yr. for something that isn&#39;t even close to what we&#39;d seek for educating our children is definitely helping DH to really consider Unschooling as a practical option, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The best way for him to see other families is to go to conferences.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the best resource for getting info on conferences?<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe get Rue Kream&#39;s book, about parenting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********<br/>\nOrdered it.

Any kindergarten I know of near us is nothing like this.  It will be a rude awakening to see what &quot;real&quot; school is in kindergarten.  And I only know of one school (a multiple-age classroom constuctivist charter that will open next fall) that allows attendance only 2 days a week.  It&#39;s a hybrid 2-2.5 day school that allows 2.5-3 days offsite for families that homeschool.  But this is not about Unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it better to let her try out &quot;school&quot; and give her the option to unschool?  Private schools ask for a contract for the year with nonrefundable deposits.  I suppose I could sign her up for public so that the financial impact, if she quit school, would be less.  But if I want to support her desire for school, should I pick the one that she&#39;s most likely to enjoy, even if it has a huge price tag?  I do see your point, though -- no one knows what DD wants school-wise unless she&#39;s given the choice to begin with!<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-6) If DH gets on the unschool bus sooner than later, I&#39;d like a grand travel year for &quot;kindergarten&quot; rather than stay at home and unschool.

The word &quot;Unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t even come close to explaining what it is, only what it is not, which is everything besides school.

And we have family 3000 miles away that we would spend more time with if we could afford it.  I&#39;d argue that our girls, as young as they are, remember their travels quite well as they always involve relationships with people they love to spend time with doing things they love (playing at the beach, bodyboarding, biking, baking, making art).  The kind of travel year I&#39;m imagining might involve some sightseeing, I&#39;d hope (for my benefit!), but we usually plan all our adventures with what the kids would enjoy most in mind as that&#39;s what ends up being the most fun for us all.  And DH and I both prefer travel where we are connected to experience things with locals in the know so that we experience a day in the life of a place rather than a tourist kind of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=- How much do you consider your child&#39;s expressed desires in planning big trips?-=--=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please expand on your question.

We travelled once to the UK when we had only one DD but that was for work.  Though we had no relatives there and no friends for DD, my daughter talks about it like it was the best time in her life.  She was 2.5, I was pregnant, was told to lie down as much as possible, to walk as little as possible, so i hardly took her out.  We were there for fall and freezing winter, DH was working ALL the time -- we hardly spent time with him.  I also had to painfully wean her unexpectedly which was heartwrenching.  But DD and I did everything together.  We baked and played in toystores and wandered around a freezing outdoor nighttime Winter Wonderland fair, swam (DH&#39;s boss had a heated indoor pool!) and painted A LOT.  I remember taking her to a library storytime for kids where one of the reading adults tried to make DD play an instrument that went with the story.  Neither DD nor I liked that.  I don&#39;t know how much of a &quot;cultural&quot; experience it was for DD, or even how much of it she&#39;ll remember, but I wonder if we went to New Zealand or Australia and enjoyed each other&#39;s company while exploring a bit, if we could (adults and children) both get a wonderful experience out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that my girls get homesick, though.  Since we have family in DC and Philly and we live in LA, we make a 2-3 week trip to both cities everytime we go to the east coast.  It&#39;s never enough time to really relax into it and really just enough to see all the relatives.  By the time we come back home, the girls are soooo happy to be in their home with their stuff and in our bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if international travel is a bit much to put on them, and/or if traveling longer than they&#39;re accustomed to is fair to them at this stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I&#39;ve considered is immersing ourselves in a country where they either speak Spanish or Korean (DH&#39;s and my linguistic heritages, respectively) as a way to expose our girls to those languages and cultures...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading my tome!

I ve","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-74886657\">Thanks to the generous moderators (Sandra, Joyce and Pam!) and active contributors, I am finally beginning to embrace and comprehend radical Unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read many, many pages on Sandra&#39;s site, Joyce&#39;s site and Danielle&#39;s Organic Learning site, as well as on this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted a few times with the occasional $.02, but let this be my intro as I am truly new to Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4.5 & 22 month old girls.  When I joined this list, I was frantically looking at expensive, progressive, developmental private schools for my older daughter&#39;s kindergarten next year.  Our public school is unacceptable, though I was planning on entering the lottery for a charter school -- either a progressive, Dewey based constructivist one or a Waldorf inspired one.  I kept open the option of &quot;homeschooling&quot; next year and traveling with the family as I believed at the time that play is all the school kids need at age 5!  That said, my 4.5 year old attends a home-based preschool (14 kids/day max with 2 &quot;teachers&quot; 3-4 days/wk).  The kids are free to do what they want, go in and out of the house as they please, swim, dance, play dress-up, eat from the organic edible garden, etc.  The teachers respect the children, do not talk down to them, do not belittle or praise broadly (no timeouts or &quot;good job!&quot;), do not &quot;teach&quot; them how to paint or how to play or how to read/write (unless asked).  Basically, I&#39;d love to play there, too!  And, I have, at times.  It is the only school near us I was even considering.  If we hadn&#39;t gotten in, I would have kept my eldest home.  This was before I was introduced to the concept of Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I began to understand Unschooling -- I started to see the schools I was touring as soul-killers.  I literally could see how the students were affected as they stayed in school<br/>\nlonger.  While the younger grades always had &quot;light in their eyes&quot;, the older grades had poor posture and disinterested, lifeless expressions on their faces.  Even the most inspired school, with happy, engaged students from K-8, still left me wondering how much choice the students had to pursue what they were interested in or simply, to play, or be outside when they wanted, to eat when hungry, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, my peacefully, painlessly home-birthed, AP, EC, RIE, NVC-raised daughter was developing a nervous habit licking her lips that chapped the skin around her mouth.  I had started a 60-hour/week job and one of her lifelong friends (they met at 5 months in our RIE class and have grown up together) started excluding my daughter (if she was the &quot;lucky&quot; one that day -- this &quot;friend&quot; picks one person to exclude each day) from playing with her.  I felt my time apart from my eldest was damaging her and I felt helpless to support her in the way I knew she needed.  I emailed the director of her preschool suggesting that my daughter&#39;s friend was emotionally bullying my daughter and acceptable choices to me seemed to be to take my daughter out of school or for the bullying to be dealt with in some way.  The director responded saying that we should discuss more in person but that her feeling was that my daughter was so secure that the dynamic might be happening because the friend feels less secure than my daughter.  Fortunately (or not) a family emergency took us out of town and then we had the holiday break.  My daughter&#39;s nervous habit stopped.  She returns to school tomorrow.  I wonder if things will be different between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been focusing on being connected and responsive to my daughters.  The past few weeks not working and being with them 24-7 have been magical and the first time I felt confident in my ability to truly become the mother I want to be.  I&#39;ve had long stretches being the stay-at-home mom before -- prior to my current job I&#39;d work short stints 2 weeks to 3 months and then take 6 months to a year off. I&#39;ve spent so much time, money and energy trying to get to a zen place with being a parent, but only now with my growing understanding of radical Unschooling am I achieving it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for finally embracing radical Unschooling, I was getting stuck on a few things (and DH is not yet convinced):  removing limits on TV and sweets and how socialization would happen.  I was able to let these go as I read and researched the sites mentioned above and started to change how I was interacting with my strong-willed, assertive 4.5 year old.  I worked on nurturing our connection, getting to &quot;yes&quot; more often and the results were more fun, more joy and more cooperation!  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor all the parenting learning I&#39;ve done thus far, radical Unschooling is the greatest paradigm shift for me.  I&#39;m eternally grateful but, to be honest, a little anxious about what this means for how much transition my family will go through next...as now I want to embrace radical Unschooling as best I can as soon as I can in how I&#39;m living!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I&#39;m rambling a bit, but this is all relevant to the input I&#39;m asking for....Think of it as a &quot;monkey platter&quot; of things to chew on.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the things I&#39;m seeking input on:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) What&#39;s the best way to get my DH exposed to experienced radical Unschoolers?  He&#39;s a seeing is believing kind of guy.  He&#39;s not likely going to read a book or a blog or join a discussion group.  He&#39;s open-minded, but it takes him exposure and time to process what he thinks.  Every step of our parenting journey, he&#39;s been reluctant to embrace my ideas, but once exposed and informed, he&#39;s grateful to have learned a new way of doing and being.  I believe he will (eventually) embrace radical Unschooling, though he&#39;s already told me that he can&#39;t imagine Unschooling our two girls by himself full-time.  Which leads me to my next issue --<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I am currently working 60+ hour weeks and he&#39;s a stay-at-home dad.  My job gets our health benefits and a great paycheck.  My project ends in August and quitting before would put a huge black mark on my reputation.  I work freelance in film editing.  The recession plus technological advances have brought down wages and increased unemployment in my field.  I could quit to unschool and ask DH to work, but my earning potential is higher and I get health and pension benefits while DH does not.  If I were to quit, I&#39;d have to anticipate that it may be very difficult to get work if/when I&#39;d need it.  My issue here is two-fold:   If I wait to radically unschool until after my current project is over in August, while I will have savings (and health insurance) that will take care of us for a while, is that worth the potential damage not Unschooling will do in the meantime?  And, if DH is not yet on board with Unschooling, is it more prudent to give him time to meet some Unschoolers and process it for himself before doing anything radically different?  He definitely still has a pretty big &quot;I&#39;m your dad, you can&#39;t talk to me like that!&quot; kind of knee-jerk parenting at times.  He&#39;s aware of it and working on it, but he was raised by strict, controlling parents, so it&#39;s taking time, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) When DH has a battle of wills with our eldest, how do I advocate for DD in a way that brings more connection to all?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) DH wants to move forward with our private school applications even though I&#39;ve told him that I think Unschooling is the best way to educate (and protect!) our kids.  If we are still at odds about &quot;kindergarten&quot; when it&#39;s time to decide (spring), how does a decision get made where everyone can be ok with the outcome?  Under what circumstances can Unschooling work if only one parent wants to unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) I asked my 4.5 yo daughter about having family time all the time instead of going to school.  She said that she&#39;d like it if she could go to school maybe 2 days a week and spend the rest with our family.  Her reference for school is free-play as I mentioned above.  We haven&#39;t yet wholeheartedly unschooled where I&#39;m 100% present and actively feeding her interest.  I think I can make home more interesting than even her play-based school but she doesn&#39;t yet have a truly unschooly day to measure school against.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is extroverted (she gains energy engaging with others) and will introduce herself to potential playmates immediately when she gets to a playground.  I doubt any of the other kids who will graduate from her preschool will unschool or Homeschool next year.  How do I address her desire for &quot;school&quot; and explain what we will be doing next year?  <br/>\n<br/>\n6) If DH gets on the unschool bus sooner than later, I&#39;d like a grand travel year for &quot;kindergarten&quot; rather than stay at home and unschool.  How much do you consider your child&#39;s expressed desires in planning big trips?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve brought up a lot, and I don&#39;t expect feedback on it all.  Any unschooly, experienced wisdom would be greatly appreciated...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nCeci Hyoun<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Signed my full name as a response to Sandra&#39;s point about anonymity.  If I never understood radical Unschooling, or no one made an issue of anonymity, I probably would have never signed my complete name.  I treat forums like a town hall meeting -- a good conversation may lead to giving my full name, but most times, even my first name may not be shared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iDon&#39;tAlwaysHaveItOnPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58842,"nextTopicId":58836}}
