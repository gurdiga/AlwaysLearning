When I went to school, my parents (and everyone&#39;s parents I knew) were completely hands-off.  My parents never once asked us if our homework was done.  Never, ever checked our homework (this was in the 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s).  My brothers got by in school w/ c&#39;s and d&#39;s, I did well and got a&#39;s and b&#39;s, and generally enjoyed school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids previous private school ask us parents to by hyper-involved in their schooling.  That was one of the things that led me to homeschooling.  I was tired of the teachers asking us parents to teach the kids their multiplication tables at home (in the evenings and on the weekends), and assigning all these silly at home projects, that no child could possibly do on their own, so they were &#39;parent&#39; projects.  I felt like &quot;you&#39;re asking me to educate my child, so I will&quot;, and I pulled them from school, and they&#39;ve been blossoming ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to find that middle ground.  I was hoping for some examples, like I needed when I first pulled my kids from school &quot;how does your family homeschool exactly?&quot;  Those examples helped me so much.  Same with all of Sandra&#39;s essays in &quot;moving a puddle&quot;... the specific ideas  of unschooling given are such a help.  I&#39;m picturing her homework and projects being put off, and her asking for my help at 10pm, which is not something I&#39;d want to do.  (I&#39;m asleep by 10pm most nights).  On the other hand, I want to support her, be her partner, be her mom.  I need some examples of that wonderful &#39;middle ground&#39;, because I don&#39;t have any in my real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 28, 2012 at 10:31 AM, Liz &lt;lizjane68@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, when she&#39;s in school and she comes to me saying &quot;we have this book for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homework, will you read it to me?&quot; (or help her with her math sheets she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be getting, etc), how do I handle this?

She&#39;s an extremely social person, and she cannot get enough social experiences during our day to day life and thinks trying school would be &quot;fun&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been homeschooling for the past 3 years (I pulled her and ds10 from a very small, private school when they were in 4th/2nd grades). We&#39;re a part of a homeschool group that meets once a week for classes/park day, frequent events and field trips, which we participate in almost all.  Daughter has many great friends (from past school, homeschool group, x-box live) who all facetime, do x-box live, text, call etc.  She&#39;s frequently walking around our house talking to a few different kids at the same time (one on her cell phone, one on the x-box headset, one on her computer, etc).  She also takes dance classes 3 nights a week and has friends there, and takes an art class once a week, and wants to try singing lessons again too.  Her cousin (same age) and some dance friends go to this school, and are all excited she&#39;s thinking about attending.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;re looking into it.  I had read in Sandra&#39;s &quot;Moving A Puddle&quot; (what a fantastic book) that letting your child go to school, but making it &quot;their&quot; responsibility entirely, was a way to be sure it&#39;s really &quot;theirs&quot;, as an experience.  I&#39;m all for this.  I told her she first has to get herself on the would-be school schedule for a few weeks, of waking up at 6am and getting herself ready for the bus which comes past our house at 6:50am.  I don&#39;t want to enroll her in school, talk to the office (who have been wonderful with us in our homeschooling journey), have everything set, and have her not show up.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI explained to her that I won&#39;t be waking her up, forcing her to &quot;hurry up and get ready&quot;, that&#39;s it&#39;s her own thing to do.  But I will get up with her and make her breakfast and see her off.  I told her I won&#39;t be checking her homework unless she asks me for help, I won&#39;t be reminding her to make sure she has the proper books, etc.  When my kids went to school, I was &quot;Mrs. School&quot;... at every event, volunteered for everything, was on top of the kids w/ all homework (as the teachers wanted us to be).  I was in the school volunteering every day (lunch/recess work).  Anyway, I told her it won&#39;t be like that.  I told her she can come back home at any time during her school experience.  But that she cannot go back and forth.  I think she thought she could be absent as much as she wants and I would tell them we&#39;re homeschooling her again, then she can attend just when she feels like it.  She really wishes it was a part time thing, so she could do both school and be at home.  I also think she thinks it will be one big fun-fest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for her homeschooling experience, she loves her freedom with being home.  She&#39;s grown soooo much as a person, and discovered things she loves, that I just know wouldn&#39;t have had the opportunity to surface if we were back on that dreaded school schedule.  No time to find true passions.  She knows this too.  It&#39;s just what she perceives as the social fun of school is calling out to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, who was so against pulling them from school in the first place 3 years ago, said he had a stomachache and heartache when we told him of the school thoughts.  He just loves having them home now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m prepared to have this experience be &#39;hers&#39;, but I also want to continue to &quot;parent&quot; her.  I don&#39;t want her to feel I&#39;ve abandoned her because I don&#39;t really want her to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn her life at home, she asks me to read to her, do &quot;math work&quot; with her (she&#39;s fascinated with fractions at the moment and she loves the Life of Fred math series), study countries, states, people with her.  We do lots of *around the world* nights, science fairs, art fairs, etc, with our homeschool group, and she always asks me to do the projects with her.  She says she&#39;s going to miss all this immensely if she goes to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when she&#39;s in school and she comes to me saying &quot;we have this book for homework, will you read it to me?&quot; (or help her with her math sheets she&#39;ll be getting, etc), how do I handle this?  I want to say that she has to do it herself, because this is her experience.  She will probably say (or think), &quot;you did these things with me when we homeschooled, and now you won&#39;t because I&#39;m in school.&quot;  This is what I&#39;m struggling with.
