It was a natural progression for me <br/>\nthat if I trusted my children in some areas, why shouldn&#39;t I be <br/>\ntrusting them in all areas?  I kept hearing all the voices spoken to me <br/>\nover the years about how children need to be guided and taught how to <br/>\ndo everything because they were incapable of doing anything on their <br/>\nown that didn&#39;t personally benefit them.

The key <br/>\nfor me was supporting my children, not supporting the school system.  <br/>\nWe talked about the rules at school and consequences of not following <br/>\nthem.  I always let my children make the choices though.  I helped <br/>\nthem see things from many angles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter went to public school for all of 3rd grade.  I <br/>\nwas sure she&#39;d tire of it after a few months and want to come back <br/>\nhome.  I was really surprised that she stayed all year.  She even <br/>\nchose to go back for 4th grade.  After one month of 4th grade, Allie <br/>\ndecided school wasn&#39;t meeting her needs anymore and she came back <br/>\nhome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has always been in school.  Her father and I are <br/>\ndivorced which adds an element of challenge to parenting.  She&#39;s <br/>\nlived with me for the past 2 years, attending the local public high <br/>\nschool.  My parenting style is so very different from her dad&#39;s and <br/>\nso her school experience has been different.  I give her complete <br/>\nfreedom to make choices.  Her dad would manipulate her into doing <br/>\nthings he felt was best for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I don&#39;t want to be negative about their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard not to be negative if your personal experiences have been <br/>\nnegative.  But remember that you are likely raising your children <br/>\ndifferently than you were raised.  They are approaching all things <br/>\nwith a different attitude than you likely did.  Their experience at <br/>\nschool might just be like any other experience such as taking a <br/>\nclass, joining a club, or just trying something new.  The other kids <br/>\nat school have no choice to be there.  Your children do have a <br/>\nchoice.  My children always knew when they were in school that they <br/>\ncould leave at any time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now my concern, worry, apprehension (I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; feeling) is... what if she does like it??  Do some kids go to<br/>\n&gt; school by choice and actually enjoy being there?  Will she<br/>\n&gt; eventually realize what a waste of time it is?? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Been there, done that.  I had to remove myself from their <br/>\nexperience.  I think my kids know when something is a waste of time.  <br/>\nUntil they feel that way though, it&#39;s not a waste.  It&#39;s an <br/>\nexperience just like anything else they may try.  My feelings were <br/>\nactually hurt when Allie didn&#39;t want to quit 3rd grade.  I really <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand what she was getting from being at school.  But <br/>\nthen again, I&#39;m not walking in her shoes.  As long as things were <br/>\nworking out for her and she was feeling good, that meant things were <br/>\ngoing well.  She did reach a point where she felt school was no <br/>\nlonger meeting her needs.  But she also freely admits that she may <br/>\nnot be finished with school.  She knows she doesn&#39;t want to go this <br/>\nyear which would be her 5th grade year, but she has an interest in <br/>\ntrying middle school and high school.  We just take it one year at a <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276672239,"authorName":"lauermjkd1","from":"&quot;lauermjkd1&quot; &lt;6sqwooeywabbitz@...&gt;","profile":"lauermjkd1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Are there degrees of unschooling?","postDate":"1217429878","msgId":36915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2cHZobStic243QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgyRjk3NzY2LTU2MjAtNEVDNy04NkFFLUFFRkQ1RUJBMjg5RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36913,"nextInTopic":36916,"prevInTime":36914,"nextInTime":36916,"topicId":36899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was a<br/>\n&gt; good conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The conversations are where the magic happens in our family.

I could take a negative stance and tell them how I<br/>\nthink that school is not the most conducive place to learn about life<br/>\n(but they know that I feel that way).  But I don&#39;t want to be negative<br/>\nabout their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s quite an adjustment for me. I had a conversation with Lydia today<br/>\nand took your advice Sandra and said that schools can create a<br/>\ndistance between some parents and that is one of my worries.  It was a<br/>\ngood conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though it&#39;s not compulsory for them, I wonder if what we are<br/>\ndoing is still unschooling?  I shouldn&#39;t worry about what I am<br/>\nconsidered though, and just realize that I&#39;m trying to make their life<br/>\nhappy and support their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took our paperwork in and the principal again asked me if I wanted<br/>\nto have Lydia &quot;tested&quot; for &quot;enrichment&quot;.  I&#39;m so bad and just had to<br/>\nsay &quot;don&#39;t all kids deserve enrichment?&quot; :)!  I said we&#39;ll just see<br/>\nhow things go and see what she wants to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my concern, worry, apprehension (I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m<br/>\nfeeling) is... what if she does like it??  Do some kids go to school<br/>\nby choice and actually enjoy being there?  Will she eventually realize<br/>\nwhat a waste of time it is??  I should probably be working on getting<br/>\nrid of these negative attitudes of mine towards school??  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is difficult.  Has anyone else been through this??<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\namy g<br/>\niowa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-In another note, she said that list and<br/>\n&gt; others like it don&#39;t own the idea of unschooling and that there are<br/>\n&gt; different degrees of unschooling. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Are there degrees of unschooling?","postDate":"1217389726","msgId":36902,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyQkM1OTlFLTFEQjQtNEE1Qi1CNTIwLTU4NzQxQzgwQzI5M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc2b2MyYit0N2VpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc2b2MyYit0N2VpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36899,"nextInTopic":36903,"prevInTime":36901,"nextInTime":36903,"topicId":36899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-In another note, she said that list and others like it don t own the idea of unschooling and that there are different degrees of unschooling. -=- She s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-799721141\">-=-In another note, she said that list and<br/>\nothers like it don&#39;t own the idea of unschooling and that there are<br/>\ndifferent degrees of unschooling. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who spent six hours a day (only 180 days a year) encouraging  <br/>\ntheir children to learn school subjects in creative and individual  <br/>\nand non-schoolish ways could say &quot;unschooling&quot; and it would be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey wouldn&#39;t be unschooling as well as our family did (in my opinion  <br/>\nand experience), but they would be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is unschooling that barely cuts it and unschooling that  <br/>\ntransforms families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have unfinished collections of different unschooling &quot;degrees&quot; and  <br/>\nfacets.
