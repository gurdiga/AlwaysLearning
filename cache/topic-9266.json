What I did when my ds was 5 and dd 2 was move a bunk bed into our bedroom.  It fit perfectly between our bed and the wall.  My dd slept on the bottom and ds slept on the top.  It made bedtime so much easier for us.  My husband and I didn&#39;t sleep well with the kids in our bed so that just wasn&#39;t a long term option for us.  Usually they stayed up until 10pm with us and we all went to bed together but sometimes they went earlier, while we were still up, and watched a movie in our room.  The kids were in our room for about 1 1/2 years and then we moved them back to their own rooms when they and we were ready. We don&#39;t have many bedtime problems now.....ds9 and dd6.  They usually sleep together in her room or his or even the living room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85626510,"authorName":"Dawn Falbe","from":"&quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;astrologerdawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bedtimes for real","postDate":"1031668186","msgId":9266,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzIwMWMyNThkNiQ4OTU1NGUzMCQxNDhlZGQxOEBkYXduPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzE2MzM3MjAuMjA5Ni40NDM4NC5tMTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9268,"prevInTime":9265,"nextInTime":9267,"topicId":9266,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All: So I m back to the bedtimes dilemma again...
