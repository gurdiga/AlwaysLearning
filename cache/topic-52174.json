I remember having my oldest be four and thinking that I needed to expose him to everything now, now, now!  My friend and I were just laughing about all the science experiments and things we did so that they would have all those things &quot;under their belts&quot;--and now they don&#39;t even remember them.  We are doing science experiments now and what they are getting out of them is so very different I can&#39;t even tell you--now our boys are 14 and 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not at all to say not to do science experiments--but just do them for the fun and enjoyment.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d go back and do, in this respect, if I had my boy four again.  Although childhood is fleeting in one sense, there is also plenty of time for all of this stuff, and for our kids to come to stuff as they are ready.  There will be so many thousands of conversations with your daughter by the time she is 14 in which you will discuss all sorts of things, including mindfulness when it actually has meaning for her as a practice.  Before then, she&#39;ll be watching you--how you react, how you process your emotions, and I&#39;ll be that will have a much bigger internal impact on her than a class that is appealing to an intellect that isn&#39;t yet ready to incorporate these abstract thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil kids are a certain age, we really aren&#39;t self-concious in a way necessary for mindfulness to have meaning.  We just are.  Our kids ARE having a direct experience with being present and in the moment.  I think trying to impose a structure before there&#39;s substance to support it is, in essence, a waste of time and money.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-...thinking about ways to enhance her brain/her potential-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to enhance her brain potential IS to have fun, talk, laugh, play, be silly, explore share, etc.  That IS it--nothing more--but that&#39;s A LOT.

I have a magnet on my fridge that says, Trust Children. I got it from Jan Hunt&#39;s website - naturalchild.org.  My original post had more to do with offering mindfulness (Buddhism) to children. In Los Angeles, specifically, Santa Monica where I live, they offer mindfulness classes to children starting at age 4. Currently, I am &quot;studying&quot; mindfulness&#39;s effect on adult brains. I am finding all the information I am finding regarding neuroplasticity fascinating and I can&#39;t help but wonder - would it be helpful if I introduce certain aspects of mindfulness to my daughter?

Maybe it all can be that way - we walk by something and we try it and then we find ways to do it at home and I just let that be instead of thinking about ways to enhance her brain/her potential - something that does not fit into unschooling.

It&#39;s what someone turns to to help them  <br/>\ndecide if an idea is right or wrong for them. It can apply to a part  <br/>\nof life, like a child&#39;s learning, or all of life. Generally I&#39;d say a  <br/>\nphilosophy is something you&#39;re willing to make your life more  <br/>\ndifficult for in order to stick with it. How difficult someone is  <br/>\nwilling to make their life depends. Some people are willing to die  <br/>\nfor their philosophy. Or sacrifice their only son ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the specific people I&#39;m thinking of, natural living was definitely  <br/>\na philosophy, if not a life philosophy. It formed the foundation of  <br/>\ntheir life choices. Organic food. Organic gardening. Composting. No  <br/>\nplastic. No commercial TV. I didn&#39;t get the feeling they&#39;d die for it  <br/>\nthough ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone also has a collection of values that shift in priority  <br/>\ndepending on the situation that don&#39;t necessarily form a cohesive  <br/>\nwhole. (And some *only* have a shifting collection.) It might be  <br/>\nlabeled a personal philosophy though in my mind a personal philosophy  <br/>\nmeans someone has given the collection some thought. It&#39;s not just a  <br/>\nmish mosh with choices based on current mood ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance I value being conservative with money, being green,  <br/>\nbuying food with fewer chemicals. Which of those takes precedence  <br/>\ndepends on the situation. May depend on whim. May depend on some  <br/>\nother value being more important (like saving time, for instance.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When an aspect of an interest bumps up against a value, we are  <br/>\n&gt; finding ways to work through this. It&#39;s challenging to examine our  <br/>\n&gt; dearly-held values in light of this whole life unschooling  <br/>\n&gt; philosophy, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s what happens with a philosophy. :-) It can help people  <br/>\nsee a bigger picture, feel like they have a goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t consider what we are moving  <br/>\n&gt; into as whole life (radical) unschooling based on our prior values?  <br/>\n&gt; Especially if we are &quot;mindful of&quot; (as in &quot;attentive to&quot;) potential  <br/>\n&gt; conflicts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not entirely sure of what you&#39;re asking. But my guess would be it  <br/>\ndepends where your priorities end up being. For instance if parents  <br/>\nvalue organic food and children exploring their interests, when those  <br/>\ntwo conflict, if the parents are mostly choosing one over the other  <br/>\nit&#39;s a good indication of which is most important, which is their  <br/>\noverriding philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not totally cut and dried. Just because I wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>\nsacrificed my life to allow Kathryn to unschool, doesn&#39;t mean I  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t think of myself as a radical unschooler ;-) What&#39;s  <br/>\nimportant is that someone is making thoughtful choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what&#39;s important *here* on this list, is helping people with the  <br/>\nparts of their life they&#39;re deliberately trying to make more  <br/>\ndifficult by choosing to unschool. If someone decides their children  <br/>\nneed to be vegetarian rather than explore their own interests in  <br/>\nfood, the purpose of the list isn&#39;t to help them compromise  <br/>\nunschooling. They need to figure out how to mesh the two themselves.  <br/>\nOr on a vegetarian list since they&#39;re putting the vegetarian  <br/>\nphilosophy above unschooling.

And I wonder if sometimes our values bump up against our unschooling philosophy and we just need to sort that out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, we value reducing our ecological &quot;foot print&quot; and talk about ways to do that (my kid loves to watch The Story of Stuff). We also value purchasing toys, etc. that are most likely not to contain lead or other yucky things (although there are no guarantees). And we are long-time vegetarians (although my son is welcome to eat meat if/when he decides to) and choose organic as often as possible. Some of our values (and life choices) might make us look like &quot;natural living&quot; folks but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s an all encompassing life philosophy for our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are, however, embracing a deeper unschooling philosophy in our family - one that extends to our whole life together. We strongly desire to support our child&#39;s interests and make them a priority. When an aspect of an interest bumps up against a value, we are finding ways to work through this. It&#39;s challenging to examine our dearly-held values in light of this whole life unschooling philosophy, but it&#39;s worth it. It seems to be part of my internal &quot;stretching&quot;  right now - and part of &quot;saying yes&quot; more often - and working things out, together, as a family when that yes just isn&#39;t forthcoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does that mean that we shouldn&#39;t consider what we are moving into as whole life (radical) unschooling based on our prior values? Especially if we are &quot;mindful of&quot; (as in &quot;attentive to&quot;) potential conflicts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a sincere question and one I&#39;ve been wondering about. It might be that we will eventually say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; and leave it at that - or use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; to only talk about how we approach learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca (who realizes that this may be a better question for the Unschooling Basics list but wanted to respond within the context of this thread)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling & mindfulness","postDate":"1269138686","msgId":52191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvNDBkdStrcGZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyQ0JEQkM1LUVGOTktNDRCMS04RUQ2LTQ1RENCMUUxMjEwQ0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":52188,"nextInTopic":52197,"prevInTime":52190,"nextInTime":52192,"topicId":52174,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The main thing that makes radical unschooling work is to really key into our children so that we can support and facilitate their learning and growth in their whole lives--including emotional.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNVC can support that for some people--helping to give them more insight into their own emotional states so that they are more able to empathize with their children.  But it&#39;s not necessary for everyone--some parents don&#39;t need those skills, and it can end up being another layer that gets in the way rather than helping.  Trying to impose someone else&#39;s (in this case, Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s) system can overlay their own and inhibit the natural connection they already have with their kids.  Some people may get a lot out of it, and it can help improve their relationships, but others are awkwardly trying to use a script in a way that feels like ill-fitting clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Unschooling & mindfulness","postDate":"1269115368","msgId":52188,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcyQ0JEQkM1LUVGOTktNDRCMS04RUQ2LTQ1RENCMUUxMjEwQ0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDA5REIxMkY3LTJBQTEtNDhCNi1BRThDLTQzQzlGOUQ0RjUxMUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":52186,"nextInTopic":52191,"prevInTime":52187,"nextInTime":52189,"topicId":52174,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If a child&#39;s interests  <br/>\n-- like snack foods or Spongebob cartoons or cheap plastic toys --  <br/>\nlay beyond mom&#39;s definition of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;wholesome&quot;  <br/>\nshe needs to compromise unschooling to make natural living work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably easier and clearer to focus on one philosophy and add  <br/>\npractices and ideas from other philosophies that help it work even  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; NVC does fall into mindfulness.
