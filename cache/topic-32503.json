And  <br/>\nwe&#39;ve known him for three years, and he was a friend of Kirby&#39;s even  <br/>\nbefore then.  So he&#39;s fully vetted by Kirby and Marty and Holly.   <br/>\nShe&#39;s known him since she was 13.  He&#39;s been to several parties  <br/>\nhere.  He came to my birthday party last summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wouldn&#39;t like him if he weren&#39;t pretty special, because the  <br/>\nstream of friends of her brothers has been constant for years, and  <br/>\nmost of those guys weren&#39;t interesting to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey flirted and talked, but he had two girlfriends in that time (the  <br/>\nfirst one had been his girlfriend since they were 15), but it started  <br/>\nlooking to me a few months ago that it was inevitable that they would  <br/>\nend up a couple.  I knew it before they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had never predicted that Holly would like someone older than  <br/>\neither of her brothers, but for years we&#39;ve been happy with the fact  <br/>\nthat Kirby&#39;s friends were younger and older than he is, and Marty&#39;s,  <br/>\nand...  well...<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you should *not* tell this story to your friend with the ten  <br/>\nyear old.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and the young man are being open and he hangs around here, and  <br/>\nhas talked to everyone in the family and their friends, some of whom  <br/>\nthought it might be illegal to even think about it.  A friend of mine  <br/>\nis an assistant DA and I checked legalities with him just before  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s 16th birthday.  It all varies state by state, but as long as  <br/>\nthe older male doesn&#39;t work at a school she attends or at a hospital  <br/>\nin which she&#39;s being treated, it&#39;s her option.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe coolest thing about it for me is that she is SO not in a hurry.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s very sweet and calm.  They hold hands.  They&#39;ve been listening  <br/>\nto a lot of Donovan together.  They&#39;re going on a picnic tomorrow.   <br/>\nHe&#39;s in grad school and she insisted that he do his homework last  <br/>\nnight before they hung out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn high school if a boy would pay much attention to me I was  <br/>\nimmediately besotted.  And part of school&#39;s pressure is reporting  <br/>\neach day to your friends what you&#39;ve done, or why not.  She has no  <br/>\nsuch pressure at all, and the boy knows we would run him off if he  <br/>\nwere not treating her the way we wanted  him to.  He likes Kirby and  <br/>\nMarty so much he would hate to lose those friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly said he told her yesterday that it was lucky for him the Dodd  <br/>\nfamily had a girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58132404,"authorName":"MarSi77@aol.com","from":"MarSi77@...","profile":"m6hschch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: control,choice,teens ... need a response","postDate":"1204153434","msgId":32517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkOS4yYjc1MTg0Yi4zNGY3NDY1YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32513,"nextInTopic":32519,"prevInTime":32516,"nextInTime":32518,"topicId":32503,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/27/2008 4:00:50 P.M.
