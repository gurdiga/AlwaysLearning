The board has (for example) 7x2 and when they press down the button it shows the answer.  I am so opposed to anything schoolish it kind of made me cringe (but I have learned to be careful about this) but he loved it just for fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI only say all that because he got another cool math game-thing at Christmas (all my relatives give the boys resource books or &quot;educational&quot; toys since we started unschooling.  Anyone else notice that phenomenon? It used to annoy me, now I have learned to appreciate the cool things they get), and playing with that prompted him to get out his multiplication board.  He and my husband started talking about why we use multiplication (shortcut for adding).  My son tried to figure out two &quot;problems&quot; my husband threw out there and couldn&#39;t, so my son got very frustrated.  To his credit, my husband kept talking to him about the concepts and you could almost literally see the lightbulb go off in my son&#39;s head.  Then my husband started throwing some &quot;problems&quot; out there an he answered every one (no help from the board).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt amazed me.  I have such math anxiety because of the way it was taught to me in school that it makes this even more significant. My son learned multiplication, without any pressure to do so, just because it was cool, in 10 minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe probably spent months in school trying to learn the same thing.  No one told me it was fun, no one told me it was OK to experiment until it made sense to me.  And to this day I tense up if I have to solve a math problem. Crazy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to mention this because I think a lot of us think it&#39;s hard to learn stuff, or we think we have to push it because who the heck would WANT to learn it?  But it is helpful I think to remember stories like this and also understand, as Joyce said, that schools often make &quot;learning&quot; a lot harder than it is.  Maybe to justify their existence, maybe to fill the days, maybe because no one thinks about having fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood to always keep in mind that for adults or for kids, it really does not take long at all to learn something that is interesting to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  I hesitated to write this because this particluar bit of learning was so schoolish looking.  So I want to be clear I am not advocating that this is the only way someone can learn math; kids use math all the time in video games, when they want to save up for something, or even when they are trying to figure out how many days until their birthday. And as Joyce said: &quot;as a side effect of exploring their interests&quot;.   My son just happens to like the concrete-ness of looking at the numbers and seeing what can be done with them.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"jo kirby","from":"jo kirby &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Deschooling competitive perfectionists","postDate":"1325770022","msgId":64733,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjU3NzAwMjIuMzc2MjEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJFRjNEMTE0LUQ5MTItNEUzOC1BMkJBLTFFN0M4MDlGODE0Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhDNUVEMzVELUVDMEYtNDVDOC1BOTcxLUNDNDBBQjBDMEFDNEB5YWhvby5jb20+IDxqZTJhZnQrcmhldUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDEzMjU3MTMxODguNDc2NTUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDJFRjNEMTE0LUQ5MTItNEUzOC1BMkJBLTFFN0M4MDlGODE0Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64728,"nextInTopic":64734,"prevInTime":64732,"nextInTime":64734,"topicId":64715,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Ceci, these are some which my son played the most (in no particular order): Dino Train - you have to find dinosaur eggs amongst the landscape.

I mean, for your daughter, collecting stickers might not be about getting &#39;rewards&#39;, it might be about the joy of putting a collection together and/or making it into a picture. And getting as many coins as possible might be about a challenge for herself of seeing how many she can pile up, or whether the game ever suprises her with something other than a coin, or about getting a certain number... My point is, you probably don&#39;t know/can&#39;t know what her real motivation is, but if she&#39;s enjoying it, trust that it&#39;s some good reason, not something to worry about like she&#39;s less interested in learning than in reaching a goal. The two are inseparable, and that&#39;s why you got the apps in the first place: because your daughters like collecting coins and stickers! They WILL learn along the way if they&#39;re enjoying the games.

The talking was a way to communicate about what they liked.

Kathryn learned most of her math from playing Mario Bros. video games. And she did just fine in the college math courses she took. Admittedly she does have a head for math, but seriously, math was learned by using it for real purposes not for the purposes of learning math.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Deschooling competitive perfectionists","postDate":"1325688637","msgId":64716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCNzYyMUNBLTAzQjgtNEMwMS05Q0ZBLUZCOEM0MDM1NTIzREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNUVEMzVELUVDMEYtNDVDOC1BOTcxLUNDNDBBQjBDMEFDNEB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhDNUVEMzVELUVDMEYtNDVDOC1BOTcxLUNDNDBBQjBDMEFDNEB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64715,"nextInTopic":64717,"prevInTime":64715,"nextInTime":64717,"topicId":64715,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=it seems to me that if getting the rewards are what they are interested in, maybe I should find a game that fits their interest rather than an educational","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-654792942\">-=it seems to me that if getting the rewards are what they are interested in, maybe I should find a game that fits their interest rather than an educational app that has a game-like appeal?
