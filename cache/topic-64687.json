Sometimes I&#39;ll suggest she take a break or ask if she wants a snack, but generally those aren&#39;t helpful if she&#39;s already worked up.

When I was about 5, I started playing songs by ear on my little toy piano. My parents did the natural thing for many parents to do and put me in piano lessons. My teacher was wonderfully nice, but she didn&#39;t encourage experimentation.  She wanted me to learn how to read music, so I wasn&#39;t allowed to watch her hands as she played, that way I couldn&#39;t &quot;cheat&quot;.  I only learned classical music, which isn&#39;t a passion of mine, but I almost pursued a piano performance degree in college because I wanted to continue playing music, but didn&#39;t know how.  So I&#39;m just now, at 30, trying to figure out my relationship to music.

From a very early age, I had a lot of input from a close relative telling me I was damaging my son&#39;s artistic expression, since he was not drawing himself...but finally I figured out (with supportive help from others) that it really was not damaging him in any way at all. It was a wonderful way to be close and communicate and explore. My son now does also do his own drawings, and will still ask me to draw for him too, after a good few years of me doing all the drawing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if your son is free to be expressive in other ways, then it&#39;s maybe (in my opinion) not so very important to be expressive through any particular medium. So a pencil or crayons or paint on paper may not be such a top priority with some children as, say, story telling or Lego. That was my thought at the time. I think my critical relative&#39;s experience was a classic academic school experience, and art was the only real means of free expression they had, and that gave it a certain huge weighty gravitas...and a skewed importance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thought - sometimes my son wants to colour in drawings but doesn&#39;t like how his colouring goes outside the lines. Sometimes I mask off the edges of drawings (with masking tape, but there are other things you can use like masking fluid or card stencils). Other times I offer to cut out the picture once he has coloured it in (which cuts away the &#39;stray&#39; lines). He sometimes will opt for one of those options, or art directing, or doing his own art, or a combination. And sometimes he will join in a picture I start.<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nCornelia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Helping young children","postDate":"1325605984","msgId":64708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0MUI0OTRFLTQyRkItNDFFOC1BNkVBLUFEMDdCRTAyMzE5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFNjc5OEE2N0VCRDQ1NzdBQTA0MDkxNjdDNUNFMkJBQG93bmVyUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDdFNjc5OEE2N0VCRDQ1NzdBQTA0MDkxNjdDNUNFMkJBQG93bmVyUEM+"},"prevInTopic":64707,"nextInTopic":64711,"prevInTime":64707,"nextInTime":64709,"topicId":64687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Maybe not quite the same as your topic, but it felt the same to me!

If he doesn&#39;t want to do it, is the craft itself fulfilling a purpose that will lead to a better relationship between child and parent?  Might it be better to do something less permanent--sand or mud play, or playdough, or painting with water on a wall or hot sidewalk (not the season for it in England, but some places, and some other times)?

In fact, he watched me ride my bike forever before he decided to give it a try.  He used to ask me to ride around and around on the driveway at our house.  Then, when he did try, he got it almost immediately, and told everyone who asked that he got it because he thought about it for a long time first.  I didn&#39;t really understand how you could learn to ride a bike by thinking about it first, but now I believe a lot of learning (with Ethan, anyway) may happen vicariously...like learning to talk.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"jo kirby","from":"jo kirby &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Helping young children","postDate":"1325522615","msgId":64687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjU1MjI2MTUuODk5NTUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA1Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":""},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64689,"prevInTime":64686,"nextInTime":64688,"topicId":64687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All, Here is something which has been on my mind for a while and I would be very interested to hear what you all think...

I have never pushed him to do anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, and have always helped when he&#39;s asked me to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do a wide variety of stuff, sometimes open minded explorations of materials, sometimes a starting idea which he or I might suggest. Generally he leads the ideas, and I make suggestions. Even when it&#39;s a craft kit type of thing, we often diverge from the way it&#39;s designed to be because he has an alternative idea. Our craft sessions often it feels very lovely, very connecting and close, and we both seem to be having a good time just hanging out together working on something.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor quite a while he has been interested in things being realistic, for example he likes colouring to be neat, he likes pictures to look realistic, he likes the scale of things to match (I mean, he doesn&#39;t want to play with two animals together, or have two animals in a drawing, if the scales don&#39;t match). I think for these reasons he often asks me to help, by which he means do the actual making bit for him, because he knows it will probably be more realistic and neater than he could do it. I am happy to help, and I do so willingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe usually stays beside me directing what he wants me to do as I draw/cut/whatever, and often gets very excited about what&#39;s coming. Other times if he seems like he might be getting a bit bored I ask if he wants me to carry on drawing/cutting/etc or shall we change and do something else now. He always refers to our projects as ours, so I&#39;m sure he feels very involved and not left out. I realise it is totally his choice to ask me to do these things for him - I see it that he is using my skills and experience to get the results he wants, and that is wonderful. He does sometimes draw/make stuff by himself, but more often than not he will have me do it for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area on my mind is how to balance adult help with a concern that by doing it for him I am &#39;doing him out of&#39; something so potentially enjoyable?: the exploration of the materials and making itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of times I have suggested &quot;why don&#39;t you have a go?&quot; and he says it won&#39;t be as neat etc. What are your thoughts/experiences in this area?<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64768,"nextTopicId":64849}}
