I follow the Torah, because I believe it contains teachings about how to best show our love for others, our community, our bodies, ourselves and God.  The important thing is the relationships- with God and others.  I am not responsible for my children&#39;s decisions regarding their relationship with God or how they express it.  I am only responsible for how I live my life, how I treat others including my children, and for introducing my children to God.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe types of issues brought up in this thread don&#39;t come up very often in my house, partially because my children are so young and partially because I only follow the Torah, not the rabbinical laws, so there is a lot less.  On thing that has come up is the issue of eating Kosher, especially since my husband does not.  But again, Biblical Kosher is actually pretty easy to keep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, my daughter wanted marshmellows at the store and I said no.  But I also said that I will look for some Kosher ones somewhere else and she has a whole huge array of candy options that I do joyfully buy for her every time we go shopping.  So, it wasn&#39;t a big deal to her.  If it had been a big deal and that was what she really wanted right then and couldn&#39;t wait for me to find the Kosher ones, I would have bought them.  Then stocked up on Kosher ones for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has said many times here to make the better of two choices and that resonates with me on this level as well.  When I am in a dilemma of personal beliefs vs. possibly damaging a relationship I will pick the option that builds the relationship.  Then look for solutions that can accomodate both.  If that means I break Torah while I am at it, I am not concerned about God striking me with lightening.  I&#39;m always growing and learning, and since I believe Torah is about relationships anyway, I trust that he will help me find a way to keep relationships the priority while keeping Torah. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Principles vs. Covert Rules","postDate":"1279386763","msgId":56117,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxOUFCODQ5LUMxMjItNENENi05QzBFLUYzNkQwNkRCRTQzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3NjQzODc1LTVERUEtNDkwQS1BQjEzLTlCOEYwNzZGQjk2OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDRDM0YxMDY3LjkwOTAxMDhAeWFob28uY2E+IDw0QzNGMzg4Ni4zMDMwODA2QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDw1NzY0Mzg3NS01REVBLTQ5MEEtQUIxMy05QjhGMDc2RkI5NjlAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":56116,"nextInTopic":56123,"prevInTime":56116,"nextInTime":56118,"topicId":56055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It s not about us acting in ways we believe are enough for them to trust us.

You are talking about keeping kosher and other tenants of &quot;observant&quot; Judaism, and I will talk in those terms, though as Pam and others pointed out, it could certainly apply to other faiths.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour point about a child being allowed to mix meat and milk on paper plates, etc. not making the home un-kosher, is a good one, but how does your husband feel about that? I could imagine that that might just be too much to ask of him right now. Or that even if he could accept that, ham or shrimp on paper plates might be too much. If not, then great! But perhaps the child could be given permission to explore dietary choices  when visiting friends&#39; homes, shopping at the supermarket, etc. Maybe in this case your husband wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable being present for that, at least not right now, but would he be comfortable allowing you to facilitate it?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou described it as your &quot;husband&#39;s religion&quot;. Where do you fall in your level of observance and support of his, and how does he feel about that? Not a question you need to answer on list. It just jumped out at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a home where my parents practiced two different religions, and while my parents thought they were raising us to &quot;choose  for ourselves&quot; when we got older, my mother&#39;s obvious feeling about my father&#39;s religion never really left it being open as a true choice for us. As a result my Methodist mother doesn&#39;t have the Mormon children I guess she was afraid she&#39;d have; what she has is two  Jews (or one Jew and one raising Jewish children) and an atheist. Her judgement didn&#39;t attract me to her religion either, and as a religious seeker (some kids are, some kids aren&#39;t) I sought something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral people have commented since I started typing this response. I agree with Sandra re appropriate dress for synagogue. Her going should be the choice, not how she dresses when she&#39;s there. We are not Orthodox, but even so, my kids get that there are clothes that are appropriate for synagogue, weddings, parties, etc. and don&#39;t mind because I&#39;m not judging what they want to wear and they otherwise have free reign over what they wear when. Is your daughter asking to wear sleeveless tops and miniskirts to synagogue or otherwise? Or is this just something you can imagine might happen sometime in the future? Is there a way she can be creative with her dress and him still be comfortable that she&#39;s not dressing too immodestly?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other thought is that we all know kids that were raised within a restrictive religion that shed the tenants just as soon as they were old enough to get out from under their parents&#39; control. If your kids view keeping Kosher as a set of restrictions rather than a positive practice to help them feel connected to their religion, their ancestors, their community, they will not be as likely to keep Kosher when they are adults raising their own families. Same with going to services, keeping the Sabbath, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these are things that you and/or your husband find important and ideally want them to find important, too, then your best bet is to show them the joy in the religion, the holidays, the practices. Show them why it is important to you in your own life. They may or may not choose to be observant when they grow older, and you and/or your husband will have to figure out how to be ok with that. But a string of &quot;you can&#39;t eat that because it&#39;s not kosher,&quot; &quot;you can&#39;t do that because it&#39;s Shabbat&quot; etc. and mandating practice until they are 13/out of your house and then thinking it will suddenly have a positive meaning for them will likely backfire.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n(Joseph, 8; Hannah, 5; Miriam, 2 1/2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://campwolff.blogspot.com/\">http://campwolff.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Shira Rocklin &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-When beliefs relate to specific actions (moral<br/>\n&gt; veganism and not buying meat was mentioned in another thread) does this<br/>\n&gt; reality preclude taking unschooling and applying it to every area of<br/>\n&gt; life? -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think those people could adapt as much of unschooling as they could<br/>\n&gt; into that life, but they would be unlikely to get &quot;the same<br/>\n&gt; results&quot; (the array of benefits) as we discuss on this list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some could be way better than none, though!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I&#39;m going to be thinking about this for a very long time <br/>\n&gt; (considering my husbands commitment).  The religion itself is very <br/>\n&gt; flexible in many ways, for every question there are many many opinions <br/>\n&gt; one can follow.  And in some areas, the modern group of this religion, <br/>\n&gt; view the old answers as out-of-date (in terms of changes in mathematics, <br/>\n&gt; science, biology, etc).  I think there have been significant enough <br/>\n&gt; changes in how we believe children learn these days... the tradition <br/>\n&gt; says its okay to hit a child, but I&#39;ve yet to hear anyone of authority <br/>\n&gt; say that is right anymore.  I think I&#39;m going to hold out hope that it <br/>\n&gt; can be compatible with unschooling, and just keep doing what can be done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- There may be an onus on the father as head of the family to maintain<br/>\n&gt; those religious practices within his household. Bummer he married<br/>\n&gt; you! (joking... except for his fulfilling his religious duties :-) ---<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the traditional groups, definitely that is true.  I grew up with &#39;no <br/>\n&gt; unkosher food allowed into this house.&#39;  But in reality, a piece of <br/>\n&gt; unkosher food in the house is not going to make the kitchen become <br/>\n&gt; unkosher.  I&#39;m trying to imagine interesting scenarios.   If my child <br/>\n&gt; wanted to put cheese on their hamburger in our kosher kitchen...

The kids never rebelled against the <br/>\nway we do things in our house. I expected they&#39;d drink alcohol, and two <br/>\nof the three of them have done so or do so - but very little and rarely. <br/>\nBut they are discreet about it - they don&#39;t want to do it at home. I&#39;d <br/>\nthink if your kids wanted cheeseburgers, you could make sure they&#39;d have <br/>\nplenty of chance to have one outside the house and maybe they wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to even risk messing with your kosher kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had the same thing with more modest dress - my husband is from Iran <br/>\nand there were times we&#39;d be going to have dinner or visit friends or <br/>\nrelatives of his and we&#39;d ask the kids to dress appropriately for that. <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t act like other things they wanted to wear were bad, just that <br/>\nwe dressed differently for different occasions. That wasn&#39;t hard and we <br/>\nhad very few times that we ever even had it come up. The only big thing <br/>\nthat&#39;s ever happened was recently - Roya is 25 and getting married and, <br/>\nat first, we were thinking of having the wedding and reception at our <br/>\nhouse. But my husband and I do not want to serve alcohol at our house <br/>\nand they want to have alcohol at the reception. She was disappointed, <br/>\nbut we worked it out and we&#39;re having it in her backyard, but we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing a lot of work to fix it up and make it a beautiful location.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see unschooling as letting the kids do or have absolutely <br/>\neverything that they might possibly desire, at the expense of their <br/>\nparents&#39; feelings or interests. But there is always a sense of finding a <br/>\nway for things to work out for the kids, too, as opposed to parental <br/>\nabsolutes. I don&#39;t think a vegetarian parent has to eat meat because <br/>\ntheir kid wants to eat meat. But I think they should find a way for <br/>\ntheir kid to eat it, if that&#39;s what they want. If they can&#39;t bear to <br/>\nhave it in the house, then arrange for their kid to eat out a time or <br/>\ntwo a week. Find a way to support the kids&#39; interests. Usually small <br/>\nchildren of vegetarians don&#39;t complain or want meat in the house - but <br/>\nmight want a piece of pepperoni pizza when they&#39;re at Chuck E Cheese or <br/>\nsomething like that. So - that seems an easy way to support the kid <br/>\nwithout the parent having to fix or cook the meat. When they&#39;re older, <br/>\nthey can choose to eat meat at friends&#39; houses and when out of the house <br/>\nor make it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any unschooling vegetarians here are, in fact, having problems with <br/>\nkids really wanting their mom to buy and cook meat to eat at home, they <br/>\ncan speak up, but I have never heard of anybody having that problem. It <br/>\nhas always been the kids wanting to eat meat elsewhere and the parent <br/>\nhaving a problem with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat conflicts with unschooling is the parent wanting to have total <br/>\ncontrol over a kid and be completely unwilling to compromise or even try <br/>\nto find a way to support the child&#39;s interest. It is short-sighted on <br/>\nthe part of the parent to think they can control their kids for very <br/>\nlong, anyway. But, for a parent to want to have a kosher kitchen doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem unreasonable to me - what would be unreasonable would be to demand <br/>\nthat the kids keep kosher all the time, at home and outside the home.   <br/>\nAnd, if something like using paper plates for nonkosher foods works - <br/>\nthat&#39;s a great solution. What a wonderful example for your kids - being <br/>\ncreative about meeting their own interests while being very considerate <br/>\nof others&#39; interests.

Two people can live together and <br/>\nbelive different things.  But, the religion that my husband practices, <br/>\ndictates what kinds of foods he can eat, that he can&#39;t use electricity <br/>\non certain days, that he must pray at certain times, etc... and that he <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t aid in someone of the same religion (whether they believe in <br/>\nit or not) to do something counter to those rules (such as buying food <br/>\nfor that person which does not meet the religious dietary <br/>\nrequirements).   This seems like something more than a matter of <br/>\nmorality or faith.   When beliefs relate to specific actions (moral <br/>\nveganism and not buying meat was mentioned in another thread) does this <br/>\nreality preclude taking unschooling and applying it to every area of life? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to work it out in my head sometimes, but my logic hasn&#39;t <br/>\nresonated with my husband as of yet.

Those ideas aren&#39;t necessarily incompatible with unschooling. When they get in the way is when the parent&#39;s expression (of values, culture, etc) or the &quot;family identity&quot; override a child&#39;s interest in exploring other ideas about the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Principles vs. Covert Rules","postDate":"1279126567","msgId":56058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsM2pjZkRyU3NkMGdHS002bUNZemRRVDJ6QWZja2I3X2J2dzQyZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrNU9NU0FzQlpqYlVSNXJobF9yNWZNVUxxRy1Uel9qd21JNFFYTEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrNU9NU0FzQlpqYlVSNXJobF9yNWZNVUxxRy1Uel9qd21JNFFYTEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56055,"nextInTopic":56063,"prevInTime":56057,"nextInTime":56059,"topicId":56055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I forgot to post this link which is a compilation from lots of discussions over the years posted on Sandra s website about the difference between principles","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2030862677\">I forgot to post this link which is a compilation from lots of<br/>\ndiscussions over the years posted on Sandra&#39;s website about the<br/>\ndifference between principles and rules: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I especially found useful on that page:<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\nLogic and Parenting, by Joyce Fetteroll (&quot;If the reasons behind rules<br/>\nmake sense, then there isn&#39;t a reason to make a rule....If the reasons<br/>\nbehind rules are nonsense, then people memorize nonsense...&quot;)<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Principles vs. Covert Rules","postDate":"1279125807","msgId":56055,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrNU9NU0FzQlpqYlVSNXJobF9yNWZNVUxxRy1Uel9qd21JNFFYTEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56058,"prevInTime":56054,"nextInTime":56056,"topicId":56055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Why no one can honestly say whether some set of morals (vegetarianism, gun play prohibition, religion) are evil or good for unschooling.

Why<br/>\neach situation is different. Why the answer is almost always &quot;it<br/>\ndepends!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the question that  masks covert rules in a parent&#39;s thinking<br/>\nand, as Joyce Fetteroll mentioned, isn&#39;t the right question for<br/>\ngetting a good answer about unschooling: Can you simultaneously be a<br/>\ngood unschooler and stick to your moral of x, y or z?<br/>\n<br/>\nA better and more effective question to ask is: Does your moral trump<br/>\nthe relationship between parent and child? Knowing to ask such a<br/>\nquestion though probably makes asking it moot since the question<br/>\nitself is based on unschooling principles. People who aren&#39;t quite as<br/>\nclear on unschooling principles are going to end up in conversations<br/>\nlike the following from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rulebound:\">http://sandradodd.com/rulebound:</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************<br/>\n    The reason this conversation is really bothering me, is because<br/>\nSandra kept responding with other points that had nothing to do with<br/>\nmy one and only question. (Her points are GREAT ones, and ones I in<br/>\nfact agree with, but they are points about something other that my one<br/>\nquestion: Should I give my 4 & 7 year olds that particular game? She<br/>\nnever said Yes (and why) or NO (and why). You might ask yourself if<br/>\nyou were trying to have a conversation with someone and they were<br/>\nskipping over your particular question, and making lots of other<br/>\npoints that had nothing to do with what you were still trying to talk<br/>\nabout!!! I&#39;m not wound up and defensive and angry. Although I find<br/>\nmyself frustrated, and now on the defense trying to tell you (and<br/>\nSandra) that I agree with all those points she made, BUT IT&#39;S NOT WHAT<br/>\nI&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. That&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question like &quot;should I buy this, yes or no?&quot; isn&#39;t the kind of<br/>\nquestions others can answer very well. And if we did, we&#39;d need to say<br/>\nWHY we thought so, which would involve explaining a principle. And<br/>\nwith all of the best answers, it needs to start, &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we answer questions with &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; and give people what they<br/>\nclaim to want, or what they think they want, we are chucking fish out<br/>\ninstead of providing information on how to fish, how to make one&#39;s own<br/>\ncustom fishing equipment and when and where the fishing is great.<br/>\nUnschooling can&#39;t work as a series of yes/no questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother principle at work. Helping people learn to find their own<br/>\nanswers is vastly superior to distributing answers on demand. And<br/>\nthose who volunteer their time and experience are not willing to hold<br/>\nother&#39;s hands for years or months. They want to empower others.<br/>\nEmpowerment is a principle, not a rule. Learning to examine one&#39;s own<br/>\nlife and needs and beliefs is necessary for unschooling to work. When<br/>\npriorities and principles are coming clearer, such questions as<br/>\nwhether or not to buy a particular game or tool or movie or food are<br/>\nEASY, simple, happy questions. That&#39;s why the mom quoted above didn&#39;t<br/>\nget the simple straight answer she thought she needed. No one wanted<br/>\nto waste time or energy sending her down the wrong path.  ~~Sandra<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pivot on which such conversations hinge are unschooling<br/>\nprinciples. During my short bit on unschooling lists, the above has<br/>\nappeared over and over. Unschooling principles are a cornerstone for<br/>\ngetting unschooling. As noted, the above conversation took place in<br/>\n2004.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case anyone is wondering (because at one time I did wonder), here<br/>\nare essential UNSCHOOLING PRINCIPLES. I don&#39;t see the date written but<br/>\nit&#39;s been there a while because I read it a while back ... so Pam<br/>\nwrote these some time ago: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples are how something works. Unschooling principles are about<br/>\nhow learning works.<br/>\nRules are how someone outside something naturally occurring thinks it<br/>\nworks. As such it can be seen as an attempt to understand something<br/>\nthat occurs naturally on its own. Those who understand how something<br/>\nworks can support the working of it. That&#39;s where parents come into<br/>\nthe picture of how learning works; they facilitate the learning that&#39;s<br/>\nnaturally occurring in their children (and themselves too).<br/>\nAnother way to put it: Rules are external-- outside --naturally<br/>\noccurring things. Principles are already there at work within a<br/>\nnaturally occurring thing; they&#39;re inborn and integral to the thing<br/>\nitself.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Pam&#39;s list of principles, learning is ...<br/>\n<br/>\nContinuous<br/>\nUncoerced<br/>\nFun<br/>\nSelf-correcting<br/>\nEasy<br/>\nMeaningful<br/>\nIncidental<br/>\nConnected<br/>\nUnprovable<br/>\nNurtured<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56157,"nextTopicId":56130}}
