On October 12 at a Scout<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Master training Glen Schmidt, Dist. Comm. Chair was quoted as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;saying, &quot;I ask scouts during the training if they believe in god and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;if they don&#39;t I boot them out. In order for scouts to become good<br/>\n&gt;&gt;citizens they must believe in god.&quot;  Darrell responded to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;comment by saying, &quot; I am an atheist and no one in this room can<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rightfully say that I&#39;m not a good citizen. Mr. Schmidt you are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;discriminating against the 6% of Americans that don&#39;t believe. I got<br/>\n&gt;&gt;my Eagle award with my board knowing that I didn&#39;t believe in god.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;They don&#39;t discriminate.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Glen Schmidt, Dist. Comm. Chair then went on to say, &quot;Anybody that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t believe in god isn&#39;t a good citizen, and that if an atheist<br/>\n&gt;&gt;found a wallet on the ground they would pick it up plunder the money<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and throw the wallet back on the ground.&quot; Darrell&#39;s mother is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;scout leader and was told by another scout leader, Dave Jones, &quot;if<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you have any other boys in scouts that don&#39;t believe in god they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;need to be kicked out of scouts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In a phone conversation, Brad Farmer, Council Executive told<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Darrell that the BSA couldn&#39;t take his Eagle Award away because he<br/>\n&gt;&gt;already received it. He also told Darrell that because he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;believe in god he was not welcomed in scouts. In a conversation with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Toby Estes, District Executive the following day, Mr. Estes is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;quoted as saying, &quot;Darrell, scouting will be less without you, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it was the right thing to kick you out.&quot; He also said that &quot;It is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not discrimination it&#39;s policy. Scouts have been kicking atheists<br/>\n&gt;&gt;out for years and we are a private organization. Darrell it was also<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a mistake you received your Eagle Award.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;About Darrell  Lambert, Eagle Scout<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Darrell Lambert joined the Boy Scouts of America as a first year<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Webelos. He received his arrow of light and colors and went straight<br/>\n&gt;&gt;into troop 1531. There he participated as an assistant patrol leader<br/>\n&gt;&gt;from the day he started with the troop. Since then he had been a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;patrol leader, quartermaster, librarian, assistant senior patrol<br/>\n&gt;&gt;leader, den chief, JASM, senior patrol Leader twice, and patrol<br/>\n&gt;&gt;leader 2 other times. Darrell received his Eagle award in April of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2001. He joined explorer search and rescue in march of 1999 and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;earned a team leader certification a year and a half later. At the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;time Darrell was kicked out for being an atheist he was a field<br/>\n&gt;&gt;leader in training. He had been actively involved in leadership<br/>\n&gt;&gt;competitions through the FFA for his sophomore and junior years in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;high school.  He also raised pigs to show at fairs. He was an<br/>\n&gt;&gt;agriculture student his sophomore year. His senior year he had 777<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hours of community service time spent in athletic medicine class.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Darrell tied for state champion that year, and was the top senior.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Darrell also was a staff person at various weekend camps for trail<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of the eagle, and fall camporee, teaching scout skills, and merit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;badges. This Last June through September he went to fight Wildfires.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This is Darrell Lambert, 19 year old Eagle Scout who is considered<br/>\n&gt;&gt;by the Boy Scouts of America, not to be a good citizen because he is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;an atheist.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Steven Cozza, Eagle Scout &quot;I think it is horrible the Boy Scouts of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;America would kick out Darrell Lambert. He is more of an Eagle Scout<br/>\n&gt;&gt;then many Eagle Scouts who believe in god. Believing in god is not a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;measure of the quality of person. In fact the two murders of Matthew<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Shepard was an Eagle scout and a Mormon. The character of a person<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is seen by how a person lives his life. Apparently Mr. Farmer, Mr.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Schmidt, and Mr. Estes, lack the strength of character that Darrell<br/>\n&gt;&gt;has if they don&#39;t stand by him as the person they truly know he is.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sometimes rules that people follow are wrong. It would take the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;character of an Eagle Scout like Darrell Lambert to point that out.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;When will the Boy Scouts of America ever learn that their policy of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;discrimination is a violation of their own scout oath and law and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hurts kids? Businesses, individuals, and United Ways should stop<br/>\n&gt;&gt;funding an organization that discriminates against nontheists, gays,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and girls.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Other Contacts:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Darrell Lambert, Eagle Scout 360-895-6057<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Chief Seattle Council<br/>\n&gt;&gt;PO Box 440408,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Seattle, WA 98114-4408,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Phone (206) 725-5200, FAX (206)723-4330<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Brad Farmer, Council Scout Executive<br/>\n&gt;    Glen Schmidt, District Committee Chair<br/>\n&gt;    Toby Estes, District Scout Executive<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n--- StripMime Report -- processed MIME parts --- multipart/alternative<br/>\n  text/plain (text body -- kept)<br/>\n  text/html<br/>\n---<br/>\n_______________________________________________<br/>\nUU-Scouting mailing list<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UU-Scouting@...\">UU-Scouting@...</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uua.org/mailman/listinfo/uu-scouting\">http://www.uua.org/mailman/listinfo/uu-scouting</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!
