Like washing your car for 5 marks etc.  Some are there to cause <br/>\ntrouble, they will charge 5 marks and when the job is done they will say it <br/>\nwas 50 marks and get the MPs involved etc.  They will knock on doors and <br/>\nthings of that nature to find people and will basically harass you to get <br/>\nwork.  I have seen them go up to kids to try to get money.  I would hesitate <br/>\nabout leaving children alone in a military housing area unless it is closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I understand what you are saying, It would be nice to have a little <br/>\nmore room to make parental decisions on the issue.  I never ran into that as <br/>\nmy boys were born in Germany but were 3 and 6 months when we left.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway good luck on changing the regulation.

I realize that I&#39;m more visable because of being a<br/>\nfoster parent for the army.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do see the Army&#39;s point (and yours, Pam) about the Army sponsoring us in a<br/>\nforeign country, etc.  But the vast majority of the problems come from the<br/>\nenlisted soldiers, not unsupervised-for-15-minutes 9 and 10 year old<br/>\nchildren!  The point I&#39;ve been trying to make to the army is that when they<br/>\nwrite a regulation like that (NO unsupervised time before 11 years, period),<br/>\nthey set kids up for failure.  Children need chances to learn and build<br/>\ntrust with their parents.  Turning 11 years old does NOT guarantee you know<br/>\nanything about staying alone for 3 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been asking the army to re-write the regulations in a way that would<br/>\nacknowledge that while a child under a certain age (5 and under?) should<br/>\nnever be left alone, and that an older child (under 11, if they like)<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be left alone for hours, possibly the children in the middle<br/>\n(6-10?) could be left alone for 15-30 minutes, WITH parental discretion.  We<br/>\nknow our kids, and we also know we&#39;re responsible for their actions here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people I talk to (and I have tallked to a lot of people here about this<br/>\nissue) say it&#39;s not the long trips that irritate their kids, the kids<br/>\nunderstand those.  It&#39;s when you need to run over to the little shop 2<br/>\nblocks away and grab some milk and bread, or go to a friend&#39;s apartment on<br/>\nthe other side of the road but out of sight for 10 minutes, drive another<br/>\nchild to an activity, etc.  The kind of trips you&#39;d make in the states and<br/>\npossibly not have to think twice about, but living in housing, we have to<br/>\nweigh the possibility that some nosy neighbor with nothing better to do<br/>\nwould report you for leaving your kids alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my son gets older, I understand why so many people *don&#39;t* &quot;behave&quot;,<br/>\nbecause they trust their children and want to give them opportunity to be<br/>\ntrustworthy.  But they live in fear of the Army&#39;s social services people,<br/>\nand that&#39;s just wrong.
