I thought it was pretty positive.  And <br/>\nboth education professors interviewed were positive about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=1037\">http://cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=1037</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my quotes got a little mangled though.  She wrote:  &#39;<br/>\n&quot;Every once in awhile I get a bug in my head saying, &#39;Gosh, I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I know that this is out there in the world,&#39;&quot; Tellew said. &quot;I <br/>\nstarted telling them about math and they didn&#39;t really care. Pushing <br/>\nthat kind of stuff is what gives people that resistance.&quot; She would <br/>\nrather her children follow something that excites them. &#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I said was, &quot;Every once in a while, I get a little bug in my <br/>\nhead saying, &#39;Gosh, I don&#39;t think they (my kids) know that this is <br/>\nout there in the world.&#39;  Then I told her about how I&#39;d recently been <br/>\non a little math jag of my own, learning about Fibonacci numbers for <br/>\nthe first time, and when I showed my kids they weren&#39;t interested at <br/>\nthe time, so I dropped it.  My son thought the way it was written <br/>\nmade them sound anti math, which they aren&#39;t, just busy with <br/>\nsomething else they cared more about at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and it wasn&#39;t exactly an unschooling camp-out where she <br/>\ninterviewed people but there were lots of unschoolers there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut overall, a pretty good article.
