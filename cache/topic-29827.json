Thanks. Some things I asked <br/>\nabout our 18 (almost 19) year old pays for already (gas, guitar-<br/>\nrelated gear, entertainment - meaning eating out with his friends, <br/>\ndating, movies, etc.), but I was interested to know where everyone <br/>\nelse stood on them. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther info about our situation is that he just graduated from high <br/>\nschool in June, is working full-time, and does not plan to attend <br/>\ncollege. He received about $10,000 cash as gifts from family & <br/>\nfriends for his graduation, which he used to buy a car (since the one <br/>\nwe gave him died about a month before graduation), and a new guitar <br/>\namp. He still has some in his account. We asked him to start paying <br/>\nfor his own car insurance with his new car, but were able to get him <br/>\nan incredible deal by putting the car in my husband&#39;s name and adding <br/>\nit to our policy with our son as the primary driver. He pays about <br/>\n1/3rd of what his friends pay, and he has better insurance. He&#39;s <br/>\nhappy with that arrangement.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer he and I did a little budget for him that included <br/>\ncalculating how much gas it cost to go from an apartment of his <br/>\nchoice to work/church/guitar lessons/downtown/etc. and it was a real <br/>\neye-opener for him. He decided then and there that he would just <br/>\ncontinue living with us for a while. Fair enough. I told him he was <br/>\nalways welcome in our home, and that he could stay as long as he <br/>\nwanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I had been thinking was that in the fall we might sit down with <br/>\nhim and talk about handing over some of his other bills that he will <br/>\ntake with him when he moves out (guitar lessons, health insurance), <br/>\nbut not go so far as to charge him rent or board (things he would not <br/>\ntake with him).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I can see now is that my negative feelings about my late <br/>\ntransition into financial responsibility for myself have more to do <br/>\nwith the strings that always came attached to the money my parents <br/>\nprovided for me. Their money meant their control over me, and it <br/>\nstill bothers me even now to think about how it was. Even though we <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that to our kids, I guess I have been thinking (heavily <br/>\nladen with my own baggage) that surely our 18 year old would want <br/>\nmore independence from us by paying his own bills. Thanks for opening <br/>\nmy eyes to that. I&#39;ve decided to just leave everything the way it is <br/>\nfor now. If we&#39;re still in the same spot in a couple of years, <br/>\nthough, we&#39;ll have to talk. :)  (I can&#39;t really see that happening. <br/>\nThings always change.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChelsea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Children staying home...a ?","postDate":"1184380526","msgId":29869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwNzEzMTkzNXc2ODAzMDRjY2hlZDVhNTdiMGUzOWNjYWYzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY3OGFoOCtzYXF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENCNjU4MUVFLUY1QzQtNEYxNC1CRTc1LTg2QkM4MzYyRUVGMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxmNzhhaDgrc2FxdEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29864,"nextInTopic":29874,"prevInTime":29868,"nextInTime":29870,"topicId":29827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- So, I just wanted to add that I am 36 and my Mom currently pays my car insurance.

He had a discount, then, on the gaming supplies he  <br/>\nwas already buying with his allowance before that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose we could have penalized him by taking some of that money  <br/>\naway, but he was learning and thriving, and that was part of our goal  <br/>\nand desire for him, so we kept feeding and housing and clothing him,  <br/>\njust as we would have if he had been in school or unemployeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was offered a job at 15, working for a man who made boots and  <br/>\npouches of leather, for re-enactors and historical reproduction  <br/>\nthis&#39;n&#39;that.  Marty learned LOTS, and lots.  And he was being paid.   <br/>\nHe was making money learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose we could have taken some of that money away, but darned if  <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t start paying for his insurance so he could drive himself to  <br/>\nwork.   And then, darned if he didn&#39;t often prefer to go up the bike  <br/>\ntrail on his roller blades instead of driving (though sometimes he  <br/>\ntook the bus back, because it was uphill and he was tired after work,  <br/>\nand darned if I didn&#39;t always make sure he had quarters in his pocket  <br/>\nfor the bus).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way it works at our house is that all our kids have earned money,  <br/>\nand they go out to eat, buy games, go to movies with it, and treat  <br/>\ntheir friends if their friends are  poorer.  When they were younger  <br/>\nand poorer, older or richer friends often paid for movies or meals or  <br/>\narcade play for them, and it flows back.  Marty saves more than Kirby  <br/>\ndoes.   Kirby makes more than Marty made when Marty was last working,  <br/>\nbut Marty saved thousands of dollars and used some of it to go to  <br/>\nOregon and Washington.  Holly saved hundreds of dollars from a  <br/>\nbabysitting job and used some of it to go on a trip to visit friends  <br/>\nin Rhode Island (she paid her airfare and took her own spending  <br/>\nmoney, of her own choice).  Some of it she used to go to a big music  <br/>\nconcert yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext month we&#39;re paying for Marty and Holly to go to an unschooling  <br/>\nconference across the country.

It&#39;s a little less if  <br/>\nthey speed, which Marty did, unfortunately, and he wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>\ngotten a ticket if Keith had signed the registration.  So Keith will  <br/>\nprobably pay that ticket, because the police officer said she  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve given Marty a warning only, but the unsigned registration  <br/>\ntipped the balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the story I started to tell, but I think it counts, here.   <br/>\nI knew that story because I called to see how Holly was.  They were  <br/>\nin the town but not at the concert yet, when I called.  I heard  <br/>\nseveral stories, and the four people there (Holly&#39;s 13 year old  <br/>\nfriend and Marty&#39;s 22 year old friend, too; Sadie, a friend of the  <br/>\nwhole family)...  the four were laughing and joking, and Holly did  <br/>\nfeel better.  She&#39;s been feverish and sore-throatish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nAnyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point they were planning to stay overnight, when we thought  <br/>\nthe concert would end late.  I offered to pay all or some of the cost  <br/>\nof the motel room.  The two older kids (who are going because Holly  <br/>\nwanted to see Cute is What We Aim For and wanted to be taken there)  <br/>\nsaid they could cover it.  Holly said she would put in up to a half,  <br/>\nfor her and her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could have taken my money, but they didn&#39;t.  I gave Marty my  <br/>\ndebit card and said to use it in case of emergency or car repair need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore they left, we were up and Kirby hadn&#39;t gone to sleep yet (they  <br/>\ngot up at 6:00 to leave at 7:00, and Kirby works until 3:00 a.m.).   <br/>\nHe and Marty and I were talking about what video game systems he&#39;s  <br/>\ntalking with him when he moves in August.   He&#39;s leaving the X-Box,  <br/>\nwhich he and Marty bought together.  He&#39;s taking the original  <br/>\nPlaystation, which Marty bought with his own money.  Marty has a  <br/>\nPlaystation 2, also, so doesn&#39;t mind Kirby taking the older one.    <br/>\nKirby will take the Wii, which he bought himself, and some of the  <br/>\ngame cube games (which they told me will play on the Wii).  There was  <br/>\nno unhappiness and no arguing in the whole conversation.  It was very  <br/>\nfriendly and pleasant, and I was impressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n From my own childhood I remember lots of resentment, argument,  <br/>\ncrying, deprivation, parents telling kids to shut up, kids telling  <br/>\nother kids &quot;It&#39;s not fair...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing generous with our kids seems to have made us generous.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly bought all the tickets with money she made babysitting, last  <br/>\nspring.   The two older kids paid her back.  The mom of the other  <br/>\ngirl said she/mom wasn&#39;t going to pay for this concert, the girl  <br/>\nwould have to.  The girl babysits lots, but doesn&#39;t get paid.  The  <br/>\ntickets were $37.50.  Meals are, say $5 each.  Part of a motel would  <br/>\nbe $15 to $25.  Gasoline?  Marty will probably just pay for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girl&#39;s mom gave her $20.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing this wasn&#39;t going to be forthcoming from the other family, an  <br/>\nadult friend of all involved gave Holly the price of that concert  <br/>\nticket as a birthday gift to the other girl.  I don&#39;t know if the  <br/>\nother mom knows.   The girl got $50 for her birthday, and her mom  <br/>\ntold her she could not take it to the concert, but had to spend it on  <br/>\nclothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll around us my kids see other families handle money in arbitrary  <br/>\nand seemingly vindictive ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see the good results of avoiding those bad decisions (or those bad  <br/>\nfollow-the-crowd lack-of-thought &quot;decisions&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Children staying home...a ?","postDate":"1184267538","msgId":29832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3NXVlaStkMTBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY3NWtkMys5a2I4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29830,"nextInTopic":29834,"prevInTime":29831,"nextInTime":29833,"topicId":29827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
