What belongs  <br/>\nto the restaurant isn&#39;t free to be played with, but what parents  <br/>\nbring is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible for kids to be too young and rambunctious for staid- <br/>\nkinds-of public places.  If a parent whose kids NEEDS to touch and  <br/>\nrun goes to a tablecloth restaurant instead of a Burger King with a  <br/>\nplayground, that&#39;s a parental misjudgment.  IF a parent doesn&#39;t take  <br/>\nthings for the child to do and play with, that&#39;s a failure on the  <br/>\npart of the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a chlld wants to play with sugar cubes, buy a box on the way  <br/>\nhome!  There are cool things to do with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child wants to play with silverware (more than the few settings  <br/>\naround him) bring all yours out at the house.  Practice launching  <br/>\nforks, or making triangles with table knives or seeing your face in  <br/>\ndifferent spoons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everything a child wants to do is okay, not when it involves  <br/>\nother people&#39;s stuff, space, and privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one of our kids left a mess, I left a bigger tip to help  <br/>\ncompensate for it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288045205,"authorName":"Joanne O&#39;N.","from":"&quot;Joanne O&#39;N.&quot; &lt;seagullcaller@...&gt;","profile":"seagullcaller","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Silverware example","postDate":"1178382377","msgId":28633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxaWI3OStjb2ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYxZ28yYytidTQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28613,"nextInTopic":28634,"prevInTime":28632,"nextInTime":28634,"topicId":28609,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The link was very helpful with concrete suggestions for how to communicate well as the parent.
