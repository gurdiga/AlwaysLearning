I have to say<br/>\nthat sometimes I get tired of talking about (gasp)<br/>\nunschooling/homeschooling. That seems silly to say when I am on a list<br/>\nabout it. I don&#39;t mean chatting about expanding existing things or how to<br/>\nhandle things that can crop up with people who share your own basic<br/>\nbeliefs. What I mean is so often having to explain what you do to people<br/>\nwho are skeptical. Support groups and people new to hs always want to talk<br/>\nto those who have been in this for a few years. I know that&#39;s<br/>\nunderstandable and I can remember appreciating the people who talked to me<br/>\nbut just sometimes I get tired of having to defend or provide rationale for<br/>\nthe way we live.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course when you nurse an older kid you get used to explanations:)<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; Bringing up a nice interesting issue here would also work for me. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t anybody look to me.
