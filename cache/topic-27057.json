I have spent<br/>\nseveral months giving some books away to friends and I have donated many<br/>\nboxes of books to charity. I went through the remaining boxes and pulled out<br/>\nbooks, and a few personal possessions, that are either hard to find or were<br/>\nannotated, marked or signed by John Holt. There are also several books<br/>\nsigned by their authors to John Holt, often first editions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf special interest to friends and scholars of Holt, there are some<br/>\ninstances where books contain pieces of paper or bent corners that John used<br/>\nto mark passages and they have remained in place since his death. Some books<br/>\ncontain Holt¹s notes and comments on the text, as well. All these books<br/>\nprovide provocative clues into the mind of one of the most original<br/>\neducators of the twentieth century. As homeschooling continues to grow,<br/>\ninterest in Holt has too. John Holt&#39;s interests and reading cover the gamut<br/>\nfrom alternative energy to child care; politics to poetry; cartoons to<br/>\norganic farming. Own a piece of educational and cultural history from the<br/>\nprevious century as well as get a physical connection to John Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit eBay and search for &quot;Items for Sale by plf139&quot; or just click on this<br/>\nlink to see the first batch of items I&#39;ve posted:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZplf139QQhtZ-1\">http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZplf139QQhtZ-1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be posting new items as I can until everything is gone.
