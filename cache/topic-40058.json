From the very first week of school my oldest child had <br/>\ntrouble with his fourth grade teacher.  After attempts to remedy the <br/>\nsituation with the teacher/my co-worker, I finally came to the <br/>\nrealization that her philosophy of education and mine were not <br/>\ncompatible, and my son was caught in the middle.  I talked the <br/>\nsituation over with a friend of mine.  She sent me a copy of the lyrics <br/>\nfor Harry Chapin&#39;s &quot;Flowers are Red.&quot;  I turned in my resignation the <br/>\nnext day.  It is interesting to note that this particular friend was <br/>\nunschooling her older daughter while her younger daughter was a student <br/>\nin my class.  Her younger daughter&#39;s last day of school was the day <br/>\nbefore mine. She knew when she sent that e-mail what conclusion I would <br/>\ncome to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as the song implies, I am still trying to undo the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina (I posted the lyrics below for those who don&#39;t know the song)<br/>\n<br/>\nFlowers are Red <br/>\nby Harry Chapin <br/>\n<br/>\nThe little boy went first day of school<br/>\nHe got some crayons and started to draw<br/>\nHe put colors all over the paper<br/>\nFor colors was what he saw<br/>\nAnd the teacher said..
