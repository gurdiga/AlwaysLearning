Get a feeling for how the list works.  IDEAS are discussed on this<br/>\nand many other unschooling lists.  Most aren&#39;t considered support groups but<br/>\ndiscussion groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nReally, no one was attacking you.  They were just trying to get you to<br/>\nexamine your thoughts and ideas a little more closely.  Like when you word<br/>\nsomething with the words &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, (about going outside in the winter)<br/>\nsomeone (me in this case) might point out that everything in life is a<br/>\nchoice and that&#39;s a better way to think about it.  If you think of having<br/>\nlimited choices, then you will limit yourself.  The world is wide open and<br/>\neverything is a choice.  So instead of saying, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;   it would be more<br/>\naccurate to say, &quot;I choose not to&quot; or to just give more details about why<br/>\ngoing outside doesn&#39;t work for you at this point.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to get outside with little ones but for me it was important.<br/>\nThere are a variety of ways to keep a little child&#39;s hands warm.  Maybe put<br/>\nlong warm socks on over his hands before you put his coat on, ones that go<br/>\nall the way up his arms.  Maybe invest in some 99 cent hand warmers for him<br/>\nto hold.  Maybe he would like to hold a warm rice bag.  Maybe if your dd<br/>\nfound an activity that she likes outside, she&#39;d be more willing to go<br/>\noutside.  These lists are great for brainstorming ideas.  I am not saying<br/>\ntake a very unwilling child kicking and screaming out into the cold if she<br/>\nreally protests, but maybe there are specific things that will help her to<br/>\nenjoy being outside, if its something that is important to you.  For me,<br/>\ngoing outside always broke up the monotony, even if it was just for a short<br/>\ntime.  It refreshed me and helped me to be a more patient mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am so thankful that ideas are discussed on these lists.  They have helped<br/>\nme grow immensely and to become a better parent.  Maybe they&#39;ll help you<br/>\ntoo, if you stick around.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163531329,"authorName":"heasue2003","from":"&quot;heasue2003&quot; &lt;heasue2003@...&gt;","profile":"heasue2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I don&#39;t tolerate intolerance","postDate":"1106026337","msgId":21601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNzaTcxMStkZmVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21605,"prevInTime":21600,"nextInTime":21602,"topicId":21601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not perfect.
