It&#39;s another topic. I might not be considered up on this topic because<br/>\nI have one child only. However, we still deal with the above when one or<br/>\nmore of us 3 (counting both me, Karl and his dad together) want to stay and<br/>\none wants to leave or vice versa. I bring a book, knitting or drawing stuff<br/>\nto do, Karl brings his DS, or a newish or interesting toy he wants to play<br/>\nwith (or usually both) and Brian is seldom at lose ends when there&#39;s someone<br/>\nto talk with about cars or oil or something like that.  That helps a lot.<br/>\nAnd actually it happens quite a bit since we live in a very rural area and<br/>\nanywhere very far means one or more of us might end up being &quot;stuck&quot; with<br/>\nnothing to do for a while unless we plan for the possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Feb 11, 2010 at 11:27 AM, Kristi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:foehn_jye@...\">foehn_jye@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My oldest is exactly the same way, whether it is gymnastics or choir or<br/>\n&gt; anything else that she totally loves.

If we leave, we<br/>\n&gt; can go to the park, or get hot chocolate, or whatever, since we&#39;re already<br/>\n&gt; out.
