I hope I&#39;m making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes sense to me.   Unschooling works best when the children&#39;s learning <br/>\nisn&#39;t limited (in the parents&#39; mind) to school subjects.  That&#39;s a big given, <br/>\nmost of us would probably say, but there are lots of people who want to say <br/>\nunschooling is nothing more than not using a curriculum.  And I think they&#39;re <br/>\nright, at a basic definition level.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone takes that definition home and says &quot;Now I am an unschooler,&quot; and <br/>\nsimply lives in the absence of a curriculum, without changing any behaviors or <br/>\nphilosophies or expectations, I dont think it will be long before he&#39;s trying <br/>\nunit studies, or looking for a curriculum, or putting the kids back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds.<br/>\nIt&#39;s simple, but not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there are people who don&#39;t want to be disturbed by too much detailed <br/>\nrecommendation on life changes.  And that&#39;s fine.   I don&#39;t make a commission <br/>\nwhen someone decides to unschool or anything. My own kids are very happy and <br/>\nwhole.  I didn&#39;t need others to give me permission to do what I did, past the <br/>\nlegal options which were pretty wonderful to have!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn May there were problems on a list Home Education Magazine sponsored, and <br/>\nthree or four of the main writers there went off to form their own list for <br/>\nbeginners.  I wasn&#39;t on either list (Unschooling101 or UnschoolingBasics), but in <br/>\nthe discussions of the weekend, I predicted that either unschooling.com was <br/>\ngoing to be shut down or that I would lose my column.<br/>\n<br/>\nA week later I received a short note from Helen Hegener saying she was <br/>\ndropping my column.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know until the July issue arrived whether I would be in that one.

Some are more radical than<br/>\nothers.  I think there is a place for all of them.  I liken it to<br/>\nChristianity.  All the different churches believe in the same general<br/>\nphilosophy, but what it means to them differs from church to church.  Some<br/>\nunschooling lists have a broader view of what unschooling is and lots of<br/>\npeople feel comfortable in that setting. Not often is someone told they<br/>\naren&#39;t unschooling, although they might offer alternatives to what is not<br/>\nworking or ways to lighten up and follow their children&#39;s lead.  Other lists<br/>\nare more radical and included in the discussion are the more radical<br/>\nparenting ideas.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have been on different unschooling lists for almost 4 years, I think.<br/>\n(feels longer) At different times I&#39;ve gotten more benefit out of different<br/>\nlists.  I&#39;ve joined this list off and on over the last couple years and each<br/>\ntime that I left I left with an issue to work through.  (TV, setting own<br/>\nbedtimes, other parenting issues)  Things I&#39;ve read here have made me<br/>\nuncomfortable at times precisely because they challenged my thinking.  I<br/>\nhave grown more from the more radical lists than from any other lists.  That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t lessen the value of the other lists.  They served their purpose.<br/>\nTwo different lists particularly helped me through those times when I<br/>\nstarted to panic and lose my confidence in the process of learning. I needed<br/>\ntheir gentleness at that time, I think.  But now, I need the directness of<br/>\nthis list.

People have told her it&#39;s life changing for them. (And others have said<br/>\nhow mean everyone is too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that in order to get that life, people need to let go of<br/>\ncertain conventions and thoughts. But not everyone is willing to let go of<br/>\nso much to get that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping people let go involves defining what is and isn&#39;t unschooling. But<br/>\nHelen doesn&#39;t want to define unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what Helen wants is to define (without actually spelling it out)<br/>\nunschooling as learning by living and to create a place where anyone who is<br/>\ndrawn to the idea can get together and share their journeys. She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to impose her definition on people. She wants them to come to their own<br/>\ndefinition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the idea -- but with a lot of caveats. ;-) I think lots of<br/>\nfamilies could benefit from understanding and seeing in action that kids<br/>\nlearn by living, even if the parents couldn&#39;t fully let go. Best is everyone<br/>\nradically unschooling :-) But that&#39;s not going to happen! Better could be<br/>\nmore people letting go of as many schoolish concepts of learning as they&#39;re<br/>\ncomfortable with -- as Pat Farenga defines unschooling -- because they can<br/>\nsee people who are letting go of all of that and kids still learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think UnschoolingDiscussion, AlwaysLearning and unschoolingbasics (and<br/>\nperhaps others I don&#39;t know about) offer that information. *But*, as a side<br/>\neffect, the comraderie on the lists tends to be limited to radical<br/>\nunschoolers which means others who like some of the ideas can feel excluded.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Not intentionally. It&#39;s just a natural side effect of any group that&#39;s<br/>\ndrawn together around an idea. If someone is drawn to the comraderie of the<br/>\ngroup but not to the idea, they&#39;re going to feel excluded when it&#39;s pointed<br/>\nout that they haven&#39;t embraced the idea that&#39;s drawn the group together.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I agree with the concept of creating a place for people to hang out who<br/>\nare drawn to some of the ideas of unschooling. The flaw, though, is that<br/>\nwithout a group that&#39;s actively at the radical end, showing people how far<br/>\nit&#39;s possible to go, the group will tend towards choices based on comforting<br/>\nfears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought the set up at AOL was great. There were folders for all styles. It<br/>\nfelt like one big community without having to interact with everyone in the<br/>\ncommunity. People could &quot;go elsewhere&quot; (a different place under the same<br/>\nroof) when advice didn&#39;t suit them without having to &quot;go elsewhere&quot; (out<br/>\ninto the big world of 10,000 unfamiliar doors to choose from) :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I wonder if I were starting out today if I&#39;d find unschooling. I started<br/>\nout so far away and there&#39;s so much information available now that I would<br/>\nthink it&#39;s hard to sample a bit of everything. Investigating just one aspect<br/>\nof homeschooling could feel like a full time committment!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally there could be something similar for &quot;unschooling&quot; (defining it<br/>\nbroader than here). There could be a Radical Unschooling folder and then<br/>\nother folders for other definitions of unschooling. That way people could<br/>\nchoose without feeling it&#39;s radical or nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* have zero interest in creating a place like that. ;-) But I would like<br/>\nto see radical unschooling ideas out there for people to sample easily to<br/>\ngive another avenue for the idea that there&#39;s something other than<br/>\ncontrol/neglect to trickle out along into mainstream society.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the nature of unschooling, & &quot;HEM without Sandra?&quot;","postDate":"1093396249","msgId":20483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZS4yOWEzMmE5MC4yZTVkNDExOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20466,"nextInTopic":20505,"prevInTime":20482,"nextInTime":20484,"topicId":20449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/24/04 1:20:43 PM, nellebelle@charter.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279414349\">In a message dated 8/24/04 1:20:43 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It seems to me they are trying to say that anything that is NOT attending <br/>\npublic school IS unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not attending to sign up with a program that does your reporting and <br/>\ngives you $1500 or something.

I hope I&#39;m making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes sense to me.   Unschooling works best when the children&#39;s learning <br/>\nisn&#39;t limited (in the parents&#39; mind) to school subjects.  That&#39;s a big given, <br/>\nmost of us would probably say, but there are lots of people who want to say <br/>\nunschooling is nothing more than not using a curriculum.  And I think they&#39;re <br/>\nright, at a basic definition level.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone takes that definition home and says &quot;Now I am an unschooler,&quot; and <br/>\nsimply lives in the absence of a curriculum, without changing any behaviors or <br/>\nphilosophies or expectations, I dont think it will be long before he&#39;s trying <br/>\nunit studies, or looking for a curriculum, or putting the kids back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds.<br/>\nIt&#39;s simple, but not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there are people who don&#39;t want to be disturbed by too much detailed <br/>\nrecommendation on life changes.  And that&#39;s fine.   I don&#39;t make a commission <br/>\nwhen someone decides to unschool or anything. My own kids are very happy and <br/>\nwhole.
