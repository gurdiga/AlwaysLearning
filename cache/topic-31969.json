I got it at Borders, and it&#39;s the sort of flash card-ish thing <br/>\nthat should be easy to find. Your goal is to get 5 states that touch <br/>\neach other in some way. Each state card also shows the state bird and <br/>\nflower. There&#39;s not a lot of depth to it but is quick fun and <br/>\nportable. I will be totally honest and admit that only Mom and Dad <br/>\nhave played so far, since our baby is too little, but I think I would <br/>\nhave liked it.

Her other book is Grandpa  <br/>\nGazillion&#39;s Number Yard (or something close to that).  I think it&#39;s a  <br/>\nmatching concept, and has nicknames, but not sure if it&#39;s got more  <br/>\ninfo than that on the cards.  It says &quot;whimsical, mad-dashing  <br/>\ngeography game&quot; on the cover, so it&#39;s probably more geared toward fun  <br/>\nand high level state shape recognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, we&#39;ve printed out mapquest maps of our routine trip from  <br/>\nChicago to Iowa, and the kids are always eager to see how close we  <br/>\nare to the Mississippi River, and we note the cities and landmarks  <br/>\nalong the way.  Probably anything you do can be Mapquested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about Google Earth?  It&#39;s kind of another interesting way to  <br/>\norient to things.  We have a friend from Poland who we were recently  <br/>\ntrying to see if we could find her town, and it&#39;s just kind of cool  <br/>\nto see how Google Earth jumps from your town up into the sky and  <br/>\naround the globe to another place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also just pick up the globe all the time, when we are talking about  <br/>\nanything that is not where we are.  It&#39;s low-tech and not a game, but  <br/>\nit floats around our house from place to place, and gets picked up  <br/>\nand referenced when it makes sense (I&#39;m actually quite horrible at  <br/>\ngeography); just recently we were playing Pirates of the Caribbean&#39;s  <br/>\nonline game, and looking at the Caribbean.  So many things come up in  <br/>\nconversation now, with a 9, 6 and 3yo, that we can often trace  <br/>\nsomething across the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 5, 2008, at 7:27 AM, beanmommy2 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have any recommendations for good geography-like games or<br/>\n&gt; activities or puzzles?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Store-bought, on-line, homemade, whatever ...
