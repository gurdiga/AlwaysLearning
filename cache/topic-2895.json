This was very difficult for me, but I was young and thought everyone else knew what they were talking about. My son is now 6 and back in bed with us at his request. I am sure he feels safe again because he goes to sleep with the sweetest grin on his face every night as I sing to him.  My deepest desire is that this will magically erase what I feel was a major trauma of his infancy.  I wish I would have known.
