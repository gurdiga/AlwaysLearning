When each of the kids have<br/>\ngone through a name-calling thing, they have been resistant and angry<br/>\nat us trying to shift the energy away from the &quot;heaviness of a word&quot;<br/>\nbecause they have had strong feelings that caused the word in the<br/>\nfirst place.  I just wanted to add this in because my son, in<br/>\nparticular, has felt trivialized by this technique, and while it may<br/>\nwork for many kids, it doesn&#39;t work for all.  Or maybe it just really<br/>\ndepends on what has inspired the name calling in the first<br/>\nplace--whether it is coming from a more playful place or a more angry<br/>\nplace.  But it&#39;s definitely not a one size fits all way to approach<br/>\nname calling. &#92;&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nthis made me think abit more ...I agree, there is never a one size<br/>\nfits all approach for just about everything...every child, every<br/>\nsituation is different. And so are ages to be accounted for. I too,<br/>\nfound that with one of my children, dd2 lidia who is now 17 was never<br/>\none for humor when angry...she wanted and wants to take it all very<br/>\nseriously.  And for my sixth child, Leo, who is 5y, when he was almost<br/>\n3 he would slip into the play for a minute and then bang into his<br/>\nforgotten anger doubletime. He is not like that anymore, and I<br/>\nattribute this mostly to really concentrating on connection fully<br/>\ninbetween angry moments as well as the fact he is much more able to<br/>\nverbalise. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is very angry and is using strong language, I would never<br/>\ndream of turning the energy to playfulness.  There is anger to deal<br/>\nwith first.  What I understood was a situation where a child (like a<br/>\nsmall child under 5y)is trying out words or actions heard or seen<br/>\noutside the home or from visitors to the home, to see how they might<br/>\nbe used.  I did not realise that we might be talking about an older<br/>\nchild using them to express strong emotions.  This is definitely a<br/>\ndifferent sort of situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our family, often my younger children will start a bickering &quot;youre<br/>\ndumb&quot; &quot;no Im not you are,&quot; sort of back and forth...and often if left<br/>\nalone it can lead to bigger issues but since I have started jumping in<br/>\nwith a &quot;hey, but *I* am even dumber&quot; or &quot;Youre dumb Im dumb, we&#39;re all<br/>\ndumb together!&quot; many times my 5 yo leo will banter on his own, &quot;yeah <br/>\nIm dumb, so are you, mommas dumb too!&quot; (like big deal, you figured<br/>\nthat one out, so what already??) --this made us all laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nmelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"Joanna &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Fwd:  Re: Name calling, what to do","postDate":"1213982979","msgId":35592,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwRjYyMTlGLTAxMUEtMTAwMC1BQzEzLTJEMDEzQjA2MThDMi1XZWJtYWlsLTEwMDE2QG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35593,"prevInTime":35591,"nextInTime":35593,"topicId":35592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If he does end up laughing, he will then redouble and become even more furious that someone tried to distract him from his anger.  We figured this out pretty quickly, but it is something that has happened a lot with family friends.  He wants to be heard and then move on when he&#39;s ready, not humored out of his feelings.  We&#39;ve found that our younger daughter is more receptive to being emotionally &quot;distracted,&quot; and will more often appreciate the opportunity to change &quot;tempos.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35536,"nextTopicId":35612}}
