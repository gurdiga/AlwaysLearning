She&#39;d<br/>\nbe snooping and scooping for info and taking traces of info, and we&#39;d do<br/>\na bit of research together to find out more info on someone.  Since, we<br/>\ndid it, she knew what kind of info might be too much info.

In fact, there really aren&#39;t many psycho killers out there in the<br/>\nworld, except in TV and movie land.

Everyone has been who they said they<br/>\nwere.  Chamille wouldn&#39;t even know her boyfriend if it weren&#39;t for the<br/>\ninternet, since she met his best friend online in Gaia over a year ago<br/>\nand has been talking to him through myspace all this time.  They were<br/>\nvirtual internet strangers, yet they became friends and ended up meeting<br/>\neach other in another weird connected coincidental way.  We live very<br/>\nclose to all of them.  They live close enough to skateboard to our<br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharing personal info isn&#39;t an all or nothing thing either.  It&#39;s a case<br/>\nby case thing, and a get a feel for it thing, and a talk to your parents<br/>\nand keep communication open kind of thing.  Chamille isn&#39;t afraid to say<br/>\nto me, &quot;hey mom, I met someone online and I want to meet them in real<br/>\nlife, help me set it up.&quot;  And, I do.  Chamille has plenty of friends<br/>\nwho&#39;s parents are completely freaked out about internet stranger danger<br/>\nand give a blanket &quot;no&quot; for all internet strangers.

I will think about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, we had more rules around here, mainly of <br/>\nthe, &quot;if you took it out, put it back away&quot; variety.<br/>\nShe consistently ignored those rules.  Reading<br/>\nabout chores helped me to understand that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when we were eclectic homeschoolers, I would<br/>\nsometimes ask the kids to do a few workbook pages<br/>\nnow and again, basically to satisfy state regulations.<br/>\nThis child is the one who led us down the path to <br/>\nunschooling when she refused to do any work out<br/>\nof the workbooks, and asked, &quot;Why should I do this?&quot;<br/>\nAnd I had to think about that, and realize that she<br/>\nhad a good point there.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and I have talked about rules, about how she feels<br/>\nabout them.  And in a nutshell, she has told me that<br/>\nif there is a rule, she is going to break it.  I asked  her<br/>\nwhy and she said, &quot;Simple.  I don&#39;t like being told what <br/>\nto do.&quot; She wants it to be perfectly clear that nobody can <br/>\nmake her do anything she doesn&#39;t want to do.  She&#39;s right, <br/>\nof course, and that attitude could take her far, or land her <br/>\nin a lot of trouble.  There is an upside and a downside to it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, she likes when rules protect her.  <br/>\nWe still have a rule around here: &quot;If you want to use it, <br/>\nand it belongs to somebody else, ask the owner for <br/>\npermission before using it.&quot;  She will not follow this rule, <br/>\nbut she will also become angry when siblings go into her <br/>\nroom without permission and use her books/toys/space<br/>\nwithout her permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been thinking a lot about rules vs. principles<br/>\nand reading and re-reading about that.  We want <br/>\nour family members to treat one another kindly and<br/>\nwith respect.  And taking things without asking (and<br/>\nthen maybe losing or breaking them) is not very kind<br/>\nor respectful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to what the online misbehavior was:<br/>\n1) She shared an account with another player, which<br/>\nis explicitly against the site&#39;s rules.  <br/>\n2) She often responds to solicitations (&quot;Will you be my<br/>\ngirlfriend?&quot; requests) in the affirmative.<br/>\nShe says she won&#39;t share personal information.  I<br/>\nhope she is being honest with me about that.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;help your children explore the connections!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe I am doing that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s fun (1st of all) ... more fun than it looks like <br/>\n&gt; from where you are at the moment<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree it is fun.

Also, they flat-out tell me that they<br/>\nwill use the computers whenever they want<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I tell them that when I go for a walk or out<br/>\ninto the garden, they have to come with me,<br/>\nso that I can keep an eye on them?
