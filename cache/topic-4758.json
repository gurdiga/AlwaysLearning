The 2 and 3 yo no longer want to be in the stroller and the<br/>\n5yo has zero fear of any situation or stranger, having a tendency to<br/>\ndisappear from parental sight frequently.  Even a trip to the zoo right now<br/>\nis a nightmare.  We would love to go out much more, right now we have to<br/>\nwait until dh&#39;s days off.  I figure another 2 years and life will be much<br/>\nmore freewheeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we do stuff where we are.  We use the internet, the library, the<br/>\ntelevision to bring the world to us for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4636,"nextTopicId":4760}}
