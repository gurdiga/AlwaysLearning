We still haven&#39;t started this project, having become<br/>\ndistracted by other things and ultimately ending up out here in<br/>\nAlbuquerque from last September through at least April or so if all goes<br/>\nas it appears to be going.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son, meanwhile, has found other interests for the moment.  Albuquerque<br/>\nhas several great museums, and for someone as interested as he is in<br/>\ngeology he couldn&#39;t be in a better place.  We&#39;ve climbed five volcanoes so<br/>\nfar and have a few more on our to-do list, not to mention countless past<br/>\n(and future, I&#39;m sure) trips to the natural history museum.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, we&#39;re really looking forward to getting home to Missouri.<br/>\nIf all goes well it&#39;ll be a couple more months.  If it goes really well<br/>\nwe&#39;ll have enough money for a few months off in Missouri.  If not, we<br/>\ncould be temporarily relocating to NC, Florida, Ireland or somewhere<br/>\nas-yet undetermined for another work junket.<br/>\n<br/>\nI miss being the primary at-home parent a great deal.  It&#39;s also really<br/>\nisolating for me (less so for Sage who gets to go to homeschool groups and<br/>\nthe like) to be surrounded by *extremely* conventional people.

I used to have<br/>\nto look at the centre line on the highway ahead.  Usually that meant sitting<br/>\nin the front seat.  If you can drive when she would be sleepy, that&#39;s the<br/>\nbest.

What helps for us:<br/>\n-Sitting in the front seat or somewhere so he can see out the front window.<br/>\n-Having his window open a crack so he gets fresh air on his face<br/>\n***-Stopping every 1/2 hour so he can walk around for a minute or two to get <br/>\ngrounded.    ( I thought of this one as I grew up on the water and every time <br/>\nthat I got sea sick it helped just being on land and it helps him with car <br/>\nsickness too)  We didn&#39;t stop for long just at a rest stop or on a side road <br/>\nso he could walk for a minute.
