Here are my thoughts: I was at a retreat this weekend in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and there ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134494797\">Hi Joanna -<br/>\nThanks so much for sharing your situation.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my thoughts: <br/>\n<br/>\nI was at a retreat this weekend in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and there <br/>\nwas talk of watering wholesome seeds - take care of your wholesome seeds - <br/>\njoy, love, happiness, compassion - so that you are strong to handle the <br/>\nunwholesome seeds - doubt, fear, frustration, anxiety - as they come up..... And when <br/>\nthe unwholesome seeds do grow tall and strong, recognize them, take care of <br/>\nthem, lullabye them - and attend to the wholesome seeds to help them be <br/>\nstronger..... Nature is good for wholesome seeds..... <br/>\n<br/>\nFind a middle road..... when two seemingly polar options are both distasteful <br/>\n- pause, wait, let go of outcome, breathe, let go, and find something else to <br/>\ndo - especially something that nurtures you or your relationship with <br/>\nJack.... <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen MAGIC happen when one lets go!  I bet you have, too!  Just when <br/>\nyou think it&#39;ll never happen..... BOOM - it comes from a different direction <br/>\nand perhaps in a different form!  Letting go frees us to SEE!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s our experience with reading (me and Jaclyn 9yo - who is writing this <br/>\nwith me):<br/>\nWhen she was 7, it was hard not to be a &#39;reader&#39; because other people were <br/>\nreading and it sounded so fun.  She was motivated but it seems her mind and body <br/>\nwere not ready.  Now she is 9 and about 6 months ago (just after she turned <br/>\n9), things just really clicked in incredible ways and she started reading <br/>\nchapter books (esp. A-Z Mysteries series).  She says that she basically didn&#39;t read <br/>\nuntil she was 9.  She has read all 21 books in that series.   <br/>\nI tried to do word cards with her when she was 5 or so and it was very clear <br/>\nthat her mind/eyes/whatever were not putting together the written information. <br/>\n <br/>\nSimilarly, it was a difficult for me sometimes bec. A. she&#39;s a girl and girls <br/>\nread earlier, right?  B. she&#39;s a homeschooler and homeschoolers read earlier, <br/>\nright? and C. she was my oldest and the oldest reads earlier, right? and D. I <br/>\nwas a special ed teacher - and teachers know what to do with teaching <br/>\nreading, right?  <br/>\nPhew!  I guess watching her learn reading allowed me to &#39;water the seeds&#39; of <br/>\ntrust - bec. I had to do it over and over and over....  <br/>\nAnd, also, I would not change anything about her struggle with reading and <br/>\nher incredible satisfaction with having taught herself to read!  She figured it <br/>\nout on her own!!   Like you said that Game Cube teaches reading, I think <br/>\nJaclyn learned from road signs while we were in the car!  (Jaclyn agrees with me!)  <br/>\n Jaclyn says she likes how she learned to read bec. if she had read earlier <br/>\nshe probably wouldn&#39;t have read the books she likes so much now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Joanna, Trust yourself.....  trust Jack..... trust the process.....  <br/>\nIf it doesn&#39;t feel good, don&#39;t do it...... When in doubt, don&#39;t......  <br/>\nLet go..... let go..... and let the magic begin!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch love, <br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19037,"nextTopicId":19050}}
