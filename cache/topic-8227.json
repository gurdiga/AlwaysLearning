He couldn&#39;t move his tongue beyond <br/>\nhis gums when he was born.  I tend to blame that for part of our <br/>\ndifficulties nursing.  We had his frenulum clipped (he didn&#39;t even <br/>\nflinch) at 2 weeks, but by then I had given up nursing.  There were a <br/>\nwhole host of other reasons, too, but I wonder if anybody knows if that <br/>\nshort frenulum can cause problems.  I think surely it can, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever seen it discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8171,"nextTopicId":8165}}
