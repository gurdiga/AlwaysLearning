Well-said Joyce!  I am usually a<br/>\nlurker but just felt like sharing today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have really evolved with this chore thing.  As a child, my whole life<br/>\nwas<br/>\na &quot;have to&quot;.  If I didn&#39;t do x and x then I was restricted or told what<br/>\na<br/>\nbad person I was in so many terms.  I never had chores per say for our<br/>\ngirls<br/>\nuntil we started homeschooling.  I was the one who ordered the &quot;best<br/>\ncurriculum&quot; and set up a chore chart.  (UGH, makes me cringe just<br/>\ntelling<br/>\nya&#39;ll about this!)  Once our girls got to the age of 4 or so we always<br/>\ngave<br/>\nthem some sort of allowance so they could have money of their own and<br/>\nmake<br/>\npurchases or save.  When we pulled our girls out of school the chore<br/>\nchart<br/>\nbecame their way of making money.  No allowance just paid for the chores<br/>\nthey did.  The rule was dh and I would pay for needs and the girls paid<br/>\nfor<br/>\nwants.   Shortly after we began homeschooling we had to move.  We went<br/>\nthrough about a year of living with our parents.  It was during that<br/>\ntime I<br/>\nfound unschooling.  And that is when the paradigm shift started.<br/>\nLuckily my<br/>\ndh and I were on the same page from the beginning.  Of course the worst<br/>\nplace to start unschooling is when you are living with parents whom<br/>\nare/were<br/>\nschoolteachers. Both of our moms have been in the school system for<br/>\nyears.<br/>\nMy mom taught 35 years.  My dh and I stayed strong and kept reading and<br/>\ngrowing.  However, during the transition we started just giving our<br/>\ngirls an<br/>\nallowance again.  Once we moved into our new home and got settled I had<br/>\nbeen<br/>\nreading and growing enough to realize I did not want to &quot;make&quot; my girls<br/>\ndo<br/>\nanything.  I must admit I would get really frustrated at times going<br/>\nbehind<br/>\nthem picking up or cleaning the kitchen.  But I tried really hard not to<br/>\nsay<br/>\nanything. (I failed a few times)  I guess the old records I grew up with<br/>\nare<br/>\nstill there and I have to keep them at bay so they don&#39;t jump on the<br/>\nturntable and start playing.  Both our girls really love to save and to<br/>\nwork<br/>\ntowards a goal if they have something they really want.  So one day my<br/>\noldest asked me what they could do to earn money in addition to their<br/>\nallowance!  So here&#39;s what we do now...Certain items around the house<br/>\nare<br/>\nworth .50 like cleaning the cat box, unloading the dishwasher, folding<br/>\nclothes, emptying trash, etc. Then depending on things they pick up on<br/>\nthemselves they get more.  For example, yesterday I came home and my<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n13yo had vacuumed part of the house, cleaned windows and mirrors, and<br/>\nsomething else I can&#39;t remember.  We talked about a fair wage and came<br/>\nup<br/>\nwith $6.00.  Ended up I owed her $5.50 already so she asked for $6.50 to<br/>\nmake the total even!  Got to love it :) Occasionally the girls will<br/>\nargue<br/>\nover who called the dishwasher or a load of clothes.  They are earning<br/>\npretty good money I must say.  Tomorrow our family is running a<br/>\nconcession<br/>\nstand at a horse show and the girls want to help so we will pay them.<br/>\nThis<br/>\nwhole thing has turned into a great way for them to earn money and<br/>\npurchase<br/>\nthose &quot;wants&quot;.  They both have been setting some money aside to open a<br/>\nsavings account.  It has opened the door for some great discussion<br/>\nsurrounding investments, purchases, etc.  I don&#39;t tell them not to buy<br/>\nsomething but will sometimes help them think through it.  Sometimes they<br/>\nbuy<br/>\nanyway and later wished they hadn&#39;t, but that&#39;s life.  We have all done<br/>\nsome<br/>\nthings like that.  It is just another opportunity to learn.  I suggested<br/>\nthey keep a journal/log of their income and expenditures.  They<br/>\nsometimes<br/>\nwould wonder why they didn&#39;t have as much money as they thought.  So<br/>\nboth of<br/>\nthem keep a list of income and how they got it and on the other side<br/>\nthey<br/>\nkeep a running log of what they spend and where they spent it.  My<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n10yo went on a spending spree one day and spent $43.87.  So she decided<br/>\nto<br/>\nnot spend anything else until she had replaced that amount.  She worked<br/>\nhard<br/>\nand it didn&#39;t take her long before she earned it back.  But in the<br/>\nprocess<br/>\nof doing this she got a separate piece of paper and at the top put<br/>\n$43.87<br/>\nand every time she earned money she would subtract it from the $43.87<br/>\nuntil<br/>\nthe total came to zero.  And people wonder how we do math!  There are<br/>\nsome<br/>\nadults that couldn&#39;t keep up with money management the way my girls can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plus for me is I have a lot of help around the house now and<br/>\neverybody<br/>\nis still smiling! :)  Maybe this will help someone else or maybe some of<br/>\nyou<br/>\nhave other thoughts that might make this better.....Looking forward to<br/>\nmore<br/>\ndiscussion....<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey Inman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
