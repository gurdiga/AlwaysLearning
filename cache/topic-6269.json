The virus apparently caused itself to be<br/>\nautomatically sent to addresses on the &quot;sender&#39;s&quot; computer. Before we got an<br/>\nanti-virus program we got that same virus, and it autimatically sent itself<br/>\nto every email address listed anywhere on our computer, not just in the<br/>\naddress book. A friend of ours told us how to get rid of it, but that email<br/>\nwas saved on our old computer, not this one. I am sure that you could find<br/>\nout on the symatec website. This time our anti-virus caught it immediately<br/>\nand quarantined it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer open attachments that I am not expecting, or that the sender<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t include a message telling me that they are sending the attachment<br/>\nand what it is for. All but one of the viruses that we got on our old<br/>\ncomputer were unwittingly sent by people we knew (or at least by their<br/>\ncomputers). So only opening attachments from people you know is not safe. If<br/>\nI get an attachment from someone I know, I will email them back and ask them<br/>\nabout it before opening it. If it is from someone I don&#39;t know, I just<br/>\ndelete the message - attachment and all - without opening it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6268,"nextTopicId":6271}}
