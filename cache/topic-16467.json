I just read the eye-opening, appalling &quot;What<br/>\nHappened to Recess and Why Are Our Children Struggling in Kindergarten?&quot; by<br/>\nSusan Ohanian.  It&#39;s about those great tests your sister is so worked up<br/>\nabout. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, The Schools Our Children Deserve.  The <br/>\nthings he recommends, like following a child&#39;s interests, are easy to do <br/>\nat home and hard to do in the classroom.  And he backs up everything he <br/>\nsays with research.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16459,"nextTopicId":16469}}
