The first book I read to Chamille, <br/>\nother than picture books, was Charlotte&#39;s Web.  There are a lot of wonderful <br/>\nshort stories like that, short chapters, good story lines, and pictures. <br/>\n Chamille wanted to be able to read at 5, but she didn&#39;t pick up her own book <br/>\nuntil she was 11.  Chamille experienced frustration and pressure form neighbor <br/>\nkids, but book for book she&#39;s acquired more than all of them combined, so was <br/>\nable to jump into the games they all played adding elements from stories.  Even <br/>\nthough she felt that frustration, she was able to seamlessly play fantasy games <br/>\nwith intricate plots.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time she was 11, she&#39;d had so many books read to her, listened to so many <br/>\nbooks on tape and cd, that she knew how words flowed together, she knew what <br/>\nwords sounded like and what they meant.  We read books that movies were made <br/>\ninto and compared.  We did that enough times that she started doing it on her <br/>\nown.  Her first critical comparison was of the movie and book Carrie.  Her <br/>\nanalysis blew me away.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing how to read is only a part of the equation.  The other part is what is <br/>\nbeing read.  We filled Chamille&#39;s life with stories and imaginative worlds <br/>\nthrough books and movies.  Another part is doing things you love.  The primary <br/>\nthing that helped Chamille read was an online RPG that required a fair amount of <br/>\nreading.  We played with her as much as we could and when she played solo, she <br/>\nfigured out how to communicate with other players with reading and writing via <br/>\nchat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter wasn&#39;t as interested in being read to, still isn&#39;t.  She <br/>\nliked, and still does, particular picture books, I Spy books, puzzle books, <br/>\nmysteries, Where&#39;s Waldo?, and books that have lift the flap and other tactile <br/>\nthings.  She&#39;s 9, and is reading fluently.  Over the last couple of years, we&#39;ve <br/>\nplayed a LOT of Nancy Drew pc games.  They have a story line, puzzles, and <br/>\nreading, not so different from the books she&#39;s liked over the years.  She plays <br/>\nDS games as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my girls explored what they liked and learned to read as a side effect <br/>\nof being around words.  Happily do things together that you guys love.

You&#39;re <br/>\nfollowing words on page with your finger. And you&#39;re correcting her when <br/>\nshe does try to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a LOT. And she&#39;s not reacted well and has made it very clear it <br/>\nisn&#39;t what she needs right now. I think you should completely back off <br/>\nof ALL the above things. Try to NOT find &quot;reading&quot; books or shows - try <br/>\nto find more that do not require reading. Do not correct her at ALL <br/>\nunless she actually asks. Stop running your finger under words when you <br/>\nread to her. You can create &quot;reading disabilities&quot; due to anxiety and <br/>\nfrustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf SHE asks to learn to read - you might ask her &quot;What word do you want <br/>\nto learn first?&quot; Write the word on an index card and hand it to her. <br/>\nThat&#39;s it. Don&#39;t talk about it and don&#39;t tell her what to do with it. If <br/>\nshe asks for more words, again ask her what word she wants to learn and <br/>\nwrite it on a card and hand it to her. Do this calmly and simply and <br/>\nwithout discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she expresses frustration, reassure her that she will learn when her <br/>\nbrain is ready, that it is still growing. And tell her that kids learn <br/>\nto read at all different ages and there is no hurry. Get her audiobooks <br/>\nto listen to, so that she doesn&#39;t have to rely only on you reading to <br/>\nher because she might now feel that your reading aloud times have become <br/>\nunsuccessful reading lessons, and you can say that lots of grown-ups <br/>\nread by listening to books, too, instead of reading them with their eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF she likes to have her words on cards, you can expand that to a game <br/>\nby writing action words on cards and holding them up for her to <br/>\nrecognize and do the action. For example, write, &quot;JUMP,&quot; &quot;SIT,&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;HOP&quot; on cards. Mix them up and hold up one. If she doesn&#39;t get it right <br/>\naway - you do it Be funny. She&#39;ll probably figure out the first letter <br/>\nsound and respond just to that. That&#39;s fine (be sure to use three words <br/>\nthat start with different letters). IF she likes this game, add more <br/>\nactions -- &quot;DANCE,&quot; &quot;RUN,&quot; &quot;FALL.&quot; Again, use words that all start with <br/>\ndifferent first letters. Your focus is NOT on challenging her, but on <br/>\nmaking it fun for her. If it isn&#39;t fun, just let the idea go.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also did Sandra&#39;s idea of post-it notes on things and mixing them up <br/>\nand the kids laughing when they&#39;d discover the lamp labeled as the <br/>\nrefrigerator, etc. The kids did this themselves when they were reading <br/>\nalready a bit. My mom kept a little drawer full of post-it notes of all <br/>\nkinds - cute ones. The kids would always go into grandma&#39;s post-it notes <br/>\nand pretend write her notes and stick them in very unexpected places (in <br/>\nthe freezer, in her medicine cabinet, on the front of the tv, in her <br/>\ndresser drawer, back of the toilet, etc. Slowly, over months and years, <br/>\nthe notes would go from pretend writing to pretend writing with the <br/>\nchild&#39;s actual name, to pretend writing with, &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; and &quot;FROM&quot; on <br/>\nit, to real writing with lots of misspellings and weirdly shaped <br/>\nletters, to finally normal writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids learn to read BY learning to write, by the way. So if your <br/>\ndaughter is writing letters, then go with that --- support THAT since <br/>\nthat&#39;s what shes actually doing. Maybe get her a really pretty box (they <br/>\nsell gorgeous boxes of all sizes at Michael&#39;s - even boxes that look <br/>\nlike books) and collect some cool paper and colored pencils, pens, <br/>\nmarkers, but also stickers and stamps and other things that are easier <br/>\nthan writing. Stamps that say little things are great - &quot;I Love You&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re the Greatest&quot; kind of support kids in writing notes to family <br/>\nmembers.  I had a stamp that said, &quot;From&quot; and my kids would write notes <br/>\nbecause they wanted to stamp, &quot;FROM.....&quot; (fill in their own name). <br/>\nThere was a while that my kids were writing so many notes that we made <br/>\nlittle mailboxes for each family member so they kids could deliver and <br/>\npick up their mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just remembered something that was super cute at the time -- Roya is 6 <br/>\nyears older than Rosie and Roxana is 3 years older. Plus Roxana learned <br/>\nto read and write very young and Rosie didn&#39;t learn until she was 8. So <br/>\nthere were a lot of years when Roya and Roxana could read and write well <br/>\nand Rosie wasn&#39;t doing either yet, at all. When Rosie would write her <br/>\n&quot;mail&quot; and deliver it to her sisters&#39; mailboxes, they would get it and <br/>\nrun to her and say, &quot;Rosie - read it to me!!&quot; (It was nonsense writing <br/>\nin between stamps.) Rosie would pretend to read it to them. And when she <br/>\ngot a note from them, she&#39;d run excitedly to them to ask them to read it <br/>\nto her. Clearly the idea of written notes taking the place of speaking <br/>\ndirectly was entirely lost on all of them - they were just having fun <br/>\nplaying mail delivery. Sometimes I remember they wanted to write <br/>\ncomplete addresses on the front of the envelope.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it that when kids have access to lots of stickers and stamps, <br/>\nthey sometimes like to write stories about them. We used to put one <br/>\nsticker at the top of a page and then the child would tell a story about <br/>\nit and I&#39;d write it down on the page. We&#39;d collect those and make a <br/>\nsticker-story book. For example, there might be a sticker of a chicken. <br/>\nThat would go at the top and then the kid would start with, &quot;Once there <br/>\nwas a chicken. Its name was Henry.&quot; And so on. I&#39;d write that under the <br/>\nsticker. Some of the stories were just about that much - two lines. Some <br/>\nwent on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - don&#39;t do ANYTHING that isn&#39;t being done because it is fun. But <br/>\nif a child has an urge to write, then offering fun things to do that <br/>\ninvolve writing is what unschooling is - supporting a child&#39;s interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some great books - old, but still around, called &quot;Games for <br/>\nReading,&quot; &quot;Games for Learning,&quot; &quot;Games for Math,&quot; and &quot;Games for <br/>\nWriting.&quot; All by Peggy Kaye.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I need to warn you again, though, consider these as GAMES - <br/>\nnot as lessons - and offer them the same way you&#39;d offer to play Go Fish <br/>\nor Checkers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - watch your child and support more of what the child is ACTUALLY <br/>\npursuing - expand on it and enrich it. One thing will lead to another - <br/>\nlet one thing lead to another naturally, don&#39;t try to push it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing - if and when a child starts playing around with the <br/>\nsounds of words (not in writing, in sound), then that&#39;s a good time to <br/>\nplay word games and rhyming games. If you introduce word games and <br/>\nrhyming games when a child isn&#39;t interested, they&#39;ll just be <br/>\nfrustrating. Not good. But if they are interested, a good starting game <br/>\nis &quot;My name is Jane and my husband&#39;s name is Jack. We live in Japan and <br/>\nwe sell Jugs.&quot;  But you start from the letter &quot;A&quot; and take turns, each <br/>\nperson does the next letter of the alphabet. The simplest rhyming game <br/>\nis to just start off with a word and take turns trying to find a word <br/>\nthat rhymes with it. Make it really simple - &quot;CAT,&quot; &quot;SAT,&quot; &quot;BAT,&quot; &quot;FAT,&quot; <br/>\netc. You don&#39;t keep score on these games - you just go until someone <br/>\ncan&#39;t think of one, then other people help them, then when nobody can <br/>\nthink of one, you start a new round.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly we played these kinds of games in the car or while waiting (in <br/>\nlines or in places like hospital waiting rooms, for example &lt;g&gt;). My <br/>\nkids are 26, 23, and 20 and we still play them (slightly more <br/>\ncomplicated ones) in the car on road trips. And my husband recently went <br/>\non a work trip with a bunch of co-workers in a couple of 13-person vans. <br/>\nHe got all the people in his van playing word games. On the way back, <br/>\neverybody wanted to be in his van because they&#39;d had so much fun (an 8 <br/>\nhour drive).<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling Reading for my almost-5y.o.","postDate":"1308242472","msgId":61606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFODA5OUIzLTBCODQtNDE2Qi1BMkY0LTY2ODc4REMzQTRGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0Y3JwMituOXUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0Y3JwMituOXUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61602,"nextInTopic":61608,"prevInTime":61605,"nextInTime":61607,"topicId":61600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=Since she is already copying and writing out words, I would maybe point that out to her and tell her that what she is doing is a part of reading.

My son is 5 too and he&#39;s gone through periods over the last year or so where he would switch letters in his name, or start writing a letter backward that he previous wrote out the right way, but we just let it be. We knew what he was writing and he knew what he was writing and that was enough at the time. He has figured out how things go just by seeing his name in other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she really wants to learn to read, I would maybe tell her that one way to learn to read is just for the two of you to read together. Just by her listening and watching you read, that will help her learn to read. She can read books to you by repeating as much of the story as she remembers, or by making up the story, or she might have other ideas. You could also find books that have less words. There is a book by Jez Alborough called Hug that only has the word hug for most of the book. My son has loved it ever since he was very little (it&#39;s a very sweet book) and now it is a book he can read to his baby sister even if it is only because it has one word. You could also try wordless books if she enjoys making up her own stories. Maybe expand into other activities, you could write down stories she makes up and she could add pictures (or even copy the stories down onto another piece of paper since she seems to enjoy copying words already).  One of my son&#39;s favorite games has been to write out strings of random letters and asking me to read them, and I try sounding out all the letters and it makes him laugh. Once he wrote &quot;fox&quot; by chance and he was so excited about that one that he has remembered how to spell that word ever since. Think of other reading related activities that she is capable of doing right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that is helpful!<br/>\nAnnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My almost 5 year old has told me that she wants to know how to read.
