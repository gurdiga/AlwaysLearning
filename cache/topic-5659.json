Ila (2.5) is now saying, &quot;I the manatee girl!&quot;  She&#39;s very <br/>\nexcited about these gentle animals (we even got a plastic model from the <br/>\nmachine that makes them as you wait).  Of course, it was a weekday and there <br/>\nwere many school groups with nametags, uniforms and clipboards with <br/>\nworksheets on them.  So many children (about grades 1-3) were simply skimming <br/>\nthe info cards for the &quot;right answers&quot; and not even watching the <br/>\nanimals/fish.  I was pointing out the cool stuff (otters, turtles, wading <br/>\nbirds, etc) in the native Florida section while trying not to let the girls <br/>\nget away from me and/or get trampled by the herd.  I even mentioned to one <br/>\nteacher (who had her won clipboard with worksheet on it), &quot;Don&#39;t you <br/>\nsometimes wish you could just bring the kids here without the questions to <br/>\nask?&quot;  She said, &quot;Yes, and I also wish we could spend more time here.  It <br/>\ntakes longer to organize and get here and back to school than the time we get <br/>\ninside looking.&quot;  How sad!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn,  we own Kiki and get Totoro from the library.  My kids have nearly <br/>\nmemorized all the dialogue from Kiki and walk around quoting, &quot;Pardon me, <br/>\nMiss Snooty Cat.&quot; and laughing hysterically.  As soon as we saw Kiki say, &quot;I <br/>\ncan&#39;t just take her money and not help.&quot;, DH said, &quot;We are buying this movie!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, I haven&#39;t used so many quote marks in quite a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley:  if you are in the Asheville, NC area this summer look us up.  We&#39;ve <br/>\ngot some space and are always up for playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn:  My theory as to why women get more liberal while men get more <br/>\nconservative with age is this:  Women have less to lose as they age and their <br/>\n&quot;commodities&quot; of youth and beauty lessen as their wisdom and vitality <br/>\nincrease.  The culture does not notice the less young and beautiful, so there <br/>\nis less pressure to be &quot;in the box&quot;.  Men, on the other hand, increase in <br/>\nstature, financial responsibility, and social pressure as they age.  There is <br/>\nmore expectation that they have &quot;sown their wild oats&quot; and will settle down <br/>\nand be responsible and contribute to society for the furtherment of others <br/>\nlike them.  It&#39; s sad, but true for the poor guys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiAnna, who waxes philosophical in the spring rain, and who now better go do <br/>\nsomething fun like play tickle with the kids : )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5658,"nextTopicId":5646}}
