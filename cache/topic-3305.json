I wrote this afternoon about the<br/>\nwonderful time I had with Zak making chocolate covered strawberries... Then<br/>\nMax got up and we were still making them.  He wanted to help.  I kept him<br/>\naway from the stove and made sure it was off and I turned away for 5 seconds<br/>\nand Max (2,5 yrs) put his hand on the burner.... Hubby walked in from work 3<br/>\nmins later and we ended up at the hospital.  He has 2nd degree burns on his<br/>\nright hand, possibly 3rd,  we are taking him to the burn unit tomorrow<br/>\nmorning at 7am, the first time they can see him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does this have to do with toxic in-laws and mothers?  I called my<br/>\nmother and asked her if she would watch Zak in the morning so that hubby and<br/>\nI can go together and she&#39;d been drinking (again)... She started saying all<br/>\nkinds of strange things such as &quot;You need to be careful THEY don&#39;t take your<br/>\nchildren away&quot;... &quot;Whose they?&quot; was my response.... She started going on<br/>\nabout CPS, Welfare, they were only intersted in the kids and could think I&#39;d<br/>\nburned him deliberately.... Of course this was just the joyful news I needed<br/>\nto hear when I was already having a hard time with the fact that he was with<br/>\nme when he got burned.  She even asked me &quot;where were you&quot;.... I didn&#39;t need<br/>\nto justify myself but out of habit did (I thought that one had gone by the<br/>\nwayside)... I turned to put a plate in the sink and in 5 seconds his hand<br/>\nwas on the stove...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents not only don&#39;t support homeschooling, they have no clue was<br/>\nunschooling is and don&#39;t want to learn anything, read anything or know<br/>\nanything about it.  They are unsupportive in the decisions we make for our<br/>\nchildren.  I guess I&#39;d just been sucked in lately to my mother being nice.<br/>\nI forget she&#39;s like the Black Widow Spider who will do anything to get you<br/>\ninto her net and then strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can imagine I&#39;m feeling a bit overwhelmed tonight and your thoughts<br/>\nand prayers for a swift recovery of my adorable Max would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\nbtw, we&#39;re in the same boat with the toxic inlaws, too. in fact, their<br/>\n<br/>\nextremely negative (verbal, in front of our child) response to our choice to<br/>\nopt<br/>\n<br/>\nfor &quot;this homeschooling bulls**t&quot; (the last in a string of negative<br/>\nresponses to<br/>\n<br/>\njust about every parenting choice we&#39;ve made) has caused us to pretty much<br/>\ncut<br/>\n<br/>\noff contact.
