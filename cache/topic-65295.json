Just make their favorite sandwiches and cut them into 1/4s.<br/>\nnuts and seeds.  We buy raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds and toss them with tamari and then roast them in the oven.  Yummy<br/>\ncut up cheese, fruit, vegetables, chicken/meat, marinated tofu<br/>\ncelery with peanut or other nut butters<br/>\nmini muffins<br/>\ndips: hummos, bean, queso, guacamole.....<br/>\nnachos: corn chips with beans, cheese and guacamole<br/>\nwe make a lot of smoothies too, and they&#39;re often the foundation of Noor&#39;s main proteins. Right now, she&#39;s loving coconut milk, almond butter and chocolate sauce, but often they&#39;re yogurt, fruit, something sweet like maple syrup and maybe even some vegetables like spinach or kale. If you have bananas that are getting mushy, slice them and put them in the freezer. They&#39;re great in smoothies and add sweetness and act as a thickener. <br/>\nThis site has great recipes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smoothieweb.com/\">http://www.smoothieweb.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] grazing snacks","postDate":"1327691058","msgId":65296,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMjE5NzdDLTlEN0MtNDUyMS1BNTJBLTc4RTkzRTM5QzY5N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpmdXFuZCs4b28zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpmdXFuZCs4b28zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65295,"nextInTopic":65297,"prevInTime":65295,"nextInTime":65297,"topicId":65295,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter (for adults, it s like party food) http://sandradodd.com/eating/protein That list was made by a vegetarian.

My hubby comes home for lunch and likes his main meal then.He doesn&#39;t feel well on heavy evening meals.I usually cook once a day.The kids like thier milk in the morning so that leaves P.M and evening help yourself to whatever is around.Thought it would be good time for a good grazing snack.Thanks!
