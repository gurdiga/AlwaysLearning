It s too rough","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1917420226\">Oh, not playing with Barbie or owning one, but Diana Jenner sent me a  <br/>\nBarbie link, and the stuff was amusing my GREATLY, but for two  <br/>\nthings.  It&#39;s too rough for my Barbie page (which is http:// <br/>\nsandradodd.com/barbie ) and some of the Barbie quotes were hot  <br/>\nlinks.  I followed one.  eeep....   current real discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m reading this one, feeling sad for all concerned, and saw  <br/>\nwithout even reading the responses that people were generally just  <br/>\nagreeing with her and &quot;supporting&quot; her.  Maybe one of them gave her  <br/>\nthe kind of advice about being gentle and understand that she would  <br/>\nget from this list or on other kinda-related lists.  Pretty much they  <br/>\ntook her side, in what seems to me an &quot;us vs. them&quot; way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I deal with my defiant 2yo dd? She closes her eyes and ignores  <br/>\nme when I try to reprimand her!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[ K-8 General Board ]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by Hannah on 13:00 Aug 2<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario this evening was that 6yo dd and 2yo dd were in the  <br/>\nbath. 2yo wanted something from 6yo - and smacked her when she  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get it. Of course, this is not allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur usually response is to ask the offending child to apologise to  <br/>\nthe &quot;victim&quot; and to take the child out of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, when I asked 2yo to apologise and hug her sister, she just shut  <br/>\nher eyes and completely ignored me! Even when I took her out of the  <br/>\nbath and started to dress her, she kept her body still and her eyes  <br/>\nshut the whole time!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up putting her into bed - and there wasn&#39;t even a glimse. I  <br/>\nhave to admit I was impressed that a child so small can be so stubborn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I have to rethink how we parent this child - what worked for the  <br/>\nolder is not going to work fir her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advise?<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow Ups:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s young.
