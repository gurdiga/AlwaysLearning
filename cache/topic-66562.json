My mom had a &quot;no singing at the table&quot; rule.  Because you could choke, was her explanation when I asked.  But it meant someone couldn&#39;t even say &quot;I heard a new song today, and it was like this...&quot; and sing a phrase of it.

That&#39;s what our first one ever was, and also done to be like the monkeys at the zoo. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary reason I ever recommended it to others was because there seemed to be a steady stream of self-righteous mothers eager to criticize their children (almost always boys) for playing video games or watching their favorite shows until they were really hungry, but they weren&#39;t willing to turn them off to come and eat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf eating is important, if food has a purpose, then it makes sense to put food where they&#39;re doing something that is THAT fascinating, and that engrossing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd those discussions, years ago, came at the height of the days when just about every mom who came to unschooling discussions was flipped out because school or relatives or a doctor or the parents themselves were saying their child was ADD or ADHD (and there were daily discussions of the difference in those).  Here they had a child clearly showing that he COULD pay serious attention to something for WAY more than two hours, and now they were complaining that he didn&#39;t have the ability to turn it off to go to another room and eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople hardly talk about ADHD anymore.  Now they blame diet for things they see in their children that they wish were different.  But still, a plate of food the mother has no fears or concerns about will help maintain health and a good mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that the idea of setting the food down without saying &quot;i want you to eat this,&quot; or &quot;Here, you should be  hungry by now,&quot; but just setting it down with quiet sweetness and love, is related to the La Leche League practices (at least where I was, 20-25 years ago) of following a baby&#39;s cues, of not feeding on a schedule or trying to measure or count, but nurse the baby when he showed the desire or possible need, and be available, and to &quot;wean&quot; babies by neither offering nor refusing to nurse, as they got older and were starting to eat food.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when and how to offer monkey platters was, for me, an extension of that  mothering that had made me aware of what might keep them content.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332164648,"authorName":"Rippy and Graham Dusseldorp","from":"Rippy and Graham Dusseldorp &lt;ripgray@...&gt;","profile":"rdusseldorp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Meals, Monkey platters and diversity","postDate":"1333797017","msgId":66585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2NzdEMzFDLTFGRUYtNEI2NS05QjE2LUZCREVEQzI1ODJFNkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsb2EzZyt0ajEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpsb2EzZyt0ajEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66584,"nextInTopic":66589,"prevInTime":66584,"nextInTime":66586,"topicId":66562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There was always a box of kleenex or a roll of paper towels next to it for messy hands. She made them with a lot of love, care and warmth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember the moms of my Chinese friend, Korean friend, and Ukrainian friend often made similar mixed plates of their own ethnic foods to offer us when I visited. The food was given with a lot of warmth and affection.

Pasta sauce on bread is different than on pasta - and if you add a slice of cheese and you have a mini pizza ;) Or try veggie dips on rice or pasta. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do that with desserts, too - make extra cake and freeze it to reheat later with yogurt or custard for a fancy snack. Or make extra cookie dough, extra pie crust, etc, to save and recombine in interesting ways - see if your kids want to experiment with you!

I was going through a period where I was<br/>\nsleep deprived and having trouble coming up with ideas beyond string cheese<br/>\nand pistachio nuts.  I *knew* my kids ate more than that but in the moment<br/>\nI was having trouble coming up with something.  So over a couple of days I<br/>\nmade a list on a sheet of paper and pasted it on the inside door of one of<br/>\nmy cabinets.  We still have sit down breakfasts and either my husband or  I<br/>\nmake dinner every night however Harry who is 5 has never much liked sitting<br/>\ndown to dinner.  He is usually too busy playing so he sort of pops in and<br/>\nout to give us updates on what he&#39;s doing.  Harry tends to have days where<br/>\nit seems like he eats nothing (although that isn&#39;t true) so I try to bring<br/>\nhim snacks where he is so he doesn&#39;t run out of fuel.  I bring him a plate<br/>\nwith small amounts of things.  1/2 an apple sliced thin; a few crackers,<br/>\nmaybe 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich, some nuts or mellon, or slices of<br/>\nsalami or turkey or something like that.  Some times he eats it sometimes<br/>\nnot.  He is always pleased when I bring it to him either way.  I think the<br/>\npurpose of Monkey Platters is getting away from the idea that you eat at<br/>\nmealtimes whatever Mom is serving or go hungry.  People can&#39;t learn when<br/>\nthey are hungry; many children need to fuel up frequently; so don&#39;t limit<br/>\nfood to three times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because you are unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you never cook a meal again.<br/>\n If your daughter wants warm food then make some warm food.  Some times I<br/>\nmake meals with different components and people can assemble their own<br/>\nplates (some times it&#39;s make your own salad, or tacos, or pizza)  Sometimes<br/>\nwe have sandwich night and at least a couple of times a month Jim cooks<br/>\nbreakfast for dinner.  Sometimes we make plain chicken for the kids and<br/>\nmake a fancy sauce or or salsa for us.  Some day they will want to try it.<br/>\n Until then focus on trying to make meal times a time of connection and use<br/>\nthe monkey platters to help keep kids fueled up between times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia (Gabriella 7.5 and Harry 5.5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Apr 6, 2012 at 9:10 AM, Claire Darbaud &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdarbaud@...\">cdarbaud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My family and I are experimenting with monkey platters.

My son loves them,<br/>\nmy daughter is not so sure. Sometimes she loves them and sometimes she<br/>\ncomplains that she wants a &quot;real&quot; meal with warm food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if you would share how diverse you make your monkey platters.<br/>\nMaking one is fun, but making them more often I&#39;m not sure. I would like to<br/>\nget more confortable with it, but right now, I spend a lot of time<br/>\nwondering what to put on them. I have looked at the monkey platters page<br/>\nfor ideas, but if you reduce that to what my children like there aren&#39;t<br/>\nthat many things to choose from...<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a sort of base of stuff that&#39;s always there and then change one<br/>\nthing or two? How many platters do you make in a day? Do you make them<br/>\neveryday? Do you make one for each person or a big one for all the family<br/>\nto share? Have you tried a buffet? How do you store the left overs?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you still make regular meals?  How diverse do you make your meails? I<br/>\nseem to end up cooking a lot of pasta because my kids like them, but we all<br/>\nget bored of too much pasta, more and more the kids welcome the pasta dish<br/>\nwith a &quot;not again!&quot;. But a lot of times, when I try and cook something<br/>\nelse, they don&#39;t want it either...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny hints will be super appreciated :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66616,"nextTopicId":66689}}
