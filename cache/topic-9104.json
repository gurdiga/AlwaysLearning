I also got her message from the *dress <br/>\nfor success* thread about earning the right to wear a beard twice. Other <br/>\nproblems I have been having with both lists is; I will get a reply someone <br/>\nhas written to someone else&#39;s post and won&#39;t get the OP till much later, and <br/>\nsometimes what I post won&#39;t show up for hours, or ever. <br/>\nI hope this is just a fluke! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9036,"nextTopicId":9019}}
