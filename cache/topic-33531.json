In a <br/>\nmore loving situation, we read those same signals as who is o.k. and who might need <br/>\nmore social help, and we befriend that person, not single them out for the kill!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if I look at their responses as coming from <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; people who don&#39;t know how to live life joyfully, I WILL feel truly <br/>\n&gt; compassionate towards them and be able to respond from my heart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>And these people, seen through a different lens, may also be challenging you and your <br/>\nkids to see if you&#39;ll break.  If you don&#39;t, maybe there&#39;s something worthwhile there.  I <br/>\nremember so clearly the moment when I decided I would swear.  I didn&#39;t want to, but it <br/>\nwas cool, so I did.  I swore to my mother, and for the first time she didn&#39;t stop me.  I so <br/>\nwanted her to stop me and was shocked when she didn&#39;t.  I actually felt abandoned!  But <br/>\nthe point is that to her I was bristly and confrontative and in her face, but inside me I was <br/>\nsmall and looking for love and connection.  I kept the bristly exterior because my real <br/>\nneeds weren&#39;t met, but I knew inside it was all show.  Perhaps your family is a lot of bristly <br/>\nshow that looks rough on the outside, but hides a lot of pain on the inside.  There&#39;s some <br/>\nchance that as you show a confident person, able to connect with her children instead of <br/>\ncause them pain, some things will come out that may surprise you--but it may not <br/>\nhappen in the larger group setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: How do you talk to family about respect","postDate":"1206374889","msgId":33551,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYwQTg0NkZDLTIxMjYtNEE0RS05MDA1LUQyRTZBNzcwRTVFQ0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZzOGJjYytoNjhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZzOGJjYytoNjhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33548,"nextInTopic":33553,"prevInTime":33550,"nextInTime":33552,"topicId":33531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am a very sensitive <br/>\nperson, so responding to family members with compassion would feel <br/>\nright to me.  I think if I look at their responses as coming from <br/>\npeople who don&#39;t know how to live life joyfully, I WILL feel truly <br/>\ncompassionate towards them and be able to respond from my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other issue is, because I was controlled so much as a child and <br/>\nalways felt the need (very real need due to the abuse) to please my <br/>\nmother, I still feel like I have to please everyone.  One of the <br/>\nissues that came up yesterday was that my husband&#39;s brother carried <br/>\nmy ds(5) out to the car after church against his will.  My brother-in-<br/>\nlaw was &quot;helping&quot; me out because, as has been said in my husband&#39;s <br/>\nfamily many times behind my back and also to me, &quot;Melissa doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to control/handle M.&quot; (Ds is very intense). I think he was <br/>\njust taking it upon himself to be &quot;helpful&quot; to me.  Then he forced DS <br/>\ninto his car seat and shut the car door.  When I got in the car, DS <br/>\nwas crying and said, &quot;Mommy, why didn&#39;t you make Uncle J put me <br/>\ndown?  I didn&#39;t want to be carried.  I wanted to walk like a big <br/>\nboy.&quot;  I apologized to him and told him I should have told Uncle J to <br/>\nput him down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, while my brother-in-law was carrying him, DS was not crying <br/>\nor screaming.  BIL was doing silly things like holding him upside <br/>\ndown, etc. that DS usually loves.  When I noticed that DS didn&#39;t like <br/>\nwhat was going on was when BIL started forcing him into the car <br/>\nseat.  Also, BIL was getting forceful in his tone of voice and what <br/>\nhe said to DS.  I didn&#39;t say anything because I was afraid of the <br/>\nconfrontation (we&#39;re in a church parking lot and lots of people are <br/>\naround).  Looking back, what I did was let my precious son know that <br/>\nhis feelings were not as important as me &quot;pleasing&quot; my brother-in-<br/>\nlaw.  Wow.  That hurts.  That makes me feel ashamed of myself.  I <br/>\njust don&#39;t know how to get over the fear of confrontation, even <br/>\npeaceful confrontation.  Maybe those old feelings of what happened as <br/>\na child surface in the moment when confrontation comes up.  How do <br/>\nyou get over that?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I know everyone in my husband&#39;s family thinks I can&#39;t handle my <br/>\nson and that I need lots of help, and this has been going on since DS <br/>\nwas around 2 and before I knew about unschooling or the philosophy of <br/>\nliving life joyfully and peacefully.  I was using tools from my past <br/>\nto deal with my son.  Now I know a better way, but my husband&#39;s <br/>\nfamily is unaware of this philosophy and basically think I am <br/>\nwhimping out on my responsibility to &quot;deal&quot; with my DS.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI need help in learning ways to respond to these family members that <br/>\nlove me and think they are helping me.  I know my new way of living <br/>\ndoes not look &quot;normal&quot; to them.  It looks to them like I am letting <br/>\nmy children &quot;get away with it&quot;. I need to learn ways to handle <br/>\nconfrontation and how to stand up for my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;carnationsgalore&quot; <br/>\n&lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can you give me some ideas on ways I can prepare my children for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dealing with these disrespectful relatives?

Now I have another concern.  My in laws have the <br/>\nattitude that most people have.  They treat children as if they were <br/>\nnot deserving of their respect.  We had a family get together for <br/>\nEaster and it was so difficult to watch all the coercion, threats, <br/>\npunishment, etc. that went on.  Now that I am getting more familiar <br/>\nwith unschooling, that stuff looks horrible to me.  I almost can&#39;t bear <br/>\nto watch it go on. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s family is probably pretty typical as far as what most <br/>\npeople believe regarding discipline.  I felt so &quot;foreign&quot; today as I <br/>\ntried to handle my children in a respectful manner.  Remarks were made <br/>\nnot directly to me but in general like, &quot;When I was a kid, I got <br/>\nspanked for something like that!&quot; or &quot;When I was a kid, I had to eat <br/>\neverything on my plate,&quot; (DD(8) didn&#39;t clean her plate but wanted to <br/>\neat some of her Easter candy) and just those types of remarks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a child, my mother was very &quot;brick wall&quot;.  We were all <br/>\nscared to death of her.  She was not only manipulative, but verbally, <br/>\nemotionally and physical abusive as well.  I think that may be why I <br/>\nhave such a hard time speaking up for myself even when I know what I am <br/>\ndoing is right and confronting people.  I always tried to make my <br/>\nmother happy to avoid any of the consequences, so now I find myself <br/>\n(even at 40 something) always trying to please others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so hard for me to even think of anything to say when these <br/>\nremarks were going around the dinner table and afterwards.  I just seem <br/>\nto freeze up.  Also, I first heard about unschooling back in September, <br/>\nso there is still so much I am trying to figure out myself and I am <br/>\nstill finding out what it is I truly do believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some ways that I can talk to my family about being respectful <br/>\nto children?  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, does anyone know if there is a way to do a blog where only people <br/>\nyou want to read it can --- like maybe they have to have a password or <br/>\nsomething?  I thought maybe if I had some sort of Private blog, my <br/>\nfamily and my husband&#39;s family could read about what we do and maybe <br/>\nthat would help them see what our life looks like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read on, I think, Sandra&#39;s site an email that someone wrote to their <br/>\nfamily to clear up misconceptions and such about unschooling.  I am <br/>\nwondering if maybe I sent an email to my family discussing my views on <br/>\ndiscipline and respect they would understand where I am coming from, <br/>\nespecially since I have such a hard time confronting people in person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33661,"nextTopicId":33674}}
