As if UNSCHOOLERS are even so prevalent in Mississippi!  The numbers certainly can&#39;t account for the number of cashiers who cannot make change!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur homeschool group is up in arms, both defending their own methods and coming to the defense of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how you all have been keeping your sanity dealing with the aftermath of the GMA farce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am ready to spit nails!  I just cannot see how anyone in this JOKE of a state (education-wise) DARES to point fingers outside the public school system.  Maybe if the public schools were 6 months old and before that we were all unschooled AND showed these results, then maybe.  The way things are more people should be considering home schooling and unschooling since what we have from the gov&#39;t IS NOT WORKING.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it just amounts to not understanding nor giving enough effort to try, as well as wanting to point to something (anything) to make oneself look better, even if it is logically false.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My kid is getting D&#39;s, but at least he doesn&#39;t sit on the couch all day watching TV.  I have heard some kids do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That idiot at the gas station couldn&#39;t figure my change.  I hope he didn&#39;t graduate from the same school my kid is going to.  Oo, I heard some kids get to do whatever they want all day.  He must be one of those.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGrrr! Sorry for the rant.  I&#39;ll go try to calm down now.<br/>\n<br/>\nXAIPETE!  (Fare well, in Greek)<br/>\nKimWW</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54211,"nextTopicId":54027}}
