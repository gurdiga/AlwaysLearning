Everyone was ready to leave, but he perched himself on a rock and just gazed across the water.  It was very poignant and obvious to all that he was not looking at the river, or even the bank on the other side.  We all quietly left, knowing that he wanted that time to himself.  His dad went down to be with him, and just sat down close by and waited.  I&#39;d say he was there for almost an hour before they wordlessly walked up.  In fact, the whole thing was wordless.

And alot of the<br/>\ntime I need help to answer them.  Now that we&#39;re unschooling, I am keeping a<br/>\nquestion pad--because so many questions come up when we are too far away<br/>\nfrom a resource for answers (walks in nature).  with my now 9 year old (she<br/>\nwill be turning 10 in a week)  I can really relate to your feeling a need to<br/>\n&quot;strew&quot; in different ways, I too need to think more about what might<br/>\ninterest her, and find myself wanting to get her out more into the wide<br/>\nworld--and she is asking to go places much more than she used to.  With my<br/>\nschooled children this was not so noticeable because they already had to be<br/>\nout of the house every day so staying home was a luxury.<br/>\nso yes, I find myself really wanting to explore the world more, so it is<br/>\nalso a time for me to shift gears and deepen our relationship in a more<br/>\nphysical Go out there and Explore way as well as a more intellectual,<br/>\nphilosophical and scientific (physics fascinates her) way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this age exciting, stimulating and really extremely gratifying as<br/>\nthey are still my &quot;little child&quot; but also are moving to become my<br/>\nside-by-side friend to talk with and explore the world.<br/>\nhope that meets your need for shared realities :o)<br/>\nxxxmelissa<br/>\nin italy<br/>\nmamma di 7<br/>\n-- <br/>\nlucia almost 23yr, lidia 19.5yr, matteo 15.25yr, raffaele 12.5yr,<br/>\nelena shanti 9.75yr, giacomo leo 6.75yr and gioele 4.5y<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is a Place beyond Rightness and Wrongness -- let us meet There.&quot;<br/>\n §Rumi<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.nontogliermiilsorriso.org<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/\">http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 9 year olds/kids in transition","postDate":"1274582326","msgId":54424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwRkFDMkUwLUVGMTEtNEEzRi04OTRDLUJBNzQ3ODYzNzQxOEBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU5NDZDMzJELUU4ODEtNDk1My1CRkMzLTlBRUNEODU0OEFFRUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDU5NDZDMzJELUU4ODEtNDk1My1CRkMzLTlBRUNEODU0OEFFRUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54422,"nextInTopic":54441,"prevInTime":54423,"nextInTime":54425,"topicId":54422,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra said the beginning and end of Deb s quote wasn t clear; I m not sure why, it s clear in mine even after coming through the list, but e-mail can be like","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1978601605\">Sandra said the beginning and end of Deb&#39;s quote wasn&#39;t clear; I&#39;m not sure why, it&#39;s clear in mine even after coming through the list, but e-mail can be like that.
