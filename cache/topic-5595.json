When it&#39;s our time to go into the<br/>\ntheater, some of the kids have fun &quot;lining up&quot; most of them make fun of it,<br/>\nand we take our seats without much supervision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterward, I am often leading tours backstage for the homeschoolers.  So our<br/>\ngroup has to wait for the House to clear, and for the stage crew to make it<br/>\nsafe enough for the tour.  So we chat about the show and answer questions<br/>\nwhile we watch the school kids march out to their buses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contrast between the groups is quite profound.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Almost without exception, members of the House staff talk to me afterward<br/>\nabout how polite, courteous, and pleasant my group had been.

Dana was in the pool and<br/>\nI was in the hallway watching.  Down the steps comes a (school)teacher<br/>\nfollowed by at least 30 children age 6 or 7.  Teacher instructed the<br/>\nchildren to MARCH, and was saying left, left, left right left.  I turned<br/>\naround in amazement, actually I was appalled.  The children were not allowed<br/>\nto talk, touch or stop and watch the kids in the pool, just march to their<br/>\nbus.  I was sad.  Dana is part of a homeschool gym/swim thingie at the YMCA<br/>\non tuesdays.  They treat the kids so differently.  No parent marches them<br/>\nupstairs to the gym for the first hour, no one directs the kids to their<br/>\nparents(or not, the olders are able to do their own thing) after gym to get<br/>\nready for swim - they just let our kids go - which I LOVE.  The kids range<br/>\nin age from 5 to 13.  If a little has to potty while they are in the gym,<br/>\none of the instructors will bring them downstairs IF the child requests<br/>\nassistance, if not the kids can do what they need to do by themselves.  The<br/>\nway the children do things together makes me feel so happy for Dana.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we do park day or other outings, we seem to automatically huddle<br/>\ntogether until the mass hysteria of school kids pass or we pack up and end<br/>\npark play.  It is just too overwhelming to be in their presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom always says Dana could become a vegetarian no problem, that kid will<br/>\npick veggies(just about any kind) before anything else on her plate - most<br/>\ntimes she skips her meat altogether.  I always offer the meat cause just in<br/>\ncase she is in the mood for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe meat thing with potato layer - could it be shepards pie??
