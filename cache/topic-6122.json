The performances are held at people&#39;s houses. Once the kids even performed a puppet show for a preschool at Christmas-time. They were SO proud of themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year the kids will be performing 3 plays or &quot;tales&quot; scripted from The Canterbury Tales and also performing The Reluctant Dragon.<br/>\nIt should be lots of fun, but we&#39;re already approaching mid-April and it&#39;s getting to be crunch time soon! Lots of rehearsals and practices. The kids have so much fun doing these performances, though, so it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s great to record on video, too, and watch it years later.<br/>\nTomorrow we&#39;re also going to see The Reluctant Dragon peformed by our local theater company - Childsplay. They usually put on a great performance and give us great inspiration for our own little shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary Hickman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to share what our local support group has done and is currently <br/>\n  doing. We have produced several shows backyard style with the stage being a <br/>\n  porch complete with potluck afterwards. The kids made the sets, props, <br/>\n  costumes. One mom, Sue are you reading, directed in the sense that she <br/>\n  openned her house, moved the kids through rehersals and made sure all the <br/>\n  loose ends were tied. Now another mom is directing because Sue left us for <br/>\n  Texas. Some older kids do backstage work, make programs, run music, help <br/>\n  with costume changes. Our shows are great fun and the kids do everything. A <br/>\n  very positive experience, without a big boss directing. Also, the amount of <br/>\n  time the directors put in seems reasonable and they can reach out to any <br/>\n  parents for help. Generally 10 or so families participate. I&#39;d say if you <br/>\n  have the energy, go for kid produced shows. We take about 4-6 weeks to <br/>\n  reherse, then perform for families and friends. We have charged $5 per kid <br/>\n  for tapes and scripts. This next show we rented a local business which <br/>\n  musicians perform at, so the cost is up to $20.00 per kid to cover the <br/>\n  rental. We will not charge for tickets this time. We will have a &quot;real&quot; <br/>\n  stage, and seating. We will have a spontaneous talent show following to get <br/>\n  the full use of the facility.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the other side, our local community theater does very professional shows, <br/>\n  but some families find the environment too stressful. Long hours of practice <br/>\n  late into the night, rigerous rehersal schedules,have to attend all <br/>\n  practices and shows. Great shows. Different goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, we live in the city limits so roosters are out for coon protection. A <br/>\n  good idea, though.
