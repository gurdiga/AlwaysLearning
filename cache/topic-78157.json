But if your July 24 is over, or if your courageous mission not to learn has been otherwise thwarted, here y’go:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/JoyceQuiz/\">http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/JoyceQuiz/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you’re young, not much into old TV, or if you’re far from the U.S., it might be too hard, so don’t score or worry, just goof with it.
