Is his Sun Sign in Virgo?  As you are probably aware there are<br/>\nSun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and<br/>\nNorth and South Node to take into consideration when you are looking at a<br/>\nhuman beings charts. <br/>\n<br/>\nZak has his first 4 planets I Virgo.  So he&#39;s very Virgo like.  You need to<br/>\nhave at least 4 planets in a sign in order to be considered &quot;that sign&quot;.<br/>\nThe majority of people are a combination.  Although you do get people who<br/>\nare very dominant in one sign.  With Zak having so much Virgo (I&#39;m also a<br/>\nVirgo Sun, Mercury, Venus & Pluto with an Aquarius Moon) it&#39;s easier for me<br/>\nto deal with him than Steve (who only has 1 Virgo planet).  Talk, talk,<br/>\ntalk, answer, answer, answer, structure, structure, structure (they<br/>\nstructure not mine) is the key with Virgo children.  The more Virgo they<br/>\nhave in them the more talking they do.  Zak is very precise and logical and<br/>\nwill come up with solutions to problems very quickly.  For example.  Steve<br/>\nand I were playing video poker the other day on the computer and Zak wanted<br/>\nto learn how to play.  We told him this was a grown up game (not sure why we<br/>\ndid that actually) so he went into the kitchen and cut up tons of pieces of<br/>\npaper and made his own card deck (even though he has tons of real card<br/>\ndecks).  He then came to me with a piece of paper and asked me to tell him<br/>\nhow many points things were worth.... I sat in the kitchen saying to myself<br/>\n&quot;I cannot believe I&#39;m teaching my 7 year old how to play poker&quot;.  They learn<br/>\nwhat they see!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We have been having adventures with Julian, ever seeking structure.

A while <br/>\nago he developed &quot;study halls&quot; for himself, where 3 days a week he <br/>\nconcentrates for a couple hours on an academic subject: Monday: history, <br/>\nTuesday: Literature, Friday: Math. I don&#39;t even know where he heard the term <br/>\n&quot;study hall.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy role in this is I keep the days on my calendar as recurring appointments <br/>\nand tell him. He has also asked me to make recommendations about things to <br/>\nread, etc.  So I made a pile of stuff we had around the house I thought he&#39;d <br/>\nlike, and he plunged in. He spent one day going through centuries of poetry <br/>\nfrom my old Norton Anthology of English literature.  (He really liked <br/>\nColeridge.) Another day he read parts of The Joy of Mathematics, by Theoni <br/>\nPappas. He didn&#39;t do problems or anything, just read, and had a good time. <br/>\nThen on History day last week, he spent hours reading The Optimist&#39;s Guide to <br/>\nHistory and The Pessimist&#39;s Guide to History. (He&#39;s as likely to pick these <br/>\nthings up at other times too, but likes to know there are times scheduled for <br/>\nthem.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been struggling as he&#39;s been learning guitar. He forgets to practice, <br/>\nthen he gets sad because he isn&#39;t making progress as fast as he&#39;d like. He <br/>\nasked us to keep reminding him, but that felt awful to all of us, because no <br/>\nmatter what, it felt like nagging. Finally, I looked at him, so sad, and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Do you want to just schedule time every day for practice?&quot;  He looked <br/>\nat me and his face GLOWED!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he now practices right after Study Hall on days he has that scheduled, or <br/>\nright when he gets up on the other days. And when he went to his lesson the <br/>\nother day, he teacher was impressed with how well he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is not my style at all. (Is this his version of adolescent <br/>\nrebellion?) But I am so impressed at Julian&#39;s ability to find what works for <br/>\nhim. He has no desire for a curriculum, and is so good at finding things that <br/>\ninterest him. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13447,"nextTopicId":13438}}
