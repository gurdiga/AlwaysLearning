He just takes low nutritional foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t post precisely. Our &quot;eat what you take&quot; policy has more to do with<br/>\naccommodating the fact that there are 7 people in the house.  It is more of<br/>\n&quot;Are you sure you really want that? Would you like to just take half?&quot;  That<br/>\nkind of a thing in a pleasant tone when we are pretty sure that one of the<br/>\nkids isn&#39;t going to eat something and somebody else would have liked to have<br/>\nhad some.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to have lots of foster kids and these kids often came from nothing<br/>\nand to be able to have the LAST of anything was a big prize.  At times, it<br/>\nwas used to hurt others.  My little guys were even littler during those<br/>\ntimes and picked up on some of that.  Also, we are 7 people on a single<br/>\nincome.  I can&#39;t always run to the store to get more yogurts because someone<br/>\ngot the last one, took 2 bites and threw it away.  Then here is the 4yo<br/>\ncrying because she wanted yogurt.  It is just so inconsiderate and when you<br/>\nhave a bunch of little guys, consideration is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no, we don&#39;t do the &quot;You took cauliflower.  I know you&#39;ve never eaten<br/>\ncauliflower before and wanted to try it. I don&#39;t care if it is making you<br/>\ngag.  By the gods, you will eat it!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, someone posted about taking Zach snacks throughout the day.  This<br/>\nmorning I made carrot muffins with raisins and nuts.  As Zach was waking up,<br/>\nI went upstairs and told him that I made muffins for him (they were also for<br/>\neverybody else and he knew that).  He came downstairs, ate one and then made<br/>\na big glass of ovaltine with fresh goat milk.  Go figure.  I will continue<br/>\nalong this pleasant vein and see where it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16802,"nextTopicId":16944}}
