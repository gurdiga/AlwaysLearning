Zach is also a picky eater.  He<br/>\n  is picky about colors, tastes, textures, having never have had something<br/>\n  before, etc..  I offer protein bars (his sister has them for a snack during<br/>\n  her 3 hour gymnastics class) but all the flavors &quot;taste funny&quot;.  I have a<br/>\n  bowl of grapes, apples and bananas out on the table.  We have nuts out,<br/>\n  always have some kind of jerky, often have cheese cut up(although he did<br/>\n  take a small slice of cheese before dinner....but then had no dinner other<br/>\n  than a slice of cake with a huge mound of whip cream on it).  Zach simply<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t choose these things.  I will try actually taking these things to<br/>\n  Zach.  Maybe that will help him make the connection about good food and<br/>\n  &quot;warm fuzzies&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He was a real roly-poly baby but beginning about 15 months, he stayed 22 lbs<br/>\n  for almost 2 years.  Zach was adopted and his birth mother was a fashion<br/>\n  model but his birth father is a huge guy.  All of his birth siblings (there<br/>\n  are 3) appear height/weight proportionate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I truly couldn&#39;t care less about Zach being small.  His younger sister (not<br/>\n  biological) is extremely tiny, but proportionate.  She appears healthy.<br/>\n  Zach appears to be starving.  I don&#39;t think he is anorexic, just<br/>\n  malnourished.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The &quot;eat it if you take it&quot; is a generality and doesn&#39;t apply to people<br/>\n  trying new things at our house.  It has more to do with having a house full<br/>\n  of kids and sometimes people want something simply because somebody else has<br/>\n  one, not because they are hungry.  When Danny takes the last yogurt simply<br/>\n  because Marsie has one and then takes 2 bites and throws it out, it is<br/>\n  doubly hard on Michelle who comes along 10 minutes later and really wants<br/>\n  one but will have to wait until the next time I go to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t have a big issue with food  although I would like to lose about 20<br/>\n  pounds.  I was raised in a really layed back family and my mom worked so<br/>\n  food was pretty much an independent decision type of deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zach has never been diagnosed with anything.  When he stopped gaining weight<br/>\n  as a toddler, the doctor checked his growth hormone level which was fine.<br/>\n  We saw a nutritionist whose answer was to decorate Zach&#39;s food so it looked<br/>\n  like clown faces, etc..  Zach wasn&#39;t impressed.  Another family doctor<br/>\n  suggested Pediasure which Zach liked but then he completely quit eating all<br/>\n  together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zach has taken vitamins in the past until the new wore off and he refused.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do keep some, not a whole bunch, of foods with lower nutritional density<br/>\n  in the house for a couple of reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1)6 out of 7 people in the house are doing fine with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2)I don&#39;t want to make a power struggle out of this because I know I will<br/>\n  lose.  I talk with all the kids a lot about there is no BAD food.  Just that<br/>\n  over a few days period, our bodies need certain nutrients and we need to<br/>\n  make sure we feed that to our bodies so we can be healthy.  Some foods have<br/>\n  more nutrients, some have less.  I talk with Zach about how since he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  have a big appetite, when he only eats food with little nutrients, his body<br/>\n  isn&#39;t getting what it needs.  He can still have the foods he loves, just his<br/>\n  body would appreciate a &quot;booster&quot; of minerals and vitamins, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to try to keep from taking him to the doctor specifically for this<br/>\n  (lots of doctors have talked to him over the years when we were seeing them<br/>\n  about other things).

I am all for choices when they are not potentially harmful.  It&#39;s one thing to have a skinny, picky eater.  It&#39;s quite another to have a seriously underweight kid and say &quot;he needs to be able to make choices.&quot;  Obviously that tack has produced poor results in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Holly~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

It mentioned her son being seen by a doctor and a nutritionist, but did not say there were any diagnosed health conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing small for one&#39;s age and being thin are not necessarily indications of health problems.  I was the smallest person in my class all the way through elementary school.  Someone has to be the smallest.  We can only all be above average in Lake Woebegone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I liked about Ellyn Satter&#39;s book, is that she discusses the FACT that human body types vary.  Some people are thin and wiry, some are round and pudgy.  This is normal.  Children especially go through various stages as they grow and they will not always remain as they were while children.  There are some things I don&#39;t like about her book as well, especially the title &quot;how to Get Your Kid to Eat...But not Too Much.  The title sounds like the parent&#39;s goal is to &quot;get your kid to eat&quot; but if you read the book, you&#39;ll find that her point is for parents to realize and accept that they cannot control their children&#39;s eating.  She discusses the psychology of eating and shares case studies of &quot;underweight&quot; and &quot;overweight&quot; children.  She does talk about setting some limits, which I would disagree with now, but overall it is a book that can help parents learn how to allow their children to listen to their own bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Any suggestions appreciated","postDate":"1066839601","msgId":16911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjcwMWMzOThiOCRkYzhmNzc2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDIyMDAwOTE0LjM4Nzk1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0ODEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16906,"nextInTopic":16912,"prevInTime":16910,"nextInTime":16912,"topicId":16893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
