Born in Ecuador and raised in Albuquerque, NM, Judge got a <br/>\ndegree in physics at U.C. San Diego. Relocating to Texas, Judge worked as an <br/>\nengineer and also tried to forge a career as a musician, but found that animation <br/>\nwas his preferred calling. After a Dallas animation festival, Judge&#39;s 1991 short <br/>\nOffice Space was picked up by Comedy Central. His 1992 short Frog Baseball, <br/>\nfeaturing two sadistic teen cretins voiced by Judge, subsequently led to a 1993 <br/>\nMTV animated series revolving around the heavy metal-loving adolescents <br/>\nBeavis and Butthead. Anchored by the pair&#39;s witty critiques of muse on the teen boy <br/>\nculture of raging hormones, loud music, fast food, and pyromania. Despite <br/>\nfierce criticism of its overt idiocy and a 1993 scandal involving its influence <br/>\non a fire-setting viewer, Beavis and Butthead ran for several years, spawning <br/>\nlucrative merchandising and Judge&#39;s first big-screen feature, Beavis and <br/>\nButthead Do America (1996). Judge branched out into network TV in 1997 with Fox&#39;s <br/>\npopular, Emmy-nominated animated comedy series King of the Hill, featuring <br/>\nexecutive producer Judge as the voice of laconic Texas propane salesman and family <br/>\nman Hank Hill. Bringing his sweetly jaundiced view of American suburbia to <br/>\nlive-action film, Judge expanded his early short into the full-length feature <br/>\nOffice Space (1999). Humorously chronicling the myriad forms of office cubicle <br/>\nand chain restaurant hell, with visually clever detours into the suburban white <br/>\nmale affection for gangsta rap, Office Space wickedly celebrated one man&#39;s <br/>\nrevolt against 1990s corporate culture and became a small hit. Despite his <br/>\nsuccess with live action, Judge continued working primarily in animation. Along with <br/>\nhis ongoing work on King of the Hill, Judge also added his voice talents to <br/>\nthe outrageously tasteless yet smart South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut <br/>\n(1999). Judge is married and has two children. ~ Lucia Bozzola, All Movie Guide</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Good TV programs","postDate":"1060373591","msgId":16005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4MC4xZTJiYTQxYi4yYzY1NWU1N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16004,"nextInTopic":16007,"prevInTime":16004,"nextInTime":16006,"topicId":15970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/8/03 7:59:27 AM, dan@vilter.us writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-893477184\">In a message dated 8/8/03 7:59:27 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dan@...\">dan@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; For example, tonight we watched the Simpson&#39;s episode where they do Hamlet,<br/>\nJoan of Arc and Homer&#39;s Odyssey.

My boys will often head<br/>\n&gt; out and try to create things and have their own<br/>\n&gt; junkyard wars. I love the creativity it inspires. My<br/>\n&gt; fourteen year old daughter is a music buff.  My<br/>\n&gt; daughter watches, or records TRL every day. She<br/>\n&gt; watches the video clips, downloads lyrics off the<br/>\n&gt; Internet and burns cd&#39;s from Kazza. She has the top of<br/>\n&gt; all popular music collections. We have never been fans<br/>\n&gt; of reality TV.. But last season we did watch Survivor<br/>\n&gt; as a family. It made for great discussions about who<br/>\n&gt; deserved to be the last survivor and about<br/>\n&gt; ruthlessness and deceit. We discussed survivor skills<br/>\n&gt; in our own family. The show was marginal, but I really<br/>\n&gt; felt like it was a good learning project for us all.<br/>\n&gt; In the cartoon world. We love Dora the Explorer. Even<br/>\n&gt; my big kids will be walking around quoting Dora. And<br/>\n&gt; we love Rugrats. The slaughter of the language and<br/>\n&gt; usual lesson on doing the right thing and being<br/>\n&gt; honest. My daughter who was very, very shy, when she<br/>\n&gt; was five wanted  to be Angelica. I said she is the<br/>\n&gt; mean one.. Ashton thought that was great. Her power<br/>\n&gt; was a quality Ashton desired. Ashton at seven is not<br/>\n&gt; mean or shy.<br/>\n&gt; I do not know if most kids do this, but my kids pick a<br/>\n&gt; character in lots of shows we watch. &quot;I&#39;m him&quot;, They<br/>\n&gt; shout, each assigning to be a person in the story.<br/>\n&gt; And then later they play being the character from the<br/>\n&gt; show. In similar situations. I think that TV gives<br/>\n&gt; them a spark for imaginative play is great. Hope I<br/>\n&gt; have not been to long winded.

My boys will often head<br/>\nout and try to create things and have their own<br/>\njunkyard wars. I love the creativity it inspires. My<br/>\nfourteen year old daughter is a music buff.  My<br/>\ndaughter watches, or records TRL every day. She<br/>\nwatches the video clips, downloads lyrics off the<br/>\nInternet and burns cd&#39;s from Kazza. She has the top of<br/>\nall popular music collections. We have never been fans<br/>\nof reality TV.. But last season we did watch Survivor<br/>\nas a family. It made for great discussions about who<br/>\ndeserved to be the last survivor and about<br/>\nruthlessness and deceit. We discussed survivor skills<br/>\nin our own family. The show was marginal, but I really<br/>\nfelt like it was a good learning project for us all.<br/>\nIn the cartoon world. We love Dora the Explorer. Even<br/>\nmy big kids will be walking around quoting Dora. And<br/>\nwe love Rugrats. The slaughter of the language and<br/>\nusual lesson on doing the right thing and being<br/>\nhonest. My daughter who was very, very shy, when she<br/>\nwas five wanted  to be Angelica. I said she is the<br/>\nmean one.. Ashton thought that was great. Her power<br/>\nwas a quality Ashton desired. Ashton at seven is not<br/>\nmean or shy. <br/>\nI do not know if most kids do this, but my kids pick a<br/>\ncharacter in lots of shows we watch. &quot;I&#39;m him&quot;, They<br/>\nshout, each assigning to be a person in the story. <br/>\nAnd then later they play being the character from the<br/>\nshow. In similar situations. I think that TV gives<br/>\nthem a spark for imaginative play is great. Hope I<br/>\nhave not been to long winded.

I was worried a<br/>\nfew weeks ago after the Resume Writing Issue, but she seemed to recover<br/>\nwith no lasting effects. For some reason, writing notes to each other has<br/>\nbeen a big thing in the last two shows she&#39;s done. During &quot;Emperor&#39;s&quot;,<br/>\nshe and a few friends made up treasure hunts for each others, and wrote<br/>\nletters to send each otherto the next clues. During this show, she and a<br/>\nfriend have been writing notes to each other in character, and Rain has<br/>\ngone so far as to burn the edges of the paper she writes on and then<br/>\nstain it with tea, so it looks like authentic &quot;Lost Boy&quot; paper. I just<br/>\nthink it&#39;s all really cool, and it&#39;s totally kid-driven, all I&#39;ve done is<br/>\nsuggest doing the burning over the sink.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing Rain has taken up recently is email. She has a few<br/>\nfriends she writes to, and she actually checks her email almost every day<br/>\nnow. She writes fairly long emails, as far as I can tell, and likes<br/>\ngetting email back. She set up the program to spellcheck emails before<br/>\nthey go out, so she doesn&#39;t worry much about spelling when she&#39;s writing,<br/>\nand her spelling has actually improved. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little taken aback a month ago when we went back to the bay area<br/>\nfor her friend&#39;s birthday party, and all her old non-writing friends were<br/>\nnow writing long paragraphs in birthday cards... OTOH, one of the moms<br/>\nsaid she had hired a writing tutor (for her then-nine yr old). I am glad<br/>\nI didn&#39;t panic, because it&#39;s really cool to watch her tackling this on<br/>\nher own. So, on a reassurance-level, I think Lexie is doing fine...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants to take phone messages, though, I can see how making them<br/>\nlegible would be an issue. Rain still occasionally reverses a 3, although<br/>\nif she stops to think about it she knows which way they go. At 8, though,<br/>\nshe made a lot more reversals (although only numbers; she&#39;s never<br/>\nreversed letters, for some reason, except for Z). When she needed to<br/>\nwrite a number forwards, she would usually check the computer keyboard to<br/>\nsee which way they went. Maybe you could write the numbers 1 - 9 in big<br/>\nwriting and post them somewhere near the phone? Or show her some tips,<br/>\nlike reading back the number after she takes it and then fixing anything<br/>\nthat&#39;s hard to read. Or maybe you could leave a calculator near the<br/>\nphone, and she could punch the number into that when she takes the<br/>\nmessage, and then later copy it on paper? With Rain at 8, taking phone<br/>\nmessages at 8 was hard because the person talked more quickly than she<br/>\ncould write, so she would try to write quickly and it would be illegible,<br/>\nbut doing it in a calculator would be faster. What she generally ended up<br/>\ndoing was just taking names, because generally I could look on the soccer<br/>\nroster or homeschool group phone list or wherever to get the number...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] writing, again","postDate":"1060317080","msgId":15972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjOC5kOWQyNTRkLjJjNjQ4MTk4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15971,"nextInTopic":15973,"prevInTime":15971,"nextInTime":15973,"topicId":15970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/7/03 9:47:17 PM, joylyn@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1787125863\">In a message dated 8/7/03 9:47:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  But really, at <br/>\n8, shouldn&#39;t she be able to write down a phone message?
