It&#39;s like an angry, emotional reaction when one of those two people enters the room he is in, or when they try to engage with him. He doesn&#39;t say it to me, nor does he say it to other adults. After me, his dad and grandmother are the two adults he is closest to, but his relationships with both of them are a bit rocky.---</span></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"\">---But I&#39;d also like to be more proactive right now, and I&#39;m a bit stuck for practical ideas on how to facilitate nicer interactions between all of us.

This is usually after he has returned from being at work for a number of hours or even if he has been working in his office for a period of time. &nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">My daughter and her dad do generally have a warm and close connection but at the moment he enters the room after they have been apart for some period of time it does feel that his return is perceived as a threat or an intrusion. I think sometimes this might be because she feels that his return might interrupt what we are doing together and she fears that my attention will be taken away from her and focused on her dad.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">Importantly I think this particular reaction is also associated with feeling disconnected from her dad after a period of separation. I believe she does not fully understand why her dad has to go away to work and she may have some painful feelings about this. It helps for us to be mindful of her feelings around separations and returns and of finding ways to help to re-establish their connection.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">I believe it also helps to be sensitive to timings and if you can anticipate someone&#39;s arrival or return you can help prepare a child for this. If I can anticipate her dad&#39;s arrival we can make sure we have come to a good ending if we are playing a game or doing something together and we can also plan something that they might both enjoy doing together on his arrival. It could be sharing a story with him about something that she has enjoyed doing in the day, showing him something she has made or talking to him about a toy she has been playing with.</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">It can also help if she wants to talk to him on the phone while he is on his way home: anything that is meaningful to her, that she would like to share and that helps them to connect and enables her to feel more included and thought about in her dad&#39;s return. When I talk to her about this she does get excited and it changes the dynamic so that she is anticipating his return in a joyful way rather than it being experienced as a surprise or an intrusion.</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">It can also help if my husband brings home a present or something she might be interested in as a way to show that he has been thinking about her and it also introduces a sweet and thoughtful invitation to engage and to re-connect.</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">When our daughter is more relaxed and anticipating his arrival she is more open and receptive to engaging in a playful interaction with him. We play a game called &#39;Tug Of Baby&#39; where both me and her dad hold onto her and we both pull saying &#39;I want her!&#39;, &#39;No, I want her!&#39;. She really enjoys this and it always ends in giggles with a chorus of &#39;again, again, again!&#39; (our older daughter sometimes joins in as well). It could be any meaningful interaction that your child might enjoy engaging in with his dad or your mum that might help them to connect.</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">My older daughter now 8 years also went through this kind of reaction at the same age. I think when she was younger she also found it hard to understand why her dad had to work and now she is older she is more able to take see things from different perspectives. I think she also understands that it is not a personal rejection. They also spend time playing together and sharing interests but I think the difference is that now it is easier for her to feel that her dad loves her even when they are separated.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\">It might be the case that your son has different issues in the relationships with his dad and his grandmother which lead him to have some feelings of wanting to push them away. However, I do think if you are able to help them work on deepening their connection in playful ways and by engaging with your son in ways that are meaningful to him that this can help build their relationships in a positive way. It sounds like your son trusts you and you would therefore be in a good position to help to facilitate this.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><div>Lawrence Cohen describes exactly this type of scenario in his book &#39;Playful Parenting&#39; (p.56) when he talks about how he looked after his young daughter Emma while his wife went to work. On his wife&#39;s return his daughter would continue playing and would ignore her mother or if her mother came close and tried to engage with Emma she would tell her to go away.</div><div><br></div><div>They came to realise that Emma had been feeling disconnected from her mum while she had been away at work and what they both needed was some help re-connecting. They found that it did take some patience and some time for the re-connection to be established and they developed a number of playful ways to enable this to happen. It helped that Emma&#39;s parents were able to be sensitive and understand that she was rejecting her mum because of her own feelings of rejection and sadness about being separated.</div></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;line-height:normal;\"><br></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 3 year old telling adults to &quot;go away&quot;","postDate":"1430164745","msgId":75882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFODY5QjdFLUFGNzEtNDY2RC1CNUFFLTc2OEZFQjU0Nzk4N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0ODMyODEwLTg3RUQtNEI1NS04RTAxLTYxMjA2QjUyMDk1QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDVGQThCNTI4NjRCNTQ3QUZCQ0E4QUY3QTJGRjZGQzc0QENocmlzdGluZUhQPiA8OTgwMDAwODI1LjUzMjUzOTYuMTQzMDAxNTM0OTQ3NS5KYXZhTWFpbC55YWhvb0BtYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEJFNzlCRThCLTc2NkItNDMyRC05ODBDLTdDRDQyMzFBOTAxM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG1obGZsdisxbzhqNThsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDA0ODMyODEwLTg3RUQtNEI1NS04RTAxLTYxMjA2QjUyMDk1QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":75881,"nextInTopic":75883,"prevInTime":75881,"nextInTime":75883,"topicId":75867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If your goal is getting your child to understand, that will get in the way of unschooling.

I&#39;m getting some new experience. :-)   She hasn&#39;t had stability until January 2014—was with one and another relative, back and forth between her mom and grandmother (grandmother and four others in a trailer house for a while), in less-than-peaceful surroundings, until she was nearly five.  Her questions can be accusatory and irritating, and her tone of voice can be confrontational, but Keith and I keep reminding each other that it must be she heard such things while she was learning to speak, and was questioned in those tones herself.  So while we might say something, we still give her food and help her out. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be gradual, that she will become nicer.  Shaming her or withholding assistance wouldn&#39;t help.  Ignoring it wouldn&#39;t be great either, because sending her out in the world knowing others will be bristly isn&#39;t good help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/balance\">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>\nWhen someone asks &quot;When should I...&quot; or &quot;How much should I...&quot; it&#39;s not really a question we can answer simply.

Some people have lots of that, and some not so much.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But I&#39;d also like to be more proactive right now, and I&#39;m a bit stuck for practical ideas on how to facilitate nicer interactions between all of us. -=-<br/>\nMaybe be present more, and ready to turn a negative back toward positive.  Keep conversations light and toward something he&#39;s interested in, perhaps, when Granny&#39;s over to eat.  Look for things his dad can do or discuss while you&#39;re all three or four together that will enhance their connection and relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t expect things to change immediately, but if you don&#39;t start somewhere and sometime, you can expect things to get worse.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/change\">http://sandradodd.com/change</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":264331147,"authorName":"Marinella Abbondati","from":"Marinella Abbondati &lt;m.abbondati@...&gt;","profile":"marinellaa@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"3 year old telling adults to &quot;go away&quot;","postDate":"1429876955","msgId":75867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEExOUIxMDEwLTc1NkUtNDY1RC04M0FCLTkwMjlFQTdFMzg1QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75868,"prevInTime":75866,"nextInTime":75868,"topicId":75867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In another thread Sandra said: ==If the relationship is bad enough that they will say go away to an adult and then that adult thinks it s respectful to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-210147198\"><html><head></head><div><span></span></div><div><div dir=\"ltr\">In another thread Sandra said:&nbsp;<div><span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;\">==If the relationship is bad enough that they will say &quot;go away&quot; to an adult and then that adult thinks it&#39;s respectful to follow that order, the problems are different than described.==</span></div><div><br></div><div>I would love some perspective on just such a problem. My three-year-old often tells my husband and my mother to &quot;go away&quot;. It&#39;s like an angry, emotional reaction when one of those two people enters the room he is in, or when they try to engage with him. He doesn&#39;t say it to me, nor does he say it to other adults. After me, his dad and grandmother are the two adults he is closest to, but his relationships with both of them are a bit rocky.</div><div><br></div><div>His dad and grandmother are obviously both upset by this - they see it as rude and also as a hurtful rejection. It has also caused tension between us adults, both my husband and my mother expect me to be harsher than I am when he acts this way. They&#39;d like me to shout at him or take some other kind of disciplinary action. Both of them go away, feeling hurt, upset, annoyed. I will tell him calmly that it&#39;s not OK to say &quot;go away&quot; to people because it makes them feel sad. Then generally it gets left there, and the cycle repeats.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>There has been a lot of upheaval in our lives recently which has exacerbated the problem, but it&#39;s not a new thing.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>I want to help him understand that speaking to his dad or grandmother in this way is not OK, yet I also recognise that there is something unpleasant going on for him that&#39;s causing him to react in this way. I try to talk to him about it, he obviously can&#39;t yet articulate much but he says things like &quot;I didn&#39;t want daddy to talk to me&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want granny to have breakfast with us&quot; - I get the sense that their presence makes him feel insecure or threatened. It&#39;s as if he would like just to be in a bubble with me, and resents the intrusion of dad or grandma. Outside of home, he is generally sociable and will play happily and respectfully with other children and adults.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>I recognised a while ago that I am sometimes rude to my husband and my mother, so I wasn&#39;t being a good model. Maybe I was also conveying unwittingly that those two people are somehow threatening, because my son doesn&#39;t see me fighting with or being rude to anyone else. I&#39;ve been trying very hard to be nicer, sweeter, kinder, more respectful. I hope partly with time this will help my son be kinder too, and to realise that his dad and grandma are not threats.</div><div><br></div><div>But I&#39;d also like to be more proactive right now, and I&#39;m a bit stuck for practical ideas on how to facilitate nicer interactions between all of us. I would really appreciate some input. Thanks very much in advance.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Marinella</div></div>\n</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75878,"nextTopicId":75885}}
