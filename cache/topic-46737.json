I hope there can be healing between you and your friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was.  I work things through best on paper, and many pages of at least two notebooks are filled with about three weeks&#39; worth of rants, musings, etc.  When it all came together without rancor, it was very cathartic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also hope for healing.  In many ways, she has always felt like a sister to me, more so than my own.  I understand where she&#39;s been in her life - and I suspect strongly that she&#39;s modeled her parenting on how I handled Jeremiah, now nearly 8, at her son&#39;s age.  I know the damage that did to my relationship with my son (he is very large-hearted, and forgives me, but there are things that cannot be undone,  and I am very aware of that.).  It would be wonderful if my experiences could help her make the shift, sooner rather than later.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wish parents could think about how it would feel to lose a child and whether they might want back those five days a week the child ends up spending at school with paid strangers, rather than family.<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; radicalunschooling.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That really resonates with me.  Losing a child is a huge part of why we chose to homeschool, then made the shift to unschooling.  Life is precious and without guarantees.  We don&#39;t take things for granted with Miah and Lise, and we definitely don&#39;t want to miss out on all those hours, five days a week.  When I hear the school bus, I always smile, then go back to sleep, knowing it has no power over us. When I hear commercials for tutoring or changing your child&#39;s behavior, I laugh.  Life here is loud, messy, chaotic, expansive, and sometimes downright challenging.  It is also joyous, surprising, exciting, loving, deeply fulfilling, and just plain fun! W<br/>\n<br/>\ne are all here, together, living those moments, and, as time goes by, it seems I have less and less to regret, if any one of us were to die - and a lot more to treasure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback...already, I&#39;ve got more clarity than I had when I hit that send button... =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace!<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195268684,"authorName":"Shannon D.

I would have liked to have received a letter like this, too, when Jeremiah was a toddler.  We might have avoided a lot of ugliness - or, perhaps, I might just have been offended by it.

No reply, as of this time, but I really don&#39;t need one. I do hope, for the sake of her child, who often seems very anxious, that she is moved to consider it in the spirit offered.  But, if not, it was an exercise in mindfulness to work through my emotions, and to reflect on what a remarkable change unschooling has wrought in our lives.  We were a happy, loving family before...but now... Now we are a joyful bunch, excited each day to be together, and it keeps getting better and better.  My 5yo, Annalise, often says, &quot;Remember in the old days, Mommy?
