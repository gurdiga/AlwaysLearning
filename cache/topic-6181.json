He is living time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think of the deeper meanings and connotations of &quot;killing time,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;wasting time,&quot; and &quot;squandering time,&quot; it&#39;s pretty hard to apply that in the <br/>\nabsence of a big deadline, or to apply it to a family in which each day&#39;s <br/>\nhappiness is the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sure many of you will say there is no such thing as a child <br/>\nsquandering his time.  As long as there are interesting things to do, <br/>\nchildren will choose those things eventually - when they are bored.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will  NOT choose everything eventually.  They will choose the things <br/>\nthat interest them or are important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all you had was a can of lima beans and some soda crackers, and you were <br/>\nlocked in a building for a week, I bet you would eat lima beans and soda <br/>\ncrackers.  But if those things were in a pantry which was replenished weekly, <br/>\nyou might NEVER eat lima beans.  And so what???<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean to induce the desire for lima beans?  Do you think a child is <br/>\nbeing wasteful if he doesn&#39;t want every aspect of learning that the parent <br/>\ncan imagine?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If this is true, children that have been schooled may need some help <br/>\nwith direction. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey need a boost to get to the point that they themselves trust that what <br/>\nthey&#39;re learning is useful.  And the parents need to believe that too.  <br/>\nLooking for school-learning in everyday life isn&#39;t the ultimate goal.  It&#39;s <br/>\nseeing what &quot;school learning&quot; can be from the other side.  Kids will not <br/>\nspontaneously discover long division in its traditional notation.  But kids <br/>\nWILL discover how to divide somehow in their heads.  And then when they&#39;re 18 <br/>\nor whenever they see that little (artificial) arrangement of numbers and <br/>\nsymbos they will be able to understand in about ten seconds how it works.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not the notation that&#39;s primary in the real world, it&#39;s the <br/>\nunderstanding.  In school, the notation is IT and if you don&#39;t really <br/>\nunderstand the concept, people don&#39;t much care as long as you&#39;ve worked your <br/>\n30 problems (or copied them from another kid).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;m wondering if this is true for children that have been in school <br/>\nfor 6 or 7 years like mine.  I remember reading in one of Holt&#39;s <br/>\nbooks that children that have been schooled can&#39;t be left alone to <br/>\nlearn. .&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll need some deschooling, not some continuation of school-style life--IF <br/>\nyou want to unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are depressed or wish they were in school can squander their <br/>\nunschooling opportunities.  But those who are enthusiastic about unschooling <br/>\nwill sooner come to the &quot;flow zone&quot; and they need enthusiastic and trusting <br/>\nparents to help them get there!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] microscope/unschooling question","postDate":"1019227943","msgId":6293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4MS43MTAzMjEwLjI5ZjE4OTI3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6288,"nextInTopic":6298,"prevInTime":6292,"nextInTime":6294,"topicId":6181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/18/02 1:14:36 PM, leschke@islandnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-950673894\">In a message dated 4/18/02 1:14:36 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe *you* could look for sites and just bookmark them in a file for <br/>\nthe girls to look at if they get bored with their game. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI e-mail my kids links all the time.

Weve been doing it for about<br/>\n2 years now for my two youngest son&#39;s ages 11 and 13 1/2. He just thinks we<br/>\nneed to do &quot;school&quot; type learning every &quot;school day&quot;.  I have had a problem<br/>\nwith his attitude that they only need to learn on school days, and can only<br/>\nlearn by doing &quot;school stuff&quot;, even before I started leaning towards<br/>\nunschooling. I have had the kids do &quot;school&quot; at home, but if they just<br/>\nweren&#39;t in the mood, or if I didn&#39;t have time to watch over them to make<br/>\nsure they did it, I wouldn&#39;t push it. But I know that they learned things on<br/>\nthose days. But my husband would get upset and say that they were going to<br/>\nfall to far behind, and maybe we should put them back in public school<br/>\nbecause they weren&#39;t accomplishing enough at home.  My mother-in-law says<br/>\nthat I have failed at &quot;schooling&quot; the boys, and it will be to there<br/>\n&quot;ruination&quot;. Unfortunately, she has a lot of influence on my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We started with school at home, but<br/>\n&gt; gradually went more and more toward unschooling<br/>\n&gt; as I read John Holt&#39;s works and met other<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess I need to get some of Holt&#39;s books.

He thinks that if they are not<br/>\nintentionally being taught specific things, that they are not getting an<br/>\neducation. I doubt that I could get my husband to read any books.
