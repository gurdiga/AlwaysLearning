The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-434723479\">I am Anglo and grew up in an Anglo world with few interactions with ethnic<br/>\ngroups.  I think there were maybe 3 black families in the county I grew up<br/>\nin.  The Hispanics were mainly migrant workers who kept pretty much to<br/>\nthemselves.  I grew up in a family where &quot;n---er&quot; jokes were common place.<br/>\nI never agreed with it but didn&#39;t think much of it, just good old boys<br/>\ngoofing around, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I adopted my kids.  Adriane is Anglo, Zach is Anglo and Hispanic,<br/>\nMarsie is Hispanic, Danny is Hispanic and Michelle is Black/Hispanic/Anglo.<br/>\nThe first time I heard a racist comment after we got Zach, I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbreathe.  I realized, possibly for the first time, that someone really,<br/>\nREALLY did think less of him because of his genetics.  I have to say that<br/>\nstuff I hear about blacks now really scares me.  There really are people,<br/>\nlots of people not just  a few nuts in white capes, that truly think<br/>\nMichelle is less than human.  That it would be ok to hurt her or at least it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be any big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to blow off ethnic groups complaining about a joke that some<br/>\npolitician made or some black guy complaining that the police discriminated<br/>\nagainst him.  I used to think &quot;oh please, give it a rest already. Most<br/>\ncrimes are committed by blacks, so what?&quot;  Now it scares me and infuriates<br/>\nme.  Because now they aren&#39;t talking about some &quot;other&quot;, they are talking<br/>\nabout people I love.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10862,"nextTopicId":10699}}
