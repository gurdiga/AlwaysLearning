So much <br/>\nresearch can be done on the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that&#39;s happening lately is that all of a sudden she&#39;s interested in going to <br/>\nclasses, and there are some really good attempts going on around here within our <br/>\nunschooling community to get classes going that will meet the needs of the unschoolers <br/>\nas far as having fairly open structure, lots of hands on, etc..  But in observing things, I&#39;m <br/>\nrealizing that we don&#39;t need a class for any of the stuff she wants to do right now and the <br/>\nsocial component of the class is a larger factor than anything else that goes on.  I can <br/>\nhelp her to do a lot of the stuff she&#39;s interested in.  She&#39;s not interested in anything <br/>\nspecialized like a martial art or ballet at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been motivated to write about that on our unschooling discussion board, and some <br/>\npeople really aren&#39;t getting what I mean--it&#39;s kind of funny that even the unschoolers <br/>\ncan&#39;t see past the shiny allure of all the classes that are offered for kids these days.  They <br/>\nall sound great and so full of the promise to teach our kids everything they might be <br/>\nmissing.  And now they even use different language:  &quot;provide the opportunity.&quot;  Well, <br/>\nwhat parent doesn&#39;t want to do that?!?  But they still mostly boil down to a lot of <br/>\nmanagement, one adult presenting some material in some way that may or may not be <br/>\ninteresting to any one child, a timetable, etc.  They may work just fine for some, but in <br/>\nreally watching my dd, I&#39;m just not finding that they justify the expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe usually says, &quot;There was too much talking.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think the sudden interest indicates that she would like more stimulation and would <br/>\nlike me to be bringing more to her (she still actually wants to stay home a lot), but she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Mommy is boring!","postDate":"1206445416","msgId":33572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzYW9oOCs0dWd2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33575,"prevInTime":33571,"nextInTime":33573,"topicId":33572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son was at practice the other day and my husband questioned me about how much played video games.

I too, have noticed that he is<br/>\nseeming less interested in the games, but for lack of anything better<br/>\nto do he turns on the computer.  I told my husband that I thought it<br/>\nwas my fault and that I had become boring and not so spontaneous.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot very good at making like &quot;sparkly&quot; these days.  I was GREAT at it<br/>\nwhen we first started unschooling.  I don&#39;t know what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN, proving how in tune our family is, my son comes to me and says<br/>\n&quot;Mom, you know why I play video games so much?  It&#39;s because I&#39;m<br/>\nbored.  You&#39;re kind of boring.&quot;  *GASP*!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my questions are, is their anyone on here prone to<br/>\n&quot;boringness&quot;?  and how do you keep moving?  I have traditionally had a<br/>\nhabit of becoming stagnant.  ESPECIALLY in the winter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, like I said, when we were first started unschooling, things were<br/>\nwonderful!  I had more things to do and we had more fun than ever<br/>\nbefore.  When things settled down, and we became used to our new<br/>\nlifestyles, well...  mommy got boring again.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some of my own thoughts on how to fix my problem, and help my<br/>\nkids have a more interesting life but, I was looking for some outside<br/>\nadvice as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoringly yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33996,"nextTopicId":34011}}
