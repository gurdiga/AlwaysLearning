He&#39;s 90 or so, and doens&#39;t walk <br/>\nso well, but heard I was housebound and walked over to give me a CD called <br/>\nShakespeare--the Greatest Hits.  I didn&#39;t know who was at the door  until <br/>\nHarry himself came into my office.   I sat in the wheelchair and he stood in <br/>\nthe doorway, or leaned on my bookshelf, while he was here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, about the CD:<br/>\nThree songs in a row on the CD were It Was a Lover and his Lass, Edi Beo, and <br/>\nGreensleeves.  I told him the first we sing in my wednesday night music group <br/>\nwhich is starting up again next Wednesday, the second I just learned <br/>\nyesterday is on Holly&#39;s new fiddle CD (performed by me and her teacher, <br/>\nswitching parts, me on recorder), and the third I just wrote about this <br/>\nmorning, with the words of &quot;What Child is This.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said I didn&#39;t have to bring it back, that he has all those songs in other <br/>\narrangements, and it&#39;s a big monotonous as it is on this, but he thought I <br/>\nmight want to have it.  I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we talked about Lord of the Rings.  He doesn&#39;t have a DVD player or I <br/>\nwould have loaned him mine.  He was disappointed in the movie and told me <br/>\nexactly why and which scenes.  Mostly he didn&#39;t like the meeting between <br/>\nGandalf and Sauramun.  And he was right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him to try again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe talked about Christianity, of a nice Japanese Jehovah&#39;s Witness who comes <br/>\nby sometimes, about the Dead Sea Scrolls, which he said he used to buy and <br/>\nread in every new translation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about Seven Years in Tibet, which I&#39;m reading.  He told me about <br/>\nhaving been in China before the Communist takeover.  He even said &quot;God <br/>\ndamned&quot; although he covered his mouth and apologized.  We talked about <br/>\nTibetan culture and Buddhism.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI kept one of his descriptions in me word for word.  I was afraid I would <br/>\nonly remember the rubber. . .marble part, but look how much I could quote!:<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;After lights up I went up on one of the gundecks for a smoke.  It was one <br/>\nof those Pacific calms. The ship was riding like a rubber-tired dolly on a <br/>\nmarble floor, and the moon came up (and he showed with his hands so big on <br/>\nthe horizon) golden, and made a path on the water right to and up onto the <br/>\nship.  And I thought that was my yellow brick road to Oz, but I couldn&#39;t walk <br/>\non it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if he had been to Okinawa.  He hadn&#39;t, but he said he was on ship <br/>\nduring part of the Okinawan hurricane, and told me some good stories of how <br/>\nit was on stairs (ladders), how it was in the bunks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarry talks slowly, and always gets onto opera (which he did, and talked <br/>\nabout Verdi&#39;s politics for a while, and Italy&#39;s history, which I kinda zoned <br/>\nout on), but I&#39;m impressed with what he knows and his way with words.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought in light of recent discussions, some of you would find parts of <br/>\nthis interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10425,"nextTopicId":10429}}
