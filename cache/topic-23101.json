As with most<br/>\nthings in my life, unless I have experienced the proposed &quot;truth&quot; in my own<br/>\nlife, it is just another possibility. There are potential holes in most of<br/>\nhis work, and yet it still may be true. Who knows? But I&#39;m not about to<br/>\ncontrol my kids&#39; lives on this possibility. They actually choose to believe<br/>\nin Emoto&#39;s water/word work, and have talked about it a whole lot. I&#39;m glad<br/>\nthey had the freedom to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as TV watching goes, I watch sometimes till I don&#39;t feel well. I<br/>\nwatch sometimes for just a few minutes, cuz something else is more<br/>\ninteresting or pressing. Lots of times I don&#39;t watch at all. I don&#39;t like to<br/>\nwatch &quot;disturbing&quot; sex or violence, and I usually don&#39;t. I had to see all of<br/>\nit to know what works for me and what doesn&#39;t. Same for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree teenagers and one 11 yo later, they vary greatly in what they like to<br/>\nwatch, and each know what they like and what they don&#39;t because they had the<br/>\nopportunity to see whatever they wanted. Two watch mucho violent movies<br/>\nevery now and then, one doesn&#39;t watch that stuff at all (finds it boring<br/>\nactually), and one is still figuring it out. NONE of them are violent, or<br/>\neven mean to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo rules. No punishments. Just mutual respect and lots of conversations. And<br/>\nlots of light, laughter and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids WANT to feel balanced and healthy. They make choices to make them<br/>\nfeel that way. They couldn&#39;t know how to make those choices if I did it for<br/>\nthem.<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of JA Smith<br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 02, 2005 1:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] power of thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the excellent comments....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She said that when we were done, we&#39;d still be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there, still in that chair, nobody else would even KNOW what we&#39;d<br/>\nthought, and, if we wanted, we could go on as if we&#39;d never thought<br/>\nthose thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I learned that thoughts are actually THINGS that can be<br/>\nmeasured in subtle energy that causes water to change.
