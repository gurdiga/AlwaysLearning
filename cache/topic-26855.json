She had a few teens and a younger child <br/>\nwith her. I thought maybe her kids might be interested similar <br/>\nthings as my son, so i asked &quot;What do your kids like to do?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHer answer:&quot;Complain.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nummm....ok, thanks that was helpful. I had forgotten that alot of <br/>\npeople don&#39;t *like* their kids, or if they do secretly like them <br/>\nthey think its not &quot;cool&quot; in the parenting world to let anyone know. <br/>\nMeanwhile, my kid is the only one sitting with us parents, happily <br/>\ndrawing in his notebook. The other day he said &quot;I&#39;m so happy i&#39;m <br/>\nyour son. You&#39;re a great mom!&quot; I tell him all the time how glad i am <br/>\nthat he&#39;s my son. I also like to say nice things about him when he <br/>\ncan overhear me (to other people, i mean.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait for him to be a teenager. I think it will be fun. The <br/>\nlonger i have a respectful relationship with my son, the more <br/>\nbizarre it sounds when people say really rude things about their <br/>\nkids in public, to near strangers. And then the poor teens get the <br/>\nblame for being disrespectful, for not wanting to spend time with <br/>\ntheir parents, for sneaking around. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"raising kids is like...","postDate":"1156444405","msgId":26855,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEN0E1QzlCLTk3NUYtNDAyQy1CNTJELTlBMDhENUE5RUM0N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26858,"prevInTime":26854,"nextInTime":26856,"topicId":26855,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Below is part of http://sandradodd.com/notfunny and I don t know how it will come out in e-mails, but I hadn t mentioned this $5 way to light up someone s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1479354645\">Below is part of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/notfunny\">http://sandradodd.com/notfunny</a> and I don&#39;t know how  <br/>\nit will come out in e-mails, but I hadn&#39;t mentioned this $5 way to  <br/>\n&quot;light up someone&#39;s day&quot; with an &quot;all-too-true&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sign is &quot;Raising children is like being pecked to death by a  <br/>\nchicken.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone posted on a list I *was* on &quot;raising a teenager is like  <br/>\nnailing jello to a tree.&quot;  I report the outcome of that below and on  <br/>\nthe page linked above.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW MUCH HAPPIER those families could have been had they dealt  <br/>\ndirectly with one another as the actual people they were instead of  <br/>\ntaking on roles and spouting phrases they happened to have at the tip  <br/>\nof their tongue (without thinking of where those bits of pre-formated  <br/>\ndialog came from)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE my teens.

I responded to the list and said  <br/>\nsomething along the lines of what&#39;s above (but very short version),  <br/>\nand got three hateful e-mails and lost my friendship. The people on  <br/>\nthat list were almost all teachers in the public schools, in Salt  <br/>\nLake City. Some of them I know to be childless. I liked that  <br/>\nfriendship a great deal at one time, but I like my children&#39;s future  <br/>\nand my integrity much more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nï¿¼<br/>\nOn a New Mexico list for homeschoolers I created and maintained for  <br/>\nyears, someone put up a quote from e-Bay (- great source of  <br/>\nquotes- :-/) that said raising a teenager was like nailing jello to a  <br/>\ntree. I objected to it, lightly, said I wasn&#39;t having problems with  <br/>\nmy unschooled teens, and was hooted down by some people insulting me  <br/>\nand unschooling. The upshot was I gave the list to someone with  <br/>\nthicker skin and newer energy, and I quit the whole list. If on a  <br/>\nhomeschooling list it&#39;s to be fine to insult those whole people to  <br/>\nwhom we have supposedly dedicated our lives, there are problems with  <br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26848,"nextTopicId":26845}}
