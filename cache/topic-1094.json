We get<br/>\nvery detailed about the place (real or fictional).<br/>\nLike weather, foods, language, money, customs,<br/>\nreligion, animals, types of *beings*, etc. Sometimes<br/>\nwe &#39;stay&#39; in a place for a week or two (boy, can that<br/>\nget confusing - to the rest of the world!). We really<br/>\ngo for it and make the money, food (or an edible<br/>\nversion thereof), clothing (Once I walked around for a<br/>\nweek with my clothes on backwards! I&#39;m sure people<br/>\nthought I was &#39;unbalanced&#39;), decorate the house, and<br/>\nwhat ever else we can think of. It&#39;s so much fun. I<br/>\nhighly recommend it! You could get the wand thing in<br/>\nthere by waving it and reciting a *spell* before you<br/>\ngo somewhere. It might help to make it more magical to<br/>\ndo some of the prep work before you *go*.
