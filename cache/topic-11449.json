He also studied under Dr. Boyce. He gained a<br/>\nreputation as a fine organist and composer and gained membership of the<br/>\nselect Anachreonic Society. Member have included J.S.Bach, Henry Purcell and<br/>\nJames Boswell.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1780 he composed the music to the societies constitutional song. It was<br/>\nentitled &quot; To Anachreon in Heaven  &quot;. It was inspired by a 6th century Greek<br/>\npoet and was about the pleasures of wine and love.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe played as organist at the Three Choirs Festival in 1790 at Gloucester. In<br/>\n1836 he died at the age of 85.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis song became popular in England and America. During the war of 1812, the<br/>\nBritish fleet attacked Fort Mchenry which protected Baltimore. Frances Scott<br/>\nKey was aboard a British war ship trying to get the release of an American<br/>\nprisoner. He was held so that he could not pass on any warning about the<br/>\nattack. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the sun rose next morning he notice the Stars and Stripes was still<br/>\nflying.
