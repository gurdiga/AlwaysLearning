This morning he and<br/>\nMax (with Steve) went for a playdate at my friend Hilarys&#39;.  She had 3 boys,<br/>\nso with 5 of them playing and screaming and running around Steve said it was<br/>\nwonderful to see them all together.  Hilary decided to join us this<br/>\nafternoon with her 3 boys at the Homeschooling Skating Afternoon.  They all<br/>\nhad such a good time.  Steve had booked the boys to go to JW Tumbles for 4<br/>\nhours where they played on all the jungle gym equipment, watched Chicken<br/>\nRun, had pizza, played games and generally had a great time.  Steve and I<br/>\nwent out to a quiet grown up dinner and to the movies to see Phone Booth<br/>\n(which by the way is an excellent movie).. On the way home we rolled all the<br/>\nwindows down in the car and turned the music up loud (remember it&#39;s AZ we<br/>\nlive in so it&#39;s about 65 degrees at night).. Zak heard the song from the<br/>\nmovie Spirit &quot;I&#39;m already there&quot; and we all sat in the garage in the front<br/>\nseat with the volume up extra loud and sang the song.  The boys went<br/>\nstraight to bed and Steve and I are checking out e-mails.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great day they had. and us too..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13492,"nextTopicId":13498}}
