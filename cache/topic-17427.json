It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>\na dog owner.  You <br/>\nfeed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>\nyour knee and <br/>\ngazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>\nbounds indoors <br/>\nwith enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>\ninto a big old <br/>\ncat.<br/>\nOh, it&#39;s terribly obnoxious, but I think they MEAN well. (Which is always one <br/>\nof the worst things you can say about somebody. You know they&#39;re $%#@$% up <br/>\nsomewhere.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point, at least, seems to be to try to understand a developmental change, <br/>\nand that it&#39;s normal. The analogy is not wonderful...but it all could be <br/>\nworse. And as insulting as it is to teenagers, I think this person has some bias <br/>\nagainst cats they should really look at.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17415,"nextTopicId":17432}}
