The <br/>\nneighbor kids, who are a few years older than all mine, have had <br/>\nfriends over in the summer and they&#39;ll run between their yard and the <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s yard between our houses, and then through out yard on to <br/>\nthe playground, with those large squirt guns in their arms. We&#39;ll <br/>\ncatch one of them sneaking through the woods waiting for the others, <br/>\nor they&#39;ll ask us if we&#39;ve seen their comrades, and I often wish I <br/>\ncould join in.
