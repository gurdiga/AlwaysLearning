Do I supply the 13yo boy with<br/>\nreal weapons? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 and 14 y.o. have had real weapons ever since we started going to SCA events. I have had to remind them to keep them in a safe place, away from the reach of younger people in the house. That&#39;s the only issue that&#39;s really come up.<br/>\nJared has left a dagger out after doing some whittling (yes, I know a dagger isn&#39;t the best choice for this, but it does work:) and I had to remind him how very serious it could be for Jalen, our 3y.o.<br/>\nBut other than that, they&#39;ve been very responsible knife/dagger owners. Besides, they look cool!<br/>\nIf you go to SCA events you&#39;ll find good deals on swords, daggers and other medieval type weapons. Ebay is another good source, and malls sometimes have stores that carry weapons. They&#39;ll need you with them to make the purchase though.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18525,"nextTopicId":18542}}
