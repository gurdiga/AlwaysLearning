Once you add money to the mix, even if the child does love the game, it changes the dynamics.

He&#39;s also done a TED Talk that I quite like: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html\">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI did a blog post about motivation and learning, based on Peter Gray&#39;s blog, Alfie Kohn&#39;s work, and Dan Pink&#39;s TED Talk. Here&#39;s a blurb:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In a very recent TED Talk, Dan Pink talks about why we have it all wrong. This fits so well with Alfie Kohn&#39;s work, Punished by Rewards. Even though Pink is primarily talking about motivation in business settings, his ideas are definitely applicable to educational settings as well. He says that an extrinsic reward/punishment (carrot/stick) model is detrimental to motivation and that true motivation requires three intrinsic components: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. And he can quote the research that proves it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving a child money for goals may seem all about reward but punishment is automatically built in. A child who doesn&#39;t score doesn&#39;t get money. That&#39;s a punishment, regardless of the &quot;good intention&quot; of the parent offering the reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nRewards for something like this takes away the intrinsic pleasure involved in sports and turns it into something quite different (and ups the pressure/stress) quite dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: motivation to achieve","postDate":"1274283901","msgId":54264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0MTExdCs2NjNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRjMwRDkzLjgwOTAyMDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":54259,"nextInTopic":54265,"prevInTime":54263,"nextInTime":54265,"topicId":54239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==professional soccer players put it into their contracts to get bonuses based on things like no goals scored against for a goalkeeper or number of assists","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1023997585\">==professional soccer players put it into their contracts to get bonuses based on things like &quot;no goals scored against&quot; for a goalkeeper or &quot;number of assists&quot; for a midfielder or &quot;goals scored&quot; for a forward. They also get bonuses for wining championships, etc.==<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes sense in relation to professional sports where the ultimate goal is profits. The more wins the team has, the more money the owner makes so the more money gets trickled down. I&#39;m not sure how it applies to parents paying their young children to play well. Sports are very important to some parents for the future of their children. They&#39;re hoping for college scholarships. They envision their 4 and 5 year olds becoming professional athletes from playing tee ball or tot soccer or baby basketball or whatever it&#39;s called. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is what makes the world go &#39;round, right? Everyone does everything for money. The only reason people work is to get paid. If you do something for a living (like raising your own children) that doesn&#39;t come with a paycheck, your work is highly undervalued. I hate that on questionnaires there&#39;s no box for stay at home parent. It&#39;s homemaker these days because that&#39;s more politically correct than housewife. I don&#39;t make homes, though. If I did I&#39;d probably be either really rich or bankrupt right now. Ok, I&#39;m going off on all kinds of tangents so I&#39;ll shut up now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] motivation to achieve","postDate":"1274276175","msgId":54274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2NEQxQkMwQzVEMzRFQjNBQjlBNjNBRjI2QjI1NUM0QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwNzkwMEU1LTA1NkMtNEYxNS04MDkzLTU5QkVBQUNEQkIyNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhzdXY0OCtqcWY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWtKVGl4aWkxRWRMWWRFN1BOa2dFUWRnMnc3T19wQS01SmttMlQ4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8RjA3OTAwRTUtMDU2Qy00RjE1LTgwOTMtNTlCRUFBQ0RCQjI1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":54273,"nextInTopic":54275,"prevInTime":54273,"nextInTime":54275,"topicId":54239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... increased performance.
