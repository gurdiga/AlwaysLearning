It&#39;s not well balanced nor well supported with scientific studies. It&#39;s blaming sugar for all these health problems without looking at the whole picture.<br/>\n <br/>\nInterestingly enough, saccharin is found in virtually every toothpaste on the market and it has been found to not only be toxic, but to aid in the formation of cavities. sigh....<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably have one of the more restricted diets in our country, I don&#39;t eat meat, no dairy and recently have had to cut wheat. All due to food sensitivities. Next on my list is to cut sugar. Do I worry about my kids eating sugar? No, not really. High amounts of any one substance is a bad idea, so it&#39;s our job to provide a lot of variety and good alternatives. I worry a lot more about the hydrogenated oil consumption in our country than I do the sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17760,"nextTopicId":17762}}
