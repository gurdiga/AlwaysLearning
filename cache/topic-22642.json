Do it in the least harsh and <br/>\nschooly way you can, so that the parts he likes about it are the &quot;most unschooling&quot; <br/>\nkinds of parts.   Read books about play and freedom, rather than about school <br/>\nand classrooms.   Sing songs about the joy of the woods, and bunnies and <br/>\nbirds, rather than about academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT on the other hand, there are some great &quot;academic&quot;/educational songs out <br/>\nthere, like the Animaniacs songs about the state capitals or the nations of <br/>\nthe world.   Unfortunately, they&#39;re not on DVD yet, but they&#39;re on VHS <br/>\n(singalong videos) and CD.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little we listened to a lot of very sweet music and still <br/>\nthose songs come up.   Holly was watching Raffi in Concert just last week.   <br/>\nShe asked me about Baby Beluga and I couldn&#39;t remember all the words or find the <br/>\nold cassette tape, but got out the video and started winding to look for it.  <br/>\n She got cranky and said just let it play, and watched the whole thing.    <br/>\nThen I found a book I had not found in the first quick search.   A picture book <br/>\nwith the lyrics which I did NOT have when the kids were little, but bought <br/>\nwithin the last year at a thrift store.   With my youngest 13, I still bought a <br/>\nRaffi picture book, and it was still put to use.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would not speak against a scheduled reading and music session.   Let him <br/>\nhave a folder of worksheets, but maybe a good thing to put in the folder <br/>\nwould be song lyrics, and you could sing from the lyrics sheets and put them back, <br/>\nand not &quot;make it a reading lesson,&quot; but make it a clear use of words on <br/>\npaper, and if you sing from the same papers a lot (or from picture books with <br/>\nlyrics), that will help with music AND reading and the material of the song too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little I would have to transcribe songs out for them, but <br/>\nnow you can lift them from lyrics sites on the internet very easily.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of books with the lyrics of a single song, illustrated, so you <br/>\nhave to turn the pages too fast sometimes for singing in rhythm, but you could <br/>\ndo one verse and then go back and look at the pictures, and then do another <br/>\nverse.    We have The Erie Canal like that, and I like the illustrations, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s the one   you really have to barrel through the pages on. &lt;g&gt;   Others <br/>\nhave several lines per page and that&#39;s easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting a little structure isn&#39;t the same as wanting school at home all day, <br/>\nand it will probably pass anyway.
