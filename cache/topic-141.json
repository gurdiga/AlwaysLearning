LOL One day we were over there, <br/>\nand Lelia  and I saw this magazine, and Lelia who just is not into math, was <br/>\nhorrified to see there was such a thing as a &quot;math magazine&quot;. It will be <br/>\ninteresting to see how she and FIL (who has doctrate in HIstroy Education and <br/>\n40 plus years as teacher) react with Quinton being unschooled. Lelia is their <br/>\ngrandaughter by adoption and was already being unschooled when they met. . . <br/>\nI am thinking Quinton will be a different story. FIL has offered several <br/>\ntimes to &quot;teach&quot; Lelia history.
