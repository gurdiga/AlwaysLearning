That goes <br/>\nwithout saying. The &quot;idea&quot; of it is, as I said, a little bit of a <br/>\nconcern to me. Even if it is more unconventional stuff than actually bad <br/>\nbehavior, I&#39;m still confessing to having a little twinge of concern over <br/>\nunschoolers being viewed as anti-social and parents as &#39;un-parents.&#39; <br/>\nMaybe it is just where I live, but I feel like I&#39;m on the defense a lot, <br/>\nthese days, over this issue of the behavior of unschooled kids and <br/>\nwhether or not their parents are being appropriately responsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it is fantastic that unschooling parents will support their <br/>\nkids when they are unconventional and want to do things that mainstream <br/>\nparents might scoff at and refuse to consider or allow. I&#39;ve definitely <br/>\nbeen one of those parents, at times. On the other hand, unschooling <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean being purposely unconventional or &quot;bad&quot; for the sake of <br/>\nbeing that way, but that&#39;s what I sometimes see sort of glorified by <br/>\nunschooling parents. Sometimes they seem to take pleasure in making <br/>\nother parents uncomfortable, for example, like it proves they are great <br/>\nunschooling parents because they let their kids do what other parents <br/>\nobject to. And sometimes those things are relatively harmless, but <br/>\nsometimes they are actually anti-social behaviors - inconsiderate, rude, <br/>\nor even hurtful or dangerous to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not objecting to your project, Joyce. Just saying it brought up this <br/>\ntwinge of concern that&#39;s been bothering me for quite a while now about <br/>\nhow unschooling seems more and more often promoted by unschoolers in <br/>\nthis particular way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean - it IS unconventional to not school our kids, of course, so <br/>\nunschoolers are nonconformists, by definition. I&#39;m maybe getting a <br/>\nlittle tired of others seeming to be so surprised that my unschooled <br/>\nkids are so well socialized and so conventional in their adult choices. <br/>\nPeople have said to me that they are surprised that my kids seem so <br/>\n&quot;normal.&quot; I&#39;ve been feeling like our unschooling credentials are <br/>\nconsidered questionable, these days, because my kids are making pretty <br/>\nconventional choices for 20-somethings. Again, I&#39;m just explaining and <br/>\nevaluating my own reaction - it is my personal reaction and might be of <br/>\ninterest to others, but I&#39;m not trying to sway Joyce to do something <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might regret sending this because if I think more about it, I might <br/>\nhave some different things to say, but I&#39;m going to send it now with the <br/>\ncaveat that it is just part of something that I&#39;m still thinking about <br/>\nand considering. Still a but mushy in my head, but there is something <br/>\nthere and I&#39;m trying to articulate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I would LOVE to have pictures of &quot;bad&quot; kids :-)","postDate":"1308163858","msgId":61590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGk9YnluQ3FUUHRITUpNPTBlK21iQStUZistbUpnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1NDhCRDU3LTY2MjktNDU0Mi04RUYwLUI5MEIxMDRGNUVDNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDgzNjk0QjI2LUI5OEEtNDI0OS1CMzkxLTIxMzhDQUIwODFBQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPDczQTgwNUI3LTBDREYtNDlBMi05QTUzLThBQjNCODQ3NjcyOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPEI4NDIwMDg3LTdBRDQtNDk1Ni04OUM1LTQ4QTAwRkY0N0ZGN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPDRERjhEOEUxLjcwNjA1MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4JPDM1NDhCRDU3LTY2MjktNDU0Mi04RUYwLUI5MEIxMDRGNUVDNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61589,"nextInTopic":61591,"prevInTime":61589,"nextInTime":61591,"topicId":61578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Would you consider stories too...

When she asked for photos of  <br/>\nwhat conventional parents might consider &quot;bad&quot; it occurred to me that  <br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; meant unusual or breaking conventional &quot;rules&quot; about what kids  <br/>\nshould do to grow up and be the people those parents want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend (actually an ex-friend) who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead at  <br/>\nan anime convention with her daughter. She wouldn&#39;t be caught dead at  <br/>\nanything her daughter likes in fact, but if it&#39;s what *she* the mother  <br/>\nwants, her girl has to go along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parents tend to separate &quot;things my kid likes to do&quot; from  <br/>\n&quot;things I want him to do.&quot;  Unschooling parents tend to encourage,  <br/>\nsupport, provide advice, and do what their kids like to do. That would  <br/>\npreclude (usually) things that are illegal or injurious to others. And  <br/>\nif those kinds of things do happen, unschooling parents help their  <br/>\nkids, they don&#39;t ignore them nor punish them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of one friend whose daughter is a master of makeup,  <br/>\ncostuming and hair coloring. Her mom supports her fully. She looks  <br/>\nawesome, but people have looked at her and think &quot;goth&quot; = &quot;bad&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;disaffected youth.&quot;  Some of her friends dress in similar ways, but  <br/>\ntheir parents definitely prefer that they didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t care less  <br/>\nor have kicked them out of the house. It&#39;s a completely different  <br/>\nmindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that some people, unschooling or otherwise, might look at  <br/>\npulling up weeds that aren&#39;t weeds as a &quot;bad&quot; thing. But there&#39;s a  <br/>\ndifference in how the parent sees and reacts to it. An unschooling  <br/>\nparent might caption such a photo &quot;Binky pulled up the hyacinths, in  <br/>\nher glee to pull weeds in the garden with me. Together, we took a look  <br/>\nat the how the roots were different and that the hyacinth had a bulb  <br/>\nand talked about how it would bloom into beautiful fragrant blossoms  <br/>\nif we put it back into the earth.&quot; A conventional parent might have a  <br/>\nfit over a child pulling out a hyacinth and shame her for that, if not  <br/>\npunish her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s what I was thinking when I read what Joyce was  <br/>\nproposing &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I would LOVE to have pictures of &quot;bad&quot; kids :-)","postDate":"1308154081","msgId":61584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRERjhEOEUxLjcwNjA1MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4NDIwMDg3LTdBRDQtNDk1Ni04OUM1LTQ4QTAwRkY0N0ZGN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDgzNjk0QjI2LUI5OEEtNDI0OS1CMzkxLTIxMzhDQUIwODFBQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDczQTgwNUI3LTBDREYtNDlBMi05QTUzLThBQjNCODQ3NjcyOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEI4NDIwMDg3LTdBRDQtNDk1Ni04OUM1LTQ4QTAwRkY0N0ZGN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61583,"nextInTopic":61586,"prevInTime":61583,"nextInTime":61585,"topicId":61578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
