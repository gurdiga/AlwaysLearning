The auction sites have<br/>\nundoubtedly been a great boon to video pirates since it looks just like a<br/>\nlegitimate purchase. There are a handful of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; videos on<br/>\neBay now, mostly from the same guy in Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI inadvvertenly bought a pirated copy of a Japanese kids&#39; show through eBay.<br/>\nThe copy, on DVD no less, is good, but the subtitling is, um,<br/>\nunconventional. I don&#39;t know if the translator had a sick sense of humor or<br/>\nif he learned English in back alleys but it&#39;s peppered with swear words.<br/>\nIt&#39;s actually pretty amusing. ;-) One of the milder examples is the<br/>\ntranslation of one of the episode titles into &quot;Kiss Ass Lipstick&quot;. It&#39;s<br/>\nabout magical lipstick that makes the wearer say nice things to whoever<br/>\n(whomever?) they&#39;re talking to. So it&#39;s an accurate translation. Just a bit<br/>\nunconventional for kids. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Hayao (not Hiyao that I think I typed before) Miyazaki film that I<br/>\nlike and is actually legitimately available is Castle of Cagliostro<br/>\n(pronounced cally-oh-stroh). It&#39;s not the same gentle quality of Kiki and<br/>\nTotoro (though you can see elements of it). There&#39;s lots that would normally<br/>\nmake me uncomfortable in a kids&#39; movie (smoking, drinking, swearing,<br/>\nleering) but I find myself smiling all the way through it and Kathryn (10)<br/>\nloves it too. It&#39;s a It Takes a Thief/James Bond theme. It&#39;s funny and goofy<br/>\nand sweet -- despite the fact that things get blown up on occasion. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JL3V/qid=1016881448/sr=1-3/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JL3V/qid=1016881448/sr=1-3/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_1_3/102-0542463-8869746<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also manga (graphic novels) by him though, except for Nausicaa<br/>\n(which is beautiful but a bit too complex visually and plotwise for my<br/>\ndaughter), they&#39;re out of print.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard about Panda!
