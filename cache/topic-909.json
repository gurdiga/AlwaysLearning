I believe that the &quot;do nots&quot; of Christianity refer to<br/>\nour policing our own behavior, not the behavior of others.  I feel it is my<br/>\njob to try to make the world a warmer place for all people, not just the<br/>\nones who live like I do.  In all of the New Testament versions I have read,<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall Jesus ever judging anyone except people who set themselves up<br/>\nas &quot;religious&quot;, rather than loving, and he was definitely &quot;yoked unequally&quot;<br/>\nwhen he dealt with humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I have stopped a friendship was when the persons behavior<br/>\nimpacted me and mine.  So I have friends who are gay, friends who are<br/>\nJewish, friends who are Pagan, friends who are divorced, friends who are<br/>\nalcoholics....I even have a pen pal in prison.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Julie for sharing this.  I, too, believe as you do.  I&#39;ve been a<br/>\nChristian since I was 14 but I can&#39;t seem to find fellow believers who<br/>\nbelieve as I do.  I can&#39;t get into the judgment thing or only fellowship<br/>\nwith my own kind thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t attend church because I can&#39;t find one that meets my needs.  I, too,<br/>\nhave gay friends (I am of the firm belief it is a biological thing, not a<br/>\nchoice), pagan friends, wiccan friends, atheists, etc.  We all seem to<br/>\nrespect each others beliefs and are ok with that.  I want my kids to respect<br/>\nothers who are different, as well.  If either my daughter or son turns out<br/>\nto be gay (pretty sure daughter is not) it won&#39;t matter in the least (except<br/>\nfor society and the way they will be treated/judged, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one with these beliefs!<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet, mom to Caroline, 7, and Thomas, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":907,"nextTopicId":897}}
