Yesterday was just one of those days where I was having a lot of old conversations in my head and having a lot of doubt.  I get passion and being so into something that you don&#39;t want to stop.  I do it with knitting. &quot;5 more rows and I&#39;ll stop&quot; easily turns into 20 rows past and I still haven&#39;t stopped.  The only difference is no one is looking at me thinking I should stop and eat, drink and pee because everyone in the house trusts I will do those things when I need to.  I was just looking at him with a lot of doubt and negativity and worry yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game kept freezing up and we&#39;re in desperate need of good snacks (ding, ding ding! we had nothing he wanted) so we went to the store and he picked out a bag of pecans.  When we came home he ate the whole bag and a big glass of apple juice.  He was hungry and thirsty then so he ate and drank.  We talked and played until dad come home and was able to fix the game.  It all worked out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;hmbpie&quot; &lt;heatherpie@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;No food has been had, no drink, no bathroom breaks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you putting snacks and drinks right at his elbow? &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Back before I had kids I would do that, quilting - forget to eat or drink, be quilting with my legs crossed because I needed to pee soooooo bad, but didn&#39;t want to stop.

Dan&#39;s son Matthew is a friend of my son Trayton.  Matthew is a few years older.  At the conference Dan refers to in the link above, Trayton (then almost 9) was thrilled to go to their video game session and came back so excited. Later Matthew who was about 12 at the time asked me if he could talk with me.  I was so taken with his sweet and confident demeanor.  He told me about how much he loved gaming and how important that part of his life was to him.  He asked me why I restricted Trayton&#39;s game time (restrictions were still in full force at our house back then)  And I explained to him my concerns.  He suggested that some of Tray&#39;s frustration and outbursts might be due to the fact that he was working against the time restrictions I set up and that being on a clock like that would make the games even harder and more frustrating.   He was far too polite to point out that Tray probably was blaming *me* for those feelings of frustration and that it was putting an unnecessary wedge in our relationship.  But his words, so amazingly mature and thoughtful for anyone, (especially a 12 year old) started me thinking on this path and that was what led to lifting the game restrictions at our house.  I figured my fears must be misplaced if the compassionate, smart,thoughtful kid who had just come and talked to me was a gamer with no (artificial) restrictions on his gaming.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Woe Is Me","postDate":"1289961038","msgId":58137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGOEJENTlDLTA0MEMtNDVCMi05REQyLTMyNTMwNkZBQkFBNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlidWxucSt0cnYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlidWxucSt0cnYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58135,"nextInTopic":58139,"prevInTime":58136,"nextInTime":58138,"topicId":58135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- That was a high.

I want to go to park day.  I want to be in the sun and talk to other people and play in the sand. Sigh.  Austin wants to play Web of Shadows.  I don&#39;t blame him.  He&#39;s been waiting for it for about two weeks and has talked about it every day since we put it in our queue.  I know that feeling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having a lot of old conversations in my head right now because of what I am seeing.  No food has been had, no drink, no bathroom breaks and I am being lashed out at because the game is hard and new and he&#39;s frustrated.  I want to add &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;thirsty&quot; to that list because I know I get irritable if I am hungry and thirsty.  Maybe he&#39;s not.  Maybe he&#39;s just frustrated at the game.  I am having a hard time going from being snapped at to being invited to watch and being happy about it.  Maybe I&#39;m talking too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix months ago and I would have said &quot;too bad we&#39;re going to the park&quot;.  That thought hasn&#39;t even crossed my mind so I guess that&#39;s a step in the right direction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this a week ago to post but haven&#39;t gotten around to editing it so I could post it:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I wanted to make a point about video games in the house. We had strict controls on video game time before we found unschooling.  When I was cooking dinner was the only time during the day that he could play. It was the first control we let go of and it was HARD! Oh my gosh was it hard!  He played video games almost exclusively at first but lately he&#39;ll stop and ask me to play action figures with him or do some of our science experiment stuff with him or bake pumpkin bread with him, play Legos or action figured.  He&#39;ll even just come over and talk to me.  On my side I can now see how much he loves to play them and it gives him great joy to accomplish the tasks in them.  He feels so good about himself when he finishes a level.  I can sit down with him and play along or offer support and ideas when asked or just sit down and be present with him and I can see it has helped our relationship.  We just joined Game Fly (I never would have guessed in a million years I would do such a thing) and got Star Wars Forced Unleashed II last night (awesome game!).  I would have thought this game was way above his skill level (I won&#39;t even go into the rating) but he loves it! He asked me to sit with him last night while he fought a boss and together we were able to beat him.  I was shocked and amazed! It looked so hard but he persisted and defeated the boss and was so proud of himself afterward.  I almost cried when I saw the look of pride on his face. (OK I did a little) So now I can watch him play video games and not see a zombie or someone who is veg&#39;ing out or hypnotized.  I see determination and problem solving and passion and joy and happiness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a high.  Now I feel low.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58146,"nextTopicId":58155}}
