To me a foundational part of unschooling is<br/>\nallowing the blossom to unfold in its own time. This sounds like an arborist<br/>\nunfolding a blossom which feels like more about serving the arborist&#39;s needs<br/>\nthan the blossom&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a pretty good cook but I don&#39;t cook often. Some would look at me and<br/>\nprobably say I&#39;m lazy. I might even call myself lazy sometimes. But more<br/>\noften I&#39;d say the trouble involved in cooking the way I like isn&#39;t worth<br/>\ngiving up other things that are more interesting and more satisfying for me.<br/>\nAnd I know I&#39;d resent it if my husband saw cooking potential in me and<br/>\ndecided I needed classes and books and all sorts of other things to help me<br/>\nreach my cooking potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense? How would it be different for a child?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not sure how this fits in with the unschooling philosophy. It seems<br/>\nto be ignoring an essential aspect, like ignoring the part about eating<br/>\nvegetables in vegetarianism! ;-) I guess I might see it as Accelerated<br/>\nInterest-led Learning, but accelerated and unschooling seem to me to<br/>\ncontradict each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Many children and adults<br/>\n&gt; have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited<br/>\n&gt; resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from<br/>\n&gt; pursuing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think getting around limited resources is just part of homeschooling. We<br/>\nhelp the kids get what they need. I don&#39;t see unschooling handicapping<br/>\nchildren&#39;s access to resources. Getting them access to resources is a part<br/>\nof unschooling. Unless I&#39;m not understanding what you&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is especially important for children who are<br/>\n&gt; Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; allows them to reach their potentials.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There was a lengthy discussion recently about being gifted on the<br/>\nUnschooling.com message boards. There wasn&#39;t a single person who was<br/>\nidentified as gifted as a child who said they appreciated having the<br/>\npressure to perform to their potential. They all felt they were being asked<br/>\nto meet external milestones and move in directions others wanted them to<br/>\napply their talents in rather than being able to develop who they were. They<br/>\nfelt they were moved in the direction of their talents rather than being<br/>\nalowed to move in the direction of their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m good at math -- got a degree in electical engineering --, good at<br/>\ndrawing, writing, science, computers. Others looking at those skills would<br/>\nhave very definite ideas about what I should be doing. But I&#39;d bet they<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t match what I *enjoy* doing with my life! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do you avoid confusing what you want for your children with what they<br/>\nwant for themselves? That&#39;s been one of the hard parts of unschooling for<br/>\nme: realizing that my seemingly reasonable goals for my daughter hamper her<br/>\ngoals for herself. And what it&#39;s taken me a long time to come to grips with<br/>\nis that it&#39;s the journey that counts, not the destination. In life, no<br/>\nmatter how goal oriented we are, we never really seem to &quot;get there.&quot; We&#39;re<br/>\nalways on the path, not enjoying the path because we&#39;re tying to get<br/>\nsomewhere. But we never get there!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of how offbeat the path is that my daughter chooses, she&#39;ll be on<br/>\nthe path she wants to be on. Where she goes on that path -- or paths -- I&#39;m<br/>\ncoming to see, isn&#39;t so important as enjoying being on the path and being<br/>\nable to go at whatever pace suits her and having the freedom to divert off<br/>\nonto another path if she stumbles on something more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, to me that&#39;s unschooling. It&#39;s what John Holt discussed in his books.<br/>\nThis &quot;accelerated&quot; unschooling seems to be about deciding some paths are<br/>\nmore important than others and channeling the children along those paths and<br/>\ndetermining what&#39;s an optimal pace for them. That&#39;s pretty much what I<br/>\nwanted to avoid by not sending my daughter to school!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless theres&#39;s something about this I&#39;m not understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Presently he expresses<br/>\n&gt; interest in very little, so we are remedially exposing him to many areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Though I&#39;ve seen plenty of kids who express little interest in things adults<br/>\ncan brag to the neightbors about, I&#39;ve never seen a kid who is interested in<br/>\nvery little! ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found truly astounding is the areas that seemingly nonsensical<br/>\n&quot;waste of time&quot; interests like Pokemon, cartoons and video games have opened<br/>\nup for my daughter. They are sort of like entryways to the rest of the world<br/>\nfor her. She may not pursue them to the depth that would satisfy me, but if<br/>\nshe&#39;s left with good feelings about what she did explore, then I know she<br/>\nwill return to it when it&#39;s more meaningful for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I could encourage or make her write and draw to reach what others<br/>\nmight judge as her full potential, it&#39;s by doing things in her own way at<br/>\nher own pace that is taking her into unexplored territory. She sees things<br/>\nin ways that no one else ever has.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not, of course, holding her back from more traditionaly routes. She<br/>\ntakes classes but right now it&#39;s apparently important to her to be with<br/>\nteachers who encourage kids to follow their own paths rather than do things<br/>\nthe &quot;right way&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just not seeing how &quot;full potential&quot; can ever be free from others&#39; ideas<br/>\nof whether someone else is there or not. How can I judge that my daughter&#39;s<br/>\ncomics are not at her full potential if she&#39;s doing what she wants to?<br/>\nFollowing what she wants in the way she wants in the time frame she wants<br/>\nseems to me to be essential to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29913543,"authorName":"Kate Green","from":"Kate Green &lt;karegree@...&gt;","profile":"greenuae","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;","postDate":"1030087465","msgId":8712,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMuMC42LjMyLjIwMDIwODIzMTEyNDI1LjAwN2VlOWQwQGVtaXJhdGVzLm5ldC5hZT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhiLjFjZTVlZTViLjJhOTZlMzEzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":8710,"nextInTopic":8717,"prevInTime":8711,"nextInTime":8713,"topicId":8670,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They&#39;ll be stuck <br/>\nhere for years.  Thankfully, we have plenty of sofas, so they&#39;ll be <br/>\ncomfortable at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am concerned though, to hear that you are exposing your youngest adopted <br/>\nson in many areas.  While there are some families who believe in the nudist <br/>\nor natural way of living and some people enjoy &#39;flashing&#39; others, general <br/>\nsociety frowns on such naturalism.

She provided your <br/>\ne-mail address. She mentioned that you were a Traditional Unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Traditional Unschooling, Accelerated Unschooling understands that <br/>\nchildren are best able to determine their interests and talents and gifts. <br/>\nPeople are naturally drawn to activities and topics that fit their <br/>\npersonalities<br/>\n<br/>\nAccelerated Unschooling addresses concerns that many parents have about <br/>\nTraditional Unschooling, particularly motivation. Many children and adults <br/>\nhave very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited <br/>\nresources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from <br/>\npursuing them. Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of <br/>\nthe motivation piece. This is especially important for children who are <br/>\nGifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling <br/>\nallows them to reach their potentials.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly <br/>\ndramatic. I have four children, three boys and a girl, from age 7 to 14. My <br/>\nthree oldest children are highly gifted, and since we have begun Accelerated <br/>\nUnschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness (Math <br/>\nand science, instrumental music, art, and writing). My youngest adopted son, <br/>\nwho is not Gifted, has also benefited, as he is exposed to many different <br/>\nactivities, and wastes fs exposed to <br/>\nmany things, become a genuine Accelerated Unschooler. Presently he expresses <br/>\ninterest in very little, so we are remedially exposing him to many areas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAccelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop with <br/>\nits inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has changed <br/>\nour lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more workshops, <br/>\nbut they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated <br/>\nUnschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if I can tell you more.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay Beaufort Marchant</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8699,"nextTopicId":8733}}
