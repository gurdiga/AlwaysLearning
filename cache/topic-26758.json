Can objects really *BE* &quot;evil&quot;?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI then was WATCHING TV last night and stumbled across a show that I had been<br/>\nlooking forward to seeing called &quot;Most Evil&quot; (on the Discovery Channel). <br/>\nThere is a criminologist who ranks killers on a scale from 1 to 22 (22 being<br/>\nthe most evil and disturbed).  The first show was about couple killers<br/>\n(Partners in Crime), where a few of them were dominate men who dominated the<br/>\nfemale and in turn the female committed acts to help her partner commit<br/>\nviolent heinous sex crimes and murder.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey go to a point in the show where they talked about the &quot;shock box&quot; that<br/>\nsomeone (I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have the facts on who, I didn&#39;t write it down at<br/>\nthe time) built after the Holocaust and one of the high ranking officers<br/>\nsaid in his war crimes trial that he was &quot;just doing what he was told.&quot;  He<br/>\nwanted to see just how far people would go when they were just doing what<br/>\nthey were told.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo he brings in people to do this experiment.  One as being the teacher and<br/>\none the student.  What the teacher doesn&#39;t realize is that the shock box is<br/>\nfake and that the student is an actor.  The teacher is then instructed to<br/>\nask the student to respond to a series of questions and each time the<br/>\nstudent gets them wrong they are to push a button that sends a shock to the<br/>\nstudent (the teacher cannot see the student, he can only hear him).  Each<br/>\nwrong answer brings a higher shock level.  The shock levels range from a few<br/>\nvolts up to a deadly 345 volts.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe man expected less than 1% of the people brought in to be teachers to<br/>\nactually go all the way to the end and administer 345 volts.  The actual %<br/>\nthat went to the end was 65%!  There were quite a few people that questioned<br/>\ngoing so far but were told to keep going.  They were told that they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe held responsible for their actions.  That it wouldn&#39;t be their fault.  A<br/>\nquote that this man made after the experiment was &quot;If you want to see the<br/>\nface of evil, look in the mirror.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, can *objects* actually be evil?  Money, TV, jewelry, tattoos, piercings,<br/>\nmovies, music, etc... I DON&#39;T think so.  I really believe we project onto<br/>\nthose things our fears and issues and let them take control over our lives. <br/>\nWe choose to make them evil, they are not evil in and of themselves.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd\r<br/>\nDate: 08/11/06 09:35:18\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: TV????\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n  From an article called Hide Your Books\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/hidebooks.htm\">http://www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/hidebooks.htm</a>\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSeems  that TV is only an idol to be worshipped when people want to\r<br/>\nuse that image to control people.  A Christian site personifies TV as\r<br/>\nsomething evil with a gun to your kid&#39;s face.  A Waldorf site links\r<br/>\nan article that refers to it as &quot;the almighty screen.&quot;\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThat is propaganda.  It&#39;s fear with a boogeyman.  It&#39;s not child-\r<br/>\ncentered.  It&#39;s control-centered, and fear-mongering.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAnd on a lighter note, her &quot;there was no end to the time...&quot; would be\r<br/>\na candidate for the &quot;If I Let them&quot; page <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a>\r<br/>\nif she weren&#39;t a teacher in the business of controlling kids who\r<br/>\naren&#39;t even her own.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSandra\r<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26751,"nextTopicId":2367}}
