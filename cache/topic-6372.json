These folks were training and exhibiting many varieties of <br/>\nrats, foxes, lizards, snakes, exotic cats, birds, you name it, and their <br/>\nmethods were a joy to see.  We sure had fun seeing their animal shows.  They <br/>\nall seemed to be having fun, too -- so we asked them about how they trained <br/>\nfor it.  Moorpark seemed to be the way to go.<br/>\n( &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingdesert.org/home.html&quot;\">http://www.livingdesert.org/home.html&quot;</a>&gt;The Living Desert Zoo and <br/>\nGardens Home Page&lt;/A&gt;  )<br/>\n<br/>\nMarge</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6370,"nextTopicId":6373}}
