I&#39;m going to make a huge<br/>\n&gt;&gt; platter of deviled eggs for them to take over there, but I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stay home and watch a movie with my husband and go to bed early enough<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that I&#39;ll feel good tomorrow. I&#39;m not 18 and I don&#39;t recover as quickly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; as they do from a night with no sleep. I didn&#39;t go to the midnight<br/>\n&gt;&gt; showing of the Terminator movie the other night, for the same reason.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; But I was certainly invited and welcome.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; My kids are not spoiled brats because I&#39;ve tried to be their friend.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; They hold jobs, they manage money, they make good and responsible<br/>\n&gt;&gt; decisions. We are very strongly &quot;attached by affection and esteem.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I wish I could wipe that expression out of everybody&#39;s minds and replace<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it with &quot;Be the best friend to your children that you can be.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On 5/22/2009 11:48 PM, Robyn L.
