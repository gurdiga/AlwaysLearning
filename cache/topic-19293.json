You stayed with your beliefs.  Well <br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the trick, imo, is to let it go.  You were challenged and handled it <br/>\nwell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a theory about the &#39;comfusion&#39; you&#39;re experiencing, too.  (my local <br/>\nfriends get lots of my theories so here&#39;s one for you, too!).....  When we <br/>\nexplore emotions/theories or try on a new attitude or behavior or whatever, there <br/>\nis not only a thinking change but also a bodily change.  I think the whole body <br/>\nneeds to adjusts.  So perhaps your &#39;comfusion&#39; is simply your body settling <br/>\nin to a new/different way of &#39;being&#39;..... a different way of handling <br/>\nsituations.... a different way of explaining your actions and theories..... simply a <br/>\ndifference..... so your body/mind is adjusting.....  it feels like &#39;confusion&#39; - <br/>\nmaybe conflict - but perhaps it&#39;s growth and adjustment ......<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a theory....... What&#39;s your take on what I&#39;ve said?<br/>\n<br/>\n(And, now, with my other theory of what we say to others is what we need to <br/>\nhear ourselves, I&#39;ll re-read what I&#39;ve written as a message to me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19289,"nextTopicId":19301}}
