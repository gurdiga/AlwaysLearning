Unschooling works better when it&#39;s &quot;in here&quot; (in the family, in the soul, in the relationship) than when it&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; (about &quot;the system,&quot; or belonging to a movement, or impressing other parents).  It&#39;s better when it&#39;s about one&#39;s own child, rather than the idea of  wild, &quot;free&quot; child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe radical in radical unschooling isn&#39;t fringe, opposite-of-conservative &quot;radical.&quot;  <br/>\nIt is unschooling from the roots.  It is behavior radiating out from knowledge and belief.<br/>\nIt can grow and blossom from strong roots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope someday there will be a recording available, but here&#39;s the outline of a talk I gave last year about this.
