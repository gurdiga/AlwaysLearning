When they arrived, MY opinion was that they<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; have offered a single instead of even a short stack.

Used generically to distinguish between the smooth, pasty, drier<br/>\nrefried beans and the pintos that do better in a cup/bowl than on a plate<br/>\n(unless served via slotted spoon) or any type of tortilla  for eating out of<br/>\nhand. Supposedly the addition of beer is as much to aid flatulence reduction<br/>\nas for flavor but that may have no scientific basis :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n The pot liquor reference I just made up.........visualize what one can do<br/>\nwith the liquid from any cooking.  &quot;Pot Liquor&quot;  is a traditional southern<br/>\nterm....including Appalachia and parts of lower East Coast.    In my<br/>\nchildhood it came more often from turnip greens than collards but I have<br/>\nencountered it referenced even from cooking field peas.   My uncles liked<br/>\ntheir greens in a pile on their plate with the pot liquor in a separate bowl<br/>\nfor sopping with cornbread and then drinking what was left. I was always<br/>\ntold that the vitamins and nutrients from the greens leached  into  the pot<br/>\nliquor so it shouldn&#39;t be thrown away.  I guess I was too quick to assume<br/>\njust how much blending of culinary terms has occurred with population<br/>\nmobility and the proliferation of small eating establishments &quot;everywhere&quot;.<br/>\nProbably got led astray when I heard a reference to &quot;Tex-Mex&quot;  in a<br/>\ntelevision soap set in Hartford, Connecticut!  (Although when I called a<br/>\nHartford friend to ask about it, she said that indeed the term was<br/>\nused....mostly for taco places.... but that I would probably not be<br/>\nsatisfied with any of the food obtained under that name).<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure if one gets pot liquor cooking fresh crowder peas with a few green<br/>\nhulls thrown in, or even from green beans or pole beans,  that it isn&#39;t a<br/>\nfar stretch to call the liquid from pintos (especially if drunk from a cup)<br/>\nthe same thing :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\nP.S.: I still elicit chuckles or frank stares from acquaintances when I ask<br/>\nfor &quot;light bread&quot;  or &quot;sweet milk&quot; or &quot;real&quot; ice cream or butter.

If he is a smoker make sure that he knows that it is NEVER ok to just throw a cigarette butt.  We have a big fire less than an hour away that is just now, after a week, getting under control, and a worse one up north.  Many of our devastating fires are caused by cigarettes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite Sands is crazy when it is windy.  Bring a light jacket or windbreaker.  The sand blows and can really pelt you.  It also gets all over everything.  He will see a layer of what looks like dust after only one day, it is most likely from White Sands.  (Not sand, by the way, it is Gypsum, a crystal formed at Lake Lucero (by the mountain) when the water evaporates.)  Sandra mentioned a drive through tour, if he has time it is worth it.  No place like it in the world.  It is illegal to take the sand, but it gets in your shoes and everywhere, I am sure that if he got out and walked in it a little would come home to the kids whether he likes it or not.  &lt;g&gt; It is easy to get disoriented in the dunes though, so be careful about walking too far from vehicles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is going to be out at night, he may want a sweatshirt or a jacket.  It really does get cold in the desert at night especially if it is hot and clear during the day.  My son goes out to our local dirt race track (cars) on Friday nights, and I send him with a long-sleeve t-shirt under a regular t-shirt, a warm hat, and a warm coat.  Layering is good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTell him that it is important to always have with him water and sunglasses, and a hat if he is going to be outside at all.  The sunglasses are important, your eyes really can get burned, especially if you are not used to it.  And if he is going to be working outside, sunscreen!  Really, water and sunglasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he staying in El Paso or on base?  I don&#39;t know much about the facilities on the base, I am sure that there are restaurants.  El Paso isn&#39;t bad, I would get a map or check out mapquest and stay near the highways.  I don&#39;t know where you are from, but we consider it a big city, and it has all of the big city stuff that we expect.    I would ask at the hotel about a good mexican restaurant nearby to try.  Tell him to be careful if he seems to be heading into Juarez, watch the highway signs.  Once you get going that direction there is really only one turnaround and lines to come back are LOOONG!  If he really wants to see it he can drive along the river on our side and look across.  Makes me feel thankful for all that I have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he makes it to Alamogordo, Margo&#39;s is a good mexican restaurant right off of the main road (highway turns into White Sands Blvd.), it is on First Street right in front of Wal-Mart.  Si Senor is pretty good too, it is on White Sands Blvd further north towards our little tiny mall, as is Blakes Lotaburger, which Sandra mentioned.  Both are just south of the School for the Blind, which you cannot miss, it is a huge green campus.  If he is a burger eater the green chile cheeseburger at Blakes is a must-try.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs was mentioned, if the chile is too hot sour cream is really a big help!  And tortillas.  You can also usually ask to have your chile on the side.  By the way, chile is not the same as chili!  Chile is a vegetable, chili is a spicy meat or meat and beans dish.  In many places the red chile will be hotter than the green, but that is not always true!  They have very different tastes, some love both, some are very particular about having one or the other.  I like both, but tend to lean towards green.  Huevos Rancheros is usually red, and is an awesome breakfast.  A trip to the southwest really isn&#39;t complete without at least trying the local cuisine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a little rocket museum on the base at White Sands, one in Las Cruces (right on highway 70), and our bigger one in Alamogordo that Sandra mentioned.  If he is into that it is really worth a trip.  Then there is the little train museum on White Sands Blvd, a little petroglyph site about 30 minutes away, Friday night car racing, lots of nearby mountain activities, lots of places to hike,  we have a new nice movie theater... let me know if he will have time on his hands and I will send a longer list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, driving in New Mexico is different than a lot of places.  We have long, deserted spaces between towns.  Make sure that he has extra water in the car, a fullish tank of gas, and we always take along a blanket.  It is only an hour from El Paso to Alamogordo, then less than a half hour to White Sands, but that is an hour plus of almost empty desert!  The highway is nice now though.    <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if there are any questions that he has, I am kind of rambling!  I can give you/him my number too if you want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and water and sunglasses!  Really!  By the time you notice that you are getting dehydrated you are REALLY dehydrated!  And a headache in the desert is a sure sign of dehydration.  Start drinking water early.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Traveling to New Mexico","postDate":"1210267415","msgId":34698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2NzI2MjI2LTUzMkUtNDNCQi1BRjQ0LTc0MzEwMDFEQzcyREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5Y2ExYmJhMDgwNTA4MDUyMHE0MzczNGIyMWo5ZWU4YmUyYWRlN2U3MTY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ2dGZ0Nis0cjc4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QzU1RDBCMjctMjZCNS00RUMxLUI2OUMtM0VGNjRFRTVBOTVEQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8YzljYTFiYmEwODA1MDgwNTIwcTQzNzM0YjIxajllZThiZTJhZGU3ZTcxNjVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34694,"nextInTopic":34701,"prevInTime":34697,"nextInTime":34699,"topicId":34680,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Dairy helps.
