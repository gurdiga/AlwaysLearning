I was thinking about it in relation to the nastiness of the &#39;useless&#39; feedback Sandra posted earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so grateful to have found unschooling and this list while my kids are still young enough for me to undo the damage of some of the fear-based controlling I did around food and tv in particular. Actually, control generally, feeling I had to be in charge, boundaries, consistency, or everything would be ruined.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much fear and worry that things would go wrong, that she&#39;d never eat, or sleep or use the toilet *properly* unless I did everything perfectly with no compromises and no retreating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading on gentle parenting forums, &#39;don&#39;t worry about it, s/he&#39;ll do it when s/he&#39;s ready, no point in pushing it.&#39; and feeling so superior.  Yes, I would think, but you haven&#39;t seen the kids that I&#39;ve seen who won&#39;t eat anything but purees at five, or who are still in nappies at four. You have to get on this stuff, or look what might happen!  I was also very into independence, natural/logical consequences and NVC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I think, so what?  Is my child happy, healthy, connected?  Are we moving towards partnership?  Are we having fun right now, at this moment?  Am I treating my children as well or better as I would treat my husband or my friend? If yes, great.  If not, change, make a different choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have a long way to go.  Still plenty of fear and irritation and bad choices made.  But less.  Every day a bit less.  And for that I thank Sandra, Joyce, Schulyer, Meredith, Connie, Brie, Pam and all the wise women on this list.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know the people personally, but a homeschooling mom posted on facebook that it was eleven years to the day since she first knew ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just realised it&#39;s exactly 11 years since we found out about home education being a legal, viable alternative to school- found out on a Friday....
