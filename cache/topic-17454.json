A spark of recognition or realization and it&#39;s LEARNED.  Real brain <br/>\nconnections.  So tell her not to think a teensy session is less valuable than <br/>\na long session.  Lots of little ones are probably better than long focussed <br/>\nsessions anyway.  And he&#39;ll need time to process and play with what he&#39;s <br/>\nlearned.   <br/>\n<br/>\nRemind her that when a child has had an intellectually or emotionally <br/>\nstimulating day he&#39;ll probably sleep extral long and extra hard, and that too is <br/>\nprocessing time.

Since <br/>\nyou&#39;re so into home schooling I&#39;m sure you have lots of resources.  <br/>\nWould you mind taking a few minutes and helping me find some.  I know <br/>\nevery mother says this but I swear Noah&#39;s IQ must be huge.  I taught <br/>\nhim how to count to ten already, and now we&#39;re working on the <br/>\nalphabet (after just a few sessions he&#39;s already showing some <br/>\nmemorization).  He&#39;s also recognizing most of his colors and all of <br/>\nhis body parts even the hard ones.  I just feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>\neverything so quickly that I don&#39;t want to slow down.  He&#39;s really <br/>\nenjoying it so where can I go from here.  Are there books that I can <br/>\nread to help me deal with an exceptional child?  My mother says I&#39;m <br/>\npushing him too hard but I feel like he&#39;s pushing me to learn new <br/>\nthings.  John agrees with me that Luke has a true love of learning.  <br/>\nWhat do you think can you push a kid too hard when they are the <br/>\ninstigator?  If you can just point me in the direction of some <br/>\nliterature I&#39;ll be sure to read it.  <br/>\nThanks a million,<br/>\nShauna<br/>\nHey are you still home schooling?  I was just curious to know if this <br/>\nwas a permanent situation or what.  Obviously if you are it&#39;s working <br/>\nwell for you but let me know because I&#39;m curious how it works with <br/>\ntwo kids of different ages<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a couple of reactions to this. First, that this woman is totally, <br/>\nhead-over-heels, in love with her child. She looks at him with awe and love. How <br/>\ncool is that?!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 17 months old, playing these games with him are games to him. Maybe <br/>\nthey&#39;ll pan out in that he&#39;ll read early or something. Maybe not. Seems the goal is <br/>\nto help her stay awesomely in love with her kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell her that if she wants him to keep love learning that she should read to <br/>\nhim and play as many games with him as they like to do together, but that she <br/>\nhas to be careful about pushing him beyond that. Tell her that if it stops <br/>\nbeing fun for him, he&#39;ll stop being so hungry for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell her that one of the things that seems to squelch children&#39;s love of <br/>\nlearning is to be yelled at, shamed, punished. Suggest she try to be as positive <br/>\nand supportive as possible. That she also needs not to worry so much about <br/>\nacademics as to help him nurture ALL his interests and talents, because he <br/>\nprobably will have lots.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, tell her that with such an exceptional child, she should <br/>\ndefinitely homeschool, preferably unschool. Then suggest a copy of Holt (Oh, you <br/>\nalready did that!) or some other unschooling book. I also like Please Touch, by <br/>\nSusan Striker (who also did the Anti-Coloring Books). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay (even sweet) that she feels that her son is exceptional. You can <br/>\nhelp her keep feeling that way even if he&#39;s actually a bit dim &gt;eg&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17449,"nextTopicId":17455}}
