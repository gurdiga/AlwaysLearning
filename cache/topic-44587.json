The other girl is someone Marty had a great  <br/>\ncrush on, and then Bo had a relationship with for a while.  The other  <br/>\ntwo girls had their own special relationship for a while; offered  <br/>\nMarty a threesome he turned down.

So even without the logistics of pricing and displaying  <br/>\ntheir sale items and making sure there were signs out and they had  <br/>\nsnacks, the odds of these three young women getting along cheerily and  <br/>\nwithout verbal incident for three long, hot days was nothing to bet  <br/>\non.

I don&#39;t get this &quot;seemed like a threat&quot; thing.   If he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nbe quiet, it wasn&#39;t okay for him to still be there talking loudly.    <br/>\nNot okay.   If the deal is sleep or talk as loud as you want, then  <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t threaten to hit him.  You&#39;re telling him what EVERYone  <br/>\nthere knew and was abiding by.   Sleep or quiet.   Anyone who stays  <br/>\nawake howling and yelling when others are trying to sleep is being a  <br/>\nprick.   So there&#39;s the crazy end of it--purposely yelling and firing  <br/>\nguns or fireworks or whatever when others are camping.   If a child  <br/>\nAND a mother can&#39;t be quiet, it&#39;s not as loud as guns and howling at  <br/>\nthe moon, but it&#39;s closer to that than it is to sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But I felt like my &quot;solution&quot; sounded like<br/>\na threat.

That&#39;s one reason I  <br/>\nthink it&#39;s bad to send kids to their rooms as punishment, because it  <br/>\nmakes them want to be places other than their rooms.   Same with  <br/>\nbeds.  If kids &quot;have to&quot; go to bed, theyll see not-bed as joy, as  <br/>\nreward.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for kids who haven&#39;t ever been punished with bed, it&#39;s not a &quot;time  <br/>\nout&quot; place, and it&#39;s not a &quot;you&#39;re here because you were bad&quot; place.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s a soft warm place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":381959449,"authorName":"kelly_sturman","from":"&quot;kelly_sturman&quot; &lt;conspicuousfamily@...&gt;","profile":"kelly_sturman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Guiding A Child to Be Considerate of Others?","postDate":"1241209981","msgId":44587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0Zm05dCtwOXQ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44590,"prevInTime":44586,"nextInTime":44588,"topicId":44587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, so I am thinking more about letting a child know when his behavior is not nice.

Here is an example that happened in<br/>\nour family just a few days ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne DS is VERY loud.  Always.  A la <br/>\n&quot;This is Spinal Tap,&quot; his volume knob<br/>\nis set at 11.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was 11 p.m.  We were camping,<br/>\nand I suspected that some of our neighboring<br/>\ncampers might be trying to sleep.  I *knew* that <br/>\nlocal noise ordinances were in<br/>\neffect between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gently whispered to all the children, but<br/>\nto DS in particular, &quot;People around us are <br/>\ntrying to sleep.  If we whisper, maybe we can<br/>\nkeep talking without bothering people around<br/>\nus who are trying to sleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut being loud is a habit DS has, so he&#39;d <br/>\nwhisper for a few moments, then forget and <br/>\nget loud again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt my body going tense.  I felt all sorts of <br/>\nchildhood, family of origin triggers flipping.<br/>\nI *knew* he wasn&#39;t being loud to defy me.<br/>\nBut after repeating the same message:<br/>\n&quot;Being quiet now is a way to be nice to the<br/>\nother people sharing this space...&quot; several<br/>\ntimes, I was feeling like, &quot;I am not being <br/>\nheard.&quot;  And that trigged painful childhood<br/>\nmemories of parents who really believed<br/>\n&quot;children should be seen and not heard.&quot;<br/>\nOr, more like, &quot;better if children are neither<br/>\nseen nor heard.&quot;  Anyway, I knew that my<br/>\nemotional reaction was mine, and not so<br/>\nmuch to do with DS.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the people around us who were trying<br/>\nto sleep deserved to have quiet at that hour,<br/>\nand DS was not hearing that message, no <br/>\nmatter how many times nor in how many<br/>\ndifferent ways I phrased it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I said to him, &quot;Look, we have a real<br/>\nproblem here, because you are not remembering<br/>\nto be quiet.  Let&#39;s figure out how to solve this<br/>\nproblem.  One idea I have is that tomorrow,<br/>\nwe could go to sleep earlier than we usually<br/>\ndo.  If we are asleep, we won&#39;t be noisy.  <br/>\nWhat ideas do you have?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody had any other ideas.  But DS did<br/>\nget quiet after that, and he was quiet the<br/>\nnext night with one reminder.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I felt like my &quot;solution&quot; sounded like<br/>\na threat.  I didn&#39;t mean it that way, but<br/>\nit felt that way to me, with my mother&#39;s<br/>\nvoice echoing in my head, &quot;Well, if you<br/>\ncan&#39;t be nice, you can just go to bed early.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it felt like a threat to DS, too, given that <br/>\nhe quieted down after I said it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to be a threatening parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I do better?<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Sturman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44349,"nextTopicId":44628}}
