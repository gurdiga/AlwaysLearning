I&#39;m taking a chance that maybe one of<br/>\nyou that checked out after I did at the Clarion may have picked up a bag of<br/>\nbook from FUN Books I left there. Jonathan smashed his finger in the car<br/>\ndoor as we were packing up. The bag of books would have been right there in<br/>\nfront of the check out desk. That&#39;s where I was when he came in from the<br/>\naccident. I&#39;ve called the hotel and they said it wasn&#39;t turned in. They are<br/>\nto call me if they find it. I high doubt they will. :-( I&#39;m oh so sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9835,"nextTopicId":9849}}
