Angel (the big lab/retriver mix) is <br/>\npositively in love with her - very cute -.  She follows her <br/>\neverywhere and lays down beside her when she sleeps.<br/>\nTwo of Tamzin&#39;s friends are sleeping over tonight and they&#39;ve just  <br/>\ncome into the room pushing her doll stroller with, you guessed it, <br/>\nCoconut in it.
