Probably not if they&#39;re coming from an <br/>\nUnschooling page... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you&#39;re right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the other point about it being still quite &quot;us vs. them&quot; is true too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom who sent it was having a horrible time when she had two toddlers and <br/>\nshe called me in desperation one day.  She was from Albuquerque but had moved <br/>\nto El Paso.  With her last bit of sanity, she called and asked me to find her <br/>\nsome HELP, counselling, intervention, something because she was feeling big <br/>\nviolence.  I only had Kirby then.  We had known each other for ten years at <br/>\nthat point, through the SCA and mutual friends.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI started calling around El Paso to find her a suicide hotline.<br/>\nNone.<br/>\nParenting group? <br/>\nNo.<br/>\nCounty health with counseling?<br/>\nApparently none for parenting issues.<br/>\nI ended up talking to someone in San Antonio and someone in Austin and <br/>\ngetting REALLY frustrated.  Every twenty minutes or half an hour, I&#39;d call <br/>\nher back and say &quot;Still trying.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never felt the same way about El Paso since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew there was the midwifery school there, but they knew nothing about <br/>\nissues with older kids (whoever I talked to didn&#39;t anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was pre worldwide web.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I came up with was a contact from Parents Anonymous from Arizona or <br/>\nsome where who could send her information.   So I got the national Parents <br/>\nAnonymous people who said they had ONE single correspondent there (like a <br/>\nnational member who had no local group) and they would put him in contact <br/>\nwith my friend.  So the two of them started a chapter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had to start her own club to get help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo did I, with Ceasarean Prevention.  They found me the one person in town <br/>\nwho was involved but hadn&#39;t started a local group yet.  Same deal.  Sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe friend moved to Tucson and has always worked full time, since she got out <br/>\nof high school.  Pretty much wouldn&#39;t consider otherwise, and as she is on <br/>\nher fourth very irresponsible male partner in that time (I&#39;ve known them <br/>\nall), she NEEDS to work.   Seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for her, this was huge progress, and because she reads my websites <br/>\n(ALWAYS) and tells me when a link doesn&#39;t work or whatever, I wanted to <br/>\nconsider using her contribution...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I could flag it as &quot;for beginners.&quot;<br/>\nMaybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think the advice we give newcomers is too high-level or esoteric <br/>\nfor them.  If a person is still doing a bunch of spanking/grounding/loss of <br/>\nprivelege or allowance, to say &quot;Just be with your child and respect his <br/>\nneeds&quot; will sound like &quot;poo peedity tiled on perect pooteeds&quot; or maybe &quot;WHAT, <br/>\nI&#39;ll be in time out too?
