She talks about allowance and her thought is that children should have money as soon as they are old enough to not eat it.  Then they should get a &quot;raise&quot; once they prove they need it.  She said she had 3 kids and one wanted to be paid monthly, the others weekly.  One of the older ones wanted a raise and had reasons why he would need more money.  One of the younger kids had a bunch of reasons that she didn&#39;t agree with, but he worked so hard to convince her of his need for more money that she gave him some too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were younger Friday was &quot;dollar day&quot;  They would each get a dollar to spend or save as they wish.  Then for a while money was tight and 2 dollars a week was too much for me to give them.  They understood that.  They know about how much money we make working in our family business and they know what bills we have.  They have a good understanding of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally do not like to attach money to chores around the house because then when I ask my kids to help with something they ask if they are getting paid and they only want to help out if they are getting something out of it.

My husband does most of the cooking, I do the cleaning, <br/>\nexcept for the vacuuming which my husband does. My nine year old <br/>\nkeeps the back yard play area under control (picks up fallen <br/>\nbranches, fills up the bird feeders and butterfly, squirell and bird <br/>\ndrinking bowls, removes the ever falling leaves off the trampoline, <br/>\netc) and she also puts the dishes away after my 12 year old washes <br/>\nthem. The other things we do on an as needed basis or whoever sees <br/>\nit or can do it first. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey can do whatever they want with their money, which they also use <br/>\nfor birthday & Christmas gifts. I pay for all activites, clothes, <br/>\nhaircuts, etc. I still buy stuff for them in the store if I have <br/>\nextra cash and there have been times where they&#39;ve paid for me or <br/>\ntaken me out to lunch (they LOVE doing that....they took me to <br/>\nBurger King the other day for a veggie burger and both wanted to pay <br/>\nfor it.

I figured I&#39;d give her $40 and she could take three people.  Marty <br/>\nwas going to go with her.  Then others wanted to go.   <br/>\nI gave her $60, remembering it&#39;s cheaper than a baker cake and enough food <br/>\nfor a party, and suggested maybe she could equally subsidize people or <br/>\nsomething.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo it sounds like you had kind of a party budget in your head, and you more <br/>\nor less stuck to it.  And when it wouldn&#39;t completely cover her, she chipped in <br/>\nand her friends helped out.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty similar to what we do, most of the time.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHolly&#39;s older and has more money than Abby, who&#39;s 11 and not earning anything <br/>\non her own yet, but maybe it works out about the same since the things Holly <br/>\nwants probably cost more.  So maybe it&#39;s more an issue of Abby not having a <br/>\nbig enough allowance.  She still asks me for things at the store, and I have a <br/>\nhard time drawing a line between things she should pay for, and things I <br/>\nshould.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I have issues at times with judging as frivolous or unnecessary stuff <br/>\nshe wants.  Like the other day I got annoyed with her at the store because I <br/>\ninvited her to come with me to get milk and she ended up getting excited <br/>\nthinking *we* should buy a Halloween mask that she thought would be funny for dh, <br/>\nwhen she didn&#39;t have any money.  I did catch myself afterward and said, look, <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t expecting to buy other stuff, we don&#39;t even know if dad <br/>\n*wants* to wear a mask on Halloween, why don&#39;t you ask him if he wants you to <br/>\npick something out for him and if so, we&#39;ll go back and get it.  And sure enough, <br/>\nhe saw her excitement about it and said yes, so the next day I did go back <br/>\nwith her and get it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo depending how you view it, it was either a total *waste* of money, or, <br/>\n*priceless* to see how delighted it made her to present it to dh.  (And if *was* <br/>\na pretty funny mask --- it&#39;s the top half the Elvis&#39; head.  Looks hilarious on <br/>\nhim, IF you&#39;re not focusing on how you *wasted* another $6 after spending $25 <br/>\non stuff for her own costume.)  Looking back, it was pretty dumb of me to <br/>\nthink she wasn&#39;t going to actually want anything at the store, because she nearly <br/>\nalways does.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI supposed I could&#39;ve offered her a loan.  But with loans and paybacks it&#39;s <br/>\nnot what I imagined as a system of the money belonging to everyone.  But it <br/>\nwould be an improvement over what I&#39;m doing now.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s generous when she has money and we try to be generous with her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Abby is too, really.  I mean look, the mask wasn&#39;t even for her.  But it&#39;s <br/>\nsilly that the fears come up anyway even when the evidence right in front of me <br/>\nsays otherwise.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; We never had a take-take-take phase, but we never had a very stingy- &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>parents phase either, so I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut you do have limits -- but they&#39;re natural ones, not arbitrary ones, right?<br/>\n <br/>\nPart of the reason I ask is that I was just having a conversation with a <br/>\nfriend who&#39;s trying improve her relationship with her teen son.  She&#39;s wrestling <br/>\nwith a decision of whether to grant his request for her to take him to the Led <br/>\nZeppelin concert in London (from California.)  And it *is* within their means, <br/>\nand he knows it, and reminds her of that -- which is one source of her <br/>\nconcern, I think.  She and her husband have some of the same fears I&#39;ve mentioned.  <br/>\nBut since saying yes to this would be a very new approach for her, I&#39;m <br/>\npredicting it may work the same as the unlimited tv thing.  But maybe not.  She says <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t ask for a lot.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was surprised when we went to Disneyland and kept offering Marty  <br/>\n&gt; money or souvenirs and he kept saying no thanks, and not in any kind  <br/>\n&gt; of surly or reactionary way, he was just honestly having fun without  <br/>\n&gt; the acquisition of *stuff.*   I was so surprised I wrote it up and it&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>here:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled_\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled)\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really good (and I will share it with my friend and her husband, too.) <br/>\n So when you have money and they don&#39;t, you occasionally do just hand it out. <br/>\n I cut this from there:<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think they knew if they had REALLY wanted something–a toy or a t-shirt or <br/>\nwhatever–that they could have had it. So their decisions were not made on any <br/>\nbasis except &quot;Do I really want this? Would it make my life better to have <br/>\nit?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is the place I&#39;d like to get to with Abby.  Only I worry there are a <br/>\n*whole* lot of things she&#39;d like and in her opinion would make her life better.  <br/>\nHer room is knee-deep in stuffed animals, which is fine, but it&#39;s not like <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to stop making them or new ones will cease to be cute and <br/>\nappealing.  My mother-in-law loves to buy things too, and with her it seems like a <br/>\nsymptom of a larger problem.  So maybe that&#39;s it, I worry that we&#39;ve done <br/>\nsomething wrong and made her needy for hundreds of stuffed animals. Or it&#39;s genetic, a <br/>\nshopping gene she got from Grandma that has nothing to do with me.  Or <br/>\nneither.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is more like how you describe Marty though.  He seems to take pride in <br/>\nusing his own money and not needing things from us.  But he&#39;s a year older.  <br/>\nAnd I do remember getting to that point with my own parents.
