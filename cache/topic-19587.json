I m just thinking how different life is now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1448974622\">Rain would be a fifth grader if she were in school, and she owns the<br/>\nvideo, and has memorized most of the songs... I&#39;m just thinking how<br/>\ndifferent life is now that everyone owns a VCR! <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a huge difference between seeing a musical on video and<br/>\nseeing a live show, though. Rain rented the video of Le Miz and stopped<br/>\nwatching halfway into it because she was bored (but left in on for the<br/>\nsongs), but the actual Broadway show was here fave ever. I almost never<br/>\nwatch shows on video, because it&#39;s generally such a pale imitation of the<br/>\nreal thing. I think movies are meant to be seen as movies, and shows are<br/>\nmeant to be seen live. I&#39;m not sure how that helps Joylyn - unless you<br/>\ncan take lots of field trips - but I&#39;m not sure there are many videos of<br/>\nshows that will really hold kids&#39; interest for two hours. Maybe get a<br/>\nscript and some CDs of the music?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were doing dinner and a show (Our Town) with some friends,<br/>\nincluding Rain and two other girls a little older than Rain, all active<br/>\nin local theatre and all current or former homeschoolers... we went to<br/>\nMax&#39;s Opera Cafe, where the waiters sing show tunes in between serving<br/>\ntables. We kept trying to suggest songs for our waiter to sing and he<br/>\nkept apologetically telling us that the song wasn&#39;t appropriate for their<br/>\ncrowd, which did include some old ladies and young kids... but still, it<br/>\nwas amazing how how many musicals were full of objectionable songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nInto The Woods probably wouldn&#39;t be allowed either, huh? Maybe just the<br/>\nfirst act?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with whoever said Carousel was deadly boring. Rain was in it, and<br/>\nit was a pretty good production,  and I still found it deadly boring.<br/>\nCarnival wasn&#39;t great either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Peter Pan would be fun. A lot of old stuff that isn&#39;t PC makes a<br/>\ngreat springboard for discussion, as long as you make it clear that<br/>\nyou&#39;re not showing it because you agree with all of the stereotypes. Show<br/>\nBoat might work, too, even with the &quot;Colored folks work on the<br/>\nMississippi&quot;, with the same caveats - although Joe and Queenie are<br/>\nactually two of the wisest characters in that show. There&#39;s a really old<br/>\nvideo of that that&#39;s really good, like from the 1930s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\nOn Sat, 22 May 2004 18:56:33 -0500 &quot;Nichole in Round Rock&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skhosaeviani@...\">skhosaeviani@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I first watched Hair when I was in Fifth grade, and watched about 20 <br/>\n&gt; times on HBO, when we used to call it Home Box.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nichole<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Paula Sjogerman <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 22, 2004 3:17 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Speaking of Musicals<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   on 5/22/04 11:32 AM, Nichole in Round Rock at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skhosaeviani@...\">skhosaeviani@...</a><br/>\n&gt;   wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Did anyone mention HAIR ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The original poster&#39;s question was about musicals appropriate for <br/>\n&gt; a public<br/>\n&gt;   school 6th (I think) grade.
