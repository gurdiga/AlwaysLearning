I&#39;d love to have you visit the site.  My five children have learned <br/>\nat home since 1981, when the oldest two left public school.  They all remained <br/>\nat home until entering college.  At this time Chris, who is married and has a <br/>\ndaughter, is working as an accountant.  Shawn will graduate in Dec. with a <br/>\ndegree in Theatre, and is applying for graduate school.  Devin is a journey man <br/>\nin the heating/air conditioning field.  Donika majors in music and dance at <br/>\nGrossmont Community College, and Trevor at 15 is still home.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis book covers some of the stories of our experiences.  It is written to <br/>\nprovide you mentoring support, as though I was your older sister.  I talk about <br/>\nsome of the challenges we have encountered, and some of the questions I have <br/>\nbeen asked through the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m taking advanced orders, which won&#39;t be processed until the book is ready <br/>\nto send out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cover of the book was designed by my good friend&#39;s daughter, Ashley <br/>\nParsons, who was homeschooled.  The website was created by my nephew, Steven <br/>\nPotter, who left high school out of boredom to attend technical school for <br/>\ncomputers, which he also left to run his own business.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been an amazing life experience, not only to watch my children grow to <br/>\nyoung adults, four of whom are now out in the world, but also to watch the <br/>\ngrowth of the un/homeschooling movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit the website at: www.Homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to share the site with any people or lists that you think might <br/>\nhave an interest in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nConnie Colten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16340,"nextTopicId":16342}}
