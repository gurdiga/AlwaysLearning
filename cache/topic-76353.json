I had to take a few days to really read/listen and process them but now I see the light! The trouble was with me. I had fallen into a habit of getting things done and parenting from the sidelines while they seemed engaged in an activity rather than being WITH them. &nbsp;I also was focusing too much on asking why he did X rather than understanding where he was coming from. I&#39;m sure he did feel as if I was taking the younger kids side as he told me how they were annoying him yet all I focused on was pointing out how much more (to my perspective) he was annoying them. My expectations were off too. Just because he is older or &quot;should know better&quot; doesn&#39;t give him self control or the skills to deal with his frustrations. &nbsp;<div>Over the last few days I have done better at being WITH them, playing with them (encouraging physical activity rather than telling them to calm down and be quieter cause it gets a bit loud for me). Being an active participant makes it easier to intervene at an early stage and when that isn&#39;t working well &nbsp;one of them will come with me which also gives them some 1 on 1 time which has historically been in short supply. &nbsp;Things have turned around &nbsp;already and that feeling I had of missing something has gone away.

First the child will need time to trust that the parents have really changed.  The children’s reactions will be to the spanking or new lack, or the time out or new lack, and it will take a while for them to trust the parents to be different.  Any relapse or steps back on the part of the parent will solidify the lack of trust even longer.

Children shouldn’t be taking care of themselves, nor wholly entertaining themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason I bristle when I read other people’s/places’ statements like “He will be in charge of his own education” or “He will be in charge of his own learning” is that it seems harsh and lonely and lazy, on the parents’ part.  It doesn’t encourage interaction.

But when you are close with your children and know them well, knowing when they need help and when they don&#39;t isn&#39;t so difficult and children often *do* need help at times they&#39;re not able to ask for it.  <br><br>&quot;If it&#39;s too contentious, they are idle, tired, or being selfish.&quot;<br><br>:( That&#39;s just a nasty way to talk about children.

Talk, at other times, about how violence and anger get in your way; describe examples of when hitting out makes a situation worse; talk about how situations escalate and how to recognise when that&#39;s starting to happen and to consider if stepping away will be the most productive, helpful thing he can do at that point.

If I&#39;m bored, ideas thrown at me by my well-meaning husband never help me. I&#39;m feeling a sense of ennui rather than not having anything to do. Nothing feels attractive. I simply have to find out how to be at peace with that feeling of ennui and, usually, it then passes. Calling a friend for a chat usually shifts the feeling, or surfing the net.

It was linking a blog post on a site that wasn’t about unschooling.  Unless there’s no equivalent or better unschooling resource, outside links can be a problem.  First problem is the thousands (maybe only hundreds are reading) of members of this group who might provide hits to a commercial site<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond problem is that the advice might not be great, and I don’t want us to spend much time analyzing things that weren’t by and for unschoolers anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, it matches a post I returned from here yesterday, though in another topic, so I’m going to bring two things here as bad examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quote from the article I didn’t love (sorry, to the mom who brought it; I hope you’ll understand):<br/>\n_________<br/>\n<br/>\nI gently acknowledged that they both seemed upset and wanted the bean bag. I then allowed the scuffle to proceed with the repeated use of the phrase:<br/>\n<br/>\n“I won’t let you touch her. I need to keep you safe!”<br/>\n<br/>\nThis meant ensuring they had no physical contact with each other. They could struggle as much as they liked over the actual bean bag but were not permitted to touch each other.<br/>\n_____________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe title of the article talked about “one simple phrase,” but that’s two phrases, and not simple and in kid-world, it’s a long speech.<br/>\n-=-“I won’t let you touch her. I need to keep you safe!”-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut meanwhile they can tussle over physical property?  And struggle as much as they like?  WHY?  They can still get hurt without physical contact with each other.  Sticks, rocks, snowballs, guns… that’s no physical contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo days ago, I returned a post that had this advice (though in another topic).  I will post my response to the author below that.  It only went to her and the moderators at the time.<br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I refuse to get involved in squabbles unless someone has done something to harm another or is doing something that will keep them out of heaven.

That&#39;s what he \nthought.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>When I first started to change my approach, there were times that he would \nseem to quickly snap, become very angry&nbsp;and charge at her.&nbsp; I stayed \nclose enough that I could physically intervene to protect my daughter and also \nunderstand the nuance of what had triggered it.&nbsp; There were times that I \nwould literally leap between them.&nbsp; For a time, after he started trusting \nme but before he knew what else to do with his big emotions, I would leap \nbetween them &amp; he would physically crash/collapse into me and \ndischarge&nbsp;much of that pent up anger.&nbsp; I could tell that he was trying \nnot to hurt me and would&nbsp;try to have us tumble onto the couch or somewhere \nsafe together&nbsp;that we could land in a big, angry, confused hug.&nbsp; Then \nI would separate them to different rooms and listen to both sides.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Because I was there and saw the build up there was no he said/she \nsaid.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was&nbsp;able to have deeper, more meaningful conversations \nwith them about what had happened and try to encourage empathy, \nunderstanding,&nbsp;patience and forgiveness&nbsp;on both sides. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>One thing that came to light was that he was frustrated that I was always \ntaking his sister&#39;s side.&nbsp; I saw it as&nbsp;protecting her, he saw it as me \ntaking her side and him getting in trouble/her winning.&nbsp;We \ntalked&nbsp;about that, at quiet times when no one was upset.&nbsp; I made more \neffort to help him&nbsp;feel that I am always on his side and here to support \nand protect him as well.&nbsp; I listened to him, tried to make him feel \nimportant &amp; understood, did special things with him just the two of \nus.&nbsp; I still do those things.&nbsp; We have almost no fighting in our house \nnow.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I can imagine that if I were 8 and I had a 6, 4 and 2 year old always \nmessing up my stuff and getting in my way that it would be very \nfrustrating.&nbsp; I imagine that if my mom didn&#39;t understand my frustration but \ninstead got angry at me and &quot;took sides&quot; with the other children (from his \nperspective) that would make me sad and mad.&nbsp; I might feel misunderstood, \nalone.&nbsp; I might wonder what was wrong with me for not being a better \nchild.&nbsp; I might long for a closer connection with my parents and siblings \nbut I might not know how to get there.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I can imagine how grateful I&#39;d be for a mom who took the time to stop and \nunderstand me, help me find some space of my own, love me through my imperfect \nmoments.&nbsp; I can imagine how hopeful that would make me feel.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>-Cass</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings & hitting","postDate":"1448732822","msgId":76354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFQkFDRUNGLTA5OUYtNENENy1CRDU2LTZGQjZCNzYxRDQwM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG4zY2E2MCsxOTluZmZ2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG4zY2E2MCsxOTluZmZ2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76353,"nextInTopic":76356,"prevInTime":76353,"nextInTime":76355,"topicId":76353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I ve been trying to offer alternative things to do when he is feeling bored or needs some amusement and he did come up with a short list of things he might","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1236182400\">-=- I&#39;ve been trying to offer alternative things to do when he is feeling bored or needs some amusement and he did come up with a short list of things he might rather do and that has helped some.

My kids are 8,6,4 and almost 2 (the 2 year old isn&#39;t hitting...yet). The hitting seems to stem from the oldest. I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while now, recently we were able to talk about it and it seems like the hitting stems from 3 things: 1: he&#39;s annoyed/frustrated by his brothers and can&#39;t stop himself in the heat of the moment 2: he&#39;s bored so he starts trouble, and 3: he&#39;s trying to get a raise out of the younger ones cause he thinks the way they screech is funny. Often it starts #2 or 3 and the younger ones get frustrated with him and we end up with #1. I admit that I used to use time outs, I was raised being spanked so I thought it was a good alternative but we no longer do that. I&#39;ve been trying to offer alternative things to do when he is feeling bored or needs some amusement and he did come up with a short list of things he might rather do and that has helped some. Yet everyday they&#39;re still at it. &nbsp;To the folks I know &nbsp;IRL the hitting seems minor (they&#39;re advice is the typical spank, yell, take stuff away) but I believe we all have the right to live here without being hit or harassed by someone else (including me) even if it is &quot;minor&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;ve been reading here for a while now and find the advice to be so helpful and insightful. &nbsp;So with hope and an open heart &amp; mind I ask for your advice. Thank you!</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76312,"nextTopicId":76375}}
