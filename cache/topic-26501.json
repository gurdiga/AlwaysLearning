Their kids aren&#39;t shoving up front to make sure they  <br/>\nhave a TV, or that if their sibling has one they have one too (TV or  <br/>\nfive dollars or a donut or whatever the thing is).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t matter if Holly is the only one in a world of six  <br/>\nbillion people who prefers not to have a TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that in a home in which the parents are willing and  <br/>\neager to provide their children with an in-bedroom TV, it has come to  <br/>\npass in that real-world longterm situation, that a young teen put the  <br/>\nTV out of her room one day and hasn&#39;t wanted it back, nor a more  <br/>\nconvenient replacement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat fact disproves any and all claims of desperation, grabbiness,  <br/>\nthe commonly-stated &quot;evils&quot; of parents letting kids have a TV, the  <br/>\nslippery-slope threats of what will happen if children are allowed to  <br/>\nhave TV in their rooms and never come out, and ALL of that.  It  <br/>\ndissolves into a mist because Holly Dodd COULD have that and doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant it.  It is NOT a natural inevitable &quot;fact&quot; that if children  <br/>\naren&#39;t limited and controlled they WILL do nothing but watch TV, eat  <br/>\nsugar, etc.  One of the entries in that current unschooling blog  <br/>\ncarnival has a GREAT list of such things that the mom came up with,  <br/>\nbut here are lots<br/>\n  that real parents have stated in public about their own children.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHolly alone would disprove them.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s NOT Holly alone.  There are scores of children, in families  <br/>\non this list and related others, who DO have a HUGE range of choices,  <br/>\nand they choose to be with their families, to hang out with their  <br/>\nsiblings, to do things with their parents, to be helpful to  <br/>\nstrangers.  BY CHOICE.  In the case of my own kids (and scores of  <br/>\nothers) it&#39;s not even out of religious obligation or to get a scout  <br/>\nbadge.  It is simply because it seems like the right thing to do at  <br/>\nthe moment, to help someone or to do little things that no one else  <br/>\nwill ever even know they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO have really good kids, and yes, sometimes we get grouchy, but we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t rejoice in it or maintain and defend our arguments.  We see  <br/>\nthem, pull back out, make things better, and go again.  Because the  <br/>\nprinciples on which all this nest of unschooling is based are part of  <br/>\nthe decision making of everyone involved, things work out better in  <br/>\n2006 than they would have if we hadn&#39;t made conscious decisions to do  <br/>\nthe best we could based on our beliefs and intentions, in each of the  <br/>\npast twenty years.<br/>\n<br/>\nANYONE can move toward this.
