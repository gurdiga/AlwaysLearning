The permit is needed here to make your practice on the <br/>\nroad legal, I think.

I spent the first 20 years of my life in<br/>\nSan Francisco. With the combination of the incredibly<br/>\nexcellent system of mass transit (trains, BART,<br/>\nbusses, rail system, ferries, shuttles) that<br/>\ncrisscrosses the city and links the surrounding<br/>\ncommunities AND the high cost of parking and insurance<br/>\nin the city, it was not necessary for me to get a<br/>\nlicense for freedom, nor feasible for me monetarily. <br/>\nPlus the city is compact, being only 7 miles square,<br/>\nand you can walk to the store, to local restaurants,<br/>\nlandromat, whatever.  I took busses to school and<br/>\ncollege, to work, to friends houses, parties, events,<br/>\nand to the train station or bart to go out of town, or<br/>\nshuttles to the airport.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I moved to New Mexico at 20, I had never been<br/>\nbehind the wheel of a car, even for any kind of<br/>\ndrivers ed.  I found myself living in an neighborhood<br/>\non the edge of town, and everything was so much<br/>\nfarther away from evertyhing else than I was used to. <br/>\nI needed a license post haste, just to get back and<br/>\nforth to work.  I spent one hour behind the wheel to<br/>\npractice, walked into the Licensing place and took my<br/>\ntest.  I had a behind the wheel test, but was not made<br/>\nto drive on the freeway or to parallel park.  I had no<br/>\nprevious driving experience, no questions were asked<br/>\nabout that at all.  That first car I drove for sevreal<br/>\nyears was a huge buick LeSabre boat of a car, with the<br/>\nlong extended bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a little over 9 years ago.  I am a very good<br/>\ndriver, self taught.  I have had one accident, a<br/>\nfender bender in heavy stop and go traffic, years<br/>\nafter I got my license.  I do great in defensive<br/>\nsituations in fast urban traffic, in strange cities,<br/>\nat night, on country roads, have since driven all over<br/>\nCalifornia, in Portland, Seattle, all over Washington<br/>\nState, in icy conditions, rain, sleet, fog, snow, you<br/>\nname it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9891,"nextTopicId":10014}}
