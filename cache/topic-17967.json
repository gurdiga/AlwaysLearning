As for <br/>\nthe sex scene <br/>\n&gt; they really didn&#39;t think much of it.  My youngest said it was too <br/>\nboring and <br/>\n&gt; it was a good time for a potty break.  They both love action <br/>\nmovies.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the most part they are very good at censoring themselves.  They <br/>\nknow what <br/>\n&gt; they do and do not like.

He will choose to not watch or when it starts <br/>\nto get scary <br/>\n&gt; he will leave the room for a few minutes.  They think of sex scenes <br/>\nas <br/>\n&gt; boring.  It isn&#39;t what they want to watch and will generally go <br/>\nplay with LEGOs or <br/>\n&gt; something, it has no interest for them.  Now when the action comes <br/>\nback on they <br/>\n&gt; want to watch.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They also don&#39;t like a lot of violence that is &quot;real&quot; looking.  <br/>\nThey loved <br/>\n&gt; LOTR.

So every parent is different I <br/>\nguess.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to see Matrix Reloaded.  My boys are 6 and 9.  We saw the first one <br/>\nand really liked it.  My boys liked the action in the second one but on the <br/>\nwhole thought is was a very confusing movie, me too.  LOL.  As for the sex scene <br/>\nthey really didn&#39;t think much of it.  My youngest said it was too boring and <br/>\nit was a good time for a potty break.  They both love action movies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part they are very good at censoring themselves.  They know what <br/>\nthey do and do not like.  Sometimes if I know a movie might have a scary part <br/>\nI will tell them so they are prepared ahead of time.  My oldest hates scary <br/>\nmovies, he is nine.  He will choose to not watch or when it starts to get scary <br/>\nhe will leave the room for a few minutes.  They think of sex scenes as <br/>\nboring.  It isn&#39;t what they want to watch and will generally go play with LEGOs or <br/>\nsomething, it has no interest for them.  Now when the action comes back on they <br/>\nwant to watch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also don&#39;t like a lot of violence that is &quot;real&quot; looking.  They loved <br/>\nLOTR.  Again thought some of the slower non-action parts were a little boring, <br/>\nespecially my youngest, he is six.  They didn&#39;t like The Patriot.  To them it <br/>\nwas too real and too bloody.  They left the room and played on their computers <br/>\nduring that one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are good at censoring for themselves.  And I am sure their tastes will <br/>\nchange over the years.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] censorship","postDate":"1074538706","msgId":18008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Ny4yYmVjOTJmNi4yZDNkODJkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18007,"nextInTopic":18009,"prevInTime":18007,"nextInTime":18009,"topicId":17967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/19/2004 11:44:59 AM Mountain Standard Time, slb725dragon@aol.com writes: -=-My sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-674933338\">In a message dated 1/19/2004 11:44:59 AM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slb725dragon@...\">slb725dragon@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-My sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) about even <br/>\nviolence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded.

But since you asked;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do censor what my children read, to an extent. Here is why. I do this for <br/>\nthe same reasons that I censor what they watch. I do not allow them to watch <br/>\nmovies where people are having sex, or running around naked. <br/>\nMy daughters are 11 and 14.<br/>\nI watched Matrix Reloaded, which they wanted to see. There was one scene <br/>\nWhere Keanu and the woman were having sex. They can&#39;t watch it. I just think that <br/>\n(my opinion only) those types of things are inappropriate for my daughters. I <br/>\nlove horror movies. They are my favorite, but I will not allow them to watch <br/>\nmost of them because of the sex. The same thing goes for books.<br/>\nMy favorite books are by Stephen King and Anne Rice. There are sex &quot;scenes&quot; <br/>\nin books as well.  Romance novels (like from Harlequin) have parts that are <br/>\npretty much porn. They do not need that kind of information at their ages, in my <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not just say &quot;NO!&quot; I read the entire book, or watch the entire movie, <br/>\nfirst. Then I make an informed decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt their ages, I no longer worry about the violence in movies. They have been <br/>\nraised away from such stuff as much as possible, so that is not a factor for <br/>\nmy daughters. They know it isn&#39;t real, they know it isn&#39;t okay, they can watch <br/>\nit. So far, there have only been two movies, without sex, that I have not let <br/>\nthem watch, and both had explicit pictures of murdered children that I found <br/>\nvery disturbing. One was a Jack Nicholson movie, and the other was a <br/>\ndocumentary (2 part), Paradise lost, about a true case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) about even <br/>\nviolence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded.

When my oldest was little, before I <br/>\nwas an unschooler, I use to read most of the books she read so that we could <br/>\ndiscuss them.  I tend to enjoy reading childrens literature so this was just <br/>\nsomething I naturally did.

For one thing, she says, most of the books <br/>\nin the teen section at our library are watered down &quot;pop&quot; stuff.  *Note* she <br/>\nenjoys these a lot, but she said she felt that someone&#39;s reading ability could <br/>\nbe stifled if they weren&#39;t allowed to read novels from the adult section.  She <br/>\nalso noted that as far as things like explicit sex and violence (which I <br/>\nassume is what the censoring mother is worried about?) go, the books in the teen <br/>\nsection are not censored by the librarians.  Books go into the teen section <br/>\nbecause someone feels that the books will particularly appeal to teens.  You will <br/>\nfind plenty of sex and violence in these books.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO I think that it&#39;s more important that children are comfortable talking <br/>\nwith their parents about anything.  Then censoring doesn&#39;t seem to be much of <br/>\nan issue.  I wonder if some parents think there is a *magic* age at which it&#39;s <br/>\nOK for children to read whatever they want.  This seems rather humorous to me. <br/>\n I&#39;m imagining an 18yo running to the adult section of the library and <br/>\npulling down lots of books to check out hoping to find out what secrets are in <br/>\nthem.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jacqueline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] censorship","postDate":"1074523323","msgId":17984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE5MTQ0MjAzLjYzNTQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMWEwMWMzZGU0YiQwODUzZjdlMCRjMTJlMWM0MUBob21lPg=="},"prevInTopic":17983,"nextInTopic":17986,"prevInTime":17983,"nextInTime":17985,"topicId":17967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
