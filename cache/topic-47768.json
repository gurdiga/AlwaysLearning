There are plenty of mamas who spank and ground and shame and blame their kids.*<br/>\n<br/>\n I hear what you are saying. I think there is a huge difference between instinct and natural reactions or learned cycles from our own upbringing though.  I gain immense wisdom from others when something they say resonates so deeply that a lump grows in my throat because I know it applies to me.... and that feeling is more the instinct I was referring to... not our natural, unquestioned learned reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess even though I naturally fell in to AP when my kids were babies and naturally fell in to unschooling as they grew- I still don&#39;t really believe in a set of standards or rules that I should live by because others think they know best. Like you said, data changes all the time. I don&#39;t believe in a ton of rules and regulations for my kids to live by, I guess I model that by living free as well. I usually only listen on lists because it seems to be a trend to demand a certain standard of each other that we&#39;d never demand of our kids. Not that I mind, it&#39;s just that we share these little tiny snippets of our life. I summed 4 years up in a few paragraphs and it is impossible for anyone to get the whole picture that way. I only shared the points that would examplify how you can indeed let a child make choices that you wouldn&#39;t have made for them- and they would come out fine and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n*&gt;&gt;&gt;** there is no way to avoid that fungus completely, especially if you live anywhere near an agricultural area.*<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course not, you just do the best with what you are able to work with, right? And truly she doesn&#39;t have as bad of a problem in its natural biological state. It builds in her system, but she doesn&#39;t have the strong purging reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n*&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If it were me, my focus would be on immune building things. People with normal, healthy immune systems are able to pass that fungus through their bodies without problems.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pumping milk (since she had started to wean) and giving it to her in a cup for years, literally. I&#39;m really not sure what stronger immune building substance I could have given her. A nutritionist from the UK that we worked closely with had us try a myriad of dietary approaches to strengthen her system, especially in mineral content. Western Medicine was far from the first or only approach we took. Why does her body struggle with this fungus? I have no idea. I wish I did. I certainly don&#39;t fear her getting the fungus in her system, I just feel bummed when she isn&#39;t well, as any mother does. Most days she chooses acai berry, emergenC, omegas, and then some others more at random... If you know something else she could do to help build her immune system that would be wonderful, we&#39;re always open to hearing ideas. She does have epilepsy as well, perhaps that wears on her immune system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO &quot;people with healthy immune systems&quot; feels like a heavy, loaded statement. I&#39;m not going to eliminate any ideas, like I said above I&#39;m open to that idea.  But maybe you should be open to the idea that YOUR body and your truth is that all people with a healthy immune system can pass that fungus without a problem. Maybe they aren&#39;t. Maybe my daughter (who is rarely sick in &quot;typical&quot; ways) can both have a healthy immune system and have a body that simply doesn&#39;t work best with X, Y or Z for whatever reason. I&#39;m one of those people who can pretty much eat anything I want without any reaction, and I don&#39;t get sick often at all. I grew up poor eating crap, and I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m not overweight, I&#39;m not unhealthy. That is my truth. That doesn&#39;t mean it is my daughter&#39;s truth or experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n*&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Scientific data changes all the time. Medical information changes all the time. Kid&#39;s bodies change all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we live in fear of the world, we&#39;ll find ways to protect ourselves and our children from it. If we live openly engaging the world, the focus becomes, not of protecting ourselves, but of finding ways to live in it peacefully.*<br/>\n<br/>\nAvoiding what makes you sick isn&#39;t fighting or fearing the world at all, it can be a part of living peacefully in it. I would imagine it is rather common in the animal kingdom. Just because other people eat something with this fungus doesn&#39;t mean we have to. We should each do for our body what feels best. For me that is part of living happily and embracing our world instead of feeling somehow in need or determined to find a way to eat said food that disagrees with you just because others can.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;* it seems to me that if someone is sick, there are still many choices in which to live peacefully and fully without someone feeling lack. Unschooling works really well when all ideas are open to consideration, even ones that the parents think will be harmful. I don&#39;t accept medical opinions outright, or scientific data, or anything else for that matter. I like to question everything.*<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. And as I said, all ideas are open to consideration, even eating said food. Any other idea brought to the table would be welcome as well. Another idea just hasn&#39;t been presented in awhile. Not due to lack of interest, it just hasn&#39;t been found. I don&#39;t think she feels a lack. Eat something enough times and get that sick, it no longer even sounds appealing. According to her the food she&#39;s eaten and gotten sick from sounds repulsive now. She&#39;s figured out (and is figuring out) which foods feel good in her being and which don&#39;t. I brought her a gameboy to play with at stores to prolong the noticing of the shiny wrappers- but once she was interested we talked.

We love our children.  What unschoolers will do is try to satisfy the underlying need our children are asking for.  Perhaps the child who wants to play in the street just wants a huge place to run around in, or a large concrete area to bike or skateboard.  We can help them find a safe way to fulfill that need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: About food","postDate":"1254837265","msgId":47812,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCQ0EzNDdGLTI0ODYtNDY1MS04QjM0LUVBM0ZFN0VGRkIxQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhZmQ5aCtpbTN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhZmQ5aCtpbTN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47810,"nextInTopic":47813,"prevInTime":47811,"nextInTime":47813,"topicId":47768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I tend to believe<br/>\nstrongly in balancing good information with mama-instincts and with<br/>\nfamilial discussion. The end that each of our families come to will<br/>\noften times be different. I can share my story to share how I tried to<br/>\nfind the balance between doing what I felt was best at the time and<br/>\ntrying to honor my daughter as an intelligent and capable being in<br/>\ncharge of her own path. It was neither a perfect example or an epic<br/>\nfail, it was the sometimes shakey line we found on our path together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my middle daughter was little I did restrict some food. Not from<br/>\nthe start mind you, I started out never commenting on food choices. My<br/>\noldest was fine with that process. My middle started getting really<br/>\nsick about the time she chose to wean. Not playing, laying listlessly,<br/>\nvomitting 10 minutes after eating. Things no mama likes to see. It got<br/>\nworse and worse, specialists were visited and eventually we found her<br/>\nbody was over run with Aspergillis Niger, a fungus. It is used in the<br/>\nprocessed food industry as a fermenting agent. It was odd, because on<br/>\nthe whole we ate primarily whole foods. Her body just didn&#39;t expel<br/>\nthis fungus as others seem to be able to do and her body just reacts<br/>\nviolently to it. The fungus had attacked her ears and caused so many<br/>\nproblems in them and in her gut.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a couple years I got tight, probably overly so. I made a lot of<br/>\ndesserts, but never allowed convenience foods. We talked, I explained,<br/>\ninformation was key- but it seriously sucked for both of us. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nin my nature, and I doubt it was happy for her. I avoided being around<br/>\nsuch foods, I tried hard to avoid actually having to say no... I<br/>\nbrought something to distract her at the checkout rather than have to<br/>\nsay no at the check out for example...But kids are smart, I think she<br/>\nknew all those colorful wrappers at the store weren&#39;t something we<br/>\ncould choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround age 4 distraction became less effective and we started talking<br/>\nmore and more... For awhile we would read labels together and she was<br/>\nhappy find compromises with me of those colorful labels. I think<br/>\naround 5 she wanted something I knew would make her sick. She didn&#39;t<br/>\ncare that it had HFCS (something fermented with above mentioned<br/>\nfungus). Me not being a &quot;no&quot; type by nature gave her the information,<br/>\nbut when she perservered I said that it was ultimately her choice. She<br/>\nate it, and I drove home as fast as safely possible. We got home, she<br/>\ngot sick, and stayed in bed that day and much of the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nRepeat that scenario quite a few times over the following year and we<br/>\neventually got back to label reading together to find options that<br/>\ndon&#39;t have her biggest triggers. Now at age 6, what I had gathered as<br/>\na truth she now shares. Maybe because she got to experience it for<br/>\nherself. It is no longer what I believe to be true, but it is what she<br/>\nalso believes to be true. She now is the one making that choice. While<br/>\nI felt it was important that I help look out for her for a time, I<br/>\nfelt it also had to be balanced with giving her the control of her<br/>\ndiet as she came to understand. But that comes with  the price of<br/>\nallowing them the freedom to truly understand, not just understand our<br/>\nword.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is a candy lover, of this there is no doubt. It has been accused<br/>\nthat this is because I tried so hard to hide such food from her when<br/>\nshe was 2-4. Maybe that is it, or maybe she resents being limited by<br/>\nher own body, or maybe she simply likes how it tastes. I like sugar<br/>\ntoo, honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the reason, she is who she is. She would have had to discover<br/>\nthis for herself- age 5, 15 or 20. The only thing I did differently<br/>\nthan some others is given up control so she was free to figure her<br/>\nbody out for herself earlier in life. And I&#39;m no expert on this, I do<br/>\nstruggle with how much information to give about dietary choices. I<br/>\nsometimes have to remind myself to back off. I&#39;m honest with my kids<br/>\nabout that. But I think it is all a balance... you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is sort of off topic, and I in no way intend to suggest that any<br/>\none religious choice is better than another. Just sharing. My Dad was<br/>\na liberal hippy type. He ended up a single father when my mom ran off,<br/>\nand he converted to conservative Christianity. Probably because he<br/>\nneeded community, and most largely because he felt that it was his<br/>\n&quot;duty&quot; as a father to do as his parents did and provide us morals and<br/>\nethics- to him religion seemed the dutiful thing to do for us. It was<br/>\nvery heavily pushed on us as our only choice in life. (It was a small<br/>\nreligious group that excommunicates those who don&#39;t follow to the<br/>\nletter). As soon as we were teenagers and could drive ourselves, he<br/>\nquit going and once we left home he slowly went back to being &quot;him&quot;.<br/>\nBoth my brother and me are non-religious, we&#39;re both socially liberal<br/>\nand stopped attending in our early twenties. My Dad could have saved<br/>\nhimself a lot of heartache by just being him, and letting us be us. He<br/>\nreverted back to thinking he had to be the dutiful parent who does X,<br/>\nY, and Z to be a good parent. But the truth was, for all that pushing<br/>\nus into one lifestyle- we eventually found our own truths anyway. I<br/>\nthink the message is to let your kids find their own truths, not that<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to be positive mentors and share information. Sometimes<br/>\nit is important to rethink what we interpret our &quot;duty&quot; to be as<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, October 5, 2009, Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 10/5/2009 12:23 PM, Marina DeLuca-Howard wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am not sure the idea that sugar makes kids hyper is an old wives tale--it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seems to have somehow come out of the medical community or perhaps it is an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; old teacher&#39;s tale?

I was never even allowed to eat birthday cake at someone else&#39;s birthday party because it all had dairy in it.  I never got to experience the cause and effect of what it was like to eat dairy and get sick, until I was an adult and binged on those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did know without a doubt as a kid was that I really hated beef and pork.  I hated it with a passion and was forced to eat it because it was good for me and cost money and it was the food that was provided for me.  I remember my dad and my grandmother fighting about it when she would visit.  My grandma would always say that I shouldn&#39;t be forced to eat it if I didn&#39;t want to.  So all these years later I ended up in the hospital, after my body shut down and refused to function like normal.  I was still nursing at the time, so I didn&#39;t take the drs up on their steroid treatments.  I went to a naturopath instead.  The first thing she did was check for allergies.  Guess what came up as a huge big time allergy?  That&#39;s right, beef and pork.  After completely eliminating it from my diet, I can&#39;t eat even a small amount without getting VERY sick, and it&#39;s immediate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that, if given the choice as a child, I wouldn&#39;t have eaten those things, and I would&#39;ve tried and seen for myself that dairy was bad too.  AND maybe, just maybe I wouldn&#39;t have the crazy allergic reaction to those things now, maybe I&#39;d still be able to eat those things in moderation, but instead I must avoid these things or suffer severely.  Nor would I have ended up in the hospital with a huge hospital bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille, 15, has discovered on her own that eggs make her sick, she won&#39;t eat them.  Margaux, 8, can handle small amounts of dairy, but there are times when she won&#39;t eat any at all and she WILL pass on ice cream.  I don&#39;t tell my kids what to eat.  I do tell them if something has eggs or dairy in it and to what extent it does.  They make the choice.  It&#39;s their bodies, they live with the consequences of their choices, good and bad.  They make good choices more often than bad choices in the food allergy arena.  Sometimes Margaux does want ice cream, and she eats it joyfully and we help her feel better if she feels badly afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;What about food additives, coloring, sweeteners and such.

Food additives, coloring, sweeteners, none of those things cause food allergies.  Sometimes people can be allergic to those things though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nADHD isn&#39;t caused by food either, it&#39;s more of an environmental factor than anything else.  There a many accounts of kids with ADHD being taken out of school and suddenly the symptoms are gone.  If a kid is left to fidget and focus on what they want to, they won&#39;t be hyper and unfocused because they are being forced to pay attention to something they have no interest in.  Kids should not be sitting still all day focusing on adult like activities.  Their bodies and brains aren&#39;t meant for that.  Some kids can get through it, but other kids can&#39;t at all, and it&#39;s not because they have a disorder, it&#39;s because the environment isn&#39;t suited to that child&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] About food","postDate":"1254784679","msgId":47799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4OTMwRTUxLTVCMjEtNEVGQi1CMzUyLTY2ODIxQ0Y3NjkyQ0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI1NTMuNDM3OTQucW1Ad2ViODE1MDEubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhYnVvZitvdTVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiAgPDBGQ0U0MkVELUFGNjQtNEQ1QS05RTM3LTZGRDlCOTkxODNCM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gIDw0QUNBMTg5RC4xMDUwNTA5QG1hYy5jb20+ICA8NDgwNEQ4RUI0QThCNDkwMDg5MTQzQTRBMjYzNkE0ODVAUm9ja2V0U2F1Y2UyPiA8MTc0ZGY5ZGMwOTEwMDUxMjIzeTdlNTk2NjM4czkxNjE5ZWQ2NDEyMmQ2NjhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwyNTUzLjQzNzk0LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47798,"nextInTopic":47800,"prevInTime":47798,"nextInTime":47800,"topicId":47768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was young and couldn t sleep because of growing pains, my mum (Canadian of British descent) got me a spoonful of Lyle s Golden Syrup.

I have never heard an elderly woman say sugar makes<br/>\nanyone hyper:)<br/>\n<br/>\nOld wives used sugar as medicine, as a treat, and for lots of things I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow about I am sure.  My grandma always dissolved sugar in a glass of water<br/>\nas a cure for tummy aches for me as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe celebrate with various yummy sugar laden foods all the time--birthdays,<br/>\nholidays and just because.  We also eat lots of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week my youngest remarked, casually at lunch, he likes vegetarian<br/>\nfood.  I clarified he was referring to green beans, and as far as he was<br/>\nconcerned vegetables were vegetarian food.  Yes, vegetarian food.  Because<br/>\nof course only vegetarians can eat veggies!  At which point I supplied<br/>\ninformation that people were omnivores--meaning they can eat lots of things<br/>\nbesides meat and vegetables.  He shrugged and continued eating happily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was ice cream in the fridge, cookies, and other food available but he<br/>\nwas really enjoying sitting eating veggies with me.  The meat sandwich sat<br/>\nuntouched, even though he had requested it and been annoyed I chose to sit<br/>\nwith him eating some veggies.  I seemed to be enjoying my food so much he<br/>\nthought he would try it and it turned out to be tasty or something he needed<br/>\nat the moment.  He had had waffles slathered in whipped cream, and maple<br/>\nsyrup for breakfast.  His mind wanted meat and bread out of habit at lunch,<br/>\nwith apple slices or fruit--but his body went for the greens.  He at the<br/>\nsandwich later in the day.  The opportunity to eat healthy foods is<br/>\navailable.  As an adult thats what I eat most of the time, and the<br/>\nopportunity to eat treats is always available, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nProcessed meat wasn&#39;t always around--I don&#39;t eat it and my dh finds it salty<br/>\nand kind of greasy.  I used to feed them leftover chicken or cheese or egg<br/>\nsalad, or peanut butter in sandwiches.  That is what we had.  So, when it<br/>\nwas available my kids loved to eat processed meat in large quantities.  They<br/>\nasked for it at home and I bought it, so at first they ate lots of it.  Ie I<br/>\ncould have fed them a steak or a chicken at that price--and in my head I<br/>\nthought they were eating inferior processed foods.  But now that I am aware<br/>\nthey want it, I buy more of it, and focus on nitrite free oven roasted<br/>\nchicken/turkey or roast beef slices.  It works for me who tries to limit<br/>\nadditives, and the kids who aren&#39;t wanting the additives just the meat in<br/>\ntasty easy to use slices have cut back and are now enjoying other foods!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n2009/10/5 DJ250 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dj250@...\">dj250@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tee Hee!

Nutrition &quot;knowledge&quot; can be very<br/>\n&gt; faddish and even scientific understanding of nutrition has changed many<br/>\n&gt; many times over the years. I have a friend who imposed a macrobiotic<br/>\n&gt; diet on her family for years - very very strictly adhered to - and the<br/>\n&gt; kids ended up with health problems that were directly due to their diet.<br/>\n&gt; She was sure that was THE most healthy diet. They never shared food at<br/>\n&gt; potlucks - brought their own. On the surface, the diet looked fantastic<br/>\n&gt; - I saw them eating lots of green leafy stuff and brown rice. But it<br/>\n&gt; turned out to be missing some very essential nutrients.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of people think sugar makes kids hyper -- but scientific studies<br/>\n&gt; have shown that&#39;s an old wives&#39; tale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How MANY kids have their diets restricted by parents who hold false<br/>\n&gt; beliefs about nutrition?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second - a little of just about anything won&#39;t hurt. Even really poor<br/>\n&gt; nutrition has its effect only over time, it isn&#39;t like eating potato<br/>\n&gt; chips is going to cause obesity today. It is the overall pattern of<br/>\n&gt; eating, over months and years, that causes health problems. So - relax<br/>\n&gt; and let kids experiement with different foods - let them explore and<br/>\n&gt; enjoy. Provide a wide variety of healthy and appealing foods rather than<br/>\n&gt; restricting foods. If kids want potato chips, have those available, but<br/>\n&gt; maybe also have those little baby carrots and some yummy dip, for that<br/>\n&gt; kind of munchy eating, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Third - restricting ANYTHING that is desired makes it more desirable.<br/>\n&gt; This is called &quot;marginal utility&quot; and it works like this. Imagine you<br/>\n&gt; have an unlimited supply of something you like - pizza, maybe? It is cut<br/>\n&gt; into very small slices. You have a slice - it is delicious - you enjoy<br/>\n&gt; every bite a lot. So you decide to have a second slice. It is also super<br/>\n&gt; good, but maybe not quite as absolutely wonderfully delicious as the<br/>\n&gt; first slice, right? You&#39;re not quite as hungry, plus you already had<br/>\n&gt; one, so it isn&#39;t a new and surprisingly delicious taste. But - still it<br/>\n&gt; is super good. So - you have a third slice. This time you&#39;re not that<br/>\n&gt; hungry, plus you&#39;ve had two slices already so there is a sort of<br/>\n&gt; been-there-done-that feeling to it. Want a fourth slice? Maybe you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather have some salad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if something is SO delicious - why don&#39;t you just keep eating<br/>\n&gt; forever? Because there is diminishing marginal utility. The value to<br/>\n&gt; you, the pleasure you get, from each additional slice of pizza, gets<br/>\n&gt; smaller as you have more and more additional slices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - you eat pizza until the marginal utility of one more slice is lower<br/>\n&gt; than the marginal utility of something else. imagine we only let you<br/>\n&gt; have one - no more! Then your desire for more is based on the value the<br/>\n&gt; second slice would have for you. Still quite high marginal utility. You<br/>\n&gt; will seem to &quot;crave&quot; more.

Ironically, my daughter had gone to the grocery store with them once and had taken her own money and gotten a huge bag of candy from the bulk bins.  She didn&#39;t eat much of it, but their child did.<br/>\nSo, a week or so went by, with her eating all this candy.  One day, mom came to pick her up and she was eating some.  Her mom freaked a little and pulled me aside to tell me that she shouldn&#39;t eat any more candy because she is only allowed one or two pieces of candy at any given time and certainly not everyday because it makes her daughter hyper and unable to go to sleep.<br/>\nThe thing is, though, the mom hadn&#39;t known that her daughter had eaten candy every day and way more than one or two pieces.  If she hadn&#39;t seen it happening, she never would&#39;ve known or even guessed, because it didn&#39;t cause hyperness.<br/>\nThe girl told me once that she never goes to sleep right away anyway because she can&#39;t sleep before 11.  Her body simply won&#39;t fall asleep before 11, no matter how hard she tries.  She went on to say that part of the reason is that she feels lonely and scared all by herself in her room.<br/>\nMom could correlate candy and hyper wakefulness, but it has more to do with scared loneliness.  Fear of candy and hyper wakefulness was just a way to find a reason other than the totally obvious, to me, one, for why her daughter stays awake.  To the mom, it seemed a logical correlation, candy equals staying awake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] About food","postDate":"1254764261","msgId":47785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4MDREOEVCNEE4QjQ5MDA4OTE0M0E0QTI2MzZBNDg1QFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBQ0ExODlELjEwNTA1MDlAbWFjLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhhYnVvZitvdTVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MEZDRTQyRUQtQUY2NC00RDVBLTlFMzctNkZEOUI5OTE4M0IzQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NEFDQTE4OUQuMTA1MDUwOUBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47784,"nextInTopic":47790,"prevInTime":47784,"nextInTime":47786,"topicId":47768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tee Hee!

Nutrition &quot;knowledge&quot; can be very <br/>\n  faddish and even scientific understanding of nutrition has changed many <br/>\n  many times over the years. I have a friend who imposed a macrobiotic <br/>\n  diet on her family for years - very very strictly adhered to - and the <br/>\n  kids ended up with health problems that were directly due to their diet. <br/>\n  She was sure that was THE most healthy diet. They never shared food at <br/>\n  potlucks - brought their own. On the surface, the diet looked fantastic <br/>\n  - I saw them eating lots of green leafy stuff and brown rice. But it <br/>\n  turned out to be missing some very essential nutrients.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lots of people think sugar makes kids hyper -- but scientific studies <br/>\n  have shown that&#39;s an old wives&#39; tale.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How MANY kids have their diets restricted by parents who hold false <br/>\n  beliefs about nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second - a little of just about anything won&#39;t hurt. Even really poor <br/>\n  nutrition has its effect only over time, it isn&#39;t like eating potato <br/>\n  chips is going to cause obesity today. It is the overall pattern of <br/>\n  eating, over months and years, that causes health problems. So - relax <br/>\n  and let kids experiement with different foods - let them explore and <br/>\n  enjoy. Provide a wide variety of healthy and appealing foods rather than <br/>\n  restricting foods. If kids want potato chips, have those available, but <br/>\n  maybe also have those little baby carrots and some yummy dip, for that <br/>\n  kind of munchy eating, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Third - restricting ANYTHING that is desired makes it more desirable. <br/>\n  This is called &quot;marginal utility&quot; and it works like this. Imagine you <br/>\n  have an unlimited supply of something you like - pizza, maybe? It is cut <br/>\n  into very small slices. You have a slice - it is delicious - you enjoy <br/>\n  every bite a lot. So you decide to have a second slice. It is also super <br/>\n  good, but maybe not quite as absolutely wonderfully delicious as the <br/>\n  first slice, right? You&#39;re not quite as hungry, plus you already had <br/>\n  one, so it isn&#39;t a new and surprisingly delicious taste. But - still it <br/>\n  is super good. So - you have a third slice. This time you&#39;re not that <br/>\n  hungry, plus you&#39;ve had two slices already so there is a sort of <br/>\n  been-there-done-that feeling to it. Want a fourth slice? Maybe you&#39;d <br/>\n  rather have some salad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, if something is SO delicious - why don&#39;t you just keep eating <br/>\n  forever? Because there is diminishing marginal utility. The value to <br/>\n  you, the pleasure you get, from each additional slice of pizza, gets <br/>\n  smaller as you have more and more additional slices.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So - you eat pizza until the marginal utility of one more slice is lower <br/>\n  than the marginal utility of something else. imagine we only let you <br/>\n  have one - no more! Then your desire for more is based on the value the <br/>\n  second slice would have for you. Still quite high marginal utility. You <br/>\n  will seem to &quot;crave&quot; more. You mother &lt;G&gt; will claim that you&#39;d eat it <br/>\n  forever and never eat anything else. You&#39;ll ACT like that&#39;s all you want <br/>\n  - more pizza.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Restricting foods that you think are less healthy means you <br/>\n  automatically make them more appealing - you make the expected marginal <br/>\n  utility high so that&#39;s the thing the child really really wants.

When and how did you learn this? In my home, food is food. I keep a wide range of foods because I like to have choices and believe my children should be treated no differently. They are as likely to choose cheese & crackers, fruit, eggs, and meat as they are to choose cookies and candy.

If they truly had the choice to eat what they want and when they want, they may fall off your schedule. Do you really fear that possibility?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know my children&#39;s dislikes and don&#39;t force these particular food<br/>\n&gt; items on them. But I have always thought that it was my &quot;duty&quot; as a<br/>\n&gt; parent to make sure that they had enough of everything and have<br/>\n&gt; made them finish their plates. I&#39;m doing it much less now;-) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good for not forcing disliked foods, bad for insisting on a clean plate. That is a great way to create overweight children, forcing them to eat beyond a feeling of satisfaction and into a place where they feel stuffed.  The opposite of that is controlling the amount they are given and calling it quits when you think they have had enough. They may stay hungry which is not good for their bodies either.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about allergies?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve known a couple of families with allergies.  Their kids knew from an early age what foods would make them feel sick. They grow up in a home with parents who share that information. I never saw them desire the foods that made them feel sick. I can&#39;t imagine a parent deliberately keeping that information from the children. Parents can give allergy information with other adults that may share food with the child, but I would teach my children to speak for themselves as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about food additives, coloring, sweeteners and such. They are<br/>\n&gt; known to cause allergies, ADHD and what not. I am always reading<br/>\n&gt; labels making sure I don&#39;t buy the worse of these things. Shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; I do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe certain foods may react differently in different people, but I do not believe foods should be avoided for fear they will cause any specific reaction, unless that food has already been proven to be bad for that person. There could be a very long list of foods to avoid.  Surely that would cause great anxiety, which can also be unhealthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m concerned about too much sugar at the wrong times of the day<br/>\n&gt; for my children.

Their dental checkups are always great. Our dentist lets them know some sugar is okay and that even he eat candy and cookies.  Are you making an informed decision based on reading lots of studies or are you only reading the articles that confirm your fear of sugar? <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They can eat how much they want because I know once they are full,<br/>\n&gt; they will stop!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t you say in a paragraph above that you made them finish their plate?  How will they learn when they feel full if you have given them a preset amount of food?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I am really into healthy choices, organic food, getting the<br/>\n&gt; right nutrients.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see a problem with buying things you like. I do see a problem with not buying things they like. See below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it still a way of controlling what the children eat when it&#39;s me<br/>\n&gt; doing the shopping?

A childhood spent eating Oreos  <br/>\nwill not kill someone. *But* in a home where there are a lot of  <br/>\nchoices and Oreos are just one of them, kids won&#39;t eat nothing but  <br/>\nOreos.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, kids can experiment without killing themselves. Because time  <br/>\nis on your side :-) They can try things out and see the effects. They  <br/>\ncan decide the bad effects are worth the good that&#39;s happening. They  <br/>\ncan decide eventually the bad effects are no longer worth it since  <br/>\nthe bloom has worn off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t do that when someone decides for them.

Unless something is an imminent health risk like  <br/>\npoison or a hurtling Mack truck, know that you could be wrong. And  <br/>\nyour control in the name of your belief is likely to whittle away at  <br/>\ntheir trust in you, whittle at the relationship between you, and very  <br/>\nlikely get them to associate your control with the idea you felt was  <br/>\nso important and they may turn away from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are vegetarians parents who help their kids explore meat. There  <br/>\nare fundamentalist Christians who support their children&#39;s  <br/>\nexploration of beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe less you control, the more you make your beliefs about you and  <br/>\nuse the values for yourself (and the home you create) but don&#39;t use  <br/>\nthem to control your kids, the more likely they will explore them  <br/>\nfreely and happily and come to them, in their own way, joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou got to choose what beliefs you had. Let them. Trust that they&#39;re  <br/>\nthinking beings who can try out ideas and explore their effects and  <br/>\ndecide for themselves. The choices they make for their right now  <br/>\nselves may not be the same they&#39;ll make for their future selves. They  <br/>\nneed the freedom to try things out and experiment to decide what&#39;s  <br/>\nright for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Our family has always had specific mealtimes, because I know when  <br/>\n&gt; the children need food. And it&#39;s always at the same times of the  <br/>\n&gt; day!

We can make  <br/>\ninformed guesses to help us help them, but we can&#39;t really know.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But I have always thought that it was my &quot;duty&quot; as a parent to make  <br/>\n&gt; sure that they had enough of everything and have made them finish  <br/>\n&gt; their plates.

In a way it&#39;s like  <br/>\na magical spell: if we do this, then we can mold them into great  <br/>\nhuman beings.

And to the  <br/>\nkids it feels like control. It feels exactly to them as it would if  <br/>\nyour husband decided fiction was bad for people and forbid you to  <br/>\nread novels or watch movies or shows or plays. It makes no difference  <br/>\nhow sincere, how caring, how strongly he believes. It doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>\nloving or caring. It feels like &quot;I don&#39;t care what you believe.

As they get older, just make it a habit to share the  <br/>\ninformation with kids and help them get what they want. It can just  <br/>\nbe part of life to say &quot;This has peanuts in it. Let&#39;s find something  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids know for certain that mom is on their side and working to  <br/>\nmeet their needs, they are far less likely to dig in their heels and  <br/>\ndemand a particular something. While it can be a part of some kids&#39;  <br/>\npersonalities, far more commonly it&#39;s because parents have taught  <br/>\nkids that fighting is the way they have of getting something they&#39;ve  <br/>\nasked for. When they know you&#39;re trying to help them, there&#39;s little  <br/>\nreason to fight!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What about food additives, coloring, sweeteners and such. They are  <br/>\n&gt; known to cause allergies, ADHD and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nCause allergies? I doubt that. Some kids are sensitive to various  <br/>\nchemicals but I&#39;ve never heard anyone say they cause allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest not to live in fear.

Shouldn&#39;t I do that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s something important to you *for you*, sure, read labels. Read  <br/>\nlabels to help you provide what you&#39;d like to provide, but don&#39;t use  <br/>\nit as a cage to prevent them from having what they would like, if you  <br/>\nsee the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with cooking organic, natural meals. What&#39;s  <br/>\ncontrolling is deciding the kids can&#39;t eat anything but. Provide the  <br/>\ncanvas of healthful meals, but help them explore beyond it. If  <br/>\nthey&#39;re curious about Oreos, buy Oreos and Newman-Os and some other  <br/>\nsubstitutes and have a taste test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the don&#39;t feel foods without additives are box they need to live  <br/>\nin but rather a great place to explore from that *maybe* they&#39;d like  <br/>\nto stay in if they find the benefits are right for them, they&#39;re more  <br/>\nlikely to stay than to flee once you open the gate when they leave  <br/>\nfor college.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m concerned about too much sugar at the wrong times of the day  <br/>\n&gt; for my children.

You&#39;re creating solutions to problems that you only  <br/>\nfear will exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s far easier to fear and prevent than to read to be informed and  <br/>\ntake a chance. There&#39;s lots of information here. If you ask -- better  <br/>\none question at a time rather than the broad topic of food! -- people  <br/>\nwill share their real experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is it still a way of controlling what the children eat when it&#39;s me  <br/>\n&gt; doing the shopping?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would bet that for most kids if we let them choose everything the  <br/>\nfamily would eat for the week they would get bored of the activity  <br/>\nafter a week!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bulk of what we provide will be of our choosing. Why wouldn&#39;t we  <br/>\nuse our own values to create it? But that&#39;s just the foundation.  <br/>\nAccommodating their tastes and explorations is what will make it  <br/>\nappealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When i bring them with me, they buy all the cereals in the shop and  <br/>\n&gt; we can&#39;t fit them all in the cupboard! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney and physical space are realities. (Though too many parents warp  <br/>\nthose with control and fear. Physically only having $5 for groceries  <br/>\nis different than mom deciding what the kids have picked out is &quot;too  <br/>\nmuch&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could give them a certain amount to spend. (It should feel like a  <br/>\nfun challenge. If it feels like you arbitrarily limiting them, then  <br/>\nup the amount or find some other way.) You could ask them to each  <br/>\npick one cereal so they don&#39;t get stale (and follow through on a  <br/>\npromise to get more next time.) Rather than thinking in terms of  <br/>\nresponding to whims, think in terms of meeting their needs. This is  <br/>\ntricky! Our own needs for them can get in the way. Exploring  <br/>\ndifferent cereals is fun. 10 boxes of cereal getting stale isn&#39;t a  <br/>\nneed.

As they get older, just make it a habit to share the  <br/>\ninformation with kids and help them get what they want. It can just  <br/>\nbe part of life to say &quot;This has peanuts in it. Let&#39;s find something  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids know for certain that mom is on their side and working to  <br/>\nmeet their needs, they are far less likely to dig in their heels and  <br/>\ndemand a particular something. While it can be a part of some kids&#39;  <br/>\npersonalities, far more commonly it&#39;s because parents have taught  <br/>\nkids that fighting is the way they have of getting something they&#39;ve  <br/>\nasked for. When they know you&#39;re trying to help them, there&#39;s little  <br/>\nreason to fight!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about food additives, coloring, sweeteners and such. They are  <br/>\n&gt; known to cause allergies, ADHD and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cause allergies? I doubt that. Some kids are sensitive to various  <br/>\nchemicals but I&#39;ve never heard anyone say they cause allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest not to live in fear. Better to live in a world full of wonderful  <br/>\npossibilities, trying things out and deciding on a case by case basis  <br/>\nwhether the consequences are worth the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead less fearful stuff and more from unschoolers who will tell you  <br/>\nwhat really happens when foods are freely accessible. The archives  <br/>\nare full of stories. In addition to Sandra&#39;s site there mine:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am always reading labels making sure I don&#39;t buy the worse of  <br/>\n&gt; these things. Shouldn&#39;t I do that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s something important to you *for you*, sure, read labels. Read  <br/>\nlabels to help you provide what you&#39;d like to provide, but don&#39;t use  <br/>\nit as a cage to prevent them from having what they would like, if you  <br/>\nsee the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with cooking organic, natural meals. What&#39;s  <br/>\ncontrolling is deciding the kids can&#39;t eat anything but. Provide the  <br/>\ncanvas of healthful meals, but help them explore beyond it. If  <br/>\nthey&#39;re curious about Oreos, buy Oreos and Newman-Os and some other  <br/>\nsubstitutes and have a taste test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the don&#39;t feel foods without additives are box they need to live  <br/>\nin but rather a great place to explore from that *maybe* they&#39;d like  <br/>\nto stay in if they find the benefits are right for them, they&#39;re more  <br/>\nlikely to stay than to flee once you open the gate when they leave  <br/>\nfor college.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m concerned about too much sugar at the wrong times of the day  <br/>\n&gt; for my children.

You&#39;re creating solutions to problems that you only  <br/>\nfear will exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s far easier to fear and prevent than to read to be informed and  <br/>\ntake a chance. There&#39;s lots of information here. If you ask -- better  <br/>\none question at a time rather than the broad topic of food! -- people  <br/>\nwill share their real experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it still a way of controlling what the children eat when it&#39;s me  <br/>\n&gt; doing the shopping?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would bet that for most kids if we let them choose everything the  <br/>\nfamily would eat for the week they would get bored of the activity  <br/>\nafter a week!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bulk of what we provide will be of our choosing. Why wouldn&#39;t we  <br/>\nuse our own values to create it? But that&#39;s just the foundation.  <br/>\nAccommodating their tastes and explorations is what will make it  <br/>\nappealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When i bring them with me, they buy all the cereals in the shop and  <br/>\n&gt; we can&#39;t fit them all in the cupboard! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Money and physical space are realities. (Though too many parents warp  <br/>\nthose with control and fear. Physically only having $5 for groceries  <br/>\nis different than mom deciding what the kids have picked out is &quot;too  <br/>\nmuch&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could give them a certain amount to spend. (It should feel like a  <br/>\nfun challenge. If it feels like you arbitrarily limiting them, then  <br/>\nup the amount or find some other way.) You could ask them to each  <br/>\npick one cereal so they don&#39;t get stale (and follow through on a  <br/>\npromise to get more next time.) Rather than thinking in terms of  <br/>\nresponding to whims, think in terms of meeting their needs. This is  <br/>\ntricky! Our own needs for them can get in the way. Exploring  <br/>\ndifferent cereals is fun. 10 boxes of cereal getting stale isn&#39;t a  <br/>\nneed. It&#39;s just poor planning.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139171607,"authorName":"kaclip","from":"&quot;kaclip&quot; &lt;katrine@...&gt;","profile":"kaclip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"About food","postDate":"1254719055","msgId":47768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhYnVvZitvdTVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47771,"prevInTime":47767,"nextInTime":47769,"topicId":47768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m new here, and I am wondering about the food issue.

I&#39;m not an unschooler (yet!) but I&#39;m trying to understand and learn because there&#39;s so much that make sense to me here. I&#39;m reading what Sandra has on her website, but I&#39;m still not sure if I understand how unschoolers do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents and adults, we have learned what is healthy, we know what is good for us. Then why is it not &quot;unschoolish&quot; to talk to your children about that and tell them why certain things are better or worse? And eliminate certain things from the diet that we as parents believe are harmful?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand correctly, children should have free choice in what they eat and when they eat. Our family has always had specific mealtimes, because I know when the children need food. And it&#39;s always at the same times of the day! (about every 3 hours, it&#39;s been like that since birth, through nursing and still today)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my children&#39;s dislikes and don&#39;t force these particular food items on them. But I have always thought that it was my &quot;duty&quot; as a parent to make sure that they had enough of everything and have made them finish their plates. I&#39;m doing it much less now;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about allergies? Do children with peanut allergies automatically know to steer away from food with traces of peanuts? Parents need to watch out for them still right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about food additives, coloring, sweeteners and such. They are known to cause allergies, ADHD and what not.

I&#39;m thinking of their dental health, of getting hyper, or a sugar high with a subsequent drop...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not concerned about their weight, it&#39;s really their health I&#39;m concerned with. They can eat how much they want because I know once they are full, they will stop! But I am really into healthy choices, organic food, getting the right nutrients. Is it still a way of controlling what the children eat when it&#39;s me doing the shopping? When i bring them with me, they buy all the cereals in the shop and we can&#39;t fit them all in the cupboard! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your insights,<br/>\n-Katrine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47843,"nextTopicId":47878}}
