It runs all my post together with what <br/>\never post I am responding to. That is why I keep putting the run of symbols <br/>\nbetween the quote I am responding to and my response. I miss posts all the time <br/>\ntoo. I hate it! Darin suggested going back to 8.0 or getting 8.0 enhanced. For <br/>\nabout two weeks I had to send any email I had written to the mail waiting to be <br/>\nsent box first and then sign off and sign back on. Then it would take forever <br/>\nto send just one. If I tried to send it the normal way, the little hourglass <br/>\nthing would pop up and never go away and the computer would just freeze. AOL <br/>\ninformed me it was an internal glitch and they would have it fixed soon. Soon <br/>\ntook two weeks. Another thing I have noticed is that it used to be that if <br/>\nsomeone had quoted someone else&#39;s post there were little marks to note that. Now <br/>\nthere are none. Sometimes by the time I get someone&#39;s first post, five other <br/>\npeople have responded to it and I get their responses to a post I haven&#39;t even <br/>\nreceived yet. Very confusing! OTOH, my sister in PA is having no problems with <br/>\nhers.
