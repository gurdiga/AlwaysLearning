Every morning you&#39;d see kids in little white uniforms, with short trousers, and baseball caps walking to the school. It was essential that they weren&#39;t alone. A child alone was a child who was targeted. I stepped in once when a kid at a park we used to go to was harrassing a younger boy for his Pokemon cards. The bigger was pushing him and taking the cards out of his bike basket. David went to high school in Tokyo. He went to an international school there. Many of the other students were Japanese but couldn&#39;t get by in the Japanese schools because of bullying, often because they were second generation Korean of some other non-Japanese descent. Difference is really discouraged in Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever Japan advertises about the success of it&#39;s school system, there is a lot of damage being done within those walls. David organised a conference while he was working in Japan, it was on what we can find out about mating patterns in prehistoric populations. One of the people he invited to speak is a professor at St. Andrews, he&#39;s the head of the Perception Lab there, oh, you can see his picture at : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/lect/dp.shtml,\">http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/lect/dp.shtml,</a> which is relevant. He has multi-coloured hair. He told me that he used to just dye it one colour but he&#39;d run through all the colours so he was moving through 2 colours to see how long he could go without duplication. He figured he&#39;d be on three at some point in the nearish future. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s at 3 yet. Anyhow, his appearance really pissed off the Japanese at the conference. They wouldn&#39;t listen to him. He couldn&#39;t possibly have anything valuable to offer if he had such a radically different<br/>\n appearance. David walked with him in downtown Kyoto one night and he turned heads everywhere he went. Difference is not something to aspire to, or to even just be. If you are different in any remarkable way life is not going to be easy for you in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last point about Japan. We lived in these lovely apartments on the campus of the Nichibunken (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/info/facility/house_e.html)\">http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/info/facility/house_e.html)</a> where all the foreign faculty were housed. I can remember taking a cab with one of our neighbors and listening to him criticize the intractibility of the Japanese. One of his examples, which has stayed with me, was that 99% of people accused of a crime are convicted of that crime in Japan. A quick search with google shows that in Toronto 76% of those accused of homicide were convicted of their crimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------snip----------<br/>\n<br/>\nSerendipitously, yes. Japan&#39;s public schools are highly regimented.<br/>\nThe method of lecture-recitation, which generally has been discarded<br/>\nand derided in the USA, is Japan&#39;s norm. Teachers in Japan are given<br/>\nonly four hours in-class daily so that they may devote more time to<br/>\npreparation and grading. Japanese students have longer school days<br/>\nand school years, and parents often supplement the public education<br/>\nby enrolling their children in evening and weekend tutoring sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the result? The Japanese out-score the US graduates on all<br/>\nreliable tests of language, math, and social sciences. It&#39;s widely<br/>\nknown that Japanese factory workers can do algebra while their US<br/>\ncounterparts can&#39;t. And so forth.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nIt seems that for most young children, a Japan or KIPP-style<br/>\nenvironment is essential for learning. Does it necessarily squelch<br/>\ncuriosity or some other prized capacities? Doesn&#39;t have to: I&#39;d<br/>\nguess that the Japanese are overdoing it, and that greater success<br/>\nwould come from a balance of regimented class time and free time with<br/>\nloose supervision/ consultation.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337265206,"authorName":"Brad","from":"&quot;Brad&quot; &lt;bhmjones@...&gt;","profile":"bhmjones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Need expert help here.","postDate":"1233237435","msgId":41591,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsc2NqcisxMDczNkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdsa2I0MytsZWoxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41588,"nextInTopic":41596,"prevInTime":41590,"nextInTime":41592,"topicId":41453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You guys think pretty much the same way as I do about this stuff.

Once upon a time, that was the<br/>\ncase.  And it&#39;s doubtful that it was a sorry sad place to inhabit due to the<br/>\nlack of books, though some may believe that it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who are readers may feel that not only do books exist but also are a<br/>\nmarvel in themselves and can create worlds of imagination to immerse in as<br/>\nwell as describe the world we live in and the things in it, how they look,<br/>\nhow they work and so on.  But books, and other print materials, don&#39;t make<br/>\nthe world to exist or operate.  They are a part of the world, and can show<br/>\nus all manner of things about the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimarily though, the world itself helps us learn about it, many times in<br/>\nimportant very different ways than learning from books.  Imagine a doctor<br/>\nwhose means for learning about surgery were *only* from books *without*<br/>\nexperiencing surgery in the real world.  I prefer the doctor who has learned<br/>\nfrom many avenues of experience, including books, and I&#39;m thinking that a<br/>\ngreat many of us do too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How would we institute &quot;unschooling? &quot; Would it be through a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>combination of parental responsibility and public schooling? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInstituting &quot;unschooling&quot; would be superfluous since it&#39;s already the<br/>\nnatural way for anybody to learn, for instance when babies learn to talk and<br/>\nwalk.  It has been instituted already by nature.  It would not be through<br/>\nparental responsibility or public schooling, both of which exist already<br/>\nalso, and for other purposes.  True, parents can enrich a child&#39;s<br/>\neducational possibilities through choosing options that widen the range of<br/>\nlearning opportunities or ruin a child&#39;s educational possibilities by<br/>\nlimiting such options.  In unschooling, parents are the facilitators of<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would seem that someone is ruining a child&#39;s education by not enforcing<br/>\nearly learning of how to read but see the above.  Children are learning<br/>\nalready by observing the way the world works.  Reading adds to learning in<br/>\nmany ways.  For children, those ways are not their ways but someone else&#39;s<br/>\nways.  That&#39;s an automatic problem with reading.  Someone else has the<br/>\nconclusion and once the child reads it, that conclusion is, at least in the<br/>\nearly days of reading, supposed to then belong to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrast reading to simple observation, which enables children to learn in<br/>\ntheir own ways and to create knowledge for themselves through experience.<br/>\nFor instance, Karl noticed something after licking the lid of a yogurt<br/>\ncontainers and said &quot;All things become new ... (big pause) ... when you<br/>\nclean &#39;em.&quot;  I didn&#39;t seize the learning moment and say, as I could have,<br/>\nthat yes we recycle things by cleaning them and getting them ready for<br/>\nreuse.  To me, the important thing about that learning moment is that Karl<br/>\nknows he can create knowledge from experience just like he knows how to<br/>\nbreathe, and he does it without thinking about how to learn.  Learning just<br/>\nhappens.  The kid who goes to school and is sat in front of the printed word<br/>\nday after day as a matter of course may not ever come to know learning like<br/>\nthat, even though it &quot;just happens&quot; for that kid too.  A great many kids<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the same confidence as Karl has in his own ability to learn and<br/>\nto think what he thinks.  Many children who are made to read first before<br/>\nthey can tackle real learning are convinced instead that they must be shown<br/>\nhow and what to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need expert help here.","postDate":"1233003383","msgId":41466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCOTkyOTAzLTJGMTItNDg2My04NEIwLUUwRTJEMURCNjg3OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEY1MEM3NEJCRDgxNjRENTE5Q0NFRUYwNjdGNjM4QUFCQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGdsa2I0MytsZWoxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjUwQzc0QkJEODE2NEQ1MTlDQ0VFRjA2N0Y2MzhBQUJAUm9ieW5QQz4="},"prevInTopic":41465,"nextInTopic":41470,"prevInTime":41465,"nextInTime":41467,"topicId":41453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Does this person have any kids?

Maybe if he stopped thinking of people as &quot;students&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is seeing learning as in service to education. I see learning as an <br/>\nautomatic and unavoidable function of the human brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is seeing learning as the first step towards doing, rather than a totally <br/>\nintertwined process of the doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is seeing education as end product oriented. I think of unschooling as <br/>\ntruly vocational because Jayn&#39;s life is all about *doing* her stuff, right <br/>\nnow and today. Even what might look like learning for it&#39;s own sake - Jayn <br/>\nspending time on the internet looking at vintage Barbie dolls for example - <br/>\nit isn&#39;t about wanting to learn or know about Barbies for her. That <br/>\nknowledge and learning is a side effect of her *appreciating* the beauty of <br/>\nthe things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe thinks people need to be motivated to learn. My daughter doesn&#39;t, but if <br/>\nsomeone wanted her to demonstrate her learning in a schooly way, that might <br/>\ntake some tough motivating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never worry about Jayn&#39;s learning, because it is automatic. I don&#39;t expect <br/>\nher to be a happy end product. I try to find ways to allow her joy to flower <br/>\ntoday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never consider discovering Jayn&#39;s interests as an unsolved mystery because <br/>\nher interests are right out there in her daily conversation and life and <br/>\nactivities. Plus as Schuyler mentioned we do a lot of strewing. Perhaps if <br/>\nJayn were trapped in a school room, even a kitchen table school room, her <br/>\ninterests would not be visible and obvious, but drowned in a sea of <br/>\nirrelevant school static, and would need ferretting out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this person have any kids?

I don&#39;t rest on my laurels waiting for Simon and Linnaea to approach me with what they want from the world, I offer stuff forward. I strew ideas, people, places, things. Our lives are filled with things I think will amuse. Sometimes they work, sometimes I get it so right that it fills them up for ages. Sometimes not so good. But that&#39;s just as much information as the successes are, even if less value for money. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading is a tool, it isn&#39;t a prerequisite. Curiousity is a prerequisite. I can squash their curiousity by pushing things upon them that they aren&#39;t interested in. If, as Simon has said, they want to be marine biologists, I can talk about all the hurdles that I think they&#39;ll have to jump to make that happen. I can get a bunch of texts on marine biology, look into the pre-reqs of comparitive anatomy, make a day at the beach a study in shells and dead crab dissection. Or I can strew magazines and episodes on Discovery channel. I can get an aquarium and help them set it up with fish to watch and maybe breed. I can help keep them curious and interested, and allow that interest to wane without any dissapointment on my part that they won&#39;t be a marine biologist one day. They were the day we got an aquarium (we don&#39;t have one, that&#39;s supposition and hopefulness on my part). They were the day we snuggled up watching sharks kill seals on Animal Channel. They were<br/>\n when we found razor shells on the beach. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife is huge and knowledge is almost equally vast. How we experience marine biology can be with our shoes off, paddling about in the water, watching the jellyfish in the tide pool, trying to figure out how they move and sense, or it can be from books and lectures, or in so many other ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Brad &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhmjones@...\">bhmjones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 26 January, 2009 12:42:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Need expert help here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently in a discussion with this guy about unschooling and do<br/>\nnot want to give erroneous information.
