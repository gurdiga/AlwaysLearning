So we have a sand and water tray, paints and craft materials displayed in open shelves as well as lego, puzzles and other toys and small tables and chairs they can use to paint/make things.

They also enjoy snuggling and being close to us and watching videos or playing games on their tablets with us. If your children have been in pre-school for some time you may be feeling a bit disconnected from them and they might be feeling the same.

What you want to work towards is creating an environment where they can explore their interests. You want to create the environment they would create for themselves if they had your knowledge about the world and an understanding of who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nShift your role right now to getting to know who they are. And giving them some space to find out who they are too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of books do they like? What kind of TV shows and movies? What do they like to do? Right now your understanding may be sketchy. As is theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nBuild on what you know they like. Then add in things they haven&#39;t yet experienced. Dancing. Singing. Tractor pulls. Classical music. Beatles. Puppet shows. New playgrounds. Soccer. Indian food. Walks in the woods. Bake cookies. Blow bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Young unschoolers","postDate":"1434556480","msgId":75985,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0MzUwMzE5LTUwRTEtNDdDOC1CQzBCLTcyN0YzOTc2N0IzOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75987,"prevInTime":75984,"nextInTime":75986,"topicId":75985,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"2 of 6, of someone s beginning questions, and a comment by me after _______________________ Young unschoolers I have twin daughters about to turn 5 next month.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1023533436\">2 of 6, of someone&#39;s beginning questions, and a comment by me after<br/>\n_______________________<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\nI have twin daughters about to turn 5 next month. What does unschooling look like at this age? Do I take them places/fieldtrips to find out if they&#39;re interested or not? They have been in preschool for 2 years and I&#39;m expecting that after deschooling they will have interests of their own, but right now it&#39;s as if they have no idea what they want or are interested in. <br/>\n__________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does life look like for four year olds?<br/>\nWhat would you like for life to look like for them?<br/>\nWhat would you like to have done when you were that age?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Do I take them places/fieldtrips to find out if they&#39;re interested or not?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDO you take them places?  Have you take them places in the past, or did you expect preschool.... (they were in preschool when they were two years old!?) to provide their access to all the world outside your house?

It means a foray outside of the school.  Even when professors use it, it means going out where normal people are, or musicians, or lizards.  <br/>\nWithout school there can be no extra-curricular activities.  Without school, there can be no field trip.  Step away from the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you take them places, don&#39;t do it to find out if they&#39;re interested or not.  ONLY take them to interesting places.  YOU make it interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it&#39;s as if they have no idea what they want or are interested in.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you don&#39;t know, why do you expect them to know, at the age of four?<br/>\nIf you step carefully into unschooling now, and don&#39;t screw it up, they might want to be right where they are, and be interested in everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75986,"nextTopicId":75992}}
