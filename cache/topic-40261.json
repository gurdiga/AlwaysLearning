Tails walked over and hug-fell into my arms.  I <br/>\nwrapped my arms around her and kissed her beautiful stinky hair (I&#39;m gonna <br/>\nmiss when she washes it more thoroughly - it&#39;s a smell that is uniquely my <br/>\ndaughter).   Tails is the height of Beth Fuller now so I&#39;ve only got a year <br/>\nor so where she&#39;s small enough for this type of hug, so I closed my eyes and <br/>\ntook in the moment.  When I opened my eyes (still in our hugging embrace) I <br/>\nsaw a mom looking at us.  Her expression was full of what I thought was <br/>\nlonging and I had this feeling she was saying to herself, &quot;I wish I had <br/>\nthat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m wrong with my thoughts but the moment was one that I <br/>\nwon&#39;t forget.
