I pulled him aside and talked to him and really what came up was that he was scared he couldnt do what the other kids could so he didnt want to try it.  I talked to him about fear and everyone has to start at the some point and I know how hard it is but sometimes if the only reason we are not doing something is cause we are afraid, it is good to atleast give it a try etc.... he still resisted.

On the  <br/>\nfirst shift he was supposed to have worked, he ditched out.  He stayed  <br/>\nup late talking to a friend who had come to town unexpectedly (and  <br/>\nelsewhere, not at our house) and when the time came, he decided not to  <br/>\ngo to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was mortified.  I was a doomsayer.  I was ashamed.  I thought &quot;this  <br/>\nis it,&quot; the beginning of the end, he&#39;s not a good person, no one will  <br/>\never trust him again, they trained him for nothing, he took that money  <br/>\nto learn a job they wouldn&#39;t let him do now even if he wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery quickly he got a job in a call center.  A secret job.  People who  <br/>\ntrained with him there were getting fired for telling what they did in  <br/>\npublic.  I had mentioned it on my blog and Kirby said &quot;take it down  <br/>\nright away!  Take it down or they&#39;ll fire me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat job turned into the one he has now, working for Blizzard.  He was  <br/>\nworking for a contractor providing World of Warcraft support.  That  <br/>\nwas the big secret.   But when Blizzard created its own support center  <br/>\nin Austin, they took applications to go there.  At first, Kirby had no  <br/>\ninterest in moving.  He liked living at home, he loved Albuquerque.   <br/>\nThe first day after the announcement he was in &quot;I&#39;ve lost my cool job  <br/>\nmode.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second day after talking to friends and family and co-workers, he  <br/>\nthought maybe he would at least talk to the recruiters.  So he put his  <br/>\nname on the list, figuring if he didn&#39;t like the new deal he wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way it worked was the recruiters already had a list of the people  <br/>\nthey most wanted, based on their stats (how helpful, how quick, how  <br/>\npleased customers were with their knowledge).  They were willing to  <br/>\nconsider other people too.  They didn&#39;t say they had that list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone applied for Austin they got an interview, if they  <br/>\nweren&#39;t on the list.<br/>\nIf they applied for Austin and they were on the list, they didn&#39;t even  <br/>\ninterview them except to show them the contract they were offering  <br/>\nthem and answer questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey paid for him to move, he has medical benefits and paid  <br/>\nvacations.  He&#39;s respected and happy.  His roommate gives him mushy  <br/>\nspeeches periodically.  They moved together from an apartment to a  <br/>\nhouse, but the roommate said if they moved and Kirby didn&#39;t want to go  <br/>\nwith him, he would live by himself rather than have another roommate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had succeeded in persuading him to go to Olive Garden and grovel  <br/>\nand get that job, he wouldn&#39;t have the job he has now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to practice with that kind of knowledge in small ways that  <br/>\ndon&#39;t involve moving to Texas, but when the relationship is first and  <br/>\nthere&#39;s some trust (even though I remember feeling that day that my  <br/>\ntrust had been unfounded and the world would end), life is better for  <br/>\nall.  And the relationships survive and strengthen rather than the  <br/>\nparent gambling the whole thing on one controlling moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":429410180,"authorName":"Stephanie LaBarge","from":"Stephanie LaBarge &lt;stephanielabarge@...&gt;","profile":"threegirlmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Breathe, and let it go.","postDate":"1273232390","msgId":53920,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1MzgzNi40MTkyNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTM5MTIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRTNEMzhGLjIwMDA1MDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhydm9mYytrY2pjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEJFM0QzOEYuMjAwMDUwNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":53918,"nextInTopic":53922,"prevInTime":53919,"nextInTime":53921,"topicId":53910,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are also in our first weeks or unschooling, and I m trying to make gradual changes, and the area that I m having the most difficulty unschooling me is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1712860657\">We are also in our first weeks or unschooling, and I&#39;m trying to make gradual changes, and the area that I&#39;m having the most difficulty &quot;unschooling me&quot; is having limits on things.  My daughters have always had a time limit on the computer, and I want to relax those limits some, but I definitely feel like at this point that they would choose to be on the computer constantly.  Yesterday was frustrating because my father called and was ill and needed me to take him to the doctor, and my 8 yo daughter gave me such a hard time about getting dressed and leaving and I had to ask her several times to log off the computer.    I was frustrated because she cared more about the game she was playing than helping me make sure her Papa was ok, but I know that she&#39;s 8 and was seeing it from a different perspective and today I know that I could have handled it more gently.  I want to be able to handle situations like this in a more gentle, mindful way.  In the past I<br/>\n would take away computer privileges for a time because she didn&#39;t listen, but especially with her I can see how that is not helpful.  Sometimes I just don&#39;t know what to do!  She is my quieter more easily wounded kid who holds things in, and I so much want to keep our relationship connected and not adversarial.  So I think that &quot;breathe and let it go&quot; is the first step, but I&#39;m afraid that relaxing the limitations might make the problem worse, at least for a while, so I&#39;m looking for insights both on how to take steps to relax the limitations and how to approach situations where my children are not listening to me and in the past would be disciplined-- I think there is a better way?<br/>\n Stephanie in Upstate NY<br/>\nMom to Lauren (10), Sophia (8) and Hallie (5) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Fri, May 7, 2010 4:47:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Breathe, and let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/6/2010 5:56 PM, KimWW wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice on how to get to Unschooling Me first, or will it just take <br/>\n&gt; practice?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.

I don&#39;t feel like learning any other language.<br/>\n<br/>\nOld me...You will sit down and do this!<br/>\n<br/>\nMore relaxed me...Why?  Is there some other language you are more interested in?  We can work with whatever you choose.  I promise we can work out the microphone troubles.  Your sisters loved it.  you might like it if you give it a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling Me...OK then.  It is here if you ever decide you&#39;d like to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to admit it, but I started on More Relaxed Me when she and I were discussing it. (But at least it wasn&#39;t Old Me!)  After a few moments I had to take a breath, realize I wasn&#39;t unschooling (I did think about you all.) and let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part isn&#39;t the &quot;$400 software!&quot;  After all, I didn&#39;t pay the $400.  The hardest part is that I LOVE to study languages, ANY language.  I am having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that she doesn&#39;t.  Breathe, and let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs weird as it sounds, starting to unschool and needing to tell myself to let things go is actually being GOOD for my blood pressure.  Goodness knows, &quot;Sit down and do this!&quot; wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how to get to Unschooling Me first, or will it just take practice?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\nKimWW</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53923,"nextTopicId":53919}}
