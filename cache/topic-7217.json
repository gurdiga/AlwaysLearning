I have a question about Oregon.  I would absolutely love,<br/>\nlove,<br/>\nlove to move to Oregon...specifically Portland or Lake Oswego.  And you<br/>\nlive<br/>\nin Lake Oswego and moved from California .  Here�s my question; how have<br/>\nyou<br/>\nadjusted to the lack of sunshine?  That is the only thing stopping us<br/>\nfrom<br/>\nmoving from Southern Cal.  I have visions of weeks and weeks with no sun.<br/>\nIs that the case?  How do you adjust?  Do you get depressed?  Portland is<br/>\nalways rated as one of the best places to live and lots of people just<br/>\nlove<br/>\nit, but what about <br/>\nthe sun!!! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIsabel&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Isabel<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I love the rain and even bemoaned the lack of it in San Diego so it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t too much of an adjustment for me.  I have had one episode of<br/>\ndepression that I can remember and thankfully we had a couple days of sun<br/>\nright then.  I mentioned this to my doctor and she said that even when<br/>\nit&#39;s overcast you get the benefits of the sun if you go outside for a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOregonians do everything in the rain; mow the lawn, eat outside (under a<br/>\ncover), go for walks, etc.  There are a lot of available indoor<br/>\nactivities and people here seem to look forward to the winter months as<br/>\ntheir time to cocoon.  Some of my friends have a few full spectrum lights<br/>\naround the house, they say it helps so I&#39;m gonna give it a try next<br/>\nwinter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy one recommendation would be to find a place which offers the kids some<br/>\nspace to move.  I live in a small space but I try to keep a space in my<br/>\nliving room for jumping, wrestling, etc.  My furniture is open ground for<br/>\nclimbing and jumping.  However, kids don&#39;t seem to mind playing in<br/>\njackets, gloves and rain boots either.  We have a membership to the<br/>\nChildren&#39;s Museum which is good for a few hours of wandering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a long summer here too with a lot of sun and temps around 80,<br/>\nsometimes around 100 but not for long periods.  Lake Oswego is a pretty<br/>\nlittle town but the lake is not a good choice for swimming, very silty<br/>\nand leeches.  There are plenty of indoor pools available though.  We are<br/>\nnot actually &quot;in&quot; Lake Oswego even though our address says we are, it&#39;s<br/>\nmore like Lake Grove.  We are just across the freeway from Tualatin and<br/>\nTigard and it&#39;s only about 10 minutes in different directions to<br/>\nPortland, Beaverton, Oregon City and Milwaukee.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
