We <br/>\n  kept letting him play Nintendo! We kept him supplied and fed and at <br/>\n  peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree totally - The only reason we were researching job requirements was Zac wanted to - he was wondering what is actually out there and he was thinking it took a college degree to get anywhere that pays well.  I really wanted him to see the flip side - that it would not necessarily take a college degree - depending upon what he wants to do of course.  If he wanted to be an emergency room nurse he&#39;d have to  get a degree.  If he wanted to be a paramedic - that takes a different type of program/schooling.  My sister is a nurse for babies at the local Children&#39;s Hospital - loves the job - college was the only avenue to that job.  BUT I wanted him to see the vast opportunities in addition to / instead of college.  I think he sees most all the local homeschoolers in our group - especially the unschooled ones for some reason - go to college early like around his age and he is beginning to think about things like this and explore options.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lego&#39;s were a focus for the discussion that he was interested in exploring in depth at this moment in time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday he was fanaticizing about if he had enough money he could start a wild animal rescue place - where people have wild (non-domesticated) animals such as tigers as pets and then figure out they cannot manage them nor their expenses so they end up at rescue places.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He dreams and talks the same as we do.  You know a lot of those: &quot;IF .....&quot;  or &quot;I would do .......&quot; conversations or &quot;It would be neat if I  .........&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also want him to realize that what he chooses to do is not the path he must stay on - like the corporate lawyer that chose to change and do Lego art.  If he does one thing and then he changes his mind that is fine too wether it is 1 year latter or 10 or 20 years later - change is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n  Maybe what your son will want to do doesn&#39;t exist yet, but Lego will <br/>\n  still be a step toward it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  exactly!  Could be - who knows?  Or maybe he&#39;ll play Lego&#39;s with his kid/kids really well someday ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think more likely, most companies hire people, and the value of a <br/>\n  person is made of all the things he knows and likes and is confident <br/>\n  about and competent in.

Not many more have something different and more <br/>\n  interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra <br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree,  this is the type of information we are trying to share with him as he explores.  Again, Thank You for helping us give words to some of our thoughts and helping us to help him explore.

That enjoying what you do is much more important.  He is 14 and just starting to explore various points of view I think.  When we asked him why he thought that a college degree was necessary, he said something about that is what he hears on TV and all over the place.  He has never ever heard it from us, though we did tell him that if he chooses to go we will help if he wants it. We did brain storm all the various &quot;jobs&quot; / things he could do to &quot;make a living&quot; that do not require a degree.  I really think that conversation stimulated his wondering if and what jobs were available with Lego and the requirements - simply because he has been into Lego&#39;s this week.  Plus making Magic playing decks.  Our family room is covered with card stacks and Lego creations - he did leave a path to the back door though.  Some of this is why I was trying to help him explore what is available and what the requirements are.<br/>\n<br/>\n His dad and I have college educations - I &quot;use&quot; mine and his dad never has.
