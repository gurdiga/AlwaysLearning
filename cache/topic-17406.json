Because","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1288595492\">RAILROADS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,<br/>\n8.5 inches. That&#39;s an exceedingly odd number.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why was that gauge used?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because that&#39;s the way they built them in England, and English<br/>\nexpatriates built the US Railroads.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why did the English build them like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built<br/>\nthe pre-railroad tramways, and that&#39;s the gauge they used.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why did &quot;they&quot; use that gauge then?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools<br/>\nthat they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would<br/>\nbreak on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that&#39;s<br/>\nthe spacing of the wheel ruts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So who built those old rutted roads?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and<br/>\nEngland) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And the ruts in the roads?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to<br/>\nmatch for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were<br/>\nmade for Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel<br/>\nspacing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is<br/>\nderived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war<br/>\nchariot. And may the bureaucracies live forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So the next time you are handed a spec and told we have always done it<br/>\nthat way and wonder what horse&#39;s ass came up with that, you may be<br/>\nexactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just<br/>\nwide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now the twist to the story...<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two<br/>\nbig booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These<br/>\nare solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at<br/>\ntheir factory in Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs would have<br/>\npreferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by<br/>\ntrain from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the<br/>\nfactory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had<br/>\nto fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the<br/>\nrailroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as<br/>\nwide as two horses&#39; behinds.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the<br/>\nworld&#39;s most advanced transportation system was determined over two<br/>\nthousand years ago by the width of a Horse&#39;s Ass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  And you thought being a Horse&#39;s Ass was not important??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17376,"nextTopicId":17393}}
