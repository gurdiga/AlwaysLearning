One of my favorite things about it is that it is easy to<br/>\nhandicap games and you can play a game that is enjoyable for both<br/>\npeople even if you have very different skill levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing they are interested because of Hikaru no Go, right?  I<br/>\nloved reading (and watching) it.  That was what sparked an interest in<br/>\nGo for both my youngest brother and myslef.  I haven&#39;t played very<br/>\nmuch but I downloaded a program so that I could play on the computer.<br/>\nThe AI was pretty good - good enough to be a nice challenge for a<br/>\nbeginner, at any rate. This one:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smart-games.com/igowin.html\">http://www.smart-games.com/igowin.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Go boards,  my brother got really into it and ordered a<br/>\nbeautiful Go table (the thick ones with legs) and stones from Japan.<br/>\nIt is beautiful and very nice to play on. That table was rather<br/>\nexpensive, but the board he had before that was also very nice and<br/>\neasy to buy.  I have a Go board that I bought a long time ago and it<br/>\nis rather small and not that great to play with.  I think it is 12<br/>\ninches and a lot of Go boards that I saw when I searched online are<br/>\nthat size.  Too small.  The board feels very cramped and the stones<br/>\nare so small that you can&#39;t hold them the right way when you play (if<br/>\nyour daughters have seen Hikaru no Go, they will know what I mean).<br/>\nThis board is probably big enough to be nice to play on:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=013641\">http://www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=013641</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t own that board, but I have purchased things from that store<br/>\nbefore and I have been happy with the store as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope your daughters have fun - it is a neat game!<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Nov 29, 2008 at 2:05 PM, skyandmtns &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pennacres@...\">pennacres@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; JUmping in-My girls age 13 have been wondering about the Japanese<br/>\n&gt; game &quot;Go&quot;.
