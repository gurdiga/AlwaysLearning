When I was in 3rd grade, I remember being in the school <br/>\ngym for an assembly.  A student from my class got sick and vomited on the floor, pretty <br/>\nclose to where I was.  I was definitely a person who got sick seeing others get sick, and I <br/>\nvomited just a little bit--in my mouth.  I chose to hold my vomit in my mouth until our <br/>\nclass got back to the classroom, and to spit it out in the bathroom there.  This meant <br/>\ngetting in line with my class and trudging slowly through the halls with puke in my mouth.  <br/>\nI remember my feelings of worry and shame that I had thrown up, and how annoying it <br/>\nwould be for my teachers if they knew, and that I hoped they couldn&#39;t tell I had puke in my <br/>\nmouth during my walk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I think I felt shamed into obedience as a child, and my interperetation of <br/>\n&#39;obedience&#39; was very skewed.  Had I felt comfortable to just be myself, to feel my feelings <br/>\n(including sick ones) when they arose inside, I probably would have a. puked it onto the <br/>\nfloor or b. at least ran to a nearby bathroom to get it out and rinse out my mouth...How <br/>\nuncomfortable I must have been as a young child in school, how closed and shut down, to <br/>\nnot even feel free to throw up for fear of upsetting others...<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my deschooling process is reviewing moments like this in my head, with <br/>\ncompassion for the little girl I was, and for the things I thought I *should* be doing.  My <br/>\nmemories seem to continually solidify for me why unschooling is truly the best, most <br/>\namazing option for our life with River (who spits food out, onto the floor if I don&#39;t catch it, <br/>\nwhen he doesn&#39;t like something ;)--he&#39;s only 20 months old right now, but I will <br/>\nremember the spit food into my hand method as he grows and tries more foods!

He has had this awareness from the beginning,<br/>\n&gt; and by recognizing and encouraging this, we have communicated about his<br/>\n&gt; elimination from early on, and he now, at 20<br/>\n&gt;  months, tells me when he needs to go (saying &#39;pee), and I assist him with<br/>\n&gt; this at his request.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really only been a few generations worth where parenting has gone from<br/>\n&quot;of course they can&quot; (nurse, pee, think) to &quot;of course they can&#39;t&quot;, and not<br/>\nto be cynical, but usually it&#39;s because someone wants to profit from you.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this has got me to thinking about food, and how many of the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling discussions of food could come back to the idea that we are born<br/>\n&gt; with self-awareness when it comes to this issue as well<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBingo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really seeing now how nursing on demand, empowering kids to try foods<br/>\n&gt; at their leisure, and encouraging children&#39;s own observations about how they<br/>\n&gt; feel while/after eating various foods is all part of continuing to build on<br/>\n&gt; that innate awareness of their own bodies and selves...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly.

Sometimes it will take days for a reaction to<br/>\n&gt; occur--yet, with some foods there is a reaction within hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSame as with EC. Just keep communicating. I don&#39;t believe that &quot;verbal&quot; is<br/>\nrequired. =) I really think that kids have a special reserved communication<br/>\nchannel with their parents on some subverbal, intuitive level, and that all<br/>\nyou have to do is keep that open.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  And, for the most part, we currently avoid the foods that cause the<br/>\n&gt; reactions.  Would helping make the connections include saying things like,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Oh, you want a cupcake?  That one has wheat in it, and wheat can give you a<br/>\n&gt; rash--do you want to eat this cupcake that has no wheat instead?&quot;  I really<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t done a lot of talking about this issue with him, and would love some<br/>\n&gt; pointers on where/how to start!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in the blogpost, corn transformed Rowan into a complete nut;<br/>\nrunning around bashing his head into things, hitting, flailing; you could<br/>\nsee in his eyes that he was not happy with what was up, but wasn&#39;t able to<br/>\nstop. Think methamphetamine; it was really that violent a reaction. It took<br/>\nus a while to figure out that it was refined corn products doing it, and<br/>\nonce we did, we just communicated. &quot;This soda has corn syrup in it and will<br/>\nmake you crazy. If you get crazy, and you need help, just come in for<br/>\nhugs...&quot; Like that. And over time, he was able to figure out for himself<br/>\nthat 1) yes, it was the corn, we weren&#39;t lying to him, 2) more had more<br/>\nimpact, less had less, 3) sometimes he didn&#39;t want to deal with the crazies,<br/>\n4) sometimes the treat was absolutely worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nModelling helps too.

But his father does.<br/>\nSo we talked about how everyone&#39;s body is different, and everyone has<br/>\ndifferent tolerances to stuff. I can consume dairy with no problems, his<br/>\nfather can&#39;t. The really important part is to make sure that the child knows<br/>\nthat it&#39;s not that you&#39;re judging the food or its consumption, you&#39;re<br/>\njudging the reaction it has on the individual.

We ec River, and I believe (as many ec-ers do) that he had/has an inborn awareness of his own elimination needs.  Which is why he has been able to &#39;tell&#39; us when he had to go from so early on (we started at 3 months, although the next babe I plan to start ecing at birth!)  Really, the hardest part of the process for me was opening the connection to my instinctual-mama-self enough to really understand and offer the potty when he was telling me (with his physical cues and the telepathic feeling/mama-baby-connection I still can&#39;t explain in words) that he was ready (and wanting) to pee.  He has had this awareness from the beginning, and by recognizing and encouraging this, we have communicated about his elimination from early on, and he now, at 20<br/>\n months, tells me when he needs to go (saying &#39;pee), and I assist him with this at his request.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this has got me to thinking about food, and how many of the unschooling discussions of food could come back to the idea that we are born with self-awareness when it comes to this issue as well, especially if this awareness is supported and encouraged by the folks around us (namely our parents/guardians).  The awareness of how hungry or full we are, of what foods we need/want at which times (more protein or sugar etc.), these are all things that many of us adults are disconnected from (possibly because of our upbringings and cultures that emphasize separation between mind and body...)  I&#39;m really seeing now how nursing on demand, empowering kids to try foods at their leisure, and encouraging children&#39;s own observations about how they feel while/after eating various foods is all part of continuing to build on that innate awareness of their own bodies and selves...Your story of the flower cake just so clearly articulated this for me Laureen--I&#39;m<br/>\n just finding this all fascinating as I realize more and more about all these connections...Thanks for getting my mind rolling on this!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Well you have to help him with the connections, but 20 months was plenty old enough with Rowan. If the reactions are severe, the connection can be made.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would love to hear more ideas about helping make these connections with an almost-verbal toddler.  Sometimes it will take days for a reaction to occur--yet, with some foods there is a reaction within hours.  And, for the most part, we currently avoid the foods that cause the reactions.  Would helping make the connections include saying things like, &quot;Oh, you want a cupcake?  That one has wheat in it, and wheat can give you a rash--do you want to eat this cupcake that has no wheat instead?&quot;  I really haven&#39;t done a lot of talking about this issue with him, and would love some pointers on where/how to start!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for any and all ideas!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Like the moon, come out from behind the clouds!

We rarely had sugar treats in the house.<br/>\nI made the Halloween candy, that I was allowed to keep, last until<br/>\nEaster.  I hid it in my little desk in my bedroom and would take tiny<br/>\nnibbles off of pieces of candy each day.  We didn&#39;t get any &quot;sugar&quot;<br/>\ncereal, we didn&#39;t get cookies, unless my mom made them and put &quot;healthy&quot;<br/>\nstuff in them, we didn&#39;t get syrup on pancakes, my dad made his own out<br/>\nof berries from our garden, which tasted good, but still not my choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HAD to eat what I put on my plate.  I had to put a little of something<br/>\nof everything that was served onto my plate, wether I wanted it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this was for health reasons, and a direct reaction to the abject<br/>\npoverty my father grew up in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have all kinds of food allergies and sensitivities.  Which came first<br/>\non some of them?  Force and a connection of my psycological dislike of<br/>\nforce associated with those foods, or did I not want to eat those foods<br/>\nbecause I really shouldn&#39;t have been eating them because my body didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t ever get to know that.  Some of my food allergies are fixed and<br/>\nsevere, some of them aren&#39;t.  I had to land myself in the hospital to<br/>\nfigure it all out, rack up huge bills and file bankruptcy to absolve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t ever do that to my kids!  It&#39;s something I feel really strongly<br/>\nabout.  I have one daughter who has shown a sensitivity to dairy.  If<br/>\nshe wants to eat it, I let her.  We sympathize when she feels yucky, we<br/>\noffer alternatives that are equally as yummy.  My other daughter really<br/>\ncan&#39;t handle eggs, she avoids them totally because she knows it causes<br/>\npain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a whole big world of food and I&#39;m not going to limit it.  I<br/>\noffer more options, cool choices.  Sugar is the least of my concerns. <br/>\nParents make such a big deal out of sugar, but I&#39;ll tell you, my lack of<br/>\nsugary treats when I was a kid, didn&#39;t ensure healthy for me!  Perhaps I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve been healthier eating store bought cookies instead of pork<br/>\nchops, which I have a very very severe allergy to, something I hated to<br/>\neat when I was a kid.  My parents allowed me to drizzle raw honey on my<br/>\npork, so that I&#39;d eat it.  I&#39;m allergic to honey now too.  Guilt by<br/>\nassociation I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have huge food issues, and I&#39;m going to do whatever I can to avoid<br/>\npassing that on to my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sisters kids all have pretty severe allergies.  My sister hyper<br/>\ncontrols food, her kids were still sick.  She finally did a food allergy<br/>\ntest and it turned out that they were severly allergic to garlic.  If<br/>\nshe had given more choice and more power to her kids, they may have<br/>\nfigured it out on their own.  Her kids won&#39;t get to know their own<br/>\nbodies that way, they don&#39;t listen to their bodies, they listen only to<br/>\nMOM!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Sensitivities and Unschooling","postDate":"1227638926","msgId":40489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3MjU3OEE3LTg5MEUtNDU3OS04OUU5LTk3MkZFQzY4NkU2MEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDgxMTI1MDgwOXE2YmIwYTgxY2w4ODg0NzAxNmZhZjUxNzE4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDU4MjYyOC45ODcyOC5xbUB3ZWIzMjAwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxjNjQzODg0YzA4MTEyNTA4MDlxNmJiMGE4MWNsODg4NDcwMTZmYWY1MTcxOEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40488,"nextInTopic":40491,"prevInTime":40488,"nextInTime":40490,"topicId":40475,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- http://theexcellentadventure.com/elementalmom/2006/10/02/self- limiting-the-saga-of-the-flower-cake/ This is what I wrote about that stage in our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1454300192\">-=-<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theexcellentadventure.com/elementalmom/2006/10/02/self-\">http://theexcellentadventure.com/elementalmom/2006/10/02/self-</a> <br/>\nlimiting-the-saga-of-the-flower-cake/<br/>\nThis is what I wrote about that stage in our journey.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBeautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Sensitivities and Unschooling","postDate":"1227637058","msgId":40488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4RjA4OEM3LUZFMkMtNDIxMi1BNjc1LUIxNDkzOTA2Q0MxQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENPTDExMC1XMTYxNTkyMUU5OTFDRUM3RjZDREQxOEFEMEIwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDU4MjYyOC45ODcyOC5xbUB3ZWIzMjAwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxDT0wxMTAtVzE2MTU5MjFFOTkxQ0VDN0Y2Q0REMThBRDBCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":40486,"nextInTopic":40489,"prevInTime":40487,"nextInTime":40489,"topicId":40475,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think it would be irresponsible to fill the house with food that I know causes an allergic reaction or only buy food that is basically junk -=- When a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1137115288\">-=-I think it would be irresponsible to fill the house with food that  <br/>\nI know causes an allergic reaction or only buy food that is basically  <br/>\njunk -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a statement like this is made there&#39;s an implication that others  <br/>\ndo that and don&#39;t feel irresponsible about doing it.

I feel my 20 mo ds has sensitivities to some foods (due to some physical and behavioral reactions, including rashes, hives, irritability, nightwaking, etc.--thank you foodlab group!) Anyway, changing the diet in our household has made a huge positive difference (ds and I are *currently* gluten/dairy/ soy/corn and egg free). <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always very interested in this topic as it relates to unschooling (as I come to this area with my own food baggage as well. I&#39;ve forwarded both Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s food pages to other groups/friends when discussing food topics, as I&#39;ve learned so much about trusting *myself* and my child when it comes to food from this shift in perspective on the issue.) I&#39;d love to hear more about families who have children with food sensitivities in their homes and ways you all have partnered with your children in their learning about food...especially advice on the toddler years, as that is where we are currently. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I haven&#39;t felt the need to &#39;limit&#39; our diets at all, and have actually felt that the variety in our diet has grown due to my learning about so many wonderful foods I had never really explored before. (I&#39;ve grown to love cooking--something I thought I would never be interested in!) Also, there are so many substitutions that we can buy in the store or make at home that there is almost always an alternative that seems just as good as (or close enough to) old favorite foods. I don&#39;t feel like my son or I are ever deprived of foods, and I really try to make sure if we are going somewhere to bring a version of the food being served that fits (what I feel are) our current diet needs (ie, to a pasta dinner I&#39;d bring rice pasta w/ our own sauce, etc.) Although River seems totally satisfied with this, I worry at times that I am being too controlling about the issue--while at the same time I feel it is my role as his mother to provide/offer foods<br/>\nthat are going to be both yummy/appealing (to him) and healthful--not hurtful (the foods we avoid currently give him a rash on his bum that seems to make bowel movements extremely painful--avoiding the foods seems to erase this issue.) As he is only 20 months, I don&#39;t feel that it is realistic or appropriate (right now) to expect him to make the connection between a specific food he eats and a reaction which may not occur until the following day (like the bum rashes--which I feel are the *worst* reactions because they seem to be very painful), so I take this responsibility on myself. As he gets older, I know he&#39;ll be able to make that connection, but for now, I&#39;m just trying to provide a variety-filled environment in regards to food. How have you all done this, with your toddlers? I really try to follow his lead and prepare foods he likes/enjoys. He has definite preferences (as we all do) and I just try to follow these...I really want to partner<br/>\nwith him in this. Any tips on this topic are greatly appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I had a real ah-ha moment yesterday in the food arena, when he asked for his (r)ice cream (he&#39;ll run to the fridge and point to the freezer to tell me). I got him a dish of it, and was also cooking broccoli at the time. He took a few bites of the ice cream, but when he saw the broccoli, he ran to the stove and wanted it. He ate the entire crown with some salt and pepper, and left the rest of the ice cream to melt on the table. Something I might not have believed could happen before learning about the joys of *trusting* our children to make their own food choices...<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all in advance--I&#39;m learning so much from this list every day!<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Like the moon, come out from behind the clouds!

Anyway, we just fill our house with lots of &quot;safe&quot; food that covers the goodies to fruits and veggies. My kids so far just want the sweet or salty and it doesn&#39;t matter what brand it is or where it comes from. When we are out and about, it can get a little tricky but for the most part I always bring something that they can eat and it hasn&#39;t been a problem at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn a side note, we have been trying out enzymes as they &quot;claim&quot; to help food sensitivities. I am hoping at some point the kids can use them for times that they are out and want to try something that might give them a reaction.<br/>\n <br/>\nI personally believe that one should &quot;Set the stage&quot; but let those in the house choose for themselves. I think it would be irresponsible to fill the house with food that I know causes an allergic reaction or only buy food that is basically junk but I dont have arbitrary rules for where and when they can eat....or making sure they are eating exactly as I want them to. I know that I may disagree with some that we should just let them choose what they want at the store (I think that there is major marketing going on) but I do think they should have a choice and I will offer them an alternative I know is safe and possibly healthier. If I ever encounter resistance, then I will re-evaluate but so far there isn&#39;t any as long as their desire for whatever particular food sensation is satisfied. FWIW, my kids are 4 & 6.Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n EMAILING FOR THE GREATER GOODJoin me<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwayslearning@yahoogroups.comFrom\">alwayslearning@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yis4yoga@...\">yis4yoga@...</a>: Mon, 24 Nov 2008 21:18:32 -0800Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Food Sensitivities and Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been following (with great interest) the posts on food allergies/sensitivities. I feel my 20 mo ds has sensitivities to some foods (due to some physical and behavioral reactions, including rashes, hives, irritability, nightwaking, etc.--thank you foodlab group!) Anyway, changing the diet in our household has made a huge positive difference (ds and I are *currently* gluten/dairy/soy/corn and egg free). I&#39;m always very interested in this topic as it relates to unschooling (as I come to this area with my own food baggage as well. I&#39;ve forwarded both Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s food pages to other groups/friends when discussing food topics, as I&#39;ve learned so much about trusting *myself* and my child when it comes to food from this shift in perspective on the issue.) I&#39;d love to hear more about families who have children with food sensitivities in their homes and ways you all have partnered with your children in their learning about food...especially advice on the toddler years, as that is where we are currently. Right now, I haven&#39;t felt the need to &#39;limit&#39; our diets at all, and have actually felt that the variety in our diet has grown due to my learning about so many wonderful foods I had never really explored before. (I&#39;ve grown to love cooking--something I thought I would never be interested in!) Also, there are so many substitutions that we can buy in the store or make at home that there is almost always an alternative that seems just as good as (or close enough to) old favorite foods. I don&#39;t feel like my son or I are ever deprived of foods, and I really try to make sure if we are going somewhere to bring a version of the food being served that fits (what I feel are) our current diet needs (ie, to a pasta dinner I&#39;d bring rice pasta w/ our own sauce, etc.) Although River seems totally satisfied with this, I worry at times that I am being too controlling about the issue--while at the same time I feel it is my role as his mother to provide/offer foodsthat are going to be both yummy/appealing (to him) and healthful--not hurtful (the foods we avoid currently give him a rash on his bum that seems to make bowel movements extremely painful--avoiding the foods seems to erase this issue.) As he is only 20 months, I don&#39;t feel that it is realistic or appropriate (right now) to expect him to make the connection between a specific food he eats and a reaction which may not occur until the following day (like the bum rashes--which I feel are the *worst* reactions because they seem to be very painful), so I take this responsibility on myself. As he gets older, I know he&#39;ll be able to make that connection, but for now, I&#39;m just trying to provide a variety-filled environment in regards to food. How have you all done this, with your toddlers? I really try to follow his lead and prepare foods he likes/enjoys. He has definite preferences (as we all do) and I just try to follow these...I really want to partnerwith him in this. Any tips on this topic are greatly appreciated! On a side note, I had a real ah-ha moment yesterday in the food arena, when he asked for his (r)ice cream (he&#39;ll run to the fridge and point to the freezer to tell me). I got him a dish of it, and was also cooking broccoli at the time. He took a few bites of the ice cream, but when he saw the broccoli, he ran to the stove and wanted it. He ate the entire crown with some salt and pepper, and left the rest of the ice cream to melt on the table.
