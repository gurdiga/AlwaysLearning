I didn&#39;t worry too much, because he never complained about it and it didn&#39;t seem to bother him.   Washing his hair more did seem to help some (he did go through a phase of not wanting to wash his hair very often) but not entirely.

Our younger son (age 6 now) never had it.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting to hear that it might be related to a dairy allergy.  The son that had it is personally averse to most dairy (not allergic).  He does eat yogurt, but that&#39;s about the only dairy he has ever eaten on a regular basis.

There are spots of darker crud you can scrape away all over her scalp. If you try hard and don&#39;t mind pissing her off. :) She&#39;s just 5 this month, and my husband remembers being 6 and having his mom compulsively pick at his scalp. He HATED it. Once he became a beach kid around then with his hair wet for hours a day it went away. She definitely takes way more after him genetically. We never have bathed her much (usually 1-2 times a week unless she seemed to need it) since she had very dry sensitive skin, and doesn&#39;t want a bath often, and it didn&#39;t seem necessary. She gets a lot of art supplies and sometimes sand on her but not dirt. We regularly go a month or so without doing anything other than getting her hair wet. She HATES having her hair washed. The crud isn&#39;t itchy, and it doesn&#39;t bother her, so it&#39;s fine by me. I personally only wash my hair with baking soda once a week and you can&#39;t tell now that my scalp adjusted, so washing every day seems excessive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re about to change insurance, though, and I&#39;m a little concerned about looking to a new pediatrician like I am neglecting my kid. So my question is, has anyone else had experience with anything like this? I wish I knew whether this is just what happens with some kids when you don&#39;t wash their hair, but I don&#39;t want to force her into frequent hairwashing to find out. We don&#39;t have good pool access anymore or I&#39;d try daily swimming. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Alex<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mama to Katya <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247112349,"authorName":"michelle_m29","from":"&quot;michelle_m29&quot; &lt;mmarr@...&gt;","profile":"michelle_m29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Cradle cap/ scalp crud in 5 yo?","postDate":"1337464928","msgId":67223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpwOTU5MCtuYXRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpwNXM2cis3Y2RvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67222,"nextInTopic":67224,"prevInTime":67222,"nextInTime":67224,"topicId":67208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve spent the past few years struggling with crud on my own scalp.

We never have bathed her much (usually 1-2 times a<br/>\n&gt; week unless she seemed to need it) since she had very dry sensitive skin,<br/>\n&gt; and doesn&#39;t want a bath often, and it didn&#39;t seem necessary.
