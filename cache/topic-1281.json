Zen and The Art of Motorcycle <br/>\nMaintanence was a life altering book for me. Certainly set me on the path of <br/>\nadventure...he was such a COOL Dad!!<br/>\nMy dh recommended it to me when we were dating and loaned me his copy. I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s when I really fell for him.<br/>\nSpeaking of dh....he&#39;s been told (by perfect strangers) about four times in <br/>\nthe last month that he looks like Rick Springfield. I don&#39;t see it too much, <br/>\nbut it does wonders for his ego. He is a very good looking guy to moi, of <br/>\ncourse. A total musician type. I love it when he has his &quot;winter&quot; look of <br/>\nscruffy face and long hair. More typical is his business look though...short <br/>\nhair and clean shaven....DARN IT!!<br/>\nI liked the pretty boys when I had crushes. Luke, Scott Baio, Rick <br/>\nSpringfield definitely.<br/>\nSo what does that say about me?<br/>\nyikes.<br/>\nI love adventurous types in real life though, mountain climbing, skydiving <br/>\nadventure seeking men.<br/>\nHey, Luke was adventurous...maybe there is a little insight there!!! haha<br/>\nJulie,<br/>\nYour story parallels parts of mine. I was raised fairly conservative in many <br/>\nways. I&#39;ve always been fascinated with the whole homesteading thing. And I am <br/>\nalso a big Sandra fan!!!  <br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1298,"nextTopicId":1320}}
