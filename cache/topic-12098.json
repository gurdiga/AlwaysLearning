Can we talk later?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;But you said if I ever needed to ask you anything ...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;OK, OK. What&#39;s the question?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;A just war. How can any war be &#39;just&#39;?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ah. Yes. Good question. How did this come up, sweetheart?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;You know, like, Iraq and everything? I heard someone on <br/>\ntelevision - a <br/>\n&gt; bishop, I think he was - saying there is such a thing as a just <br/>\nwar. Did he <br/>\n&gt; mean a holy war?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, no, not exactly. A holy war is when people fight over their <br/>\nreligious <br/>\n&gt; beliefs. When they think they really have God on their side.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;But if they are fighting each other over religion, wouldn&#39;t they all <br/>\nthink <br/>\n&gt; God was on their side?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Absolutely, sweetheart. That&#39;s exactly what happens in a holy <br/>\nwar. But it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; rather silly describing any war as holy - war is ugly, brutal, <br/>\nviolent and <br/>\n&gt; repressive, and holiness is supposed to be about the opposite <br/>\nof all those <br/>\n&gt; things. Anyway, history shows us that war is a completely futile <br/>\nway of <br/>\n&gt; trying <br/>\n&gt; to settle conflicts. Some time in the future, I&#39;m sure people will <br/>\nlook back <br/>\n&gt; and wonder how humans could have been so stupid as to go <br/>\nto war over <br/>\n&gt; anything. <br/>\n&gt; No one ever really wins, but a lot of people suffer and the result <br/>\nnever <br/>\n&gt; turns <br/>\n&gt; out quite the way anyone intended. Never.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;So you&#39;re against war?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Everyone&#39;s against war, angel. How could anyone be in favour <br/>\nof killing each <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; other and destroying each other&#39;s cities and towns? You think <br/>\nwar is about <br/>\n&gt; soldiers, but innocent civilians, even children, are always killed <br/>\nin wars. <br/>\n&gt; Of <br/>\n&gt; course I&#39;m against war ... aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;So are you, like, a pacifist?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, no, not exactly, although part of me would like to be. I <br/>\nadmire <br/>\n&gt; pacifists, but I think there are times when there really is no <br/>\nalternative to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; fighting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;So that&#39;s what people mean by a just war?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I guess so. A just war is when you have to defend yourself <br/>\nbecause someone <br/>\n&gt; has attacked you. Or when a friendly country is attacked and its <br/>\nleaders ask <br/>\n&gt; you to help them defend themselves.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;So if America attacks Iraq and Iraq defends itself, that wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe a just <br/>\n&gt; war for America, but it would be for Iraq. And if Iraq asks one of <br/>\nits <br/>\n&gt; friends <br/>\n&gt; to help it defend itself against America, that would be a just war <br/>\nfor the <br/>\n&gt; other country, right?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple, I&#39;m afraid. There are such things as <br/>\ngood guys <br/>\n&gt; and bad guys, sweetheart. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy, so <br/>\nwe don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt; anyone would be justified in defending him.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;But if he doesn&#39;t attack anyone, how can invading his country <br/>\nbe a just war? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; According to you, invading another country would always be <br/>\nwrong.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, usually, but, see, everyone thinks Saddam has these <br/>\nreally awful <br/>\n&gt; weapons ...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Worse than America&#39;s?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Not worse, no. But, well, because he&#39;s a bad guy, people think <br/>\nhe might <br/>\n&gt; decide to use those weapons against some other country <br/>\nsome day, so America <br/>\n&gt; wants to invade his country and destroy the weapons before he <br/>\ncan use them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Has he threatened to use them? Like, who does he want to <br/>\nattack?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;He hasn&#39;t actually threatened to use them against anyone in <br/>\nparticular - <br/>\n&gt; except the Americans, of course, if they invade his country.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;And us? Aren&#39;t we going to invade Iraq, too? We sent some <br/>\nsoldiers off last <br/>\n&gt; week. I saw that on TV, too.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;No-one really knows, sweetheart. We mightn&#39;t actually be <br/>\nplanning to invade. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We might be just trying to scare Saddam into giving up his <br/>\nweapons. We might <br/>\n&gt; be calling his bluff.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;But if he isn&#39;t planning to attack anyone, wouldn&#39;t that mean <br/>\nSaddam won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; use his weapons unless he has to defend Iraq against an <br/>\nattack? So wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; attacking him be the best way of making sure he does use his <br/>\nweapons?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s logical, but I guess our Government must think there&#39;s <br/>\na huge risk he <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; will use them on, on ... on someone else if we don&#39;t get in first.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Our life skills teacher said the end never justifies the means. <br/>\nWas she <br/>\n&gt; wrong?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know, honey, I really don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;By the way, whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? I <br/>\nthought he was supposed <br/>\n&gt; to be the world&#39;s No.1 bad guy. Is Saddam even worse?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re both pretty bad. They&#39;re terrorists, see? They both <br/>\nplace a low <br/>\n&gt; value <br/>\n&gt; on human life.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hmm.
