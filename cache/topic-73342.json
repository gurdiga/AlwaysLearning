She&#39;s been saving and editing recent unschooling chats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a project to gather them all up that she&#39;s gently reminding me to finish, I&#39;ve just come to one from 1995, from the AOL forum.   It&#39;s not ready to share yet, but is about &quot;detox,&quot; recovering from school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t care if people disagree with me. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to agree with me blindly, nor disagree blindly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s still true. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now there are chat transcripts saved raw (not to share before they&#39;re edited, some have been edited and available for a long time, but not all easy to find, some are listed in one place or another.  Some people really enjoy chats better than &quot;composed&quot; pages.  i personally like the favorite quotes kinds of pages.  Some people prefer long essays.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s where some of the chats are linked, though, for people who are interested, and that first one has links to get to notifications of newer chats.  I think there are about twice this many edited and might be available at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chat\">http://sandradodd.com/chat</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chats/bigbook/directory\">http://sandradodd.com/chats/bigbook/directory</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand here&#39;s the construction site for getting them all organized in one place.
