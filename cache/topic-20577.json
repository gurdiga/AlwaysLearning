Weren&#39;t research reports originally<br/>\ndesigned<br/>\nfor doing...um...research on stuff? :-D ]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I interpret &quot;research report&quot; is writing up a<br/>\nreport on your research findings after you&#39;re done<br/>\nresearching.  I think that&#39;s why you were questioned<br/>\n-- on an unschooling list -- as to the point and<br/>\npurpose of having him write a &quot;report&quot;.  You hadn&#39;t<br/>\nclarified, at that point, that it was your DS who<br/>\nwanted to do this . . . it sounded to me like you were<br/>\ngiving him an &quot;assignment&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second the Consumer Reports suggestion.  Heck, you<br/>\nmight even find an issue that is fairly current that<br/>\nalready contains ratings on electric scooters!  heh<br/>\nheh<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, in response to your question above . . .<br/>\nno, research *reports* weren&#39;t invented for *doing*<br/>\nresearch but to report on your findings.  Up until<br/>\nthat point you&#39;ve got research &quot;data&quot; compiled.  :&#39;) <br/>\n<br/>\n-Tracy-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
