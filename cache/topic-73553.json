Heck the grocery store delivering would be nice! (And yes I know it&#39;s an option) I wrote to see what I could do to help them, when either were feeling iffy about going. My eldest really loves her friends, being with people, and that includes both online friends and physical. She wants physical friends and maintaining physical relationships requires visiting with friends. She really misses our neighbor we moved away from, and we don&#39;t live near anyone her age now, so if she wants to see people, we have to leave and meet them. (And we&#39;ve recently moved, so we don&#39;t know many people to invite over) Selfishly, I don&#39;t want her to miss out because I&#39;d rather stay home than put in the effort to help her get ready when she only kind of wants to leave the day of. (Like I said dressing, shoes, etc. are already easy, leaving the friends on the computer are not and that&#39;s where the help comes in from me) The reality is I like being home and we only leave because one girl or the other, maybe both, want to do A, B, and C when we talk about things we want to do, in the future. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learning -=how to decide if I really want to stay=- is it. And I feel like if I am pushing or pulling I am making the choice for them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve never thought about the term life lesson in terms of right or wrong. I had no idea the word came with so much extra, and it gives me food for thought on wording. Learning from staying home whenever, is that you&#39;d learn when you actually wanted to go and when you didn&#39;t. That to me is a life lesson, something learned from life experience not as a parental set-up or creation, and I don&#39;t see the answer from that as black and white nor right or wrong, only that you learn what works for you. And to choose to stay home and regretting you didn&#39;t go, or finding out you were so glad you stayed home because you had an awesome day at home, are two different not right nor wrong outcomes. That she would have for herself. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I feel when I am getting her ready when she only kind of wants to leave but would be happy staying at home is taking the choice away from her. But if helping her get ready and helping her through the transition isn&#39;t taking away her choice then I wanted perspective on it. I was seeking different perspectives on leaving the house. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was meant just as a question on how to help my daughter leave the house to do the things she wants but she will be leaving things she also wants to be doing at home. When she decides she would rather stay home, but kind of wants to go out maybe in an hour or so. This focus on black and white thinking, right or wrong lessons is deterring from my questions.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is it more cooperative to say hey do you want to go, be met with no, and go OK sounds good, or to say hey but maybe you&#39;ll have a great time, I&#39;ve done all the preparation? Or if there were any renditions of I wasn&#39;t thinking about. I&#39;m not trying to create something here, not a set-up, no chosen outcome. Just an answer to some options when met with a no, an iffy no, a maybe later.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steph<br><br><br><br><br></p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1583552311gmail_quote\">On Feb 15, 2014 10:13 AM,  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1583552311gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"\">\n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n\n\n      <p><span style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);\">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;is that a good lifetime learning lesson option&lt;&lt;</span><br><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);\"><br></span></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><span>If you&#39;re thinking in terms of lessons, you&#39;re not thinking about decision making or learning.

Really, really think about that, don&#39;t just reject it out of hand. A week isn&#39;t that long. Neither is a month, really. What if they Actually Enjoyed being home that much? What if you did?

At the same time, I&#39;m good at making the best of things - I can be charming and lively and have a great time socializing, or shopping, or sightseeing, or playing. Sometimes its worth it. Sometimes it&#39;s not. Sometimes I stay home and wish I&#39;d gone out. Sometimes I go out and wish I&#39;d stayed home. There&#39;s no lesson in that and no right answers. I&#39;ve learned to feel my way through each situation and decide rather than to make a kind of rule for myself &quot;go, you&#39;ll have a good time&quot;. I learned all that as an adult because as a child those decisions weren&#39;t mine to make.

If they need to get out of the house in something particular, change the night before, or the day before, or if you drive have a change of clothes in the car. I used to keep Mo&#39;s shoes in the car for exactly that reason - she didn&#39;t wear then around home, even outside, but needed them for going to town.

I really like projects and respect them being involved in whatever they are doing. We miss things and that is not a big deal. I wasn&#39;t meaning as a black and white issue, I was meaning more as a flexible option if they want to stay home we will type. I guess I shouldn&#39;t have used the term recluse. If our kids stayed at home each and every time they said, &quot;Na not this week,&quot; at some point, I am sure I would be met with eagerness to leave the house. What I am wondering is, is that a good lifetime learning lesson option? So rather than coming at it as an expectation, change it to an option so the night before I would tell them play meet up tomorrow if you want to go, and if yes ask again in the morning. We do our outings because they like to do them, but they don&#39;t want to go the day of. I&#39;ve also told them if we miss the class they take too often, we will have to withdraw from it, which is the reality.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m similar to Sandra, I want to go to the party, but when it comes down to it I am involved in other things, and it&#39;s like OK, Steph, get ready you&#39;ll have fun. And I can drag my feet, waiting until the last moment to get ready. Because I am like that, I would say I prepare for outings. And the only involvement I really do with our girls is reminders of when we will be leaving, and then at the very last they dress and we leave. It&#39;s easy getting them out. We have tablets, play games in the car, get food or bring food, needs are met. It&#39;s just the &quot;oh, do we really have to go? We&#39;d rather....&quot; that I am trying to address. And when it starts happening Most of the time, I am looking for new ways to get out of the house without that feeling. I feel like my staple, &quot;yes, we have to go now because your friends won&#39;t be home later, &quot;I am still met with, &quot;well how about next week?&quot;¬† and if we miss it this week, later in the week they tell me we should make sure we visit our friends next week, and we repeat the dialog next week. I feel like I am picking up a crying baby that is upset, taking him to an area that will make him happy, but he doesn&#39;t know it yet and he is upset with me for carrying him. The difference being, that they do know I am taking them someplace happy.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am going to try to be more inviting, add more positive reminders about what they will be doing, who they get to see etc. It may just be this is one of those things that happens to us in life that we struggle with and we just have to make it as nice as possible.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think I&#39;ll also see if I can enlist their help the night before in getting ready when they are wanting to go on the outing. Normally I do it all for them, but maybe enlisting their help will increase their desire to go, so they look forward to it knowing it&#39;ll be happening the next day. Because maybe the excitement from the last time we went to friends has worn off a bit, getting ready in advance will refresh that feeling.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steph</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":270927662,"authorName":"janine davies","from":"janine davies &lt;daviesj69@...&gt;","profile":"kessykoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reluctance to go out","postDate":"1392373398","msgId":73611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjQwNS1FQVMyMzdGQTZEQkJFQUU4RTQyMzU4NDk2MEE2OUMwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2NjU5MTJELUNDNEUtNDgzQi1BQzg3LTA0M0M4QTA0RTk1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzZFgwNEJ1OStxbkRfQ0wwSEJGZkRXRTEwUD1QSnYrRFRzUjh2SzB4QkxWZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDY2NjU5MTJELUNDNEUtNDgzQi1BQzg3LTA0M0M4QTA0RTk1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73579,"nextInTopic":73612,"prevInTime":73610,"nextInTime":73612,"topicId":73553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~ Don t push through, pull through. :-)  Be attractive, and draw them toward the thing/place/plan. ~ Thank you so much for this!

I mean, you&#39;re going out several times a week, I&#39;d hardly call staying home occasionally because someone&#39;s not in the mood or wrapped up in a project &quot;becoming a recluse&quot;. Don&#39;t see the situation as all or nothing. See that staying home is one of the options, and some days it will be a better option than others. Some days it could&nbsp;be better to be able to spend hours and hours on a project than dropping everything for an outing. If you&#39;re not seeing that possibility, then you could be closing yourself off to subtler cues - do you Always push them to go? It shouldn&#39;t be always, it should be conditional.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t mean you should make a big deal of asking &quot;do you want this? do you really? are you sure?&quot; about every outing - that&#39;s frustrating for anyone, to be asked to re-make the same decision over and over like that. Assume that if they&#39;re agreed to plans that they essentially want to go - but also be alert for the possibility that sometimes something else is more important. If you have sweet-tempered kids they won&#39;t make a big deal about something else being more important, they&#39;ll argue and complain a little, maybe, but then go along, leaving whatever it was behind and only getting an hour to do it later, instead of the six they actually wanted.&nbsp;<br><div><br></div><div>---Meredith</div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":559948216,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;lorna.laurie@...&gt;","profile":"lorna.laurie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reluctance to go out","postDate":"1392244616","msgId":73561,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxkZ3QyOCsxMmxoZTMxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2NjU5MTJELUNDNEUtNDgzQi1BQzg3LTA0M0M4QTA0RTk1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzZFgwNEJ1OStxbkRfQ0wwSEJGZkRXRTEwUD1QSnYrRFRzUjh2SzB4QkxWZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDY2NjU5MTJELUNDNEUtNDgzQi1BQzg3LTA0M0M4QTA0RTk1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73556,"nextInTopic":73572,"prevInTime":73560,"nextInTime":73562,"topicId":73553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow, that really puts their resistance in perspective...we re like that too!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1311604663\">Wow, that really puts their resistance in perspective...we&#39;re like that too!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reluctance to go out","postDate":"1392225525","msgId":73556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY2NjU5MTJELUNDNEUtNDgzQi1BQzg3LTA0M0M4QTA0RTk1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzZFgwNEJ1OStxbkRfQ0wwSEJGZkRXRTEwUD1QSnYrRFRzUjh2SzB4QkxWZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzZFgwNEJ1OStxbkRfQ0wwSEJGZkRXRTEwUD1QSnYrRFRzUjh2SzB4QkxWZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73553,"nextInTopic":73561,"prevInTime":73555,"nextInTime":73557,"topicId":73553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I see the options as: A.
