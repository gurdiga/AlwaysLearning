Frankweiler, the children don&#39;t live in a department store, they live in a museum. Terry Pratchett wrote a book called Truckers, which has little people living in a department store, but I don&#39;t think that was around 30 years ago. The couple of books that sprang to mind about attics are all about punishment. Oh, Heidi, I suppose she lives in a loft, I always wanted her bed to look out at the stars at night. David and I had a bedroom like that and it was fantastic in summer, but man, was it cold in winter. So we had a summer and a winter bedroom, very posh. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still &quot;choose your own adventure &quot; books. Simon likes them. Hmmm, maybe I should order some more of those. If you put that into a search at Amazon.com there are a lot listed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: a_roff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:a_roff@...\">a_roff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 2 October, 2008 12:30:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] books from my childhood - do you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling someone on this list might know: do these books sound <br/>\nfamiliar to anyone?
