As it affects the  <br/>\nchildren, don&#39;t put off getting help.  You don&#39;t want your school to  <br/>\nmess up their lives too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to heal is to imagine your childhood life if you had had  <br/>\nchoices (and then give your kids choices) and more attention (and then  <br/>\ngive them attention) and if people had cared more and listened.  Each  <br/>\ntime you&#39;re attentive and compassionate, imagine how it would have  <br/>\nfelt to your own childhood self if people had done those tiny, sweet  <br/>\nthings for you.  And don&#39;t wallow in it or get angry about it.
