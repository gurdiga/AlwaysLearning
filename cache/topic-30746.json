I regretted it almost","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2116452426\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in our second year of Life Learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI let my oldest DD, (now 7yrs), go to public kindergarten, when she <br/>\nwas 5yrs, in 2005. I regretted it almost every day she was there. <br/>\nWhen her personal safety was placed in jeapordy, right in front of my <br/>\neyes, that was when my decision to keep her out of the public school <br/>\nsystem, was locked in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince our &quot;Life Learning&quot; journey began, it&#39;s as if our new lives <br/>\nbegan. I feel as though it is not only my two daughters who are <br/>\nlearning, (7 & 2), but also I am learning/growing, right along with <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nI despise everything about public schooling. The <br/>\ntesting/labeling/grading/monitoring/confining/humiliation/bullying/cli<br/>\nques/failing/etc.! I want my children to have a better life! Public <br/>\nschooling hinders that in every way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough we are registered with a Homeschool board,(we have to in our <br/>\nprovince), I chose the &quot;Parent Directed&quot; program, this year. In our <br/>\nfirst year,/06, I chose the &quot;50% Teacher/50% Parent&quot; program. I found <br/>\nit to be more &quot;monitored&quot; than I first thought. Along with working <br/>\nwith &quot;workbooks&quot; and having to fax my daughters finished work to the <br/>\nteacher, (small amount at each months end), my DD and I both ended up <br/>\nfeeling &quot;burnt out&quot; within a few months. Hence my choice for the 100% <br/>\nParent Directed, basically &quot;Unschooling&quot;, as we can do whatever MY <br/>\nDAUGHTER CHOOSES. That is what I want for both my DD&#39;s. &quot;LIFE <br/>\nLEARNING&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe only just moved to our new town a few months ago, but we are <br/>\nalready linked up with the HS group out here. We just met a bunch of <br/>\nMom&#39;s and their kids yesterday actually, when we all went to the <br/>\nlocal Recreation Center, which has a HS Gym time alloted, 3 days of <br/>\nthe week. We already know we&#39;ll be going to the gym,as well as  <br/>\nswimming/skating, and other events we&#39;ll be planning.But they will be <br/>\nevents our children want to go to/do, not OUR choices, without their <br/>\ninput.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was getting squirrely, regarding our <br/>\nchildrens &quot;socilization&quot; issue. It&#39;s not an issue for ME, just for <br/>\nHIM. He&#39;s not 100% WITH me on the whole &quot;Life Learning&quot; choice, as he <br/>\nthinks,(he&#39;s deluded and in denial) that HE, &quot;didn&#39;t have any <br/>\nproblems in public school&quot;. Really honey? Than why were you and your <br/>\nfriends always taking off from class, to go DRINKING ,(we&#39;re talking <br/>\nHigh School here),in YOUR car, (as you were one year older because of <br/>\nFAILING a grade), and WHERE are all your &quot;Freinds&quot; now? Not a one to <br/>\nbe found. So your &quot;socialization&quot; arguement, in one that you are <br/>\nhaving, only with YOURSELF. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am 100% fine and having NO DOUBTS, that keeping my children out of <br/>\nthe PS system, is the BEST CHOICE. For them, and for me. I have to <br/>\nsay for me as well, because if I was the kind of woman who allowed my <br/>\nhusband to make our childrens education choice, I would be the one <br/>\ndoing all the work, while sitting at home ANXIOUS & WORRIED for my <br/>\nchildrens safety/protection/learning, every day! <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryday in our house, is now an ADVENTURE! We wake up, when WE want <br/>\nto, not when SOCIETY or a Public School system tells us we HAVE to. <br/>\nWe have our breakfast, which we take the time to enjoy, no &quot;wolfing <br/>\nit down&quot; and running down the street to get to &quot;class on time&quot;. (We <br/>\nlive just two blocks from the elementary school by the way. NO, <br/>\nliving two blocks from the PS, is NOT a GOOD ENOUGH REASON, to put my <br/>\nchildren, in Public School! We also live behind a car dealership. So <br/>\nyou obviously bought your car from there, right? The liquor store is <br/>\nright next to that car dealership. So you must be going there 5 times <br/>\na week, right? Well I DIDN&#39;T and I WON&#39;T!).It&#39;s about CHOICES people!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter breakfast, I ask my oldest what SHE is feeling interested in <br/>\nlearning about/doing today. She&#39;s a big dinosaur fan right now. And <br/>\neven though my husband thinks she&#39;s &quot;too obsessed&quot; with the &quot;Teenage <br/>\nMutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, he just bought her the new movie, (on DVD), <br/>\njust yesterday. She&#39;s still learning honey!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an avid reader/researcher, of John Holt. As well, I think Sandra <br/>\nDodd & Joyce Fetterol,(hope I spelled that right), are the most <br/>\namazing women/Mom&#39;s. I read through both of Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s <br/>\nwebsites, regularly. I also believe in Jan Hunts view of &quot;Respectful <br/>\nParenting&quot;. (Currently working on being less of an &quot;Ole Yeller&quot;. <br/>\nDidn&#39;t say I was perfect).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two DD&#39;s protection are the most important issue to me. Reason <br/>\nbeing, is that my oldest DD&#39;s twin sister, died in my 29th week of <br/>\npregnancy, in 2000. My surviving DD, was born at 35wks, and had to <br/>\nstay in the Neo-Natal unit, for the first 3 days of her life, due to <br/>\nbreathing issues. (She is perfectly healthy in EVERY way now!). I <br/>\nthen had three early miscarriages,in /02/03/04. I then gave birth to <br/>\nmy second DD, in Sept/05, only after taking medication for the first <br/>\n3 months of my PG, so as to not lose her as well. She is perfectly <br/>\nhealthy as well. All thanks to GOD! <br/>\n<br/>\nI am protective of my two DD&#39;s, because of the above reasons. My <br/>\nchildren are my greatest gifts from God. I am honored, to be their <br/>\nMommy. I believe, that being a Mother, is what I was born to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to reading/posting within this board!<br/>\n<br/>\nBless you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nChasey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30644,"nextTopicId":30755}}
