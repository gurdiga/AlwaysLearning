Basically both kids want what they want, which is the opposite of eachother and both kids meltdown when not getting their way. Riley reacts with aggression, Ashley with foul language and mean, hurtful words. Neither kid lets me physically remove them calmly. I try gentle tugs, arm wraps, hug walks. They both react with a phsical resistance. When asked to find a mutual solution, Ashley can not listen without interrupting her brother. He is great at listening and then trying to find a solution. She screams if asked to walk through a problem solving situation in the moment. Yuck for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving each kid in charge of their own room is an idea I have thought about. Will see how the whole family feels about this tonight. Ashley does have a computer in her room which is a family object. Seems to be what the fights generally are about to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you, off to lead an LLL meeting,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary h.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13061,"nextTopicId":13070}}
