It&#39;s really pretty amazing. If there is a plateau, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m anywhere near it, and yet everyday I seem to notice some small way in which I&#39;ve grown closer to the mom I want to be. I&#39;m in harmony with my children and it&#39;s as authentic as anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. Being with my children no longer requires the mental effort it used to. For example, when one of my kids used to ask me to play a video game or watch them play a game, it felt difficult for me--I didn&#39;t want to do it. I wanted to do what *I* wanted to do. Or if one of my kids wanted to do a messy project or play in the tub with lots of bubbles and water, I would only be able to think of the mess that I would *have* to clean up afterward.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Nowadays, I&#39;m moving past all of those negative thoughts. I enjoy watching my kids play their games and I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at playing video games myself :). I feel good knowing about what my kids are into and who their favorite characters are, the storylines they&#39;re interested in and the things they find funny. When a messy project or extra-fun bath time is proposed, I still feel a twinge of hesitation, but now, I notice it and move on. I look at their happy, eager, expectant faces and saying &quot;yes&quot; is so much easier. I look forward to the outcome of giggles, joy, good memories, and learning that come from the experience. And guess what? I always end up having a blast too! Turns out, my kids are really fun and interesting people and we really enjoy learning and being together.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">As the confines of my old way of thinking melt away, radical unschooling begins to blossom. I couldn&#39;t have rushed this--it is organic learning at its best. Everyday something new is revealed to me about myself that helps me be a better unschooler--who was I as a child, how did I feel, what made me feel safe? What would have made me feel safer, heard, and respected? I am at a place now where I&#39;m giving my children all the things I never got, and as a result, a deep healing within myself is pushing me forward to do better and be better! That&#39;s what I call a win-win :).</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-491561838gmail_extra\"><br clear=\"all\"><div><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\" style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"></span></font><font><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Warmly,</span><br></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"> </div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:book antiqua, palatino;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:book antiqua, palatino;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Megan</strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><br></div></font><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"></div><p style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\"><br></font></p><p style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\"><span></span><span></span><br></font></p></span></div></div></div>\n<br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-491561838gmail_quote\">On Mon, Mar 7, 2016 at 2:25 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...
