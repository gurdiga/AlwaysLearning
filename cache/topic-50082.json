WHY should we worry about what Waldorf  <br/>\nteachers make parents worry about?   Television WILL harm the peace of  <br/>\na Waldorf school.   No question.  Keeping kids quiet and in padded  <br/>\nenvironments and believing in fairies takes effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about natural learning in the real world.  The real  <br/>\nworld has television, movies, computers.  The real world has had  <br/>\nrecorded music for a hundred years.  The real world has only had  <br/>\nSteiner schools for a much shorter and much smaller-percentage-of- <br/>\ninfluence time and space.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteiner&#39;s beliefs are not a factor in my unschooling at all,  <br/>\nwhatsoever.  They&#39;re interesting because they&#39;re kinda freakish, and  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not uncommon for a potential unschooler to show up all  <br/>\nglossed over with Steiner fairy-dust, wanting us to say &quot;oooh,  <br/>\npretty!  We want to be more like you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258071506,"authorName":"zoie dubinsky","from":"zoie dubinsky &lt;avocadostew@...&gt;","profile":"avocadostew","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Waldorf","postDate":"1264518765","msgId":50082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0NTcuMTkzNzkucW1Ad2ViMTEyMDE0Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50086,"prevInTime":50081,"nextInTime":50083,"topicId":50082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have known people to join Waldorf with their children because it is where they felt they most fit in.

Two of the couples I know that have children at the Waldorf school are gay couples (one male Jewish couple and another female couple) Together, they have a total of 4 children enrolled at the school from kindergarten to grade 4. I think that depending on where you live, your acceptance into the Waldorf community based on your views or lifestyle at home could vary. Some schools will not even take you in if you have a TV, others don&#39;s care so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW--I had a trial day yesterday of letting my son do what he wanted all day. He watched a bit of TV, looked at pictures on the computer then left it alone and did puzzles and rand around all day. We had friends over in the morning. He went to bed at his usual time by CHOICE&gt; It was a good day :) Thanks for letting me see this way as a choice too.<br/>\n<br/>\nZoie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      __________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLooking for the perfect gift?
