We did it, and my <br/>\ndaughter (10) had a blast.  I haven&#39;t helped set this kind of thing up in a while because I <br/>\nthink of her as getting older (I&#39;m now knocking myself on the head --  LOL).  She loved it and <br/>\nwas so appreciative.  She loves to LARP and so she painted on full length greaves, a power <br/>\nnecklace, and wrist protection in addition to the walls--very fun.  In fact, she wasn&#39;t very <br/>\ninspired by painting the walls (flat surface, like paper), which is why we had moved away from <br/>\nregular painting, so having the freedom of painting herself made it sooooo much more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater tonight I&#39;ll see if she wants to look around the internet at armor together.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42526,"nextTopicId":42573}}
