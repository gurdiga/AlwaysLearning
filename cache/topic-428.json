To not help them out that way - to <br/>\nnot help them become aware of how their behavior is discourteous or downright <br/>\ndisruptive to what other people are trying to do that seems unfair to the <br/>\nkids. They&#39;ll miss out on stuff later, when people don&#39;t want to invite them <br/>\nover, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63839307,"authorName":"Janet","from":"&quot;Janet&quot; &lt;jefhdvm@...&gt;","profile":"jefhdvm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Shopping/money","postDate":"1007940539","msgId":428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGIwMWMxODEwOSRmMTUzNmRmMCQwMTAwYThjMEB1cHN0YWlycz4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDc5MjkzNTQuMjAxMC42OTY4Ni5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":472,"prevInTime":427,"nextInTime":429,"topicId":428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... it is disturbing others - not helping him gain that awareness isn t fair either.
