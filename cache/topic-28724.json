This goes right back to when my now grown <br/>\nup never unschooled daughter was a baby and I first became a stay-at-<br/>\nhome dad, so it&#39;s not strictly &#39;unschooling&#39; - but, if I might be so <br/>\nbold as to put it this way, it&#39;s my view that unschooling parents <br/>\nhave this right where conventional parents don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read something in a self-help book about the time I became a parent <br/>\nthat stuck with me because it resonated with my parenting philosophy <br/>\nof &quot;baby steps and continuous forward movement&quot;. Don&#39;t recall now who <br/>\nto thank for putting that idea into words for me, but this is from a <br/>\nguy called Ken Keyes Jr. and he called it something like &#39;Three Rules <br/>\nfor Happiness&#39;:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Ask for what you want - but don&#39;t demand it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Accept whatever happens - for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Turn up your love - even if you don&#39;t get what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does this work for me in practice?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, right now, my 11 year old son Pat won&#39;t eat fruit. In fact, <br/>\nthat&#39;s been the case for most of his childhood. I want him to eat <br/>\nfruit. That&#39;s for my benefit - then I&#39;m a &#39;good&#39; parent, right? What <br/>\na relief. Who wants to be thought of as a &#39;bad&#39; parent?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one day Pat&#39;s a bit peckish, and I ask him, &quot;Would you like <br/>\na banana?&quot; (He did eat bananas when he was a toddler)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Okay. What would you like?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Would you cook me some rice?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so we get on with our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still want Pat to eat fruit. Maybe a couple of days later, Pat&#39;s in <br/>\nthe pantry looking for something to snack on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are some bananas here if you want one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a couple of days later I&#39;m eating a banana myself and I say to <br/>\nPat, &quot;Mmmm ... I love bananas. Did you know bananas are one of the <br/>\nmost nutritional foods you can eat?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPat says, &quot;Bob, I know you&#39;re trying to trick me into eating a banana <br/>\nand it won&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we both burst out laughing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Pat will eat bananas one day, maybe he won&#39;t. I want him to. <br/>\nI&#39;m also okay with his decision either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I&#39;ve made some major changes to my own diet as a <br/>\nresult of wondering about what my son eats, while learning not to be <br/>\ntoo concerned about that. That&#39;s made me a more useful model. My son <br/>\nwon&#39;t eat vegetables either. But it&#39;s worth noting that he does drink <br/>\nmostly water, sometimes milk, and won&#39;t touch fizzy drinks (soda); he <br/>\nrarely eats candy (&#39;lollies&#39; here in Australia) and the only &#39;junk <br/>\nfood&#39; he likes is potato chips and mcnuggets. So it&#39;s not all bad. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminds me of something from my daughter&#39;s early childhood in <br/>\nrural England. Sometimes when she and I were in the village shop, <br/>\nshe&#39;d ask for some candy (&#39;sweets&#39; in England) and, me being me, I&#39;d <br/>\nsay, &quot;What would you like?&quot; So we would get home with a big bag of <br/>\nsweets and Bronnie would eat one or a few and decide to save the rest <br/>\nfor later. Usually, she&#39;d end up sharing them with her playmates, <br/>\nand, if that didn&#39;t happen, the bag of sweets would be in her room <br/>\ncompletely untouched, sometimes for weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day when she was about six or seven, my daughter had a box of <br/>\nSmarties (do you have those in America? They&#39;re like M&Ms). It had <br/>\nbeen inside an Easter egg she&#39;d previously eaten and she&#39;d had this <br/>\nbox of Smarties for days without opening it. Some of her friends came <br/>\nto play after school - four other girls - and Bronnie opened the box <br/>\nof Smarties and laid them all out in rows on the table according to <br/>\ntheir colour, as you do, maybe sixty or seventy Smarties all <br/>\ntogether, and she invited her friends to help themselves if they <br/>\nwanted some. It was like a feeding frenzy at the zoo. I&#39;m standing <br/>\nthere watching this with my eyes popping out of my head, thinking <br/>\nmaybe that wasn&#39;t such a good idea if the other girls were going home <br/>\nto have their tea, but too late, so I suggested to Bronnie she might <br/>\nlike to grab a few Smarties herself before they all go. I could see <br/>\nfrom the look on her face that she was thinking something <br/>\nlike, &quot;Hmmm ... that was unexpected.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, when I was a boy, my parents were poor (my wife and I aren&#39;t) <br/>\nand sweets were a luxury. It&#39;s more difficult for some parents than <br/>\nit is for others to be supportive of what their children want. If <br/>\nthey choose to be. That wasn&#39;t the case with my parents. I got a <br/>\nsmall bag of sweets once a week, on a Saturday, that was supposed to <br/>\nlast me until the next Saturday - but it *was* contingent upon <br/>\nme &#39;being good&#39;. That&#39;s a different consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is that I hardly ever eat candy myself these days, but, <br/>\nonly last week, I bought a big bag of marshmallows and ate every one <br/>\nof them myself in about ten minutes. And felt sick afterwards. That <br/>\nwas totally triggered by childhood memories and nothing to do with <br/>\nfood. I wasn&#39;t even hungry, never mind hungry for candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood as a substitute for other things - a deep and complex subject. <br/>\nEvery body is different. And we really don&#39;t know what&#39;s for our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s good. All the more reason for us to trust our children to <br/>\ntrust what their own bodies tell them so that food is all about what <br/>\nour body actually needs and not what our mind thinks it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, John Rizzo &lt;jmcrizzo@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My wife and I are embarking on unschooling with dd who is 3.5 and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ds who is 1.

Since portability, availability of small portions, and <br/>\nattractive presentation are all things my dd finds appealing, I try <br/>\nto add those elements to more nutritious foods, especially if she&#39;s <br/>\nnot eating a whole lot. One way I do that if Mo&#39;s really focussed on <br/>\na project and forgetting to eat, is to put together a mixed plate <br/>\nwith tiny portions of different foods - maybe just all on the plate, <br/>\nmaybe in little bowls or cups - and bringing it right to her so that <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t have to stop what she&#39;s doing to eat. I include things <br/>\nlike cookies and chips in with other offerrings, and often she&#39;ll <br/>\neat some of everything, or ignore the &quot;treats&quot; altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother method I use, if she&#39;s prefrerring to get her own food, is <br/>\nto make individual servings of home-made or bulk foods in baggies or <br/>\nwraps or bowls, and decant milk and juice into smaller containers <br/>\nthat are easier for her to pour. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find that sort of attention to detail helps Mo make decisions <br/>\nabout food based more on what her body needs. My stepson, too, for <br/>\nthat matter. He&#39;s perfectly happy to heat up nutritous leftovers <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s up late at night, but doesn&#39;t have a lot of confidence <br/>\nwhen it comes to cooking from scratch, so he prefers to make <br/>\nconvenience foods. Keeping the fridge stocked with foods that are <br/>\neasy *and* nutritious lets him make a decision based on something <br/>\nother than convenience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, sometimes someone in the family wants to eat a <br/>\nlot of cookies, or boxed mac&#39;n&#39;cheese for a couple days, or <br/>\nwhatever. I really believe that bc we&#39;ve chosen not to create a <br/>\npower struggle over those sorts of things its much easier for Mo and <br/>\nRay to experiment with that kind of eating, learn what they want to <br/>\nlearn from it, and move on. Its noticabley harder for me or my <br/>\npartner to move on when its one of us who wants to eat cookies all <br/>\nday (guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt). <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212998679,"authorName":"Elizabeth Fritcher","from":"Elizabeth Fritcher &lt;ekf@...&gt;","profile":"melissafritcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Freedom of Choice and Nutrition","postDate":"1178896128","msgId":28731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2NDQ4NzAwLjgwNTA3QHdvbGZuZXQub3JnPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVDQTU4N0M4Q0Y0NDRGQkJBQ0VFNDlCNzE1NTRERTJCQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDQ1ODU1OS43NDI2NC5xbUB3ZWI4MTExMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw1Q0E1ODdDOENGNDQ0RkJCQUNFRTQ5QjcxNTU0REUyQkBSb2J5blBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":28729,"nextInTopic":28737,"prevInTime":28730,"nextInTime":28732,"topicId":28724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********* I missed the original post, sorry.
