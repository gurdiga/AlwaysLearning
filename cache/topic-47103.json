Don&#39;t make nail<br/>\n&gt; biting a disease.  It&#39;s a habit, a grooming habit if you will.  There<br/>\n&gt; are other ways to keep nails trimmed, but nail biting is one way in<br/>\n&gt; which it&#39;s done.  I was a nail biter and thumb sucker as a child.  It<br/>\n&gt; was physically uncomfortable to have any white parts of nail growing out<br/>\n&gt; beyond where the nail was stuck down onto the skin.  I really couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; handle that sensation and clippers and nail scissors wouldn&#39;t get that<br/>\n&gt; close, the way I needed it to be.  By the time I was about 14, I decided<br/>\n&gt; on my own to stop biting my nails and let them grow.  I dealt with the<br/>\n&gt; physical discomfort because it was my choice to do so, I pushed past it<br/>\n&gt; and found a way to let my nails grow.  I keep my nails trimmed.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like them long, but I&#39;m also happy that I don&#39;t get hang nails anymore<br/>\n&gt; like I did when I bit my nails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for that. I will be more aware of the way that I think about her nail biting- as a habit and not a disease. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a new habit. My forever-straight hair has just started to get a few waves and, dare I might say, a little curl. I LOVE to twirl it right at the spot where it is started to curl to get it a bit curlier. It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s relaxing and it makes me feel good because I like this new physical sensation of having hair with body! Now I see how my daughter might feel about her nail biting. It feels good (most of the time, anyway), fulfills a need, and I could go so far as to say it&#39;s fun for her. That helps me be more compassionate and understanding when she needs another bandaid or when I offer to help her wash her hands. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to this list for letting me think all of this &quot;outloud&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180190530,"authorName":"casa_divina","from":"&quot;casa_divina&quot; &lt;casa_divina@...&gt;","profile":"casa_divina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Nail biting","postDate":"1251669877","msgId":47137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3ZXQxbCszaHBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEIwRUU1QjZDLThFNTQtNDk2Ni1CQzg3LUJGOUY5RTk5MTVDNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47136,"nextInTopic":47138,"prevInTime":47136,"nextInTime":47138,"topicId":47103,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At first, when she started, I thought it was a phase that would pass- like her older sister went through. Now though, it seems to be getting more frequent and I&#39;m wondering what other unschooling families experiences have been with this habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always associated nail-biting as a nervous habit. Not sure where that comes from. But it makes me think of close friends I had in grammar school and high school that wished they could stop, but couldn&#39;t. They weren&#39;t even aware that they were doing it, and did not like the physical appearance of their bitten down nails. My best friend today of 17 years has that nail-bitten look and I have NEVER seen her bite her nails. She says she doesn&#39;t even know when she does it, let alone can she figure out how to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my 6 year old daughter starting biting her nails a few years ago, yep about the same age as my youngest who nail bites now, I was concerned that maybe I was missing something. I spoke with a very helpful counselor over the phone who suggested I try sleep-talking; talking to her while she&#39;s asleep to let her know that I am here for her if she has something stressful going on in her life that I don&#39;t know about. I did sleep-talk with her a few times and, low and behold, she stopped. Just like night and day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, with my youngest daughter starting up with nail biting, I question my motives. I think the sleep-talking thing might work, but that would be me assuming that she is biting her nails due to some unknown stress. And honestly, in the wee hours of the night when I should be doing it, I forget. I only remember her nail biting when I see it throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am concerned for my daughter now, not so much because I think it is a bad habit (although I admit it is hard to shake that association), but because she is starting to hurt herself and often makes herself uncomfortable because she cannot seem to stop. A few months ago she used to also bite her toenails. I was concerned about that because we live rurally and keep chickens and other animals and sometimes the girls go outside barefoot, even though I ask them not to, explain the risks and always have a variety of shoes for them to wear, from flip flops to rubber boots. So the thought of her sticking her toe in her mouth at any moment really worried me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot too long after she started she got a really bad infected in-grown toe nail. It was painful, woke her up at night, we had to drain it because the pressure was so bad. It took a long time to heal but she got over it. We talked about how clipping those annoying hang nails and snagged ends is a safer way to go then biting them off. She was cured of biting her toe nails after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe continues to bite her finger nails. She often makes herself bleed and wants a bandaid because it hurts when she has bitten too far down the nail or has torn of a hang nail. I keep bandaids around the house and have bought more nail clippers to have handy when she finds an annoying nail. I have noticed that she will ask me every once in a while to clip an annoying nail, but most of the time she prefers to take care of it herself by biting it. I also offer to clip when I see her biting, sometimes she accepts sometimes she declines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when it is inconvenient as well. We will be transitioning from one thing to another (like hopping out of a taxi - we don&#39;t own a car and this happens alot!) and she will insist that we wait until she&#39;s finished biting her nail. We settle down to read sometimes at night, or watch a movie and I can&#39;t help but be aware of the almost manic way she attacks those nails during our quiet, mellow time. Honestly, it stresses me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been unschooling for a year now and I am interested in learning how I can better support my daughter during this time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13346,"nextTopicId":47086}}
