When we were getting ready<br/>\nfor dinner or going out I was constantly saying to Zak &quot;turn that thing off<br/>\nplease&quot; and he&#39;d say &quot;I&#39;m in a battle it will take a few minutes&quot;  Before I<br/>\nreally looked at the game I would turn it off and he started crying and<br/>\ncomplaining that he would lose his battle and have to start again to get to<br/>\nthat level.  That made sense to me and so now I give him a 15 minute warning<br/>\nthat he needs to save his game because we are having dinner or whatever we<br/>\nare moving onto that doesn&#39;t include him having the gameboy attached to him<br/>\nas an appendage.  One other thing for Zak is that I notice if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ngive up his gameboy at least a couple of hours prior to bed he can&#39;t sleep,<br/>\nall he can think about is his game and what&#39;s next..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIts amazing how you see the world once you put respecting kids on a <br/>\nhigher level than maintaining &quot;control&quot; as a parent...in the same <br/>\nday i read an article in some magazine about limiting videogames, <br/>\nwhich including maintaining a &quot;half hour&quot; rule on school days and <br/>\nonly an hour of playing on weekend days. I thought &quot;How the heck can <br/>\nthe kid get anything done in a game in an hour?!&quot; Then we were <br/>\nwatching this new show on tv called &quot;6 Degrees&quot;, and the dad told <br/>\nthe son to stop playing his game, it was bedtime. The kid said &quot;A <br/>\ncouple more minutes, I&#39;m almost done with this level!!&quot; The dad made <br/>\nhim turn it off immediately, and then when the kid complained he <br/>\nsmashed the gameboy. My first thought was &quot;Doesnt this parent know <br/>\nthat there are only certain &quot;save spots&quot; in the game, and the child <br/>\nwill lose all his hard work if he stops now!?!&quot; Its so much better <br/>\nto be on your child&#39;s side.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn M.
