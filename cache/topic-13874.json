My problem though is the guy upstairs. He&#39;s been supportive of Coyotes Corner (our home business); however, I strongly suspect he has Aspergers Syndrome - for those that are unfamiliar - Aspergers folks are very high functioning in certain areas, w/ little or no social skills.<br/>\nThat translates into poor choices on his part  - trust me - we have many examples!! For example - he&#39;ll knock on the door forever - one night Brianna & I were lying down in the far bedroom reading. He saw the van - he knocked for over 20 minutes, while calling on the home phone and the cell phone - and calling our dog &quot;Come on Teah, come here girl&quot; - so Teah started barking, etc. <br/>\nBrianna finally answered. <br/>\nHe said he wanted to make sure we were ok.<br/>\nI fear that if I left her alone and he heard her and Teah, he would be knocking and calling - perhaps calling the authorities - to make sure she&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve pointed out that no one is obligated to answer a phone or a door.<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact of the matter is, I have no one to leave Brianna with, so I end up taking her or not going.<br/>\nI guess that&#39;s okay - heck, soon enough, she&#39;ll outgrow this stage and I&#39;ll miss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kerrin or Ralph Taylor <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 9:20 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Leaving kids home alone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that like all the other stages our kids go through, readiness to be left alone isn&#39;t necessarily age related.
