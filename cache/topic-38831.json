It&#39;s structural engineering.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s 3D modeling. It&#39;s fractions. (How many smaller bricks can fit in  <br/>\nwhen you don&#39;t have any of the bigger bricks left?) (Others will have  <br/>\nsome more ideas, I&#39;m sure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I shouldn&#39;t say trick. Real learning is messy. It bears no  <br/>\nresemblance to school learning. If you pay attention to how your  <br/>\nyoungest are learning language it looks nothing like Spanish class!  <br/>\nAnd yet it works beautifully and painlessly. The same can&#39;t be said  <br/>\nabout Spanish class ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by breaking real learning down into schoolish looking learning, it  <br/>\ndoes a disservice to real learning. Dumbing it down so to speak! It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot a goal of unschooling to see how unschooling matches school. But  <br/>\nseeing how kids are learning what they might in school by playing  <br/>\n*can* be a way to soothe fears so a parent can absorb what&#39;s even  <br/>\nbetter about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it can help spouses. Spouses are often cut off from so much of  <br/>\nwhat goes on, they only get glimpses of the surface. He&#39;s worried   <br/>\nbecause he cares.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that seems to have helped a lot of dads is getting them to  <br/>\nan unschooling conference so they can see older unschooled kids who  <br/>\naren&#39;t slack jawed droolers useful only for the loading docks at Wal- <br/>\nMart ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a list at the Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listByType?type=conference\">http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listByType?type=conference</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listByType?type=Conference\">http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listByType?type=Conference</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(Unfortunately the tags are case sensitive so the lists are on two  <br/>\nseparate pages.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334153590,"authorName":"dakotastormsand","from":"&quot;dakotastormsand&quot; &lt;hsand06@...&gt;","profile":"dakotastormsand","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Hi!
