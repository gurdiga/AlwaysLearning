From successful parents, learn how to train up your  <br/>\nchildren rather than discipline them up. With humor and real-life  <br/>\nexamples this book shows you how to train your children before the  <br/>\nneed to discipline arises. Be done with corrective discipline; make  <br/>\nthem allies rather than adversaries. The stress will be gone and your  <br/>\nobedient children will praise you and bring joy and peace into your  <br/>\nhome. Thousands have testified to the amazing results of these  <br/>\nprofoundly simple techniques.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phrase &quot;make them allied rather than adversaries&quot; is from  <br/>\nattachment parenting and La Leche League, neither of which is  <br/>\nrecommending spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage like that as a cover for spanking is kind of despicable, but  <br/>\nit reminds me to remind you not to assume that all people are using  <br/>\nall phrases and words with the same intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31019,"nextTopicId":31023}}
