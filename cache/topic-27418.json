However, due to a rather sad job market (or so we&#39;ve <br/>\nfound in the town we live in anyway) we have decided we are likely <br/>\ngoing to move back to Omaha next Spring/Summer. (as soon as we can sell <br/>\nour house/land and get all the particulars worked out etc) As I&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscussed on the group before, I plan to homeschool/unschool my kids <br/>\n(they are only 3 1/3 and nearly 2 just now so I&#39;ve got a bit of time <br/>\nbefore I have to worry about the &#39;laws&#39; but...). Does anyone know <br/>\nthe &#39;laws&#39; and whatnot in Nebraska regarding Homeschooling? I tried to <br/>\nfind something about it on the internet and found a law about how if <br/>\nyou homeschool you need to &#39;establish a private school&#39; to <br/>\nhomeschool... Does anyone have experience with this and how it is done. <br/>\nIt also appears there are attendance requirements and I assume those <br/>\ncan be met by just keeping a &#39;record&#39; of attendance in a book (easy <br/>\nenough)... Any ideas or experience would be appriciated. Thanks!<br/>\nSmiles,<br/>\n Heather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27403,"nextTopicId":27421}}
