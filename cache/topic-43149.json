I think it could use a page all its own if it doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>\nMy copy is on my fridge held by a magnet.  Here are the contents:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1. Show respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>\n  2. Keep the child in mind as I go through life, so that I notice<br/>\n     things that might be of interest to that child.<br/>\n  3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a<br/>\n     more&quot;open-book&#39; life than the norm.<br/>\n  4. Follow up on things the child is interested in - and do this in a<br/>\n     wide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting him a book on it.&quot;<br/>\n  5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a variety of<br/>\n     kinds both at *home* and outside the *home*.<br/>\n  6. Have resources around the *home* that are interesting and<br/>\n     stimulating - things that will encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>\n  7. Discuss things - spend time in conversation. This is probably<br/>\n     overall the most important parental&quot;action&#39; involved in *unschooling*.<br/>\n  8. Have a&quot;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have fun, appreciate the<br/>\n     amazing world around you. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to be amazed<br/>\n     and find the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most<br/>\n     important&quot;attitude&#39; for an *unschooling* parent.<br/>\n  9. Be self-aware of your own thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch<br/>\n     your imagination - question your own assumptions, check your own<br/>\n     automatic impulses.<br/>\n 10. Be very observant of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view<br/>\n     him/her in a shallow superficial way. Recognize that there is a<br/>\n     reason for a child&#39;s actions, that a child is&quot;born to learn&#39; and<br/>\n     is always learning. Get to know your child&#39;s own special favored<br/>\n     ways of learning<br/>\n 11. Wholeheartedly support a child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they<br/>\n     don&#39;t look like &quot;education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a link about unschooling principles also by Pam is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Keep your family together!

I  <br/>\nhadn&#39;t thought of it that way, but when he told it, the whole picture  <br/>\ncame flooding back, of why he started hanging out at Active  <br/>\nImagination in the first place (the gaming shop in which he worked  <br/>\nfrom 14 to 19).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs","postDate":"1237292633","msgId":43212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDkwMzE3MDUyM2g2MmUwYTZiZmoxNTE0ZjIyODdlNGUwZDlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA2NzMwMWM5YTY3MCRiMmFmZTY3MCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4=","referencesHeader":"PGdwamg1OCs5dnVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDgwNzYyRkZBLTJBNDUtNDZGOC1BNUYzLTRGREYxQTVDNDEzMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxDOTRFQzY3OS1EQjY5LTQxRDMtODMzMy1CMjlGNkM4RTM4MDRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CSA8MDY3MzAxYzlhNjcwJGIyYWZlNjcwJDY0MGFhOWE5QEdvbnpvPg=="},"prevInTopic":43208,"nextInTopic":43215,"prevInTime":43211,"nextInTime":43213,"topicId":43149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I usually don t take the time to click a lot of links.

It has also been suggested that ecological crises are an<br/>\ninstance of risk homeostasis in which behavior known to be dangerous<br/>\ncontinues until dramatic consequences actually occur. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nThat says a lot about human nature, which in my opinion is what unschooling<br/>\nis based on in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling can be like driving without anti-lock brakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople (children and adults) do things that on the surface look dangerous,<br/>\nthings that could actually result in catastrophe.  This behavior has nothing<br/>\nto do with unschooling or not unschooling.  It&#39;s how humans naturally are.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that allowing children to make some decisions and take some<br/>\nrisks is more dangerous than protecting our children from any and all<br/>\nexposure to risk?  Using the example above of relying on ABS (anti-lock<br/>\nbrakes) or driving without them, I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who haven&#39;t very often experienced the results of their own mistakes<br/>\n(or learning takes as Kelly Lovejoy calls them), who have led more sheltered<br/>\nlives, might sometimes be more likely (or frequently as the case may be) to<br/>\nignore any safety precautions they&#39;ve been told all their lives once they<br/>\nget out on their own.  Perhaps for years.  Because maybe they feel pretty<br/>\nsecure with their &quot;ABS.&quot;  That goes for driving, eating, interacting within<br/>\nall types of relationships (with partners, children, friends, etc), and any<br/>\nother risk behavior.  Living is itself a risk behavior...  of which the<br/>\nconsequence is ultimately death.

In my opinion, they&#39;re based on how human nature works.  It&#39;s<br/>\neasy to get away from them after a while and assume that I know them better<br/>\nthan I actually do.  And I like Pam&#39;s wonderful write up on &quot;What Do<br/>\nUnschoolers Do&quot; for keeping on track since doing is where I tend to fall<br/>\nbehind.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Maybe you could give me some suggestions about HOW to give someone<br/>\npersuasive evidence....please?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is a great question, and has to do with the way individuals<br/>\n </span></blockquote>communicate.  I hope others will have good ideas, and I&#39;ll try to<br/>\ncollect them up and save them.   Something to consider, though, is to<br/>\nidentify the ways in which one is NOT being persuasive, or is being<br/>\nirritating, and then not do those things. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPersuasion is meant to operate on information that one&#39;s audience is<br/>\nsomewhat interested in.  A mistake that&#39;s easy to make is to see one&#39;s own<br/>\npoints as more important than what the audience would want to know.  But<br/>\nboth are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help some to consider persuasion from a traditional approach of<br/>\nrhetoric.  Enough to understand how people argue points and what&#39;s effective<br/>\nor not effective about different kinds of presentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance.  Some people are not easily swayed by emotional appeal.<br/>\nOthers don&#39;t trust anything else.  Some people would rather get a logical<br/>\nchain of evidence.  Some people would rather eschew both of those approaches<br/>\nin favor of a presentation based on tradition.  I think Tolkien is an<br/>\nexcellent example of the traditional approach with all those hobbits, their<br/>\nfood, their ale, their gardens, their communal life and so forth.  Other<br/>\nideas of tradition are linked with favored icons, religious, political,<br/>\ncommercial and otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little disclaimer: I think most people prefer a blend of different<br/>\npresentations.  Which is why a little humor (or a lot, depending on one&#39;s<br/>\naudience) lightens the weightier stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to know that a person who loves comfort and is somewhat<br/>\ntraditional may find logical or emotional appeals off putting or unnecessary<br/>\nor silly or whatever.  It&#39;s not a good strategy to continually present logic<br/>\nto someone who prefers a different type of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe information might be vital no matter how it&#39;s presented yet that same<br/>\ninformation makes a bigger impact after observing and studying how best to<br/>\nmake one&#39;s case.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, being the only parent who supports unschooling can sometimes be a<br/>\nbit like studying for the bar or getting into political science.  Or it can<br/>\nbe thought of as simply noting what the people in your life who don&#39;t<br/>\nsupport unschooling prefer and giving more in that vein so as to keep the<br/>\ncredit flowing and continue unschooling long enough for your family and your<br/>\nchildren to prove it without having to say so much about it.  Like Verna<br/>\nsays in a previous post in this thread.  :)  Sometimes quietly going about<br/>\nthe business of unschooling is by far the best appeal one can make.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Keep your family together!

Ten<br/>\n&gt; points that educators should address are listed:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    1. We should teach people to be *authentic,* to be aware of their inner<br/>\n&gt;    selves and to hear their inner-feeling voices.<br/>\n&gt;    2. We should teach people to *transcend their cultural conditioning *and become world citizens.<br/>\n&gt;    3. We should help people *discover their vocation in life,* their<br/>\n&gt;    calling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right<br/>\n&gt;    career and the right mate.<br/>\n&gt;    4. We should teach people that *life is precious,* that there is joy to<br/>\n&gt;    be experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous<br/>\n&gt;    in all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living.<br/>\n&gt;    5. We must *accept the person* as he or she is and help the person<br/>\n&gt;    learn their inner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations<br/>\n&gt;    we can know what to build upon, what potentials are really there.<br/>\n&gt;    6. We must see that the person&#39;s *basic needs are satisfied.* This<br/>\n&gt;    includes safety, belongingness, and esteem needs.<br/>\n&gt;    7. We should *refreshen consciousness,* teaching the person to<br/>\n&gt;    appreciate beauty and the other good things in nature and in living.<br/>\n&gt;    8. We should teach people that *controls are good,* and complete<br/>\n&gt;    abandon is bad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all<br/>\n&gt;    areas.<br/>\n&gt;    9. We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and *grapple<br/>\n&gt;    with the serious problems in life.* These include the problems of<br/>\n&gt;    injustice, of pain, suffering, and death.<br/>\n&gt;    10. We must teach people to be *good choosers.* They must be given<br/>\n&gt;    practice in making good choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As an unschooler, I&#39;d revise it to say:<br/>\n1. We allow people to be *authentic*, encourage an awareness of inner self<br/>\nand an ear for their inner-feeling voices.<br/>\n2. We model *transencion of cultural conditioning* and live as a world<br/>\ncitizen.<br/>\n3. We support people on their very own *journey of discovery that leads to<br/>\ntheir vocation, calling, fate, destiny, future*. This is especially focused<br/>\non finding a joyous path through life as a whole; including in vocation and<br/>\nin relationships.<br/>\n4. We live as though *life is precious, that there is joy to be experienced<br/>\nin life,* and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous in all kinds<br/>\nof situations, life is worth living joyfully in the present.<br/>\n5. *We accept the person s/he is and work to understand the person&#39;s inner<br/>\nnature. From real knowlege of *who someone is* comes the understanding of<br/>\nwhat to build upon and what potential is really there.*<br/>\n6. We see that a person&#39;s *basic needs are satisfied*. This includes safety,<br/>\na sense of belonging, and esteem needs.<br/>\n7. We *live consciously*, modeling an appreciation for beauty and good<br/>\nthings in life, near and far.<br/>\n8. We understand that arbitrary controls are not a one-size-fits-all<br/>\nsolution to conflict in life. Principles are important and far more<br/>\napplicable to real life situations.  From a life led by principles, one<br/>\nunderstands intrinsic limitations and can easily follow them.<br/>\n9. We model goals to transcend trifling daily problems; we grapple with the<br/>\nserious problems in life as they naturally occur in our world. Injustice,<br/>\npain, suffering and death are discussed, examined and dealt with in an open,<br/>\nhonest environment with information at the appropriate level for the less<br/>\nexperienced people in the equation.<br/>\n10. We understand that making good choices is a result of the practice of<br/>\nmaking choices.  We allow people to make choices with available information,<br/>\nsupport and freedom, without our judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\na few are still sticky, like 8 & 10.

I forget to eat and drink. Hours after I should<br/>\nhave eaten, I will be shaky and short tempered and wanting to eat NOW so<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m busy, I&#39;ll just grab whatever is quick (not always the best choice)<br/>\nand go back to work. I don&#39;t have time to fix a meal and wait for it to be<br/>\ndone! Nor do I have the energy or patience to stand there and do it. It is a<br/>\nrare occasion that I have dinner ready for my husband when he gets home from<br/>\nwork. He often brings take-out food or lately we&#39;ve been cooking together<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s been coming home earlier. I am amazed that I&#39;ve been able to<br/>\nfeed my son, but he is a high priority for me. Often I will feed him and not<br/>\neat myself. I also keep lots of snacks on low shelves in the cabinets and he<br/>\nhelps himself when he gets hungry. A few times a week I&#39;ll make a Monkey<br/>\nPlatter and we&#39;ll both munch on that while we watch a movie or play games.<br/>\nSnacking does me good, especially when I have good things to choose from. I<br/>\njust need to remember to do it (and shop ahead for it!).<br/>\n <br/>\nI go through phases of not sleeping much or having disturbed sleep. During a<br/>\nbig project or something, I can get by on 3 hrs of sleep but only for a<br/>\nweek, then I need to hybernate like a bear. I get headaches from not<br/>\ndrinking enough or breathing well. (I know this because I can sometimes help<br/>\nthem go away by breathing deeply, completely filling the lungs over and over<br/>\nfor a minute or two so more oxygen gets to the brain, or by drinking more<br/>\nwater.) I am more concerned with creativity, spontaneity,<br/>\nself-actualization, working on ways to achieve those things more. Right now<br/>\ndoing a lot of reading about unschooling and trying to incorporate the<br/>\nbasics into my whole life and live by example. I&#39;m in a mental phase.<br/>\nAnyway, I also tend to forget to pay bills. Quite often. We&#39;ve had several<br/>\n2nd and final notices before I get around to paying. We have the money, I<br/>\njust don&#39;t do it. Recently I admitted this to my cousin and she does the<br/>\nSAME thing! What does this mean about us?!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you want a little more on Maslow, this page has something nice at the<br/>\nbottom:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/ma\">http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/ma</a><br/>\nslow.htm<br/>\n <br/>\nInteresting quote from above link: Maslow believes that the only reason that<br/>\npeople would not move well in direction of self-actualization is because of<br/>\nhindrances placed in their way by society. He states that education is one<br/>\nof these hindrances. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen they list 10 points educators can address, which seem kind of like the<br/>\ntennants of unschooling, but are also quite relavent to everyone! I&#39;ll just<br/>\ncopy them here for those who don&#39;t get around to clicking on the link.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tWe should teach people to be authentic, to be aware of their inner<br/>\nselves and to hear their inner-feeling voices. <br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tWe should teach people to transcend their cultural conditioning and<br/>\nbecome world citizens. <br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tWe should help people discover their vocation in life, their<br/>\ncalling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right<br/>\ncareer and the right mate. <br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tWe should teach people that life is precious, that there is joy to<br/>\nbe experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous<br/>\nin all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living. <br/>\n<br/>\n5.\tWe must accept the person as he or she is and help the person learn<br/>\ntheir inner nature.

If one wants to unschool and the other doesn&#39;t than the unschooling ready parent needs to relax and not make a big issue out of it. You can be a supportive and loving and nurturing parent without being an unschooler. You can home-educate without being an unschooler. Your kids can be in school and still have an engaged and supportive family life.

That&#39;s the commitment that I figure counts first. If one wants to unschool and the other doesn&#39;t than the unschooling ready parent needs to relax and not make a big issue out of it. You can be a supportive and loving and nurturing parent without being an unschooler. You can home-educate without being an unschooler. Your kids can be in school and still have an engaged and supportive family life.

The damage didn&#39;t seem much to us but the insurance company said it was a total loss and paid us a small amount - it was a 2000 model but we took excellent care of it and it only had 78000 miles on it.  We thought it would last us another 10 years.  I really resisted another large monthly payment as I enjoyed the freedom of having no vehicle payment ;)  I finally realized that I was keeping us in turmoil over what we could clearly afford because I was resisting change.  Anyway - we both had to sign on a loan - it took both of us in agreement on what we wanted to harmoniously walk forward together.  If I had begrudgingly given in I would have resented that monthly payment (vehicle) every time I paid the bill or every time I wanted to do something but could not afford it due to thinking it was Ed&#39;s fault because he insisted on the new vehicle.  I even told Ed I just needed time and space to adjust and to please be patient with me - he gave me that time and space - trusting that I&#39;d let him know when I was ready to move forward.   When I was ready I let him know I was OK with it and we could sign the papers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also in the middle of repairing the rot on our house - yea when it rains it pours - meaning new siding and 9 new windows.  The house is only 15 years old but I won&#39;t go into that ;)  just saying that too had to be a joint decision.  At first we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have to replace windows - then Ed called me at work Tuesday and suggested I come straight home after work so he could show me the rotted windows and that we&#39;d have to pick out windows.  I would not have been happy if he had picked out windows without me.  It needed to be a joint decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definately would be an unhappy person (wife) if I drove up one day and there sat a new vehicle and basically a new house!  Not that he could do it without my siganture on the loan papers but if he could, there would be resentment and always that feeling of mistrust.

It&#39;s generally the cause of her unhappiness. <br/>\nHowever, over the years, she&#39;s started to own her own happiness,<br/>\nacknowledging that things can get her down, but she doesn&#39;t have to stay<br/>\nthere.  I attribute that directly to unschooling and the focus on happy<br/>\nrespect and personal discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I feel that it is part of my duty as a parent to promote and<br/>\ncreate happiness, then naturally that will be a large part of our life! <br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how many parents don&#39;t see that as being a major goal<br/>\nin parenting, it&#39;s a lot, and it&#39;s apparent when you get to know some of<br/>\nthe kids of those parents, and it creates a need for sites for teens<br/>\nthat give pep talks.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille and I were talking about teen angst the other day.  A certain<br/>\nsong brought it up.  She said she liked the song but chose not to listen<br/>\nto it anymore because it didn&#39;t create happy thinking and reminded her<br/>\nof a time in her life when she was pretty unhappy.  We talked a lot<br/>\nabout that, about how a lot of kids experience that at some point in<br/>\ntheir teen lives, and that many of them never leave that place of<br/>\ndiscontent.  It was cool to see that she recognized that it was<br/>\nsomething that she experienced but found a way to move beyond it.  It<br/>\ndeeply bothers her that so many kids her age simply aren&#39;t happy.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Keep your family together!
