AND once released to the group it is free to flow into any numerous directions - it ceases to be about your specific situation, people are not necessarily discussing your particular situation and what you SHOULD do but how they might approach it from their unschooling perspective.  They are not judging you as wrong in any way.  They are simply challenging you to see it from a different perspective - to try on new thoughts - to stretch and grow - to consider the possibilities of what is you looked at it from this perspective (to possibly change or not) or to at least know why you are doing what you are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are told up front that this in not the place to come to get your back patted (to have what you already do validated) but to challenge yourself.  I am surprised when people post things contrary to the information given when joining and then are upset when they are given a response I pretty much knew was coming based upon the information given when joining.  Or they immediately argue with every suggestion as to why that cannot be done/even considered or tried.  Or why would one try to tell the list owner how to run things - or put her back in her place - when if you read for awhile as asked to do  - you know where Sandra&#39;s place is and she is firmly there ;)  ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group IS about challenging my thought processes about unschooling and raising our child - that is the purpose of the group IMO.  That is why I joined - to be challenged in my thinking and to go to the next level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too have found in the past (not necessarily only on this group as I&#39;ve only been a member for about a month but in life) that when something annoys, aggravates or pushes my buttons - it is usually about my way being challenged and I often have to reevaluate and rethink things - sometimes I change my mind and sometimes I do not. But at least I&#39;ve made a decision based on more information not just because (meaning having no idea why really).  Sometimes I discard a new thought as no way!  Then revisit it later when I&#39;m not so in the moment.  I don&#39;t always change in an instant but gradually over time.  Something I said no way to a year or two ago is now just my way.
