I have a question for Sandra. I saw a blurb on<br/>\nyour site about how you disagree with the idea that unschooling<br/>\nstarts at birth, but I&#39;ve been scratching my head over it ever<br/>\nsince. Have you written about it someplace? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ve only written about it in discussions like these, and not  <br/>\nfor a long time because I feel like one of the very few who make the  <br/>\ndistinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many facets of my objection to people with pre-verbal, non- <br/>\nwalking babies saying &quot;We&#39;re homeschooling,&quot; but the main one is that  <br/>\nif a baby is in a stage that the state wouldn&#39;t require him to be in  <br/>\nschool, the parents are not yet at a point that they know with  <br/>\ncertainty that they will not put him in school when he&#39;s five or six.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have enough problems on the lists with families who really,  <br/>\nunquestionably, registered-with-the-state (or whatever) are  <br/>\nhomeschooling, and trying to help them get settled in and calm  <br/>\nwithout spending lots of time on the very speculative mothers of  <br/>\nbabies and toddlers who sometimes (perhaps starved for adult contact,  <br/>\na state I remember) will rattle ON and on and they sometimes have no  <br/>\nexperience to add to the conversations and the things we&#39;re talking  <br/>\nabout don&#39;t apply to them, because they have tiny children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had three babies.   We were big into attachment parenting.  I  <br/>\nthink it&#39;s fantastic if people ask for attachment parenting advice  <br/>\nbecause they intend to unschool when the kids are older, but I don&#39;t  <br/>\nsee any advantage or logic of calling it &quot;unschooling&quot; when school  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t even an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best counter-argument is a regional one.  In Delaware and  <br/>\nMaryland and thereabout, lots of people seem to be putting babies in  <br/>\nschool at two or three, so it&#39;s important for those families to  <br/>\ndeclare a fancy reason why they&#39;re NOT putting their kids in  <br/>\nadvanced, accelerated, college-preparatory nursery school.   That&#39;s  <br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve heard from people over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been families where much noise was made, much drama  <br/>\nunfolded,  much consideration made, and they said they were  <br/>\nunschoolers (without any benefit to other unschoolers by that claim)  <br/>\nand then they bought a curriculum or put a kid in school, so in my  <br/>\nmind, it negates any claim or consideration of unschooling.  They  <br/>\nnever unschooled a school-aged child.  They schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis part&#39;s more personal to me, and my preference for people to be  <br/>\nscrupulously honest and open.  I count my unschooling from the day  <br/>\nKirby did not go to kindergarten when he was five, in a state in  <br/>\nwhich that&#39;s expected/required.   We could&#39;ve made him an exception,  <br/>\nso the first year could&#39;ve been a freebie.   We could&#39;ve put him in  <br/>\neither first or kindergarten the next year, had we not been happy  <br/>\nwith the unschooling plan.   The district would&#39;ve been okay taking  <br/>\nhim as a six year old kindergartener if we told them we hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nthought he was ready the year before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of attachment parenting and food choices and sleep-when- <br/>\nsleepy and that, I&#39;ve done since Kirby was a a baby. It wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nunschooling, because we figured he would go to school when he got  <br/>\nolder.  It was parenting a young child.   It&#39;s February and Kirby&#39;s  <br/>\n21, so I will say I&#39;ve been unschooling for 17 years.   17.5 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like it when someone comes to an unschooling discussion who&#39;s  <br/>\nnever heard of it before and starts to backdate their unschooling to  <br/>\nbirth.  I don&#39;t like it when someone who started unschooling after I  <br/>\ndid redefines her life in some fantasy autobiographical way and with  <br/>\nno change other than a statement, says she&#39;s been unschooling since  <br/>\nher kids were born.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s me.  It bugs me in the SCA when people claim to have been in for  <br/>\nfive  years just because they visited with a friend once.  I visited  <br/>\nwith friends, went to a meeting, but clearly did NOT join.  I&#39;d been  <br/>\nto the organizational  meeting of the local group, and while that&#39;s  <br/>\ninteresting, I joined four years later and was surrounded already by  <br/>\npeople making claims to have been in longer than they had just  <br/>\nbecause they knew about it, or stopped by a practice once where  <br/>\npeople weren&#39;t even in costume.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a profound, wonderful argument.  It has to do with integrity  <br/>\nand practicality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105602864,"authorName":"Wendy S.","from":"&quot;Wendy S.&quot; &lt;winksst@...&gt;","profile":"winksst","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro/Questions","postDate":"1203802437","msgId":32270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxRjQxM0NFLUU0NTYtNEM1MS04QTQxLTYzNDAxMzlEMTk3MUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDhGRTYyMjc3RDRGQjNBM0ExMkQzODM1MDgxOUZFQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGZwcG9rcCtqaTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA0OEZFNjIyNzdENEZCM0EzQTEyRDM4MzUwODE5RkVAUm9ieW5QQz4="},"prevInTopic":32267,"nextInTopic":32278,"prevInTime":32269,"nextInTime":32271,"topicId":32240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I also carefully <br/>\navoid times when Fabian is overtired, hungry, upset or angry about <br/>\nwork, distracted and likely to be annoyed by chit-chat, or right <br/>\nafter I&#39;ve done something incredibly brick-headed, when he&#39;s more <br/>\nlikely to think I probably shouldn&#39;t be trusted with a pet, let <br/>\nalone with children. <br/>\n<br/>\nSay &quot;Yes!&quot; to your husband.  You may be doing this already, but I <br/>\nknow there were areas where I wasn&#39;t and I had to adjust.  Before, I <br/>\nfelt like I needed to put reins on Fabian.  Why? Lack of trust and <br/>\nfear of saying &quot;yes&quot; because maybe his project would &quot;fail&quot; or maybe <br/>\nhe would ask for my help and I wouldn&#39;t know what to do or maybe it <br/>\nwould cost money.  I realized that if I had those attitudes with <br/>\nFabian, I would never make it unschooling my kids.  I was being such <br/>\na nag!  I also had to see where I was placing a value of &quot;wasteful.&quot; <br/>\nFor example, it was not, in fact, a waste of money for Fabian to buy <br/>\na table saw, even though he only knew rudimentary carpentry at the <br/>\ntime.  It is not, in fact, a waste of time for him to spend an <br/>\nevening surfing the Web.  I had to see this in my own mind.  I had <br/>\nto see that it was not, in fact, a waste of paper for Will to play <br/>\nwith using the print function on the word processor, especially <br/>\nsince I was right there with him and we were talking up a storm <br/>\nabout what was printing and how it worked and the colors and wet ink <br/>\nand how to make it print right side up on the reverse side.  What <br/>\nwould be a waste, then?  Would it be a waste of my children&#39;s <br/>\nchildhood for me to wait to implement these new principles?<br/>\nMore here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nConsider attachment parenting (OK, as I was writing this, the <br/>\nconversation kept going and I see you already do.  Great!) Fabian <br/>\ncontinues to be blessed by our family bed, because he&#39;s part of that <br/>\nnighttime parenting that would otherwise have been restricted to me <br/>\nas the breastfeeding mom.  He frequently awakens for a few moments <br/>\nto murmer comforting words to 5-mo Elias while we&#39;re nursing or <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m changing a diaper.  We are learning lots right now about <br/>\ntrusting our children to grow when they&#39;re ready while Will is <br/>\ntrying out the potty and thinking about weaning.  These are examples <br/>\nyou can draw on in discussion with your husband about natural <br/>\nlearning.    <br/>\n<br/>\n--My daughter is 20 months old.  I am thankful that I have come <br/>\nacross all of these ideas while my daughter is very young. --<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are indeed fortunate to have found unschooling while our children <br/>\nare young, Susan!  If I can become a mindful parent in my children&#39;s <br/>\nbabyhood, it will serve us as a family when the questions and the <br/>\nactivities really take off in a few years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminds me.  I have a question for Sandra. I saw a blurb on <br/>\nyour site about how you disagree with the idea that unschooling <br/>\nstarts at birth, but I&#39;ve been scratching my head over it ever <br/>\nsince.  Have you written about it someplace? <br/>\n<br/>\nHope I&#39;ve been helpful.  If anything I&#39;ve said is not on a good <br/>\nunschooling track, PLEASE correct me!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSally<br/>\nUnpreschooling mom to Will (2.5) and Elias (5 mos)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro/Questions","postDate":"1203795404","msgId":32255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlGNkRFNEI0LTU2NDUtNDUzMi1BRjk2LTZFQ0UzMDFFODE4NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwcG9rcCtqaTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwcG9rcCtqaTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32253,"nextInTopic":32256,"prevInTime":32254,"nextInTime":32256,"topicId":32240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-from having a natural childbirth to using attachment parenting prinicples... we have already started to do things in ways that not many of our friends and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2011433322\">-=-from having a natural childbirth to using attachment<br/>\nparenting prinicples... we have already started to do things in ways<br/>\nthat not many of our friends and family members do.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of parenting I do is just attachment parenting extended on  <br/>\nthrough the years.
