Then the next now, <br/>\nthen the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter Bronnie is 22 and just graduating from university. She <br/>\nhad a conventional schooling, but in her early years before she <br/>\nstarted school and we were seldom out of each other&#39;s company - <br/>\nvirtually never in the first two years - all we did was whatever made <br/>\nus happy. Sometimes we were busy, sometimes we were cruising along <br/>\nnicely, sometimes we did nothing. Whenever we were home alone, I used <br/>\nto say to her, &quot;Well, it&#39;s just you and me and nobody else, so I <br/>\nguess we can do what we like!&quot; That&#39;s exactly the same with my son <br/>\nPat. Except he&#39;s almost a teenager not a &#39;preschooler&#39;. All we do is <br/>\nwhatever makes us happy. And that doesn&#39;t even mean doing things <br/>\ntogether any more. At the moment, he&#39;s heavily into World of Warcraft <br/>\nand plays for hours while I do other things and we just have an <br/>\noccasional conversation. I know he&#39;s happy because his body language <br/>\nshouts it out and, as I write, he&#39;s sitting across the room from me <br/>\nhumming a little tune to himself. That&#39;s priceless. I wouldn&#39;t swap <br/>\nit for anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know maybe I make a big deal sometimes about the fact that I have a <br/>\nconventionally educated academically successful daughter as well as <br/>\nan, in effect, &#39;radically unschooled&#39; son (though I call it &#39;self-<br/>\neducated under my supervision&#39;), but the point I would make here is <br/>\nthat the success my daughter has achieved on *her* chosen path is <br/>\nwithout a doubt in my mind *founded* on those early years of her life <br/>\nwhen she did whatever made her happy without any expectation that she <br/>\nshould meet some external or abstract standard of development or <br/>\nachievement. Thus, I have every reason to believe that my son is also <br/>\nbecoming a &#39;successful adult&#39; in his own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch I&#39;ve read about recently, at Harvard and other places, backs <br/>\nme up. It&#39;s been determined by people who allegedly know about these <br/>\nthings that being successful doesn&#39;t make us happy, as most people <br/>\nseem to believe - it&#39;s happiness that makes us successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, &quot;go with the flow&quot; is not just an idle platitude. <br/>\nIt&#39;s what works. Taking one day at a time and making that day a <br/>\nsuccess in itself (however you choose to define &#39;success&#39;) is what <br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very good at that, as it happens. Occasionally, I&#39;ll have <br/>\nmy own moment of doubt and ask him if he&#39;s thought about what he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to be when he grows up, and he&#39;ll answer something like, &quot;Bob, <br/>\nI&#39;m only interested in what I&#39;m doing now.&quot; And I&#39;ll say something <br/>\nlike, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s cool&quot; and get on with my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a grand adventure alright. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Because now is what matters.

It is easy to look at the faces of your young children and be ovewhelmed by the seemingly insurmountable task of raising them to be adults who can function in whatever the world is like in a little more than a decade. But no approach to parenting will calm the doubting voices in your head. I imagine that the home-educators whose children are creating mini-books are using these study moments, these forced activities to address the same fears that you experience when you look at their children. And I don&#39;t know that unschooling, with 3 young children, will help you to feel strong. I say that, not because I don&#39;t believe that unschooling prepares a child for &quot;the adult world&quot;, but because unschooling is so much about helping your child to be who they are now that it is much harder to see it as some training ground for future success. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnvy is an easy place to live. I can read about people&#39;s days over at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a> and feel like our days aren&#39;t so sparkly and filled with the glory of the moment. Well, I could but one of ours is there, so it would be silly to envy what I clearly experience :]. It is easy to know other families and look into the moments that the moms share when you get together and think about how amazing that sounds, or gee, I wish my children did that. And the best way I know to fight that kind of envy isn&#39;t to think about the lack of Shakespeare in your lives but to focus on the things that your lives are filled with. Making fairies is important work. Telling stories about fairies, sitting close and touching and sharing and laughing and loving. Those are the important things. Because now is what matters. Not 10 years from now. If you take care of this moment, this child, than they will grow up strong and engaging and enviable. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n-----------------------------------<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI am not worried what the school children are up to (I was a teacher<br/>\nin a former life and know how much time is wasted there), what I am<br/>\nworried about is the other homeschoolers who are more structured,<br/>\nwhose children can read, who are writing mini books (yes true) with<br/>\ngood punctuation, neat writing, title pages, the works (and she is the<br/>\nsame age as my dd), and I tried not to let it bother me.
