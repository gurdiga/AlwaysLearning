Where do I start?<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how you all do it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re trying to get involved in their worlds, but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot your responsibility to be there all the time!  You have a right to<br/>\nyour own interests and passions,just like they do. Ideally, you each<br/>\nhave your own interests and there are overlaps where all of you share<br/>\ncertain things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really think you need to be right there for all of their<br/>\ninterests at every moment. Isn&#39;t your son 12 or so? Why isn&#39;t he<br/>\nhappily doing his own thing at times?  Being with our children to<br/>\nconnect with them and be interested in the things that make their<br/>\nheart sing is GREAT!  Being there constantly isn&#39;t helpful in my<br/>\nopinion, kids need their own space and time (different for each child<br/>\nof course) in which to make connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t responsible for sharing your spouses interests, only<br/>\nresponsible for finding things you can BOTH enjoy together.  My<br/>\npassions and interests are always going to be there, my family comes<br/>\nin and out of those interests as they choose. Should be the same with<br/>\nyou. I don&#39;t recommend faking an interest in something, but I do think<br/>\nit&#39;s advantageous to at least connect on things that bring joy into<br/>\nour children&#39;s (or partners) lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four children and manage to follow many of my own interests and<br/>\npassions each and every day...so I KNOW it&#39;s possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26451,"nextTopicId":26507}}
