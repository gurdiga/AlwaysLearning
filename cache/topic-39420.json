Look for easy ways to get things solved like dishes. Paper plates are brilliant for us when there are lots of people over. Even though there are still other things to be washed, having the plates be paper takes some of it out of the equation. Ask for more specific help and lots of people will offer suggestions. If you want to have a less volatile household you need to move toward being less oppositional with your daughter, move to finding more solutions that don&#39;t include her labor. There are lots of helpful solutions that people come up with for ways of taking care of the things that you feel need to be cared for much easier. I am often impressed with the ideas that others have thought of and use. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea have never opted in for doing the dishes, well, when Simon was 5 and Linnaea was 2 they did them a couple of times. We have never had a dishwasher and we&#39;ve always managed to have enough clean dishes to serve everyone. Even when David wasn&#39;t around. Even when folks are sick. Even when we are really, really busy. At no time are we requiring Simon or Linnaea to do the dishes. And yet neither of your choices, children washing dishes or no dishes leaving children eating out of their hands, seems to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like doing dishes. I like standing in the kitchen and looking out the window with music playing on the stereo or talk radio thinking wispy thoughts, following the tendrils of ideas for a little while, washing the dishes. It&#39;s very meditative. It&#39;s very relaxing. It doesn&#39;t take long, maybe 15 minutes twice a day, maybe 25 minutes once a day. I do have help. David does the dishes fairly regularly. I think he enjoys doing them too. He plays really loud music while he does the dishes. The dishes air dry, which takes a step out of the labor. And they get put away before the next wash, usually, although sometimes they get used before the next wash happens. Sometimes I let things soak overnight. Sometimes I start doing the dishes and get distracted by something more important, more engaging and go and deal with that and then something else and then it&#39;s too late and when I get up in the morning I drain the sink and refill and they are really easy to finish. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a clean house isn&#39;t anywhere near as important as having a house that all of us enjoy living in.

I question whether you should be using &quot;radical  <br/>\nunschooling&quot; if you&#39;re cranky about late hours and requiring lots of  <br/>\nchores.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother request I&#39;ve made before on this list is for people to really  <br/>\nlook at the euphemisms they might be using, and be honest with  <br/>\nterminology.   To call chores &quot;family jobs&quot; is just a euphemism.  At  <br/>\nmy house there are NO chores.  Zero.  Chore means &quot;unpleasant  <br/>\ntask.&quot;   But we don&#39;t have another tricky  name for chores either.   <br/>\nWe call things what they are.  There is yard work, and laundry.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s cooking (which is fun).  There&#39;s filing books and putting  <br/>\ngames and DVDs back on shelves.  Each thing is done because we need  <br/>\nthe new work space or because we&#39;re looking for something and it&#39;s  <br/>\neasier when things.  One of us puts towels in each bathroom.  When  <br/>\none bathroom is nearly out of toilet paper, they all get toilet  <br/>\npaper.  When it&#39;s the night before trash day, a couple or three  <br/>\npeople go around and empty trash from various little trashcans.   <br/>\nSomeone (not always the same person) takes the can to the curb.   If  <br/>\nI were the only one living here, I would do it all myself, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot so I don&#39;t.  Neither do I assign any jobs to anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it must seem impossible to picture for anyone who hasn&#39;t  <br/>\nreally, truly and fully let it go and been willing to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with most of the other parenting aspects of radical  <br/>\nunschooling.  Same with the deschooling itself.  Anyone who isn&#39;t  <br/>\nwilling to take the risk cannot have the benefit.  Anyone who won&#39;t  <br/>\nlet it go until it happens will not have it happen a their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo say &#39;I had to cancel my participation&#39; instead of &quot;I told her I  <br/>\nwon&#39;t drive her anywhere before noon&quot; is a dodge.  Mindful parenting  <br/>\nwon&#39;t come without clarity of thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I call them family jobs because the children like having dishes to  <br/>\nuse for eating, too. If they were to opt out of using any were there  <br/>\nno clean ones available, I could see them not minding making an even  <br/>\nbigger mess with their food if there were no plate/bowl underneath it  <br/>\nbecause then they&#39;d likely opt out of cleaning that up, too. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAh.  You didn&#39;t go to Joyce&#39;s site and read what she has to say about  <br/>\ndishes, or you wouldn&#39;t have written this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you post again, please do read what you&#39;ve missed about  <br/>\nchores.  You would have saved SO much energy and time already had you  <br/>\nread those things a year and a half ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We&#39;ve discussed this one before and she chooses classes over hired  <br/>\nhouse-cleaning help if there is not the option for both. For a short  <br/>\nwhile, we tried an arrangement of her contributing funds from her  <br/>\nbabysitting work to help contribute toward a little bit of hired help  <br/>\nwith the chores (her idea as an alternative to participating in them  <br/>\nherself). -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a LOT of words to say (I think) that if she didn&#39;t want to do  <br/>\nchores she would have to pay someone else to do them.  This is not  <br/>\nrelationship building.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We have also been down a path of experimentation where I did not ask<br/>\n<br/>\nfor any help with any jobs. Yes, Dd contributed voluntarily, but,<br/>\nyes, it was far less than was realistic to sustain things. The result<br/>\nis that there was far less of me to be available for serving her<br/>\ninterests and yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her<br/>\ninterest. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A path of experimentation&quot; is not a commitment.  I&#39;m guessing  your  <br/>\nexperiment lasted a couple of weeks.  Just as with deschooling, the  <br/>\nmore you&#39;ve required, the more a child will celebrate the lack of  <br/>\nrequirements by &quot;doing nothing&quot; at first.  A child who hasn&#39;t been  <br/>\nallowed to have food will gorge if the rules are lifted.  You can&#39;t  <br/>\nsay &quot;I&#39;m going to experiment with letting  you play all the video  <br/>\ngames you want for a week,&quot; and NOT expect the child to play 20 hours  <br/>\na day, knowing you&#39;re about to go back to the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her interest.  <br/>\nThis pattern effectively dried up my availability to my son and HIS  <br/>\ninterests, which did not sit well with me. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou blame her in harsh words for your life not being more pleasant.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not loving.  It&#39;s not kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if your goal could be learning, and unschooling, more than  <br/>\nkindness, you could make choices with that foremost.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So we sat down and I explained to Dd how, if she wanted these  <br/>\nthings from me, I needed more from her in the way of reliable help  <br/>\nwith the jobs. That her contribution toward them meant more of me to  <br/>\nserve her.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;serve her&quot; sounds a little oogie now, especially since it  <br/>\nsounds like you were (perhaps ad nauseum) explaining to her how she  <br/>\nneeds to serve you if she wants her unschooling life to be rich and  <br/>\nfull.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sandra, you asked for details regarding my participation in my  <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s activities. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I asked for a rephrasing of &quot;had to cancel my participation in my  <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s activities.&quot;  I have three kids, each of whom was fourteen  <br/>\nfor a full year.  I know what it means to support their activities,  <br/>\nto drive them around, to wait during classes.   What I don&#39;t know is  <br/>\n&quot;had to cancel my participation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou chose to refuse to do something, but you had a fancy way of  <br/>\ndodging the responsibility for that decision.

We aren&#39;t close with any other RU teens and no one <br/>\nelse in our little community of friends is doing anything remotely <br/>\nlike this (even our fellow Unschooling families) so it is VERY helpful <br/>\nto get your feedback in this area.  This part was the main thing I was <br/>\nhoping to get clarity about with my inquiry.  I had already assumed it <br/>\nwas normal, at least for my daughter, because it is simply what is in <br/>\nher reality.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I see of your responses, this pattern is normal for teens <br/>\nwho are allowed to decide on their own sleeping habits and that is <br/>\nreassuring to know because I don&#39;t like being the only ones!  (Or, <br/>\nrather, I like knowing that we are not so unusual in as many areas as <br/>\nit sometimes feels.  I don&#39;t mind being different, I love it actually, <br/>\nbut with too many things it begins to cause doubt for me.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE the idea of middle-of-the-night household work!  We&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscussed it and are going to give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on some of your responses, I want to elaborate on where I am <br/>\ncoming from in my intentions.  I have always placed mothering my <br/>\nchildren above all other priorities on my list of life goals.  Yes, <br/>\nkindness is my first priority as far as my values go, and mothering is <br/>\nthe vehicle for my kindness as action.  I love nothing more in this <br/>\nworld as much as serving my children and seeing them happy and <br/>\ncreating/getting what they want from life.  That said, I have had to <br/>\nlearn the hard way that I do not want to support their happiness at <br/>\nthe *expense of my own*, which has been a difficult hurdle for me as <br/>\nmy own mother was big on sacrifice and suffering in the name of <br/>\nmothering and was, thus, confused yet outwardly and inwardly unkind.  <br/>\nThis resulted in my extreme dislike for her (my mother) for many,  <br/>\nmany years which, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t resolved before her tragic <br/>\ndeath at age 56 when I was 30, already a mother for nearly 7 years at <br/>\nthe time, and only just beginning to want to get close to her again.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that I think I would have much preferred a kind mother <br/>\nand less options than the many options and stressed-out, demanding <br/>\nmother that were my reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I do &quot;my daughter&#39;s&quot; chores when I cancel my participation in her <br/>\nactivities.  &quot;THE chores&quot; have to get done no matter what, so I do <br/>\nthem when she doesn&#39;t.  However, I believe that my standards for the <br/>\nchores are actually deeply relaxed and, yet, there is a certain <br/>\nbaseline standard that I refuse to leave the house without it being <br/>\nmet.  We&#39;re talking basic safety & hygiene, here.  Nothing even close <br/>\nto extreme at all.  The jobs are not *required* of her but I do need a <br/>\ncertain minimum of them done each day in order for our home to <br/>\nfunction, regardless of who they&#39;re done by.  There is also the very <br/>\nreal issue of time constraints.  We have no electric dishwasher, live <br/>\nin a tiny little house and eat almost all our meals at home -- so the <br/>\ndishes are a big deal as are any piles of anything around here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the suggestion of hiring outside help with the chores:  I do <br/>\nnot have money for that.  I have a very, very limited income.  Nearly <br/>\n70% of my kids&#39; classes are free programs and the others are all <br/>\nreduced-fee/sliding-scale/trade kinds of arrangements.  The money that <br/>\nI do have for their interests is kind of an either/or thing -- classes <br/>\nOR services like house-cleaning help.  We&#39;ve discussed this one <br/>\nbefore and she chooses classes over hired house-cleaning help if there <br/>\nis not the option for both.  For a short while, we tried an <br/>\narrangement of her contributing funds from her babysitting work to <br/>\nhelp contribute toward a little bit of hired help with the chores (her <br/>\nidea as an alternative to participating in them herself).  It didn&#39;t <br/>\nlast, however, because she quickly realized how expensive it was <br/>\ncompared to her realistic earning ability and my limited ability to <br/>\ncontribute financially to the situation, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI call them family jobs because the children like having dishes to use <br/>\nfor eating, too.  If they were to opt out of using any were there no <br/>\nclean ones available, I could see them not minding making an even <br/>\nbigger mess with their food if there were no plate/bowl underneath it <br/>\nbecause then they&#39;d likely opt out of cleaning that up, too.  Then <br/>\nthere would be even more cleaning jobs to do.  Personally, I like to <br/>\nkeep the jobs as minimal as possible since there is only so much of me <br/>\nto go around and, again, there is literally no other adult picking up <br/>\nany of the slack, here, and it&#39;s been this way for the better part of <br/>\nmy entire parenting career.  Furthermore, I have health issues that <br/>\ngreatly limit my energies.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also been down a path of experimentation where I did not ask <br/>\nfor any help with any jobs.  Yes, Dd contributed voluntarily, but, <br/>\nyes, it was far less than was realistic to sustain things.  The result <br/>\nis that there was far less of me to be available for serving her <br/>\ninterests and yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her <br/>\ninterest.  This pattern effectively dried up my availability to my son <br/>\nand HIS interests, which did not sit well with me.  So we sat down and <br/>\nI explained to Dd how, if she wanted these things from me, I needed <br/>\nmore from her in the way of reliable help with the jobs.  That her <br/>\ncontribution toward them meant more of me to serve her.  She gets it <br/>\nentirely but just doesn&#39;t always remember the logic in the day-to-day <br/>\nof things, which I understand.  It&#39;s the going around and around of <br/>\nall this that is just so exhausting.  It is cyclical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, I am just running myself too thin. I am the single <br/>\ndriver, food-maker, house-cleaner, day-planner and supporter-of-<br/>\neverything else financially, physically, energetically, mentally, <br/>\nemotionally, etc. I have tried to maintain the same level of life-<br/>\nquality for her even though her contributions and their quality have <br/>\ndeclined because, frankly, I want her to have these things as much as <br/>\nit is possible -- &#39;what is possible&#39; being the key factor. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, you asked for details regarding my participation in my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s activities.  Here is the breakdown:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*  paying fees when relevant<br/>\n*  organizing time/schedule-planning<br/>\n*  researching class/activity offerings (and discussing them with her <br/>\nwhich is surprisingly time-consuming)<br/>\n*  talking on the phone/orchestrating daily plans<br/>\n*  driving (huge time-sucker)<br/>\n*  waiting during activities and occupying her brother during the <br/>\nwaiting<br/>\n*  the biggie:  being available to receive and negotiate her Very <br/>\nFrequent requests for lots of things/experiences/opportunities/etc.  <br/>\n(I can elaborate on this one if requested.  Basically, my daughter is <br/>\na very energetic, highly-spirited person who makes tons of requests <br/>\nall the time - she&#39;s been this way for her whole life.  The requests <br/>\nare for information, activities, outings, material things, etc. etc. <br/>\netc. She&#39;s really into planning & doing lots and it all still needs to <br/>\ninvolve me to a large extent, being the only supporter of her <br/>\nreality.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I want to mention also how thankful I am for all of your <br/>\ncritical feedback.  It is good to look at this stuff from as many <br/>\nangles as possible and I love that there is this group of people who <br/>\nare all paving their own paths as they go.  I am reminded of just how <br/>\nvaluable support is to me and that I may need to participate in this <br/>\ngroup more regularly so as not to feel so strange compared to nearly <br/>\neveryone else we know.  Most of our local Unschooling friends have <br/>\nchildren that are younger than my daughter&#39;s age, so she is kind of <br/>\nthe pioneer of our little community.  Friends come to US to ask what <br/>\nis normal for their child&#39;s age because I&#39;ve got the oldest one.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] A Request for Feedback Regarding My RU Teen","postDate":"1223938579","msgId":39447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIwREI5QUVGLUNGNjYtNEMwMS04ODEwLThGNTQzQjZFNEM5RkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzMkIyRjkyLTgwQ0ItNDZFOC04REQwLTA4NkRBQzc2RDYwRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGdjdmR0bis5Zm11QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjdDNjZBN0UtRUNGMC00RENCLUFBRkEtMjQxMUU0NDE3RDBCQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8RUYxM0E3Q0JGMjZFNDM4MEJCMTU4NURDQjE1RDE3NjlATFlMQUxBUDI+IDxGMzJCMkY5Mi04MENCLTQ2RTgtOEREMC0wODZEQUM3NkQ2MEVAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39446,"nextInTopic":39449,"prevInTime":39446,"nextInTime":39448,"topicId":39420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This is what finally got me to completely let go of demands and  <br/>\nresentment - I realized that I could yell or cry or shame the kids  <br/>\ninto submission, but they&#39;d really still not do much, and we&#39;d all be  <br/>\nunhappy. OR I could spend the time I&#39;d have been struggling with them  <br/>\ndoing some of the housework, doing it happily and with an attitude of  <br/>\ndoing it as a gift for them. WHAT a change in dynamics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, my kids don&#39;t do a lot of housework, definitely not as much  <br/>\nhousework as I would have tried to make them do. But it is very sweet  <br/>\nwhen they do it. I love walking into the kitchen, thinking I&#39;m going  <br/>\nto unload the dishwasher, and discover it&#39;s been done by someone else.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s something they seem to do whenever they see it needs doing. And  <br/>\nthey do all their own laundry unless I happen to think of offering to  <br/>\ndo it - which is only every few months. We&#39;re living in a house that  <br/>\nis often pretty messy - I can live with that for the sake of having  <br/>\nhappy times with my kids. When it gets to me, I clean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHousework takes a lot less time than I used to think, too. I think  <br/>\nwhen I was a kid and my mom made me do housework that it was such a  <br/>\nnegative experience, with all the badgering and complaining and  <br/>\nresisting, that I built it all up in my head and I think of each task  <br/>\nas HUGE! But I figured out that I can almost completely clean the  <br/>\nkitchen, including doing a big load of dishes, in the time it takes  <br/>\nfor my coffee maker to make one pot of coffee. So I do that almost  <br/>\nevery morning and having a clean kitchen makes the rest of the messy  <br/>\nhouse a lot easier to handle, for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, one of my kids lives in her own house now and her  <br/>\nhousekeeping is a lot like mine - somewhat neglected in favor of more  <br/>\nenticing activities, then deep cleaned in a big huge burst of  <br/>\nhousekeeping frenzy. Her house always seems really nice and tidy and  <br/>\ncomfortable to me, but that&#39;s me - I&#39;m used to a lot of clutter from  <br/>\nall the stuff we&#39;re always doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Coming out of the closet","postDate":"1223937961","msgId":39446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBNTc2QjcyLURCNTYtNDc1Qi1BREJBLTk1OUNGOTFFMTc2OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1XMTRCMjhCRUM0ODhCOUI1NUU4ODU0OUE1MzYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PGdjdmR0bis5Zm11QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjdDNjZBN0UtRUNGMC00RENCLUFBRkEtMjQxMUU0NDE3RDBCQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFZMTA2LVcxNEIyOEJFQzQ4OEI5QjU1RTg4NTQ5QTUzNjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":39445,"nextInTopic":39447,"prevInTime":39445,"nextInTime":39447,"topicId":39420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Each year, with her encouragement, I buy a curriculum that I never use.-=- This part I don t understand.

My oldest child is 11. I, however, am an adult child and one who is applying the principles of unschooling throughout her life. As a suggestion, you might do well to open the question to all and not just to limit your respondents to those in a similar situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\nMy daughter, almost 14, has been going to sleep between 3 and 5 AM <br/>\nconsistently for months, now.  She sleeps until between 12 and 3 on <br/>\naverage, then wakes up and has just enough time to get dressed and eat <br/>\nbefore going to her many classes, activities, sleepovers, etc.  This <br/>\nsituation concerns me for several reasons.  She can&#39;t seem to go to <br/>\nsleep earlier than this without serious challenges biologically, nor <br/>\nis she very cooperative with my requests for her to try.  <br/>\n-----------------snip-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time I was 2 until I was in my 30&#39;s I stayed up late and slept late. It got more extreme in my early teens and stayed that way until I had Simon and Linnaea. And still, if things are stressful I will tend to stay up later in response. As guilty as I felt for being unable to sleep well, I can remember lying in bed at night, tossing and turning, listening to relaxation tapes, having mom or dad tell me to turn my light off, all of that, I never fell asleep easily before about 3 am. Much like your daughter tells you: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM, <br/>\nshe agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s <br/>\nall too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then <br/>\nshe breaks them constantly).  Then, I often come out at 2 or 3 AM and <br/>\nshe tells me that she tried to go to sleep earlier but  it didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork, so there she is on the computer in her room or watching TV, <br/>\nagain. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI could not go to sleep unless I was exhausted. I still can&#39;t. If I don&#39;t fall asleep right away I won&#39;t fall asleep without entertainment. I will lie in bed for hours and hours tossing and turning and getting more and more frustrated until the wee hours of the morning. No matter how tired I am. If, instead, I do something, like read a book or play on my ds or get up and watch television or spend time on the computer, I can fall asleep much more easily. Some nights I will fall asleep reading a book and then wake up enough to turn off the light and be woken too much in the process and the whole thing will start all over again. She isn&#39;t lying to you, she isn&#39;t yanking your chain, she is describing something that happens to me and has happened to me for much of my life. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote: &quot;The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.&quot; A &quot;tendency toward opposition&quot; only comes up when there are requests that are made of someone that they feel oppositional about. I would argue, most strenously, that your perspective that she is staying up late to oppose you is wrong. Maybe not completely, maybe she is rebelling against you. But being a night owl is not unusual. And it isn&#39;t willful. I tried for years to go to sleep at a more &quot;normal&quot; hour, I used to take sleeping pills and melatonin as well as relaxation tapes. It didn&#39;t work, my clock just wasn&#39;t set for early to bed early to rise. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\nOne of the things I need is for her to contribute to the family jobs <br/>\nbefore going to her activities every day in order for me to provide <br/>\nthe level of service that she wants from me <br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the family jobs that you require from her? How are they negatively impacting your life if they aren&#39;t done. Our house is not the neatest of places much of the time. Dishes usually are done, vacuuming is occasionally done, sweeping and mopping rarely, I do laundry, but  often it isn&#39;t put away. None of that really negatively impacts my life unless I&#39;m having allergy moments. Usually, though, cleaning makes my allergies worse as I stir all the stuff up in the process. But maybe your family jobs are something different then household chores?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of family jobs, Simon and Linnaea could care less how clean the house is. Maybe there is a standard they have for cleanliness, but I haven&#39;t gotten too far gone for them. The standard of cleanliness that I tend to maintain is my own. It isn&#39;t a &quot;family&quot; job, it&#39;s a personal requirement. There are some things that David maintains to a level that is far beyond my awareness. He doesn&#39;t think about waxing the car as a family job, even though Linnaea and Simon may join in, it&#39;s something he wants to do because he likes the car to be protected from the elements. He doesn&#39;t hound me to clean the car or to change the oil or to check the brake pads. Those are things that are important to his sense of wellbeing, not mine. When we were dating he was appalled by the state of my car. I was fine with it. He didn&#39;t want me to drive it and would swap it for his fairly new truck. His standards are really different than mine. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\n(I am a single parent to <br/>\nher and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus <br/>\nshe happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and <br/>\nactivities).<br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is fantastic that her day is full of things to do and ways to explore the world. I imagine that it can feel overwhelming and disconnecting for you to have her be asleep or out all the time. Still, how fantastic that she is so engaged with so many things. Try and think about all the things that she is committed to as things that bring her joy. Think about helping her to achieve those things as ways of helping her to be happier, more fulfilled, more switched on. It will feel much nicer when you drive her to or pick her up from something or the other and you think about how fantastic it is that you get to help make this thing happen and you get that time between one thing and another with her. It is good to look at the bright side. And to find joy in giving to your children. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\nShe is very good at getting jobs done once she sets her <br/>\nmind to it but seems confused about how it all works logistically, <br/>\neven though it&#39;s been discussed ad nauseam.  <br/>\n-----------------snip------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI turn off of things that are discussed ad nauseum. I don&#39;t hear when it moves to more than one repetition. My face goes blank and I start thinking about other things or getting really resentful of the speaker. It often feels patronising and rude. Even if I&#39;m being rude in response.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are the jobs difficult to comprehend? Is there a standard that you are asking her to achieve? Beth Fuller tells a story of when she used to be quite obsessed with being the perfect homemaker. Her husband Kevin wanted to give her a gift so he vacuumed the whole house, all of it, every room, for her. She smiled and thanked him and started doing it all again because he hadn&#39;t made straight lines with the vacuum cleaner. Are you expecting there to be ruler straight lines in your carpet? Are you asking her to do for you like she was a cleaning service and you need the plates washed and dried and put away in such and such way? I may just not be clear on what the &quot;family jobs&quot; are that you need to have done. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea wants the computer. And a chocolate shake.

She sleeps until between 12 and 3 on<br/>\n&gt; average, then wakes up and has just enough time to get dressed and eat<br/>\n&gt; before going to her many classes, activities, sleepovers, etc. This<br/>\n&gt; situation concerns me for several reasons. She can&#39;t seem to go to<br/>\n&gt; sleep earlier than this without serious challenges biologically, nor<br/>\n&gt; is she very cooperative with my requests for her to try.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This has been a consistent pattern for my 14 yr old too!  However, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see this as a problem.  I think teens have a different biological<br/>\nclock than children and adults.  The house is quiet and her time is<br/>\nuninterupted by her younger sibling.  She can talk to people from<br/>\ndifferent parts of the world because of the time difference, or she can<br/>\ndo other things on her computer without IM interuptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t schedule anything involving her before noon, ever!  If I do,<br/>\nit&#39;s exceptional and she makes the effort to get to bed earlier and get<br/>\nup earlier because she wants to do the activity.  When she wakes up, I<br/>\ntry to ensure that she has at least an hour to get herself ready in a<br/>\nrelaxed way.  I also don&#39;t force her to attend any of her activities, or<br/>\nour activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the things I need is for her to contribute to the family jobs<br/>\n&gt; before going to her activities every day in order for me to provide<br/>\n&gt; the level of service that she wants from me (I am a single parent to<br/>\n&gt; her and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus<br/>\n&gt; she happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and<br/>\n&gt; activities).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This would be overwhelming for my daughter!  She wouldn&#39;t even begin to<br/>\nknow how to work under those conditions.  She helps out a lot though,<br/>\nespecially if I ask her kindly and give her the option of saying &quot;no&quot;. <br/>\nShe routinely cleans the bathroom that she uses without my asking.  It&#39;s<br/>\nmessy most of the time, but she will tidy it if I ask her, if there is a<br/>\nguest coming over or something of that nature since it would be the<br/>\nbathroom used by a guest.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t clean her room, nor do I ask her to.  She only sometimes<br/>\ndoes the dishes, but she will pick up stray dishes if she sees me doing<br/>\nthem.  Mostly though, I clean up after her because she clearly isn&#39;t<br/>\nready for that task of keeping a household in working order.  In common<br/>\nareas, she really does try to keep her mess contained to her area and is<br/>\nperfectly okay with a quick tidy up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, she often does a poor job<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at the chores, even though I&#39;ve seen her do way better work many<br/>\n&gt; times, until I approach her with what ends up turning into constant<br/>\n&gt; little micro-managing requests that negate the ability for her to<br/>\n&gt; contribute in the first place if I am needed to do so much guiding (it<br/>\n&gt; gets to where we need to stop the work she&#39;s doing and re-define what<br/>\n&gt; `doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the biggest clue that you should stop what you are doing and<br/>\neither stop expecting her to help or accept what she gives to you<br/>\nwithout critique.  If she can&#39;t do the dishes alone, do them with her,<br/>\nyou wash, she dries and puts away.  Really it will go super fast and you<br/>\nwon&#39;t have to worry about wether or not they are clean.  Put her<br/>\nfavorite music on and do it at her pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So our household has become very<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and<br/>\n&gt; pattern of hostility. This has become increasingly unrealistic and<br/>\n&gt; stressful for her brother and for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take the pressure off.  Hire someone to come in and clean up major stuff<br/>\nevery other week, so that you have a quick tidy up every other week<br/>\nbefore the cleaning person gets there.  All of you can work on each room<br/>\nof the house together and pick up so that the cleaning person can clean<br/>\nthe floors and bathrooms or whatever it is that you feel absolutely is<br/>\nsoo super necessary for feeling like your house is clean.  Seriously, it<br/>\nwould take about an hour or 2 once every other week or once a week if<br/>\nyou so choose that option.  That is not much time at all!  If you can<br/>\nafford a lot of extra activities for your kids, you can afford<br/>\nhousecleaning service, they are really not very expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an example, I have a family of 4 and I do dishes once a day and<br/>\nit takes literally about half and hour, sometimes an hour if it&#39;s really<br/>\nmessy.  That&#39;s such a small chunk of time, and it can be pleasant listen<br/>\nto music and contemplate life time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.<br/>\n&gt; For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM,<br/>\n&gt; she agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then<br/>\n&gt; she breaks them constantly).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;s trying to avoid you and get you off her back.  Unless that is your<br/>\ngoal with your relationship, stop trying to get her to do something she<br/>\nclearly doesn&#39;t want to or can&#39;t do!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then, the next day, we&#39;re back at the same place of her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; needing to sleep until very close to the time to leave and me feeling<br/>\n&gt; very stressed about her help toward the family jobs because, not only<br/>\n&gt; is she breaking her commitment to my need for her to do her share of<br/>\n&gt; housework a good deal of time before it&#39;s time to go to her activity,<br/>\n&gt; but shortly after she wakes up and for a while afterward is when she<br/>\n&gt; becomes very unkind in her language and behavior, uncooperative and<br/>\n&gt; deal-breaking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Back to the housework.  I&#39;m actually trying to imagine what kind of<br/>\nhousehold chores you have since they seem to take precendence over all<br/>\nother things at your house other than making it to activities and<br/>\ngetting enough sleep.  I absolutely don&#39;t clean house everyday!  I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine what kind of chores one would have to do EVERY day that is<br/>\ntaking up so much of life for your family!  The only things I do every<br/>\nday are dishes, kitty litter boxes, and feeding pets and people, that&#39;s<br/>\nit!  Other things happen here and there, laundry, yard work, clean up,<br/>\nfloor cleaning, but not every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuit making her life miserable and about meeting your expectations!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lately, I&#39;ve had to cancel my participation in several of her classes<br/>\n&gt; and activities because things have escalated beyond what I can<br/>\n&gt; personally handle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, when you cancel your participation, do you go home and do your<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s chores for her?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is a big part of why I have come to the place of canceling my<br/>\n&gt; offers of contribution toward her interests when she breaks her word<br/>\n&gt; about our agreements. Kindness is my very first priority as a person<br/>\n&gt; and as a parent<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>However, everything you&#39;ve described is very very unkind to your<br/>\ndaughter, and yourself and you other child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve already told her that I am indefinitely unwilling to participate<br/>\n&gt; in any interests of hers that begin before 1 or 2 in the afternoon<br/>\n&gt; because of the patterns she has. I need for at least *me* to be clear<br/>\n&gt; about reality, here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is nothing wrong with you deciding that your child needs enough<br/>\nsleep and being realistic about starting time of activities.  Before 1<br/>\nor 2 can be time well spent with your younger child or for you to get<br/>\nchores done and other work necessary for living.  After 1 or 2 can be<br/>\ndaughter time, relaxed and free from your expectations of what she<br/>\nshould be doing.  Go and take her to her activities and do all that fun<br/>\nstuff with her.  Create an atmosphere of fun and enjoyment with her<br/>\nwithout all that other stuff getting in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I know we have to get going sooner than my daughter would like, I&#39;ll<br/>\ngo in and wake her up with a nice warm cup of coffee and be kind and<br/>\ngentle with her to get her going.

It&#39;s at the point where I<br/>\n&gt; have begun telling her that it&#39;s either re-negotiating or her daily<br/>\n&gt; activities that I can participate in because I do not have the time<br/>\n&gt; and physical/mental energy for both.  Also, she often does a poor job<br/>\n&gt; at the chores, even though I&#39;ve seen her do way better work many<br/>\n&gt; times, until I approach her with what ends up turning into constant<br/>\n&gt; little micro-managing requests that negate the ability for her to<br/>\n&gt; contribute in the first place if I am needed to do so much guiding (it<br/>\n&gt; gets to where we need to stop the work she&#39;s doing and re-define what<br/>\n&gt; `doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two things:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd does the dishes, but in the middle of the night, when she&#39;s  <br/>\nawake.  Is there some reason the chores have to be done in the  <br/>\nmorning?  I mean, vacuuming while people are sleeping would be rude,  <br/>\nand I myself don&#39;t do it in the morning while my kids are asleep, but  <br/>\nhand-washing dishes isn&#39;t noisy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, does she know what you expect -- I mean, does she really?   <br/>\nYou may think she does, but if she hasn&#39;t been taught to do it the way  <br/>\nyou expect, you can&#39;t hold her to your standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like she&#39;s getting you back by doing a poor job (passive  <br/>\naggression, maybe).  Try accepting the way she finds works best for  <br/>\nher, even if its not exactly how you would do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She has been honest and said that she wishes she could just have all<br/>\n&gt; the activities and interests AND my high level of service to her<br/>\n&gt; without having to contribute anything in the way of family jobs in<br/>\n&gt; exchange.  She seems not to want to let go of that wish and it appears<br/>\n&gt; to be a driving force in our daily exchanges.  Also, she has become<br/>\n&gt; increasingly hostile toward me when I remind her of her agreements and<br/>\n&gt; commitments to the job she&#39;s previously agreed to for the day – the<br/>\n&gt; one that ensures that she can be driven to her activity/activities for<br/>\n&gt; *that day* in exchange for.  So our household has become very<br/>\n&gt; unpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and<br/>\n&gt; pattern of hostility.  This has become increasingly unrealistic and<br/>\n&gt; stressful for her brother and for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t you knock it off, then?  You&#39;re the one in control, not her  <br/>\n-- except, of course, if she doesn&#39;t do what you want.  You&#39;re giving  <br/>\nher that power, but it&#39;s her only power.  How about letting go of the  <br/>\njobs, doing them yourself, lowering your standards, etc.?  Find a way  <br/>\nto take her out of the equation.  It takes two to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.<br/>\n&gt; For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM,<br/>\n&gt; she agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then<br/>\n&gt; she breaks them constantly).  Then, I often come out at 2 or 3 AM and<br/>\n&gt; she tells me that she tried to go to sleep earlier but  it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work, so there she is on the computer in her room or watching TV,<br/>\n&gt; again.  Then, the next day, we&#39;re back at the same place of her<br/>\n&gt; needing to sleep until very close to the time to leave and me feeling<br/>\n&gt; very stressed about her help toward the family jobs because, not only<br/>\n&gt; is she breaking her commitment to my need for her to do her share of<br/>\n&gt; housework a good deal of time before it&#39;s time to go to her activity,<br/>\n&gt; but shortly after she wakes up and for a while afterward is when she<br/>\n&gt; becomes very unkind in her language and behavior, uncooperative and<br/>\n&gt; deal-breaking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she goes to sleep at 3 to 5 a.m., and, like all teens, needs 10 to  <br/>\n12 hours of sleep every day, she&#39;s not going to wake up rested until 3  <br/>\nto 5 p.m.  She wakes up to a mom angry at her for *sleeping,* stressed  <br/>\nabout some stupid household chore, calling her a &quot;Deal breaker,&quot; etc.   <br/>\nI&#39;d be unkind, too.  I&#39;d avoid contact with that mom, and I&#39;d be  <br/>\ncranky and uncooperative, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if my mom *honored* my sleep pattern, recognized that I truly  <br/>\n*cannot fall asleep* sooner than 3 a.m., cannot wake without 10 to 12  <br/>\nhours&#39; sleep, was kind enough to arrange her day to accommodate my  <br/>\nneeds, I might feel more kind and cooperative.  I might suggest doing  <br/>\nthe chores after mom and brother go to bed, so mom wakes to a clean  <br/>\nkitchen, for instance (I call my dd a &quot;house elf,&quot; after Harry  <br/>\nPotter).  And I always say &quot;thank you.&quot;  When I drive my son to a  <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house, he alway says &quot;thanks mom&quot; when he gets out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lately, I&#39;ve had to cancel my participation in several of her classes<br/>\n&gt; and activities because things have escalated beyond what I can<br/>\n&gt; personally handle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you have to do in her activities, beyond providing  <br/>\ntransportation and perhaps fees?  Would you have no time and energy to  <br/>\ndo these things if you did all the housework your daughter is failing  <br/>\nto do?  Perhaps you both need to cut back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Again, there are no other adults committed to<br/>\n&gt; providing for her, so it is up to her and I to create our own reality,<br/>\n&gt; here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She might be doing more than she truly wants or needs to do; mine each  <br/>\nhad one activity at a time.  We didn&#39;t try to do lots of classes or  <br/>\nsports.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  There is also my son that I am equally committed to, but it<br/>\n&gt; always seems that Dd&#39;s behavior and interests dominate my time and<br/>\n&gt; energy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is a big part of why I have come to the place of canceling my<br/>\n&gt; offers of contribution toward her interests when she breaks her word<br/>\n&gt; about our agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she have a real choice in these agreements?  If you can cancel,  <br/>\ncan she?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my home, I&#39;ve never, ever required chores.  If I ask one of my kids  <br/>\nto help or to do something, they do it.  If they ask for my help, like  <br/>\ndriving somewhere, I do it.  No negotiations, though a &quot;Can I do it a  <br/>\nlittle later?&quot; is always a possibility; I try to not ask while  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s in the middle of a video game, etc.  Now, my *husband,* on  <br/>\nthe other hand, does want to see them help in exchange for their  <br/>\nallowance ($20 a week each, which they use for their own pets, lunches  <br/>\nout, and games tournament entry fees).  There are a few things we  <br/>\nparents don&#39;t usually do anymore, like scooping the yard.  Other  <br/>\nthings, like folding laundry, are done by anyone in the room at the  <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Kindness is my very first priority as a person<br/>\n&gt; and as a parent and I&#39;ve learned not to try to push myself past my own<br/>\n&gt; limits so as to continue providing opportunities to my daughter<br/>\n&gt; because I become unkind to myself, to her, and even to my son by way<br/>\n&gt; of his passive involvement when I don&#39;t honor my limits and abilities.<br/>\n&gt; I am also wanting to honor her limits and it appears that her behavior<br/>\n&gt; is more honest about them than her words are, so that is also my<br/>\n&gt; intention in canceling some activities).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve already told her that I am indefinitely unwilling to participate<br/>\n&gt; in any interests of hers that begin before 1 or 2 in the afternoon<br/>\n&gt; because of the patterns she has.

I joined this group nearly a year and a <br/>\nhalf ago.  I posted a bit in the beginning but haven&#39;t really been <br/>\naround much other than a bit of searching for specific info here and <br/>\nthere, since.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if those of you with teenagers and adult children could <br/>\nshare your thoughts on the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, almost 14, has been going to sleep between 3 and 5 AM <br/>\nconsistently for months, now.  She sleeps until between 12 and 3 on <br/>\naverage, then wakes up and has just enough time to get dressed and eat <br/>\nbefore going to her many classes, activities, sleepovers, etc.  This <br/>\nsituation concerns me for several reasons.  She can&#39;t seem to go to <br/>\nsleep earlier than this without serious challenges biologically, nor <br/>\nis she very cooperative with my requests for her to try.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I need is for her to contribute to the family jobs <br/>\nbefore going to her activities every day in order for me to provide <br/>\nthe level of service that she wants from me (I am a single parent to <br/>\nher and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus <br/>\nshe happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and <br/>\nactivities).  She is very good at getting jobs done once she sets her <br/>\nmind to it but seems confused about how it all works logistically, <br/>\neven though it&#39;s been discussed ad nauseam.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, she constantly tries to re-negotiate her way out of doing <br/>\nthe jobs that she&#39;s previously agreed to.  It&#39;s at the point where I <br/>\nhave begun telling her that it&#39;s either re-negotiating or her daily <br/>\nactivities that I can participate in because I do not have the time <br/>\nand physical/mental energy for both.  Also, she often does a poor job <br/>\nat the chores, even though I&#39;ve seen her do way better work many <br/>\ntimes, until I approach her with what ends up turning into constant <br/>\nlittle micro-managing requests that negate the ability for her to <br/>\ncontribute in the first place if I am needed to do so much guiding (it <br/>\ngets to where we need to stop the work she&#39;s doing and re-define what <br/>\n`doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been honest and said that she wishes she could just have all <br/>\nthe activities and interests AND my high level of service to her <br/>\nwithout having to contribute anything in the way of family jobs in <br/>\nexchange.  She seems not to want to let go of that wish and it appears <br/>\nto be a driving force in our daily exchanges.  Also, she has become <br/>\nincreasingly hostile toward me when I remind her of her agreements and <br/>\ncommitments to the job she&#39;s previously agreed to for the day  the <br/>\none that ensures that she can be driven to her activity/activities for <br/>\n*that day* in exchange for.  So our household has become very <br/>\nunpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and <br/>\npattern of hostility.  This has become increasingly unrealistic and <br/>\nstressful for her brother and for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.  <br/>\nFor example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM, <br/>\nshe agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s <br/>\nall too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then <br/>\nshe breaks them constantly).  Then, I often come out at 2 or 3 AM and <br/>\nshe tells me that she tried to go to sleep earlier but  it didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork, so there she is on the computer in her room or watching TV, <br/>\nagain.  Then, the next day, we&#39;re back at the same place of her <br/>\nneeding to sleep until very close to the time to leave and me feeling <br/>\nvery stressed about her help toward the family jobs because, not only <br/>\nis she breaking her commitment to my need for her to do her share of <br/>\nhousework a good deal of time before it&#39;s time to go to her activity, <br/>\nbut shortly after she wakes up and for a while afterward is when she <br/>\nbecomes very unkind in her language and behavior, uncooperative and <br/>\ndeal-breaking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, I&#39;ve had to cancel my participation in several of her classes <br/>\nand activities because things have escalated beyond what I can <br/>\npersonally handle.  Again, there are no other adults committed to <br/>\nproviding for her, so it is up to her and I to create our own reality, <br/>\nhere.  There is also my son that I am equally committed to, but it <br/>\nalways seems that Dd&#39;s behavior and interests dominate my time and <br/>\nenergy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a big part of why I have come to the place of canceling my <br/>\noffers of contribution toward her interests when she breaks her word <br/>\nabout our agreements.  Kindness is my very first priority as a person <br/>\nand as a parent and I&#39;ve learned not to try to push myself past my own <br/>\nlimits so as to continue providing opportunities to my daughter <br/>\nbecause I become unkind to myself, to her, and even to my son by way <br/>\nof his passive involvement when I don&#39;t honor my limits and abilities.  <br/>\nI am also wanting to honor her limits and it appears that her behavior <br/>\nis more honest about them than her words are, so that is also my <br/>\nintention in canceling some activities).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already told her that I am indefinitely unwilling to participate <br/>\nin any interests of hers that begin before 1 or 2 in the afternoon <br/>\nbecause of the patterns she has.  I need for at least *me* to be clear <br/>\nabout reality, here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has some feedback or experience to share, I would be so <br/>\ngrateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40364,"nextTopicId":40416}}
