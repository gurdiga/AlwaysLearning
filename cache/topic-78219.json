I have developed quite a few new allergies as an adult (mostly nasal), on top of the allergies (mostly skin-related) I had as a child. About 10 or 15 years ago, I developed an allergy to scented laundry and cleaning products, where I would sneeze and have typical itchy eyes, runny nose, headache, etc., if I was in contact with them for too long. I switched to unscented detergents and after a while, for some reason, the sensitivity subsided a bit. However, in the meantime, I had begun asking my children to go into the cleaning products aisle at the grocery store for me, or holding my breath while I grabbed what I needed, if I was alone. I thought nothing of it until I realized, maybe many years later, that if I even glanced down the cleaning aisle as I walked by, my heart would begin to pound and beat rapidly and my chest would tighten, making it difficult to breathe. Initially I thought my sensitivity was worsening, but I later realized it was primarily my anxiety about potential symptoms that was actually causing them. It had gone from holding my breath to barely being able to take a breath in. Even now, when I walk into a cleaning aisle I can feel the tightness and rapid heartbeat return, but I remind myself to breathe slowly and calmly and I can get the things I need and leave the aisle and be ok. I still have some sensitivity to scented cleaning products, but it&#39;s harder to determine now how much is allergy and how much is anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs another example, my brother-in-law is allergic to peanuts in an anaphalaxis sort of way, and though he never carried an epi-pen, he claims he learned early on that he didn&#39;t like the taste of peanuts and would avoid it naturally or put down a food item if it smelled like or seemed like it would have peanuts in it, so he says he avoided most reactions by &#39;preference&#39;. When my niece and nephew were born, their doctor advised them not to give their kids peanuts at all until they were some age, maybe 3 or 5 or so, in case they might be allergic. When their son, who is a somewhat picky eater anyway, claimed he didn&#39;t like peanut butter, they assumed that must mean he was allergic, like his dad, and they avoided having peanuts in their house at all until very recently, when a doctor confirmed he wasn&#39;t actually allergic at all. He&#39;s 7 or 8 now. My sister would squirrel away Peanut Butter Cap&#39;n Crunch cereal and eat peanut butter out of a jar with a spoon only when she was away from home and wasn&#39;t going to come in contact with her kids, who turned out to not have needed all that protection anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Katie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Speaking about radical unschooling at a homeschooling conference","postDate":"1504366662","msgId":78253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4NUVCNUZCLTIzMkYtNDNFNS04M0EyLTVEMzYwNjhGOTY0REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3REFCc2tTaWpPNzNHNU9TMDRjTE4xazJjR1dwM3VxUmUxZ0padm9QSF9SUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":78252,"nextInTopic":78254,"prevInTime":78252,"nextInTime":78254,"topicId":78219,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Knowing a number of children with that type of allergies, and seeing the different ways families deal with it, has made me curious as to whether the mom s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-619723305\">-=-<br/>\n Knowing a number of children with that type of allergies, and seeing the different ways families deal with it, has made me curious as to whether the mom&#39;s state of mind about it could actually pressure the child to develop symptoms more frequently.

How do you think about this from an unschooling perspective?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou already know the unschooling perspective, but consider the logical perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I both get headaches, and get cranky, if we miss protein for a couple of meals.  Keith, Marty and Kirby don’t.  The solution is to remember to get protein before too long. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are people who take that to such a level that they blame food for EVERYthing, and anything, and that’s not logical. It’s not sensible.  It’s an attempt at control, and magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic and control aren’t where learning come from.  And making claims to children that aren’t true is not where trust is built.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that people are used to parents controlling childrne’s diets to the point that they give them a plate of food they didn’t choose, and “make” them eat it all.  Some of you remember that from childhood. :-)  I hope few of you have tried to do that to your own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe term “the empty plate club” goes with that.  Talking’ about “glass half full” or glass half empty, “empty plate” is supposed to be the ideal, the success, but it sounds… empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s why I called my food page “The full plate club.”  A child with a full plate who is not forced to eat ANY of it will have more peace than a child forced to eat the perfect meal intended to cause him to be peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a video that’s funny, but that does capture the ideas kids internalize from hearing all of this.

And there ARE people making diet their religion.  I’m going to quote myself:<br/>\n<br/>\n____________<br/>\nAs with other magical sacrifices some people make to become &quot;good parents,&quot; some parents prohibit sugar. I&#39;ve seen very bad things come of that. And as magic, it doesn&#39;t work any better than the magical sacrifice of plastic toys, or of TV, or of video games, or of wearing clothes with logos on them. Those are lame attempts at magically assuring that a child will be peaceful or healthy or creative. What they tend more often to do is give children reason to be sneaky, and depending on the parental presentation or justification of the restrictions, can help the child learn early on that the parents aren&#39;t as bright as they would like.<br/>\n______________<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/idea\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/idea</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_zyDPBsRqaM?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":141733659,"authorName":"","from":"carolinelieber@...","profile":"carolinelieber","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Speaking about radical unschooling at a homeschooling conference","postDate":"1503842311","msgId":78229,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG9udWo0disxajVhdDRoQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZCRjFGNTEyLUJFRTQtNDU1Qi05Mzk2LTdCQUVDQkQzNkU5REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEI3OTZFRkE1LTI0NEItNENCRS1BQjk0LTNFMzJEMjg2NjhENEB5YWhvby5jb20uYXU+IDxFRkI2RENBMS1BODQ2LTQ5MEEtOERBNy01QjExNjNCMzcxMzlAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxDQUNNLTFZV2ZYaC1pVUdxX1BrdEJ6VW9fV1ZrdHR5dzFpdURiVlQ9YnNrSk1kalIwWFFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTw2QkYxRjUxMi1CRUU0LTQ1NUItOTM5Ni03QkFFQ0JEMzZFOURAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78226,"nextInTopic":78230,"prevInTime":78228,"nextInTime":78230,"topicId":78219,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much for your help preparing for the workshop.

We did it yesterday. There was really a lot of interest. 15 minutes was impossibly short but we did make a flyer as you suggested and collected contacts to work toward another dedicated gathering.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a lot of talk at the conference about food sensitivities affecting behaviour. It came up in the workshop too: that restlessness and difficulty concentrating (also anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) was a result of eating certain foods. I said that my kids know from experience how different foods make them feel and that they choose what they eat based on that. It didn&#39;t seem to be a sufficient answer... my youngest child is pretty bouncy and also sometimes anxious. I thought that was normal for a 7 year old.... or would she feel more relaxed and happy if she ate differently? How do you think about this from an unschooling perspective?<br/>\n<br/>\nCaroline</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Speaking about radical unschooling at a homeschooling conference","postDate":"1502936339","msgId":78226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZCRjFGNTEyLUJFRTQtNDU1Qi05Mzk2LTdCQUVDQkQzNkU5REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQ00tMVlXZlhoLWlVR3FfUGt0QnpVb19XVmt0dHl3MWl1RGJWVD1ic2tKTWRqUjBYUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEI3OTZFRkE1LTI0NEItNENCRS1BQjk0LTNFMzJEMjg2NjhENEB5YWhvby5jb20uYXU+IDxFRkI2RENBMS1BODQ2LTQ5MEEtOERBNy01QjExNjNCMzcxMzlAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxDQUNNLTFZV2ZYaC1pVUdxX1BrdEJ6VW9fV1ZrdHR5dzFpdURiVlQ9YnNrSk1kalIwWFFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78225,"nextInTopic":78229,"prevInTime":78225,"nextInTime":78227,"topicId":78219,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I think that quote is the epitome of unschooling and speaks volumes to what we are all choosing to do as parents. -=- Thank you!

You could maybe have a series of little exercises like that, where you leave out the discussion, but give people index cards and have them jot down things on themes like: trust, learning, school, not school, not learning, etc. And the presentation could be a brief discussion of how to use those cards yourself, later, to deepen your thinking about unschooling (based on the intro that you give). </div><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-11202290gmail_quote\"><div>On Wed, Aug 16, 2017 at 5:50 PM Sandra Dodd Sandra@...
