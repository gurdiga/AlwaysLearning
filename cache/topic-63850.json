We have friends who interact differently with their kids than we do, but my experience is that my kids focus on what they do like and don&#39;t spend much time on what they don&#39;t like.  There&#39;s even a positive kind of fascination they have with observing others and then talking about it/experimenting with it later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Example.

If so, I would take them aside and handle that, but sometimes things we label terrible are fascinating for kids.  Dmitri (6) was fascinated to see his friend Tom put in the corner.  He didn&#39;t feel bad about it, and Tom didn&#39;t seem to, either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDmitri did talk about it later, but he wasn&#39;t upset.  It was more like, &quot;Tom got put in the corner!&quot;  Wonder.  Fascination.  And from there we exchanged a couple of sentences on people doing things differently.  He wasn&#39;t interested in calling it wrong.  He talked about Tom being &quot;naughty&quot; in a kind of awestruck way, and I talked about some of the things Tom was doing that his mom was worried about.  We talked about how we&#39;re both like Tom (i.e., &quot;naughty&quot;) sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Example. Food limiting and all aspects of food eating including shaming of my children for bad etiquette. <br/>\nIts My mother...I have talked to her about this issue and others over steeping her boundary.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, we&#39;ve treated visits to others like entering a different culture.  We do our best to respect the culture when we&#39;re elsewhere, but there are instances when we do exercise our freedom.  When we eat dinner with our friends, they want their children to clear their plates before dessert.  Their daughter instructed Dmitri to clear his, and this caused real upset.  While I reassured Dmitri that he could do what felt good, the other mom reminded her daughter that we can decide what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a week or two, Dmitri internalized this rule, not consistently, but it kept coming up.  He&#39;d talk about waiting until later to eat certain foods.  He&#39;d decide what was dessert and what was dinner. He&#39;d express pride when he finished all of something.  He instructed his little sister about how to eat, and she blissfully ignored him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI supported his experiments and talked about food when he wanted to.  One of those times was when he wanted me to do what he was doing.  I just explained what felt best to me and why. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wore off,  but I think the experiment was functional for him because it led to conversations that helped him work through the upsetting part of it for him.  He also got to explore the satisfying part of his friend conveying This is What We Do and It Is Definitely the Right Thing.  He wanted to proclaim The Right Thing for a while, and then he was done.  He realized he had his own Right Thing, and that was trusting himself.  At the same time, he realized the other family had their own Right Thing that was parent-directed.  A co-existence of things called Right. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder what in particular your mother is doing around food?  Some things we&#39;re able to go along with pretty well at other people&#39;s houses (like trying to stay at the table while other people are still eating), while others call for our carving out a space for the kids.
