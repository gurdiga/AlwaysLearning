Would you  <br/>\nask us &quot;Do we continue to allow him to do his paper thing every day...?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe let our son play video games as much as he wanted to, from the time  <br/>\nhe was four or so and got his first Nintendo, til forever.  Birthday  <br/>\ngifts and Christmas gifts were games and new systems and controls.  He  <br/>\nstudied Nintendo Power Magazine, and bought indexes with his own  <br/>\nmoney, in those days before internet gaming sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he works for Blizzard, Entertainment. It wasn&#39;t precisely and  <br/>\nexactly because of his video game playing; much was that he lived in a  <br/>\ntown where they had a customer service contract.  But given what he&#39;s  <br/>\nnow doing as a living (and not a bad living), had we limited him, we  <br/>\nwould have been distracting him from preparing for his future.  The  <br/>\n&quot;trivia&quot; he knew about games and gaming now is solid knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your son will eventually get involved in creating flight  <br/>\nsimulation scenarios, or other flight-related things.  Let his  <br/>\ninterests vary; don&#39;t try to pinpoint him or &quot;talk about the future.&quot;   <br/>\nDon&#39;t expect him to know what he&#39;s going to do.

What&#39;s being recommended more than that is to relax,  <br/>\naccept him, be his helper and his partner.  His success is your  <br/>\nsuccess.  His happiness should be your happiness.  Find ways to enable  <br/>\nhim to be calm and happy, rather than ways to make him feel small and  <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to excursions with friends, though, I think you should definitely  <br/>\nprovide movie ticket costs and snacks and lunch afterwards and maybe  <br/>\ngas money if other kids are driving.   Rather than comparing it to  <br/>\nschool field trips or school fees, perhaps consider it ALL that school  <br/>\nwould cost.  Lunches, clothes, supplies, fees, PE uniforms, whatever  <br/>\nall, and consider that unschooling does and should cost at least that  <br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found that by being generous with our kids (who are now 18, 21 and  <br/>\n23) that they were eager to help us back, and to be generous with one  <br/>\nanother.

He wanted to stay in Albuquerque a few more days, to be  <br/>\nhome, and visit more calmly.   He gave Marty $200 cash as a birthday  <br/>\ngift.   I don&#39;t think that&#39;s common of 23 year olds and their younger  <br/>\nsiblings.  I could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way you live, the way you see him, the way you treat him, helps  <br/>\nhim have the chance to  become whole and strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to maturity, did either you or your husband &quot;mature late&quot;?  I  <br/>\nmatured early.  So did Kirby.  Keith didn&#39;t.  Neither did Marty.<br/>\nAs to men I still know who grew up with me, my schoolmates, some of  <br/>\nthose who matured early were stuck in a nearly false bravado.

Is that because <br/>\nyour family doesn&#39;t actually have enough income for him to do things he <br/>\nwants to do or is it because you have the idea that a &quot;normal&quot; 16 year <br/>\nold ought to be interested in earning his own money? If the latter, it <br/>\njust isn&#39;t true of all or even most 16 year olds.

I sense that you&#39;re not convinced of this, that you&#39;re worried <br/>\nthat he&#39;s doing too much &quot;staring at a screen&quot; (in quotes because so <br/>\nmany people have used that expression). Instead of worrying about it - <br/>\nlearn more about what he is really doing and support it. You&#39;re going to <br/>\nbe really thrilled when you realize how much complex thinking is <br/>\ninvolved and how much learning is going on.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He seems to totally reject any sort of conversation about the future.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let him BE now. Let him live in the present for another few years. It is <br/>\na sweet and wonderful gift that you can give him. I really DO understand <br/>\nthe worry that happens in the minds of parents of young men - it usually <br/>\nkicks in when the boy is 17 or so - close to 18 - and doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nhave any interest in becoming a &quot;responsible adult.&quot; But, I&#39;ve seen it <br/>\nhappen over and over - the parents start worrying a year or two too <br/>\nearly. The kid is sensing that and almost desperately hangs onto his <br/>\nchildhood and that worries the parents even more. It is very very <br/>\ncommon. From my observation, it all works out over the next few years - <br/>\nmaybe into the early 20&#39;s. If you can afford to give your kid an <br/>\nextended childhood, that is more time for him to heal from the hurt that <br/>\nwas done to him by bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He says to relatives and friends - when asked that he wants to be a pilot.

Or <br/>\nsomething related to flying or airplanes? He doesn&#39;t have to commit to a <br/>\ncareer in it to get a bit involved. Can you afford a few lessons?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour response seems odd, to me. If my kid expressed an interest in <br/>\nsomething like this, what I&#39;d do is try to find a way that we could <br/>\nafford to support that interest. We wouldn&#39;t jump totally into it - <br/>\nincur some huge expense - we&#39;d go easy, but we&#39;d do something to move in <br/>\nthat direction. Seems like, if I&#39;m understanding correctly, you&#39;re not <br/>\nonly not supporting his interest, you&#39;re discouraging it. First, you&#39;re <br/>\nsaying that it is very expensive and that he&#39;d have to work. Are you <br/>\nUSING this as an excuse to sort of nag him about how he&#39;s going to have <br/>\nto work? Second, you&#39;re saying that you don&#39;t think he means it. That <br/>\nMAY or may not be so, but if he&#39;s repeatedly saying it, I think you <br/>\nshould take him seriously at his word and offer something to support <br/>\nthat interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dh and I believe that in his true heart he doesn&#39;t really want to be a pilot but likes to say that he does in order to garner approval- people say &quot; wow thats a really exciting career...etc&quot;<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are zillions of other things he could have said, though, and he&#39;s <br/>\nsaying that. And he&#39;s playing with some kind of flight simulator. That <br/>\nis an indication of an interest in that general direction - so follow up <br/>\non that and support it. Maybe a tour of an air museum, maybe get some <br/>\nmovies about pilots, maybe take some short flights to somewhere or <br/>\nanother, maybe get him a chance to fly in a small plane --- I don&#39;t know <br/>\nenough to know what&#39;s possible, that&#39;s YOUR job as an unschooling parent.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess my question is do we continue to allow him to do his electronic thing every day - or should we intervene and try to encourage some more social behaviour- especially inside the family.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;His electronic thing?&quot; He&#39;s doing lots of things - it isn&#39;t one thing. <br/>\nDon&#39;t just &quot;allow&quot; it - join in and support it and enhance it and help <br/>\nhim revel in what he loves! Get him an online account so he can play <br/>\nwith other people all over the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s boyfriend has a sad story with a happy ending that he <br/>\ntells people who have your concerns. His parents restricted his video <br/>\ngame playing for years. He resented it a lot. Then, his dad suddenly got <br/>\ninterested in playing video games and they started playing together. It <br/>\nchanged their relationship completely - they became MUCH closer. Then <br/>\nhis mom and sister started playing, too, and he says his whole family <br/>\nbecame much much happier and closer and more loving with each other. If <br/>\nyou could hear him tell how much it meant to him for the rest of his <br/>\nfamily to get into this thing that HE loved so much, it would bring <br/>\ntears to your eyes. He is now 23 years old and he and his dad schedule <br/>\ntimes to play video games together and it is really really sweet. I <br/>\nreally honestly think, knowing him and his father, that they would have <br/>\nhad a lot of problems with each other over the years if they hadn&#39;t had <br/>\nthis really fun thing they did that brought them together.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

She intends to have a very <br/>\nlarge and complex website (think Webkinz 10G) connected to her doll lines. <br/>\nShe plans on having a doll museum and education center that will eventually <br/>\nbe part of a theme park built around her doll characters and stories. She <br/>\nintends also to publish novels and has devised a very cool online library <br/>\nconcept as part of her doll site.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have only just learnt that Otis College has a toy and doll design program <br/>\nthat is interesting to Jayn, but certainly not the only prospective path to <br/>\nher dreams. One of her heroes is Walt Disney who started as just a guy who <br/>\ndrew a mouse and look what he built.<br/>\n<br/>\nI support her today, even being in dire financial straights, by visiting toy <br/>\nand doll stores without the expectation of purchasing, looking at her <br/>\ndrawings and talking over design concepts, sewing with her, helping her find <br/>\nmore online info sources, typing her dictated stories for her, and keeping <br/>\ntrack of her ideas in notebooks.

She is more tuned into seeing him as an individual (which is usually not the case with labels, but has worked for her).  One of the things she observes about her son is that his timetable seems to be a little different, and she supports him having friends of different ages (usually younger) and doing things differently, because she knows that him at 15 is not going to look like many others at 15.  In that way, she&#39;s gotten rid of the significance of THAT label (the 15 year-old label).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m not suggesting you get him labeled (I&#39;m really not!), I am suggesting that you could use that information you have to benefit your son.  It&#39;s not actually a normal and accepted attitude amongst unschoolers that kids necessarily move out of the house and go to college at 18.
