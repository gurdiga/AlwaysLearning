My dh sounded alot like <br/>\nyours when ds was 10.  My *devil teacher* had been coming out alot to <br/>\ntyrannize, and ds, after much mutual soul-searching and a some mutual tears, <br/>\ninformed me that I was fired as his teacher.  (His exact words were [albeit <br/>\nsaid tenderly], &quot;I need a mother right now more than I need a teacher, and <br/>\nyou&#39;re just not very good at changing hats.&quot;  Out of the mouths of babes...)  <br/>\nWell, I wasn&#39;t about to let him get away with firing me -- ! -- so I quit the <br/>\njob.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter dh, who decided that *he* would take over, because after all, those <br/>\n3R&#39;s had to be mastered.  That lasted exactly 6 weeks.  (Dh got fired, too.)  <br/>\nAfter that, ds took over responsibility for his own education and unschooling <br/>\nbegan in earnest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he is concerned that they will need exams and must have the<br/>\n&gt;  ability to take exams and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A few things you might share with your husband:  Kids aready know how to <br/>\nlearn (they&#39;ve  been doing it all their lives).  Yes, my son did learn how to <br/>\ntake tests.  And yes, he did get into the college of his choice, where he is <br/>\nhappily following his interests.  It all works out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarge</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5562,"nextTopicId":5523}}
