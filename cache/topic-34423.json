Disney has finally confirmed they&#39;re offering free dining again<br/>\nduring the time we&#39;ll be there and we can start reserving the free dining<br/>\npackages now. I&#39;m trying to reach as many homeschoolers as possible so they<br/>\ncan take advantage of it before availability runs out. (They said that there<br/>\nwould be fewer packages this year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m located in South Carolina, but all homeschoolers are welcome to join us<br/>\non our trip. We&#39;re trying to get more older homeschoolers to join us this<br/>\nyear, if possible, so that we can reserve the higher level educational<br/>\nprograms (with more of a career and behind-the-scenes focus) in addition to<br/>\nthe elementary and middle school programs. We&#39;re not travel agents and don&#39;t<br/>\nmake a commission on rooms (as a matter of fact, all of our travelers choose<br/>\ntheir own hotels and reserve themselves). We just want the opportunity to<br/>\nenjoy more of the educational programs this year and need more older<br/>\nhomeschoolers to make the minimum for the programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur tickets will be heavily discounted, and will include theme parks, water<br/>\nparks, Disney Quest, and special educational programs. The free dining just<br/>\nmakes the deal even better!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, please visit<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdw.htm\">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdw.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo receive trip updates, join our Traveling Homeschoolers mailing list at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/lists.htm\">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/lists.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDianna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34421,"nextTopicId":34438}}
