I <br/>\nalways try to make sure that we talk about where we are going and in <br/>\nwhat order.  Usually this happens at home, and then periodically as <br/>\nneeded throughout our outings.  Definitely, we have done the <br/>\nchorelike places first when we can, although, sometimes the kids want <br/>\nto go to the toy store first, so that they can have something to play <br/>\nwith while we go somewhere else, so I&#39;m flexible on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I probably have an opportunity to do better is to talk to the <br/>\ngirls before we get started at any particular place, and to let them <br/>\nknow that if they can give me a little bit of warning before they <br/>\nfeel like they are done, that will help, because I do need the <br/>\ntransition time with their brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe positive with that approach, is that the girls will know that I <br/>\nam really recognizing their need to be done at some point and I think <br/>\nthat they will be willing to give me the warning, because it will <br/>\nbenefit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, I just came up with a new phrase, which is <br/>\nbased on the old game &quot;Don&#39;t Break the Ice.&quot;  Their cousin has the <br/>\nnewer version, which uses marbles on a wet kleenex.  Recently I said <br/>\nthat I was on my last marble about something to help explain it to <br/>\nthem, and they really got it.  I think that they might be able to use <br/>\nthat phrase themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, a big part of the solution is just more, earlier and <br/>\nbetter communication.  It helps me tremendously to hear other <br/>\nexamples and figure out how I can work that into our experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Honoring all needs in the moment","postDate":"1191794651","msgId":30992,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlYmw0citnM25lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZlOWxyaCt1c2k0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30982,"nextInTopic":30998,"prevInTime":30991,"nextInTime":30993,"topicId":30982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes, I have purposely done the less desirable task first and used the fun one as the last one.

It seems to work <br/>\npretty good.  I also like to keep distractors in my bag or purse or <br/>\npocket.  As soon as the younger child seems to be feeling the pull to <br/>\ngo back or stay and be upset about leaving, I pull something out of <br/>\nmy bag of tricks as a distractor.  I might even say that I have <br/>\nsomething cool out in the car, if there is actually something cool <br/>\nout in the car.  I try to keep hidden treasures out in the car for <br/>\nthose occasions.  Food is a good incentive to leave a store.

He is a delightfully <br/>\ncurious, into everything sort of 3.5, and is also now fully <br/>\nexpressing opinions about what he does and doesn&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we are running into more often than ever before, are situations, <br/>\nusually when out, where I&#39;ve tried to accomodate his need to meander <br/>\nand check things out, but the girls are getting to a point where they <br/>\nare done, and either need to go to the bathroom, need to just get <br/>\nhome, get in the car, whatever, and they are no longer interested in <br/>\nwaiting around for him.  I totally understand their perspective too, <br/>\nand try to make sure that we are accomodating their needs to <br/>\nsee/do/get also.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do also run into regular differences of opinion about what to do <br/>\nor not do in a particular day.  Usually in this case, it is more one <br/>\ndaughter wanting to go and one not, and my son has no problem going, <br/>\nit&#39;s when we&#39;re out and about that we run into the other issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this past week, we experienced this.  We had a few things we did <br/>\nin a neighborhood nearby, including visiting the toy store and then <br/>\ngetting tap shoes for my oldest daughter.  After we were pretty much <br/>\ndone, though, he wanted to go back again to the toy store, but the <br/>\ngirls were absolutely done, and needed to get to the car.  It was <br/>\nchallenging for a while, as he kept running back down the block from <br/>\nthe car to the toy store a few doors down, and the girls were not <br/>\nhappy about me leaving them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understood everyone&#39;s situation, empathasized with <br/>\neveryone, and felt like I really just tried to communicate <br/>\nunderstanding of their needs; however, in the end it just came down <br/>\nto a disagreement over what each wanted to do, and most usually it is <br/>\nthe toddler meander-ing-ness that creates the ultimate issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do talk a lot about what we&#39;re going to do when we&#39;re out, so that <br/>\neveryone has an idea of what will happen when (although, of course, <br/>\nliving in the moment, plans do change too).  I try to always make <br/>\nsure that I have food/drink, or make sure that we stop when <br/>\nnecessary, so that we can keep moods and energy levels up.  I also <br/>\ntry to make sure that we don&#39;t have more than about two stops if <br/>\nrunning errands, and give ourselves plenty of time if we are going <br/>\nsomewhere like a museum, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in the beginning, I think it&#39;s a phase, and really, in the <br/>\ngrand scheme, my children are pretty patient with each other most of <br/>\nthe time, but I know that I can always do better in helping them, so <br/>\nwould appreciate any communication ideas, trip planning thoughts, in <br/>\nthe moment success stories, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30980,"nextTopicId":30999}}
