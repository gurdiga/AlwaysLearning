We <br/>\njust had Zak and Max in an unschooling school for the past 8 months <br/>\nand hubby and I decided that paying $1300 a month for the kids to do <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve been doing at home didn&#39;t really make sense.  We are in <br/>\nthe process of moving from Tucson to the Denver/Boulder area of <br/>\nColorado in September and so decided it was time to get back on this <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill post more later.... Glad to be back to an environment that I <br/>\nhave found interesting, informative, friendly, thought provoking and <br/>\nchallenging any of my old assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to watch the kids clean out the guinea pigs.  Watching is what I <br/>\ndo a lot of now, rather than trying to tell them what to do or how <br/>\nto do it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19862,"nextTopicId":19860}}
