No<br/>\nreal effort if you are one of the 8. More than<br/>\nchallenging if you are one of the 2.  Can&#39;t confirm<br/>\nthat is accurate info. as research changes may have<br/>\nbeen updated in the last 15 years.  But maybe this is<br/>\nnot one they grow out of- but just a pre-determined<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can RRRRRRrrrrrrrrRRRRR from here to Sunday.  I am<br/>\nalso one of those children who had an attached tongue<br/>\nat the bottom.(I hate the term &quot;tongue tied&quot;; sounds<br/>\nlike you have a fear of speaking.)  That attached<br/>\ntongue is an inherited trait.  2 of my 4 children have<br/>\nit. When they were infants, my mother suggested that I<br/>\nshould &quot;just have them clipped&quot; as she had done with<br/>\nme @ 6 months.  At the family docs direction.  And,<br/>\n&quot;Look how well you speak.&quot;   Her fear did not convince<br/>\nme anymore than it had on other parenting issues she<br/>\ndisagreed with me on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, what do you know.  My 2 with the &quot;handicap&quot; are<br/>\nnow 6 and 10.  Neither had any real difficulties<br/>\npronouncing any sounds.  Their eccentricities of<br/>\nspeech lasted about as long as those of my 16 and 11<br/>\nyo&#39;s with the &quot;normal&quot; tongues.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if they can roll the RRRrrrrrrr&#39;s but,<br/>\naside from not being able to stick their tongues out<br/>\nto touch their noses, I don&#39;t see any permanent<br/>\ndisadvantage.  They did avoid the trauma of being cut<br/>\non in the mouth as an infant.  Which has to be a<br/>\npsychic plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also say that my 10 yo has mild to moderate<br/>\nhearing loss in both ears as a result of antibiotics<br/>\nhe was given as a preemie. (They quite commonly lead<br/>\nto nerve damage.) Yet, I had to Insist that our<br/>\nPediatrician give him a hearing test to diagnose the<br/>\nloss when he was 4. (The screenings done as an infant<br/>\nwere in a normal range.  It&#39;s harder to detect<br/>\nspecific tone deficiencies when they are younger.) I<br/>\nknew he was missing some sounds....   miss hearing<br/>\ncertain letters...  She was astounded when the results<br/>\ncame back confirming my suspicion.  Because- he speaks<br/>\nso well. Perfectly by her standards. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s the 3rd child.  I did nothing different with him.<br/>\n We just talk so damn much that I think it&#39;s a matter<br/>\nof practice, practice, practice around here. He was a<br/>\nhigh needs baby and toddler ... still is some days. <br/>\nSo, maybe all the Required attention did increase his<br/>\n&quot;talking lessons&quot;.  But mostly I think it&#39;s because we<br/>\nare a family of talkers.  Some families are Huge<br/>\nGo-ers, Readers, Doers, Athletes, etc........<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all talk.  A lot.  All the time.  I love when I<br/>\nhave time to myself because it is always noisy here<br/>\nfrom all the talking.  But, I do know that that is how<br/>\nmuch of the learning occurs in our family. Discussions<br/>\nof information.  Verbal analyzing.  Thoughtful debate.<br/>\nStory telling, Role playing, etc........<br/>\n<br/>\nI chalk up the lack of any sound attainment<br/>\ndifficulties to sheer VOLUME. Most of us are<br/>\nproficient at what we do the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as was previously noted, how many adults can&#39;t<br/>\nmake certain sounds?   Not too many. I think most kids<br/>\nlearn as they need to and develop strategies for<br/>\nthemselves that work for them in mastering language.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn TV:<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Lisa. And any others who still struggle with this<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been there/done that and figured it out-for us<br/>\nanyway- just an observation or 2.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**What if you REALLY didn&#39;t pay attention to the tv<br/>\nviewing.   What if it REALLY wasn&#39;t an issue for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say that you &quot;allow him complete access&quot; <br/>\nAnd that you have exhausted your creative abilities in<br/>\ntrying to offer him alternatives to tv viewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you just STOP trying to lure him away?  Can you<br/>\nforget about it as an issue?  Not count the tv time or<br/>\nthink of it as wasted? <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, while you may not be forcing him to turn it<br/>\noff, you are surely invested in trying to deter and<br/>\ndecrease his viewing.  And he knows it.  He knows by<br/>\nyour reaction when he does something else.  Your : )<br/>\ntells him.  He knows by the anxious looks you send him<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s zoned out for the 4th hour in a row.  He<br/>\nknows by the stress that has to be coming in loud and<br/>\nclear to him- as it&#39;s clear as crystal in your post. <br/>\nHe knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have this issue when we started to unschool.  I<br/>\nimagine we still would if I hadn&#39;t REALLY committed<br/>\nmyself to letting it go.  You might judge that we have<br/>\nit now if you came on a day when TV was what held<br/>\ntheir interest.  It&#39;s 101 degrees here today, same as<br/>\nyesterday.  TV is more enjoyable than anything outside<br/>\nright now.  But, it may be left off all day when we<br/>\nget down to outside play temps again. Or if they are<br/>\nmaking caves out of blankets or playing cards or.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMore likely, it gets turned on, looked at for a bit<br/>\nand then they wander off and go do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s clear to me that no one is watching, I&#39;ll flip<br/>\nit off.  Usually, I put in a cd when I do as the<br/>\nstereo is connected to the tv for better sound. I take<br/>\na turn with music.<br/>\n<br/>\nI NEVER make them turn off when they are watching.  If<br/>\nwe have an event scheduled or I want to do something<br/>\nbecause I want to do it, I will say... Time to go...<br/>\nand they leave it voluntarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know there will never again be a tv rationing so<br/>\nit&#39;s easy to leave when other things come up that<br/>\ninterest them. Like food.  Those who have been starved<br/>\nor whose food supply is threatened will eat in<br/>\nanticipation of the next period of want.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more consideration: I don&#39;t know what programs<br/>\nyour son has access to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in an area with digital, which took us from @<br/>\n60 channels to 250 with no additional cost. We now<br/>\nhave all the Discovery, History, TLC, .........<br/>\nmulti-Disneys,  all the really cool channels with<br/>\noodles and oodles of choices.  Mucho information and<br/>\ntopics of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have done an immense amount of learning as<br/>\na result of their viewing. They have developed a level<br/>\nof animal knowledge that far surpasses mine or their<br/>\ndads.  My middle son loves animals and has passed that<br/>\non to the other sibs through his heavy viewing of<br/>\nanimal programs.  Crocodile Hunter, Jeff Corwin,<br/>\nAnimal Planet shows.  Bill Nye and other kid friendly<br/>\nscience programs have spurred on their imaginations<br/>\nand interests.  Same for news programs, history<br/>\ntopics, etc...   <br/>\n<br/>\nTV has become the poster child for laziness. It is an<br/>\nerroneous correlation. There is just as much good<br/>\ninformation  and worthy topics of interest on TV as<br/>\ntheir are in books.  It is in a different form. It<br/>\ndoes require discretion of the viewer. But so do<br/>\nbooks. Many books are not worthy of the trees that<br/>\ndied for them.  Especially text books.  Can I say<br/>\n&quot;YAWN&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe seem, as a society, to be stuck in that &quot;back in<br/>\nthe good old days&quot; mind-set where tv is concerned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTV and the internet allow all of us a view of the<br/>\nworld that previous generations could not access.  I<br/>\ncan get a photo of virtually any place on the planet. <br/>\nI don&#39;t have to wonder what the favorite food of<br/>\nAussies is or how to raise a tadpole or what the<br/>\nweather is like in Bejing today.  Just go look it up. <br/>\nI think it&#39;s Exciting to live in this world we find<br/>\nourselves in.  The Possibilities are Limitless.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV can be a part of knowing the rest of the world.<br/>\nEven most cartoons have a specific world view, whether<br/>\nit&#39;s positive or not  ; )  ** What if, instead of<br/>\nmaking your disapproval a standing known entity, you<br/>\nasked him what his Favorite show is an made a date to<br/>\nwatch it with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake his favorite snack.  Talk about it during<br/>\ncommercials.  What was funny?   What did you like, not<br/>\nlike, Why are the characters so _______ whatever they<br/>\nare?  What do you think they like to eat, do with<br/>\ntheir parents, etc.............  Support his interest.<br/>\n Let him know that it really is OK with you that he<br/>\nlikes what interests him.  Even if it is TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, just leave it alone.  Let it be.  Do your thing.<br/>\n Do the family things and make no judgments on how<br/>\nmuch or what.  Maybe suggest other shows that he might<br/>\nlike based on his other interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have access to a multitude of channels,<br/>\ncheck your library.  We went through several series of<br/>\nanimal and science tapes the kids picked out. And all<br/>\nthe old favorites I had as a kid. Classics like &quot;Where<br/>\nthe Wild Things Are&quot;, &quot;Mike Mulligan&quot;, that donut shop<br/>\none where the machine gets stuck, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it sounds more like a power struggle than a TV<br/>\nproblem.  If the same conditions were applied to<br/>\nanother activity, you&#39;d likely end up with the same<br/>\nresult.  He won&#39;t need to hang on to the constant<br/>\nviewing if he doesn&#39;t feel that you are Hoping he will<br/>\ndo something else. He will likely ease up when you do<br/>\n.......  Or maybe he will be the next Larry King or<br/>\nTom Brokaw.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:*)<br/>\nMelinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
