So, we get to park day and she says <br/>\n&quot;mom, I forgot my shoes.&quot;  Well, you can&#39;t go into a hospital, store, <br/>\netc without shoes.  Well, we borrowed a pair froma friend who had an <br/>\nextra in the car, but this sorta thing happens often.  Shoes are not a <br/>\npriority. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my kids got old enough, it wasn&#39;t really my job to remind them <br/>\nabout shoes, jackets, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the one time that made me really mad was when I gave the <br/>\ngirls a packing list for the mountains, in fall, and on the way there my <br/>\n9 year old says &quot;oh, mom, I forgot to pack a jacket.  I hate walmart but <br/>\nit was the only t hing open. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;ve forgotten things too, so I couldn&#39;t be too mad. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nEstella Schmelter wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So then I should have just said OK and took his shoes<br/>\n&gt; and let him decide that he wanted to put the shoes on?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Estella<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:Sandra%40SandraDodd.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-The only reason I said that about Nanas house is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is only about 40 degrees here and really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think it is a good idea that he plays outside<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shoes since it is so cold.-=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s different from &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While it can be irritating to paraphrase other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people, it can be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great thinking tool to paraphrase ourselves.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Marty asked me, when he was little, &quot;When people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; count to infinity,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that illegal?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Someone said &quot;You can&#39;t count to infinity,&quot; and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was thinking about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If someone tells a child &quot;You can&#39;t go barefooted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when it&#39;s 40<br/>\n&gt; &gt; degrees,&quot; he&#39;s going to think about that, but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might not be the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best thoughts.
