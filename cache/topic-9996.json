So forgive me if I presume to ask you if you&#39;ve read any of Alice<br/>\nMiller&#39;s work? She has quite a few books out and also there is quite a bit by<br/>\nher over at www.naturalchild.com. In my experience &quot;Normal&quot; psychological<br/>\neducational training doesn&#39;t really unveil the ways that we disrespect<br/>\nchildren in our culture from birth on. Reading Alice Miller helped me to<br/>\nunderstand whole sections of my life where I didn&#39;t get the kinds of things<br/>\nthat all humans need. At times with my own children, especially when they hit<br/>\nan age at which *I* had difficulty as a child, it was if I was blocked in<br/>\ndealing with them. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but her words can be so<br/>\nhealing. They freed me from thinking I had to protect, in my mind, people who<br/>\nwhile trying their best still did me harm. That allowed me to both accept the<br/>\npain and the harm and move on and get beyond it in ways that &quot;understanding<br/>\nand forgiving&quot; hadn&#39;t let me. If that makes any sense? This in turn allowed me<br/>\nto be more generous and less demanding of my own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone with a strong background in psychology you might find _The Drama of<br/>\nthe Gifted Child_ (gifted in this case means sensitive and aware) particularly<br/>\ninteresting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find the whole subject fascinating. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","profile":"heidi_wd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I could really use some help","postDate":"1035842847","msgId":10005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjEwMjgxMzUwMTEuMDFlZjEwMDhAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWMyN2ViMCQwN2RhODMyMCQyNjgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzU4MDIwNzMuMjQzLjgzNzQ4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10003,"nextInTopic":10009,"prevInTime":10004,"nextInTime":10006,"topicId":9996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Julie, Let me get this straight, you ve got 5 kids, three under 6 and sometimes you lose it.
