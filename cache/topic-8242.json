It might get her to thinking.  It might <br/>\nget her to writing some songs.  It  might get her to lighten up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if she says she does own some songs, maybe make a list of all the songs in <br/>\nthe world (you can finish it later, but at least start it) and as if it&#39;s a <br/>\nserious proposition, make a list of the songs SHE owns, but she&#39;ll need to <br/>\ndesignate some to be her brother&#39;s songs.  And when she sees how silly and <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; it is, she&#39;ll laugh and give up the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Maybe &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I really want her to see the results of her actions.

I said I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know why he thought it was okay to be mean to Marty.  That people were <br/>\n nice to him (and I rattled off ten names of other kids and mostly adults who <br/>\nwere nice to him) and that he KNOWS it feels better, but he didn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nrealize how much he was hurting Marty with his attitude and his words.  I <br/>\nsaid I was frustrated that I couldn&#39;t figure out how to explain it to him, <br/>\nand embarrassed that he was being a way that he himself hadn&#39;t been treated, <br/>\nand I asked him what he would do if he were me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings started to change after that.  He just thought about it differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about role playing?  Trade places and be each other.  Let each of them <br/>\ntake turns being the mom.  Be them with an obnoxious vengeance.  If they get <br/>\nmad and say &quot;THAT IS NOT HOW I ACT.&quot; say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  How should I say it?&quot;  <br/>\nAnd maybe they&#39;ll do the &quot;new improved&quot; them.  And in doing that they&#39;ll <br/>\nthink about how it looks to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if a role playing session turns to tears and storming out, let it go.  <br/>\nPut on some quiet music, work in the yard, let all that frustration dissipate <br/>\ngradually and let it do some good.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Basically, she is frustrated alot of the time because things do not go her<br/>\nway. She needs to learn a few coping skills. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes breathing help?  Running? <br/>\nWhat if she&#39;s required to run around the outside of the house (if you have a <br/>\ncircuit outside) before she can yell at anyone?  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other day Kirby hit Holly.  He&#39;s fifteen.  She&#39;s ten.  He hit her in <br/>\nthe head because she was picking scabs off the cat and didn&#39;t quit when he <br/>\ntold her to.  We had company.  You can imagine my joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pulled the ancient and honorable rule we used when he and Marty were <br/>\nlittle.  You can only hit IF you talked first and then got a grownup to help. <br/>\n So here I am talking to someone physically bigger than I am, saying &quot;Did you <br/>\nask a grownup to help?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then you shouldn&#39;t have hit her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes such rules are more for the thinking-effect than for the procedure, <br/>\nfor sure.   But a running around the building &quot;rule&quot; would be a way for her <br/>\nto breathe and release adrenaline and have time to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the cat--I did point out to Kirby that if a cat does NOT want its scabs <br/>\npicked, no ten year old girl can do it.  It takes two adults and a towel.   <br/>\nMy husband and I learned that when we had a cat with an abscess on its head.  <br/>\nYes, you can pick a cat&#39;s scab against its will, but first wrap it in a <br/>\ntowel, lay on it with your arm over its paws (which are wrapped in more than <br/>\none layer of towel) and hold its skull while the other adult does the deed <br/>\nquickly. &lt;g&gt;  If Holly was picking Flower&#39;s scabs, Flower was into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117956499,"authorName":"maryfhickman@jps.net","from":"&lt;maryfhickman@...&gt;","profile":"mfhickman95616","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Family Life","postDate":"1028129624","msgId":8242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNwcmluZ21haWwuMDk5NC4xMDI4MTI5NjI0LjAuOTU5Mjk4MDBAd2VibWFpbC5wYXMuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8245,"prevInTime":8241,"nextInTime":8243,"topicId":8242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, You brought up some interesting ideas.

She has her own<br/>\nspace, a whole room, yet our house is tiny. She does have a brother who does<br/>\nnot respect her things mostly. He&#39;s getting better. He is obnoxiuos,<br/>\nespecially when friends are over. She has had to share me twice now with a new<br/>\nbaby. She stays up super late waiting for me to cuddle her in bed. Tessa still<br/>\nnurses at night and I get her asleep before I can visit with Ashley. Some<br/>\nnights I&#39;m proactive and get Ashley to settle in with some stories/chats<br/>\nbefore I help the others to bed. I&#39;m exhausted mostly meeting 3 kids needs all<br/>\nday and night. Tim leaves for work early in am and ar 40 can not stay awake<br/>\npast 9:30. We have issues about bedtime/let them go to bed on their own.<br/>\nTotally off on a tangent now.<br/>\n<br/>\nO.K. So I know Ashley is needy. Her neediness is going on and on and on,<br/>\nthough. We give her a ton of time with other families, teens, friends,<br/>\nactivities. She is a do-er. She does not repect us in that she barks when we<br/>\ntalk to her. She cries if she has to compromise. She sees herself at the hub<br/>\nof the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\n Riley likes to sing the songs she learns for musical shows. He does not want<br/>\nto be in the shows, yet loves watching and learning along side. Forever now,<br/>\nhe sings his own versions, she barks corrections at him, we ask her to let her<br/>\nbrother sing his style. If he wants help he will ask. She complains, cries,<br/>\nhums rudely and loudly so he messes up. He screams, she continues correcting.<br/>\nSo she is possessing even songs. She does not want to share them. It makes for<br/>\nmisearble driving and family time. Why can&#39;t she just let him be? Even after<br/>\nbeing asked to let him be?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really want her to see the results of her actions. When you correct Riley he<br/>\nyells at you. I need to help Riley not yell and Ashley not correct. The<br/>\nyelling would stop, though, if the correcting stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding her an adult/teen who she can learn respect from seems like a great<br/>\nidea. She has a good friend here on the block. I&#39;m at the point now of asking<br/>\nher to show some self control. She seems to be taking this rude behavior too<br/>\nfar and I want her to practice being kind. Feel what it feels like to speak<br/>\nkindly. We talked too much yesterday about finding solutions. She melted down<br/>\nevery 5 minutes or so. I would drop it. Wait until she was ready to talk<br/>\npeacefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n Basically, she is frustrated alot of the time because things do not go her<br/>\nway. She needs to learn a few coping skills. She wants me to send her to her<br/>\nroom to read when she gets cold and prickly. I want her to vent her<br/>\nfrustrations, on paper, to me, to the kittens, to someone so she can see/hear<br/>\nwhat&#39;s really going on. Often times the issue is really easily solved.<br/>\n<br/>\n Talk about sensivity to clothing. She has worn 1 pair of satin PJ bottoms<br/>\ninside out for 5 months now. And a bathing suit for underclothes. Once in a<br/>\nwhile she pulls on a tank dress. She found 2 pairs of sandals she loves, yea<br/>\nwe have shoes for now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really want her to see the results of her actions. When you correct Riley he<br/>\nyells at you. I need to help Riley not yell and Ashley not correct. The<br/>\nyelling would stop, though, if the correcting stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK enough, thank you for raeding. I&#39;m going to remember what a LLL leader<br/>\nfriend always said &quot;When they are the most unloveable, they need the most<br/>\nlove.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary (Who is festering in the small stuff)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8150,"nextTopicId":8300}}
