There was very little description there<br/>\nthat seemed any different from any regular Joe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is a big difference, and that&#39;s where using that aspie label CAN<br/>\nbe useful. His experience probably is different from yours. I can say that<br/>\nthere is a difference between my dh&#39;s tolerances and approximately 98% of<br/>\nthe hundreds (maybe thousands?) of people that I know. His responses to the<br/>\nworld are in a very small percentage of my known reality of many people over<br/>\nmany years. So the description above FOR HIM looks more intense than most<br/>\nother people I&#39;ve spent lots of time with. Having been on the planet for<br/>\nover 41 years, that&#39;s enough people, in my opinion to make this distinction.<br/>\nAnd using that term &quot;Aspie&quot;, for me, helps to say &quot;It&#39;s much more intense<br/>\nthan the majority of people in the world&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci I want to thank you for taking the time to give great detail to the<br/>\nactual experience of an autistic person. It was very well written and<br/>\naccurate to what I hear from my two guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23845,"nextTopicId":23858}}
