He is gradually upgrading and adding to his gaming collection.  When we could not provide the DS he wanted when he wanted, he used his savings to buy one on Ebay.  He set his own budget,and dictated the bids.  I helped, but it was his project.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new game or system will often send him to his room for hours each day, as he works his way through the game.  When he emerges with tales of his progress, it&#39;s often accompanied by questions like, &#39;if you could control the world, what would you do first? second? Third? fourth?&quot;  It&#39;s clear to see that the gaming is opening him up to bigger concepts and philosophies.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that the learning at your house is no less breathtaking - you just aren&#39;t used to looking at it without &quot;there needs to be some learning happening here, and I need to see it and think it&#39;s important for it to count.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s passionate about gaming, she&#39;s learning plenty about her world! <br/>\n<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE UNFETTERED LIFE<br/>\nwww.memismommy.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robyn L.

My girls love playing on the computer but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1661737772\">I have heard alot of games mentioned here. I was wondering if anyone <br/>\nhad any other favorites that they could share. My girls love playing <br/>\non the computer but we don&#39;t have alot of games. We do have a few <br/>\nwebsites we like but I would like to find some games we can buy for <br/>\nmore variety. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working on letting go of the reigns, too. I was raised in a home <br/>\nwhere I couldn&#39;t go to the bathroom without informing someone of <br/>\nwhere I would be.(This is not an exaggeration.) So control is <br/>\nsomething that I find myself unwillingly attached to. I know that I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting there though because my family doesn&#39;t understand how I <br/>\ninteract with my children. LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have only recently learned about Whole Life Unschooling. I have <br/>\ntried to control my children and I&#39;m so glad that they have never <br/>\nbeen as submissive as I was at their age. My husband thinks I&#39;m going <br/>\nto far but I think that time will show him other wise. I can already <br/>\nsee a change in my relationship with my girls. We talk not fuss. And <br/>\nwhen they try to fuss at me I stay so calm and unaffected that they <br/>\nquickly follow suit. You can&#39;t fight with someone that&#39;s not fighting <br/>\nand you don&#39;t want to fight once you know that you can be heard <br/>\nwithout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I went from one thing to another here. Thanks for listening. <br/>\nI&#39;m going to go play now.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48320,"nextTopicId":48322}}
