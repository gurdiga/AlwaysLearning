I&#39;m really excited about the opportunity to exchange ideas and to gain feedback about natural learning and parenting.  I live in Murfreesboro, TN.  My children are Hunter, 5.5, Ronin, nearly 4, and Drayken, 7.5 months.  I&#39;m married to Michael who is a swordfighting and fencing instructor.  We run a small raw vegan chocolate business and are very passionate about health and nutrition.  We are not vegans but we prefer to eat dairy free and sugar free.  I run a non-profit organization called Artsy Mamas and I love to blog at www.bonafidemama.com.  You are welcome to go there and friend me on facebook.  Can&#39;t wait to get to know all of you amazing moms and dads.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48269,"nextTopicId":48320}}
