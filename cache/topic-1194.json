When my daughter was about 3 she<br/>\nwas on a tremendous amount<br/>\nof medication and hormone therapies and one of the side<br/>\neffects was the tendency to fly into a <br/>\nrage.  She had temper tantrums that would bring down the<br/>\nhouse!  But I made it clear to her that<br/>\nthat sort of behavior wasn&#39;t acceptable. Period.  If we<br/>\nwere in a store and she made a scene about <br/>\nsomething she wanted she learned that when I said No I<br/>\nmeant No and if she didn&#39;t quiet down and behave not only<br/>\ndid I  not get her what she had begged for I put EVERYTHING<br/>\nback.  I wasn&#39;t hard or soft on her.  I was honest and firm<br/>\nand constant with her.  There are boundaries to the way we<br/>\ndeal and interact with others  and a correct time and place<br/>\nfor a good many things.  I taught her <br/>\nthat politeness and courtesy and respect were modes of<br/>\nbehavior that I expected from myself and from her all the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Mon, 10 Dec 2001 14:46:39 EST<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Shopping/money...<br/>\n&gt;Gosh - I honestly think &quot;because you&#39;re disturbing others&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>often is the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;real <br/>\n&gt;reason that  they should stop and it often is a good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reason (not always,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but <br/>\n&gt;often) and that, as kids get older, parents owe it to them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to help them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;see <br/>\n&gt;how their behavior is impinging on others.
