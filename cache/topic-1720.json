Both of these friends I met and befriended entirely <br/>\nonline, via email and various instant messenger services. However, as of <br/>\nabout a year or so ago, we began faxing one another letters so that we could <br/>\ndoodle in the margins and see each others handwriting. It was fun - <br/>\nespecially as I&#39;d never used the fax machine before, and had previously had <br/>\nno idea how it worked. After a few letters via the fax machine, we started <br/>\nsending one another letters through the post, which was even nicer. I really <br/>\nlike the handwriting of both of my friends, and I like being able to write to <br/>\nthem even when I can&#39;t get online (usually because someone else is using the <br/>\ncomputer). <br/>\n<br/>\nSending and receiving handwritten letters is fun, even if my writing is <br/>\npretty illegible, unless I put a conscious effort into it. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Roxana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have friends I&#39;ve known since fourth grade and we all still write<br/>\n&gt; letters.

But I&#39;m never happy to know someone&#39;s a lefty.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not rational, it&#39;s just a bristly suspicion of darkest evil on my part.  <br/>\nIt passes.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really fully like to see people write or throw things with their left <br/>\nhands.
