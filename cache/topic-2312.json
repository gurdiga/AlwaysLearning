From<br/>\n&quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&quot; by Shunryu Suzuki.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ancient painters used to practice putting dots on paper in artistic<br/>\ndisorder.  This is rather difficult.  Even though you try to do it, usually<br/>\nwhat you do is arranged in some order.  You think you can control it, but<br/>\nyou cannot; it is almost impossible to arrange your dots out of order.  It<br/>\nis the same with taking care of your everyday life.  Even though you try to<br/>\nput people under some control, it is impossible.  You cannot do it.  The<br/>\nbest way to control people is to encourage them to be mischievous.  Then<br/>\nthey will be in control in its wider sense.  To give your sheep or cow a<br/>\nlarge, spacious meadow is the way to control them.  So it is with people:<br/>\nfirst let them do what they want and watch them.  This the best policy.  To<br/>\nignore them is not good; that is the worst policy.  The second worst is<br/>\ntrying to control them.  The best one is to watch them, just to watch them,<br/>\nwithout trying to control them....The true purpose is to see things as they<br/>\nare, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2295,"nextTopicId":2316}}
