I said birds weren&#39;t mammals.  (So <br/>\nI didn&#39;t want them on my list &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I told her &quot;herb&quot; was plant, &quot;vore&quot; had to do with eating, and when <br/>\npeople were REALLY hungry they were voracious.  Carne, I said &quot;like chile con <br/>\ncarne, &#39;with meat&#39;&quot; (and I could have said lots more but didn&#39;t).  &quot;Omni&quot; I <br/>\nsaid &quot;omnimax, omnibus, omnipresent&quot; and then I wrote down vegetarian and <br/>\nsaid when it&#39;s a choice for moral, religious or health reasons they say <br/>\nthey&#39;re vegetarian, not that they&#39;re herbivorous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was all done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have done that for anyone new to the language.
