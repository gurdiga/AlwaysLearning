I was trying to figure out how to explain some of <br/>\nthis but couldn’t think of a way. Instead, I went and found some links about <br/>\nmorals and ethics. There are so many things in your statement above that <br/>\nlead to confusion and questions. It would venture into meta-discussions. For <br/>\nexample, what do you mean by harm? Some people do things that are harmful <br/>\nbecause they see harming as good. If a person follows a completely different <br/>\nmoral code than you, there probably isn’t much point in having a discussion <br/>\nunless terms and ideas are defined at the outset. You have given spanking as <br/>\nan example of something that is wrong no matter what. I would hope that most <br/>\npeople that practice unschooling either don’t spank or are trying to stop <br/>\nspanking. For those that follow a different set of standards, not spanking <br/>\nis seen as harmful and it doesn’t matter if it is physical violence. The end <br/>\njustifies the mean.<br/>\nI found this really cool article about chiropractic ethics (it’s a bit weird <br/>\nthat I stumbled upon it considering that my husband teaches ethics at a <br/>\nchiropractic college). Here is the link: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=46121\">http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=46121</a><br/>\nIt mentions a lot of the things that have been discussed here. I have copied <br/>\nand pasted most of the article:<br/>\nEthics comes from the Greek word ethos - moral character or custom. Morality <br/>\ncomes from the Latin word moralis - custom or manner. The words both deal <br/>\nwith the customs or the manner in which people do things. Their modern <br/>\nmeanings relate to the way people act - either good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorality, strictly speaking, is used to refer to what we would call moral <br/>\nconduct or standards. Morality is looking at how good or bad our conduct is, <br/>\nand our standards about conduct. Ethics is used to refer to the formal study <br/>\nof those standards or conduct. Sometimes, one refers to the study of conduct <br/>\nas moral philosophy, but that is less common than just saying &quot;ethics.&quot; <br/>\nHence, in most chiropractic colleges, there is an ethics class, rather than <br/>\none named &quot;morality.&quot; One might say that morality is ethics in action, but <br/>\nin the end, the two terms can be used interchangeably. The study of ethics <br/>\nor moral philosophy can be divided into three broad areas: descriptive, <br/>\nnormative and analytical (or metaethics).<br/>\n<br/>\nDescriptive ethics is simply describing how people behave. For example, <br/>\npeople might say that they think that stealing is bad, but descriptive <br/>\nethics might tell us, from observing these people, that they may have <br/>\n&quot;downloaded&quot; hundreds of media (in such forms as .mp3 audio or .bmp image) <br/>\nfiles from file-sharing programs on the Internet. Descriptive ethics let us <br/>\nsee if we &quot;walk the walk,&quot; and if we are just rationalizing our way past our <br/>\nown moral beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it takes an unbiased observer to point out to us where we are not <br/>\nmeeting our own standards. For some, discovering the hypocrisy might just <br/>\nget us to change what we say is good or bad, and adopt and lessen our <br/>\nprofessed moral code to fit our actions. Hopefully, descriptive ethics can <br/>\nlead to some moral self-reflection and an improvement in our own behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormative ethics tries to establish norms or typical appropriate behaviors <br/>\npeople should perform. In ethics class, I call these the &quot;shoulda,&#39; gotta,&#39; <br/>\nneeda,&#39; hafta&#39; do&quot; things. One should be honest; in the language of ethics, <br/>\nthis is called &quot;veracity.&quot; We know that as health care providers, we should <br/>\nstrive to help our patients; this is called beneficence. &quot;Above all, do no <br/>\nharm&quot; (or, as Hippocrates wrote: &quot;primum non nocere&quot;) is called <br/>\n&quot;nonmaleficence&quot; in ethics (not &quot;nonmalfeasance&quot;). Fairness, or justice, is <br/>\nanother norm. Gratitude and reparations are often mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMetaethics often looks at how people determine for themselves what norms to <br/>\nfollow. I think all parents would agree with me that they have a significant <br/>\nimpact on what their children grow up to believe are right and wrong <br/>\nactions. There are many other sources of people&#39;s personal ethical beliefs. <br/>\nGenerally, we learn good behaviors from our teachers and our religions. In <br/>\nfact, despite all the strife due to religions, the commonality is that they <br/>\nteach norms. The Ten Commandments, for example, is basically a list of <br/>\nnorms. For better, or often, for worse, our ethics are also influenced by <br/>\nour peers, and our culture, as seen through the media. Lastly, we have the <br/>\nability to make changes though moral self-reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat roles do guilt and fear play in ethics? They are the two great <br/>\nguardians of the &quot;straight and narrow.&quot; Some maintain their conduct within <br/>\naccepted ethical norms because of the fear of getting caught. These people <br/>\noften do whatever they think that they can &quot;get away with.&quot; If they know <br/>\nthey are not being watched and are unlikely to get caught, they will violate <br/>\nalmost any ethical norm. Of course, if they are a bit paranoid or &quot;chicken,&quot; <br/>\nthey will not stray, as they are not prepared to follow the criminal&#39;s <br/>\ndictum: &quot;Don&#39;t do the crime if you can&#39;t do the time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuilt, on the other hand, is the motivator of honest people. Their decision <br/>\nto comply with ethical norms is not based on whether they will get caught, <br/>\nbut because they will know that they did something they think is wrong. <br/>\nSociopaths do not feel guilt because they do not believe their actions are <br/>\nwrong. Ultimately, those who feel guilt as children decide to be &quot;good&quot; <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t want to feel guilty again. As they get older, being good <br/>\nbecomes a habit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(I am putting this out there because looking at things from a more <br/>\nphilosophical perspective really helped me in my journey to becoming a more <br/>\nthoughtful person. For some, it might be too complicated. For me, it is <br/>\nprecisely what I needed to see the bigger picture. The type of decision <br/>\nmaking that is being discussed in relation to radical unschooling has been <br/>\naround for centuries.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;the right way&quot;","postDate":"1346255586","msgId":68831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsxbGR0MitmbmFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWNkODUxYiQ3MjE2MDdiMCQ1NjQyMTcxMCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":68830,"nextInTopic":68832,"prevInTime":68830,"nextInTime":68832,"topicId":68804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"== The words right and wrong are so judgment laden that they are about as useful as Good and Bad.== == There is no right way, there is just YOUR WAY,== I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1410876581\">== The words right and wrong are so judgment laden that they are about as useful as Good and Bad.==<br/>\n<br/>\n== There is no &quot;right way,&quot; there is just YOUR WAY,==<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is true when you are talking about morals but not with actions.

(My mom has a tendency to have <br/>\ndisasters and feel bad about stuff as a way to get attention and pats on the <br/>\nback. She doesn’t really have a desire to do better.

If one person is going to Albuquerque <br/>\nand the other is going to New York, it wouldn’t be very helpful to discuss <br/>\nthe specifics such as where to turn and what streets to use. There might be <br/>\nsome things in common such as how to calculate gas mileage but the <br/>\nindividual streets to be traveled will be very different. If you are having <br/>\na discussion without knowing that the two of you have very different <br/>\ndestinations, then there will be times that nothing makes sense. It will be <br/>\nlike trying to have a conversation in two different languages. If I know <br/>\nthat somebody has a very different destination than me, I don’t feel guilty <br/>\nfor being different. If something Sandra or Meredith or Joyce or Brie, etc. <br/>\nsays makes me feel guilty, then I am going to think long and hard about why <br/>\nwhat they said made me feel that way and I am damn sure going to try to do <br/>\nbetter. One of the things that I don’t think has been mentioned yet in this <br/>\nthread is checks and balances. I sometimes feel like moms want to do <br/>\nwhatever they want without ever feeling bad and without every having their <br/>\nparenting checked. I use feelings of guilt to check myself. I also make sure <br/>\nthat our house is one where my husband and children can and will say <br/>\nsomething if I get too far afield. Even my mom will sometimes say something <br/>\nif she notices me being particularly crabby. I don’t see that as them trying <br/>\nto make me feel bad about my choices. I see it as them trying to help me and <br/>\nkeep me on track. It is a system of checks and balances that keeps me from <br/>\nbecoming the sole voice in the family. I do not want to be the one that <br/>\nmakes all of the decisions and tells everybody else what to do and how to do <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;the right way&quot;","postDate":"1346250018","msgId":68827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ1N0I1MEE3QUMxMTQ1NzJCQUE4MUQ3NzVFRjFCMUFBQExhcHB5SFA+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWNkODU4YSRjZGE4OTE1MCQ2OGY5YjNmMCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEQ2QkIwQ0RELUM4NUYtNEI0Qi1CRkQzLURCMDgzNUVEOUEyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAwMTgwMWNkODUxYiQ3MjE2MDdiMCQ1NjQyMTcxMCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4gPDk0MjVFRUEyLTFBQkEtNDAxRi1BNzEyLUI5RkExQjYzNEEyNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAwMzkwMWNkODU4YSRjZGE4OTE1MCQ2OGY5YjNmMCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":68826,"nextInTopic":68828,"prevInTime":68826,"nextInTime":68828,"topicId":68804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe it will and maybe it won’t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In most parenting discussions, guilt is a dominate participant <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because people are always telling others what they should do, as if <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there is a &quot;right way,&quot; making people feel less than because they <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aren&#39;t living up to some more perfect ideal. I&#39;m not sure how any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of it is helpful, as most of us know that what works for one kid <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;may not work for another. It&#39;s hit and miss a lot of the time. It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;also not helpful because my ideal isn&#39;t necessarily <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yours.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the really interesting things that have happened to me since I have <br/>\nbecome more thoughtful and more mindful is that I don’t really have people <br/>\ntelling me what to do any more. At one time, my mother in law and I did not <br/>\nget along. I felt like she was telling me what to do and it was very much <br/>\nwhat is being described here. As I started trying to see things from other <br/>\npeople’s perspectives, I became more understanding and more compassionate. I <br/>\nalso became more confident in myself. I spent an hour and a half on the <br/>\nphone with my mother in law yesterday and she didn’t once tell me what to do <br/>\nnor did she question my parenting. Actually, she was very encouraging and <br/>\ncomplementary to me and our girls. That is a very different picture than the <br/>\nway things were five years ago. Five years ago, we were in a power struggle <br/>\nover being right. When I let go of that and started really trying to see <br/>\nthings from her perspective, I changed and so did our relationship. A lot of <br/>\ntimes, people are saying things based on what they observe. If somebody <br/>\nobserves a family where the children are jerks and the mom is tired and <br/>\nfrazzled, then that seems like a situation where other people are going to <br/>\nsee an opportunity to “educate” you. When my oldest was a toddler, I had <br/>\nsomebody sit me down and give me a “lesson” on child discipline. I smiled <br/>\nand nodded and then went on my way. I pretty much ignored it because I knew <br/>\nthat her goal and my goal were very, very different. If I hadn’t known that <br/>\nwe wanted very different things for our children, I might have been tempted <br/>\nto feel bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of things being hit and miss seems like an excuse to do things <br/>\nwilly nilly. I think I understand what you are saying but it can lead to <br/>\nlots of confusion. I do think there is a right way and that right way <br/>\nfocuses on the process rather than a single product. I have been reading, <br/>\nthinking, and writing about making ethical decisions and I think it is a <br/>\ngood model to follow because it focuses on the process rather than the <br/>\noutcome. The process of making an ethical decision has a built in evaluation <br/>\nmechanism so that you can think, evaluate, and adjust if a decision turns <br/>\nout to be bad or have unintended consequences. Even if your ideal isn’t the <br/>\nsame as mine, there are some things that I think are universal.

It is society in our heads. It isn&#39;t me owning what<br/>\nI did, it&#39;s me feeling bad because I&#39;ve been trained to feel bad. Supposedly<br/>\nthis feeling bad equates into ownership.

Guilt<br/>\nseems like hatred turned inward, a denial of self, a negation of self. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said before affirming mishaps, I meant &quot;owning them,&quot; and only<br/>\nthereby valuing them.  Valuing them for how they shaped my current self, how<br/>\nthey taught me, guided me, help me to see things differently, etc. But at<br/>\nthe end of the day, acknowledging that &quot;I&quot; actually did them.

People can&#39;t figure out whether they&#39;re doing right -- making the choices that will move them towards their goal -- if they don&#39;t realize the goal they&#39;re headed for is a label that shifts to different places rather whimsically rather than a fixed point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost thinking parents want to be good parents. They want to raise their kids right. But what does good mean? What does right mean? For most parents the definition -- without them realizing it -- changes with each decision. Which is why decisions can seem so hard!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be like heading for San Francisco but at each cross roads you redefined what city you labeled &quot;San Francisco&quot; without realizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is to be a good parent, does that mean correcting children when they misbehave, making them happy, instilling good values, encouraging choices that will lead them to being successful, independent people discouraging choices that will lead them away? Those aren&#39;t all compatible! One parent may label all of those &quot;GOOD&quot; -- or put them all in the box they carry around in their head that&#39;s labeled &quot;GOOD&quot; (which ever analogy helps you). But a choice that moves toward one will move away from others.<br/>\n<br/>\n(In a way we&#39;re all playing with Madlibs without realizing it. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(As a side idea that&#39;s related but I haven&#39;t yet crystalized, in today&#39;s New York Times there&#39;s an article about Mitt Romney&#39;s publicity people&#39;s work to &quot;humanize&quot; him, part of which focuses on his sons to send the message that he&#39;s a &quot;successful father.&quot; The blurb says: &quot;For a campaign struggling to humanize its candidate, the Romney clan provides a camera-ready tableau for a point his advisers want to underscore: Policies aside, Mitt Romney is a successful father.&quot; Whether or not you agree with any of that, what&#39;s *implied* is that we obviously all agree we have a common definition of &quot;successful father&quot; that Mitt Romney&#39;s sons fit satisfyingly into. If there&#39;s one definition we&#39;re all working towards, and your children aren&#39;t like that, then a parent isn&#39;t being a &quot;good&quot; parent, isn&#39;t doing things &quot;right&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is to be kind, the choices become much clearer. (Though not completely clear because the goal is too narrow, too mechanical. Is it kind to give a child exactly what they want at the expense of someone else? If you can&#39;t be kind to both, is it better to be kinder to the child than an adult who can fend for themselves? (Hint: the unschooling answer is finding a way to meet the need AND be respectful.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is to give their child the skills they need to be successful in life ... Well, it sounds wonderfully noble, the makings of a good and selfless parent :-) ... It even sounds doable *if* someone&#39;s understanding is children are empty vessels awaiting filling with the good stuff. But in actual practice it will clash with the reality that children aren&#39;t empty. They are born with inherent preferences and abilities that will draw them towards what will feed their inner needs and help them turn away from what won&#39;t. The more a parent pushes against their preferences rather than working with them, the more damage they&#39;ll cause both to the child and to the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is unschooling ... What does that mean? Does it mean following the &quot;unschooling formula&quot;, making the &quot;unschooling choices&quot; -- &quot;Don&#39;t ever ...&quot;, &quot;Always ....&quot;, so your child will turn out &quot;right&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, instead, someone sees the unschooling philosophy as a tool that is very useful for helping towards some goals -- but not others -- I think things become clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goals are compatible with nurturing who their child is, are compatible with nurturing a child&#39;s ability to live peacefully with others while meeting their own needs, then the results are far more likely to turn out as you expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal works against who their child is, works against the child growing an understanding of how to meet their needs AND take others into consideration, the results are likely to be iffy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes it especially confusing is when a parent&#39;s goal, or their approach, works with their child&#39;s personality and it gets the child where the parent wanted them to be. The parent&#39;s &quot;success&quot; can then make them feel like they&#39;ve discovered some universal truth about the right way to raise kids. But they just got lucky ;-) And that&#39;s why the results of trying to be a &quot;good&quot; parent can be so iffy. What works for some families, can be a disaster for other families. And the failed parents can feel like there&#39;s something wrong with them for not being able to make the &quot;right&quot; way work. (What&#39;s &quot;wrong with them&quot; is an educational system and parenting practices that focus on knowing the right answer rather than figuring out what answers can work for what goal you have. So many people spend their childhoods feeling wrong which carries into their adulthood. They end up feeling they need to rely on the people who already have the right answers because they don&#39;t have what it takes to just know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the unschooling philosophy is combined with a compatible goal, the results are far more predictable than any other philosophy or goal because the tools and goals are compatible with human nature rather than dependent on a particular mix of personality. And then the tools support parents in exploring how the ideas can be put into practice in their family so they&#39;re compatible with the child&#39;s personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;the right way&quot;","postDate":"1346162581","msgId":68810,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjAwMWNkODUyNSRkNjEzYWJmMCQ4MjNiMDNkMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ2QkIwQ0RELUM4NUYtNEI0Qi1CRkQzLURCMDgzNUVEOUEyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEQ2QkIwQ0RELUM4NUYtNEI0Qi1CRkQzLURCMDgzNUVEOUEyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68809,"nextInTopic":68811,"prevInTime":68809,"nextInTime":68811,"topicId":68804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****I think there are better and worse ways to unschool.

Really look at them and see who *they* are and not who<br/>\nyou want them to be.  Get to know them.  Be nice to them.  Nicer than nice.<br/>\nBe kind to them.  Love them and kiss them and hug them and Be with them.<br/>\nPlay with them.  Listen to them.  Talk with them, not to them.  Be patient<br/>\nand calm.  Love your spouse or partner, if you have one.  Be kind and nice<br/>\nand patient with your spouse or partner too.  Love them and hug them and see<br/>\nwho they really are without trying to make them who you want them to be.<br/>\nRemember that you are an important person, and grab moments where you can to<br/>\nrest or eat or breathe or pause, so you can keep yourself in a happy place<br/>\nwhen your kids or your spouse/partner are tired or crabby.  Fill your house<br/>\nwith peace, toys, interesting things, good food, and love.  Create<br/>\nabundance, not scarcity, even if you have very little in terms of monetary<br/>\nresources.  Love and peace and happiness don&#39;t cost a thing :-)  Say &quot;yes&quot; a<br/>\nlot.  Do things and go places and explore the world together with your<br/>\nfamily - whether the world, to you, means your backyard, your neighborhood,<br/>\nyour town, your state/country, or a giant chunk of the globe.  Share your<br/>\npassions or interests with your kids and your partner, and revel in theirs.<br/>\nRealize your unschooling life and someone else&#39;s unschooling life won&#39;t look<br/>\nexactly just the same, and that&#39;s because your kids and their kids, your<br/>\npartner and their partner, your house and their house, your interests and<br/>\ntheir interests. they&#39;re not the same either.  But still read, talk, and<br/>\nthink about what you are doing, and listen to what others are doing.  Learn<br/>\nfrom the example of people who have been there/done that, and be an example<br/>\nfor those who will come after you on the unschooling path.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I think &quot;Doing it Right&quot; looks like :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;the right way&quot;","postDate":"1346162182","msgId":68809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDYxNjIxODIuMjY0NzQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDYxNjAyOTcuMjMzNDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEQ2QkIwQ0RELUM4NUYtNEI0Qi1CRkQzLURCMDgzNUVEOUEyNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzNDYxNjAyOTcuMjMzNDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68808,"nextInTopic":68810,"prevInTime":68808,"nextInTime":68810,"topicId":68804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK THis did not come out right;) !   You just never know what will be that will make damage your child in some way.   You just never know what will damage","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191653985\">OK THis did not come out right;) !<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You just never know what will be that will make damage your child in some way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You just never know what will damage a child&#39;s self. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense now?
