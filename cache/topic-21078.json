There are<br/>\nsome lists where you can say and do what you want and so can everyone else<br/>\nequally. And these serve a great purpose on both sides  - hmmm - scratch<br/>\nthat - more like the whole spectrum of ways of seeing and dealing with<br/>\nsubjects. On the other hand, there are others (such as this one - I am just<br/>\nnow understanding) which take a different model - and that is to allow<br/>\ncertain types of thought to have some more sway. Now you might agree or<br/>\ndisagree with the thoughts which are able to come through here (I often find<br/>\nmyself on the other side) but it&#39;s a different model. Perhaps the part that<br/>\nI have not yet understood - although I am understanding more the original<br/>\nvision ( I think ) is how this way aligns with unschooling. For myself, I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking at this forum now as an exception in the sense that it is intended<br/>\nfor adults who are able to judge for themselves if those in a position to<br/>\nmoderate are giving them what they need or not - as opposed to the<br/>\nvulnerable position in which children find themselves being not respected by<br/>\nsomeone in a position of authority over them. No one here is really in<br/>\nauthority over any of us - if we choose to view them that way - that&#39;s<br/>\nreally happening in our heads.

It&#39;s something I&#39;ve struggled<br/>\nwith - having found myself often in situations where I was a part of the<br/>\n&quot;chosen&quot; when I was asked to downplay whatever skills had landed me there in<br/>\norder to allow everyone equal time and also being able to shine but having<br/>\nmany cry &quot;unfair&quot;, as well as sometimes not making that cut and having to<br/>\nwatch from the sidelines, I&#39;ve considered these things too.

I know I have and now this response you&#39;ve made has<br/>\nput it into a different perspective.

He had a teacher&#39;s-lounge rant about how wrong it was <br/>\nfor our district to spend so much on basketball and encourage these boys to <br/>\nhope maybe they could play professionally, when the reality was that the local <br/>\ngene pool rarely produced a man who was six feet tall, and that &quot;created equal&quot; <br/>\ndidn&#39;t take those realities into effect.   Soccer, he said, they&#39;d have a <br/>\nchance.  But soccer wasn&#39;t the fashion in northern New Mexico in the 70&#39;s and <br/>\n80&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys DID love basketball at that school.  And they WERE encouraged.  And <br/>\nLouie was right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more years than not in my adult life run music groups at Christmas, to <br/>\ndo medieval and Renaissance Christmas carols.  This year we have only six <br/>\nparticipants, and we might not perform more than once.  That&#39;s okay, because the <br/>\nsinging is just for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome years there were 20 or 30, and we performed a couple of medieval feasts, <br/>\na couple of public things, and wen caroling.   Each year some people were <br/>\nfrustrated.  There&#39;s a philosophical question that can&#39;t be avoided in such <br/>\ncases, and that is which goal is greater:  the quality of the music or providing <br/>\neach participant an opportunity to perform period music in a group.    If the <br/>\nquality is too low, the best singers are frustrated (and the audience).  If the <br/>\nquality consideration is too high, some singers need to be kept in the <br/>\nbackground or discouraged altogether.  It&#39;s tiring to be in that decision-making, <br/>\norganizational position, because invariably someone whose contribution has been <br/>\nto show up to half the practices will complain on the side yet audibly at some <br/>\npoint, either that the performances aren&#39;t rehearsed enough or that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a used Saturn yesterday, from a friend.  I have another friend who&#39;s <br/>\na Saturn owner, and I called her for advice in advance.  She&#39;s a very frugal <br/>\nand analytical person, and she gave me exactly the advice I wanted.  I trusted <br/>\nher because I&#39;ve known her for a long time.  I&#39;ve ridden in various cars of <br/>\nhers.  I picked her up from the scene of a T-bone accident that was not at all <br/>\nher fault.  She is a credible, experienced, thoughtful source.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s driving a &#39;93 and I was considering a &#39;96.  She knew off the top of her <br/>\nhead what engineering improvements had been made, and what problems I might <br/>\nencounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I not had that resource, I would have looked online for a Saturn owners <br/>\ndiscussion.   When I got there, I would have been willing to double check <br/>\nanything I read, because I didn&#39;t have years to hang out and get to know the <br/>\npeople.  But in the course of a quick inquiry, it would matter to me whether the <br/>\nperson had owned Saturns or repaired them or been a lawyer in claims, or was just <br/>\nthere considering, as I was, for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone claimed to have owned three Saturns and it turned out it was a <br/>\nlie, that would be a turd in the lemonade for sure.  But even assuming people <br/>\nwere being honest, some opinions are more valuable than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people consider e-mail discussions to be a social opportunity, or a tea <br/>\nparty.  Some are.  But a discussion marked to discuss unstopping is not, for <br/>\nme, an opportunity for everyone who comes by to be equally heard and considered <br/>\nand promoted.  Some people are wonderful at describing what they do with <br/>\ntheir children.  Some aren&#39;t as good with words, and words are all we have here.   <br/>\nSome people have just discovered unstopping and some have been at it for a <br/>\nwhile.  Some got it easily and can describe clearly how their thinking process <br/>\nwent.  Some have struggled for years and are missing some aspect or concept <br/>\nthat might make all the difference.  Some are very logical, while others don&#39;t <br/>\nthink logic has a value.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in a discussion which some people will join for a while, get what they <br/>\nneed, and move on, it&#39;s important to me as a moderator that they get clear, <br/>\nuseful information and not obfuscation or dishonesty.  This shouldn&#39;t be anyone&#39;s <br/>\nsole source of information, and it&#39;s fine for it to be a specialized subset of <br/>\nideas.  For me, on this list, clear and useful and positive are more valuable <br/>\nthan muddled and troublesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay for basketball teams to prefer tall, athletic people.<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay for a music group to be organized to give people a chance to sing <br/>\nin public, but it&#39;s also okay to have groups chosen by audition only.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: the idea of equality","postDate":"1097227380","msgId":21095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEOEJENEI0LjJENjNBJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNrNHFqaSt0MzQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21094,"nextInTopic":21096,"prevInTime":21094,"nextInTime":21096,"topicId":21078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But we each have an  equal STAKE in the community and the future.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nBut is that really true?  After all, those with greater financial wealth can just move out of that community if/when things get bad, even if that worsening is the result of their acts or policies the rich supported.  Often, it&#39;s only the poor and middle class who have a real stake in the community, in that they can&#39;t easily escape or that their lives will be measurably better if the community improves.  The rich would still be rich and powerful, and in fact, making their community more enjoyable and better for others might lessen their wealth and power.  So, really the stakes aren&#39;t equal -- neither is the risk.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the original myth, it&#39;s that all men are &#39;created equal&#39; -- even that&#39;s assuming too much. What about birth defects, or financial opportunities, or even just the fact that some people are smarter than others?  Maybe not so much smarter as just one is great at math, another at communication, and another very good with his hands, or some such thing.  But equal in abilities and strengths doesn&#39;t even hold true for all identical twins, and they have the same dna.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn an ideal world, everyone would have equal opportunities -- really hard to achieve even today -- or be of equal value to the world/community. While that may already be true in the ideal sense, that&#39;s not the way it works out day-to-day.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe real problem I see with this myth is that it breeds contempt and jealousy.  It also gives the powers that be a platform for programs like public school and other standardized programs.  It&#39;s appealing to think you are as good as your neighbor, or at least to think he&#39;s no better than you. It&#39;s a great distraction to keep us from focusing on our own abilities and potential.   The average person is too busy being sure his kids get the &#39;same education&#39; as kids in the better neighborhoods and the like to have any energy left over to question the inherent unfairness of making all things equal.<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t care whether or not I&#39;m equal to my neighbor or anyone else.  I do want to be treated fairly, and strive to treat others fairly.  As someone else posted, there&#39;s a difference between fair and equal, as concepts.  Fair involves assessing a person&#39;s strengths and needs and acting accordingly in a way that blesses as many people as possible.  Equal is arbitrary and doesn&#39;t take into account the individuality of each person involved.  <br/>\n <br/>\nDid Sandra also ask if we&#39;re all euqal here?  If so, the answer is no -- everyone has his/her own level of experience, perspective and insights.  Sometimes, one person is more adept at a top than someone else, but that&#39;s just as likely to change tomorrow as not.  I think to the extent that posting here is very much what&#39;s described on the front page, it&#39;s as fair as it can be.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the idea of equality","postDate":"1097183226","msgId":21085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlkLjUwMzZhNTBiLjJlOTcwOWZhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21083,"nextInTopic":21086,"prevInTime":21084,"nextInTime":21086,"topicId":21078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/7/2004 12:12:50 PM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: I know  that it is central to American mythology that All men are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2123066654\">In a message dated 10/7/2004 12:12:50 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI know  that it is central to American mythology that &quot;All men are created  <br/>\nequal.&quot;  That was central before the abolition of slavery, and before  women <br/>\ncould <br/>\nown patents or vote.

It&#39;s not cheery.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll quote the first part and then put a link for more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren&#39;t only equal <br/>\nbefore God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter <br/>\nthan anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was <br/>\nstronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, <br/>\n212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of <br/>\nagents of the United States Handicapper General. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things about living still weren&#39;t quite right, though. April for <br/>\ninstance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in that clammy <br/>\nmonth that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron&#39;s fourteen-year-old <br/>\nson, Harrison, away. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn&#39;t think about it very <br/>\nhard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn&#39;t <br/>\nthink about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence <br/>\nwas way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was <br/>\nrequired by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. <br/>\nEvery twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise <br/>\nto keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel&#39;s <br/>\ncheeks, but she&#39;d forgotten for the moment what they were about. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the television screen were ballerinas. <br/>\n<br/>\nA buzzer sounded in George&#39;s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits <br/>\nfrom a burglar alarm. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,&quot; said Hazel. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Huh&quot; said George. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That dance-it was nice,&quot; said Hazel. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yup,&quot; said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They <br/>\nweren&#39;t really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway. <br/>\nThey were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces were <br/>\nmasked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, <br/>\nwould feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague <br/>\nnotion that maybe dancers shouldn&#39;t be handicapped. But he didn&#39;t get very far with <br/>\nit before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas. <br/>\n<br/>\nHazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask George <br/>\nwhat the latest sound had been. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://penguinppc.org/~hollis/personal/bergeron.shtml\">http://penguinppc.org/~hollis/personal/bergeron.shtml</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the idea of equality","postDate":"1097171106","msgId":21080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDA3LjEwNDUwNi4zMDUyLjMuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21078,"nextInTopic":21081,"prevInTime":21079,"nextInTime":21081,"topicId":21078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you read the short story Harrison Bergeron?
