I&#39;m working on my own thyroid issues at the moment and this site has been a godsend.  It&#39;s a mistake to go by the TSH alone, and then to use a T4-only medication.  If your doctor won&#39;t order the tests that really show what&#39;s going on accurately (T3, free T3, free T4, antibodies, etc), you can order them yourself.  Since you asked for info from anyone who&#39;s had a child with thyroid issues (and I don&#39;t) I won&#39;t post my own thyroid story, but if anyone wants more info feel free to email me.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Kathie<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. The author of the site I linked to can sound a little...hyper :) - don&#39;t let that put you off.  When you read about how many people are misdiagnosed for years on end, the passion at wanting to counter that is understandable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back in July 2011 I had written (in a post titled &quot;Mums and computers&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a park across the street and there was a fete for July 14th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (french<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; national day) with fireworks.
