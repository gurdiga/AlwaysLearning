I am also nursing a 7 week old.  Yesterday, my nine year<br/>\nold came home from a friend/relatives house saying his foot was hurt.<br/>\n Throughout the afternoon, his injury slowly got worse until he<br/>\nadjusted the little ones crutches for his own use.  Milo, with the<br/>\nbroken leg, got upset, because even though he doesn&#39;t use them often<br/>\nthey are his.  Skylar won&#39;t give them back.  His reasoning is that<br/>\nMilo does not use them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Skylar has been demanding almost all of our attention last night<br/>\nand today.  He has had one major meltdown already.  These are few and<br/>\nfar between for him, but not abnormal.  He is a very level headed kid<br/>\nmost of the time, but something has creeped up for him.  He seems to<br/>\nbe opposing anything and everything.  He asks for help, then when its<br/>\ngiven he refuses it.  He complains about how badly his foot hurts yet<br/>\nrefuses to see a doctor.  He has twice fallen down with the crutches.<br/>\n Once almost doing a face plant and actually hurting his other foot. <br/>\nI suggested he rest his foot and watch a movie or play video games but<br/>\nhe insists on hobbling around the house while throwing himself upon<br/>\nthe furniture and all over the floor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is REALLY wound up right now.  I&#39;m trying to accommodate him<br/>\nhowever we can.  We&#39;ve been getting him ice packs and listening to his<br/>\nneeds.  I&#39;m really frustrated with this.  Maybe more than I should be.<br/>\n We are really focusing on him since we know that he is probably<br/>\nfeeling a little left out attention wise.  We&#39;re driving him 2 hours<br/>\nnorth to get a drum for the conference and getting him a new phone<br/>\ntoday even though we originally said he would probably have to choose.<br/>\n I&#39;m running around getting him food and ice packs and whatever he<br/>\nneeds while the baby cries and while his brother waits for someone to<br/>\ntake him to the bathroom.  I&#39;m certain his injury isn&#39;t quite as bad<br/>\nas he is letting on, but I do not want to say that and I do want to<br/>\nimply that i don&#39;t believe him.  I totally believe his foot hurts.  He<br/>\njumped off a truck. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some internal dialogue.  I need some things to tell myself that<br/>\nwill help me stay patient with him.
