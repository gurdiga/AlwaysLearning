I&#39;m not sure what  <br/>\nthe options are, but that&#39;s what happened on my computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an interesting site, about changes in technology and culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was involved in a discussion, it&#39;s not available to hear.  It&#39;s not  <br/>\nas clear as some of the sound files online, but it&#39;s rich and busy and  <br/>\nhas a ton of stuff.  His summary at the end amazed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe notes there are:<br/>\nSpecial one-hour Yi-Tan Call 248 – Unschooling –<br/>\nOur primary and secondary educational systems are controversial, to  <br/>\nput it mildly. John Holt, Grace Llewelyn, Paulo Freire, John Taylor  <br/>\nGatto and others have done a fabulous job pointing out how deficient  <br/>\nthe existing systems are, as well as lighting a path forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne growing alternative is unschooling. Unlike the popular home- <br/>\nschooling stereotype of parents sharing “classroom” duties at home,  <br/>\nunschooling is mostly student-led (and I wince using the word  <br/>\n“student”). Explaining it in any depth is beyond the scope of these  <br/>\nlightweight invites, so please join this call and explore with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe’ve invited a wonderful group of deeply experienced unschoolers,  <br/>\nadult and adult-to-be, including Tammy Takahashi, Sandra Dodd, PS  <br/>\nPirro, some of our Yi-Tan regulars and their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this awesome posse, let’s discuss:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t• What is the range of unschooling practices? How quickly is it  <br/>\ngrowing?<br/>\n\t• How does the rest of the world respond to unschooling? Is that  <br/>\nchanging?<br/>\n\t• What are the main benefits the Net brings unschoolers?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48037,"nextTopicId":48054}}
