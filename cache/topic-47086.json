The encopresis was worse when he was in public school and after we moved. I suspect that stress may have been a factor. It is much better now since we&#39;ve been settled for over a year and we unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the enuresis, we simply encourage him to use the toilet, especially when we see visual signals that he needs to go. Sometimes he doesn&#39;t want to stop playing. So we offer to pause whatever we&#39;re doing and remind him that it only takes a minute to pee. Other times, if he gets very excited or laughs heartily, he can&#39;t hold his urine. When we see major silliness beginning, we encourage him to quickly use the toilet and come back.  Actually, unschooling has helped a lot with the enuresis. It helped me to heed wise voices who reminded me that he is still very young. And, when I stopped comparing him to same age peers, then he could just be who he is without expectation of toileting perfection. And, when we accepted that accidents would happen, then we became less stressed about it. Instead of making a big deal over it, we just tell him to change his clothes and ask if there is a puddle that we need to clean. We wash the boys&#39; laundry frequently. We use pull-ups at night, and we have rubber-bottomed mattress protectors under the regular bed sheets to keep leaks from soiling the mattresses. We have a set of spares so we don&#39;t have to wash them immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe handle the encopresis a bit differently. We remind him every other day that his body needs to have a bowel movement to rid itself of waste. We allow him to choose the time, so he doesn&#39;t miss a favorite program or running errands with Dad. We let him choose the bathroom (usually close to Mom as he still wants help wiping). We provide a stool so his feet don&#39;t dangle and so he has a place to rest his favorite bathroom book (a visual dictionary). If he resists, we don&#39;t force him to sit. But we do gently remind him of how uncomfortable it is when he has encopresis. Sometimes we talk about how drinking more liquid might help his bowel movements because he drinks very little in a day. We keep fresh fruit out all day so he gets some hydration from the fruit. He doesn&#39;t like many fibrous vegetables, but we do use whole grain bread products. (Doctors have differing opinions about the role of fiber and fluid in preventing constipation.) And, if he does develop encopresis, then we use a laxative to help him pass the hard stool and become regular again. We put him in a pullup until he can go - without any shame. We simply explain that we can&#39;t have the stool leaking onto the clothes, furniture, rugs, etc. And we throw away his underpants because I don&#39;t want to clean them. We buy the least expensive, plain white, multipacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of these ideas help. Encopresis and enuresis can be frustrating for everyone. I remind myself that he doesn&#39;t soil his clothes on purpose. He usually can&#39;t feel the leakage until it&#39;s gone. And then I remember to just breathe....<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;crbrlw&quot; &lt;carabarlow@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi: <br/>\n&gt; I have an old friend who is new homeschooling/now wants to unschool.
