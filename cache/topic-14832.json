While the ideas being shared are good, it&#39;s just a shame to be required to find educational value in PB.  It has such incredible value -- obvious by the many suggestions -- just as it is.  Too bad the school system requires you to make an assignment of it -- some kids will miss it&#39;s treasure because for them, it will always be that movie they had to watch in mid-school.  Sometimes I&#39;m convinced the purpose of school is to suck the joy out of life entirely...<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s because I spent most of an hour on the phone with my sis yesterday, trying to help her see why I don&#39;t think public school is the great success for everyone that it&#39;s been so far for her son.
