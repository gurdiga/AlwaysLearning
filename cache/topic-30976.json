Dh was busy exploring our new camera, and one of the <br/>\nphotos will always be a favourite of mine I think. It is from behind, of <br/>\nme and my 17yo son walking down the beach together - public place, quite <br/>\na few people around, some may even have known him - he was talking to me <br/>\nand put his arm around me and we walked down the beach arms round each <br/>\nother for about ten minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday night, after a very miserable day, I was feeling terrible <br/>\nabout something that is happening to my oldest ds26. I picked my 17yo up <br/>\nfrom work at 4.30. It was meant to be 4 but he was busy finishing a job, <br/>\nso while I waited I talked to ds 20 who works at the same place. I was <br/>\nstill feeling terrible, and just needing to touch base with all my sons, <br/>\nso drove to my husband&#39;s work and.... (still in my gardening clothes) we <br/>\ndrove 2 hours and got takeaway kebabs for dinner with my other son, 24, <br/>\nwho is away at university. Yeah, slightly crazy, I know, but still, I <br/>\nfelt a lot better for touching base! But while we were waiting for our <br/>\nkebabs, ds 24 sat beside me talking, with his arm around me having a <br/>\ncuddle. I noticed some strange looks from other people, but whether he <br/>\nnoticed I don&#39;t know - if he did, it didn&#39;t stop him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about how it is in America, but here in New Zealand that is <br/>\ncertainly not the way &#39;normal&#39; boys aged 17 -24 behave.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 17yo, who had had a very long week having worked his first ever full <br/>\nweek at work (43 hours) and was very tired, but who misses his older <br/>\nbrother hugely, said several times, &#39;thank you so much for bringing me <br/>\nto see Steve&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so fortunate.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"postDate":"1191679720","msgId":30976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyOTcwLjUxODU0LnFtQHdlYjYwMi5iaXoubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30979,"prevInTime":30975,"nextInTime":30977,"topicId":30976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This was sent to me from the moderator of another group, and it reminds me of a story I can share: ***************** I don t doubt for a moment that my friends","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1028663225\">This was sent to me from the moderator of another group, and it reminds me of a story I can share:<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t doubt for a moment that my friends feel as much love in their heart for their kids as I do for my kids. But as much joy in parenting them? As much trust in their relationship with them? As much connection with them? I don&#39;t know. Something tells me maybe not. I hear more complaints than joy, they express reluctance to do things with their kids, share stories about how much trouble their teenagers are, and make comments like &quot;Gosh, I can&#39;t wait until school starts back next month!&quot;<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about funky formatting; I&#39;m on a friend&#39;s computer and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I wanted to say was that Holly and I are in Minnesota, where we came for a conference last weekend. Holly will be sixteen in a month.  Kelli Traaseth, whose three children are younger but not lots younger, has wonderfully and generously hosted us and taken us to see some beautiful parts of Minnesota, and it&#39;s been a long busy week, with lots of talking and laughing and not enough sleep.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I had packed up all my stuff and left one bag mostly empty, and I told Holly she could put her dirty clothes or anything she wanted to in there.   I was in the bed reading, and after a bit she said &quot;Thanks for making it so easy to pack my stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while I had fallen asleep, but she might not have known it.  She came up on the bed we were sharing and leaned over me and it woke me up and I thought she was going to say &quot;You left your light on&quot; or to ask me something, but she said &quot;I&#39;m glad I came with you.  I&#39;ve had a lot of fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStories like that of fifteen-nearly-sixteen-year-old girls aren&#39;t so common in the culture at large, I don&#39;t think.   And Holly missed two friends&#39; birthdays, and is looking forward to going straight from the airport to a party Saturday night, so it&#39;s not like she would&#39;ve been bored at home, but she&#39;s still glad to hang out with me and that&#39;s pretty wonderful.  And she will spontaneously express it.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery soon instead of saying &quot;I have three kids who are 10, 13 and 15 (or whatever it was that day) I&#39;ll be saying &quot;I have two kids at home who are 16 and 18.&quot;   That sounds so old...  And still we have fun together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30977,"nextTopicId":30980}}
