So I <br/>\ngot all the kids to help decide what could go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome was easy--stinky paints, dried up markers, old game parts to games we <br/>\nwere going to throw away for being in too bad a shape, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we had a lot of Duplo.  And we had just lately gotten to know a sweet, <br/>\ncute, four year old boy named Django.  So we gave him the Duplo.<br/>\n<br/>\nA year later, Holly missed the Duplo.  She was pretty grumpy that it was <br/>\ngone.  So (embarrassed) I contacted Django&#39;s mom to confirm, for Holly&#39;s <br/>\nbenefit, that yes he DID like the Duplo and played with it a lot, and that <br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t let him give it away to someone else.  So when Django thinks <br/>\nhe&#39;s too old for the Duplo, Holly&#39;s supposed to get it back.  I&#39;m hoping that <br/>\nwhen that time comes, Holly will be old enough to let him keep it.  Because <br/>\nif he gives it to Holly, he might come to miss it too.  And his mom might <br/>\nhave other babies, but Holly&#39;s mom&#39;s not!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other was a box of coloring books from when Kirby was little.  He loved <br/>\ncoloring books, but wouldn&#39;t color them all (sometimes none--just look at all <br/>\nthe pictures).<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought we had decided to chuck them.  Holly looked for them and was sad.  <br/>\nLooking for something else in the garage, she found the box of coloring books <br/>\nand brought some in to color in.  Super Mario Brothers. &lt;g&gt;  Lion King. <br/>\n(Stuff that used to be readily available and now is antique!)  Tom Sawyer <br/>\n(which makes her aske me about Tom Sawyer quite a bit, but she declines to <br/>\nhave me read it to her.
