But<br/>\nI think it is rather melodramatic for most instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we do owe some consideration to other children, particularly when<br/>\nthey are sadly effected by the actions of our children.  I do not think my<br/>\nkids are &quot;more important&quot; than someone else&#39;s or that their sadness is<br/>\nsomehow more poignant.  However, I also don&#39;t think that the consideration<br/>\nof others is more important than my child.  A balance is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like most things, this isn&#39;t an either-or scenario.  A parent might talk<br/>\nto the coach about little Billy not enjoying the season and see if his<br/>\nquitting would adversely effect the team (not enough players, etc.).  A<br/>\nparent might talk with little Billy about exactly what the issue is and see<br/>\nif it can be resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn most team situations, one kid, who doesn&#39;t want to be there anyway,<br/>\nquitting makes little difference to the team.  Unless there aren&#39;t enough<br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI taught karate and worked with 4-h groups for years.  As the &quot;adult in<br/>\ncharge&quot; I would personally prefer that any child that doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nthere, go home.  It is a real drain on the energy of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 04, 2004 5:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] quitting activities<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/4/2004 3:34:09 PM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; Music lessons are different.

Ultimately it would be <br/>\nher decision.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I said, yes, it would be Lexie&#39;s decision, she could quit if she had <br/>\nlooked at everything and then still made the decision to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; HOW?<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want an explanation, because I know how mainstream parents <br/>\n&gt; force kids<br/>\n&gt; to do things.

See above.  See my last post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nobody can make a child play soccer.

But we aren&#39;t talking about mainstreamed parents. Brandy asked <br/>\nwhat our opinion was.  And because I knew everyone would say &quot;oh yes, <br/>\nlet them quit&quot; I wanted to give the opposite side of it.  I also said <br/>\nclearly in another post that there was a big difference between a 5 year <br/>\nold and tball and a older child with competetive sports or a play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-&quot;would have to-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two friends of mine showed school and their parents they did not have <br/>\n&gt; to do<br/>\n&gt; anything they didn&#39;t want to.  They killed themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s powerful and sad.  Of course parents don&#39;t have control over <br/>\ntheir children.  Most of us here know this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Their faces and voices and laughter and their funerals are always in <br/>\n&gt; the back<br/>\n&gt; of my mind when any parent tells me a child has to do something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; And the parents can&#39;t make them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the inconvenience to the band when the only bass clarinetest or the<br/>\n&gt; second chair trumpet puts a bullet in his or her head is NOTHING <br/>\n&gt; compared to the<br/>\n&gt; pain of the parents from then on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But say I get off of my morbid reminiscence and just say this:  Is the<br/>\n&gt; inconvenience to a team or a play worth a lifetime of sorrow and <br/>\n&gt; powerlessness<br/>\n&gt; delivered into the lap of a child who really does not want to play <br/>\n&gt; T-Ball or soccer<br/>\n&gt; or sing in the chorus of ten back-up singers <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those are not my examples.  They are your examples.  Tball is usually <br/>\nnoncompetitive, with lots of kids.  A chorus of 10 back up singers would <br/>\nbe the same.  What&#39;s one more or less?  My examples was a competetive <br/>\nsoccer team where the other kids on the team would be effected by one <br/>\ngirl quitting.  I think that when the kids get older the answer of <br/>\n&quot;sure, let&#39;m quit, no big deal&quot; because a bit more complicated and I <br/>\nthink the parent has a responsibility to help the child/young person <br/>\nknow of these complications so that the child can make an informed <br/>\ndecision--to quit or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like you believe there are two extreems and nothing in the middle.  <br/>\nI&#39;m seeing mostly the middle.  If my child was so very unhappy with <br/>\nsoccer or a play, I wouldn&#39;t give a damn about the other kids or <br/>\nparents, we would do what it took to help and if that meant quitting and <br/>\nleaving the others in a lurch, well, so be it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the parent says &quot;You HAVE<br/>\n&gt; to, for the sake of others who are not my children, who are not my<br/>\n&gt; responsibility&quot;?  The temporary, seasonal inconvenience of strangers <br/>\n&gt; is worse than your<br/>\n&gt; real, continuing sadness?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What a ridiculous question, of course not.  But I&#39;m not talking about <br/>\ncontinuing sadness.  If a child commits suicide there are far deeper <br/>\nissues then playing on a team or not.  I think what Brandy was talking <br/>\nabout was a child, who is five, who sorta likes tball, sometimes, but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really want to continue for whatever reason, and should the <br/>\nparent insist on finishing the season, especially because there was <br/>\nmoney paid.  What I was talking about is a nine year old who just ups <br/>\nand quits soccer or a play for no real reason except it&#39;s too hard or <br/>\nwhatever. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So...<br/>\n&gt; The original question was if a child is unhappy in an activity you&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; already<br/>\n&gt; paid for, would you  let him quit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends upon the activity, the level of unhappiness, the situation as <br/>\na whole, when during the activity they wish to quit, etc. etc. etc.  For <br/>\nthe most part, the answer is, what I said above, that it would be <br/>\nultimately the child&#39;s decision, and if they wanted to quit, I&#39;d stand <br/>\nby that decision.  But it would not happen without discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My answer is:  Only if you really care about his spirit and his mental<br/>\n&gt; health.  Only if you really love him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anything in life is this simple. I don&#39;t think this is an <br/>\neither or situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

There are no 8-10 other kids who are relying <br/>\nupon each other to form a team.  Lexie did take piano for a while.   <br/>\nWhen she asked to quit, she quit.  The only person effected by her <br/>\ndecision was the piano teacher, and herself.  When others are effected, <br/>\nthen that needs to be taken into consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example. I have a 10th grader who wants to homeschool.  He&#39;s on the <br/>\nbaseball team and is one of the starting players.  He wants to quit even <br/>\nthough the team could go to championships, etc.  If it was just a school <br/>\nissue, no big deal.  But there is a team involved who have hopes of <br/>\ndoing well.  I think my child would need to consider all those that will <br/>\nbe effected by his decision to quit school, and not just think about <br/>\nhimself.  We do not live in a vaccuum.  We live with other people and <br/>\nthose people need to be considered if they will be changed by our decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

They might want to know that it <br/>\ncould effect future opportunities of that kind.  But I would also make <br/>\nit clear that similar opportunities might not be.  Still, a mistake can <br/>\nbe made.  A mind can change.  Is it more important to meet everyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s needs or one&#39;s own? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile thinking about this topic I remembered an incident from my adult <br/>\nlife.  When I was pregnant for the first time, I was working full time.  <br/>\nThe first few months were rough with feeling and getting sick many times <br/>\nduring the day (and my office wasn&#39;t very close to a bathroom).  I also <br/>\nhad to drive close to an hour to work.  I would get raging headaches a <br/>\ncouple of times a week.  I had an offsite workshop to lead one day.  I <br/>\narranged to have a backup knowing that I might not feel good that day.  <br/>\nSure enough, I woke with a headache.  I could barely lift my head off <br/>\nthe pillow to call my backup.  She was obviously put out.  I guess she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t expecting to have to actually back me up :-)  It was such a hard <br/>\nphone call to make and I lay there feeling bad about it for quite <br/>\nawhile.  In any case, the awful pressure of worrying about everyone else <br/>\nwhen I felt like sh....  was not what I needed at that moment.  But it <br/>\nis something I struggle with all of the time.  I give this as an extreme <br/>\nexample because my reason was socially acceptable.  Of course, if you&#39;re <br/>\nsick....  I can hear people saying.  But what difference does it make <br/>\nwhat your reason is?  And even though my reason was &quot;acceptable&quot;, my <br/>\npoint is that I still had the hardest time cancelling at the last minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to pass on that meme to my kids.  Give them the information <br/>\nabout what others expect and want (and potential, not definite, <br/>\nramifications of quitting).  But first and foremost I want them to trust <br/>\nthemselves to do what is right for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s another look on this.  This last year, Lexie played soccer.  The<br/>\n&gt; teams all played 9 on the field at a time, but most had 10 on a team. <br/>\n&gt; They should have had 11 or 12, to give everyone a chance to rest.  If<br/>\n&gt; any girl was absent for a game, everyone else had to play the entire<br/>\n&gt; game.  If more than one was absent, we played still, all the game with<br/>\n&gt; one less than the other team.  Some girls, like Lexie, were strongly<br/>\n&gt; committed, and were at every practice and every game.  Others missed for<br/>\n&gt; whatever reason they wished.  Their lack of commitment had a huge impact<br/>\n&gt; on how well we did as a team.    Another team started with 10, and due<br/>\n&gt; to girls quitting, they ended up with six girls at the end of the<br/>\n&gt; season.  This was not good.  They still played, lost almost all their<br/>\n&gt; games, and yet they played.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lexie&#39;s now involved in Peter Pan.  Basically they have a rule, once<br/>\n&gt; rehearsals begin, you can&#39;t quit.  I understand this rule.  A few kids<br/>\n&gt; quit each time, and basically they don&#39;t get in the next play, nor do<br/>\n&gt; any of the other youth theaters want them in those plays.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; difficult to manage a play around kids who quit.  I do think there is a<br/>\n&gt; difference between a five year old playing tball and a 9 year old<br/>\n&gt; playing soccer, but I do think that a child needs to learn that they<br/>\n&gt; have a commitment to finish some activities, especially if others are<br/>\n&gt; counting on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the balance is.  I know it&#39;s not with tball.  Last<br/>\n&gt; year Janene was going to be in Annie.  She decided to not be in the<br/>\n&gt; cast.  Lexie was in the cast. All through the rehearsals and show,<br/>\n&gt; Janene sometimes would say she was sorry she quit (before the 1st<br/>\n&gt; rehearsal) and other times she&#39;d say she was glad.  When the Peter Pan<br/>\n&gt; thing came up, we gave her the option, reminding her of the rule that<br/>\n&gt; once rehearsals began, she couldn&#39;t quit.  She made the decision to be a<br/>\n&gt; part of the cast and she&#39;s done well, but occasionally she says she<br/>\n&gt; wants to quit but knows she can&#39;t.  I&#39;d say more often she&#39;s glad she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in the play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janene had the same mixed feelings with soccer, wanting to play but not<br/>\n&gt; wanting.  I don&#39;t make my kids eat things they don&#39;t wish to eat, and<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t make them finish other things they begin, but I do think some<br/>\n&gt; activities require a commitment and that when others will be effected by<br/>\n&gt; a choice to quit, that needs to be considered before quitting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\n$0 Bannerless Web Hosting, 10 POP and Web Email Accounts, & more<br/>\nGet It Now At www.doteasy.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] quitting activities","postDate":"1081084304","msgId":19230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNDA0MTMxMTQ0LkdNTEwyNDczMy5tdGExMS5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwNkZFQjNGLjgwNjAwMDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":19229,"nextInTopic":19231,"prevInTime":19229,"nextInTime":19231,"topicId":19201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds frustrating to not have enough players on your team.

He spends all week looking forward to <br/>\nThursday and Friday and when we missed one of the classes, he was <br/>\ngenuinely upset. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that part of the problem with t-ball was that we have all <br/>\nbeen feeling overscheduled lately. He had wanted to take a class at <br/>\nthe nature center on Monday afternoons. He had t-ball on Wed. and <br/>\nSat. and karate on Thurs. and Fri. We went from having no scheduled <br/>\nactivities except for homeschool group park days, to having to be <br/>\nsomewhere four days in a row. I was hesitant to jump into all of <br/>\nthis at once, but he really insisted that he wanted to do both <br/>\nkarate and t-ball. Looking back it really was too much at once for <br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has always been very social and asks to go out everyday. A few <br/>\nweeks ago, he asked to stay home from the park day and then chose to <br/>\nskip a friend&#39;s birthday party to stay home with dh. We spent the <br/>\nnext week just chilling out at home, blowing off everything except <br/>\nkarate, and he seemed much better after that. We didn&#39;t finish out <br/>\nthe four week course at the nature center either. I was asking him <br/>\nif he wanted to sign up for the next session and he couldn&#39;t decide. <br/>\nI asked him how he felt about the class and what he liked and <br/>\ndisliked. He said he likes going there to explore on his own and ask <br/>\nLorri (the naturalist) questions alone. He didn&#39;t like following <br/>\nwith the group of other kids and stopping all the time to do the <br/>\nactivities and talk. It was one of those a-ha moments when I <br/>\nrealized that we had really made the right decision, in choosing to <br/>\nhomeschool our kids.

And then a couple of<br/>\nmonths later I found out about a hs fencing class (5 mins from my house)<br/>\nand since Jason really enjoyed the Redwall books, I asked him if he<br/>\nwanted to try it...he did and loves it too. Oh and now after taking a<br/>\nbreak Jason decided that he wanted to do soccer again and is loving it<br/>\ntoo. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my lesson has been to not be afraid of quitting something that just<br/>\nis not working because it may free you up for something even better to<br/>\ncome along. :o) I do think that it also depends on whether or not other<br/>\npeople are depending on you, but at 6 or 7 I definitely think that they<br/>\nusually have more options then many parents give kids. I also think that<br/>\nthere is something to be said about learning to cut your losses rather<br/>\nthen sticking to something that is not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: quitting activities","postDate":"1081045724","msgId":19220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA0MDMxODI4MDEuMDJmMTM0MzBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0bmUyMCtlMTdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM0bjEzYytiYWZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8YzRuZTIwK2UxN3NAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19219,"nextInTopic":19221,"prevInTime":19219,"nextInTime":19221,"topicId":19201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The <br/>\nteams all played 9 on the field at a time, but most had 10 on a team.  <br/>\nThey should have had 11 or 12, to give everyone a chance to rest.  If <br/>\nany girl was absent for a game, everyone else had to play the entire <br/>\ngame.  If more than one was absent, we played still, all the game with <br/>\none less than the other team.  Some girls, like Lexie, were strongly <br/>\ncommitted, and were at every practice and every game.  Others missed for <br/>\nwhatever reason they wished.  Their lack of commitment had a huge impact <br/>\non how well we did as a team.    Another team started with 10, and due <br/>\nto girls quitting, they ended up with six girls at the end of the <br/>\nseason.  This was not good.  They still played, lost almost all their <br/>\ngames, and yet they played. <br/>\n<br/>\nLexie&#39;s now involved in Peter Pan.  Basically they have a rule, once <br/>\nrehearsals begin, you can&#39;t quit.  I understand this rule.  A few kids <br/>\nquit each time, and basically they don&#39;t get in the next play, nor do <br/>\nany of the other youth theaters want them in those plays.  It&#39;s <br/>\ndifficult to manage a play around kids who quit.  I do think there is a <br/>\ndifference between a five year old playing tball and a 9 year old <br/>\nplaying soccer, but I do think that a child needs to learn that they <br/>\nhave a commitment to finish some activities, especially if others are <br/>\ncounting on them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what the balance is.  I know it&#39;s not with tball.  Last <br/>\nyear Janene was going to be in Annie.  She decided to not be in the <br/>\ncast.  Lexie was in the cast. All through the rehearsals and show, <br/>\nJanene sometimes would say she was sorry she quit (before the 1st <br/>\nrehearsal) and other times she&#39;d say she was glad.  When the Peter Pan <br/>\nthing came up, we gave her the option, reminding her of the rule that <br/>\nonce rehearsals began, she couldn&#39;t quit.  She made the decision to be a <br/>\npart of the cast and she&#39;s done well, but occasionally she says she <br/>\nwants to quit but knows she can&#39;t.  I&#39;d say more often she&#39;s glad she&#39;s <br/>\nin the play. <br/>\n<br/>\nJanene had the same mixed feelings with soccer, wanting to play but not <br/>\nwanting.  I don&#39;t make my kids eat things they don&#39;t wish to eat, and <br/>\ndon&#39;t make them finish other things they begin, but I do think some <br/>\nactivities require a commitment and that when others will be effected by <br/>\na choice to quit, that needs to be considered before quitting. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s certainly a timely question for me, since I just signed my<br/>\n&gt; 6-year-old up for t-ball, and it hasn&#39;t started yet.

A young boy who was walking up the street, had baseball gear on and dejectedly held a bat in one hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Baseball practice or game?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n&quot;Game.&quot; He answered, &quot;I struck outSSStwice!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Another Babe Ruth in the making, huh?&quot; I said smiling.<br/>\nHe stopped. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Babe Ruth holds a record for the most strike outs and he also held the <br/>\n record for a long time for the most home-runs. That story is used by <br/>\n motivational speakers to teach that trying hard -swinging your hardest in baseball-will cause losses and wins. If you try your best, regardless of the outcome, it is good enough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy walked a few steps, cocked his head sideways, &quot;Babe Ruth. &quot; He swung his bat with gusto and nodded as he turned to walk on home.<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\nWe don&#39;t give points for trying, for doing one&#39;s best.

At sixty- two I can&#39;t remember the details of one game I played, even when I was the hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have taken into my life is the determination to do my best and let that best be good enough.  I play to win in a sport, and I&#39;d rather play a close game, even lose, than be bored to death winning by miles.  I learned to be a good sport when I lose. I learned the value of exercise. I learned to be a kinder person. I learned to enjoy sports.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are we teaching our children by valuing winning over learning important life skills?

One thing I found to be of value is to always have a preview class.  It is quite common here in California for the enrichment classes and it does seem fair.  Sometimes the class or activity may be enjoyable but the teacher and student are not quite the right fit.  Sometimes a child&#39;s interest&#39;s change.  I try to put myself in their shoes.  I give myself permission to change my mind at times and certain interest&#39;s have passed and later renewed.  Perhaps you will be able to be credited the dollar amount for missed classes.  Sometimes the same class held at a different hour is what works.  We are currently back at a fitness gym for young ones and there was a time I felt it was just not the right class for Alex but now it seems to be the best fit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I personally have no problem with telling the truth in regard to quitting something.  It does not hold the negative impact it once did.  Once upon a time in my career not quitting ending me up in a physical situation that was detrimental.  Following our heart and our instincts is more important than worrying about what someone else might think because we quit something.  As long as we keep trying new things we are bound to come up with certain activities that we are not suited for and find ourselves quitting them.  That&#39;s ok.  I believe that taking the risk and sampling something new is the more important thing to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n Perhaps asking your son if there is another activity he would like to try instead.  Something like 4H or Boy Scouts allows a variety of activities and may help him to decide if there is something of particular interest he would like to pursue. <br/>\n<br/>\n Our family ended up stuck in a situation this past year in which we had committed to a year&#39;s contract and although not severely detrimental it was a lesson learned in only commiting to smaller chunks.  One to two months at a time is where we find our comfort level.  Best of luck to you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: quitting activities","postDate":"1081023246","msgId":19209,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNDAzMjAxNDA3LkJaT1gyODg2OS5tdGExMy5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0bjNkYys5N25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19208,"nextInTopic":19210,"prevInTime":19208,"nextInTime":19210,"topicId":19201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Brandy, It sounds like you ve already worked it out but I ll share my 2 cents.

I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any problem with quitting an activity that I sign up for that<br/>\nisn&#39;t what I thought it would be.  It&#39;s the same for the kids.  Some people<br/>\nseem to think that you&#39;ll raise kids who can&#39;t stick with anything if you<br/>\nlet them quit things they don&#39;t enjoy.  That just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids recently quit Horse 4-H.  It was a relief to me when they finally<br/>\nquit.  They dreaded the meetings and they complained about them afterwards.<br/>\nThey love horses  and they have a friend in 4-H so they expected to have a<br/>\ngood time but the classes were more about raising money and having a<br/>\nbusiness meeting than they were about horses and it was so structured that<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t get to know the other kids in the class on a personal level.  It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t what any of us expected at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls kept thinking it would get better and so they stuck with it for 7<br/>\nmonths, but it didn&#39;t get better and I was relieved when they quit.  We<br/>\nchecked out another 4-H too but the girls decided that 4-H just isn&#39;t for<br/>\nthem at this point in their lives.  We were all disappointed that 4-H wasn&#39;t<br/>\nwhat we expected, but sticking it out just because you signed up isn&#39;t going<br/>\nto fix it.  They girls still take horse back riding lessons and haven&#39;t quit<br/>\nthat because they love it.  They&#39;ve been taking riding lessons for 1.5 years<br/>\nnow.  They have the ability to stick with things they like.  If it comes<br/>\ndown to someday working a job they don&#39;t like, they&#39;ll have to decided then<br/>\nif the money they make is important enough to make up for the dislike they<br/>\nhave for the job.  If it&#39;s not, I hope they quit and find another job.  Life<br/>\nis too short to be miserable.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116677010,"authorName":"Brandy","from":"&quot;Brandy&quot; &lt;bdel99@...&gt;","profile":"bdel99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: quitting activities","postDate":"1081020652","msgId":19203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0bjNkYys5N25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFjLjU0OTAxMmNiLjJkYTA2N2MwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19202,"nextInTopic":19204,"prevInTime":19202,"nextInTime":19204,"topicId":19201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the quick reply Sandra :) It s nice to know that there are others who feel the same way about this.

Making him finish out the season is a poor choice for several reasons:  he&#39;s not likely to find he enjpys something he&#39;s forced to do; making him do something just because you paid for it sets him to feel like you feel your money is wasted on him; he&#39;s less likely to ask for something he really may enjoy (and be good at) for fear that if it&#39;s not his thing, you&#39;ll have &#39;wasted&#39; more money, and you&#39;ll just say no anyway.  All in all, forcing a kid to finish an activity that just doesn&#39;t fit him is a bad idea.  Besides, the position he&#39;s now filling might just go to some other kid who really loves baseball.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf people ask why he&#39;s not playing T-ball anymore, it&#39;s enough to say it just wasn&#39;t his thing, so you&#39;ve moved on.
