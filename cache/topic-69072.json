They had forgotten about things like utility payments and actually needing to cut firewood for the stove. Because we had an option for them, it turned into one of those funny stories people tell about youthfull mistakes, rather than becoming a hard, stressful winter for two young guys who didn&#39;t do enough planning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis past winter he had a girlfriend stay with him off and on for a few months and we were biting out tongues, hoping he&#39;d avoid a trainwreck of a relationship. She had just walked out on a husband and baby, someone Ray knows, and their families were fighting - like fisticuffs in church sort of fighting with plans to abduct the baby and all sorts of trailer-park soap-opera craziness. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She has told me<br/>\n&gt; flat out that if we&#39;d made a stink, she&#39;d have gone anyway<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For awhile, Ray&#39;s mom was really pressuring him to dump the girl and we could see him digging in his heels, standing up for her and their relationship - that was probably the scariest part, knowing that kind of pressure wouldn&#39;t help Ray but not being able to do anything to stop it. Eventually Ray cut off contact with his mom for awhile, until she agreed to drop the subject, and he finally decided he didn&#39;t want to be in that kind of soap-opera relationship on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":469646558,"authorName":"Marie de Villers","from":"&quot;Marie de Villers&quot; &lt;mdvhome@...&gt;","profile":"clydecrimini6710","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling approach for son&#39;s friend","postDate":"1347744940","msgId":69082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGszMnNiYytjdDQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDc3NDA2NTUuOTA4ODAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69081,"nextInTopic":69084,"prevInTime":69081,"nextInTime":69083,"topicId":69072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ....trying so hard not to judge, but got nervous today.

We just have 1 son.  He went to school to grade 4, then we homeschooled, and for that last few years we&#39;ve being giving him as much freedom/choice as we can once we discovered unschooling.  We&#39;ve been to a few unschooling conferences, but still consider ourselves &quot;new&quot; and figuring things out as we go along.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our son is very happy, it seems.  He has always been a bit anxious, so loves being at home, not big on change or going out.  But he has made a big leap/change over the past week.  He called about and started a job this week.  And he went to see a movie with a girl he met on-line.  He was dropped off at both places (work and theatre), which is a big deal for him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After the movie night, we talked and wanted to make sure he knew that we were fine if she wanted to come over sometime, that she was welcome here.  So he asked if she could come to our cottage with us this week-end and stay overnight.  We told him that she could come during the day, but that we weren&#39;t comfortable with her staying the night just yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband & son picked her up this am.  My husband was very uncomfortable with the situation.  2 of the girl&#39;s brothers (in their 20&#39;s) were around & whispering to Sam and then yelling at him when they were leaving to use &quot;herpes cream&quot;.  The father was there, but looks like this is normal for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are just trying to keep the lines of communication open with our son.  He has never had a girlfriend before.

Looks like we are quite opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of lifestyle from her family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband and I are both a little stressed out.

Girlfriends sometimes come with dirty-mouthed brothers and sisters. Your son might need some reassurance that potty-mouth teasing is something siblings do. In a way, it&#39;s defensive: &quot;are you cool enough for our sister? Even if we&#39;re total jerks to you?&quot; It could even be a way of saying &quot;don&#39;t mess with our little sister: we&#39;re watching you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to see it that way - sweet and mixed with years of living together and pushing each others buttons.

But don&#39;t expect to know EVERYthing about this girl or their relationship.  Don&#39;t ask too many questions.   There will be things he doesn&#39;t want to talk about, possibly.  Probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis dichotomy concerns me, in your thinking:  <br/>\n-=- We want to find the balance of giving him freedom and providing support/parenting. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Giving freedom&quot; isn&#39;t nearly as useful a concept as &quot;helping learn to make good choices.<br/>\nI hope you don&#39;t really think that parenting is the opposite of allowing choices, or that providing support is the opposite of &quot;giving freedom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We have been unshooling for a few years now.

I wasn&#39;t a sneaky kids, but there were times and places where I could be alone with a boy, and I usually had a boyfriend.  Movies in those days were often drive-in theaters, too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kept parents from being stressed out was they didn&#39;t usually know anything about what was going on.    So having chosen to be so close a part of your son&#39;s life, it will help if you can guard against smothering him while he&#39;s becoming a man.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":469646558,"authorName":"Marie de Villers","from":"&quot;Marie de Villers&quot; &lt;mdvhome@...&gt;","profile":"clydecrimini6710","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling approach for son&#39;s friend","postDate":"1347728740","msgId":69072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGszMmNoNCtia3J2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69074,"prevInTime":69071,"nextInTime":69073,"topicId":69072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to ask for some thoughts on how to approach the situation of son s (15 yrs old)new girl friend, or perhaps just a friend .

He has always been a bit anxious, so loves being at home, not big on change or going out.  But he has made a big leap/change over the past week.  He called about and started a job this week.  And he went to see a movie with a girl he met on-line.  He was dropped off at both places (work and theatre), which is a big deal for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the movie night, we talked and wanted to make sure he knew that we were fine if she wanted to come over sometime, that she was welcome here.  So he asked if she could come to our cottage with us this week-end and stay overnight.  We told him that she could come during the day, but that we weren&#39;t comfortable with her staying the night just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband & son picked her up this am.  My husband was very uncomfortable with the situation.  2 of the girl&#39;s brothers (in their 20&#39;s) were around & whispering to Sam and then yelling at him when they were leaving to use &quot;herpes cream&quot;.  The father was there, but looks like this is normal for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are just trying to keep the lines of communication open with our son.  He has never had a girlfriend before.
