The state doesn&#39;t accredit  <br/>\nanybody - not even public schools - and the diploma from any school  <br/>\nreally says NOTHING except that the student has met the graduation  <br/>\nrequirements of THAT school - accredited or not. The state doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nissue the diplomas, nor approve them - nothing. It does say in the  <br/>\nstate education code what the minimum requirements are that the  <br/>\npublic schools have to set for graduation requirements - but the  <br/>\nschools can and do add to those minimum requirements. The state has  <br/>\nNOTHING to say about what the requirements are for graduation from  <br/>\nprivate schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools here can apply for accreditation from any of a number of  <br/>\ndifference accreditation agencies - they are ALL private agencies,  <br/>\nnot government-related. Lots of private schools are not accredited by  <br/>\nanybody. Lots of others are accredited by very specialized  <br/>\naccreditation organizations such as the NLSA - National Lutheran  <br/>\nSchool Accreditation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWASC - the Western Association of Schools and Colleges is the  <br/>\norganization that accredits most public schools here. There are other  <br/>\nlarge regional accreditation agencies in other parts of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some states, like New Mexico, I believe, the state, itself,  <br/>\naccredits schools (based on recommendations from various  <br/>\naccreditation agencies or commissions) - including non-public schools  <br/>\nthat seek accreditation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit of accreditation is that one accredited school will  <br/>\nnormally accept all high school credits from another accredited  <br/>\nschool. Students transferring from a non-accredited high school to an  <br/>\naccredited high school MAY find that the new school will not accept  <br/>\nany or all of their credits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s really the only aspect of accreditation that matters, as far  <br/>\nas I have ever been able to tell. Other than that a school that gets  <br/>\nturned down for accreditation typically gets a bad reputation - bad  <br/>\npress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are probably exceptions somewhere, but colleges don&#39;t  <br/>\ntypically care about accreditation, because they look directly at  <br/>\nwhat the student has really done - what courses he/she has taken -  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t rely on the student being a &quot;high school graduate&quot; to  <br/>\nassume any particular body of study.  The UC system, in California,  <br/>\nrequires that high schools get their courses pre-approved by the UC  <br/>\nsystem, in order for students applying as freshmen to a UC to count  <br/>\ntheir high school courses toward meeting the entrance requirements.  <br/>\nThis is not the same as &quot;accreditation&quot; although people occasionally  <br/>\nmistakenly use that terminology for it. It does make it more  <br/>\ndifficult for students in small private schools (such as  <br/>\nhomeschoolers) and definitely harder for unschoolers who don&#39;t &quot;take  <br/>\ncourses&quot; anyway - to be accepted as freshmen into a University of  <br/>\nCalifornia. There are ways around it - high SAT scores, for example,  <br/>\nand the most common way is to take classes at a community college and  <br/>\ntransfer in, rather than applying as a freshman. (Note to  <br/>\nCalifornians: the UC System means University of California - UCLA, UC  <br/>\nBerkeley, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, UC  <br/>\nDavis, etc. There is a whole other state university system - Cal  <br/>\nState University Long Beach, CSU San Diego, CSU Fullerton, San Jose  <br/>\nState, San Francisco State, Fresno State, etc. The latter system does  <br/>\nNOT require the pre-approved high school courses like the UC system  <br/>\ndoes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I would<br/>\n&gt; have to think a long time and know more about what it takes to get a<br/>\n&gt; diploma from an unaccredited school in this state to feel comfortable<br/>\n&gt; about saying &quot;graduated,&quot; because even though I know it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt; much, it seems to mean SOMEthing.

I said &quot;We didn&#39;t  <br/>\nraise them to live at home,&quot; once when we were talking about how  <br/>\nsparkly Kirby is when he&#39;s away from home and how dull and boring he  <br/>\nis sometimes when it&#39;s just family.    So we use it, but not in a   <br/>\nmainstream way, and not without knowing we&#39;ve done it.  Not  <br/>\nthoughtlessly, I think I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t talk about grades or graduating.  When people talk about  <br/>\nKirby we say &quot;He&#39;s 19, he&#39;s working at Dion&#39;s, he&#39;s teaching  <br/>\nkarate...&quot; stuff like that.  Had he gone to high school he probably  <br/>\nwould have graduated last year, but there are kids his age (boys  <br/>\nmostly) who failed a year (first grade mostly) who are still in high  <br/>\nschool at his age (poor guys).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you about &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;graduated&quot; being problematical.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Hmmmm, &quot;RAISING and I GRADUATED&quot;","postDate":"1136090902","msgId":23636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVmOTRjNTRjY2RhNzBhYzRhYzgxN2YyNjU2NWQ0MGQwQGNveC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM2MGU2YSQ4OWQ3ZWViMCQwYTAwYThjMEBzb3V0aHN5c3RlbXM+","referencesHeader":"PDExMzYwNjAzMzguMzcyMC42NjE3Lm0xOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDIyMDFjNjBlNmEkODlkN2VlYjAkMGEwMGE4YzBAc291dGhzeXN0ZW1zPg=="},"prevInTopic":23633,"nextInTopic":23638,"prevInTime":23635,"nextInTime":23637,"topicId":23633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
