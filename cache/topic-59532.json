A couple of things I&#39;m not sure of/nuances to this situation. First, I&#39;m not really sure if she expects a response. Although, she did send an article about a different topic in the mail and when my husband and I didn&#39;t mention it, she ended up texting my husband to ask about it (if we read it? if we got it? not sure...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m pretty sure that a lot of this has been spurred by a family incident from around the holidays - I&#39;ll try to keep it short but give enough information to give an idea of the situation. We were with my husband&#39;s family for about 4 days surrounding Christmas and overall things went well. On the last day there was a blow up between him and his older sister though. A few days after we got home we sent an email to the whole family addressing the blow up and thoughts and feelings we have about how our parenting/life decisions don&#39;t seem to be received well all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, there was a lot of fallout from that communication and things are not really &quot;resolved&quot;. A positive for me is that I have had a lot of communication with his family. However, my husband is not really communicating with either his parents or sisters and doesn&#39;t really feel there is an issue even though they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nwell this isn&#39;t so short! I guess what I am saying, is that I think this is partly why his mom is sending things like this so I&#39;m not sure what the best response is yet. Mike already wrote a one-liner back which I&#39;m not sure was the greatest - something to the extent that we only &quot;consume healthy media&quot; in our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the biggest issue right now is that I am going to a training in a few weeks and it will be my daughter&#39;s and my first separation (that is more than a few hours) ever (she will be 4 years old and 8 months the day I leave). Mike&#39;s Mom is coming for about 4 or the 5+ days to keep them company. I&#39;m worried that if we don&#39;t address some things before (like TV watching) it will be more stressful than helpful for everyone involved. She really is quite good about not trying to impose her ideas, so I&#39;m wondering if a gentle communication or headsup that we&#39;re ok with Marisol watching what she wants when for the most part would be helpful... <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to post separately about some thoughts/feelings I am having about my training/separation from my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think she&#39;ll Expect a response?
