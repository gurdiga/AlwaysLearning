They’re really good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty could roller skate the day I bought him Fisher Price skates, so the next day we got him real roller blades, and he skated away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Holly came along the relatives were more confidence already, so I don’t remember bragging about Holly as much.  But when she was 16, she wanted to work in a flower shop near here, and couldn’t figure out how to  apply.  I wrote a letter for her to take over there saying she was homeschooled and great with making things like flower fairies (maybe I sent photos with it, I don’t remember), and if the owner would be willing to let her help out during an upcoming busy season (May:  Mother’s Day, high school proms, Memorial Day), I would be willing to pay them and it could be school credit for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead they hired her.  So that was bragging (me to the store owner) that led to another brag (for the relatives), but she was nearly grown by then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341538868,"authorName":"Kelly Callahan","from":"Kelly Callahan &lt;ridgelife@...&gt;","profile":"kellycallahancch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: My parents worry","postDate":"1497920670","msgId":78090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSzhRZjVfMkRzVU89RGFXSFhhcmpHblRZcWF6QXN4SnF5OTR5VUFpYk9wb3ZkTnQzUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJDMjhCOTlCLUQ5MzItNDZEMy04M0Y0LTI1MDYyOUYzNDQzN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6Q2E4MFE9LVhZMTZ6RnFoSFU9VkhnT3k0Tj1GeXBUa0RTTnItPXZRb2hUd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPG9pOGVsZisxZjlrdDZrQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBUHYrY1l3d21ZX2p5ZXFZLVBxV1hxSEZKKzlEM0cycHQtV1dkT0M2akpURVNtLWMwUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEJDMjhCOTlCLUQ5MzItNDZEMy04M0Y0LTI1MDYyOUYzNDQzN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78089,"nextInTopic":78091,"prevInTime":78089,"nextInTime":78091,"topicId":78078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It helps me to remember how long it took me to move past different stages of worry...how much reading, thinking, watching, reading... even giving one or two","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1892864828\"><div dir=\"ltr\">It helps me to remember how long it took me to move past different stages of worry...how much reading, thinking, watching, reading... even giving one or two books to a grandparent doesn&#39;t equal the amount of time it takes one to deschool.

Pam Laracchia also interviews Shelia on one of her podcasts, that&#39;s how I found out about the book, which is a great episode to listen to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law was concerned about what we were doing, and didn&#39;t really quite understand it. She also, like most people, &quot;is made of school&quot; (Sandra&#39;s phrase that  I love!) and raised 10 children and put them all through the school system, so I think she never really knew what to ask about my children and often had trouble connecting with them/us, because we do things so differently than she is used to. She read the Dear Grandma book in one night and she came to me the very next day chatty and positive and even saying she wished she had know about Unschooling when her kids were young. I think those books opened the door for all of us to start being able to talk openly about what we are doing because they now have some background on the lifestyle. Without it there was fear, ignorance and assumptions.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky","from":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My parents worry","postDate":"1497846809","msgId":78084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2NjU5Q0JFLTA1OEUtNDVEMy05NkIzLUVDQTE0Qzc3RjhFMUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ1NzRCMUI4LTMyREMtNEM1RC1CRkZELTZFOTQ2ODkyMzY1MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6Q2E4MFE9LVhZMTZ6RnFoSFU9VkhnT3k0Tj1GeXBUa0RTTnItPXZRb2hUd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDQyODhDRURCLTdFRkUtNEM3NC1BNEUwLTkwM0UzREU2QzQxMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDY1Njg5NzQzLUVCMzItNDc0QS1CMEIzLTM5QUYxNzhCMDY3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEQ1NzRCMUI4LTMyREMtNEM1RC1CRkZELTZFOTQ2ODkyMzY1MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78083,"nextInTopic":78085,"prevInTime":78083,"nextInTime":78085,"topicId":78078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
