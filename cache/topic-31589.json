I&#39;ve poked  <br/>\naround for years but it&#39;s beyond my understanding, still.   (Being  <br/>\nancient, I could probably write one in Basic, and .... and that would  <br/>\nbe the end of that. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA local friend offered to make me one last December and it&#39;s nearly  <br/>\nthis December and she&#39;s busy, so I&#39;m begging out in public again.   <br/>\n(THANK YOU, all of those of you who haven&#39;t made me feel like such a  <br/>\nbeggar.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I&#39;m begging, if any of you saved quotes or printed them and  <br/>\nstuck them on the refrigerator or the bathroom mirror or something  <br/>\nand you think others should have them too, please let me know.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s a link on that quotes page, or you could respond here, or at  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31569,"nextTopicId":31583}}
