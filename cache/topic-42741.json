The tupperware thing looks<br/>\ngreat, if the lid is easy enough to get off without spilling stuff inside<br/>\n(for young kids).  But one day we&#39;ll leave it out and leave the house, or<br/>\njust go in the basement and my dogs will chew it up to get at whatever&#39;s<br/>\ninside -- including celery and stupid not yummy for dogs food like that.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nA glass cake stand would be good, except the dome would be too heavy and<br/>\nunwieldy for a young kid.  And I have really stupid ceramic tile floors that<br/>\nare death to lots of glass stuff too.  We moved in about 1.5 years ago and<br/>\nhave broken SO many dishes it&#39;s not even funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve figured out to get the glass Pyrex dishes with plastic lids because I<br/>\ncan order them separately, so when we break a dish or the dogs get the lids,<br/>\nI can order them individually -- annoying, but better than having lots of<br/>\nmismatched food storage stuff.  Been there, done that.  :)  Plus I like the<br/>\nglass in that situation because I often microwave them and prefer to<br/>\nmicrowave in glass rather than plastic.  My kids can NOT easily get the lids<br/>\noff these containers though, so they don&#39;t work either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are fine -- we have found workarounds that involves the kids eating in<br/>\nthe kitchen more often than not.  They can get water for themselves, and can<br/>\nopen the fridge/freezer too.  At least that limits what the dogs get to what<br/>\nthe kids leave after eating and I don&#39;t see quickly enough to put away.  If<br/>\nmy kids want to take food elsewhere, I try to close them in a room or close<br/>\nthe dogs in another room.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have really nice, friendly, sometimes rambunctious dogs that we clicker<br/>\ntrained (sort of...)  and were a HUGE part of what brought me towards AP and<br/>\nunschooling!  I owe those dogs a lot, and my kids owe them even more because<br/>\nmy husband and I practiced on them before we ever had kids!  :)  What I&#39;d<br/>\nREALLY like is a less open house with a kitchen I could close off completely<br/>\nso our pets could be kept out of there altogether.  And a different floor...<br/>\nMaybe someday!  At least the way it is now we can sit at a counter in the<br/>\nkitchen and look straight at our big TV.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-emiLy, mom to Delia (5) & Henry (1.5)<br/>\nThe EC Store<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.TheECstore.com\">http://www.TheECstore.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/28/09 9:41 AM, &quot;k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katherand@...\">katherand@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about something like this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Three-Stay-Suction-3-Pack/dp/B000JOT2RO/ref\">http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Three-Stay-Suction-3-Pack/dp/B000JOT2RO/ref</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =pd_sim_ba_6 or like this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tupperware-Meal-Solutions-Go-Pack/dp/B00025X2YO/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/Tupperware-Meal-Solutions-Go-Pack/dp/B00025X2YO/ref=</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sr_1_95?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1235834060&sr=1-95<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ck2mxa)\">http://tinyurl.com/ck2mxa)</a> Oh, this one&#39;s better:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tupperware-Serving-Center-Set-Raspberry-Red/dp/B0006\">http://www.amazon.com/Tupperware-Serving-Center-Set-Raspberry-Red/dp/B0006</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IC0Z4/ref=pd_sbs_hg_1 or this one:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Prodyne-APPETIZERS-ICE-Lids-AB-5-L/dp/B000UMK9QS/ref=pd_\">http://www.amazon.com/Prodyne-APPETIZERS-ICE-Lids-AB-5-L/dp/B000UMK9QS/ref=pd_</a><br/>\n&gt; sbs_hg_3<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And....
