He just turned 16.  He was adopted  as an infant, was a 27 week premie which might account for his inability to articulate certain sounds.      I didn&#39;t learn about unschooling til he was 9 or so; he was in school til then.  (Fortunately, we traveled alot and took school kind of lightly, but when he was in  school they gave him regular speech therapy) <br/>\n<br/>\nSince beginning unschooling I&#39;ve not sought out therapy or any circumstance to improve his speech; both because he hasn&#39;t asked and it didn&#39;t seem to help him when he was in it.    I  ask him to repeat things sometimes, or say I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get that . . . I don&#39;t pretend that I understand him when I don&#39;t.   <br/>\n <br/>\nDan will talk about his speech impediment, (his words) as embarrassing and sometimes getting in his way.   He leans towards texting and email alot to communicate with friends (but so do my other kids).  I&#39;m noticing that he slows his speech down on the phone and with new people.  It seems to go in phases, too, there&#39;s weeks when he&#39;s  harder to understand and then weeks when he&#39;s pretty clear.   <br/>\n<br/>\n He interviewed for a paid internship at a museum and had to answer questions publicly to all the other people (teens, curators, etc) in the program.  He began by talking about his difficulties with his speech.  He said it was his weakness and his strength.   Apparently it started a few other people in the group &quot;admitting&quot; to early speech therapy and being embarrassed about speech issues.   He was selected for the job, but decided after two weeks that  it wasn&#39;t what he wanted to do.  It could have been because he was going to have to tour people through the museum and talk to the public, but the overall shape and duties of the internship were unclear as well; he decided not to continue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t  suggest things that he might &quot;do&quot; to improve his speech although I do think about it so I have ideas at the ready should he ask for help specifically ( coaching in diction; pre- broadcasting coaching,  mouth exercises, using straws, blow-pens, popsicles, push-ups,  learning tongue twisters,  to learning auctioneering . . .(!) )<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s been a tender balance - from a  matter of factness when I don&#39;t understand him, to  just being available to say, yeah, it sucks sometimes, to  having these ideas at the ready,  to most importantly  focusing on his strengths and interests. <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: speech","postDate":"1164376216","msgId":27352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhCNkQzRDZDLUFFMTktNENGQy05QjAyLUUyQUQ1NTM1ODEyMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI2NTMyQUNFLTY4NDAtNDg1MC1CRTlELTMxQTM2RTFGMzIxMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGVrNWg5NCthNmM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QjY1MzJBQ0UtNjg0MC00ODUwLUJFOUQtMzFBMzZFMUYzMjExQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27351,"nextInTopic":43462,"prevInTime":27351,"nextInTime":27353,"topicId":27310,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope you all repaired my writing in your heads...

I guess I got off <br/>\n<br/>\nthe subject of speech didn&#39;t I? My point? I think, from what I&#39;ve <br/>\n<br/>\nread, that speech delay seems to be more common than I realized for <br/>\n<br/>\nsure. I think perhaps my staying home w/ my son since birth and <br/>\n<br/>\nknowing him so well allows him to do many things &#39;in his own time&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nand speaking is one of them. I know what he wants 95% of the time <br/>\n<br/>\nand so it&#39;s not been an issue. I suppose I&#39;ll take him to the <br/>\n<br/>\ntherapy and see how it goes. I&#39;ve only recently (in the past few <br/>\n<br/>\nweeks) decided to unschool/homeschool my kids [took me a long time <br/>\n<br/>\nto come to that decision, as you can imagine my MIL is not thrilled <br/>\n<br/>\nor supportive] and, since I no longer have school looming on the <br/>\n<br/>\nhorizon like a dark cloud, I am not as worried about it as I was. I <br/>\n<br/>\nknow he&#39;ll talk sometime, in his own time. I just try and let that <br/>\n<br/>\nbe enough for me.

I am <br/>\nnew to the unschooling concept, but realize that I&#39;ve been <br/>\npracticing it all along. (I also have a two yr old girl) I generally <br/>\njust play with the kids, cook with the kids, take the kids with me <br/>\nwhere I go, sleep (co-sleep) with the kids etc... It&#39;s driven my MIL <br/>\nkind of crazy, &#39;cause I think she thinks I am too &#39;attached&#39; to them <br/>\nand honestly I think she blames this for my son&#39;s speech delay... <br/>\nSince having discovered this posting board and others, I am feeling <br/>\nmuch more comfortable in my own skin as a Mommy. I guess I got off <br/>\nthe subject of speech didn&#39;t I? My point? I think, from what I&#39;ve <br/>\nread, that speech delay seems to be more common than I realized for <br/>\nsure. I think perhaps my staying home w/ my son since birth and <br/>\nknowing him so well allows him to do many things &#39;in his own time&#39; <br/>\nand speaking is one of them. I know what he wants 95% of the time <br/>\nand so it&#39;s not been an issue. I suppose I&#39;ll take him to the <br/>\ntherapy and see how it goes. I&#39;ve only recently (in the past few <br/>\nweeks) decided to unschool/homeschool my kids [took me a long time <br/>\nto come to that decision, as you can imagine my MIL is not thrilled <br/>\nor supportive] and, since I no longer have school looming on the <br/>\nhorizon like a dark cloud, I am not as worried about it as I was. I <br/>\nknow he&#39;ll talk sometime, in his own time. I just try and let that <br/>\nbe enough for me. I don&#39;t know if any of that helped, but I am up w/ <br/>\ninsomnia so hopefully something coherent will have come out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmiles, <br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;laura g&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;***I am not sure how my statement would indicate that I am more <br/>\nconcerned<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her than my son.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;This is how:   &quot;I cant just let him descide each week as this <br/>\ntherapist <br/>\n&gt; gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt;paid when she sees him and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not when she doesnt so we have to either commit to it or not.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It sounds like you care more about how the therapist feels about <br/>\na missed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;week than you care about letting your son choose which weeks to <br/>\ngo.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yea, i can see that..thanks for pointing that out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;You could pay the therapist for weeks he misses.

Anyway, back to speech,  so since i told him <br/>\nto let me know cause he doesnt have to do these things he told me he <br/>\ndoesnt like to go to speech.  but he went.
