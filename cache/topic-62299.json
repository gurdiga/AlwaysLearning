That would be fun&quot; or &quot; yeah I wish we could&quot; but brightly and kindly. Sometimes we play a game building wild fantasies about what I would grow on trees if I could, like wii games and chocolate bars. It&#39;s fun and silly and they totally get into it. I ask them what they would grow on trees and we can imagine are the trees just for us or are they trees for everone, etc.  It&#39;s a playful way to ease out of a sad or whiny conversation about what we don&#39;t have or cant get right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in Chicago, currently housebound with a busted leg so dealing with quite alot of &quot;can&#39;ts&quot; this summer<br/>\nZibby 7<br/>\nHenry 3<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 10, 2011, at 2:18 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; feel I want to be sympathetic.
