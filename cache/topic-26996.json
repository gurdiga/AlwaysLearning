After astonishment, my next reaction is <br/>\nsadness - they are <br/>\nhomeschooling because they &#39;have to&#39; and there seems no pleasure <br/>\nin it - other than a sense of smug righteousness perhaps!---<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, I have been asked a lot by non-homeschoolers about why I <br/>\nhomeschool our three boys.  We live in a school district which is <br/>\nlauded for its test scores and general quality of education.  As my <br/>\noldest gets older (10yo), people become more perplexed.  Some of the <br/>\nmost recent remarks that leave me shaking my head are:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You must be a saint.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Wow, what alot of work THAT must be.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, I&#39;m in the school almost every day, so I stay involved that <br/>\nway.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t get my 1st grader to do her 15 minutes of homework, how can <br/>\nyou homeschool?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I could NEVER do that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, most people assume that I do school-at-home.  Many people <br/>\nassume I am a Christian homeschooler.  When I tell them that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t, and that I&#39;m not, that usually leads to the question about <br/>\nhow could I spend all day with them and still be sane.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is starting to bother me.  The kids are playing some organized <br/>\nsoccer so there&#39;s lots of these random remarks at the sidelines.  <br/>\nAny snappy comebacks come to mind?  I don&#39;t necessarily want to push <br/>\npeople away, but they feel free to give me a litany of reasons why <br/>\nthey choose to send Johnny to school. It&#39;s as if they have to <br/>\nexplain themselves so I know that they are righteous, good caring <br/>\nparents too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReally, any thoughts would be welcome.  I&#39;m tired of smiling and <br/>\nnodding.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Christa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] pleasure in and respect for kids (was french or no french)","postDate":"1158541453","msgId":27001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU5RDhGRUZDLTM1QUEtNDFEMC05MzhCLTI4MTYxNDMzODA1RkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEY4RDE3M0I1LUM5MDEtNDAyMC04QTM3LUU2MkY3NkUzRTZBQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ0QThEQTkzLTIyMDMtNDQxQi1CQjJBLTk4MkQ4RDFDQ0IzQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDQ1MENENjYyLjcwMTAwMDNAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4gPDU2MjY3MDkzLTMxQTktNEJGMS05RjU4LTFEOTZFMEQxRkFFRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAwYTUwMWM2ZGE4NSRlNDI2Yzc1MCQ3YTRlNjBkNEBjaGV6MjMwZDVmMzNkMj4gPEJDODJGNzhBLTExNEYtNDYyQi1CNEZBLUZEN0Y0N0IzNjFFQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDQ1MEREOTE4LjQwNDAzMDVAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4gPEY4RDE3M0I1LUM5MDEtNDAyMC04QTM3LUU2MkY3NkUzRTZBQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26999,"nextInTopic":27005,"prevInTime":27000,"nextInTime":27002,"topicId":26996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-No, one of the badmouthingest of them shot back quickly TRUST ME, this child is not the second coming, -=- I JUST REMEMBERED.

So one day I started a  <br/>\ntopic called &quot;Heathen Homeschoolers,&quot; to discuss the problems of  <br/>\nsecular homeschoolers.  It got 90 posts in just half a day, and 60 or  <br/>\nmore were from Christians just cranky that anyone would use a word  <br/>\nlike &quot;heathen&quot; on what they clearly saw as their message board.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why when AOL&#39;s expansive-like-a-mall message areas came  <br/>\navailable there was finally, for the first time, a separate place for  <br/>\nunschoolers to discuss unschooling.   It was fantastic.   Not as good  <br/>\nas what we have now, but it didn&#39;t suck.
