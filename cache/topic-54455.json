This post distills some of my own thinking<br/>\nthis week. One of my biggest hurdles is getting over the childhood I<br/>\nhad, not resenting it. Since it&#39;s in the past, of course it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmove or change and I&#39;m the one who can decide how I view it and what I<br/>\nwant to do with this present moment despite (or because of) things in<br/>\nthe past.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the fact that I could just as easily NOT put the two together,<br/>\npast and present, as to connect them. I could load up the past, an<br/>\namoebic invisible nonentitiy, with all sorts of blame. I could also<br/>\nsee it as done with and not at all to blame for the present, even<br/>\nwhile acknowledging that pieces of past events have effected the<br/>\npresent as I ALSO realize that I can&#39;t necessarily pinpoint all the<br/>\ncauses and their implications. Some things may never be back-tracked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ok that much of my life continues to be filled with unknowns,<br/>\neven as I learn more and more everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it&#39;s about accepting what is.
