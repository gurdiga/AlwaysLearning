I&#39;ve asked Casey, but she no longer remembers any of <br/>\nit. I think dreams are a good avenue to the subconscious and perhap memories <br/>\nof the past. Maybe I should listen even more closely to her dreams. Lately <br/>\nshe&#39;s been having recurring dreams that involve a whale/shark that is <br/>\nthreatening her. Hmmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If she gets interested in past life regression it would be interesting to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;see if more of it comes out.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah. I&#39;ll probably have to wait until she gets older, though. Although with <br/>\nCasey, you never can tell. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have a friend who&#39;s BIG into that--she&#39;s a professional psychic, and she <br/>\n&gt;&gt;cares SO much I can&#39;t keep a straight face.  It usually seems bogus and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;worthless to me, and bad things to remember (we have enough grief and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;angst from a single life without the burden of others) but then I hear <br/>\n&gt;&gt;stories like this about Casey and a shiver goes down me and I remember how <br/>\n&gt;&gt;exciting those stories are.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For Jon&#39;s last birthday, I gave him a reading with a local intuitive <br/>\nreader/psychic. He asked if she had any feeling as to why he keeps <br/>\nchanging/losing jobs every 2-3 years like clockwork. It&#39;s a definite pattern <br/>\nin our lives. She told him that in a past life he was a stonemason. He built <br/>\ncastles in medieval times. He had a lot of independence in this line of work <br/>\n(for the times) so is not used to being tied down to one workplace. When the <br/>\ncastle is done, you move on to a new place. Interesting. It certainly would <br/>\nhelp to explain all the rock collections he has around our house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Damn me and my monkey curiosity to hell.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just the other night a friend was commenting that inserting the word monkey <br/>\ninto any statement makes it immediately funny and outrageous at the same <br/>\ntime. She was from Texas originally.
