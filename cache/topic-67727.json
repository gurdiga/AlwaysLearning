But asking the mirror to only show what a person wants to change doesn&#39;t help them or the next person who uses the mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd part of what this list does is act exactly like a mirror. Responders reflect back what they see in someone&#39;s words: what they say, how they say it, what they don&#39;t say. People expose their fat rolls without even realizing it. ;-) And the intent is to reflect it back to everyone who is reading and trying to grow their understanding by what&#39;s reflected, not just the original poster.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is to not block your son, to support him in exploring what intrigues him about the world, you *want* to see what *he* sees in how you&#39;re reacting to him, which thoughtful, analytical willing strangers can see better than you. Often what someone else sees is so far from our intent that it makes us defensive and angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is to protect who you imagine yourself to be it&#39;s best to avoid mirrors and this list. If you want to change to help him, this is is an awesome place to get objective feedback on what might be getting in the way of your unschooling goals. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s been an extremely stressful time as we&#39;ve watched<br/>\n&gt; our son who used to be the active, creative, energetic, joyful kid<br/>\n&gt; become sullen, sedentary, angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All of those are good warning signs that something is wrong and they&#39;re good to be alert for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you focus on his choice as being the cause rather than his solution to something else that&#39;s going on, it will make it harder for you to support him in exploring other solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst he&#39;s 12. That&#39;s a *very* typical age for kids to be drawn to computers, video games and  tween shows on TV. It&#39;s a transition period between kids interests and more social interests and those match what they&#39;re exploring. They&#39;re gearing up for a big growth spurt so they do tend to chunk up. (Hang out at a middle school -- without being creepy ;-) -- and see all the chunky kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, games empower kids to tackle hugely challenging problems they can&#39;t in real life. It&#39;s hard for someone who doesn&#39;t play to get what&#39;s going on. From the outside it looks like they&#39;re addicted. But from the inside it is exactly like tackling a fascinating multi-faceted problem *and* -- importantly! -- having the power to solve it. Kids *want* to tackle big problems just as much as adults do. But the problem is they don&#39;t have the power to do so. They aren&#39;t taken seriously. They&#39;re deliberately hobbled to protect them. Games give them the problems and the power to solve them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, games are *hugely* involving puzzles. That means it&#39;s hard to tear yourself away to do boring things like eating. ;-) And going to the bathroom. At 12 he can probably do that better than a 6 yo, but still he&#39;ll wait until he can&#39;t stand it any more. And with eating he&#39;s more likely to grab what ever is quickest. You can make it easier by bringing him food and making nutritiously dense food that he enjoys easy to grab.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy being sensitive to how important the games are to him, how empowering they are, that can help you find ways for him to play AND do other things.

For full disclosure, our daughter was diagnosed this year, so you likely have far more experience than we do in that area; I debated replying to this thread all day because we&#39;re so new to diabetes, but we&#39;re not new to unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to reply because I can say with confidence that our unschooling is not at all effected by the fact that our daughter&#39;s pancreas doesn&#39;t make it&#39;s own insulin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was in the hospital, one of the doctors said, &quot;Child first, diabetes second&quot; when talking to us about food and activity choices.  I think that&#39;s excellent advice.  The other thing he said was, &quot;If you&#39;d have said yes before diabetes, then that yes shouldn&#39;t change.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son&#39;s condition comes with a whole host of constantly reoccurring daily annoyances that will remain with him either until he dies, or there is a cure.  Don&#39;t make that burden heavier by using his bum pancreas as a reason to despair his choices. Diabetes sucks enough on its own without it also being used as a reason for mom freaking out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome practical ideas: Look into getting him a continuous blood glucose monitor (I just did a ton of research on the two brands available in the US.  Feel free to email me off list if you&#39;d like some of my favorite reviews/sources).  That will give both of you the added security of low alarms when he&#39;s alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet him a cell phone, or one for yourself so he can call you to help figure out his doses.  Pre-measure foods for him before you leave and leave a list with carb counts so he can grab and dose accordingly without having to weigh and calculate. Does he pump?  Two of the three pumps have food and custom indexes you can program, which would also give him added independence in dosing when you&#39;re out. If he&#39;s on multiple daily injections and isn&#39;t comfortable injecting on his own, check out the i-port. It would totally depend on his ability as to whether or not I&#39;d be comfortable with him filling his own syringes--if you don&#39;t think he can do so safely, you could pre fill them for him, or use insulin pens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as exercise, yea, it&#39;s important to move around. Chances are though, he already moves around more than most kids who sit in a classroom for 6-8 hours a day. Do you have a Wii? Trampoline? Place to swim? I think it&#39;s would also be helpful to realize that even if he&#39;s in a place where he&#39;s not excited to do lots of physical things *right now*, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll be like that forever. I would think that as he begins to assume more responsibility for his care, that he&#39;ll also find ways to give his body what it needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n----The lack of activity is also extremely bad for him because of the diabetes.----<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying that to him?  If so, stop.  The massive changes in diabetes care (for Type 1&#39;s) in the past 15 years means that it is very unlikely that he will ever suffer serious complications like loss of vision or kidney function. Don&#39;t forget that many of the 50 year old type 1&#39;s who&#39;ve had the disease since they were children, only started tested their blood glucose more than once a day within the past 15 years.  Background insulins are only about 10 years old! Let him be a kid. Don&#39;t add the weight of potential complications to his life, now. He could get hit by a bus tomorrow. A relatively sedentary year of his life does not condemn him to complications. Make moving around fun and attractive, but leave it at that. If you&#39;re shouldering the majority of his care, carb counting and insulin dosing, his A1C is probably respectable. Leave it at that, for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hospital where our daughter was diagnosed and where we went through &#39;boot camp,&quot; conducted a huge long-term outcomes study a few years ago. What they found was the kids with the best outcomes through teen years and into adulthood were the ones whose (surprise surprise) families took on diabetes management as a team. The kids who fared the worst, had parents who either handed all responsibility over to the kids, as in &quot;your disease, you take care of it&quot; or the ones who controlled everything and made everything about diabetes.  Those were the kids who became teens who would lie about food, dosing, blood glucose readings or who would pretend they just didn&#39;t have diabetes anymore and stop using insulin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do, don&#39;t let his lack of beta cells be a reason not to unschool. I promise, unschooling makes the crappiness of diabetes a whole lot less crappy.

Sometimes life balances out over a longer term - when you have a new baby life isn&#39;t very balanced. A lot of time and energy and interest and attention is tied up in that new baby, but babies don&#39;t stay that intensive. Grown children take very little time and energy, so over a couple decades a sort of balance is achieved. It can help to think about a new passion as being like a new baby - it&#39;s going to be the center of the world for awhile, and that&#39;s not a bad thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the underlying issues is that children aren&#39;t expected to have passions - it&#39;s even seen as something indecent or undesirable. There&#39;s a lot of emphasis on creating a &quot;well rounded&quot; education for kids, but that doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with human nature or how people learn! Passion is an aspect of human nature that&#39;s tied directly into how we learn about the world. It&#39;s natural for people to dive in head first to learn. The educational goal of the well rounded curriculum is due to the fact that education is by nature narrower than natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the course of natural learning, all sorts of tangential topics and ideas and skills become a part of what is learned - information swirls and eddies and makes unexpected connections. People who play multi-player games often learn a lot about social relationships, group dynamics, even things like economics and politics. Back when my stepson was playing Runescape on a daily basis, he learned a lot about commodities, currency exchange rates, and speculation from buying and selling within the context of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He also plays Halo and many other games we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Careful of this - you&#39;ve lumped several things together and called them &quot;computer games&quot; as if they were all one thing. It helps a whooooole lot to see the variety in what he&#39;s doing, both in terms of seeing what he&#39;s doing more clearly and in terms of calming your sense of panic. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like... I can lump my interests together and say &quot;I&#39;m a fiber artist&quot; and that sounds like one thing. But if I break it down: I sew, quilt, design, knit, spin, cross-stitch, bead, upholster, make draperies, and can do four different kinds of resist dying. And with each one of those things I&#39;ve developed all sorts of odd subsets of skill and knowledge and interest. That&#39;s what following one&#39;s passions does - it&#39;s not necessarily a &quot;balanced&quot; process. In fact, when my life looks more &quot;balanced&quot; with regard to fiber arts, I feel like I&#39;m in some kind of slump! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216588677,"authorName":"fiesta110","from":"&quot;fiesta110&quot; &lt;thoscor@...&gt;","profile":"fiesta110","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Computer overload for my son!

Prior to last September, both my sons were frustrated when the<br/>\nneighborhood school kids chose to play computer games instead of playing<br/>\nother games with them. They were shocked at how much time kids spent on<br/>\nthe computer.  Of course, keeping time etc. was not fun and I started<br/>\nreading and learning more and more about unschooling so I was trying to<br/>\nlet go and see if he would find the balance.   My husband was not quite<br/>\non board with watching and seeing.   The xbox, (that we were so worried<br/>\nabout!) is lying quiet a lot of the time and the computer has become the<br/>\nfavorite place.  It&#39;s been an extremely stressful time as we&#39;ve watched<br/>\nour son who used to be the active, creative, energetic, joyful kid<br/>\nbecome sullen, sedentary, angry.  He is just about refusing to do<br/>\nanything we suggest like go to the pool, go on a float trip, play<br/>\noutside, go on bike rides etc... He has always loved games and for years<br/>\nhe was making his own board games which were getting a little more<br/>\ncomplex over time.  Then he started playing computer games and the<br/>\nthought of trying to create one of those seems monumental to him and now<br/>\nthe games creation has come to a halt.  He has looked on line and played<br/>\naround with come sites but that is too complex so it&#39;s easier to just<br/>\nplay the game.  Now, there is nothing wrong with playing a computer game<br/>\nbut when it starts to take over and affect the whole family it&#39;s hard to<br/>\njust watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few other pieces to the puzzle.  My son has diabetes and now<br/>\nhe&#39;s entering teen years.  So, how much of his moods are because of<br/>\nthese factors and not because of the games is difficult to distinguish. <br/>\nWe just feel like he has a glazed look when he gets off the computer and<br/>\nas he is choosing to stay in the house even if he isn&#39;t on the computer.<br/>\nIt&#39;s affecting our family life.  We used to go out a lot and over this<br/>\nyear we have become almost home bound.  It&#39;s hard not to think that it&#39;s<br/>\nthe games that have caused this change in him.  I know that changes<br/>\nhappen and you can&#39;t keep comparing to what used to be.  We are trying<br/>\nto give him the freedom to make these choices but I know it&#39;s been<br/>\nthrough gritted teeth because of the seemingly overnight transformation<br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen in him.  We have started to leave him for short periods of<br/>\ntime so that our younger son can do some of the things he wants to do. <br/>\nDue to the diabetes, and because we are letting him decide when he is<br/>\nready to start giving himself medecine, he can&#39;t be left for too long. <br/>\nThe lack of activity is also extremely bad for him because of the<br/>\ndiabetes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been the  major obstacle in our family.  There have been more<br/>\nfights this year than I care to think about and I want our joyful family<br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight!<br/>\n<br/>\nCordelia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67749,"nextTopicId":67767}}
