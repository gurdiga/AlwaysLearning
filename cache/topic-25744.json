I tend <br/>\nto escape in reading, I am working on this.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll confess to this, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about mindfulness this week, since I&#39;ve tended to <br/>\nskip on it, and I think I&#39;m starting to see the light.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mind jumps around, and I&#39;m often thinking about what I still need to <br/>\ndo and which thing I&#39;m going to do next, instead of thinking about what <br/>\nI&#39;m currently doing.  (Hey, even as I&#39;m typing this, my eye is falling <br/>\non the To Do list next to my computer.  Distracting.  I should really <br/>\nhave started the baked beans already.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of this is when I&#39;m reading to my kid.  If I&#39;m not totally <br/>\nengrossed by the book, which is rare, then I sometimes count the pages <br/>\nremaining in the chapter, surreptiously, while I&#39;m reading (and mentally <br/>\nreviewing the other things I want or need to do.)  Reminds me of all the <br/>\ntime I spent in school looking at the clock.  (When I&#39;m really bored in <br/>\na lecture situation even as an adult, I&#39;ll actually calculate the <br/>\nremaining minutes as a percentage of the total class time, over and <br/>\nover.  Or I&#39;ll daydream.  But I find it difficult to attend to something <br/>\nthat is tiresome or confusing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m fairly terrible at the mindfulness thing, uh, so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile reading aloud to my son (and thinking), it finally struck me how <br/>\nmuch my son loves the books we are reading and loves being read to.  <br/>\n(Duh!)  And I realized that I could be putting my love into my narration <br/>\nand really feeling it.  Beaming at him in my heart while reading.  Being <br/>\nin tune with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a little odd making the switch from thinking of love as a <br/>\nspontaneous feeling that pops up sometimes, over to thinking of it as a <br/>\ncontinuous presence that just needs to be acknowledged.  (And I wish I <br/>\ncould say that better.)  I just felt I could be thinking &quot;Here&#39;s some <br/>\nlove&quot; with every word I was saying.  (And I thought feeling the love was <br/>\na great alternative to feeling antsy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it was a half-step towards mindfulness for me to think &quot;Here I <br/>\nam, doing something that he loves, with the son that I love.  This is <br/>\nlove.&quot;  (I&#39;m not sure I was truly *mindfully present*  since apparently <br/>\nI was being so darned analytical, but it was a &quot;click&quot; of mindshifting <br/>\nfor me.  And some of the analysis came afterwards.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose of you who have been in a loving good mood all along, or at least <br/>\nwhenever you remembered to try to be, can take a minute and go &quot;Wow, <br/>\nshe&#39;s slow&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to notice that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to ever feel an <br/>\noverflowing love for my To Do list &lt;g&gt;, so I guess I&#39;ll try to give it a <br/>\nsmaller share of my attention!  (Oh, and my point is that I think I can <br/>\n&quot;tune into&quot; the love, on purpose, even when it&#39;s not the loudest voice <br/>\nin my head.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25742,"nextTopicId":25735}}
