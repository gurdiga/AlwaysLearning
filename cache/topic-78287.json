Some of my webpages are not working as well as they did.  When I find little problems I fix them, but someday if I’m not around or able to fix them, they will gradually go to ruin.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting November 2, sayeth Google, my custom web search might not work anymore. I’ve paid $100 a year for the search box at the top here, so use it lots for the next couple of weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/search\">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRight now (until November 2, 2017 or later) it should be working without advertisements. But that option is not going to be continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe box at the bottom of that page covers more sites, but has advertisements.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another thing about the webpage.  I got this message:<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle systems have tested 860 pages from your site and found that 99% of them have critical mobile usability errors. The errors on these 851 pages severely affect how mobile users are able to experience your website. These pages will not be seen as mobile-friendly by GoogleSearch, and will therefore be displayed and ranked appropriately for smartphone users.<br/>\n<br/>\nHERE IS WHAT THAT MEANS:<br/>\n<br/>\nUse a computer. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at those pages with a computer and not a phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were trying to sell you shoes, it would be important (I suppose) for you to buy shoes from your phone, but I’m not selling you shoes. I’m giving you access to some priceless information, and I’m really can’t make those pages friendly to phones.  There’s TOO MUCH on there—lots of reading that can’t possibly be comfortable from a phone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem is Just Add Light and Stir which isn’t technically on my webpage, but the photos mostly live at Photobucket, which is going up to $400 next year.  I pay $60 now, so I have a year to switch over.   Yeah, it some sort of crazy extortion.  I have two photobucket accounts (long story), and the larger older one, I’ll pay for, at least for a while.  LOTS of things on the website live there.  But the smaller, second account, is only for Just Add Light, so those I will gradually (I hope) upload in another way so Google (owner of blogspot) is keeping them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOlder websites will turn to ghost towns eventually, and I’m sorry about that, but time marches on and all. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if you find a link or photo that isn’t working, I’d appreciate a note.  Some of my links to Joyce’s older site don’t work, and I can repair them if I know where they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an e-mail telling how to migrate the site search to their newer non-paid version, but I want to wait until mine really starts working.  It’s likely they won’t undo it all of a sudden, but it will take a while. :-)  Let me know if you go there and get an error message from Google search. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved user groups, and Prodigy mail, and AOL forums, and other forums that have come and been lively and are gone.  This group will someday be a memory.  My website will get ratty.  But right now, this week, it’s pretty great. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don’t know what page you might want to look at, here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nThat star in the upper left is a randomizer.
