It&#39;s a fad, and one of several that have come along since I&#39;ve been helping unschoolers.  People can be mad at me about saying so if they want to, but it might be worth reading these articles and following some of the trails he points to.

Now if you feel better on an elimination diet, no matter whether it&#39;s a physiological or a placebo effect at work, then why not go for it? And it certainly can&#39;t hurt to stop eating refined wheat flour and some of the nutritionally empty ingredients with which it is often combined. But the gap created by wheat-elimination diets is being plugged in large part with those highly processed, often sugar- and fat-heavy foods being churned out by the $4 billion “gluten-free” industry(Meanwhile, an artisan baker I know says some customers are now refusing his whole-grain loaves on the grounds of gluten intolerance, even as they continue to buy croissants and danish—which he&#39;s more than happy to supply.) Alternatively, going all-in on a low-carb diet (as recommended by many, including Davis) has an insupportable ecological impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, simply switching to whole-grain foods as a replacement for empty-calorie, low-fiber products made from refined flours, sugars, etc. can pay big dividends for most of us. But unfortunately, any such healthful trend will remain stalled until the gluten-free fad has faded away, as fads always do.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the whole article (it&#39;s not very long) if this has been an issue in or around your family.
