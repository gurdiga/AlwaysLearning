And I mean country! Our little community doesn&#39;t make most maps and<br/>\nhas only fruit stands, orchards, and a little Baptist Church.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was typing away online last week, and the kids came running in<br/>\nsaying there was a wagon train out front. Sure enough, coming up the highway<br/>\nwere 5 covered wagons and about 15 people on horseback. So, my kids, not<br/>\nhaving an inhibited bone in their body, ran to the property line. The wagon<br/>\ntrain pulled over in the grove of trees just on the other side of the fence.<br/>\nWell, with my kids down there meeting strangers (city tendencies kicking in<br/>\nfor me), I decided, &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll get dressed and see what&#39;s going on.&quot; Sad but<br/>\ntrue, it was nearly noon. &lt;gg&gt; Now, I have not mastered the ability to<br/>\neasily climb a barbed wire fence, so I hopped in the van and drove around to<br/>\nwhere they all were. It was the annual 5 day trail ride that preceded the<br/>\nRed River Rodeo. OF COURSE! We were clueless, asking a million questions.<br/>\nThey were very nice. Invited the kids to sign up to do it with them next<br/>\nyear. Told us all about the parade the next day and who to watch for in the<br/>\nrodeo.  The Trail Boss was a younger woman who admitted that she didn&#39;t<br/>\nsleep on the trail but went home to see that her daughter got to Summer<br/>\nSchool. Ugh. Anyway, I smiled politely so as not to anger the locals. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, it was a very cool thing to see. And, yes, I think Ron, Alyssa<br/>\nand Michael may join them next year. Katie and I will wave to them from the<br/>\nporch, sipping our coffee and mochas!<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\nSue Patterson<br/>\nThornberry, TX<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\n_______________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Question, and being an antique","postDate":"1024147704","msgId":7687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNjE1MTMyNjA1LlVKS1MxNjU0OC5vdXQwMDgudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAbWFya3Njb21wdXRlcj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMy4xNmNhZWYzNy4yYTNiN2E5NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7676,"nextInTopic":7688,"prevInTime":7686,"nextInTime":7688,"topicId":7657,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
