The dishes hadn¹t been touched, the<br/>\nanimals hadn¹t been fed and my youngest daughter was waiting by the door for<br/>\nthe car so she could go out with her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter began the process (several days ago) of unpacking her<br/>\ntravel backpack and sorting through old bags of her stuff and there are<br/>\nshirts and pants and books and papers all over the floor in our music room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband finally purchased our first snow blower and just discovered it¹s<br/>\nmissing an important part, but can¹t find the receipt to prove he even<br/>\nbought it in the first place. (Admittedly not like him.) We¹ve expecting<br/>\nmore than six inches of snow this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI¹m writing the script for our theater group¹s next performance and the<br/>\nauditions are in two days. I¹m only through the first act and still don¹t<br/>\nknow if I¹m even going to include two or three characters or how I¹m going<br/>\nto end it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sheets need to be changed, the dog needs a bath, the cats¹ nails need to<br/>\nbe cut, I have a stack of papers I¹m afraid to look in because I might<br/>\ndiscover something I should have taken care of long ago...and my right<br/>\nnostril is dripping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ate a baker¹s dozen chocolate chip cookies at 11 o¹clock last night and<br/>\nwent into the freezer to get the rest to have for breakfast this morning<br/>\n(they were gone).<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan, not feeling very cool (but thanks anyway, Sandra)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4519,"nextTopicId":4431}}
