Both my kids, when they were little, objected to <br/>\noccasional nail polish.  Now, Emma wears it herself.  I think it was about <br/>\nsecurity, for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy S.O. has a mustache and chin beard (it&#39;s not really a goatee since it&#39;s <br/>\nrounded and covers about a third of his jawline either way - what do you call <br/>\nthat?) which doesn&#39;t quite reach the mustache.  I&#39;ve seen his pictures <br/>\nwithout either -- I wouldn&#39;t want him to go there again.  He&#39;s handsome <br/>\neither way, yes, but this way he looks medieval.

At least beards are fairly soft.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong ago before kids, Keith was living in Salt Lake City, working in a <br/>\ngeology lab, and part of his job was to drive to well-drilling sites and pick <br/>\nup core samples.  Not only did the drillers want some news about where they <br/>\nwere underground, but there&#39;s a map building of all the underground, and the <br/>\nanalysis of those cores helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew he would have to carry a gas mask in case of on-site emergencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne morning at 6:00 a.m. or so, the doorbell rang.  I was disoriented and <br/>\nvery sleep, and stumbled to the door wearing nothing but a t-shirt and <br/>\npanties.   I was much littler then... (note for those who know me now)... BUT <br/>\nanyway there is a REALLY scary guy, just looking at me.  I squinted.  He <br/>\nlooked at me.  I looked at his dog.  Keith&#39;s dog.  I looked at his truck.  <br/>\nKeith&#39;s truck.  I looked at him again.  REALLY SCARY GUY.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these gas masks don&#39;t work unless you&#39;re clean-shaven.   <br/>\nAnd he had driven 15 miles to surprise me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he owned the house and all, so I let him in.  But I could hardly look at <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least he still had nearly waist-length hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo years passed.  I was pregnant with Kirby, and Keith had finished an <br/>\nengineering degree, and he didn&#39;t have a job.  He really needed a job, but <br/>\none interview at Honeywell didn&#39;t go perfectly well.  So our gay hairdresser <br/>\nfriend said &quot;Come over,&quot; and when we left Keith had his hair cut so that I <br/>\ncould see the Glen Cambell in him.  I had gotten mine cut too, so it was even <br/>\nshorter, just for support and so his was longer.  I looked (just for that <br/>\nevening) like something out of a soap opera--poofed and moussed on top, and <br/>\nshaved behind.  We went to several friends&#39; houses, rang the doorbells and <br/>\nsaid &quot;BOO!!&quot;and they were as scared as when I met Keith on the porch that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of nights later, I turned over in the bed, rearranging myself in my <br/>\nsleep, and accidently touched that really short hair on the back of Keith&#39;s <br/>\nhead.   I woke up and jumped back and vocalized (didn&#39;t yell, but made some <br/>\ngrunt) and it woke him up.  I thought there was a stranger in the bed with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have a lot of experience with &quot;IT&quot; whatever it is, Dan, though I&#39;m still <br/>\nnot sure how to describe &quot;it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Keith were a bearded actor he could play all kinds of interesting people, <br/>\nbut if he were a clean-faced actor he would have to play mean guys who slam <br/>\npeople up against walls in alleys and then hurl them into dumpsters.  That&#39;s <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched Black Adder&#39;s Christmas last night because I&#39;d read that Robbie <br/>\nColtrane played the ghost.  I&#39;d watched it many times before, but I watched <br/>\nthe ghost scene twice.  Just like he did as Hagrid, he knocked the door right <br/>\ndown flat.  Just as he did as Hagrid, he come in all scary, but then sat down <br/>\nand talked about family history and honor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if the Harry-Potter-author lady had seen that, and pre-cast Hagrid <br/>\nwhile writing, and THAT&#39;s why that scene went just so?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Husbands looking like people","postDate":"1010220135","msgId":2143,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4LjE0YTNiN2Y4LjI5NjgxNjY3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2141,"nextInTopic":2146,"prevInTime":2142,"nextInTime":2144,"topicId":2105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Peggy wrote: Does he dress up in a kilt? ;) My husband and both my boys do!
