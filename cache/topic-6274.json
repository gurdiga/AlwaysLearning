What worked for me was to put it on him. He could do school with <br/>\nthem if he wanted too. You can cram a whole week into Saturday and Sunday <br/>\nmornings. We do beleive we learn anywhere we find an interest. Maybe your <br/>\nhubby needs to set a learning goal for himself and babystep it until he <br/>\nreachs his goal. I also agree being around other confident unschoolers helps <br/>\nsell the idea that yes our kids are always learning.
