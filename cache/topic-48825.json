Attendees who reserve a condo soon","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-474853255\">Six weeks from now there will be something in Santa Fe that&#39;s never  <br/>\nhappened before--a symposium on longterm unschooling.   Attendees who  <br/>\nreserve a condo soon will have a one bedroom with a fireplace for $79  <br/>\na night (plus tax), or a two bedroom for $99, or a three bedroom  <br/>\n(there&#39;s only one left) for $149 per night.  Each condo has a dining  <br/>\nroom and living room, a couch someone could sleep on, many of them  <br/>\nnice fold-outs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re furnishing firewood and kindling.  I was out cutting mint stalks  <br/>\nthis morning to tie into little bundles for kindling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there are condos left and the time for the discount to expire  <br/>\nis fast approaching (end of November), if anyone wants to speculate on  <br/>\na room now is the time.  It&#39;s possible that a reserved room at  <br/>\ndiscount rate could be transferred to someone who hasn&#39;t yet decided,  <br/>\nor who gets a trip for Christmas or something. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA cancellation might cost one night&#39;s rent, but that would be a  <br/>\ndonation to the conference, in a way, if anyone wants to take such a  <br/>\nrisk that they won&#39;t end up going and no one will pick up the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to reserve a condo for relatives or friends to come and  <br/>\nhang out with you, that&#39;s fine now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really excited about the fact that all of Joyce&#39;s family will be  <br/>\nthere, and all of Pam&#39;s and all of mine.  I don&#39;t figure that will  <br/>\nhappen again, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo reserve condos:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/suss/reservationinformation\">http://sandradodd.com/suss/reservationinformation</a><br/>\nor if you reserve directly with Fort Marcy and they give you the  <br/>\nconference rate, let me know if you&#39;re wanting to transfer that to  <br/>\nsomeone else later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe schedule is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/2009/10/schedule.html\">http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/2009/10/schedule.html</a><br/>\n(Pam, do you have a name for your session yet?)<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry about what exactly Pam or Joyce will say.  It will be  <br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m speaking first about what we&#39;ve learned in the past many years  <br/>\nabout unschooling, and at the end will talk about what we&#39;ve learned  <br/>\nin those past three days.   There will be a session of the teens and  <br/>\nyoung adults, and there will be a dads only session.   Six sessions,  <br/>\nthree evening gatherings, lots of visiting time, and fireplaces.   <br/>\nPeace and big ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/suss\">http://sandradodd.com/suss</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48791,"nextTopicId":48804}}
