At first the whole ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1965528204\">Hi! I mostly lurk here (and love it) but I have to jump in about<br/>\nsharing tv. My boys<br/>\nare 6 and 3 and we just got a game cube 2 weeks ago. At first the whole<br/>\nsharing thing<br/>\nwas driving me batty. But I decided that it was a sharing issue, not a<br/>\ngame cube issue<br/>\n(like you). So I went back and re-read Siblings without Rivalry (great<br/>\nbook!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey suggested taking yourself out of the argument by letting the kids<br/>\ndecide between<br/>\nthem. Since my kids are only 6 and 3, I have found that it helps if I<br/>\nstay there<br/>\nto help them walk through the discussion, BUT I do NOT make the decision<br/>\nfor them.<br/>\nWhat I have been doing is stating what I see (I see 2 boys who both want<br/>\nto play the<br/>\ngame cube) and asking them how they want to work it out. Sometimes they<br/>\nsay they<br/>\ndon&#39;t know, so I will help them out by saying, well, Jason is worried<br/>\nthat he will<br/>\nnever get a turn if Kyle starts playing...Kyle when will you let Jason<br/>\nhave a turn?<br/>\nAnd go from there until they come up with something that works.<br/>\nBut the ultimate deal making is left to themselves. I also explain that<br/>\nI am not<br/>\ngoing to decide who gets to go, because I can&#39;t choose between them...if<br/>\nI do then<br/>\none will be happy and one will be unhappy. But if they decide between<br/>\nthemselves<br/>\nthen they both will be happy (or it is not a good solution and they need<br/>\nto keep<br/>\ntrying!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been absolutely AMAZED at how well this has worked! I never<br/>\nthought I would<br/>\nsee Jason (my 6 yo) *let* Kyle go first, but that is often how they work<br/>\nit out. <br/>\nIt has helped in that Jason has learned that Kyle often wants to play<br/>\nfor a couple<br/>\nof minutes and then will ask Jason to help. Also, since Jason has been<br/>\ngetting better<br/>\nat letting Kyle play some, Kyle is not as possessive about his time on<br/>\nthe game cube<br/>\nand is more likely to give the controller to Jason! And I have started<br/>\nhearing them<br/>\nwork their problems out more rather then just grabbing the controller.<br/>\nNot perfect<br/>\nbut a heck of a lot better then before!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really like about it is that I no longer have to figure out what<br/>\nis &quot;fair&quot;.<br/>\nBecause really, there is no &quot;fair&quot; in this situation...they both have an<br/>\nequally fair<br/>\nneed to play their games as long as they want. By removing myself from<br/>\nthe decision<br/>\nmaking process, I get to be more of a facilitator. I stay there to make<br/>\nsure that<br/>\neach boy gets heard (and help each of them put their feelings and<br/>\narguments into words).<br/>\nI have used this approach with other things as well (including<br/>\ndisagreements with what<br/>\nI want them to do) and it is amazing to watch it work. When I was<br/>\nreading it, I <br/>\nwas a bit skeptical that it would work with my boys, but it has!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I would also get another tv LOL! We have 2 big tvs...one in<br/>\nthe family<br/>\nroom, one in the living room, both with tivo/direct tv. And we have 2<br/>\nsmaller ones<br/>\nin my craft room and dh&#39;s office without direct tv. Makes tv life much<br/>\neasier!<br/>\nNot only with making sharing easier, but it has taken away the urgency<br/>\nto want to<br/>\nwatch because either boy can watch whatever they want whenever they<br/>\nwant. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just read your second message...we do have the two tvs and believe it<br/>\nor not, they<br/>\nusually watch it together. We also have TIVO (digital recorder) and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say<br/>\nenough for it because it allows you to totally get away from the tv&#39;s<br/>\nschedule! Basically<br/>\nyou can set it up to record all the shows you want and they are always<br/>\navailable. My<br/>\nboys don&#39;t even know what times the shows are on...they just go into the<br/>\nNow Showing<br/>\nlist and pick. They are also very selective about what shows they tape<br/>\nwhich is cool<br/>\nto see. I had many the same fears as you about running our life around<br/>\ntv, but since<br/>\nletting go of them, the tv has taken a less and less central role in our<br/>\nlife. It<br/>\nis still there and on quite often, but we are doing lots of other things<br/>\nas well.<br/>\nDo you watch and enjoy shows with them? I have found if I am feeling<br/>\ndisconnected<br/>\nfrom them, if I plop down on the couch with them we have some great<br/>\nconversations<br/>\nand we start getting into other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note...since getting the game cube my dh has been spending a<br/>\nlot more time <br/>\nplaying with the boys. At first it bummed me out that it was &quot;only&quot;<br/>\nplaying computer<br/>\ngames with them (he doesn&#39;t like reading to them and tends to be too<br/>\ncompetitive to<br/>\nplay board games and have fun with them). But they are working on this<br/>\none game<br/>\n(Starfox Adventures) together and it is so neat to watch. Planning<br/>\nstrategies, looking<br/>\nup cheats together...and then the other night while they were playing it<br/>\nturned out<br/>\ninto an all out wrestle match (a fun one) in our living room...so by<br/>\nspending time<br/>\nplaying computer games, my dh&#39;s relationship with the boys in improving!<br/>\nThey have<br/>\nbeen more willing to ask him to help them with things (that they used to<br/>\nonly come to<br/>\nme for). Not to mention that I get an hour after dinner to do my yoga.<br/>\nSo you might<br/>\nreally be surprised what will happen when you start enjoying what they<br/>\nenjoy. I<br/>\nmay not personally think that the games they play or all the shows they<br/>\nwatch are fun<br/>\n(although many of them are!) but watching them enjoy themselves helps me<br/>\nenjoy it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that this helps! Sorry that this got so long...<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17228,"nextTopicId":17271}}
