That&#39;s when I<br/>\nrealized the meaning behind those smiles and vague comments from moms with<br/>\nyounger kids going past us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn also gave us the space to be together, telling us to enjoy our videos.<br/>\nIf your spouse competes with the kids for your attention or with you for<br/>\ntheir attention--unschooling and family relationships in general won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn got nostalgic for when Rowan was three or so, and he actually drew the<br/>\nparallel about how our relationship with our son started with all the<br/>\npower/responsibility on the adult side and all the love, respect, and<br/>\npatience flowing to our son.  Now, he is seeing flow both ways, and with our<br/>\ntwo younger kids at a sleepover, John was able to celebrate the journey.  I<br/>\nwas too busy hanging out with Rowan in the moment to see any of it on<br/>\nSaturday night:) He reflected on what an amazing kid Rowan is and what an<br/>\namazing patient open-minded man he is growing up to become.  The next<br/>\nmorning he was talking to me about how wonderful it was to hear Rowan and I<br/>\nchatting and laughing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up watching Abbot and Costello shorts on youtube and some cartoons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized how quickly time flies and just how happy I am I didn&#39;t listen to<br/>\nnaysayers, but instead listened to my son and my instinct.  The thing about<br/>\nbeing an unschooling family is none of it was &quot;strange&quot; to me, and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil later on that I realized why it might seem so odd to others.  It seems<br/>\nso sad that a mom and her teenager eating, laughing and watching a movie<br/>\nshould be so unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Good Parenting (in the context of Unschooling)","postDate":"1268072403","msgId":51791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwMzA4MTAyMGwzMmE0NWI4MXljNWU1ZjIzNGJkMjBhMzY4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5QzUwQzI5LUU2MkItNEJFMy05QzIxLTE2RkZFNzk2ODJDMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM5QzUwQzI5LUU2MkItNEJFMy05QzIxLTE2RkZFNzk2ODJDMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51769,"nextInTopic":51813,"prevInTime":51790,"nextInTime":51792,"topicId":51769,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s going on my refrigerator.
