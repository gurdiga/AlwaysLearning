What we want to create is a community of people of all ages working/playing/learning together, with roles changing depending on the situation, and we believe it would be difficult to do this if the organization was run by the &#39;adults.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been very conscious about my role as the oldest member, by a long shot, of the core group - I am 50, plus there are two teens (homeschoolers who are unschooling wannabes) and two 21-year-olds - that is making consensus decisions about how things are run, including how we become financially sustainable. I might have a little more clarity about the vision, I have a lot of business and organizational experience so I share that, and I make myself available to help make things easier for whoever might need/ask for it, but mostly I pursue my own interests and passions, and try to be an example of what we hope everyone does. I&#39;d get bored just sitting around waiting for someone to need my help...Steve Cooperman<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.comFrom\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>: Wed, 20 Feb 2008 14:47:36 -0700Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;...
