Some parents get stuck seeing their kids as helpless so  <br/>\ndo everything for them. Some parents are impatient for their kids to  <br/>\nbe less needy so are anxious for them to be self sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They are<br/>\n&gt; still, in some ways, incompetent.

So  <br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing wrong with the denotation of incompetent, but the  <br/>\nconnotation has lots wrong with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mother resents doing for her child, thinking of her child as  <br/>\nincompetent I don&#39;t believe will help her do more with less resentment.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I don&#39;t want a parent to be<br/>\n&gt; refusing to do something for their child because they happen to feel a<br/>\n&gt; little resentment that day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit I wanted him to say &quot;But if you consciously shift your  <br/>\nperspective&quot; -- which he did! -- but I didn&#39;t take in the rest. So,  <br/>\nyes, shift your perspective, but not necessarily one direction. Shift  <br/>\nit in the direction that your child needs you to! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some parents it will help them to see their child as competent  <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re too used to seeing their children&#39;s weaknesses. For  <br/>\nsome parents it will help them to see their child as still needing  <br/>\nhelp because maybe their parents withdrew their help too young and  <br/>\nthey resent having to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s also pressure some parents feel to not just help their  <br/>\nkids but to help them do something the &quot;right way&quot; -- like help them  <br/>\neat only 3 cookies -- rather than helping the child meet their needs.  <br/>\nBut sometimes there is a right! Punching someone in the face to get a  <br/>\ntoy back isn&#39;t right. Which is why philosophy needs examples to  <br/>\nexplain it ;-) (I often resort to the long &quot;help a child get what the  <br/>\nwant in ways that are safe and respectful&quot;.) Ultimately in some cases  <br/>\nlike this, the wording that will help one person move the right  <br/>\ndirection will move another person in the wrong direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest is to see the whole child as being a mixture of capable and  <br/>\nneeding help. Being supportive is a good phrase but is too often  <br/>\nequated with helping --which sometimes means doing for them. So the  <br/>\nbest route to a middle ground from the two extremes is to listen to  <br/>\nyour child. Take your cues from them. Get to know them and their  <br/>\nneeds. Not all children are so straightforward that they&#39;ll say  <br/>\nexactly what they need.

I saw a mom <br/>\nbrush off her 9 year old who was saying she was hungry. That mom is a <br/>\nbig follower of this kind of thinking and I think she only does things <br/>\nfor her kids when she feels &quot;inspired.&quot; I  &quot;Only do things if and when <br/>\nyou really feel like it.&quot; Just doesn&#39;t seem sensible advice for parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Food and Teen Issues and everything else","postDate":"1251477384","msgId":47012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Q0NEMUExLTUzRjktNEQ3OC05NjRGLUVDNjFCNUQxNzU5NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47017,"prevInTime":47011,"nextInTime":47013,"topicId":47012,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes I think Scott Noelle listens in since his daily emails sometimes touch on what gets discussed on the lists ;-) Anyway here s something about helping","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-755709962\">Sometimes I think Scott Noelle listens in since his daily emails  <br/>\nsometimes touch on what gets discussed on the lists ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway here&#39;s something about helping them versus fixing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; :: Helping vs. Co-creation ::<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Q: How do you know when it&#39;s appropriate<br/>\n&gt;        to offer your child help/assistance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    A: When the offer feels *inspired* rather<br/>\n&gt;        than fear-based.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re coming from a perspective that your child is<br/>\n&gt; helpless, damaged, weak, incompetent, lost, wrong,<br/>\n&gt; etc., then your &quot;help&quot; will only give power to that<br/>\n&gt; belief. It won&#39;t feel inspired to you, and it won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; inspire your child to connect with his or her Power.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But if you consciously shift your perspective to one<br/>\n&gt; in which you see your child as capable of finding his<br/>\n&gt; or her way, you won&#39;t feel like you &quot;should&quot; help, and<br/>\n&gt; you probably won&#39;t offer to help unless asked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, you might be *inspired* to get involved in a<br/>\n&gt; way that doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re a &quot;have&quot; helping a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;have-not&quot; -- it&#39;ll feel more like two souls playing<br/>\n&gt; together, co-creating purely for the joy of it!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailygroove.net/helping\">http://dailygroove.net/helping</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to forward this message to your friends!<br/>\n&gt; (Please include this paragraph and everything above.)<br/>\n&gt; Copyright (c) 2009 by Scott Noelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47037,"nextTopicId":47127}}
