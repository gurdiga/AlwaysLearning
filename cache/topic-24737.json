I should be able<br/>\nto put my needs on the shelf until he&#39;s older. I<br/>\nshould be able to make this work financially. I should<br/>\nbe able to handle these sacrifices. I denied myself<br/>\nuntil I developed severe panic attacks. it turns out,<br/>\nI have to go back to work, for financial reasons<br/>\n(egads) but even more so to meet my own needs so that<br/>\nI can bring my best self to my mothering. this may<br/>\nresult in my son having to attend a preschool or<br/>\ndaycare for a while. I thought I would never do that<br/>\nbut my son needs me at my best, and if that&#39;s what it<br/>\ntakes then I have to be flexible, and realistic about<br/>\nmy own limits. he was getting too much of me at my<br/>\nworst before I admitted this. we&#39;re all human; as moms<br/>\nit is easy to insist we are not! we want perfection<br/>\nfor our children, and we get ideas about what that<br/>\nmeans, then we make ourselves sick trying to do the<br/>\nimpossible. be gentle with yourself, get support,<br/>\nfigure out what you can do differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nvery best wishes for positive change,<br/>\nJulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24696,"nextTopicId":24738}}
