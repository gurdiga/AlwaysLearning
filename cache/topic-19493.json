Can&#39;t hurt!<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found your site while checking the traffic to my site (Math Cats -<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.mathcats.com); I noticed that a visitor this evening had arrived at Math<br/>\n<br/>\nCats through a link from your &quot;Unschooling and Math&quot; page -<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/math.\">http://sandradodd.com/math.</a>  I read the lengthy piece in the right column by<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Wyatt and the descriptions in the left column, though I haven&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\nfollowed the links yet.  I was tickled to see the description of Math Cats:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I found a great math site that seems like it was designed for<br/>\n<br/>\nunschoolers.... www.mathcats.com  You can mess aroung with polygons and<br/>\n<br/>\ntessalations, explore what you like with no determined path or<br/>\n<br/>\ndrills...great stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I&#39;ve just read that Linda Wyatt wrote resonates deeply with me,<br/>\n<br/>\neven though I and my three children were all schooled in the conventional<br/>\n<br/>\nway.  But the only time I loved math in school was when we learned how to<br/>\n<br/>\nmake some polyhedra out of triangles.  We actually just cut out templates in<br/>\n<br/>\nschool, but I was so intrigued that I went home and figured out how to draw<br/>\n<br/>\nperfectly even rows of equilateral triangles so that I could make as many<br/>\n<br/>\nicosahedra and other polyhedra as my heart desired.  And I eventually became<br/>\n<br/>\none of those teachers who was rather uncomfortable teaching math; it<br/>\n<br/>\ncertainly wasn&#39;t why I had gone into teaching; I just endured the math<br/>\n<br/>\nlesson each day, until my wise principal once observed one of my math<br/>\n<br/>\nlessons and pointed out that if I put as much creativity and enthusiasm into<br/>\n<br/>\nteaching math as I did into teaching creative writing, my students would<br/>\n<br/>\nlove math as much as they loved writing.  Wow - that was a revelation for<br/>\n<br/>\nme.  From that point on, I did everything I could to make math class fun,<br/>\n<br/>\nhands-on, and meaningfully connected to the real world, and yes, my students<br/>\n<br/>\ndid start loving math.  So now I&#39;m trying to do the same thing in the online<br/>\n<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m frankly amazed when kids sometimes write to tell me that their math<br/>\n<br/>\nskills have improved from visiting Math Cats, because that is certainly not<br/>\n<br/>\nmy priority, though I think it&#39;s pretty cool if it happens along the way.  I<br/>\n<br/>\nmostly want kids to discover the same joy and beauty in math that I<br/>\n<br/>\nexperienced in my youth when I began turning ordinary pieces of paper into<br/>\n<br/>\nbeautiful geometric ornaments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyhow, I just want to say I&#39;m glad to have discovered your page, and I&#39;m<br/>\n<br/>\nlooking forward to reading the other material on your site.  Also, I would<br/>\n<br/>\nbe very happy to correspond with some of the unschoolers who visit your<br/>\n<br/>\nsite.  I&#39;d like to know more about the unschooling approach to learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter visiting your page, I think I&#39;d like to add an &quot;unschooling&quot; idea bank<br/>\n<br/>\nto the grown-up cats&#39; section of Math Cats, and you can be sure I&#39;ll be<br/>\n<br/>\nrecommending your site!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy Petti<br/>\n<br/>\ncreator of Math Cats<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mathcats.com\">http://www.mathcats.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19495,"nextTopicId":19503}}
