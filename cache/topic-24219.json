I&#39;m hoping for it to be simple,  <br/>\nfun and not intimidating for non-musicians, and to connect music to  <br/>\nother things.  I dont want it to try to be everything to anyone,  <br/>\nbecause anyone wanting to search out music resource online can pretty  <br/>\neasily do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/music\">http://sandradodd.com/music</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe accounts of how unschoolers have &quot;done music&quot; or stories of how  <br/>\nmusic has unexpectedly led to other things (or arisen out of other  <br/>\ninterests) would be cool.  And if anyone knows of other religious- <br/>\nMIDI sites, that would be good too.  Not other Christian or Jewish  <br/>\nsites, but music of other religious cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24206,"nextTopicId":24233}}
