She&#39;s always liked to be <br/>\nthe one in charge. It does occur to me as well that it could be an attempt <br/>\nto make it &#39;fun&#39; for us. She wants us to play the way she finds fun.

She will come by and comment on <br/>\nthings (she just said to her dad, who&#39;s playing sims, &quot;I can&#39;t believe your <br/>\ncharacter isn&#39;t dead yet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there something going on in her life that she feels isn&#39;t in her <br/>\n&gt; control?

We&#39;ve had some hard times here lately, that could be affecting <br/>\nher, and she also has a lot of friends who are a couple of years older, and <br/>\nthus more competent than her at some things (and not at others.) She has <br/>\nyounger friends as well, but she tends to only compare herself to those who <br/>\nare better than she is!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If it&#39;s about control, maybe what would help is some matter-of-fact <br/>\n&gt; feedback. Then let it percolate for her so she can grow an understanding <br/>\n&gt; of how<br/>\n&gt; leading and bossing are different. Say, for instance, &quot;That&#39;s not fun for <br/>\n&gt; me.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m <br/>\nsaying it in the wrong way, or just that it&#39;s going to take time? I try not <br/>\nto say too much, since she doesn&#39;t really like lots of talking (especially <br/>\nif she feels that she might be doing something wrong, she&#39;s very sensitive <br/>\nto that), but this topic has come up quite a bit over the last year or two, <br/>\nso maybe she&#39;s heard it too much?

The issue I’m having is that my daughter wants us to play particular \ngames. For example, she really wants her dad to play sims. He’s willing to give \nit a go for her, but as soon as he sits down to play, she wants to set up a huge \nfamily for him, with 3 sims and 4 horses, then when he asks how to do something, \nshe gives him a half answer in an annoyed voice, and says his sims are all going \nto die. Understandably, he finds this very frustrating!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I’m not sure why my daughter wants us all to play specific games in a \nspecific way. It’s not that she wants to watch us, because she usually goes off \nand watches YouTube while we play. I’m at a loss what she is getting out of it, \nand how to make it more enjoyable for all involved. Her dad and I are usually \nwilling to give a game a go, and often really enjoy playing them (her dad is \nactually getting a little into the sims), but it’s very hard to learn a new game \nwhen she basically insists on setting it up to be as difficult as \npossible.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I’d love some suggestions on how to handle this? Her knowledge of these \ngames is way ahead of us in a lot of cases, as she spends a lot of time watching \nYouTube tutorials on them, or experimenting with them. Her dad and I have less \ntime to do this, especially seeing as as soon as we sit down to play, she either \nwants to join in (and then has specific things she does or doesn’t want us to \ndo), or she wants to do something different.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I’d love some new perspectives on this one!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Thanks,</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Tamara</div></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75079,"nextTopicId":75150}}
