They might be going along with what they&#39;ve heard because it  <br/>\nsounds sensible and imposing limits is a lot easier than delving into  <br/>\nresearch they&#39;re not confident they can interpret objectively. (It  <br/>\n*does* sound reasonable that exposure a lot of ads will cause kids to  <br/>\nwant a lot of things, and that candy will make them ignore more  <br/>\nnutritious food (we can even see that happening if controls are  <br/>\nlifted at Halloween and kids pig out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes those reasons are based on fear. Sometimes fear can  <br/>\ncause people to research to support their fear rather than understand  <br/>\nwhat they fear better and see the situation more objectively.  <br/>\nSometimes the information itself is skewed because the only ones  <br/>\nwriting and researching are those who are afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, it&#39;s much easier to find research on the negative  <br/>\neffects of television than on the positive effects. It&#39;s much easier  <br/>\nto find articles on how bad sugar is than to find articles on why you  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t worry. It&#39;s much easier to find the negative effects of  <br/>\nsecularism than the positive effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier and more comforting to build protective walls  <br/>\nagainst what we fear than to face the fears and find out the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when unschoolers start arguing against limiting TV what  <br/>\npeople believe we&#39;re saying is that our opinion is better than yours  <br/>\nand you need to keep your opinion to yourself about TV and sugar and  <br/>\nplastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what we&#39;re doing is reporting what *really* happens when kids are  <br/>\nfree to explore the world in a supportive home, and free to use and  <br/>\nrefine their own internal guides in an environment where parents are  <br/>\nthere to help them make decisions. (Not make the decision we want  <br/>\nthem to, but make their own decisions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we pass on about TV and video games and candy isn&#39;t what we  <br/>\nguess will happen. It&#39;s not what we hope will happen while we look  <br/>\nthrough unschooling rosy glasses. It&#39;s what actually does happen. And  <br/>\nthen also our best guesses at why unschoolers get different results  <br/>\nthan what conventional parents fear will happen (and sometimes see  <br/>\nhappen).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are vegetarian parents who help their kids explore the world of  <br/>\nfood without forcing them or guilting them into becoming vegetarians.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are parents who dislike TV who find a way to see TV through  <br/>\ntheir kids and see the benefits of it. (And their kids don&#39;t end up  <br/>\nwatching porn at 6!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember at least one fundamentalist Christian who said she wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nforcing her beliefs on her kids and was allowing them to make up  <br/>\ntheir own minds about religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear is not a good mix to add to unschooling.

On one b-day, my<br/>\ndaughter received several barbie/bratz type things, and it took me<br/>\nliterally 2 hrs to open them all and seperate the recycling from the<br/>\ngarbage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could make it a big ethical environmental issue.  I could boycott<br/>\nthose products.  I could write the companies that do that.  I could give<br/>\ncharitable donations to companies that work on my behalf to get those<br/>\ncompanies to stop.  I could seek out similar toys with less packaging. <br/>\nI have a TON of choices.  The one I won&#39;t sacrifice is my children&#39;s<br/>\nhappiness in purchasing and enjoying those things.  I&#39;m not even going<br/>\nto put my negative voice into the purchase of those things because I<br/>\ndislike the packaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids KNOW that I feel strongly about environmental issues and ethical<br/>\nconsumerism because I seek out the more ethical choices when I make my<br/>\nown purchases and I recycle and do as much as I can in that end.  We<br/>\ntalk about it.  One day, they may adopt my ideals, and one day they may<br/>\ndecide that I was too extreme about it and relax on it in their own<br/>\nlives.  Either way, they will have each made a knowledgable choice for<br/>\nthemselves, just like I did.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Limits- tv, sugar and other","postDate":"1227712422","msgId":40541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlEQkYwMkI2LTAwNUItNDI3RS1CMkQ0LUY4MjE3NEMwMTcwNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEVCNkJBNjRGLUJBQkUtNENEMS04MzZDLUVDQTNBRjkzQzI2Q0BtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdnaWgzNiszcG1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUI2QkE2NEYtQkFCRS00Q0QxLTgzNkMtRUNBM0FGOTNDMjZDQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40533,"nextInTopic":40562,"prevInTime":40540,"nextInTime":40542,"topicId":40476,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s a famous poster that says Expose Yourself to Art.

I&#39;ve read most of the<br/>\nmajor books, and dabbled in the communities that spring up around most<br/>\nfaiths.

Some of those stories are peachy-keen  <br/>\nBible stories.  The only reason for a Pagan to have a fear or  <br/>\naversion of Bible stories is if they secretly think they&#39;re true, or  <br/>\nsomehow separate from the secular history of the world.  The FACT  <br/>\nthat one explanation for different languages is that it was to keep  <br/>\npeople from working together to reach as high as where God lives is a  <br/>\ngood thing to know.  The fact that there are flood stories in many  <br/>\ncultures is cool to know when geological evidence of a huge flood in  <br/>\nthe Middle East comes along.   Ideas about what happens after death  <br/>\nare common to all people, because people try to make sense of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a twenty-questions-meme-thing going around I filled out on my  <br/>\nblog today, and one question was about &quot;superstition.&quot;  I answered it  <br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n<br/>\n14. Why do people still believe in the supernatural?<br/>\nLightning, thunders, darkness, wind, sun, fear of lack of water, fear  <br/>\nof too much water. Elemental forces and people&#39;s natural urge to find  <br/>\npatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve offered to take my kids to church.  When we go to a wedding or a  <br/>\nfuneral, I coach them on expected behaviors in different kinds of  <br/>\nchurches.  Holly and I have gone just to go.  She&#39;s gone with other  <br/>\nfamilies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect a vegetarian to bring hot dogs home, but I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nsay &quot;good idea!&quot; if a vegetarian told a child &quot;hot dogs will kill you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend in college who was raised by a unitarian mother and an  <br/>\nagnostic-to-atheist physicist father, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in  <br/>\nthe 60&#39;s.

Not good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if any of you have been hiding from the Bible, don&#39;t be that way.   <br/>\nAt least find some story books. If you want to balance out stories of  <br/>\nheaven or hell with stories of Valhalla or the boatman at the River  <br/>\nStyx, or if you want to balance  baby Jesus stories with baby Krishna  <br/>\nor The Great Pumpkin, it&#39;s better than not saying anything at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is happy and painless  <br/>\nand it might be fun for you to look up &quot;the real story&quot; (or what you  <br/>\nmight have in a Bible, Torah or Koran near you).  The coolest  <br/>\ndifference for me is the way Joseph revealed himself to them in the  <br/>\nBible, and how  he knew so much about them while they were relatively  <br/>\nclueless:  They were speaking Hebrew, which he understood.  He only  <br/>\nspoke Egyptian in front of them the whole first visit and sent them  <br/>\nback to Canaan to bring their father.  He kept one brother as a  <br/>\nhostage.  The musical simplifies that into a beautiful short version,  <br/>\nbut the long version is very cool, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an interview with Ted Neely who plays Jesus in Jesus Christ  <br/>\nSuperstar.  A TV interviewer in Florida was asking him about the  <br/>\ndifferences between the musical then (in the 70&#39;s) and now.
