Fortunately, I read <br/>\n_How to talk so kids will listen..._ way early in my parenting time and so I <br/>\nstick with one word reminders.  For my adult kids who still live here (Jon <br/>\nwill be 18 in 5 days; Jake, 20, is off at boot camp), I make simple, specific <br/>\nlists.  They have always liked this method more than verbal reminders, <br/>\nbecause it feels less like nagging to them.  And it helps because I rarely <br/>\nsee them when they are working.  I just tape it to their doors.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years they&#39;ve come to realize that it&#39;s just better to do the list <br/>\nand pick up their shoes then to wait for me to meltdown.  What I hate is that <br/>\nI can never have a break.  It&#39;s like, if I give myself permission to let my <br/>\nlaundry pile up for a few days, it gives *everyone* permission to let their <br/>\nlaundry pile up.  There&#39;s no one to take up the initiative if I don&#39;t keep <br/>\non, although dh does do his share most of the time.  Unless I am clearly not <br/>\ncarrying the load.  Then he has permission to not to do so, either.  Hate <br/>\nthat part.  Can&#39;t quite describe it, either.  Hope someone here understands <br/>\nwhat I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon has a real problem with laundry.  It wasn&#39;t an issue when we had a big <br/>\nhouse and he lived upstairs.  I didn&#39;t go up there much, and when he needed <br/>\nsomething to wear, he washed it first.  Now he lives right next to the other <br/>\ntwo bedrooms and the second bath, and shares it with his little brother.  I <br/>\ncannot stand to walk into that bathroom and see all the washcloths in the <br/>\nbottom of the bathtub, and his pants and undies all over the floor, and then <br/>\nsee it in his bedroom, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I made a (temporary) deal with him.  For my peace of mind, I&#39;ll do his <br/>\nlaundry--but he has to keep all his dirty clothes in a basket at all times.  <br/>\nHe has to empty his pockets, and turn his socks right side out, too.  So far <br/>\nit&#39;s working.  I told him I was training him, and that eventually he would be <br/>\nlearning to do his laundry, too.  (He knows how to do laundry, but he has <br/>\ntrouble with organization.)  Sometimes I feel icky that I&#39;m still doing my 18 <br/>\nyo&#39;s laundry, and I wonder if I&#39;ll still be doing it when he&#39;s 25.  But then <br/>\nI remind myself that 18 is not a magic number and I try to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Just wanted to thank you guys","postDate":"1036171880","msgId":10122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQzJCQTY4LkU0MjFBRjFGQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGE5LjMwNzM4ODg0LjJhZjNmNjlkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10121,"nextInTopic":10123,"prevInTime":10121,"nextInTime":10123,"topicId":10054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** Trust me, they have seen the full extent of my unhappiness.

If so I know *I* would be a lot more upset at the lack of<br/>\ncontribution to housework from an adult partner than I would be a lack<br/>\nof contribution from the kids.  Especially if the adult is also throwing<br/>\nclothes on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are messier than others.  I didn&#39;t clean more than my friends,<br/>\nbut I was blessed with a kid that didn&#39;t throw stuff around at a rapid<br/>\nrate.  (And he was late with scissors so he didn&#39;t make paper &quot;snow&quot; constantly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff that makes less mess than full-tilt art and toy projects: playing<br/>\noutside (w/o mud), playing Nintendo, watching television, and<br/>\n(sometimes) reading and being read to.  Oh, let&#39;s not forget going to<br/>\nother people&#39;s houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also see a lot of variation between kids.  A few kids are naturally<br/>\nneat and always put the video back in the box, put both shoes together,<br/>\netc.  If you have a few that are at the other end of the spectrum then<br/>\nthe amount of chaos must be daunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think any kid can and will spontaneously clean a bedroom or<br/>\nliving room that looks like a bomb went off in it.  I think it takes<br/>\nyears of teaching, modeling, and most importantly cleaning it up with<br/>\nthem before they are able to do much useful cleaning by themselves. <br/>\n(And even then, I can&#39;t promise you that they will want to clean.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWHATEVER YOU DO, don&#39;t use the tactics that your mother-in-law used to<br/>\nteach your husband to do chores.

Ren wrote back about feeling stressed when the<br/>\nhouse was a mess.  I finally figured it out last night.  I had still been<br/>\nhanging on to the notion that the kids &quot;should&quot; help me more around the<br/>\nhouse.  That my priorities &quot;should&quot; be their priorities.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>\nchore charts per se.  We would have a meeting in the morning where we would<br/>\ntalk about what needed to get done that day and take turns picking what we<br/>\nwanted to do.  Less strident than a chore chart but required none-the-less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally gave it up yesterday.  Amid crying on my part, I realized that I<br/>\nwas sending negative energy into our home, aimed at my children, because of<br/>\na silly dirty house.  What a relief to move past that.  I feel liberated!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today, my kids have voluntarily cleaned up the mess from lunch, fixed<br/>\nMichelle&#39;s hair, helped my find stamps, fed their animals and milked the<br/>\ngoats.  I was able to look at my child and see the gift of their time and<br/>\nenergy that they were giving me and feel truly thankful.  Not resentful that<br/>\nthere are STILL toys on the stairs and having that eclipse the good the kids<br/>\nare doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who finds her house just as messy or clean (depending on your<br/>\norientation) today as she did yesterday but finds herself and her children<br/>\nmuch happier</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10497,"nextTopicId":10475}}
