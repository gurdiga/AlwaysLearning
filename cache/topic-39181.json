They have an OLD gymnasium, 80 or 100 years old.  It  <br/>\nwas only half full or so, and I had taken lots of kids and we met up  <br/>\nwith others.  The back row was Kirby and Marty and other friends, so  <br/>\nthey had a good view of the thing that  happened.   A friend named  <br/>\nMegan was young--fiveish--and sitting with me and Holly in the third  <br/>\nor fourth row back, or so.   She didn&#39;t know the story.   When Mr.  <br/>\nMushnik leaned over to give the plant some water, Megan sat up  <br/>\nsharply and said (to the actor, that loudly) &quot;NO!  DON&#39;T!&quot; and it did  <br/>\nadd greatly to the performance.  &quot;Mr. Mushnik&quot; paused, and looked at  <br/>\nMegan thoughtfully and then went back to watering the plant with a  <br/>\nposture that said &quot;Going to do it anyway.&quot;  It was SO COOL that a  <br/>\nteenaged amateur actor in a high school show was able to incorporate  <br/>\nthat unexpected outburst into what he was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] disney princesses","postDate":"1223400146","msgId":39182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExQzU1N0I3LUM5MEEtNDA1OC1BNjM2LTA3QTk0NEQ1NjhDM0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZmZGFlMTY1MDgxMDA3MDkxNG0xMTkxZDU5Y3IzNzFlYjlkNzAwMzFmNTNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDZmZGFlMTY1MDgxMDA3MDkxNG0xMTkxZDU5Y3IzNzFlYjlkNzAwMzFmNTNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39181,"nextInTopic":39188,"prevInTime":39181,"nextInTime":39183,"topicId":39181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
