I<br/>\nhave no doubt that if we hadn&#39;t been back again in a reasonable time,<br/>\nshe would have been out looking for us. Similarly we were allowed to<br/>\nwalk up the road to visit a friend by ourselves, but our Mum and her Mum<br/>\nhad a &quot;dropped-call&quot; code (two rings and put the phone down, back when<br/>\ndaytime phone calls were expensive!) to let the other mother know when<br/>\nwe&#39;d set off and when we arrived. As a young teenager I learnt to ride a<br/>\nbike safely on the road, and then I set off on excursions for the<br/>\nmorning or afternoon. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid isn&#39;t anything like that age yet, but I gather that (from hearing<br/>\nother parents speak) a lot of parents now would consider going up the<br/>\nshops on your own &quot;too dangerous&quot;. But without giving children<br/>\nresponsibility, as they can handle it, what happens when they reach 16<br/>\nor 18 or 21 and suddenly have much more responsibility all at once? The<br/>\nperception of danger (from terrifying news stories) doesn&#39;t match the<br/>\nactuality of it, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling as partnering your child: to be a partner to me suggests<br/>\nsupporting but also stepping back when your partner can and wants to go<br/>\nit alone. Supporting them in learning the skills and world-knowledge<br/>\nthat they need to go up the shops and buy sweeties (that was so exciting<br/>\nwhen I was little!), or take a long bike ride on their own, when/if they<br/>\nwant to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Interesting thing is that when my mom or dad or someone older was with<br/>\n&gt; us  in one of our adventures we had even more fun and I remember<br/>\n&gt; those occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s different though, right?

I&#39;ve just been reading a discussion about free-range parenting, and it was this very point that kept troubling me. All too often, proponents of free-range parenting seem to focus on some idealised notion of &#39;freedom&#39; - to roam about, to undertake adventures, to explore and learn new things. It all sounds wonderful, but their focus is not on their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I love about unschooling is that it helps me to strike the right balance between creating a space in which my children can happily learn and explore, and being mindfully present with them, especially in helping them to resolve conflicts. Even if I simply say,&#39;how do you think we can solve this?&#39;, my presence and input helps them to resolve the issue in a timely way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that those who focus on &#39;freedom&#39; rather than their child also on some level want a bit of freedom from their child. To me it looks disconnected, and sometimes, irresponsible. My kids are 8 and 5, so according to Sandra&#39;s joke graph that&#39;s actually pretty accurate, I should and do put in most of my waking hours playing with, caring for and nurturing my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely\">http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely</a><br/>\n<br/>\nClaire</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136234893,"authorName":"Shauna Reisewitz","from":"Shauna Reisewitz &lt;shaunareisewitz@...&gt;","profile":"shaunareisewitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: a new &#39;democratic&#39; school","postDate":"1362647551","msgId":70820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCNEJCMkY4LTMxNEYtNDczRi04OTQ5LUZBNUE2NDg4ODdFN0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70819,"nextInTopic":70822,"prevInTime":70819,"nextInTime":70821,"topicId":70803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"+++No school can unschool.

It&#39;s not linguistically or logically or socially possible.+++<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a slightly different perspective. Perhaps it&#39;s true that a school itself can&#39;t unschool, but there can be a school that supports unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be the only person that this applies to but my &quot;birth and babyhood&quot; as an unschooler happened while I was a teacher in a public charter school that completely supported unschoolers (for a while). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe encouraged and deeply respected familial relationships, children growing at their own pace. Everything was optional. We did meet with the parents but it wasn&#39;t to discuss standards and requirements, it was to enjoy tea, and get to know the children and see all the cool things they were working on. We encouraged people who came to us from school to spend months or years (if necessary) deschooling.  We encouraged and respected teens&#39; needs to cocoon. We encouraged families with really young children to stay home. One of the central pieces of our program happened in this wonderful house, where all ages of kids would gather and play games, eat lunch, work on their computer games, swing, chat, do art, lay all over each other like piles of puppies, with a grandmother type teacher, and me and a younger teacher interacting and just hanging out observing the children, helping them when they needed help, socially, physically, getting food organized.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe offered swimming classes at the local pool, chess from a local master, improvisational theater, art, organic gardening on a real farm, doll making, quilting, writing, field trips that families would go on together. Parents were welcome everywhere. And again everything was optional. Many lovely unschooling families enjoyed our program..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started working there no one (or only a couple people) chose to test. None of what we offered was compulsory.  we did need to collect work samples and note what people did each month- but we were very loose about what we accepted.  people would just give a xeroxed list over and over.. send a picture of chocolate chip cookies their child made...  It really was idyllic. I&#39;d bring my babies and nurse as I talked to kids and parents, or taught a science class. Things changed though, and it is no longer what it used to be. Testing is required, and now parents and teachers do have to go over the standards, and I was no longer able to bring my children, so I quit. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it WAS a school that supported unschooling families.  It&#39;s possible, and  it was cutting edge education wise- It allowed people of all socioeconomic levels (and we had some very poor people) to unschool and have access to classes and activities and field trips that would otherwise be cost prohibitive for them.   It also provided a wonderful multi aged  community. We saw different combinations of people from this community everyday.. It was really rich. Some people we saw very infrequently, or not at all, others we saw nearly daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this list isn&#39;t the place to do it, but I think it&#39;s important to keep that vision of a school as a possibility for public education. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that some of these stepping stone programs like democratic schools or the one that i am setting up, are good and useful to give families options to allow their kids more freedom, and joy. Unschooling can be really daunting for &quot;regular people&quot; And at least these types of programs give a community and some mentorship where people can get closer to living lives of freedom and joy and rich learning with their children in a place where they feel supported, and  more comfortable than they would be going at it alone.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: a new &#39;democratic&#39; school","postDate":"1362629707","msgId":70818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtoOTQ4Yit0b3U1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTmYyTl9QUzJuRDllRktzZmt6QVd4aWN2Q0M0cE5EcGVPUzdPMHJfNDVEaUFzUE9HZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70817,"nextInTopic":70819,"prevInTime":70817,"nextInTime":70819,"topicId":70803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Nevermind that some children have a low<br/>\nfrustration tolerance and benefit from a parent&#39;s assistance.  It is a<br/>\nmatter of most parents become &#39;expert&#39; at what works with their own<br/>\nchildren.  My son never wanted help, my daughter would ask for advice on<br/>\nhow to do things.

I think if he were alive today these<br/>\ndiscussions and ideas may<br/>\nchallenged his original thoughts about children and independence, and<br/>\nperhaps lead to a revision of Some of them. He seemed open to learning and<br/>\nwas progressive given the time he was writing. His school is progressive<br/>\ntoday when compared to other schools. Which is shocking. If course not<br/>\neveryone can unschool, I think it would be great if people who wanted to<br/>\nsend their children to school, either because it was preferred or because<br/>\nthey were unable to make the emotional and practical transition, could have<br/>\nthe option of sending their kids to a democratic school.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the deschooling process Charlie did start to feel as though I<br/>\nthought he couldn&#39;t manage things. He appreciated my support and actively<br/>\nasked for it to, and sometimes he said I&#39;m not a baby I can do it. Maybe I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t &#39;t partnering effectively, maybe when you stop expecting children to<br/>\ndo things that were previously expected ofthen, maybe because we rushed<br/>\ninto unschooling we found ourselves in that place. Things have changed, now<br/>\nCharlie has come to trust that it is my intention to be on his team and<br/>\nsupport him. Not restrict him or his independence. I am very glad we chose<br/>\nto Unschool, it has been transforming and a gift to us all, and although<br/>\nnot cheap, cheaper than Summerhill and we get to live, learn and grow<br/>\ntogether<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, 7 March 2013, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- In the home the child is always being taught.

Handwork is<br/>\ntoo often the making of a wooden box under the eye of an expert. Even the<br/>\nMontessori system, well known as a system of directed play, is an<br/>\nartificial way of making the child learn by doing. It has nothing creative<br/>\nabout it. In the home the child is always being taught. In almost every<br/>\nhome there is at least one ungrown-up grown-up who rushes to show Tommy how<br/>\nhis new engine works. There is always someone to lift the baby up on a<br/>\nchair when the baby wants to examine something on the wall. Every time we<br/>\nshow Tommy how his engine works we are stealing from that child the joy of<br/>\nlife � the joy of discovery � the joy of overcoming an obstacle. Worse! We<br/>\nmake that child come to believe that he is inferior, and must depend on<br/>\nhelp.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from Sandra Dodd, previous post:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;What unschooling provides is a child being at home, sleeping until he&#39;s<br/>\nslept long enough, eating or not eating without regard for the clock, not<br/>\nneeding to dress up a certain way most days, having access to an adult or<br/>\ntwo who love him and have a lot of time for him, being able to leave<br/>\nprojects out, being able to watch a DVD if he wants to, and pause it until<br/>\nlater, or just turn it off and walk away without asking everyone else if<br/>\nit&#39;s okay to pause it or change the channel.  Being home, a child can use<br/>\nthe internet.  He can go back to bed if he&#39;s tired or feels ill or<br/>\nstressed.&quot; ( brilliant!

You won&#39;t need to drive your kids places anymore!&quot;  Except school every day, if you want to avoid that public school transportation system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschooling provides is a child being at home, sleeping until he&#39;s slept long enough, eating or not eating without regard for the clock, not needing to dress up a certain way most days, having access to an adult or two who love him and have a lot of time for him, being able to leave projects out, being able to watch a DVD if he wants to, and pause it until later, or just turn it off and walk away without asking everyone else if it&#39;s okay to pause it or change the channel.  Being home, a child can use the internet.  He can go back to bed if he&#39;s tired or feels ill or stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are aspects of learning and living that people forget about when they claim that a school can provide what unschooling provides.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":489758490,"authorName":"bbllmm00","from":"&quot;bbllmm00&quot; &lt;bbllmm00@...&gt;","profile":"bbllmm00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"a new &#39;democratic&#39; school","postDate":"1362592333","msgId":70803,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtoN3ZvZCs5YW10QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70804,"prevInTime":70802,"nextInTime":70804,"topicId":70803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, for most of us who like a free style of learning for our kids, there is a school that just does that !
