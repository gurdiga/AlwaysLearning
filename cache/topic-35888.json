I also love how people try to clarify their thinking. <br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nJae<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found in the past that when something someone has written on a list<br/>\nthat is not directed to me personally, causes me to react strongly, it is<br/>\noften because it is something I need to give more thought. When I am firm<br/>\nin my belief in something, I don&#39;t generally react strongly to someone&#39;s<br/>\nchallenging ideas. I may acknowledge that I don&#39;t agree and then I easily<br/>\nmove on and it doesn&#39;t cause me to get angry or annoyed. I only get stuck<br/>\nwhen something digs at my conscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ourbigslife.blogspot.com\">http://www.ourbigslife.blogspot.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321729783,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: how to screw it up","postDate":"1214773639","msgId":36002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDNERDM0Y3NUM5QzRBRTY4NThBNEM4N0FERDAyRjMwQEVib255Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERBNjdDRTdELTU5QTMtNENFMS1COTEwLUY4RUI2MTc4ODIxREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35986,"nextInTopic":36012,"prevInTime":36001,"nextInTime":36003,"topicId":35888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have found in the past that when something someone has written on a list that is not directed to me personally, causes me to react strongly, it is often","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1757679198\">I have found in the past that when something someone has written on a list<br/>\nthat is not directed to me personally, causes me to react strongly, it is<br/>\noften because it is something I need to give more thought.

I choose to because I don&#39;t fancy living on the streets nor would I want that for my family.  My working hard enables us to play and do things we would not be able to do otherwise.  My cup is  full not empty.  It is a combination of air and water and it is my/our particular combination - every one has their own combination.  When I saw how I chose to go to work it really did help my attitude.  I was also grateful that I had a job - or that we both were not sick, etc. etc.  Reading about others in much worse conditions than I and how they triumph is a great inspiration for me - I just come across these stories now and then in the news paper, books, the internet, the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get to a place of the pity party for myself I give myself a shake and chose to focus on the joy.  No one ever promised me a rose garden - but I choose to bloom where I am planted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI once heard an analogy and it is a great analogy for this list, for us anyway (hubby and I):  An airplane pilot knows where he wants to end up and heads in the right direction.   Because he is always a bit off course, he uses his knowledge and constantly checks his instruments.  He makes minute corrections in his &quot;flying&quot; to stay the course and end up where he wants to.  If he did not make those minute corrections he would end up where he did not want to be.  I probably botched that in written form but I hope it conveys the message I wanted it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list helps me stay the course, constantly learning new ways of looking at things, trying them on for fit and keeping what is a good fit and setting aside for further contemplation that which rubs a sore spot.  This list is for learning; for stretching out of our comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: how to screw it up","postDate":"1214656324","msgId":35935,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxRTMzMzI2LTZFNDEtNDZDMC04NTVDLTBCNDc4RDY4RUY2REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxMTlCRDEzLTU2QjItNDA2Qy04Njc3LTczRTU4RERBQTdBMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGc0MzdzYisybG42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTExOUJEMTMtNTZCMi00MDZDLTg2NzctNzNFNThEREFBN0EwQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":35933,"nextInTopic":35946,"prevInTime":35934,"nextInTime":35936,"topicId":35888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-While those who put their all into something, sacrificing themselves in the process, often accomplish a lot, quite often they don t get the respect for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-833638318\">-=-While those who put their all into something, sacrificing themselves<br/>\nin the process, often accomplish a lot, quite often they don&#39;t get<br/>\nthe respect for their sacrifices they may end up feeling they<br/>\ndeserve.

(The kids might not though! All choices have  <br/>\nconsequences.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is for putting relationships first and finding ways to fit  <br/>\neverything else in around that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And with a knowledge of how to do things in the house!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So does my daughter.

Feeling we don&#39;t have a choice makes  <br/>\nus feel secure in what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s less work if we don&#39;t have a  <br/>\nchoice. But it&#39;s an illusion. Those who see something better and feel  <br/>\nthe effort needed to get there is worth it, do find other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule putting everyone else ahead of self isn&#39;t healthy.  <br/>\nNor should we be more important. Everyone should count, including  <br/>\nmom. When we take our own needs into consideration, we model caring  <br/>\nfor ourselves for our children. We free them from the guilt of  <br/>\n&quot;having to&quot; do for others. We allow them to joyfully choose to help  <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The problem is that often our &quot;needs&quot; are really old scripts that we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t realize have no meaning. That&#39;s why everything needs examined.  <br/>\nThough, when kids are little, we do need to set aside a lot (not all)  <br/>\nof our needs for a while. It&#39;s a stage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile those who put their all into something, sacrificing themselves  <br/>\nin the process, often accomplish a lot, quite often they don&#39;t get  <br/>\nthe respect for their sacrifices they may end up feeling they  <br/>\ndeserve. It creates resentment and anger. It creates moms who rail on  <br/>\nthe phone &quot;Why don&#39;t you call? You never call me! All the sacrifices  <br/>\nI made for you all those years and you can&#39;t pick up the phone?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people choose to sacrifice themselves, they should acknowledge  <br/>\nthat it&#39;s a gift they&#39;re joyfully giving with no strings attached.  <br/>\n*No one* has asked anyone to make sacrifices. *No one* will  <br/>\nappreciate the sacrifices for things they didn&#39;t ask someone to make  <br/>\nsacrifices for. (Especially if they&#39;re handed a &quot;bill&quot; at the end  <br/>\nwith a &quot;You owe me!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sympathetic to your situation but the list is for people to work  <br/>\non relationships, not create martyrs.

Would  <br/>\nthat be good? Would there be some satisfaction if everyone suffered  <br/>\nequally with no time to help others?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there *are* single working mothers who unschool who do find ways  <br/>\nto make advice here work. (Obviously, and unfortunately, they tend to  <br/>\nhave less time to write and help others figure out how to do it!)  <br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* helpful not to picture everyone on the list having an  <br/>\nintact family with working husband.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have no choices as well I&#39;ll do it tommorrow casue tommorw is  <br/>\n&gt; usally full with other other details to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You *choose* to wash your uniforms because you like that option  <br/>\nbetter than the option of wearing a dirty uniform. No one has every  <br/>\noption available. Not all options are equally good. But everyone has  <br/>\nchoices they make all the time. It&#39;s only when we dismiss the options  <br/>\nwe don&#39;t like as though they didn&#39;t exist that we feel trapped by  <br/>\n&quot;have tos&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think before you state things, you need to think of otherw who  <br/>\n&gt; may have to live differently than you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s supremely frustrating to feel your situation prevents  <br/>\nyou from using a lot of the advice offered.

They turned out just fine!And with a knowledge of how to <br/>\ndo things in the house!!!<br/>\nI do put myself last as my family is the most important things before <br/>\nme...There needs and wants are more than mine..My son will be 18 soon <br/>\nenough and he will be on his own and not need me then so i will do <br/>\nfor him now. My hubby is disabled and his needs are more than my <br/>\nneeds..life has been not a bowl of cherries but we will get through. <br/>\nMaybe you have it very, very easy ..but others may not. We may have <br/>\nto follow a schedule  and do our own house and laundry..I work full <br/>\ntime and have to do these things at times so that my uniforms are <br/>\nclean to wear to work and my work clothes are clean to wear to the <br/>\nother job I have. I have no choices as well I&#39;ll do it tommorrow <br/>\ncasue tommorw is usally full with other other details to do..DRs. <br/>\nappointments, homeschool trips, a hike, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not boring , nor do I have a  boring life! I do many things and <br/>\nlearn many new things along the way!  You may be very surprised At <br/>\nwhat you can find interesting and fun things at!  ANYWHERE AT ANY <br/>\nTIME! life is a struggle at times but I make the most of it, and I <br/>\nthink before you state things, you need to think of otherw who may <br/>\nhave to live differently than you. I did not choose to live like <br/>\nthis..I did not choose to have my hubby injured and then have many <br/>\nhealth problems, not did I choose to have cancer as I do. If I don&#39;t <br/>\nwork my full time job.. I lose my healthe benefits and then i don&#39;t <br/>\nget my treatments or my hubbys meds, testing paid for, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPebs<br/>\nLearningyahoogroups.com, Nancy Machaj &lt;nmachaj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be Boring.
