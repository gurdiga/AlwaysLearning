My always-unschooled daughter went to high school in 10th grade and now she&#39;s in 11th. Be willing to drive a carload of kids whenever there&#39;s an event. You can bring a book and hang out unobtrusively, or find somewhere nearby to get coffee, or even go home and go back to pick them all up if another parent won&#39;t share the driving. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has been amazed at how few parents will drive and facilitate their kids&#39; participation in events. Sometimes, there are events at school and kids are dropped off with no idea of how they&#39;ll get home! We have a standing agreement with our daughter that she can offer anyone a ride home, doesn&#39;t even need to call and ask. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe conversations in the car are fascinating! Just be a good listener, unless one of the kids asks you something. It&#39;s amazing how few of these kids have an adult to talk to, and they will seek you out. You&#39;ll have a great window into your daughter&#39;s life with her friends and you&#39;ll have that last leg of the trip after dropping the last kid off to talk alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Meg</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60263,"nextTopicId":60264}}
