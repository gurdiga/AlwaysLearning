This seems like a good list for it, as it certainly falls under<br/>\n&quot;Always Learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a program on The Discovery Channel called &quot;Assignment: Discovery.&quot;<br/>\nWe watch it in the morning, and often use it as a jumping-off point for<br/>\ndiscussion, a trip to the library, etc.  This week, the topic has been human<br/>\ngenetics.  One day, they showed the separated twins research that has been<br/>\ngoing on for many years.  It shows how the personality, as well as physical<br/>\ntraits, are inherited: two girls, for instance, one raised in wealth and<br/>\nwith the &quot;best&quot; parenting, the other in poverty and neglect, nonetheless<br/>\ndeveloped the same mental pathologies and learning disablilities.<br/>\nUpbringing had nothing to do with it.  And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was surprising to the researchers was that separated twins very often<br/>\nhad the same spiritual leanings.  Two women in Britain, for instance, who<br/>\nwere not raised in it, chose Evangelical Christianity as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom was raised in a Seventh-Day Adventist home, but was never baptized;<br/>\nthe minister said she had &quot;too many questions.&quot;  Her mother was horrified<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  Much later in life (about 20 years ago), my mom learned that her father<br/>\nwas, er, not her father.  Her mother had gotten pregnant at age 14 by a 22<br/>\ny.o. (she&#39;d lied about her age to him), and he fled to Mexico.  After<br/>\nlearning about her true paternity, mom went hunting for him.  She finally<br/>\ntracked down the right man, too late to meet him before his death, but did<br/>\nfind her half-brother.  She learned that her real dad was a Religious<br/>\nScientist -- as she had been since her 30&#39;s.  That is not a common religion;<br/>\nit seems unlikely mere coincidence would draw them to the same beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a very religious person since my late teens, but also prone to<br/>\ndepression.  During those periods, God simply disappears.  No contact, no<br/>\nfaith, no desire for Him.  He simply no longer exists.  My husband became<br/>\nvery depressed a couple of years ago, and stopped going to church; he put<br/>\nit, &quot;Church doesn&#39;t do it for me anymore.&quot;  I&#39;ve known other religious<br/>\npeople who &quot;lose their faith&quot; during depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are people who never need faith of any kind, it seems.  In my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s family, there are a few religious people, and a number of those<br/>\nwho are either indifferent, atheists, or rationalists.  There are also a<br/>\nnumber of scientists; in my family visual artists dominate, and the missing<br/>\ngrandfather, as it turns out, was a photographer with a wild sense of humor<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  That explains a lot :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questions rattling in my head are -- Does faith depend on heredity?  Is<br/>\nthere a brain structure or function which governs &quot;God&quot;?  If a person who is<br/>\nreligious can become an atheist because of depression, does it mean that<br/>\nfaith, or the perception of God, or spirituality, is controlled by some<br/>\nfunction of the brain, which depression interrupts?  Do closed societies<br/>\n(the Amish, for instance) maintain their religion because the propensity to<br/>\nit is inherited?  Is there a &quot;God gene&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean that God does not exist,<br/>\nthat our perceptions are delusions which plague some but not others, or does<br/>\nit mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created these structures or<br/>\nfunctions in order to have contact with us?  And does it mean that those<br/>\nwithout the capacity to perceive him are damned?  Or, if he is just, that<br/>\nthose without the gene are equally saved without religion, since it would be<br/>\nunfair otherwise?  (I&#39;m using saved and damned in a general sense, as most<br/>\nreligions promise some kind of reward for participation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what of religions that practice meditation, or use drugs sacramentally?<br/>\nMy religion&#39;s hagiography is replete with saints whose visions could be just<br/>\nas easily described as hallucinations; were they just nuts, or can severe<br/>\nfasting account for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to ponder at this season of The Incarnation ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Stepping in the SECOND hornet&#39;s nest","postDate":"1008342270","msgId":681,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2MS41OWY1YTQ3LjI5NGI2ZWZlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":718,"prevInTime":680,"nextInTime":682,"topicId":681,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Yes.
