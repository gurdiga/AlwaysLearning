Kirby was at work, and Marty had gone to thrift stores <br/>\nwith friends (which turned into being gone for hours, which was okay).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith came downstairs and said &quot;Holly&#39;s watching a movie in Spanish.&quot;  Keith <br/>\nand I were watching some movie, I forget what, and eating in the den, and <br/>\njust hanging out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly came down and said with some determination that she wanted me to find <br/>\nout what movie she had just watched.  She said she had written part of the <br/>\nname down but couldn&#39;t get it all, and would like for me to find it on video <br/>\nand rent it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had written down:  Cine de las...<br/>\n<br/>\nOoops.  &quot;Holly, that&#39;s &#39;Movie of the...&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe laughed, but she was bummed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to always get TV guide, but quit a few years ago.  So I got online to <br/>\nsee if I could find the schedule.  Couldn&#39;t.  Not for either Spanish-language <br/>\nchannel here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was 9:00 Saturday night, and I figured we could go to the store and look <br/>\nin the TV Guide.   Keith thought that was a weird thing to do, but he&#39;s used <br/>\nto us.  I said I hoped we could find it on DVD with English subtitles, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n So we went to John Brooks, a little grocery just 1/4 mile away.  They were <br/>\nall out of TV Guide. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to Raley&#39;s, half a mile away.  They were almost out of TV Guide but <br/>\nwe found one.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThese stations are both UHF, so you can&#39;t count on what channel they&#39;ll come <br/>\nin on and what she was getting on her TV wasn&#39;t what was in the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two movies in Spanish which had started at 7:00.   One was about <br/>\ntravellers to the Australian outback who meet a crazy dangerous guy in the <br/>\ndesert, as far as I could tell, reading what Spanish I could read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t it, she said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other was called &quot;Daniel el Travieso.&quot;  I had no idea about &quot;travieso,&quot; <br/>\nbut at least we had a likely movie.  &quot;Was his name Daniel?&quot; I asked, <br/>\npronouncing it in Spanish.<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay.  I was reading through the TV-Guide blurb, and all I could tell was it <br/>\nwas a little kid who did blah blah, I didn&#39;t know what, to his neighbor Mr. <br/>\nWilson.   Played by Walter Matthau.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Holly! This is &#39;Dennis the Menace!&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s an American movie.  Used to be a comic in the newspaper.  Come on!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween Raley&#39;s and our house was Hollywood Video.  Holly was pretty <br/>\nskeptical about my whole theory, but I found the box, showed her the picture, <br/>\nand she said yes, that was the one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mystery solved, and I didn&#39;t even have to drive across town to find a <br/>\nvideo store with a big section of Mexican cowboy movies and comedies to try <br/>\nto look through in Spanish alphabetical order (though &quot;D&quot; for Daniel would <br/>\nhave been okay).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has been watching Back to the Future movies lots of late, and <br/>\nChristopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson are both in Dennis the Menace and the <br/>\nothers as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor Holly, I paid attention to her and produced what she wanted within an <br/>\nhour.  That can&#39;t always happen, so I&#39;m glad I did.  And I got to show her an <br/>\nexample of creative use of reference materials. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13091,"nextTopicId":13097}}
