I tried for a number of years to help a woman <br/>\nwith her autistic son to give her resources that the schools weren&#39;t <br/>\ngiving her and the ones they were, were clearly not helping her.  She <br/>\npolitely took them and did nothing.  However, the last I heard she <br/>\nhad taken her child out of the school system to homeschool, so maybe <br/>\nsomething I said or gave her helped after all.  I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave much contact with her anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another friend that I really enjoy, for other reasons, that is <br/>\nheavily attatched to the labels too.  I just have to let it go, <br/>\nbecause she doesn&#39;t hear what I tell her.  You can&#39;t make someone see <br/>\nsomething they aren&#39;t ready to see or hear.

Part of <br/>\ngetting along in the world is accepting people that are different and <br/>\nstill be able to acknowledge what they do have to offer.  Our kids <br/>\nare no exception to this.  When my kids are visitors in someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s home like an aunt, they should follow house rules, wether they <br/>\nlike it or not.  They don&#39;t have to tolerate abuse, like yelling, but <br/>\nthey can address it through me if they don&#39;t feel comfortable doing <br/>\nit directly to their aunt.(we don&#39;t really have aunts like this)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe pros are having a relationship with their cousins.  If you are <br/>\nable to go with them, I would, to run interference when things get <br/>\nugly so your kids can enjoy their time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also fear that if it becomes widespread knowledge among his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>other  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; relatives that our oldest is not yet reading, some sort of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pressure  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will start.

I ask my kids for help all the <br/>\ntime and most of the time they willingly help.  Set a timer and say <br/>\n10 min pickup.  It&#39;s amazing how much can be picked up in that amount <br/>\nof time.  When they don&#39;t want to help for whatever reason, I ask <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t get anything more out right now and give me 15 solid <br/>\nuninterrupted minutes for me to do it myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLearn quick decluttering tricks so that it doesn&#39;t cause you stress <br/>\nand guilt about having a house that isn&#39;t the tidiest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh yes, our 3yo also can frequently be found running around in our  <br/>\n&gt; home naked, and that definitely puts some people off, so I&#39;m <br/>\n </span></blockquote>feeling  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like it&#39;s created some awkwardness, despite the fact that I can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>say  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that it&#39;s easier for him while he&#39;s learning to use the bathroom  <br/>\n&gt; regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I can say that I completely understand this issue.

Over the last few months  <br/>\nI have been mulling over a possible post, and just haven&#39;t gotten  <br/>\nthere, but this is opening the door for me.  I think part of the  <br/>\nreason that I have hesitated to post is that I still feel unclear  <br/>\nabout what my specific issue is, but here goes anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I have just been feeling like we have so many differences  <br/>\nbetween us and everyone that we know (except our unschooling  <br/>\nfriends), and I have been wondering if I (because it&#39;s me driving the  <br/>\nunschooling, right) am going to alienate everyone we know because of  <br/>\nour &quot;crazy&quot; choices.  Here are some scenarios and background info.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest is 8.5, and definitely not reading, not even a small list  <br/>\nof words, actually.  She recognizes things that she sees, like logos,  <br/>\netc., but if they are presented in another way, she doesn&#39;t recognize  <br/>\nthem at all.  I&#39;ve read on this list, I&#39;ve read Frank Smith, and I  <br/>\nreally feel comfortable that she is going to get to it in her own  <br/>\nway.  She&#39;s always done things kind of slowly and waited until real  <br/>\nmastery was possible before she commits to doing them fully.  Because  <br/>\nof that, I trust that she will be there, and do just fine when it  <br/>\nworks for her.  I also can see how much information she (and my other  <br/>\ntwo children also) absorb from the world without even needing to  <br/>\nread.  They notice everything and are so conscious of the visual  <br/>\nworld around them, it is remarkable to me.  But, on the reading  <br/>\nfront, we are definitely coming up on those situations, either with  <br/>\nrelatives, or with non-unschooling friends, or casual acquaintances,  <br/>\nwhere there is a slightly uncomfortable pause and look when they  <br/>\nrealize that our 8.5 yo does not yet know how to read.  With the  <br/>\nfamily and close folks, I feel relatively comfortable explaining the  <br/>\ndetail of the situation, our philosophy, etc.; it is those more  <br/>\ncasual encounters (with acquaintances at dinner, with the lifeguard  <br/>\nat the pool, etc.) where I need some brief statement that I can make  <br/>\nthat keeps me and the situation positive, does not require a detailed  <br/>\nlecture on the whole natural learning philosophy, and is not  <br/>\nuncomfortable for my daughter to hear.  Generally, when it seems to  <br/>\nmake sense, I say something like &quot;oh yes, homeschooled children who  <br/>\nlearn to read naturally at their own pace often do not read until  <br/>\nbetween 8 and 12 years old.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral months ago, I realized that two of my oldest friends from  <br/>\ncollege might be too difficult for me to see and talk to on a regular  <br/>\nbasis.  I feel very uncomfortable in the presence of their sometimes  <br/>\nnegative, heavily directive parenting.  Aside from the parentinng  <br/>\nstyle, they both have boys who are diagnosed with certain currently  <br/>\ncommon disorders and in numerous types of therapy, but seem to me to  <br/>\njust be maybe a little unique or needing more individual attention,  <br/>\nand the treatment is all to have them fit into a school or preshool  <br/>\nbox (sorry, I do not mean to create controversy here, it just seems  <br/>\nto me that I do not know a little boy who is not diagnosed with  <br/>\nsomething these days, and it is making me skeptical.)   One of the  <br/>\nfriends and I discussed that our different views on parenting (she  <br/>\nexpressed reading concerns; I did not share my views on disorders)  <br/>\nwere causing some stress in the relationship, and I told her that if  <br/>\nit was causing too much stress for her, I would understand if she  <br/>\nwanted to drop our friendship.  I also tried to gently share that I  <br/>\nwas really seeing so many great possible benefits about the learning  <br/>\nand relationship style that we were exploring, that I would love it  <br/>\nif she could see those too.  We haven&#39;t really talked since that  <br/>\nconversation, and it is kind of eating at me.  This conversation was  <br/>\nextremely difficult for me, as I typically avoid controversy and try  <br/>\nto keep to the positive side of things, but it seemed like it had to  <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s family is another situation.  Almost every single person  <br/>\nis an educator, and with that background, obviously our choice was  <br/>\ndifferent.  However, I think most of the folks looked at my husband  <br/>\nand I and said, well, they were both reasonably bright and motivated,  <br/>\nthey must have some idea of what they&#39;re doing.  On the other hand,  <br/>\nmy sil is an extremely dictatorial parent, barking out orders to her  <br/>\n11 and 9 year olds, about everything from what they need to do next,  <br/>\nto what they can and can&#39;t eat, etc.  It is so painful for me to  <br/>\nobserve, and I could almost cry for the lost potential of her  <br/>\nchildren, especially her son, who receives extremely negative  <br/>\ntreatment.  Recently they visited and stayed with us for several  <br/>\ndays, along with my mil, her older daughter and boyfriend, and their  <br/>\nother children.  We joined some other relatives for a dinner at our  <br/>\nbotanic garden, and while we were walking around afterward, my  <br/>\nhusband overheard our sil commenting to his cousin that she told my  <br/>\n3yo that he &quot;couldn&#39;t do such and such with Auntie Sarah around.&quot;  My  <br/>\nhusband did not hear the entire conversation, but thought it referred  <br/>\nto a time where my son might have been jumping on piled up air  <br/>\nmattresses while she was in the room reading, and he inferred that  <br/>\nshe thought he needed someone to tell him a strong &quot;NO&quot;.  I can tell  <br/>\nthat it seems strange to others in their family that I spend so much  <br/>\ntime talking, acknowledging emotions and negotiating with all of our  <br/>\nchildren, but probably mostly with the 3yo.  This sil has in the past  <br/>\nalso asked kind of point blank questions of my daughter about what  <br/>\nshe&#39;s been learning.  This sil suggested during a car ride with her  <br/>\nand my mil, that our daughters should come to visit them alone for a  <br/>\nweek next summer.  I could barely say anything, because I felt so  <br/>\nworried for them that any such visit might include probing of their  <br/>\nknowledge base, lessons in how to listen and follow orders, and also  <br/>\nhow to be responsible for cleaning up your own messes.  On the other  <br/>\nhand, I felt like I would seem like an ogre of a mother to deprive  <br/>\nthem of the opportunity to have a week of fun and excitement with  <br/>\ntheir cousins.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also fear that if it becomes widespread knowledge among his other  <br/>\nrelatives that our oldest is not yet reading, some sort of pressure  <br/>\nwill start.  When we first mentioned that our daughter might not read  <br/>\nuntil 8 or so, dh&#39;s mother said &quot;well I certainly hope it doesn&#39;t go  <br/>\nthat far&quot;.  She seemed okay at 5, 6, 7, but with each year, I am sure  <br/>\nit will become more of a concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the reading and the toddler negotiating, there is always  <br/>\nthe background hum of some level of guilt that our home can be very  <br/>\nmessy (and the kids are not required to pick things up, which I can  <br/>\ntell creates some discomfort, even with our closest friends), and I  <br/>\noften feel like I have to make some explanatory comment to whomever  <br/>\nmight be coming to our door, whether they be our building engineer, a  <br/>\nneighbor in need of something, or friends.  I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t  <br/>\nget over the mentality of guilt - I have so many valid arguments  <br/>\nagainst it, but try as I might, it does crop up.  We did do major  <br/>\ncleanup for our relatives, but with so many people living there, it  <br/>\nwas messy, and I still didn&#39;t go around cleaning everything every  <br/>\nminute.  My sil somehow made a comment about how she hates clutter,  <br/>\nand I wondered if that was somehow directed at me, because our house  <br/>\nis cluttery by most people&#39;s standards.  Perhaps though, I might have  <br/>\nbeen too sensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, our 3yo also can frequently be found running around in our  <br/>\nhome naked, and that definitely puts some people off, so I&#39;m feeling  <br/>\nlike it&#39;s created some awkwardness, despite the fact that I can say  <br/>\nthat it&#39;s easier for him while he&#39;s learning to use the bathroom  <br/>\nregularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast, but not least, and I think that Jacki articulated this so well  <br/>\nin her draft response to the op, our children are not perfect, and  <br/>\ntheir behavior is not always what others want to see.  They can be  <br/>\ntruly charming at times, but when they are home and in their comfort  <br/>\nzone, they can also be very emotional, expressive and intense.  I  <br/>\nknow that there are people who witness this and think that there  <br/>\nmight be something wrong with it, and we need to get them under  <br/>\ncontrol.  As we have progressed in our journey, I have learned to see  <br/>\nthe value of not trying to shut down or &quot;fix&quot; their emotions,  <br/>\nreactions and behaviors, but rather to try to understand and help  <br/>\nthem understand what they are experiencing, and to let them be  <br/>\ngenuine, not compliant and acceptable to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so now I&#39;ve got old friends, family and casual acquaintances  <br/>\nall sending out subtle or not completely subtle messages that  <br/>\nsomething seems a bit off about this, and I&#39;m not feeling so great  <br/>\nabout what they&#39;re doing that it&#39;s making me feel a little bit stiff  <br/>\nin my relationships, and maybe even a little prepared to be  <br/>\ndefensive, which is not where I&#39;d like to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help if we were more closely connected with our local  <br/>\nhomeschool community, but the get-togethers tend to be very large,  <br/>\nand my daughters do not enjoy going to huge open gym activities.    <br/>\nThey prefer one-on-one activities, and the few friends that they have  <br/>\ndecided are the easiest and best to get together with are several  <br/>\nschooled children, fortunately with very nice and understanding  <br/>\nmothers, who live close by and can be played with more regularly.  We  <br/>\nalso live a little further from the bigger cluster of our homeschool  <br/>\ngroup&#39;s families.  So the two friends are great, but we&#39;re definitely  <br/>\npursuing our own activities much of the time.  I love this, on the  <br/>\none hand, because it is great to do what we want, and I feel like we  <br/>\nare connecting so much more with the kids interests, but given the  <br/>\nabove, I wonder if my ability to be confident with doubtful parties  <br/>\ncould be improved more by day to day reinforcement that unschooling  <br/>\nis great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many positives about our unschooling experience that I  <br/>\ncould go on and on with an equally long email (and then you&#39;d kick me  <br/>\noff the list), but I think I need to get this concern out of the way  <br/>\nso that I can focus on those and be confident and smooth with the  <br/>\nothers that might not feel that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts very much appreciated,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1675643,"authorName":"Cally Brown","from":"Cally Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","profile":"cally_marg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unsolicited advice!","postDate":"1185824228","msgId":30123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2QUUzREU0LjYwODA0MDdAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlEMzA1ODNFLTkxRTItNEY1QS1CMkYyLUVGOTE4NDZGMjQ4QUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGY4a3VmZCs2djdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OUQzMDU4M0UtOTFFMi00RjVBLUIyRjItRUY5MTg0NkYyNDhBQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":30122,"nextInTopic":30126,"prevInTime":30122,"nextInTime":30124,"topicId":30102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have a friend who is very much invested in the schooling <br/>\nsystem.  She absolutely hates public schools, for many of the same <br/>\nreasons that I do, but where we differ is that she still feels that <br/>\nkids must be taught.  At heart she is a teacher, she just feels <br/>\nschools don&#39;t teach well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way for her to understand what we do and I simply don&#39;t <br/>\ngo there with her.  When my older daughter was young she really liked <br/>\nthis friend.  Little kids really like her, her expectations are very <br/>\nclear and there isn&#39;t any misunderstandings with her.  As my daughter <br/>\ngrew, the expectations stayed the same and there were many <br/>\nmisunderstandings because this friend of mine expected my now older <br/>\ndaughter to behave a certain way that wasn&#39;t reasonable or respectful <br/>\nof my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt belittling to her and she stopped wanting to be around this <br/>\nperson at all.  I didn&#39;t force her.  When I started meeting her at a <br/>\nlocal coffee shop Chamille started to want to come, not to see this <br/>\nperson, but to go to the cafe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel oddly uncomfortable with my daughter and this friend <br/>\ntogether.  One day when we were at the cafe, Chamille asked if I <br/>\ncould retreive her coffee from the counter for her.  I asked her to <br/>\ndo it please and she got really upset at this, so I went and got it <br/>\nfor her.  Later I asked her to get something for me from the car and <br/>\nshe said &quot;no&quot;, and went on to say, &quot;now you know how it feels&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was so incredibly powerful.  The thing is, it didn&#39;t make me <br/>\nmad, it made me think.  My friend was just beside herself over the <br/>\nwhole thing letting me know how disrespectful my daughter is/was and <br/>\nthat I needed to make her be more respectful.  She went on about it <br/>\nexplaining all that I was doing wrong as a parent, etc etc.  I <br/>\nlistened politely and told her I would deal with the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what happened in the car on the way home... I dealt with the <br/>\nsituation.  I let my daughter know that she was absolutely right and <br/>\nthat I indeed had behaved disrespectfuly towards her by not getting <br/>\nher what she had politely asked me to get, and then asking her to do <br/>\nsomething for me and expecting her to do it, when I had been <br/>\nunwilling to do what she had asked, even though I eventually did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we were both crying about it because it was such an intense <br/>\nmoment.  She had every right to be upset with me, especially after <br/>\nsitting there listening to this friend of mine lecture me about <br/>\nrespect and how to make my daughter respect me and others.  My <br/>\ndaughter has absolutely no respect for this woman.  However, I think <br/>\nshe has a great deal of respect for me, primaraly because I have a <br/>\ngreat deal of respect for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe made an agreement about this friend of mine.  I told my daughter <br/>\nthat she will always come first, and that my friend is an adult and <br/>\ncan deal with it.  She never ever has to come with me to see this <br/>\nperson, and if I need to cancel with my friend because my daughter <br/>\nneeds me, then I won&#39;t hesitate to do so, even if it creates <br/>\nweirdness in the friendship.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille and I had a long hearfelt conversation about all this.  She <br/>\nagreed that if for some reason she had to be around this person that, <br/>\nif for whatever reason, she was feeling disrespected, she would pull <br/>\nme aside and discuss it away from this person instead of in front of <br/>\nher so that it wouldn&#39;t insue into another lecture of respect.  She <br/>\nagreed to smile politely and to try to keep her mouth shut and ignore <br/>\nher as much as possible, and that we would plan in advance to bring <br/>\nheadphones and drawing paper and such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing though, I haven&#39;t seen this friend for many months <br/>\nbecause my kids come first.

It is clear<br/>\nthat we think differently about parenting, and just as I am sure you have<br/>\nreasons for making the choices that you have made, so do I. Both of our<br/>\nideas can be strongly supported with studies and evidence. I know the course<br/>\nthat you recommend intimately. My decisions have come from personal<br/>\nexperience, many others&#39; personal experiences, from seeing the results of<br/>\nthat course on the majority of the population, and from seeing many families<br/>\nwho have chosen to give freedom and respect to their children over many<br/>\nyears. My family&#39;s journey is an exciting one, not based in the box of &quot;one<br/>\nsize fits all&quot;, a box that has created misery for many, many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may not see my children as &quot;pleasures&quot; to be with, and that is<br/>\nokay...they are growing and learning, and I don&#39;t know if they will ever<br/>\nmeet your standards for &quot;pleasure&quot;. I do not believe that children should be<br/>\nexpected to always be pleasures to be with. I mean, sure, that would serve a<br/>\ngreat purpose for us adults, but I&#39;m pretty sure that is not what is in<br/>\ntheir best interest. My kids  are learning about society and expectations<br/>\nover time, with loving guidance along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I like people to be themselves, whether they are pleasant or<br/>\nnot. It seems that adults are not always expected to be pleasant. While it<br/>\nis my hope that my children will grow into people that are great to be<br/>\naround, the process is not automatic and may not always look pretty to<br/>\neveryone. I have no desire to choose false beauty over real life and<br/>\nlearning. My kids are learning what is acceptable in this society over time,<br/>\nhow to respect by being respected,  compassion by being well taken care of<br/>\nand by being supported...it&#39;s all happening. It isn&#39;t a lesson that is<br/>\nlearned with a quick scary look, or yell, or swat...it is learned over time<br/>\nwith respectful behavior and guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve chosen a path where my kids are learning about the world and who<br/>\nthey are through freedom, support, and guidance. As their passions and<br/>\ninterests are being supported and fed, as they have the freedom to explore<br/>\nand daydream, as they have supportive adults to help them along the way,<br/>\nthey learn in peace and contentedness. I understand that this isn&#39;t an<br/>\nauthoritative or conventional approach. I do not believe in an authoritative<br/>\napproach in most situations. I believe the authoritative approach causes<br/>\nmore damage than health, especially in relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is a deal-breaker or not with our friendship.

Now I see that she and I have very different<br/>\napproaches to raising children!  She thinks my daughter, Lauren (8),<br/>\nneeds to be in school.  Here is part of an e-mail she sent to me: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My concerns regarding Lauren involve Ian as well as what you and Tim<br/>\ncan reasonably manage as parents. Not only from the financial point of<br/>\nview, but also the time and energy drain on you, and problems with<br/>\nIan&#39;s safety and well-being. This is what prompted my discussion with<br/>\nLauren about the golden rule: you know - the one I was asked to<br/>\napologize to Lauren over because I &#39;hurt her feelings&#39; and &#39;yelled&#39; at<br/>\nher. Interesting having a 7-year-old in charge, eh? Maybe not so much<br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs your good friend, and someone who has successfully invested a lot<br/>\nin raising two daughters (that are a pleasure for other people to be<br/>\naround - don&#39;t you agree?) I offer you the best advice I know of: put<br/>\nLauren in school (while you have this small window of opportunity).<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to re-invent the wheel of her education, fortunately:<br/>\ntake advantage of a system that knows how to teach reading, and when<br/>\nLauren&#39;s illiteracy problem is solved you can always consider other<br/>\noptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if Lauren is brought into line with the structure and discipline<br/>\nshe requires, and if she can learn to relate to others in a healthy<br/>\nway (rather than constantly manipulating), then raising Ian will be so<br/>\nmuch easier. I really want the best for all of you...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you believe her?  What is she thinking...I didn&#39;t ask for her<br/>\nadvice.  I am so irritated and taken aback by her message that I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what to think.  Apparently she has an authoritative approach to<br/>\nchildren and I never knew this before.<br/>\nAny thoughts?  How would you handle this?  I&#39;m thinking the best<br/>\nresponse may be none at all.<br/>\nThanks!,<br/>\nDeanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30124,"nextTopicId":30131}}
