His<br/>\nfirst four/five years of formal education consisted of traditional,<br/>\nschool-at-home, curriculum-based, heavy-duty<br/>\nsit-at-your-desk-and-pay-attention WORK.  We started backing off all that<br/>\nlast year at this time.  Slowly, through the year, I have deconstructed his<br/>\nschooling environment.  We&#39;ve changed a lot at our house: parenting<br/>\ninteractions, activities, following his passions, etc.  There&#39;s been a lot<br/>\nmore to it than that, and it&#39;s all been very intentional, but that&#39;s a topic<br/>\nfor another post.  I&#39;ve had a lot of pressure from the people around us (his<br/>\ngrandmother, primarily, who used to teach him) to make sure he&#39;s &quot;doing what<br/>\nhe&#39;s supposed to.&quot;  I mostly ignore all that.  We haven&#39;t done ANY formal<br/>\nwriting lessons (reports, grammar, spelling, journaling, etc.) or anything<br/>\nlike that for over a year.  I&#39;m a big writer.  I always have a journal with<br/>\nme, and I like jotting down notes and lists and stuff.  Over this past year,<br/>\nI have really let go of the idea that J has to write, or be taught how to<br/>\nwrite, or be taught how to enjoy writing.  He can write, and be understood<br/>\nthrough writing, but we no longer make him write.  If he wants to, he can,<br/>\nand if he asks for help, we give it, gladly.  But we just don&#39;t talk about<br/>\nit or worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo days ago, we were all sitting around doing our own thing (it was a lazy<br/>\nSunday), and kind of enjoying the cozy living room, with the Christmas<br/>\ndecorations recently up.  J ran into the other room, where we have a shelf<br/>\nfull of empty notebooks, pencils, pens, crayons, markers, art stuff, books<br/>\nwith craft ideas, etc., and grabbed an empty notebook.  He scurried up onto<br/>\nthe couch with his pencil and notebook, and cuddled in a throw, and started<br/>\nscribbling in the notebook.  I didn&#39;t pay a whole lot of attention, but<br/>\nnoticed he looked pretty content.  A little while later, he said, &quot;D, you<br/>\nknow what I&#39;m doing?&quot;  I said, &quot;What?&quot;  He said, &quot;I&#39;m writing all the stuff<br/>\nthat happened today, and all the stuff that happened yesterday, like you<br/>\nalways do.  And then I&#39;m going to make a list of things to do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have knocked me over.  It was like he had discovered that he could<br/>\nkeep track of things by writing them down -- all by himself.  And he was so<br/>\npleased.  I said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool,&quot; nonchalantly.  And I really feel like<br/>\nI&#39;ve let go of the underlying voice that wants to say, &quot;Oh, sweet, we can<br/>\nturn this into a language arts lesson!&quot;  If he never picks up the notebook<br/>\nagain, that&#39;s fine.  Or if he leaves it laying around for a couple weeks and<br/>\nthen rediscovers it, that&#39;s okay, too.  His dad doesn&#39;t write, or get<br/>\nanything from writing, so...if J does, that&#39;s cool that he&#39;s discovered it.<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s really okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo (regarding TV and connections):  we&#39;ve taken all limits off TV, not that<br/>\nwe had a lot to begin with, but I definitely was carrying around some<br/>\nconcerns about my babies (20 months and 6 months) having too much<br/>\nscreen-time.  I&#39;ve dropped all that.  My 20 month old loves The Wiggles and<br/>\nBarney, and we play the same episodes over and over and over on Netflix for<br/>\nher.  Sometimes she sits mesmerized watching, sometimes she plays at other<br/>\nthings with it in the background, only stopping to dance to her favorite<br/>\nsongs.  J, the 10-year-old, is usually around while the shows are on, and<br/>\ntoday, we were watching a Wiggles Christmas show.  The guys, who are<br/>\nAustralian, were singing a song about Christmas in Australia being warm and<br/>\nsunny.  J, amazed, looked at me and said, &quot;they don&#39;t have snow in<br/>\nAustralia?&quot;  Which began this entire conversation about the climate in<br/>\nAustralia, the northern and southern hemispheres, why it might be snowing in<br/>\nArgentina in June, why places closer to the equator, whether north or south,<br/>\nare hotter all the time, etc. etc. etc. why it&#39;s cold at the south pole AND<br/>\nthe north pole.  All these questions and explorations online and with our<br/>\nglobe came up, all started by J, because of a Wiggles show.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had this memory of being 10, in the 5th grade, and being shamed<br/>\nbecause I answered a question wrong on a test about the north and south<br/>\npoles.  For some reason, I believed that *south* meant *hot,* because in my<br/>\nexperience, traveling to the south from Indiana, it got warmer.  I just<br/>\nextrapolated that to the south pole -- it must be hot there.  Whatever we<br/>\nhad been told from the textbook or whatever, had gone in one ear and out<br/>\nagain, because my real, true experience was that it is hot the farther south<br/>\nyou go.   I just remember my teacher laughing at me, and shaming me about<br/>\nit.  And I&#39;m so, so glad that J has the opportunity to learn about this<br/>\nstuff when he wants to, when it fits and is connected to things he&#39;s<br/>\nthinking about, without being tested, without being shamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d share.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\nCaitlin, 15<br/>\nJulian, 10<br/>\nJosephine, 20 months<br/>\nAutumn, 6 months<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58208,"nextTopicId":58181}}
