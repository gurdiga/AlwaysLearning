These <br/>\nwomen were all much older than she was, but they had done no research at <br/>\nall into how they were going to parent their children.  They were basically <br/>\nfollowing the usual methods of our culture.  They were always looking down <br/>\ntheir noses at her and her &quot;weird&quot; ideas.  (attachment parenting, etc.) <br/>\nThey may have had more life experience, but they didn&#39;t have more smarts <br/>\nthan she did.  She was a very mature young woman at that point.
