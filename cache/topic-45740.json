I<br/>\nthink people get attached to their posts and need to defend it over and over<br/>\nand that defeats the purpose of the group. Rachael needs to stop posting too<br/>\nand read more. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m fairly new to unschooling too, but I don&#39;t see how asking unschoolers<br/>\nhow often things go wrong, when we&#39;ve lost it, if we&#39;ve ever doubted this<br/>\npath, or what limits we impose really helps ANYONE who is on the path of<br/>\nradical unschooling (the whole purpose of that site) or at least who wants<br/>\nto be/stay on it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSure, I&#39;ve had moments I&#39;m not so proud of, where I wished I could have been<br/>\ncalmer with my son or done things differently. But I don&#39;t need to share<br/>\nthem with others or dwell on them! Now that I think about it, those moments<br/>\nare fewer and farther between than they used to be, before I was really<br/>\nmaking an effort towards the radicalness of unschooling (and I was already<br/>\ninto AP since becoming a mother, am still cosleeping with and occasionally<br/>\nnursing my almost 5yo, so I&#39;m no stranger to an alternate lifestyle!). I<br/>\ndon&#39;t need affirmation that RU is hard. I only share my problems or tough<br/>\nmoments when I&#39;m truely at a loss for what I could have done differently<br/>\nbecause I just can&#39;t seem to think of another way on my own, I&#39;m too close<br/>\nto it. Others who are not attached to my situation can often see more<br/>\nclearly and offer great solutions or ideas that have worked for them, that<br/>\nmay or may not work for me, and I am grateful for all of them. Some ideas<br/>\nsit in my head and maybe don&#39;t work now, but do work further down the road! <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat really helps me is when people share the moments where RU DOES work. It<br/>\nmay sound strange to a newbie (as I was a year ago!) but it helps a great<br/>\ndeal to carry around in my head happy thoughts and images of what other<br/>\nparents are doing out there or have done that portray a happy life with<br/>\ntheir children. (Going to a conference helps a ton! You get to SEE it in<br/>\nperson!) If you are always thinking of ways to make things more positive,<br/>\nyou WILL.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t see how going around with images of how many other parents are<br/>\nyelling at, grabbing too hard, shaming, or generally controlling their<br/>\nchildren would be helpful. It might give one a false sense of support, just<br/>\nknowing that they are not the only ones out there who mess up and can&#39;t seem<br/>\nto parent the way they want to. If you are always thinking of how it&#39;s OK to<br/>\nmess up because so many other parents are also messing up, you will mess up<br/>\nmore and more and think it&#39;s OK because you&#39;re not the only one. That&#39;s not<br/>\ngoing to get you where you want to be! (Unless you really want to be<br/>\nmiserable and have unhappy kids. But I don&#39;t think anyone on a list or group<br/>\nfor RU really wants that, they just don&#39;t know how else to be.)<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId\">http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId</a><br/>\n=45742/stime=1244317557/nc1=1/nc2=2/nc3=3&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Joyce being awesome again (and Sylvia)","postDate":"1244317484","msgId":45742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgwZWd2Yyt1dGtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhFMDZCNDlDLTVCMDYtNEFDMi04Rjc4LTE4MDNGQkQxRTJCN0BTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45740,"nextInTopic":45743,"prevInTime":45741,"nextInTime":45743,"topicId":45740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
