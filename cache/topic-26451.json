But we&#39;ve been going virtually every week for<br/>\n2.5 years! He wasn&#39;t particularly happy with the new group. He didn&#39;t think<br/>\nthe children his age (who happened to be new to homeschooling and were<br/>\nprobably uncomfortable themselves!) were particularly nice. He&#39;s never been<br/>\nto school or preschool and he sees the common sophistication/cynicism of<br/>\nmany schooled children his age as rude. He also came in with certain<br/>\nexpectation for what park days should be like -- and it&#39;ll take a while<br/>\nbefore they&#39;re approaching what he has in L.A. He does remember not liking<br/>\nour current park day as much when we first came, and since he had that<br/>\nexperience, he&#39;s willing to keep coming back to the new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 7/31/06 5:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for play groups..park days esp mixed-traditional  styles...

Sorry I don&#39;t have much advice to offer but I have a question, why does he want to go to school? Is it only for socialization? You&#39;re right that you can&#39;t force him to love homeschooling. I love homeschooling and my son thought about going to school this fall until he visited a school for the day. During that time I was very stressed because the thought of school appaulled me. However, I did feel that he needed to make his own choice. I guess I would try to get more information as to why he feels homeschooling isn&#39;t working for him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Deanna<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nwannabeinfiji &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lesnack@...\">lesnack@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hi!
