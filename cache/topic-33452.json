He knows very much he&#39;s unschooling <br/>\nand somehow decided that means he makes all his own choices. We did <br/>\nhave rules before on bedtimes because his school started at 8am. <br/>\nOccasionally we would allow him to stay up late for parties or during <br/>\nthe summer time but not much during the year as it would mess up his <br/>\nsleep schedule for school. So he&#39;s tested his personal limits before. <br/>\nBut before he was usually the kind of kid that would ask to go to bed <br/>\nor fall asleep during the fireworks on the 4th of July. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe stopped the mandatory bedtimes almost a year ago. He had some fun <br/>\nstaying up but has always been such a good sleeper and would choose <br/>\nto go to bed on his own. This current situation has been off and on <br/>\nfor a couple of months (since sometime in January). It&#39;s &quot;on&quot; <br/>\nwhenever I don&#39;t intervene. But when I do intervene, it causes so <br/>\nmuch stress between the two of us, so I think maybe I&#39;m not handling <br/>\nit very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what the deal is. He did say something the other day <br/>\nalong the lines of &quot;Unschooled kids don&#39;t have a bedtime.&quot; So maybe <br/>\nhe feels like he needs to stay up and push himself past what he <br/>\nnormally would...to be cool maybe? To differentiate between himself <br/>\nand others who go to bed earlier or go to school? I&#39;m not sure on <br/>\nthis one. But it would make sense as to why he doesn&#39;t seem to see <br/>\nhis exhaustion. Maybe he&#39;s refusing to see it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest problem is when I do intervene, he gets really upset. <br/>\nThat&#39;s when he says I&#39;m treating him like a child, or he&#39;ll say I&#39;m <br/>\nnot &#39;giving him any respect&#39; or allowing him to make his own choices. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not as if I&#39;m going Clock-Nazi on him and demanding he be in bed <br/>\nat 8pm on the dot. I think at least, I&#39;m handling it nicely, <br/>\nexplaining what I see and explaining how its affecting others and <br/>\nthat that is why I&#39;m intervening. But he normally interjects with &quot;I <br/>\nwon&#39;t stay up as late, I&#39;ll be in a better mood tomorrow&quot; etc and <br/>\nthen when I stick to a bedtime, he says I don&#39;t trust him. And then <br/>\nI&#39;m feeling stuck, unsure of how to explain it to him as not being <br/>\nabout trust but being about facts. And if I don&#39;t explain it to him <br/>\nhe gets very upset. He likes to know exactly what is happening, and <br/>\nwhy so not explaining things to him is interpretted like &#39;cuz I said <br/>\nso&#39; and doesn&#39;t carry very far over here. But explaining it just gets <br/>\nmore arguments!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mentioned  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>feel  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he  <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not depression/pessimism.

Another thought is when I am in an overwhelmed state (that has lasted days, weeks, or months) I also pick 10p as a bedtime for myself because I know that after that I get REALLY overwhelmed.  Often at 10 I don&#39;t FEEL like going to bed, but I know that it is best for me during these times.  It may just be something he has to do (for himself), for the long-term affect.  Maybe you can encourage him to help him understand that need that his body has (1/2 of us that live here have that need - to go to bed early or suffer with anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, the other 1/2 can stay up all night long and be kind and sweet and not suffer for it -- everyone is made different).  Sandra had a lot of good points too.  Kids often don&#39;t listen to their bodies or don&#39;t know what they are listening for -- you can help him see things like &quot;when you cry easily, it means you&#39;re tired&quot; or &quot;when you don&#39;t enjoy being around people it means you need to go to bed a<br/>\n little earlier&quot; -- not as a punishment obviously, but just as that&#39;s what his body may need.   It may be a fun time to learn more about brain chemicals and function with him if he wants.

Another sign of clinical depression is insomnia -- could this be what he is struggling with?  When this happens to me I feel like I can neither go to sleep or wake up -- it&#39;s a weird, very debilitating, state to be in - and it&#39;s a vicious cycle because nothing is enjoyable because you don&#39;t have the energy to enjoy or do it, and that affects the mind and outlook and anxiety levels.  I would say right now his body chemistry is way out of wack and listening to his body right now would be counter productive.  I agree with Sandra in getting him out of the house, change of scenery, distractions, etc.  When I get to this state also it&#39;s when I KNOW that I need to make some serious diet changes, get some vitamins, or if all else fails, go to the doc for help.   Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve looked into before but never tried for our daughter as she somehow got better with age, but she was<br/>\n never so low that she said she wished she were dead -- that is serious.

Since we&#39;ve been unschooling (over a year) he usually goes to bed when I go to bed (around 10) and wakes up around 9a. <br/>\n<br/>\nLately though he&#39;s been testing his own limits, staying up as late as possible (after 4am) and sleeping in. At first I was cool with this, even happy that he was trying to listen to his body and learn his bodies limits now rather than later. Except that hasn&#39;t been happening. When he stays up late, he doesn&#39;t sleep in long enough to make up the difference. I&#39;ve tried keeping the shades drawn, the house quiet etc but it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. I&#39;ve also tried suggesting he do something more relaxing when he first wakes up but that doesn&#39;t usually happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep it&#39;s as if the world is falling down around him. It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is mentioned in the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things feel (like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or the dogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he can&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). It&#39;s just a mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve tried several things....at first I tried waiting it out, expecting him to see how the lack of sleep was making him feel. Then I tried discussing what I see, how sleep deprivation affects the body, the common signs and signals of needing more sleep. I&#39;ve even tried not hiding my frustration in hopes of showing him how it affects the rest of the household. No luck. He insists he&#39;s not tired, that he&#39;s getting enough sleep, etc. The other thing is when he has gone several days like this, he gets louder. Then he&#39;s bothering DH who goes to bed at 8p and gets up at 3:30am. (However, the noise level is only occasionally an issue; usually the issue is his mood/demeanor the next day.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we were able to have an open talk about it and he mentioned that he thought 10p was a good time for him to go to bed and said if we both went to bed and read, then he&#39;d be happy with that. But when it came time to do so, the answer was &quot;I don&#39;t want to; I want to watch/play this.&quot; in which case I&#39;m stuck. Thursday night he picked a bedtime (to be able to wake early enough to do charity work he wanted to do with his Gramma Friday morning) and I needed to remind him of it repeatedly. Last night he also needed to go to bed early to be able to wake in time to do something with his other Grandma today. However last night he used these as examples of how I&#39;m &quot;treating him like a child&quot; by making him go to bed before he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause he gets hyper or sensitive with lack of sleep instead of tired, he says &quot;I don&#39;t feel tired.&quot; With him not interpreting his bodies signals well, I&#39;m wondering how much more reasoning I can do with him. I do not like taking control of this issue but it&#39;s so badly affecting the harmony in the house, that I&#39;m ready to draw the line. DH and I are frustrated with dealing with a crabby child and getting our head bitten off all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny words of wisdom on how to work this out and bring our household back in harmony? If I should step back, how should I deal with his affected mood? And if I should draw the line, how exactly do I do that in a peaceful way that doesn&#39;t make me look like a controlling parent?

Sleep is a big part of health  <br/>\nand peace and people in the family need to get, must get, enough  <br/>\nsleep.  &quot;Enough&quot; varies, but &quot;not enough&quot; tends to show.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Thursday night he picked a bedtime (to be able to wake early  <br/>\nenough to do charity work he wanted to do with his Gramma Friday  <br/>\nmorning) and I needed to remind him of it repeatedly. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would&#39;ve helped set his bed up, made sure others in the family were  <br/>\nprepared to take their noise elsewhere, and helped him be ready for  <br/>\nbed earlier than the stated time,  help him set his alarm, tell him  <br/>\nquietly that it&#39;s only seven or eight hours until then, and set him  <br/>\nup to read or listen to music or whatever helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-However last night he used these as examples of how I&#39;m &quot;treating  <br/>\nhim like a child&quot; by making him go to bed before he wants to.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how is he treating you and his dad?  Like a noisy burglar  <br/>\nsometimes and like an invading grump sometimes?   Like a deal- <br/>\nbreaking nuisance?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s too young to be quiet when others are asleep and too young to  <br/>\narrange to get enough sleep, then he&#39;s too young to make decisions  <br/>\nabout when to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing maybe you had rules before you were unschooling, and  <br/>\nhe&#39;s seeing what it feels like to not-follow the rules. I think he&#39;s  <br/>\nprobably living in a reactionary mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said lately this, and you&#39;ve tried that, but how long are you  <br/>\ntalking--weeks?  months?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is mentioned  <br/>\nin the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things feel  <br/>\n(like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or the  <br/>\ndogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he  <br/>\ncan&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot depression/pessimism.  Affecting his mood.  Affecting his emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPressure and shame won&#39;t help.  Let us know more and maybe we can  <br/>\nhelp you with some ways to disengage in some ways that might help.   <br/>\nBut in the meantime, if it were me, I would say that the staying up  <br/>\nlate is wholly contingent on his  being quiet and kind and sweet and  <br/>\npeaceful, day and night.  And if he&#39;s staying up past the time he&#39;s  <br/>\nreally sleepy, then he&#39;s not keeping his deal either.   On the other  <br/>\nhand, if he&#39;s been told when to go to bed for all the years up to  <br/>\nnow, he might not know what sleepy&#39;s really like.   If it&#39;s only been  <br/>\ndays or weeks, that might be the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232521827,"authorName":"organicsis","from":"organicsis &lt;organicsis@...&gt;","profile":"organicsis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Here we go again (sleep Q)","postDate":"1206201581","msgId":33452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2NDAyNi45OTU3NC5xbUB3ZWI1MTMwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33454,"prevInTime":33451,"nextInTime":33453,"topicId":33452,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Z (8) has always been a fairly regular sleeper, averaging 11 hours a night for several years. Since we ve been unschooling (over a year) he usually goes to bed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2115208877\">Z (8) has always been a fairly regular sleeper, averaging 11 hours a night for several years. Since we&#39;ve been unschooling (over a year) he usually goes to bed when I go to bed (around 10) and wakes up around 9a. <br/>\n <br/>\nLately though he&#39;s been testing his own limits, staying up as late as possible (after 4am) and sleeping in. At first I was cool with this, even happy that he was trying to listen to his body and learn his bodies limits now rather than later. Except that hasn&#39;t been happening. When he stays up late, he doesn&#39;t sleep in long enough to make up the difference. I&#39;ve tried keeping the shades drawn, the house quiet etc but it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. I&#39;ve also tried suggesting he do something more relaxing when he first wakes up but that doesn&#39;t usually happen. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep it&#39;s as if the world is falling down around him. It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is mentioned in the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things feel (like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or the dogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he can&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). It&#39;s just a mess.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I&#39;ve tried several things....at first I tried waiting it out, expecting him to see how the lack of sleep was making him feel. Then I tried discussing what I see, how sleep deprivation affects the body, the common signs and signals of needing more sleep. I&#39;ve even tried not hiding my frustration in hopes of showing him how it affects the rest of the household. No luck. He insists he&#39;s not tired, that he&#39;s getting enough sleep, etc. The other thing is when he has gone several days like this, he gets louder. Then he&#39;s bothering DH who goes to bed at 8p and gets up at 3:30am. (However, the noise level is only occasionally an issue; usually the issue is his mood/demeanor the next day.) <br/>\n <br/>\nOnce we were able to have an open talk about it and he mentioned that he thought 10p was a good time for him to go to bed and said if we both went to bed and read, then he&#39;d be happy with that. But when it came time to do so, the answer was &quot;I don&#39;t want to; I want to watch/play this.&quot; in which case I&#39;m stuck. Thursday night he picked a bedtime (to be able to wake early enough to do charity work he wanted to do with his Gramma Friday morning) and I needed to remind him of it repeatedly. Last night he also needed to go to bed early to be able to wake in time to do something with his other Grandma today. However last night he used these as examples of how I&#39;m &quot;treating him like a child&quot; by making him go to bed before he wants to.<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause he gets hyper or sensitive with lack of sleep instead of tired, he says &quot;I don&#39;t feel tired.&quot; With him not interpreting his bodies signals well, I&#39;m wondering how much more reasoning I can do with him. I do not like taking control of this issue but it&#39;s so badly affecting the harmony in the house, that I&#39;m ready to draw the line. DH and I are frustrated with dealing with a crabby child and getting our head bitten off all day. <br/>\n <br/>\nAny words of wisdom on how to work this out and bring our household back in harmony? If I should step back, how should I deal with his affected mood? And if I should draw the line, how exactly do I do that in a peaceful way that doesn&#39;t make me look like a controlling parent? Is there another option I&#39;m not seeing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for advice in this very sticky situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nTara<br/>\nOur Unschooling Blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://heartschooling.blogspot.com\">http://heartschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nWorried about the environment?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com\">http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\nWorried about the economy?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  <br/>\nFind them fast with Yahoo!
