That could be a way for him to &quot;be involved in her <br/>\neducation&quot; and feel good about his contribution to her life. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe &#39;feel good about his contribution to her life&#39; (as I discovered when really <br/>\ntrying to hear is concerns) is a major factor for him. Basically his desire to <br/>\n&#39;seek legal advice&#39; was so he knew where his rights stood as a parent so he <br/>\ncould ensure what he believed to be the best thing for P was done and if he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do this then &quot;What am I here for?&quot;, was/is his question. Unfortunately <br/>\nthere has been many a time that I have had to help him see his importance to her <br/>\nand the most basic thing is just because he is her dad, you can&#39;t get more <br/>\nimportant! I think I will just have to keep updating him of little things that <br/>\nshe says and does that are related to him so he knows it isn&#39;t just the <br/>\nweekend/dinner contact that she is &#39;with him&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n---Sandra--- Wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There is a slight possibility (slight) that he has considered that if you <br/>\nunschool her she will be way too happy at your house and he can&#39;t compete. Or <br/>\nthat if you teach her, that she will resist seeing you and he will get to have <br/>\nher more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat guess is pessimistic and suspicious, and I hope I&#39;m just wrong, but it <br/>\nmight be worth gently pointing that out to him to see whether he had considered <br/>\nthose things.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately this isn&#39;t a slight possibility on his part. For myself though, I <br/>\nhave never considered this to even be a factor with P given our relationship and <br/>\nalso having done lessons etc... (prior to finding unschooling) where it did not <br/>\nimpact on her choice of homes to live in. At the end of the day though, if <br/>\nlessons were my conviction and this made her want to spend more time at her <br/>\nfathers, that would be her choice (and his).<br/>\n <br/>\nThis also isn&#39;t something that has just come up with unschooling though. We have <br/>\nmany animals and with each addition I would see him feel and think &#39;how am I <br/>\ngoing to compete&#39;. It was never an issue though and she has never not wanted to <br/>\ngo and see him because of having the animals. I will have to remind him of past <br/>\nrealities. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is though something that has come up for him to be &#39;about&#39; unschooling as now <br/>\nthat we are striving toward consensual living P has a DS, an XBox and also loves <br/>\non line and PC games. This would be a good time to note that previously I <br/>\nwas the anti-technology dictator and fearer! (A great big thank you =) to <br/>\nsomeone who posted about &#39;Zoo Tycoon&#39; many months ago, P loves it and we now <br/>\nhave it on the PC and DS!). Her desired subject matter is currently anything <br/>\ngaming. =) I suppose though that it is the &#39;unrestricted&#39; use of these things <br/>\nand knowing that she has choices in our house that has possibly overwhelmed him <br/>\nand compounded his fear of her not wanting to see him. Again I will have to make <br/>\nmention that the contrary is our and his actual reality. Only once she did <br/>\nnot want to go and I realised it was because she had a new game, so now I make a <br/>\nmental note not to give her a new game within 2 days of her weekend with him. =) <br/>\n This for me is part of my effort to extend consensual living outwardly to my <br/>\nparter, ex-husband and others in my life, hopefully strangers too. I have found <br/>\nit much easier to do this with the girls and have had difficulty getting past my <br/>\nown ego to be able to be like this with my partner. =)  Trying to be mindful on <br/>\na daily basis helps a lot, so does &#39;think before you speak!&#39;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;As someone else pointed out, if she knows that it&#39;s because of him that you&#39;re <br/>\n&quot;making her&quot; do &quot;schoolwork,&quot; she will be mad at BOTH of you, only you will have <br/>\ndone all the work to harden her poor young heart.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nM and I have the advantage of knowing eachother for 17  years now, since we were <br/>\nteenagers. We were very close friends for many of those years before being <br/>\nmarried later down the track. I feel that this is what helps us do the right <br/>\nthing by eachother and for P. Even though we have both changed as people and do <br/>\nnot interact as close friends any longer, there is still that feeling of <br/>\ncloseness. This helps to prevent either of us from doing extra harm to P in <br/>\nthose ways and also being mindful and putting our egos aside. We set up rules <br/>\ntogether, no negative talk in front of her in any situation and if need be, we <br/>\nmeet alone to discuss. This is aslo implemented at home without the other parent <br/>\naround, &#39;gossip&#39; and conversations that involve the other parent are not had in <br/>\nfront of the girls.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are some days that she as most children with separated parents makes <br/>\ncomment about prefering the other parent. I either gently explain that her <br/>\nfathers days with her are specifically set aside for her alone and the reality <br/>\nwould be very similar as in our own home with him having to work and juggle time <br/>\netc... Otherwise I am grateful for the benefits of her being able to have his <br/>\nundivided attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you everyone for the blogging information and links.
