I need some big nudges to achieve certain <br/>\ngoals. Some of my goals include some not very comfortable momenst and I tend <br/>\nto avoid the discomfort (training for a triathlon). I want dh to bug me and I <br/>\nwant him to be there working out with me too.....sometimes maybe that&#39;s what <br/>\nour kids need, a friendly partner.<br/>\nI hated practicing piano as a kid. I think I would have just sat and messed <br/>\nwith it more had my Mom been willing to sit with me....I really  just didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike doing it alone.<br/>\nI know a LOT of people that will  work out with a partner but just can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto self motivate, and yet being in shape is something they really want.<br/>\nI would not have rolled my sorry A** out of bed at 6:30 this morning to go <br/>\nswim in the gulf and then bike 18 miles. But when dh woke me up and said &quot;are <br/>\nyou coming?&quot; it was suddenly doable.<br/>\nI think kids are no different. They have things they want that are difficult <br/>\nto achieve. They may ask for a nudge, or they may just want a partner in the <br/>\nventure. I think being an aware parent helps us know the signals they are <br/>\nsending and gives us a chance to dialogue with them to help understand what <br/>\nour role is in helping them achieve that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8847,"nextTopicId":8798}}
