First from the office <br/>\n&gt; asking why I allowed both my girls to stay home yesterday and spend <br/>\n&gt; the day with me. I informed them that with my work sec. it was the <br/>\n&gt; only time I had to see them, and entire family took days off work <br/>\n&gt; ext. write them down excused parent or sick  (call it mommy iddess, <br/>\n&gt; witch ever I didn&#39;t care)<br/>\n&gt;  Then the next was from my Daughter in tears again. We had gotten <br/>\n&gt; her hair cut yesterday and the girls where making fun of her writing <br/>\n&gt; on the bathroom walls and so forth. Even threatened to kill her again <br/>\n&gt; and beat her up, for getting her hair cut.<br/>\n&gt; I had had it. Daughter wanted to come home I told them release her <br/>\n&gt; they said just because she is being picked on .I told them for get it <br/>\n&gt; I will be right there. I met daughter in hall and said you sure you <br/>\n&gt; want to do this now she said please mom. We marched into the <br/>\n&gt; superintendent&#39;s office asked for the paper work was asked why and I <br/>\n&gt; re told them why. They gave me the paper work and we went to the <br/>\n&gt; locker and cleaned it out. Turned in the books and said we are done.<br/>\n&gt;   So now here is my dilemma on the paper work it says I have to <br/>\n&gt; have special permission it reads:<br/>\n&gt; No. #8. If the child is currently identified as a child requiring in <br/>\n&gt; special education prior approval must be sought from the special <br/>\n&gt; education director at the Area Education Agency if this is the first <br/>\n&gt; year that the child will be receiving Competent Privet instruction in <br/>\n&gt; Iowa. Iowa code section 200A.9<br/>\n&gt;  If she had a IEP is she one that needs special permission?<br/>\n&gt; I told her she didn&#39;t have to go back. And I will not lie to her. <br/>\n&gt; Next Monday is nest day during the day I have off and will make a <br/>\n&gt; trip to the homeschool in Kolona and see if I can transfer her there, <br/>\n&gt; and bypass it all. But thought I would inform here to progress. And <br/>\n&gt; ask for advice.<br/>\n&gt; Dee<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dee, you wonderful, loving Mom!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe probably IS considered to need special permission. What kind of <br/>\nrelationship do you have with the SPED people? Maybe it won&#39;t be a big deal. <br/>\nIf it seems to be, I&#39;d consider going right to the Superintendent. It&#39;s so <br/>\nclose to the end of the school year it might not even be a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep us posted, and let us know if you need help.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13968,"nextTopicId":13977}}
