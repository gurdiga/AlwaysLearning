On one of the local lists I belong to, there&#39;s no controversy allowed! As soon as anyone mentions an iffy topic (last one was vaccination) the list owner demands silence!!. before a discussion even starts.....boring.......<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really enjoying this list. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced my self yet. I&#39;m Kerrin, I live in New Zealand. My 5 unschooled kids are blossoming after nearly 3 years out of school. I have taken all that time to deschool myself and I&#39;m now feeling confident, most of the time. I&#39;ve almost jumped into a couple of discussions, but been too busy. Any time now I&#39;ll reach the point where I can&#39;t help myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   I got kicked off a list!!.................. <br/>\n  I was too radical and they decided to quickly silence me.<br/>\n  sigh....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n  Version: 6.0.445 / Virus Database: 250 - Release Date: 21/01/03<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11834,"nextTopicId":11823}}
