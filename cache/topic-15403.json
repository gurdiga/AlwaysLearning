The airport is the very worst part<br/>\nof town, and I never went out that way except to go to the airport.  I lived<br/>\nin the south hills area, completely on the other side of town.  We were<br/>\nabout 3 blocks above the smog line when it was so awful in town during the<br/>\ninversions in winter.  I&#39;d look out the door in the morning and Missoula<br/>\nwould be completely gone.  It was so pretty that way....&lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry you&#39;re missing Montana.  We&#39;ll remember you to Glacier park when we<br/>\n&gt; get there.  I can send you a Missoulian or an Independent if you want.<br/>\n&gt; Or, maybe a nice bottle of wine from Lolo Peak Winery?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remember me to Two Medicine Camp store if you&#39;re out that way.  That&#39;s where<br/>\nI worked, back in the days when employees (all 6 of us) lived on site rather<br/>\nthan drive in.  It was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll just come visit you and all my favorite haunts sometime!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15386,"nextTopicId":15388}}
