(I&#39;ll actually watch anything<br/>\nSean Penn touches.)  The movie website and it&#39;s accompanying music<br/>\nalone put me in an emotional/reflective state.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to comment that I think almost all movies can be used<br/>\nalong the lines of self-improvement.  I personally get very wrapped up<br/>\nin the emotions of just about any movie and find myself reflecting on<br/>\nmy own thoughts and feelings that surface from almost every single one<br/>\nI watch.  It&#39;s cathartic for the mind and soul, especially the ones<br/>\nthat bring tears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere along my own self-improvement journey that we don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to necessarily re-live our past painful experiences to move past<br/>\nthem; we simply need to experience the attached emotion and move<br/>\nthrough it.  Getting caught up in the emotions of a movie is one way I<br/>\nhave found that helps to easily access those emotions (especially the<br/>\nemotions we stifle) without getting caught up in all the details of<br/>\nour hurts, experience these emotions, and then let them go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have many examples, but the 2 that stick out in my mind the most<br/>\nwere when I got divorced in my 20s and after my grandfather passed<br/>\naway.  I am the stiff-upper lip kind of person, always put on a front<br/>\nof strength in front of others, so perhaps that&#39;s why movies are my<br/>\nbest form of therapy - I can express emotion and move on without<br/>\nreally having to go into the painful details that caused the emotion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing my separation from my ex-husband, I watched a movie (can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the name) that wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sad, but my emotions<br/>\nwere just under the surface and easily accessible.  I was home alone<br/>\nin my empty house, the movie brought the emotions up, and I bawled my<br/>\neyes out for I don&#39;t know how long.  Then I was done, and I was able<br/>\nto move forward with my life with hardly a tear afterwards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when my grandfather passed away a few years ago, I went back<br/>\nto my hometown and spent the week catering to my mother (her father),<br/>\nagain being &quot;the strong one&quot;.  Upon returning to my own home, I<br/>\nwatched Ladder 49 (without realizing the potential implications). <br/>\nWell, that&#39;s a really sad movie to begin with, and again I bawled. <br/>\nAnd, once again, my grief moved through me, and I was done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for self-improvement with regards to healing our past childhood<br/>\nhurts, I think I&#39;ve had the same experiences with movies though I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember specifics, probably because I didn&#39;t realize it at the<br/>\ntime, but I know there are mother/daughter movies that have brought me<br/>\ntears.  Through self-improvement, I have healed a lot of old hurts<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve held from issues with my mom, and I think movies have helped<br/>\nin this regard.  Makes me want to go find some more, and I&#39;ll<br/>\ndefinitely be watching &quot;Into the Wild&quot; now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199360242,"authorName":"graberamy","from":"&quot;graberamy&quot; &lt;graber@...&gt;","profile":"graberamy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"into the wild","postDate":"1205165063","msgId":32901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyM202NytzdHZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32935,"prevInTime":32900,"nextInTime":32902,"topicId":32901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This kinda goes along w/ self improvement...

Usually watching a movie I imagine myself as the<br/>\nmain character but in watching this movie I was imagining the main<br/>\ncharacter as one of my kids, watching it from a parent perspective.  I&#39;m<br/>\nrecommending it here because the movie is about the true life journey<br/>\nfor this young man, one I think started as a journey to escape his<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH and I both have strained relationships with our parents (he more than<br/>\nI, much more), I&#39;ll just sum it up as we both tended to do just the<br/>\nopposite of what any one of them would say.  And we both took journeys<br/>\nto escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t arrive at unschooling through any certain path (attachment<br/>\nparenting, la leche league, and some of the other paths that seem fairly<br/>\nlogical).  It happened for us through trial and error. I&#39;ve made my<br/>\nshare of mistakes, unfortunately, and unfortunately still do, but I&#39;m<br/>\ndetermined to be a better parent so my kids can just be (be themselves,<br/>\nbe happy, be independent).  Unschooling came into our lives because it<br/>\nis a perfect fit.    I don&#39;t know how else you can raise independent,<br/>\nhappy kids w/out them being able to make informed choices about their<br/>\nown lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking back I may have started homeschooling for educational purposes,<br/>\nthinking my kids would get the best education at home. Then I thought<br/>\nthe best way to educate them was by unschooling them and giving them<br/>\nmore freedom.  Now, it&#39;s no longer about their education (per say), it&#39;s<br/>\nabout their happiness and how they feel about themselves and  how they<br/>\nsee themselves.   Learning w/ meaning for them, not necessarily meaning<br/>\nfor me (acceptance on my part).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted to recommend that movie here.  It touched me and made<br/>\nme want to be a better parent.  Life is short, too short for some.  Our<br/>\ntime being our children&#39;s parents is short, we don&#39;t have time for<br/>\nmistakes.   Unschooling  has been one of the best choices I&#39;ve made for<br/>\nmy kids and learning about unschooling and becoming an unschooler has<br/>\nbeen a great journey for me and my self improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and personally, running is my mental savior.
