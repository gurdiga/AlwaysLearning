(Not to mention the custody issues and money issues that arise when being a single parent or a jobless parent...)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I wanted to comment on this question:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;With a kid that&#39;s stepped over the line from<br/>\n&gt; &quot;at risk&quot; to &quot;in Juvie&quot;, do you think it&#39;d be OK to support/encourage<br/>\n&gt; unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had a boyfriend in high school and through some of college who was labled a &#39;troubled&#39; kid.  He was very smart and creative, but not in ways that worked well in school.  (Not compliant by any means, and often bored in classes because they were not challenging for him.)  He ended up being the school drug dealer, often skipped classes, often was in trouble, and was kicked out at 17 when he was a junior.  Getting kicked out was probably the BEST thing that ever happened for him--the following year he got his GED at a local community college that had a music recording program he was interested in.  He got his associate&#39;s there and went on to one of the biggest music recording schools in the US, graduated, and now works in Hollywood as a pretty successful sound effects recorder.  He&#39;s worked on all of the Saw movies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, had he had the opportunity to be unschooled at some point during high school (or before), he would have THRIVED.  Having the opportunity to follow his passions with the support of caring adults (instead of the constant criticism he recieved in school and at home), I think, would have only improved his life.  Being stuck in school felt, to him, like a big waste of his time.  This would have all depended on his parents&#39; ability to really understand unschooling and want to love/support him unconditionally, etc., which didn&#39;t seem like something they were able/wanting to do at that time (at least from my POV).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share this, not sure if it pertains to J, but I think that a child labled &#39;at risk&#39; such as J might really benefit by (for lack of a better description) really *good* unschooling.  This all would depend on his dad&#39;s ability to &#39;get&#39; unschooling and apply/utilize it in their lives, esp. w/ all the turmoil involving the mom, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Torn about advice/support","postDate":"1243629355","msgId":45606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2cGd2YitvN3NiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDkwNTI5MDkwNmg2YzMzNDczYnNiMGNkNmFiZDJkMDJlNDk2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45605,"nextInTopic":45609,"prevInTime":45605,"nextInTime":45607,"topicId":45601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It could result in years of power<br/>\nstruggles between father and mother.  Narcissists really do believe they<br/>\nare right and everyone else is wrong and will do whatever it takes to<br/>\nprove it and maintain control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it results in years of power stuggles, the focus will NOT be on<br/>\nthe child in the right way.  It may be better for the dad to quite his<br/>\njob, do a stay at home kind of job and spend loads of time with his<br/>\nchild loving him up and giving him attention.  And maybe mom will become<br/>\ncompletely dissatisfied with this arrangement and leave again.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids in these situations really do see things, they can see who&#39;s<br/>\ncausing the Sh** to happen.  The more dad does to empower himself and<br/>\nhis son and create safety for each of them, the better off both of them<br/>\nwill be, wether mom stays or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the kid is out of juvie, dad should get him home and create comfort<br/>\nand kindness for him.

I&#39;ve known<br/>\nJ since he was tiny, and he is a brilliant, sensitive, imaginative,<br/>\nreally really interesting kid. And at this moment in time, he&#39;s in<br/>\nJuvenile Hall.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend is married to J&#39;s mother, who is... well, she&#39;s a piece of<br/>\nwork. About 6 years ago, she decided she needed to find herself,<br/>\nditched S and J, and moved across the country for a year. When she<br/>\ncame back (because S felt it was important to stay married to his<br/>\nson&#39;s mother), she &quot;reclaimed&quot; the spectacularly gorgeous game room S<br/>\nput together for J, as her &quot;sewing room&quot;. I mean, painted over murals,<br/>\nripped up carpet, the works. Totally self-absorbed and bombastic<br/>\nwoman.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore J landed in Juvie, S was going to bring him up here for a visit<br/>\nwith my husband (whom J adores) and I, to talk about his future. S and<br/>\nI talk a lot, and he knows my opinion of formal education, public<br/>\nschool in the area we live in, and that I think that especially for<br/>\nkids whose inner life is as important as their outer, having more time<br/>\nand space to really think things through might be really good for J.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend is ready to dump his job, and stay home and be with J. He<br/>\nfeels that he let his mother run the parenting and she&#39;s done an<br/>\nabysmal job of being there for J and supporting J, and he&#39;s decided to<br/>\ntake over. This will almost certainly end up in divorce.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my question. With a kid that&#39;s stepped over the line from<br/>\n&quot;at risk&quot; to &quot;in Juvie&quot;, do you think it&#39;d be OK to support/encourage<br/>\nunschooling? I know that &quot;married&quot; carries a lot of weight, but in<br/>\nthis situation, that&#39;s not contributing substantively to J&#39;s<br/>\ndevelopment or environment. Divorce would get him the support he needs<br/>\nfrom his dad, but trust is already shot to pieces, and I have no idea<br/>\nif it&#39;d be possible to get it back in time. Course, some trust would<br/>\nbe better than none (which is where it seems to be now).<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep thinking myself into circles.
