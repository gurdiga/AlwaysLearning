The quote (put in public, on <br/>\n  someone else&#39;s blog) is this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-She&#39;s been a bully and disrespectful in the face of a humbled <br/>\n  apology from someone wanting to listen and dialog, not once, not <br/>\n  twice, but three times over twice that many years. It is sad for the <br/>\n  very reasons you listed here: she does challenge thinking, gets <br/>\n  questions going...I found it all very valuable until I experienced <br/>\n  where the threshold of consistency ended: she&#39;s the boss, the <br/>\n  authority, the one runnin&#39; the show. Not so mindful. It does however, <br/>\n  free one to discard an ill fitting label, knowing I would no longer <br/>\n  like to associate with it anyway.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  First, I have questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Was it the same person three times in six years who came, caused a <br/>\n  problem, &quot;humbly&quot; apologized and then was &quot;bullied&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can someone staying on her own site and her own list who is <br/>\n  badmouthed there, and on a couple of blogs, be considered to be the <br/>\n  one doing the bullying?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And I have comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A private apology for a public insult is never sufficient. To be <br/>\n  fair, I wasn&#39;t allowing the &quot;apology&quot; onto the list because it was <br/>\n  wrapped in insult and kinda dripping with venom and defensiveness. <br/>\n  It didn&#39;t feel like an apology. It felt like someone begging me to <br/>\n  let her back in please-please-please so she could be mean to me again <br/>\n  once there was an audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n  People who say &quot;I would unschool, but I don&#39;t like Sandra&quot; (or <br/>\n  whatever else flimsy excuse they make) just didn&#39;t want to unschool <br/>\n  in the first place, but wants to blame it on someone or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some people do better if they feel they have dangerous enemies. Some <br/>\n  people want to tag me to be their dangerous enemy. I have no <br/>\n  interest in being anyone&#39;s dangerous or dramatic nemesis. I don&#39;t <br/>\n  have a nemesis nor do I want one. I hand out with my kids a lot and <br/>\n  I write to other unschoolers. People who aren&#39;t unschoolers <br/>\n  sometimes try to stop me. People who want me to say that anything in <br/>\n  the whole world is unschooling if someone utters the magic word <br/>\n  &quot;unschooing&quot; before requiring French lessons or Saxon math. I won&#39;t <br/>\n  do that. So they try bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone from Australia once wrote that they have the concept there of <br/>\n  &quot;tall poppy syndrome.&quot; If someone is prominent, others try to chop <br/>\n  them down.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My prominence is from consistency and longevity. I&#39;m still here. <br/>\n  If I were chopped down and weren&#39;t here, someone could claim they <br/>\n  chopped me down.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone chopped down the World Trade Center, and gets to say &quot;I did <br/>\n  that!&quot; (Or his cronies get to say it, and they like to think he&#39;s <br/>\n  being congratulated in Paradise where he&#39;s sitting at the head table <br/>\n  being backslapped and saluted, maybe.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone paints on a wall and sees that graffiti or vandalism and says <br/>\n  &quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone posts something hateful on a blog comment and says &quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Meanwhile, what are her kids doing? Has she helped anyone, or <br/>\n  herself, or her kids? Has she hurt me?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I see comments like these, and I think &quot;I helped with that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/list\">http://sandradodd.com/list</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/change\">http://sandradodd.com/change</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/feedback\">http://sandradodd.com/feedback</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  They stopped bullying their kids and they feel better about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t go to anyone else&#39;s house to see what they&#39;re doing.
