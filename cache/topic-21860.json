I really do already get the unschooling philosophy.  I<br/>\nwant to read a book called something about De-schooling ourselves.  I really<br/>\nneed that because that is the biggest hinderance.  My son is always doing<br/>\nthings that are math as part of the natural world.  Like for instance, at<br/>\nthis very moment he is rolling pennies and telling me how much he has in<br/>\ndollar amounts - and hundreds - all on his own.  Left to do things like that<br/>\nhe seems to learn more than he can on paper from a workbook.  I have always<br/>\nseen that and yet my own fear has kept me from letting it just happen that<br/>\nway. <br/>\nThe unschooling book that helped me was the Unschooling Handbook  - It was a<br/>\nhuge encouragement.  It basically gave me the courage to let go of what I<br/>\nwas trying to do and the frustration that they weren&#39;t absorbing the facts<br/>\nthat I was trying to shove in anyway.  They really truly only learn what<br/>\nthey are bent towards and interested in.  The rest seems to be fact spewing.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso as far as teaching the 7 year old to be a good reader - he basically<br/>\nalready reads just not strong - yesterday he let me know he wanted to<br/>\npractice reading because he wants to know what his sisters spell to try to<br/>\nhide things from him.  So evidently this will be a covert operation between<br/>\nthe two of us.  Ah that mother and child bonding!!!!! :)<br/>\nThanks again - I really appreciate the time you took to write me and the<br/>\nlinks to others maybe more in the same place as me.<br/>\nSincerely - Julie<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-------Original Message-------<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\nDate: 3/11/2005 10:31:00 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to Unschooling<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=--Hi - My name is Julie and I have three children.

I would rather have a child that loves<br/>\nmath and reading than a child who learned early, but who hates reading and<br/>\nmath.

Just brag about the things your<br/>\nchildren do on their own.  Do they play on the computer?  Make web pages?<br/>\nDo computer art? (paint program)  It might take awhile, but your children<br/>\nwill start to crave knowledge and it might not be from a text book.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;for fear of <br/>\n&gt;ridicule. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learn learn learn.

I am <br/>\nburned out.  I am also a Christian - and as I was praying about how <br/>\nto cope, I had a book jump out at me in the library on unschooling.  <br/>\nI finished it that night - which is a record for me - and started <br/>\nsearching for more.  I had a friend hand me some John Holt books <br/>\nthat I haven&#39;t read yet, but I need some information from the <br/>\npopulation.  First of all generally speaking - where is everybody <br/>\nfrom?  Secondly, what was the biggest motivation to &quot;unschooling&quot;?  <br/>\nThird, what would be the best piece of advice you could give a new <br/>\nunschooler?  I have three children - 7, 11 and 14.  This is all <br/>\npretty new to me and to be honest I am concerned that my 7 year old <br/>\nwill not read or get basic math facts down - as well as that my 11 <br/>\nyear old that hates math won&#39;t ever be able to comfortably do basic <br/>\nmath - or learn to love to read.  <br/>\nI would just like to talk to some of you.  I feel a bit like there <br/>\nis a stigma attached to unschooling - and am somewhat afraid to let <br/>\npeople know what my husband and I have decided to do for fear of <br/>\nridicule.  There is only one other unschooling family I know.  I <br/>\nthink people tend to think it has something to do with laziness.  <br/>\nJust the few days we have spent chasing any rabbit trail of the kids <br/>\nchoosing, I know you cannot be lazy and truly un-school.  <br/>\nThanks for letting me throw my questions out there!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21854,"nextTopicId":21877}}
