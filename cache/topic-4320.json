My karate students just passed their belt<br/>\ntests (yea!) and my instructor, who tests them, asked to see grades next<br/>\ntime.  This is standard in his testing procedure.  Most of the kids are<br/>\nschool-at-homers so it isn&#39;t a problem for them.  I attempted to talk to my<br/>\ninstructor about unschooling, but he thinks homeschoolers are kind of nuts,<br/>\nthat &quot;everyone&quot; goes to college these days, and &quot;how are you going to know<br/>\nthey are properly progressing&quot; if you don&#39;t test them.  It doesn&#39;t help that<br/>\nI&#39;m the resident &quot;pinko&quot; in a nest of Republicans &lt;g&gt;.You get the picture.<br/>\nAmazingly, I love this guy dearly and he tolerates me quite well too :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI refuse to grade my dd but I don&#39;t want my instructor to subconsciously<br/>\nthink less of her (I don&#39;t think he would purposely fail her on her belt<br/>\ntest or anything like that.)  My plan was to write a brief summary of the<br/>\nthings she likes to do and &quot;schooly&quot; skills that she possesses.  Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the &quot;aha&quot; moment.  I have been actively working for about 2 years to<br/>\nlessen the coercion with my kids.  I have always tried to listen to them,<br/>\nwork with them gently, etc., but there was no question that I was the boss.<br/>\nMost days we do pretty good, when I am stressed, not so good.  I easily<br/>\nresort back to control and have to actively watch myself.  My 5yo, Marsie,<br/>\nis the real life version of Junie B. Jones and I adore her.  She is a prima<br/>\ndonna which is quite difficult when you are the middle of 5 children.  She<br/>\nis very dramatic and when things don&#39;t go her way, she is given to loud and<br/>\ntearful exits.  I usually see these things coming (usually when she is not<br/>\nin sufficient control of everything and everybody to suit her) and would<br/>\nsuggest going for a walk, playing with me, etc..  Nothing helped much.  Then<br/>\nit finally dawned on me......why not give her a place where she can be in<br/>\ntotal control?  We talked about &quot;Marsie time&quot; and when she starts to feel<br/>\nout of sorts she now asks for it.  It is complete and total control over her<br/>\ndomain for as long as she wants it.  She goes to her room and locks the door<br/>\nand plays and plays and plays. She wears her princess crown and the magician<br/>\ncape I made for her (she likes to make us disappear when we have offended<br/>\nher sensibilities &lt;g&gt;), takes a tape player and listens to &quot;Problem Child&quot;<br/>\nby AC/DC very loud (hmmmm.)  From the outside, it looks no different than<br/>\nMarsie going to her room until she feels like being civil (which is what<br/>\nused to be asked of her and she would melt into a tantrum) but by couching<br/>\nit in terms of her needs, how to meet those needs rather than control them,<br/>\nshe thinks it is a great idea and actively participates in utilizing it.  I<br/>\nthink there is hope for us yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4318,"nextTopicId":4332}}
