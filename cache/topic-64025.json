Do you know what brings your soul alive, and are you doing that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that as an unschooling mom, I need to be a leader, as well as facilitator and partner. Wait, strike that.

He might not want to go on a hike with you, but if hiking is your thing, you can walk around the block a couple times without leaving him for too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeed your passion, and invite him in. Are you being the kind of person he wants to be with?

If he isn&#39;t playing<br/>\nvideo games, he&#39;s watching Netflix and playing with his Nerf swords.  He<br/>\nswitches back and forth every few hours depending on which of his Xbox live<br/>\nfriends are online at any given time.  He eats and sleeps in front of the<br/>\nTV, not even wanting to turn the TV off for family dinners (something that<br/>\nhe once insisted on having at least a few times a week).  He does stop long<br/>\nenough to pitch in around the house when he sees us going on a cleaning<br/>\nspree, but doesn&#39;t take any initiative to do any cleaning up after himself<br/>\non a regular basis.  He wears the same clothes for days at a time and I<br/>\nhave to ask him twice a week to take a shower (and where he doesn&#39;t fight<br/>\nme exactly, he does complain about it and it becomes a day full of<br/>\nreminders about a shower).  I still have to remind him to brush his teeth<br/>\non a somewhat daily basis and most of the time he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe no longer goes outside to do anything, and it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s<br/>\nwinter, we live in Florida so it&#39;s still warm out most days.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go to the homeschool park days anymore because he doesn&#39;t get along<br/>\nwith a few of the kids that are there.  I&#39;ve tried setting up get togethers<br/>\nwith the homeschoolers outside of park day and they always fall through.<br/>\n He&#39;s not interested in any of the library programs or anything else that<br/>\nthe homeschoolers in the area do, and we haven&#39;t been able to find any<br/>\nunschoolers.  Since he doesn&#39;t go outside he hasn&#39;t met many neighborhood<br/>\nkids, and the one he did meet he doesn&#39;t get along with.  He has no friends<br/>\nin person, however he has tons of friends online (some of them he also<br/>\ntexts with and calls occasionally but all of them are too far away for<br/>\nmeeting in real life).  I think these online friendships are great (I met<br/>\nmy partner online) but I also think real live in person friendships are<br/>\nimportant as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been gaining weight for awhile now and it&#39;s bothering him.  I know<br/>\nthat weight gain at his age is normal, because most likely he&#39;ll hit a<br/>\ngrowth spurt any time now.  I keep reassuring him that it&#39;s okay, but in<br/>\nthe back of my mind (knowing that my sons father, myself and my partner are<br/>\nall overweight) I do worry at times.  I&#39;ve had to stop almost every one of<br/>\nmy family members mid-sentence as they start to say something about his<br/>\nweight because he&#39;s always been tall and skinny for his age and now he&#39;s<br/>\nnot.  He used to be a very active kid, always going and doing something,<br/>\nnow he just wants to sit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been radically unschooling for 2 or 3 years now and I thought I had<br/>\nfigured this stuff out.  He spends months at a time with his father (in<br/>\nanother state) and that tends to start the deschooling all over again<br/>\nbecause his father gets on him and I about &quot;doing real school work&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;doing something with his life.&quot;  He&#39;s been home for over 3 months now and<br/>\nthis time we&#39;re not moving into any other interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally when he gets back from his dads the first week or two are all<br/>\nvideo games all the time, then we start moving into different interests and<br/>\nexpanding on the video games.  At one point about a year ago he expressed<br/>\nan interest in stop motion photography, so I helped him set things up and<br/>\nwe did one video.  He loved it, loved showing it to everyone, but never<br/>\nwent back to it.  He used to pull out action figures and Mega Blocks Halo<br/>\nsets and set up elaborate scenes with them, but not anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I want him to stop the video games.  I fully support him<br/>\nplaying.  We&#39;re constantly buying new and better games whenever we can and<br/>\nI love the enjoyment he gets out of the games.  I love hearing the deep<br/>\nbelly laugh he gets when he and his friends are joking around online.  It&#39;s<br/>\nthat I feel like there should be more to life then sitting in the same spot<br/>\nfor days in a row.  He&#39;s using the video games and movies as an escape from<br/>\nreality I think, but I&#39;m not sure how to make reality more exciting than<br/>\n(or as exciting as) the video games especially since he doesn&#39;t have any<br/>\nfriends except for online.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little voice in the back of my head has been telling me something&#39;s<br/>\nwrong for a little while now, but now his father and my partner are also<br/>\nsaying something has to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we move beyond this and into the part where we expand on his<br/>\ninterests?
