I have been married for 13 years and<br/>\ncourted my husband three years before that. Two years back we realised that<br/>\nwe were both getting increasingly angry and irritable at each other. I being<br/>\nthe woman was always passively angry, which led to suppression of the self<br/>\nand led to the growth of more anger within. My husband on the other hand<br/>\nwould be actively angry. So we were having more fights, and he has hit me a<br/>\nfew times too over the last 13 years that we have been together.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime I would stay upset for a while, he would say sorry and then move<br/>\non.

Plainly I needed help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the last time he hit me, I decided to seriously do something about it. I<br/>\ntook on the responsibility to sort things out in my family. I took the<br/>\nresponsibility to cleanse all the knots and muck that was inside me. Because<br/>\nI realised one thing that &quot;IF WE WERE BOTH NOT SUCH BAD PEOPLE THEN WHY WAS<br/>\nTHIS HAPPENING&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly and sincerely took on the task of deep inner work with the sole aim<br/>\nof getting my family dynamics on the &#39;right&#39; track. That is a family were<br/>\nthere is peace, harmony and the freedom to express emotions in a controlled<br/>\nand unattached manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been very hard on me and my husband (who initially for almost a year<br/>\nrefused to see that things needed work). I moved out and moved in with my<br/>\nparents with the children. My husband moved to another town with a job int<br/>\nhe same company. Because to me it was very clear that we needed to look<br/>\nwithin ourselves to see what was not right with us individually to make our<br/>\ncollective lives better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut believe me not for once have I thought of divorce.
