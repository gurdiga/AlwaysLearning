There might be many reasons you haven&#39;t received a<br/>\nresponse to your post but taking Jacki&#39;s comment out of context and<br/>\nsupplying some sinister meaning of your own isn&#39;t one. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your post didn&#39;t speak to the majority of the people here. <br/>\nPerhaps people are still considering it and are formulating a response. <br/>\nPerhaps people are busy and don&#39;t have time to read and reply to every<br/>\ntopic.   Perhaps they&#39;re way ahead of you, have considered these things<br/>\nand don&#39;t feel the need for further discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPost something else if you think you can contribute more to the ideas<br/>\nyou&#39;ve already expressed and maybe you&#39;ll spark someone&#39;s interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Can we just discuss the IDEAS, without waiting to be told how and <br/>\nwhat to think? That is the point! Model thinking, not following! But <br/>\nstep gently on that trap door....THINK WITH YOUR OWN MIND!***<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discuss ideas here all the time and the idea you have that anyone here<br/>\nis waiting to be told how to think is wrong.   If you think that badly of<br/>\nyour fellow list members you won&#39;t be able to contribute as positively to<br/>\nthe list as you otherwise might.   I hope you reconsider. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was an attachment parent before I ever heard the name Sandra Dodd.  My<br/>\nson chose to stay out of school before I ever heard of unschooling or<br/>\nSandra.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I did read her articles I was pleased to find someone who had a<br/>\ntalent for sharing well thought out ideas and I felt relieved there was<br/>\nsomeone out there, even if I didn&#39;t know her, who shared some of my<br/>\nphilosophies .    I have learned a lot from Sandra but I&#39;ve learned even<br/>\nmore from my son.   If I *am* a follower, I follow him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your post regarding the reasons some kids might choose school, I<br/>\nthink I know what you&#39;re trying to say.   Some kid might still think<br/>\nschool is the best way to learn because there is still some residual<br/>\nschool think in the mind and language of his  parents leading him to that<br/>\nconclusion.  Parents do have a responsibility to turn off the school<br/>\nbackground noise if they want their kids to be able to do it.   Of<br/>\ncourse, some kids choose school for other reasons.   There is a point<br/>\nalong the unschooling path where people can see all things within the<br/>\ncontext of unschooling and use the parts of those things as they like and<br/>\nin ways that will benefit them.  If you&#39;ve never read Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;The Three Stages of Unschooling&quot; you might enjoy it.  I think it&#39;s at<br/>\nSandra&#39;s website.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as an unschooled child choosing school,  I have no experience<br/>\nwith that.  Because Dylan has never been to school, he has never thought<br/>\nschool was the place for learning.   Because he&#39;s never used a curriculum<br/>\nhe never thinks the best place to get information or knowledge is a text<br/>\nbook.    In fact he doesn&#39;t say &quot;I want to learn about (blank)&quot;  at all. <br/>\n  He&#39;s not seeking out learning opportunities, he&#39;s living and doing the<br/>\nthings he&#39;s interested in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20685,"nextTopicId":20688}}
