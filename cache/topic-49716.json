You can&#39;t rely on your children&#39;s sense of self preservation to keep them safe, they need you to be there with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n***i wanted to finish up cleaning the kitchen before bed so i could not hang out with them.***<br/>\n<br/>\nA clean kitchen is not more important than safe, happy kids.  You can clean the kitchen when one or both kids are asleep.  Or, like others have suggested, have one kid with you in the kitchen while the other is happily doing something he /she likes.  Or have them both with you in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\n***And he does this a lot lately, i ask him to stop somthing for what ever reason he says ok,sorry,then he does it again and says sorry***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s related to impulse control and before a child has the ability to control strong impulses no amount of mom yelling or punishment will make him get it.  It comes with growth and maturity.  And you will not be a good example of impulse control if, as the grown up, you can&#39;t control your impulse to yell. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I feel like i need him to focus so he can learn my needs to feel safe, just as i focus on his needs to feel safe, he is only 4 is this appropriate of me.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is too little to be in charge of your needs and he&#39;s too little to be in charge of his sister&#39;s safety.  If you need your children to be safe then *you* need to be with them and keep the situation safe.  Take one kid with you to another room if they&#39;re not getting along.  Distract and engage a cranky child, make sure the four year old is not left in charge of his sister, that&#39;s not his job. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** My husband and i have modelled a very poor relationship for the most part, my husband usually ignores me most of the time,while he dotes constantly on the children.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry he ignores you but it&#39;s good that he pays attention to his kids.  Lot&#39;s of moms could tell you how difficult things can be with a (physically or emotionally) absent father.  I&#39;m not trying to minimize the significance of your situation but rather show you some little positive thing that you might build on.   You can&#39;t force him to pay attention to you but you can pay attention to him.   Bake some nice thing they all like and take it to where they&#39;re playing.  Pick out some new toys with your husband in mind.  Make it easier for him be with his kids if that&#39;s his thing. You&#39;ll be contributing to a happy relationship between your kids and their dad.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am very lonely for a healthy adult relationship. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a sibling or friend you can talk to every day?  That&#39;s not a perfect substitute for a partner but it might help you.  Have you tried keeping a journal?  It&#39;s not the same as pouring your heart out to a partner but it can be therapeutic for some people. <br/>\n<br/>\n***how can i interact with my son when he repeatidly does things that totally bother me and causes him to be the constant center of negative attention.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not doing things to bother you, he little.  He loves you and wants you to be a happy mom.  *You* are bothered.  And you can find a way to understand your son so that you won&#39;t be bothered.  You may have expectations that a four year old child simply cannot meet.  Change your expectations.  He cannot be the center of your negative attention if you stop being negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be way off the mark but something to consider.  Is it possible your husband pays a lot of attention to the kids because you&#39;re paying a lot of attention to the housework? <br/>\nIs it possible he pays attention to the kids because he feels he can&#39;t please you? <br/>\nIs it possible your negative feelings about your son are in part because you feel he&#39;s getting too much of your husband&#39;s attention? <br/>\nIf you are looking for everyone else to do things just right so that you can be happy that&#39;s too much pressure on them and an unrealistic expectation on your part.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***i dont want to yell any more.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people in the habit of yelling have really demanding standards they expect others to live up to.  If you yell a lot, your husbands devotion to the kids might be a response to that.  He might be spending his time with the people who seem to like him and who don&#39;t find fault.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people in the habit of yelling got yelled at a lot when they were little.  The way we talk to our kids, especially in times of stress, is the way they will talk to their kids and others, including their parents, in times of stress.  Maybe you can find some kind of redirection technique to help you in those moments you feel like yelling.  Take a deep breath and go in the bathroom and splash some cold water on your face. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake some time to do something physical every day.  If your husband is home at night, leave him with the kids and go swimming or go for a brisk walk.   Join a fitness class or jump rope in the backyard.   A half hour or an hour of physical activity a day can really change your mental state and help you think more clearly and be calmer.   I know it sounds like it&#39;s unrelated to the things you wrote about but it will help you feel better emotionally and when you feel better you can interact better with your family. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] rough play with toddlers","postDate":"1263901213","msgId":49732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5Q0REMDRELUJCMjEtNDA4MS1COEU2LTJEODg5MkEzRjREMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwMDQyOC4xMzcxLnFtQHdlYjMzMTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQwMDQyOC4xMzcxLnFtQHdlYjMzMTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49717,"nextInTopic":49736,"prevInTime":49731,"nextInTime":49733,"topicId":49716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you need to  <br/>\nleave, take one with you to do something fun. (Often having mom&#39;s  <br/>\nfull attention is fun for kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRules and orders are like remote parenting. You can&#39;t hand your son a  <br/>\npiece of yourself (a rule) and expect him to listen to it as though  <br/>\nit were you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, the two need to not be alone together. That&#39;s just your  <br/>\nreality until it isn&#39;t any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s bothering her, redirect him, give him some personal  <br/>\nattention, find him something better to do, find something better for  <br/>\nher to do. There&#39;s probably a build up and become aware of it before  <br/>\nit turns on her. He&#39;s trying to meet a need but just can&#39;t yet do it  <br/>\nin a more socially acceptable way.

Undoubtedly there&#39;s a huge  <br/>\nhistory that has led to this but people don&#39;t turn away for no  <br/>\nreason. Perhaps a series of hurts you&#39;ve each done to the other (many  <br/>\nprobably without even realizing it) that have built to the point you  <br/>\nfeel justified in being hurtful and have eroded the trust.

Or sometimes he says no i want to do it.  Tongiht when he go back and jumped around on the couch i just started screaming, he said oh sorry i&#39;ll stop i forgot.  Me very frustrated turned off the tv and made him totally melt down.  I proceeded to scream and drill him, i said i turned off the tv because you were jumping on the couch again with your sister there she could get hurt.  He says oh, sorry i wont do it again ( he allways says this and does it again as if i am programming him some how to do it ) so he is crying for the tv, i say why did i turn the tv<br/>\n off, he says because i am mad, why am i mad.
