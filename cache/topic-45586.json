It is  <br/>\nkinda like &quot;make the better choice,&quot; huh?  Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved this combination of languages:  &quot;In modern usage, a focused  <br/>\nkaizen that is designed to address a particular issue over the course  <br/>\nof a week is referred to as a &#39;kaizen blitz&#39;.&quot;   A Japanese/German  <br/>\ncombo term.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\n..... I opened up an email about kazien (it was trying to sell me  <br/>\nsomething). My curiosity was peaked so I looked it up. It is a great  <br/>\nconcept that applies aptly to what we do as unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though our families are not businesses the basic premise is the  <br/>\nsame, I believe. Kazien, which is Japanese, comes from kai (change)  <br/>\nand zen (good). According to Wikipedia it &quot;is a Japanese philosophy  <br/>\nthat focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of  <br/>\nlife.&quot; Kaizen is based on making changes anywhere that improvements  <br/>\ncan be made. It is about small changes all the time, monitoring the  <br/>\nresults and then making more small changes and adjustments. This seems  <br/>\nlike what a lot of us do as we continue to grow as unschooling  <br/>\nparents. Little shifts and changes all the time, like little  <br/>\nexperiments to see what can be tweaked in this moment to make life  <br/>\neven better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about how I had to slowly keep tweaking things to, for  <br/>\nexample, find a way to make it out the door on time without upsets.  <br/>\nTaking lots of suggestions into consideration, trying them, not  <br/>\ndiscounting anything off-hand. It was a process, and it still is a  <br/>\nprocess ... since my kids change everyday and what works one day may  <br/>\nnot be perfect for another day.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\n(The post was originally here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/45106\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/45106</a><br/>\nin a long thread called &quot;Radical Unschooling Let Down&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45458,"nextTopicId":45568}}
