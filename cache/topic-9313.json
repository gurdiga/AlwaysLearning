He plays often with the neighborhood kids, mostly<br/>\nolder<br/>\nkids, mixed genders, after school odf course He has his almost 3 sister<br/>\nhe<br/>\nplays with all day. We usually go to playgroup or parkday at least 1<br/>\ntime a<br/>\nweek and play for 2-4 hours with lots of kids. Occasionally I&#39;ll line up<br/>\na<br/>\nplaytime with another family. My deal is I&#39;m not in a social mood these<br/>\ndays.<br/>\nSo much so that I took a break from leading LLL meetings. I&#39;m growing I<br/>\nguess<br/>\nand need some refective time. I also am not into hosting families at my<br/>\nhouse,<br/>\ntoo messy, not enough room for big play. I&#39;ll meet people at the park. I<br/>\nbabysat for a while and I think I&#39;m burned out form taking care of even<br/>\nmore<br/>\nkids. I should be sending my kids to a baysitter. The other thing is my<br/>\nguy<br/>\ndoes not really like alot of the other kids his age. He misses his<br/>\nfriend who<br/>\nmoved to Texas, so whenever I ask who to invite over, I get the sobs for<br/>\nan<br/>\nanswer about his friend. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering what other families have done to satisfy the need for<br/>\nunstructured group activity for the younger set. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.                                               <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
