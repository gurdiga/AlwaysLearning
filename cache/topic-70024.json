We used to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-607092610\">The de-fooding discussion and the description of kids who have always had a free choice with food has got me thinking about my two boys (10 and 7).  We used to control their food choices, mostly with sweets, but have loosened controls and they have had their choice for about 2 years (thats how long we&#39;ve been unschooling).  I reckon we changed too quickly in the beginning.  Within the first 6 months or so, both of my kids gained considerable weight (20 - 30 lbs).  Because they both gained weight at the same time I didn&#39;t think it was age/developmental related.  There were both lean kids, now they are almost considered obese (by their Doc.).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is:  Is there a way to help older kids get back in touch with their bodies.   I don&#39;t feel like my kids are listening to their bodies yet.  I&#39;m assuming that their weight gain was a response to years of being controlled.  Not following what their bodies needed.  I&#39;m also assuming that the body would not crave a situation that could set up health problems later e.g. gaining lots of fat that wasn&#39;t going to be used as growth fuel.  Has anyone else had an experience like this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have guilt that their weight gain is my fault (with the consequence of weight related health issues) and that the reason they haven&#39;t seemed to get in touch with their own bodies is that they feel I&#39;m still judging their choices even though I don&#39;t do it aloud.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69932,"nextTopicId":70021}}
