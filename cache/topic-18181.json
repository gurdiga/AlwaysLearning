Anyhow I wanted to give my <br/>\nviews on the topics being discussed.<br/>\nAs far as menstral periods I frankly prefer tampons, my parents <br/>\ndidn&#39;t tell me about them, instead they bought me these hughly thick <br/>\nbig pads when I started my period -- first day of jr high school -- <br/>\nI really dislike thinking of those memories. Well luckily life has <br/>\nmoved on since then and I have found that OB tampons are my favorite <br/>\nbecause you just use your finger to position them which for me is <br/>\nmore comfortable than cardboard or plastic applicator - when I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad to borrow one it always seemed like I used the applicator and <br/>\nthen had to &quot;reposition&quot; it until it was comfortable anyhow. I also <br/>\nthought that tampons were just cotten so what else is in there that <br/>\nis so unnatural? Also the OB tampons come in several sizes of which <br/>\ngirls can always use the smaller size.<br/>\nAs for potty training boys I&#39;ve done that a few times, my son was <br/>\ntotally trained and when he went to preschool (didn&#39;t last long but <br/>\nthat&#39;s another story) he was having an accident everyday. We finally <br/>\ngot it out of him that it was because he wasn&#39;t pulling his pants <br/>\ndown like he had learned at home but he was just pushing them down <br/>\nfar enough to get the penis out and then would pee because that is <br/>\nwhat he saw the other boys in his class doing. I felt bad because I <br/>\nhad never shown this to him so he had no experiences at keeping his <br/>\nelastic banded pants from going back up while he was peeing - <br/>\ntherefor the accidents!!! And of course his pants were only a little <br/>\nwet in front but my son is particular about being dry so he would <br/>\nalways say he had an accident so the teacher would let him change <br/>\nclothes. I of course also got onto my husband about needing to go <br/>\npotty with him more as well. <br/>\nNow as for the nakedness I will say that I don&#39;t censor what my ds <br/>\nwatches on TV or the language he uses (although he doesn&#39;t really <br/>\nuse much &quot;bad&quot; language and he is only 5 almost 6. I don&#39;t really <br/>\nrun around the house naked much because I can&#39;t stand to be naked <br/>\nbecause my breasts went opposite directions after breastfeeding and <br/>\nI am afraid I would give a poor view of what women look like. My <br/>\nmother died of breast cancer and I have a sister who is recovered <br/>\n(hopefully) so I am prettymuch terrified of what my breasts look <br/>\nlike to be honest, and that is something I need to deal with and not <br/>\nhim. However if my son does come into my room while I am getting <br/>\ndressed or the bathroom when I&#39;m taking a shower I try to just go <br/>\nabout finishing what I&#39;m doing and not make a thing out of it. <br/>\nAnyhow I do think if the first exposure my son got of sex was a <br/>\nporno flick then it would be devistating, I would much rather him <br/>\nsee somekind of relationship going on as well as you do see in most <br/>\nmovies that have love scenes in them. But then he has sneaked up on <br/>\nme and his father (my husband) while we were kissing pretty <br/>\nintensely and didn&#39;t know he was standing there watching us and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think he thought much about it! Like it was just something <br/>\nnatural for mom&#39;s and dad&#39;s to do - which it is.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18201,"nextTopicId":18179}}
