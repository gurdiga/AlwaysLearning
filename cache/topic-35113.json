She<br/>\nwas writing about the inevitability of losing our tempers with our<br/>\nchildren and screaming and shouting at them and how parents can deal<br/>\nwith the consequences of that supposedly normal parenting experience.<br/>\nWithout feeling guilty, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my two decades plus of parenting experience, screaming and shouting<br/>\nat my children has simply never happened, neither from me nor from my<br/>\nwife. At worst, I occasionally raised my voice a notch or two to my<br/>\nson during his second year at school - maybe a dozen times in all -<br/>\nwhen his unhappiness with that situation ultimately started to express<br/>\nitself in disruptive behaviour. Easily resolved by getting him out of<br/>\nthe situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich doesn&#39;t mean I could be a better parenting coach. I don&#39;t do<br/>\n&#39;child management&#39; and that seems to be what most parents want.

I had taken money and cards out of my  <br/>\npocket because I was going to get messy, and Keith asked if I had my  <br/>\nphone.  I said yeah, it&#39;s pretty waterproof when it&#39;s closed.  (I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to get soaked, just mud-spattered.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo steps away from the porch, Kirby called.  It wasn&#39;t his lunchtime  <br/>\nat all.

But it was better than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had told his group not to say &quot;fire&quot; if they needed to leave an IM  <br/>\nor a phone conversation, just to say they&#39;d be back.  Others, though,  <br/>\nhad communicated to their clients that the building was on fire. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing that they only work with tech-connected people in all  <br/>\ndirections, he was afraid word would get out that there was a fire at  <br/>\nBlizzard&#39;s Austin facility, and that I would be worried.   Good  <br/>\nthinking on his part!!  I was going to be out in the mud and not at  <br/>\nthe computer, but wasn&#39;t that thoughtful of him to call me?

He never  <br/>\nquite recovered from moving to a new house.  He didn&#39;t get the room  <br/>\nhe wanted.  Puberty hit him hard and he was gone a lot, with work and  <br/>\nkarate.  I see ALL the negatives of some problems Kirby and I had.   <br/>\nThen I pull out the too-close focus and remember that my relationship  <br/>\nwith Kirby was better than ANY of our friends whose kids his age were  <br/>\nin school.  WAY better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby knew he was going to move, last summer, a kind of  <br/>\ncompensatory niceness came over him.  It seemed as though he had been  <br/>\nplanning to be nicer later, and his later was disappearing.  It was  <br/>\nall sunshine and roses from the time he knew he was getting a job in  <br/>\nTexas.  He calls me a couple of times a week just to see how I am.  I  <br/>\nforget to call him in the two very small windows in his day.  He&#39;s  <br/>\nawake for an hour before he gets to work, they&#39;re all like black-out  <br/>\nat work (no phones, no e-mail), he takes one break outside the  <br/>\nbuilding to eat and do errands, and gets home usually after I&#39;m in  <br/>\nbed.  He works ten hours lots of times, and currently is working  <br/>\neight days straight because they changed his two days off to  <br/>\nWednesday and Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know where he is, and I&#39;m glad to know what his apartment is  <br/>\nlike now, and he tells me stories and is really sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHis room did change.  The closet and half the shelves still have his  <br/>\nstuff where he left it but we moved the desk  (door on two bases with  <br/>\ndrawers) and that room is the games room now, kind of a den for  <br/>\nupstairs.

Something that I am<br/>\n&gt; slowly realizing is how many of these principles we are living already<br/>\n&gt; and that my husband is supportive of (ie eating, sleeping arrangements<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;bedtime&quot; etc.) This has made me realize that I don&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;discuss&quot; many of these things with him -- we just need to keep on<br/>\n&gt; living and learning together and if we need to work something in<br/>\n&gt; particular out, then we can discuss.

How often do I think those thoughts... A friend<br/>\n&gt; was looking of a picture of me and MG (my daughter) when she was about<br/>\n&gt; 9 months old, and she said, &quot;you look so happy!&quot; And I told, I am,<br/>\n&gt; every day! Every day since she was born... actually since I was pregnant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really consider myself a SAHM, although technically I &quot;work&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I watch a little boy who is 1 month older than my daughter full-time.<br/>\n&gt; His mom calls me his &quot;baby-sitter&quot; although most would call me his<br/>\n&gt; nanny. (I don&#39;t mind too much, in fact I kind of understand her<br/>\n&gt; aversion to the word &quot;nanny&quot;.) Anyways, I often think how watching<br/>\n&gt; this little boy actually helps keep me on track as a mom. Our days are<br/>\n&gt; really about them and their needs -- although I am getting mine filled<br/>\n&gt; too. We have play dates, go to playgrounds, the library, music class,<br/>\n&gt; sing, dance, read books, run, make funny faces, laugh, eat, nap... it<br/>\n&gt; is quite the good life!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have made some really good mommy friends since we moved. And<br/>\n&gt; talking to them and hanging out with them has clarified a lot of<br/>\n&gt; things for me. One of my friends works 2 days a week. Yesterday her<br/>\n&gt; daughter said to her husband and her, &quot;Mommy, Daddy - go back to<br/>\n&gt; work!&quot; She was having so much fun with her babysitter. My friend<br/>\n&gt; realized that she has to make her time with her daughter fun too.<br/>\n&gt; Similarly, one day last week the little boy&#39;s mom came home early and<br/>\n&gt; I had just gotten him up from nap. As soon as he saw her he gave a<br/>\n&gt; loud, dismayed, &quot;NO-oo-OOH!&quot; His mom and I both laughed, and she was a<br/>\n&gt; good sport and said &quot;Yes!&quot; with her arms wide open.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aside from the awkwardness I feel about this I also know that I<br/>\n&gt; personally would not deal well with this at ALL. I LOVE that I am<br/>\n&gt; still my daughter&#39;s favorite as she approaches 2. She still WANTS to<br/>\n&gt; be with me all the time! We do so many things together every day -<br/>\n&gt; eat, play, nurse, bathe, fall asleep... We make each other laugh! I<br/>\n&gt; know that it will not always be this way, but all the more reason to<br/>\n&gt; cherish it now. When MG was only 6 months there were people who said,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;She is still nursing?&quot; and &quot;She (me) is going to be a slave to that<br/>\n&gt; baby&quot;. Well if this is the kind of life a slave leads then call me a<br/>\n&gt; slave. I am in love and loving life. My baby (little girl!) is growing<br/>\n&gt; up quickly and beautifully and I am trying so hard to soak up as many<br/>\n&gt; moments as I can.
