It <br/>\nis as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to start a new job in two weeks.  My baby is nine months old <br/>\nand stays with her dad during the day, as he works the night shift.  <br/>\nWith my old job, he brought the baby to work at lunch so I only needed <br/>\nto pump once in the morning.  I am uncertain how to broach this <br/>\nbreastfeeding/pumping subject with my new manager.  How do I let my <br/>\nmanager know that my pumping will not affect my work, and how do I talk <br/>\nto him about the daily visits from my husband and infant? <br/>\n<br/>\nSend the responses to my email (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a>).
