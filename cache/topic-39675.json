He became  <br/>\nenamoured of road racing (vs. NASCAR-type racing) and made it his  <br/>\nhobby first, when he was old enough to drive (an obsession), and then  <br/>\nmade it his profession. Pretty much everything he&#39;s done since has had  <br/>\nsomething to do with racing or driving.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also loved wood working (making furniture) and pen & ink drawing  <br/>\nwhen I met him, but those interests have diminished over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a child, I wanted to play the harp. My parents couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nafford a harp (not many lap harps available then), so they bought me a  <br/>\nguitar. I loved it, took lessons, performed classical and pop music,  <br/>\nbut by the end of high school, I was pretty much done. I have talked  <br/>\nthrough the years about my childhood wish for a harp and my dh granted  <br/>\nme that wish for my 50th birthday. I now have a beautiful, hand-made- <br/>\nfrom-cherry-wood, Celtic harp which I rarely  play - to my dh&#39;s  <br/>\ndisappointment :-(. I think it&#39;s because the harp was a dream, and  <br/>\nperhaps a story of longing for something.

I took a break from writing and remembered something. Once I got  <br/>\nover the shock of getting a harp &lt;g&gt;, I did begin to play it and it  <br/>\nsounded beautiful. I took the harp over to my parents&#39; home to show it  <br/>\noff, and I plinked away on it, in the beginning stages of learning a  <br/>\nsong. My dad dismissed my novice efforts with &quot;Can&#39;t you play it yet?  <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t sound like a song.&quot;  I realize now, today, that I put it  <br/>\naway after that and have barely touched it since (about 2 years ago).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help knowing that my dad was diagnosed with dementia not  <br/>\nlong after that. That comment from him stopped me from pursuing a life- <br/>\nlong dream and I wonder how many other things I didn&#39;t do because of  <br/>\nwanting to be approved of by him. He died this July (after my beloved  <br/>\nand supportive mother died last December), so perhaps my life will  <br/>\nopen up in a new way.

I  <br/>\nnever knew exactly what the show was, but I didn&#39;t care.   Then Keith  <br/>\nwent to do something else, and a show in Mendelbrat and fractal  <br/>\ngeometry came on, and I finished the puzzles by myself (we had three  <br/>\nmatching mixed-up ones we were doing at the same time).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the puzzles were done, I moved over closer to the TV and really  <br/>\nlistened to the rest of that show, wishing it would get boring.

His biggest one is  marine life. It started with sharks (they are still one of his favourite things in life) and then grew and grew to an interest in all sea life. He is at his most content when his face is down looking into a rockpool, bucket and net close by, searching for sea creatures. He just loves it. He talks about wanting to be a marine biologist and also owning a salt water aquarium when he&#39;s older. Other interests have come and gone. Others still are put on the shelf for awhile and then brought back when his interest is renewed by seeing it somewhere else (TV, shops etc) or talking about it with someone. I know this is what many unschoolers find in their children and themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like my son&#39;s interests have the potential to be life long because he has the freedom to go with them or drop them like a hot potato which ever he chooses to do. When our kids get the freedom to have unlimited stimulation/exposure to an interest they can take it to a level that others, unfortunately can&#39;t due to time restrictions and schedules. Whether they take their interests right through life or not doesn&#39;t really matter though of course, my point is that they can if they want to and noone&#39;s going to be pushing them to try something else or balance themselves with other things or whatever it is many parents seem to feel they need to do to &#39;make&#39; their kids be the people they want them to become.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I feel is that when we stop looking at our kids and what they do through schooly glasses, we&#39;re no longer concerned about how long they&#39;ve been interested in something, or how much time they&#39;ve spent doing something but rather we&#39;re in there with them, their passion leaking onto us and giving us abit of that passion too. It just becomes life and living not some thing they&#39;re doing to because it&#39;s good for them or because they&#39;ll need it when they&#39;re an adult or whatever other reason school says kids should do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this about unschooling - the boxing in of learning gradually dissapates to nothingness and life is just what it is, free of subjects and rigid boxes of controlled learning. Interests can be seen as school subjects - something we do when we&#39;ve got the time to do them or when someones  else says we&#39;ve got time because we&#39;ve done all the other really important things we had to do during the day.Or, for unschoolers,  interests become  part of the fabric of each day, blending in and out, weaving their magic throughout our day as equal to living us as breathing and eating are. No need then to think about the &#39;role interests play&#39; or where might our kids take the interests or when will they have enough of this and move onto something else. This kind of thinking doesn&#39;t enter the equation anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim H<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 29, 2008 4:01 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] obsessions dying off?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ***Was it in this forum or on the FamilyRUNing site that someone was <br/>\n<br/>\n  talking about video game interest running its course, or him finally <br/>\n<br/>\n  losing interest?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is the idea that an interest will peak and then fade a school thing? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Like &quot;the class is over&quot; or &quot;he&#39;ll grow out of it&quot; or what?

Or how about if someone loved painting, would we be holding our breaths until she/he stopped painting and be so happy that they are doing something else?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that people will sometimes think that while deschooling a child will play lots of video games or watch lots of TV and then when they do stop doing those things it means their done deschooling.  Not necessarily so.   And in my opinion it&#39;s usually the adults who need the deschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t mean to confuse people who are new to unschooling but for me.. getting unschooling was more about helping my kids do what they like to do.  Sometimes it meant that they&#39;d be interested in one thing for  a long time, but other times they&#39;d move on to other things too.  My daughters will do lots of stuff at one time but my son will often do more of a hyper focus on something.  He&#39;s very thorough in anything he does.  I&#39;m not worried about Alec, my son, who likes to play a lot of video games because he&#39;s happy and engaged.  He&#39;s Alec.. and I&#39;m going to help him (when he wants the help ;) to be the Alec that he feels he wants and needs to be.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;  Dan Millman,  Peaceful Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.avg.com\">http://www.avg.com</a> <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.175 / Virus Database: 270.8.4/1750 - Release Date: 10/27/2008 6:14 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: obsessions dying off?","postDate":"1225228122","msgId":39695,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU3MkIyQTVCLTZGRkMtNDA0My05NjUxLTM2N0YxM0ZFQzUzOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlN3QwZStxYjQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlN3QwZStxYjQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39690,"nextInTopic":39697,"prevInTime":39694,"nextInTime":39696,"topicId":39675,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I still said, This too shall pass. -=- That was it!
