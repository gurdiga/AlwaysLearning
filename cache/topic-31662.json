To me, you represented the epitome of everything ridiculous  <br/>\nin our society that got in the way of my raising my son �right.�  I  <br/>\nhad also never watched an episode.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings changed after I read the education book, �Teach Your Own� by  <br/>\nJohn Holt.  I got so excited about the wonderful homeschooling ideas  <br/>\nhe wrote about!  I hosted a discussion group about it on January 5,  <br/>\n2007, and that&#39;s when I began to get to know you, and my son, in a  <br/>\nbrand new way.  It marks the beginning of my conscious focus on  <br/>\nfollowing Declan&#39;s lead about his interests which, of course, included  <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result of his passionate interest in you, we lifted the TV  <br/>\nrestrictions in our home and ended up watching lots of your shows.   <br/>\nAfter a while, I found myself laughing at your crazy encounters with  <br/>\nSquidward, cracking up at Patrick&#39;s jokes, appreciating Sandy&#39;s Texas  <br/>\nspunk, smiling at Mrs. Puff&#39;s classroom management techniques,  <br/>\ngiggling at Mr. Krabs&#39; extreme frugality, and wondering what Plankton  <br/>\nwould do next in his quest to take over the Krusty Krab.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you portray the ridiculous in your show � we&#39;re talking  <br/>\nabout conversing crustaceans and their underwater lives, complete with  <br/>\nrestaurants and motorboats.  But to consider you as something  <br/>\nnegative, irrelevant, or even evil?  Never again.  I regret that my  <br/>\npast negative feelings about you could have led my son to feel like he  <br/>\nwas shallow, or worse, a bad person, for enjoying you.  I judged you  <br/>\nbased on false assumptions.  Exactly what I strive not to do.  And  <br/>\nsomething I hope my children would never do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI adore you, SpongeBob.  I relate to your enthusiasm and openness when  <br/>\npursuing new ideas, interests, and adventures.  I&#39;m inspired by your  <br/>\nboundless optimism and enchanted by your bright, happy outlook on the  <br/>\nworld.  To me, you represent a lifestyle that embraces a zest for  <br/>\nliving, the way I want life to feel in our home.  But most of all, I  <br/>\nappreciate the connection you&#39;ve helped me to establish with my son  <br/>\naround something he loves.  It has been a valuable gateway to  <br/>\ncountless other interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for providing me with an amazing opportunity to connect with  <br/>\nDeclan at his level, on his terms, not filtered through my own likes  <br/>\nand dislikes.  I don&#39;t want him limited to choices within a range of  <br/>\nwhat I like or am familiar with.  The world is bigger than me and my  <br/>\nexperience.  He is here to walk his path in his own way.  I am here as  <br/>\na loving guide helping him to access and navigate this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, I share with him my ways and views about life.  So why wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nI be open to his?  In his own unique way?  Even if we don&#39;t share the  <br/>\nsame tastes.  I don&#39;t have to like everything he likes.  But to ignore  <br/>\nor not take seriously his deep interest in something?  Not to learn  <br/>\nmore about something that&#39;s important to him?  That feels wrong to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watch you together now, SpongeBob.  I love hearing Declan&#39;s  <br/>\nreactions to what happens with you and your friends.  Now that I&#39;m a  <br/>\nregular viewer, I know what&#39;s going on in your life �down, down, down  <br/>\nat the bottom of the sea,� and can offer context to my son&#39;s  <br/>\nspontaneous, seemingly random comments or questions about a scene he  <br/>\nsaw.  This mama now considers you her favorite cartoon.  Here&#39;s to  <br/>\nmany more years of happiness together!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nErica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Problem Solving","postDate":"1199100124","msgId":31669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdEOEVFRTUzLUIyN0YtNDhBRC04RUMwLTFCQzczMEQ5OEI1NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDcxMjMwMDgxOG0zZDE0NThjY3BlMTQ4MDkxMDNhOWEzOTVkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDcxMjMwMDgxOG0zZDE0NThjY3BlMTQ4MDkxMDNhOWEzOTVkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31668,"nextInTopic":31670,"prevInTime":31668,"nextInTime":31670,"topicId":31662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I guess <br/>\nit is a bit surprising how sometimes kids need to go through a learning <br/>\nprocess a few times to see that the principles are constant (or something) <br/>\nand don&#39;t &quot;get  it&quot; from the first experience. Once I let go of any <br/>\nexpectation that &quot;saying it once should be enough&quot; I got to feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times our neighbors come and play separate computer, hand held <br/>\nand/or x-box games at our house as the first choice of activity. When <br/>\neveryone is playing it is very peaceful and pleasant. Everyone celebrates <br/>\neach other&#39;s successes and task completions. Sometimes all three will crowd <br/>\naround the DS to watch a replay and cheer. The little boy will come and read <br/>\nscreens for Jayn or his sister. They constantly talk about what they are <br/>\ndoing and help each other. Sometimes I am called to help too. The activity <br/>\nis not isolating at all most of the time. Then after a while one or another <br/>\nwill be done with the computer/game and will start playing dolls. They <br/>\neventually they will all start making a fort or something or go outside to <br/>\nmake their sweet Harry Potter play (with props and costumes). :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there is some other activity that Hannah could do right by the <br/>\ncomputer.

I sit by Jayn a lot <br/>\nwith my laptop or writing notebook or my loom knittng or my beading and get <br/>\nto multitask to the extent that she will let me between helping her with <br/>\nvarious tasks. Her latest game interest in Nancy Drew - and there are some <br/>\nreally tough puzzles.

The current situation looks something like this<br/>\n(although we have variants on a regular basis)...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s schooled friend Hannah is over during her vacation.  Marti (my<br/>\ndd) is always asking if Hannah can come over.  Now that she is here though,<br/>\nall Marti wants to do is play video games (which is fine, normally), but she<br/>\nexpects Hannah to just sit there and watch her.  Hannah keeps trying to get<br/>\nup which leads me to believe that Hannah is bored.  So Marti moves from<br/>\nvideo game to video game trying to keep Hannah wanting to just sit there and<br/>\nwatch her, but Hannah would rather go and play with the younger kids.  Marti<br/>\ngets upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Marti sulks on the couch.  I try to go comfort her.  I try and give her<br/>\nideas to help her.  She could play a 2 player game, she could try playing<br/>\nsomething Hannah wants to play, etc.  My ideas only make her more upset and<br/>\nfrustrated.  She attacks all my ideas with reasons why those things won&#39;t<br/>\nwork.  Clearly she doesn&#39;t want my advice so I end up walking away (due to<br/>\nmy own frustration many times), but then she is still upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could I be doing better?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nWife to Roger (nearly 10 years)<br/>\nMum to Marti (7) and Lilly (4)<br/>\nBabysitter to Stella (3)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Real luxury is time and opportunity to read for pleasure&quot;<br/>\n-Jane Brody<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31661,"nextTopicId":31679}}
