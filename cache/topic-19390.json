I am acting <br/>\nmature, being sensitive to harshness is not an immature state of being. <br/>\nNot being able to see how one moves about in the world is not a virtue, <br/>\nespecially when one tends to steamroll people for no particular reason. <br/>\nAttacking someone who is quite obviously already down is just plain <br/>\nmean, and in this case starting to look pathological.
