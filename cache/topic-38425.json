It was good!  I took notes and I don&#39;t know where they  <br/>\nare, but a mom had taken a 14 year old boy out of school in NYC.   <br/>\nAfrican-American family.  She was a professor I think, but I guess  <br/>\nhad taken a leave of absence to homeschool him.  And at 16 he had  <br/>\nbeen accepted to a school for the arts (he plays cello), so I guess  <br/>\nJulliard but it might&#39;ve been another one; they didn&#39;t specify.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they talked about Calvert curriculum and showed them loading  <br/>\nboxes assembly-line style, and talked about how old Calvert is, and  <br/>\nthen they interviewed a dad who  has made a curriculum and is making  <br/>\ntons of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I thought was cool is that they creditted the 60&#39;s and hippies  <br/>\nfor starting it, and then said something about John Holt probably  <br/>\n(Honestly, I don&#39;t remember) and then said fundamentalist Christians  <br/>\ncame to homeschooling in droves after it was legal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVERY often it has been told from the Christian homeschooling  <br/>\nperspective, where they take credit for ALL of homeschooling&#39;s  <br/>\nexistence and legality, and then throw in a snarky comment on non- <br/>\nChristians who jumped on their pristine bandwagon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this one was closer to objective than any major story I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t about unschooling, but that&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38401,"nextTopicId":38154}}
