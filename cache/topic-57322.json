This is one of the biggest<br/>\nreasons that I see unschooling as better than schooling. Unschooling can<br/>\npurposely avoid categorizing things for the children and appreciate what<br/>\ncategorizing the child does.

Meanwhile, learning actually<br/>\nhappens despite not always being appreciated for what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing about unschooling is that it lets learning happen however it<br/>\nactually happens, skips trying to fixate on or formulate it, and says all<br/>\nlearning is worthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen James","from":"Karen James &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling and math","postDate":"1285102640","msgId":57457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltRkhBSGdlZkVzZ1NQeVJPdVNWYmdWR19VQW0weXJPSnNnNW9qUEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMjc1N0U3LTVGMjgtNDE0OC04MkJELUU2OUZFRkU1QkI4RkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGk3YTZpcitnbWVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MjAyNzU3RTctNUYyOC00MTQ4LTgyQkQtRTY5RkVGRTVCQjhGQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":57452,"nextInTopic":57460,"prevInTime":57456,"nextInTime":57458,"topicId":57322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... though - reading stories like this and thinking that s not my kid, ...

I remember stories of things he said when he was 4, that exemplified this perspective in his real life, with regard to the time it would take me to get back to pick him up, proportional to the total time he was going to be at preschool, etc., but not enough detail to convey them.  but when he was 6, and in first grade (this is a story about how school squelches natural mathematical thinking), during perhaps the first week of class, the teacher was doing a &quot;number game&quot; wherein the kids were to call out different &quot;math sentences&quot; that equaled 10.  the kids took turns with contributions like &quot;5 plus 5&quot; and &quot;12-2&quot; and my son called out &quot;5 divided by a half&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nthe teacher thought he was wrong.  she thought he meant 5 divided IN half and asked him to explain how he came up with that.  it wasn&#39;t until the next day that she realized her mistake (after talking to her scientist husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyhow, that was something that my son had NEVER received &quot;instruction&quot; or even explanation about - he just *got it* - because it made sense to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nfast forward 3.5 years after that day and he was pretty sure he didn&#39;t like math.  he still has very little interest in &quot;formal&quot; math, although a good ability to add numbers in his head.

Kids who don&#39;t want to write a novel are still learning about writing and literature, though, and kids who don&#39;t get a kick out of percentages still learn the principles of mathematics. Sometimes parents get stuck there, though - reading stories like this and thinking &quot;that&#39;s not my kid, guess I can&#39;t unschool math&quot;. It isn&#39;t true, but it takes a little more trust and understanding about natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling and math","postDate":"1285022068","msgId":57430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltbjhIMFc1ellVMHROdXk3dmdxVGM4RThjNHFxd1piQjd4cXlGN0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3MTM3My40MTY1My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWNiNTVjNyQ3YzU5YmRhMCQ3NTBkMzhlMCRAY29tPgk8MjQ2MTIxQjYtRTZFMS00QjZGLTg5RjEtOUFEMEQzOUNFOUJDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8NDcxMzczLjQxNjUzLnFtQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57359,"nextInTopic":57443,"prevInTime":57429,"nextInTime":57431,"topicId":57322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karl totally gets the number games that he plays.

I&#39;ve not read much lately  but<br/>\nI&#39;ve missed it and hope to begin reading more and participating more.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis last year was the most difficult of my life as my youngest daughter<br/>\nbattled a rare autoimmune disorder that left her completely incapacitated<br/>\nfor 6 months and somewhat incapacitated for many more months.  The last year<br/>\nwas really a blur of caring for her and figuring out this rarely diagnosed<br/>\ndisorder and getting her the right treatment.  She&#39;s doing much better now<br/>\nand I will write more about it in a future post, but for now I wanted to<br/>\nwrite about her transition to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe decided this fall to take a couple classes at the high school.  She is<br/>\ntaking Creative Writing and Art.  Not rocket science, I know, but having<br/>\nbeen too ill to even read a book or write anything at all for most of the<br/>\nlast year, I wanted her to transition slowly and to not take on more than<br/>\nshe could handle if her health took a turn for the worse.  She got her first<br/>\ngrade yesterday and she did all the work on her own.  She got an 86 on a<br/>\nstory outline, character sketch, and first page of her 4 page story.  She<br/>\nhas had NO formal writing classes and I did not spend any time before the<br/>\nclass preparing her specifically for this class.  She is taking the classes<br/>\nat the high school and she will be 14 next week, so she is one of the<br/>\nyoungest in her grade.  The class is an elective and it&#39;s a  mixed grade<br/>\nclass.  Freshmen through seniors.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I don&#39;t put a lot of faith in grades as a true reflection of what<br/>\nis learned but it was nice to see that she could transition so easily and I<br/>\nknow these stories help other&#39;s when they are worrying.  She is already well<br/>\nliked by her two teachers and she feels like the kids have been friendly and<br/>\nkind to her and I have to say that the experience I&#39;ve had so far in dealing<br/>\nwith the school has been a positive one. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n If I had done this a year ago, I might have gone into it feeling stressed<br/>\nout, worrying  about how she would do or how I might be perceived by the<br/>\nmainstream, but I am just so thankful for her health at this point that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t give a flying f*** what anyone thinks and since this is what she wants<br/>\nto do, I am there to help her do it. (despite the fact that jumping into the<br/>\ngerm pool isn&#39;t the best thing for her)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is still at home.  She&#39;s taking drivers ed and working at the barn<br/>\nwhere she rides a lot.  She&#39;s happy staying home at this point though she<br/>\nhas become very independent this last year and I know she could do anything<br/>\nshe set her mind to. Through the trials of the last year she has been great<br/>\n(responsible, kind, patient, etc) despite the fact that her life as she knew<br/>\nit came to a screeching halt.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re taking one day at a time.
