Aggressive dogs<br/>\nshould not be kept, but they should be euthanized rather than placed<br/>\nelsewhere for someone else to deal with.  The exception to that would be<br/>\nif you have the 1) dog experience and 2) knowledge of that particular<br/>\ndog to place it 3) with someone who can handle the problem<br/>\nappropriately, and only then if 4) the problem is one that truly can be<br/>\nmanaged.  And these 4 parameters don&#39;t come together often.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd of course when you have lots of pets you have to prioritize how much<br/>\nyou&#39;ll spend to fix problems.  One of the reasons we&#39;re going down on<br/>\nour number of pets - strictly through attrition is that I don&#39;t like<br/>\nthat feeling of not being able to do everything financially for a pet I<br/>\nlove.  I pull out all the stops for my Dalmatians and cats, but not<br/>\nalways for the ferrets and rats.  The other reason is that my kids are<br/>\nactivity-manic, and we are home less (not homeless!) more than we used<br/>\nto be, and my dogs clearly miss us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen you have a breeding program, you have to place some of your<br/>\nanimals, but if it&#39;s done responsibly, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.<br/>\nThe problem I have is when people have a few pets, get rid of them<br/>\nbecause the kids are tired of them, then get more, rinse, repeat . . .<br/>\nA woman on a homeschool list recently wrote that she was looking for<br/>\nhomes for her son&#39;s frogs and gecko because he&#39;d lost interest in them<br/>\nsince they got a new puppy.  I wrote back a polite private message about<br/>\npet responsiblity and how very possible it was that he would also lose<br/>\ninterest in the puppy because that was the routine that was being set<br/>\nup.  I mentioned that none of my 4 kids had ever lost interest in any of<br/>\nthe 70+ pets we&#39;d had over the years.  She wrote back a very nice reply<br/>\nassuring me that they were very responsible about their pets.  My whole<br/>\npoint of the lesson her son was learning about pets and responsibility<br/>\ncompletely went over her head. <br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Pam Hartley [mailto:pamhartley@...] <br/>\nSent: Friday, April 05, 2002 12:19 PM<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschoolers/Pet Theory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Scott P.

Instead of the rules and structure that cause most folks to be<br/>\n&quot;practical&quot; about saying no to their kids when they want yet another<br/>\nanimal (or saying no to spouse), do we just wing it and take it &quot;one pet<br/>\nat a time&quot;, deciding whether no would be a more harmful answer than yes<br/>\neach time?  I don&#39;t want to sound like I advocate impulse pet<br/>\nacquisition, but I think it&#39;s okay to take on pets impulsively if you<br/>\nhave a firm commitment and policy in your home not to get rid of them<br/>\nonce to take them on.  I know so many people who are more structured<br/>\nthan we are who seem to need every i dotted and t crossed before they&#39;ll<br/>\nbring in a new pet, which doesn&#39;t allow for those times when your kid<br/>\njust really needs that new friend right now!<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is one of the most touching things I&#39;ve ever heard a parent say<br/>\nabout pets.  When I used to teach dog training classes, there was a<br/>\nfamily who brought their new shelter dog to class.  This dog was truly<br/>\nhomely and definitely lacking in what I would consider a good<br/>\ntemperament.  But she worked for them, and that&#39;s what counts.  The<br/>\nproblem was, she hadn&#39;t bonded to the child that needed a dog in that<br/>\nfamily, so although this woman had never been a pet person, and had to<br/>\nadjust to the idea of even one pet, she decided to get a 2nd dog for<br/>\nthis child.  This time I helped her pick a breed and a reputable breeder<br/>\nand they got an adorable Miniature Poodle puppy.  The puppy bonded to<br/>\nthe middle child in the family, as hoped, and all was well.  The mom<br/>\nsaid to me, &quot;I watched one daughter go through junior high school, and<br/>\npromised that I would never let another of my children go through those<br/>\ntough years without a friend to come home to besides mom.&quot;  While the<br/>\nargument could be made that if it&#39;s that tough to get through junior<br/>\nhigh, people should just homeschool, we all know most people aren&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to do what we do, so I thought that was a wonderful attitude this<br/>\nwoman had.<br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLaurel A.
