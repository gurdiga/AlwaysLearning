I can&#39;t afford to buy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;everything they say they have to have at the grocery store and I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;like to put some of the money into good food.  At home, when they want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;food that needs to be prepared, do you just drop whatever your doing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;rush into the kitchen to make what they want?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Good questions!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes they&#39;d probably go through a transition period where they test the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;limits - just to figure out where those limits went. Be ready for them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to eat nothing but cheetos for a few days, maybe. It is okay to gently<br/>\n&gt; &gt;point out that they might not be feeling really well - if they do stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;themselves.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I comment.  I mean - my kids expect me to give them information and if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they are filling up on tortilla chips and I think they might not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;realize that they have almost no protein and that maybe they need some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;protein, they&#39;ll hear from me. Not in a restrictive shaming way - but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in a, &quot;Do you want an egg salad sandwich or maybe just a hardboiled egg<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to go with that? You can probably use the protein.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Budget is always a factor. I can&#39;t get the kids everything they want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all the time. BUT - be sure it really is that. If a kid is asking for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bag of chips at the checkstand, something that costs under a dollar, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doubt it is really budget that prevents you from buying it. But - just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like with everything else, you have little kids and you can ask: &quot;Would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you rather have a peach pie or popsicles?&quot; No reason not to just say<br/>\n&gt; &gt;straight out that you don&#39;t feel like you can afford both. You probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also couldn&#39;t afford both artichokes AND asparagus in the same shopping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trip.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With little kids like yours, I think you&#39;re going to do  a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dropping what you&#39;re doing and preparing food, yes. But - you can also<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have stuff chopped up and ready and just say that that is there if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can&#39;t wait.  There are so many easy finger foods - not having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a short-order cook every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;minute of the day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I remember that for a while I used to put all kinds of things in little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;baggies in the morning - those snack size baggies. A few pitted dates,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some raisins, some peanut butter crackers, cheerios, little cheese<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chunks, etc. All KINDS of things. They were in the refrigerator - even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the things that didn&#39;t need refrigeration, in a big bowl - and the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt;could just grab a baggie anytime and there was a little snack. I kept<br/>\n&gt; &gt;baggies of frozen grapes in the freezer during the summer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Not having restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t actually have a fairly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;large amount of control when the kids are little like yours. It means<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you don&#39;t dole out cookies, though, saying, &quot;Here are you two cookies<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for the day and don&#39;t ask for more because you KNOW you&#39;re only allowed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;two cookies per day.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The only time things get &quot;doled out&quot; like that around here is when we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;need to make sure some gets saved for somebody who isn&#39;t home but we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know will really like it. Then we divvy it up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My daughter&#39;s girl scout leader doles out snack in a really restrictive<br/>\n&gt; &gt;way. Last week the person bringing snack brought a package of cookies<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and some pretzels. The leader put them out and said the girls could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have all the pretzels they wanted but only two cookies per girl. That<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only used up about 1/4 of the cookies in the package, but when girls<br/>\n&gt; &gt;went back for more she very sharply said, &quot;Two cookies is enough for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you.&quot; (She&#39;s very nice - i don&#39;t mean she said it meanly - but very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;strongly.) Her daughter asks for food ALL the time. We were at a girl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;scout event and she wanted stuff from the snack bar - just candy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chips, etc. My daughter wasn&#39;t hungry because she&#39;d eaten a tangerine,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a cheese sandwich, half a cucumber, and some carrots. Yesterday at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stables there were cans of soda in the refrigerator and my daughter got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off her horse and was really hot and thirsty - I offered her the soda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but she turned it down and said she needed water. The soda and junk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;food don&#39;t hold any special attraction for her at all - she evaluates<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whether she feels like having it based on whether she really FEELS like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;having it. There are no other deeper motives, no extra feelings - she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than if she feels like having an apple.  I&#39;m amazed and happy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-pam<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!

Maybe not so smooth, but effective.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: BADOLBILZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 6:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] when parents disagree<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m picturing a meal at my parents or in-laws where there&#39;s no dessert <br/>\nif you don&#39;t eat all your dinner.

In one case, Dagny was visiting at my<br/>\nsister&#39;s house.  When she got hungry she asked for some food and was<br/>\ntold that it was not snack time.  At their house they eat at certain<br/>\ntimes of the day and that&#39;s it.  She came home pretty confused about why<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t just eat if they were hungry.  I think she was about four.<br/>\nWe talked about what we could do about it, and the next time she went<br/>\nfor a sleepover I told my sister that it was important to me that Dagny<br/>\neat when she was hungry, and we&#39;d be happy to pack some snacks.

Then we divvy it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My daughter&#39;s girl scout leader doles out snack in a really restrictive <br/>\n&gt;way. Last week the person bringing snack brought a package of cookies <br/>\n&gt;and some pretzels. The leader put them out and said the girls could <br/>\n&gt;have all the pretzels they wanted but only two cookies per girl. That <br/>\n&gt;only used up about 1/4 of the cookies in the package, but when girls <br/>\n&gt;went back for more she very sharply said, &quot;Two cookies is enough for <br/>\n&gt;you.&quot; (She&#39;s very nice - i don&#39;t mean she said it meanly - but very <br/>\n&gt;strongly.) Her daughter asks for food ALL the time. We were at a girl <br/>\n&gt;scout event and she wanted stuff from the snack bar - just candy, <br/>\n&gt;chips, etc. My daughter wasn&#39;t hungry because she&#39;d eaten a tangerine, <br/>\n&gt;a cheese sandwich, half a cucumber, and some carrots. Yesterday at the <br/>\n&gt;stables there were cans of soda in the refrigerator and my daughter got <br/>\n&gt;off her horse and was really hot and thirsty - I offered her the soda <br/>\n&gt;but she turned it down and said she needed water. The soda and junk <br/>\n&gt;food don&#39;t hold any special attraction for her at all - she evaluates <br/>\n&gt;whether she feels like having it based on whether she really FEELS like <br/>\n&gt;having it. There are no other deeper motives, no extra feelings - she <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different <br/>\n&gt;than if she feels like having an apple.

We were at a girl <br/>\nscout event and she wanted stuff from the snack bar - just candy, <br/>\nchips, etc. My daughter wasn&#39;t hungry because she&#39;d eaten a tangerine, <br/>\na cheese sandwich, half a cucumber, and some carrots. Yesterday at the <br/>\nstables there were cans of soda in the refrigerator and my daughter got <br/>\noff her horse and was really hot and thirsty - I offered her the soda <br/>\nbut she turned it down and said she needed water. The soda and junk <br/>\nfood don&#39;t hold any special attraction for her at all - she evaluates <br/>\nwhether she feels like having it based on whether she really FEELS like <br/>\nhaving it. There are no other deeper motives, no extra feelings - she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different <br/>\nthan if she feels like having an apple.

The case against controlling what<br/>\nyour children eat - The pediatrician&#39;s guide to safe and healthy food and<br/>\ngrowth_   I&#39;ve pretty much allowed my kids to eat the way they learn.  My<br/>\nson, now 13, eats &quot;beige.&quot;  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever eaten a vegetable.  He&#39;s<br/>\ntaller than I am now, about 5&#39;4&quot;+, and 122 lbs.  According to the growth<br/>\ncharts, he&#39;s holding steady at the 95th percentile, pretty much where he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen since birth.  My daughter, currently 15, eats a somewhat more varied<br/>\ndiet, and, at 5&#39;3&quot; and 108, holds steady near the 25th percentile.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy very cool pediatrician told me, back when Laura was a toddler, that, if<br/>\nit made ME feel better, I could slip some spinach into a lasagna once in<br/>\nawhile, but a big battle over food would create more problems than not<br/>\neating veggies.  I, of course, hate vegetable lasagna and never make any<br/>\nkind but the meaty Stouffers anyway &lt;g&gt;  My dh doesn&#39;t like fruit except<br/>\napples and oranges, I dislike almost all cooked green vegetables and so<br/>\nnever serve them.  We&#39;re all average weight, no health problems, rarely get<br/>\nsick, never take vitamins, eat ice cream nearly every day...  So far, they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t chosen to learn much in the way of math, either, but we now have 22<br/>\npets &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our family, food just isn&#39;t very important.  We eat what we like, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t think about food much, and no one really likes to cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] when parents disagree","postDate":"1049828244","msgId":13348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOS4yMWE1NzVmMS4yYmM0NzU5NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13347,"nextInTopic":13350,"prevInTime":13347,"nextInTime":13349,"topicId":13332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/8/03 12:15:52 PM, ynxn96@frontiernet.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-154538339\">In a message dated 4/8/03 12:15:52 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Are we supposed to go through a <br/>\ntransitional period where the girls can eat whatever they want with no <br/>\ncomment from me?

She&#39;d <br/>\nrather nibble on a bag of lettuce than a bag of chips almost any time. <br/>\nWe&#39;ll stop at a coffeeshop for desert - everyone else will order pie or <br/>\ncheesecake and she&#39;ll order a small dinner salad. And -she doesn&#39;t soak <br/>\nit in dressing either - it is the lettuce and cucumbers she likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 yo will always order cheesecake. Often would ask for a chicken <br/>\nfried steak and gravy to go along with it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 18 yo will go for chips every time. When she goes to the grocery <br/>\nstore, that&#39;s what she comes home with - bags of tortilla chips. Nobody <br/>\nelse usually touches them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that their eating interests are REALLY different - raised <br/>\nin the same house with no food restrictions and they are not all <br/>\nequally healthy in their choices. Sometimes it sounds like people here <br/>\nthink that kids left on their own will always make only perfectly <br/>\nhealthy food choices, but that isn&#39;t my observation for most kids. So - <br/>\nif a parent wants them to ONLY eat healthy foods -no sweets, no high <br/>\nfat foods, no salty snacks, then I think you&#39;d have to restrict what is <br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat IS true, though, is that kids won&#39;t ONLY eat those less nutritious <br/>\nfoods....given freedom to choose -  they will also eat lots of good <br/>\nhealthy foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people say they gave their kids freedom to choose and it didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork - I think maybe their expectations are too high - they think the <br/>\nkids are going to pass up the cookies, candy, salty snacks, and sodas <br/>\nall the time - always choosing the spinach and broccoli instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will. My 12 yo eats incredibly healthy - really always <br/>\nchooses fruits and vegetables over anything else.
