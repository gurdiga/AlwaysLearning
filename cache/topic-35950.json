DH and youngest don&#39;t seem to have  that <br/>\nproblem (in fact, DH can fall asleep in moments just about anywhere-even  <br/>\nstanding up!). I seem to have hit upon a solution that works for us: repetitive,  <br/>\nboring hand-held video games. T.V. nor reading work for me-in fact, they wake <br/>\nme  up. But something about a game where you have to work a long time to build  <br/>\nexperience points to move on, or something I&#39;m so familiar with (from <br/>\nchildhood,  even) like Monopoly seems to occupy my mind *just enough* to keep those <br/>\nthoughts  from racing around in my head, but doesn&#39;t engage it enough to merit <br/>\ncontinued  altertness. I&#39;ve gone from 1-2 hours of time to fall asleep to <br/>\n10-30 minutes!!  Wyl (9), hasn&#39;t seemed to find a game that does that for him, <br/>\nyet, and many  games wake him. But we&#39;re working on that.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Gas prices getting you down? Search AOL Autos for <br/>\nfuel-efficient used cars.
