Yes, I see it as a rushing river too. There is much hope and we can help spread the waters a little further by living the unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found myself enter into a debate yesterday at the store. I live in a small town where EVERYONE notices our strange way of living. I get asked often when my kids will go to school and get pitying looks when I tell them they won&#39;t be going. I&#39;ve gotten better over time at either ending the conversation quickly, or vaguely answering questions about our life.<br/>\n<br/>\n But yesterday I was feeling a little squirrely and let loose some bold statements explaining my decision to &quot;homeschool&quot; (knowing that unschooling was impossible to explain in this setting). It ended with the woman (in her 40&#39;s) feeling sad because she had always wanted to graduate from high school and never did and how tragic that I was depriving my children of that opportuntity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to help spread the good news about unschooling. But what happened yesterday at the store is not the way to do it. These forums are the way to do it. Writing and reading books is the way to do it. Building relationships with others who are interested or already practicing these concepts is the way to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador<br/>\nDivina 5.5<br/>\nSabina almost 4!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;m Bored","postDate":"1238875544","msgId":43746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERFRjZCNTcyLUZCRTQtNDNDQi1BMjQ4LTA4REY3RTM5NEI5REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyODYxbys5aHZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdyODYxbys5aHZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43736,"nextInTopic":43823,"prevInTime":43745,"nextInTime":43747,"topicId":18654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I also thought of how the unschooling puddle is moving all across the states with each reading, sharing, or speaking-=- Thank you very much for the kind","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-635790420\">-=-I also thought of how the unschooling puddle is moving all across  <br/>\nthe states with each reading, sharing, or speaking-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much for the kind words.<br/>\nThe book is on beyond the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are copies in Canada, Australia, one in New Zealand (maybe two),  <br/>\none in South Africa, two in France, several in the U.K. and maybe some  <br/>\nothers I&#39;ve forgotten.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286757822,"authorName":"emsimmom","from":"&quot;emsimmom&quot; &lt;emsimmom@...&gt;","profile":"emsimmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"I&#39;m Bored","postDate":"1238866808","msgId":43736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyODYxbys5aHZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18676,"nextInTopic":43746,"prevInTime":43735,"nextInTime":43737,"topicId":18654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!
