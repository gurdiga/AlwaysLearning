Eg)===<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 8 and he actually really enjoys our Playstation 2.  You can buy them relatively cheap from a pawn shop, flea market, or yard sale, and you can find the games everywhere for a decent price.  My son is really enjoying the skateboarding games (mostly Tony Hawk ones) right now.  We find the games at yard sales and flea markets for $2-$7.  Even though it&#39;s not the most advanced system out there, he likes it because we have it set up in his room on a small TV so he doesn&#39;t have to worry about anyone else watching a show when he wants to play.  Plus the PS2 plays DVDs, so he can watch those in his room as well with this set up.  We like the PS2 because when he is ready for a new game, it doesn&#39;t cost us much to help him with that. <br/>\n<br/>\n===Or any Apps that they like particularly, too.===<br/>\nMy son enjoys Cut the Rope, Angry Birds (not the space version), and Where&#39;s My Water.  Angry Birds has been his favorite for a few years though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ma hoping others will chime in with apps too, I am always on the look out for a fun new one.
