The first crash was in Alaska a <br/>\ncouple of years ago. Chris had an older station wagon, nothing fancy. <br/>\nJody borrowed it to go blueberry picking up in the mountains, lost <br/>\nthe brakes on a curve and almost took the car off a several-hundred <br/>\nfoot cliff. She managed to sideswipe it into a bank and get it <br/>\nstopped, but totalled the car in the process. When we went back up to <br/>\nget the car and I saw the tracks showing how she&#39;d come within 10&#39; of <br/>\ngoing over I just sat down in the middle of the road and cried, <br/>\nhugging her. Chris didn&#39;t say much that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time it was his pride and joy - a &#39;66 Mustang. She ran a stop <br/>\nsign and smacked into an Oldsmobile. Nobody got hurt but the Mustang <br/>\nwas totalled. Christopher was just happy that Jody and his buddy who <br/>\nwere riding with her weren&#39;t hurt. His only comment that time was <br/>\n&quot;When she wrecks them she sure does a thorough job...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(This is a tall, mostly quiet kid, with a very dry sense of humor...)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer she was driving his Toyota 4-Runner and backed into a <br/>\nlightpost, significantly damaging the read end (broke the rear <br/>\nwindow). When Chris found out about this relatively minor incident <br/>\n(relative to the two totallings) he made up for lost time, and really <br/>\ntook her to task about driving responsibly, making good on one&#39;s <br/>\ndebts (she hadn&#39;t paid him much on the other two, mostly &#39;cuz she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t worked), and various other well-founded grievances. And told <br/>\nher it would be a cold day in hell before she drove another one of <br/>\nhis cars.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was good for his word on that last score. Last August the two of <br/>\nthem drove his &#39;68 Mustang to Alaska and he never let her behind the <br/>\nwheel once on the entire 2,800 mile trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What do you think allowed that? Did you stay out of<br/>\n&gt;the discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Just like I&#39;d stay out of the discussion if it involved two <br/>\nfriends of mine. It was their concern, not mine. We raised these kids <br/>\nto deal with each other, and not through us as mediators, except when <br/>\nabsolutely necessary. They&#39;ve all learned to trust and respect each <br/>\nother, and have all said they&#39;re each others&#39; best friends many <br/>\ntimes. It probably helps that we&#39;ve always done a lot together as a <br/>\nfamily, and the kids still go sailing, riding, partying, snowboarding <br/>\nand travelling together. Last fall the three youngest (Chris and Jody <br/>\nand the youngest, Michael, 15) organized a backpacking trip into a <br/>\nhuge wilderness area in the Cascade Mountains. They invited a dozen <br/>\nfriends and the group spent 8 days living on pancakes and fish and <br/>\nberries and each others&#39; good company. It was one of the highlights <br/>\nof everyone&#39;s year!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Was struggling - Now Unschooling?","postDate":"1007922460","msgId":382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwYy45ZGE1MzNjLjI5NDUwNzFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":379,"nextInTopic":384,"prevInTime":381,"nextInTime":383,"topicId":356,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"   neener . ...
