I haven&#39;t posted much but have been reading alot. I just <br/>\nwanted to write a thank you to all of you out there that are part of <br/>\nthis way of life and for contributing to those of us who are new to <br/>\nthe journey and need the support , encouragement and guidance.<br/>\nWe have been unschooling for about a year now with a few bumps in <br/>\nthe road. But I have to say we love it! My children are 6, 4, 2 and <br/>\n8 months old and since we have let go of the old parenting mindsets <br/>\nthey have been so much more happier and loving. <br/>\nWhat really helped us was reading the articles from joyfully <br/>\nrejoicing. And really grasping the idea that we are partners in life <br/>\nwith our children. Also understanding how difficult and stressful it <br/>\nis for a child that doesnt have many choices. We have changed the <br/>\nway we see our children and realizing that they need us to give them <br/>\nthe information they need to understand things instead of forcing <br/>\nthem to comform to what we think is right. We have totally changed <br/>\nthe way we speak to them for ex: When my oldest takes a toy from the <br/>\ntoddler I used to bark at him to give it back and sometimes he would <br/>\nget a time out. But now I just calmly let him know that taking other <br/>\npeoples toys is rude and hurts their feelings. And he responds in <br/>\nsuch a nicer more loving way, like he is understanding how his <br/>\nactions affect others. He went from a very angry child who screamed <br/>\nalot and hit to a loving, calm and gentle boy in what seemed <br/>\novernight.<br/>\nSo that is just some if the things that have been going on with us <br/>\nlately.<br/>\nAnd to answer that other question as to whether or not our children <br/>\ntake interest in anything, I can say that mine do. My oldest son is <br/>\nvery interested in everything science. Astronomy, engineering, <br/>\nconstruction, rocketry, nature and carries around books studying it <br/>\non his own quite often.<br/>\nMy daughter loves art and spends alot of time drawing , painting and <br/>\ncoloring and helps me alot around the house, so I can say she is <br/>\ninterested in homemaking. She also shows interest in gardening and <br/>\ncomposting. She pretty much follows me around all day wanting to be <br/>\ninvolved in whatever I am doing-which I absolutely cherish.<br/>\nMy toddler is busy being a toddler and learning about the world <br/>\naround him as is my baby.<br/>\nI just wanted to say thank you-especially to Sandra Dodd, your <br/>\nwebsites and articles have helped us tremendously. And we plan on <br/>\ngoing to the Rethinking education conference so hopefully we will <br/>\nsee some of you there!<br/>\nOne Love-Tna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28824,"nextTopicId":28832}}
