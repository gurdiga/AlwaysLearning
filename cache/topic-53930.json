It felt like you were really trying hard to put me in <br/>\na fascist concpiracy theoritics corner.<br/>\nWith the type of community college you described we are not to far from <br/>\none another :)<br/>\nYou asked, what&#39;s the force&#39;s goal. I think the goal of &quot;the force&quot; is <br/>\nto conserve existing structures. And this is not one &quot;club&quot; like the <br/>\nilluminati or so, but a sociological trend. Big systems organize around <br/>\neach other and reinforce each other. So if one of the big systems <br/>\nchanges to much and to fast, the other systems may crumble. E.g. public <br/>\nhealth couldn&#39;t work like it does now, if you abolish schools tomorrow - <br/>\nbecause they are interconnected. Additionally you have customs and <br/>\ntradition and the like, that &quot;indoctrinate&quot; you (you have to read the <br/>\nindoctrinate like in Monroe-Doctrine) .<br/>\nBut if they change slowly, then they can mutually adapt. Taking schools <br/>\nof the table was (as far as I know) first thougt of by Buckminster <br/>\nFuller in the 1960s and since then more and more are sharing that goal. <br/>\nAnd it is evolving quite fast in the USA - as far as I see. But it could <br/>\nbe a bit faster, if parents would get the same funding and support for <br/>\nhaving their children in as outside of school. I think as soon as the <br/>\nschoolfree movement will grow above 5% or 6% they can claim equal <br/>\nfunding and then politicians will be very aware of that claim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from platons fascist dreams to nowadays mass indoctrination.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who&#39;s platon?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Plato was an old greek philosopher, who examined the spartan school <br/>\nsystem and constructed it as the basis of a philosophers state which <br/>\nshould follow the instable democracy (in those days democracy tumbled <br/>\ninto tyranny every few decades). He is one of the most influential <br/>\npolitical thinkers and lot of politician scientists will tell you that <br/>\nall political science is just a footnote to plato.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And it sounds like you want to mass indoctrinate everyone into<br/>\n&gt; believing schools are bad. You want to yank schools away from people<br/>\n&gt; who are freely choosing them. Sounds like a fascist dream to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I meet someone who is *freely* choosing school, then he/she shall <br/>\nhave it, anything else would be fascist. But we have to stand up for the <br/>\nfree choice - as explained above.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that clarifies what I meant and takes the radical edge out of our <br/>\nmisunderstanding (as far as it was one).<br/>\n<br/>\nCordialement<br/>\nRichard</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: John Taylor Gatto","postDate":"1273498649","msgId":54004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGMDhCNUNBMDMyQjRFOEU4NEQ3MTkyOUFGODNFQUUxQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzOTE2aStxOXFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhzOTE2aStxOXFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54003,"nextInTopic":54005,"prevInTime":54003,"nextInTime":54005,"topicId":53930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

However, I do think that public education and economics are so entwined that it will be extremely difficult to separate the two for many many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, I listened to a conversation in which Dr. Gabor Mate (who is supportive of attachment parenting and helped Gordon Neufeld write his book, &quot;Hold On To Your Kids: Why Parents Matter&quot;) discussed full-day and early Kindergarten programs (for 3 & 4 year olds) with  an policy advisor in Ontario and an academic who has studied ECE in Canada. Ontario and BC are implementing additional Kindergarten programs starting this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe podcast of the interview has been taken down from the CBC site, but what stuck out in my mind was that one of the &quot;experts&quot; in favour of full-day kindergarten (a professor of sociology at the University of Manitoba) was quick to say that it more than paid for itself (something like 1.5x) as it meant that mothers returned to the work force earlier. This person&#39;s opinion has certainly informed public policy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this blurb, although the link to the podcast was down:<br/>\n&quot;The province of Ontario is planning to launch a full-day, fully funded child-care and kindergarten program in the fall of 2010. Advocates of early childhood education say the program is long overdue and promises huge payoffs -- that children who attend all day kindergarten will be more likely to get a post-secondary education and have higher earning potential, in addition to being less likely to fall into crime.&quot; I recall that Dr. Mate urged the policy makers to look at the statistics for Sweden (more about Sweden here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stratletter.com/dec10speech.html)\">http://www.stratletter.com/dec10speech.html)</a> as what&#39;s happening in that country, as a result of a state-funded early childhood program, does not support those supposed long term payoffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who is into social ecology who sees homeschooling as elitist (only for those who can afford to do it). I don&#39;t agree with him as I&#39;ve seen parents from all sorts of socioeconomic backgrounds successfully homeschooling their kids, but I can understand why many people don&#39;t think they can &quot;afford&quot; to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: John Taylor Gatto","postDate":"1273496668","msgId":53999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4M0FGNjlEN0NGQzRFNjE4NUM4MTQ0MEYwOTM0ODcyQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQwMDk2RUVBLUREQjgtNEI5QS1BOTk3LUVBMjAwRjlEMDYxQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhzN2RvNCtkZjVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEJFN0JENjcuODA1MDAwMUBnbXguZGU+IDxEMDA5NkVFQS1EREI4LTRCOUEtQTk5Ny1FQTIwMEY5RDA2MUNAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":53998,"nextInTopic":54000,"prevInTime":53998,"nextInTime":54000,"topicId":53930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"+++And it sounds like you want to mass indoctrinate everyone into believing schools are bad.

Does he think 5 year olds can stay home by themselves or with siblings?  If he&#39;s expecting people to work together with their neighbors and communities, he&#39;s just living in some fantasy world because that is not going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe towns around me compete against each other for school enrollment.  One town started all day every day kindergarten last year (instead of half day or 3 days a week) and got 5 kids from a neighboring town.  5 kids is a lot around here.  :)  Now THAT town announced it&#39;s going to all day every day kindergarten.  I&#39;m not sure all day every day kindergarten isn&#39;t better than half day or 3 days a week.  Maybe at least with all day every day kindergarten, their parents make an effort to pick them up straight from school (or from the bus...  or BE THERE when they walk home from the bus...) rather than wait until 5 or 5:30 to pick them up from daycare that they get bussed to mid-day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-emiLy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 8, 2010, at 8:16 PM, alexandriapalonia wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is it?<br/>\n&gt; He argues after about 4 it really isn&#39;t necessary, and he makes a pretty strong case for undoing the infantilization of our society.<br/>\n&gt; Andrea<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the thing, though.
