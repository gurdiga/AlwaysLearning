My 3yo is very easily frustrated and prone to screaming,<br/>\nflopping fits.  If we attempt to console him, it makes matters worse.

I like to brainstorm with others potential <br/>\nsolutions to our current dilemnas. When I get the feeling that being home <br/>\nwith the kids is not working because they fight, or they scream they can&#39;t <br/>\ndo this and that, I&#39;m realizing this is the difficult part of finding the <br/>\nflow of learning together. Both hubby and I are frustrated with the constant <br/>\nand I mean constant need for one of the kids to need us. Maybe this all <br/>\nstems way back to our finding out I was expecting again. Our third was not <br/>\nin our future plans. She is here and beautiful, a two year old full of life. <br/>\nWe also take care of Tim&#39;s dad who lives a few blocks away in a rest home. <br/>\nSo people are saying they will do these things for themselves when they are <br/>\nready. Tim and I seem to be ready for them to do simple tasks like putting <br/>\non pjs. I am all for doing it with them. When hubby complains he can not <br/>\nhelp them get into bed because the way I always do it for them, then he and <br/>\nI become engaged in a who is right here moment. I guess I need to also vent <br/>\nthe frustration of two people parenting together. Thanks again for <br/>\nlistening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone talked about their son and sports. My son will fall apart because he <br/>\nsenses he is not capable. I do not see us modeling perfection. I am the <br/>\nqueen of not correcting or teaching. We have a coach man on the block. No <br/>\nkid ever plays with him because he is always correcting and seeking <br/>\nperfection, ie taeching. I play, their level. We mix things up, hit a <br/>\nsoccerball with the bat, free form. My kids tend to fall apart from their <br/>\nown expectation of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see some patterns I set up for frustration, who said to be proactive. <br/>\nMy little guy saw his sister able to work the sticks onto the can. That was <br/>\nhis expectation for himself. And he did not want me to do parts. That is <br/>\nwhen I get frustrated. My daughter saw me making hearts. I did show her the <br/>\n3 that I could not do, but she wanted them to work like mine on her first <br/>\ntry.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I do enjoy the opportunity to be with my kids. I would not <br/>\ntrade my life for anything. My kids are special, unique, shining spirits in <br/>\nour world. We do have a great existence. I ask behavior questions because <br/>\nthis is the only area that grates me. How they treat eachother and <br/>\nthemselves. When they get so frustrated they abandon things in a huff, I <br/>\nworry for their emotional wellbeing. When they fight, I worry too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to you all soon,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Frustrated Kids","postDate":"1014327836","msgId":5074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Yy45NDZkOTdlLjI5YTZjNDFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5075,"prevInTime":5073,"nextInTime":5075,"topicId":5074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 02/21/2002 12:52:03 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
