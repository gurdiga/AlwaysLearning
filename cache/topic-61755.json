And while many parents would seek to tamp down such expression out of<br/>\nfear for their child&#39;s safety -- or even outrage at his or her defiance of<br/>\nhow boys and girls &quot;ought to be&quot; -- I have a very different response. I<br/>\nargue that parents should encourage their children to express themselves as<br/>\nthey want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the head of Gender Spectrum &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.genderspectrum.org/\">http://www.genderspectrum.org/</a>&gt;, a San<br/>\nFrancisco-based organization for families of boys and girls who don&#39;t<br/>\nconform to conventional gender stereotypes. I know that not every little<br/>\ngirl wants to be a princess, nor does every boy want to be a cowboy or<br/>\nsuperhero. Yet for far too long, society&#39;s response to these children has<br/>\nbeen either silence or mockery. It is time for this to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile society has changed a great deal over the last few decades, the notion<br/>\nof rigid gender roles continues to thrive in ways that play no small part in<br/>\nour children&#39;s upbringing. As parents, we instruct gender, but so too do the<br/>\nmedia, schools, and religious institutions. Gender roles and expectations<br/>\nbecome intricately woven into the fabric of our beings without our even<br/>\nrealizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough my work over the past two decades with parents, I have found that it<br/>\ncan consequently be incredibly hard for parents to simply allow their<br/>\nchildren to express themselves. But this is only even an issue because many<br/>\nof the things children naturally want to do, and the ways children naturally<br/>\nwant to express themselves have had a stamp of gender added to them.<br/>\nHairstyles, toys, and clothing preferences have no innate gender, yet few of<br/>\nus hesitate to attach a gender to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI argue that our basic values as parents should not change simply because we<br/>\nare thinking about our sons rather than our daughters, or vice versa. The<br/>\nimportant question isn&#39;t whether this style of dress, toy, or nail polish is<br/>\nappropriate for a son or daughter; it&#39;s whether it&#39;s appropriate for a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things are not expressions of gender -- they are natural expressions<br/>\nof self. If we simply love and support our children equally, without judging<br/>\ntheir expression based on their gender, we are then free to focus on<br/>\ninstilling the values that are really important to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tell our kids to be who they are and unashamed of their differences. Yet<br/>\nwhen it comes to gender expression, we still struggle. We think: Should I<br/>\nallow my child to cross this line? Where is the line, anyway? What will the<br/>\nneighbors, teachers, and grandparents think? Won&#39;t I be setting him up for<br/>\nteasing? Won&#39;t I be encouraging him to be gay?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want our children to be appreciated and accepted, but we parents also<br/>\nwant to be approved of and accepted. This creates a sad double standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is normal to feel that social change takes away our sense of security.<br/>\nEach generation has these struggles with their children. But it is a natural<br/>\npart of social growth. It is time to let go. When a child spends his or her<br/>\ntime regulating the mannerisms he or she adopts, or what he or she wears or<br/>\nplays, it detracts from the same energy that children can put towards<br/>\nlearning and creative or athletic expression.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we allow our children to throw off sexist notions of self-expression,<br/>\nwhile still keeping them safe? My answer is clear: Colors are colors, toys<br/>\nare toys, clothes are clothes, and hair is hair. Each person is entitled to<br/>\nexpress his or individuality and personal preferences to the extent that it<br/>\ndoes not hurt anyone else. We do not disrespect others, we honor everyone&#39;s<br/>\nchoice to express themselves, and we self-correct if we lapse into judgment<br/>\nourselves. It is up to us, to each family, to instill these values for the<br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually important is that the same values are reinforced at school. At<br/>\nGender Spectrum, we have worked with countless children in their classrooms,<br/>\nand can vouch that children are ready for these changes. Education merely<br/>\nrequires age-appropriate discussion of matters such as how some girls prefer<br/>\nshort hair and some boys want to play with dolls. There is no agenda other<br/>\nthan understanding and acceptance. Kids of all ages are receptive to and<br/>\nready for these conversations. From there, our guidelines are simple: If we<br/>\nhonor and respect one another, we can all get along.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more parents are living these guidelines every day. At the end of<br/>\nJuly, Gender Spectrum will hold its annual Family Conference, which will<br/>\nbring hundreds of gender-nonconforming children and teenagers, their<br/>\nfamilies, and allies together. For a few days, they will have the<br/>\nopportunity to see that they are not alone, to learn from each other, and to<br/>\nattend a wide range of programming on the different facets of the<br/>\ngender-nonconforming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course, it all begins at home. Should you allow your son to wear nail<br/>\npolish out of the house? If he likes it, why not? Wearing nail polish will<br/>\nnot make him gay; it will not make him transgender. It just may make him<br/>\nhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":350924989,"authorName":"Christina Cat","from":"Christina Cat &lt;tinawindcat@...&gt;","profile":"tinawind","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sibling conflict and gender identification questions","postDate":"1310983419","msgId":61838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSkN2a1NVdTlKcXBiTm5jK3VIQTdVekROVHNuVnFBR0xBNmRndHNLU0grZkU1S1h0QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl1OTIxMis1bDdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl1OTIxMis1bDdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61784,"nextInTopic":61839,"prevInTime":61837,"nextInTime":61839,"topicId":61755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sun, Jun 26, 2011 at 9:47 PM, lidjalynne05 ...

My son is 2, my daughter is 3.<br/>\n&gt; -----------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me start by saying I&#39;m new to Unschooling, but I have an almost 5 year old and 2 year old daughters. When DD1 was around 3.5, the physical conflicts between my two were their worst. DD1 had been pretty sweet and affectionate towards her infant sister but somewhere around age 3.5, DD1 seemed to become more brittle emotionally and started to intentionally hurt DD2.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had a difficult time learning to control my rage when I could see DD1 calculate something like rolling the closet door over her little sister&#39;s foot intentionally. What I knew to do, but found challenging to do instinctively and consistently until more recently -- breathe, stay calm, act fast to create a barrier between the two -- preferable to removing one of the children and to use one word of what you are trying to bring into the situation...like &quot;safety&quot;. While I check first to see if the &quot;victim&quot; is ok, I try to show concern in proportion to the seriousness of the situation. A cut or bruise gets immediate, individualized attention, though I might invite the other to help if the &quot;victim&quot; were willing with a bandage or ice, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Something that makes complete sense to me now, but only used to make sense in my brain -- is that the one who is doing the hurting is often the one who actually was hurting inside first and likely needs extra TLC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, my almost 5 year old and 2 were fighting over who could watch their show first (only one TV with a DVR and DVD player) and DD1 tried to poke out DD2&#39;s eye. I was sitting right there next to them so i brought them both on to my lap and talked briefly and simply in a soothing-type voice, &quot;Hey guys, we all need safety in our home, right?&quot;. And then, &quot;It&#39;s hard to share sometimes, but did you know that you both came from the same room? It&#39;s called a &#39;womb&#39;! A womb-room that you were both in when you were in Mama&#39;s belly before you came here! Can you believe you shared that?&quot; All this while being as sweet and calm and loving as possible, snuggling my little girls.

Over the fall/winter, pink became his favorite color.  He often pulled out his sisters pink dress with pink and purple hearts on it and joyfully wore it to homeschool group, the library, the grocery store, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was greatful that the longer length of the dress kept him a little warmer than a regular sized long sleeved shirt.  Plus, the dress wasn&#39;t bulky like most sweaters are.  And he was happy to be wearing what he picked out by himself.  Sure, I could have insisted that he put on a sweater or long jacket - maybe a spiderman one or another boyish dark color or generic color, but he was happy wearing what he wanted to wear and I didn&#39;t mind.  It feel glad that letting him pick out a favorite article of clothing can make him feel pleased - that is such a simple, small and easy thing I can do that brings him happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, I was shopping for sneakers at JC Penny&#39;s for my daughter and she found a cool pair of light up sparkly sneakers.  My son found and tried on a pair of pink velcro sneakers.  Easy to get on/off and his favorite color.  Because he liked them, I bought them for him.  He still wears them almost every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe sometimes wears my daughters old pink swim diaper too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople may have thought he was a girl unless they knew him because he had curlish longish hair.  His hair is now short, although when he wears even just the pink sneakers, people sometimes assume he is a girl.  Sometimes I correct them, sometimes I let it go.  If they say something or seemed surprised when I tell them he is a boy who loves to wear pink or a dress, I may lightheartedly add that it doesn&#39;t matter to me if he wears a dress or not as a young child, and that if he wanted to wear them when he&#39;s ten, I&#39;d still love him!  And by that age he&#39;d know that he might expect some comments, etc from others and the culture in general.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first and my third children are girls.  My second and fourth children are boys.  I did notice that each of the kids went through a phase where they wanted to wear or do what the next oldest did.  My second son liked to wear a dress and play dress up with his sister for a while.  Eventually he got into Spiderman and the Hulk, etc.  To me and for the culture in which we live and with consideration to whom we associate with, I feel comfortable letting my two year old child pick out what he wants to wear, even if it isn&#39;t the accepted norm.  I would rather support my child&#39;s preferences and choices and deal with a few explanations or whatever criticism&#39;s might be said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have no one in our family that I know of who would physically hurt my son for wearing a dress or pink.  If I ever thought they would, I would stay the heck away from them as that kind of a person would not be the kind of person I would consider safe for me or my kids to be around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie (mom to Katie, 13, Li 9, Makana 6, and Kanoa 2)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sibling conflict and gender identification questions","postDate":"1309232042","msgId":61766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFOTBBQUQzLTdGN0EtNDhFRS1CRTk2LTQ3NzU5MDIyNzNBNkB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGl1OTIxMis1bDdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl1OTIxMis1bDdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61765,"nextInTopic":61767,"prevInTime":61765,"nextInTime":61767,"topicId":61755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When DD1 was around 3.5, the physical conflicts between my two were their worst.  DD1 had been pretty sweet and affectionate towards her infant sister but somewhere around age 3.5, DD1 seemed to become more brittle emotionally and started to intentionally hurt DD2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a difficult time learning to control my rage when I could see DD1 calculate something like rolling the closet door over her little sister&#39;s foot intentionally.  What I knew to do, but found challenging to do instinctively and consistently until more recently -- breathe, stay calm, act fast to create a barrier between the two -- preferable to removing one of the children and to use one word of what you are trying to bring into the situation...like &quot;safety&quot;.  While I check first to see if the &quot;victim&quot; is ok, I try to show concern in proportion to the seriousness of the situation.  A cut or bruise gets immediate, individualized attention, though I might invite the other to help if the &quot;victim&quot; were willing with a bandage or ice, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that makes complete sense to me now, but only used to make sense in my brain -- is that the one who is doing the hurting is often the one who actually was hurting inside first and likely needs extra TLC.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my almost 5 year old and 2 were fighting over who could watch their show first (only one TV with a DVR and DVD player) and DD1 tried to poke out DD2&#39;s eye.  I was sitting right there next to them so i brought them both on to my lap and talked briefly and simply in a soothing-type voice, &quot;Hey guys, we all need safety in our home, right?&quot;.  And then, &quot;It&#39;s hard to share sometimes, but did you know that you both came from the same room?  It&#39;s called a &#39;womb&#39;!  A womb-room that you were both in when you were in Mama&#39;s belly before you came here!  Can you believe you shared that?&quot;  All this while being as sweet and calm and loving as possible, snuggling my little girls.

Our homeschooling <br/>\ncommunity was very supportive, understanding that the boys were young and <br/>\ntreated the dresses as a clothing choice. They likely would have been supportive <br/>\nif the boys were older, too. Often parents of school children or parents not <br/>\ninvolved in our natural parenting and homeschooling group would give odd looks, <br/>\nbut the boys rarely noticed (that I could tell).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt age 5 years old, both boys became more aware of how most other boys dressed <br/>\nand how people responded to boys wearing dresses.  One boy stopped wearing <br/>\ndresses all together soon after he turned 5; he still wears pink (My daughter <br/>\ngave him a pink and black camouflage hat for his birthday last year). Buying <br/>\npink t-shirts and more feminine boy clothes could be an alternative for your <br/>\nson. The other boy still wears dresses that I know of (we do not see them much <br/>\nanymore), which has been wonderful to watch because he is very rough and tumble <br/>\ntype. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have twin, rough and tumble, 19 month old boys and a 5 year old <br/>\nprincess-loving daughter.  As I&#39;m typing this, one of my sons, Liam, came out of <br/>\nthe playroom wearing a pink satin skirt and bracelets.  Yesterday, my other son, <br/>\nFinnian, proudly paraded around the house wearing a Belle costume.  He also <br/>\ngrowled, played cars, threw stuff, and ran in it.  There are &quot;boy&quot; costumes in <br/>\nour costume chest, but they seem to enjoy dressing in the princess costumes the <br/>\nmost. Maybe this is because they have a princess-loving older sister. Maybe it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause they like bright color and sparkles. Maybe it&#39;s because they are playing <br/>\nand exploring and nothing more. Whatever the reason and despite what others <br/>\nmight say or think, I have decided to enjoy watching all of my children dress up <br/>\nrather than judging them or fearing it or predicting their future by what they <br/>\nchoose to wear before age 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when my daughter has worn out of the house overalls and a cowboy hat, <br/>\npeople smile and praise her.

The first problem is that my son and daughter are having more <br/>\nfrequent conflicts and recently my daughter has been hitting or scratching my <br/>\nson again pretty frequently.  My son is 2, my daughter is 3.  It usually happens <br/>\nwhen I am right there, but don&#39;t act quickly enough to stop her.  Sometimes it <br/>\nhappens when I am in another room for a moment, or the bathroom.  For example, <br/>\ntoday I was working on making a pipe cleaner butterfly that she had asked me to <br/>\nmake for her.  Both children were within my reach.  My son was saying that he is <br/>\nNisa, which is my daughter&#39;s name.  She angrily yelled that he is not Nisa, he <br/>\nsaid he is, she yelled back that he is not, then struck him in the face. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is pretty often how it happens around here lately.  Usually they are <br/>\narguing about who they are pretending to be in a play scenario or something like <br/>\nthat.  Occasionally they are just running back and forth in the living room, and <br/>\nthen she will intentionally bump into him roughly and knock him over.  The same <br/>\nthing happens when they jump on the bed together;  they start out jumping <br/>\nhappily, then suddenly she crashes into him and lays on top of him or falls down <br/>\nand starts flailing around until she hits him.  I remove my son from the <br/>\nsituation either before he gets hurt (ideally), or if I am too late, I grab him <br/>\nright away and console him.  When they are starting to get too close on to each <br/>\nother while playing in these situations, I remind them to give each other more <br/>\nspace, but this doesn&#39;t always work.  I usually yell one word forcefully if she <br/>\nstarts to hurt him as I am getting him, or as I am coming to get him.  Sometimes <br/>\n&quot;Stop!&quot;  or &quot;Hey!&quot;  Afterwards I tell her that wasn&#39;t the best way to handle the <br/>\nsituation and we talk about some of the better ways to deal with whatever was <br/>\ngoing on.  Sometimes I don&#39;t talk to her about it, because we have talked about <br/>\nit a lot already, and I think I have a problem with talking too much to them <br/>\nabout a lot of things, which I am working on.  Sometimes I get angry, and take <br/>\nmy son from the room to another room and close the doors, until my adrenaline <br/>\nsettles. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, Shaiah (my son), is very upset when I remove him from a situation that <br/>\nis starting to get ugly.  He wants to play with Nisa, and doesn&#39;t want to be <br/>\nrescued.  Neither respond well to me trying to distract them or get them engaged <br/>\nin a new way.  When he does get hurt, usually recovers pretty quickly and often <br/>\nwants to play with Nisa again right away, before she is ready to play with him <br/>\nagain.  So I will try to keep them apart until she has calmed down.  Other times <br/>\nhe is not so quick to recover and will tell me he doesn&#39;t like Nisa, or that she <br/>\nis mean, and will cry for awhile.  A lot of the time I am playing with them when <br/>\nthis happens, although not for the past week as much because I&#39;ve been sick.  It <br/>\nhas definitely seemed to escalate in the past week while I have been sick.  <br/>\nLuckily my husband has been picking up some of the slack and playing with them a <br/>\nlot. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other challenging situation I am dealing with is that my son really likes to <br/>\nwear dresses.  First my daughter got really into dresses, and that is pretty <br/>\nmuch all she wears now.   Shaiah adores Nisa, and he often copies her every <br/>\nmove.  I know that is an important way that he learns, too.  I think the dress <br/>\nthing is a part of that.  We live in the South, and I don&#39;t think it is socially <br/>\nacceptable or normal here for little boys to wear princess dresses, or any <br/>\ndresses for that matter.  It isn&#39;t a huge deal, as I mostly try to keep the <br/>\ndress wearing to home.  However, my mom knows he likes to wear dresses and is <br/>\nvery upset about it.  She&#39;s seen some pictures and heard him saying he&#39;s a <br/>\nbeautiful princess.  She has told me she thinks we are grooming him to be gay <br/>\nand we shouldn&#39;t allow him to wear dresses, period. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past month or so, Shaiah has worn a dress in public a couple of times.  <br/>\nOnce at the very small, local natural foods store and once at a big music <br/>\nfestival with my husband and daughter.  We just moved here less than a year ago <br/>\nand it is a pretty conservative place in many ways.  People who don&#39;t know <br/>\nbetter just assume he is a girl.  I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea to have <br/>\nhim wear dresses in public.  I have no problem with him wearing dresses, and I <br/>\nlet him wear dresses whenever he wants, at home.  I just think it may negatively <br/>\naffect our family down the road.  We are an interracial couple and already <br/>\npretty different in a lot of ways from many of the long time residents.  There <br/>\nis a wave of new people moving here that aren&#39;t from the South, and they are <br/>\nbringing a fresh energy and economics to the area, which is part of why we are <br/>\nattracted to this town.  It is also 30 minutes from a university town, and from <br/>\nmy sister and her family.  I am looking for some ideas on how to deal with this <br/>\nsituation, because he is frequently inconsolable when he can&#39;t wear a dress.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I can explain the situation in a way he will understand.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally understand that boys and girls wear different clothes and often tells me <br/>\nhe is a girl.  Also, I remember as a child having strong feelings that I <br/>\nshould&#39;ve been a boy and that I really was a boy in a girl&#39;s body.  Sometime <br/>\naround puberty that went away, but I remember it pretty clearly and strongly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I could use some advice on how to stay connected and play with active <br/>\ntoddlers while feeling lousy.  I have been sick for a week with a terrible <br/>\ncough, low energy, and other unpleasant symptoms, and have been much more <br/>\ngrumpy, less present and just generally not mothering the way I normally do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia Koltai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sibling conflict and gender identification questions","postDate":"1309185564","msgId":61761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCNzQyQ0E1QjkyMDQ3ODNCNjI0MkNBRkZBNTY4MUZEQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl1OTIxMis1bDdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPjwwREJBM0M5QTcyMEM0NzlGQTBENEJCMjkzNzIyMzI5RkBkZWJvcmFoNDNmMTNmZD4gPEJBTkxrVGltQlEwV0wwTkdTZ09HZkx3Q29aTUExUVFqbytnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61760,"nextInTopic":61762,"prevInTime":61760,"nextInTime":61762,"topicId":61755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a kind of fun article from Wikipedia about the days when little boys were routinely clothed in dresses and gowns.

Everyone<br/>\nthought my boys were girls, though they wore mostly reds and greens.<br/>\nThey were not wearing dresses at the time.  My eldest had a blues<br/>\nclues t-shirt he loved.  The shirt was a purplish blue.  People who<br/>\nthought he was male described him as wearing a blue shirt, but people<br/>\nwho thought he was female thought his shirt was purple.  People who<br/>\nwere strangers sometimes identified him wrongly as a girl, and often<br/>\napologised.  Rowan didn&#39;t understand why he should be insulted by<br/>\nsomeone mistaking him for a girl--some of his best friends and his mom<br/>\nwere female:)  He identified sex as genitalia.  I&#39;m a boy because I<br/>\nhave a penis.  He once told a woman midst apology: colours don&#39;t have<br/>\nsex only people do.  He meant as a two/three year old he noticed<br/>\npeople were either male or female.  We had to talk to him about the<br/>\ninappropriateness of following the examples of adults in this case:<br/>\nRowan would ask adult people if they had a penis or vulva many times<br/>\nas a two or three year old.  He started making a big deal about it<br/>\nbecause adults always wanted to know his sex--so he would ask theirs.<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t ask if they were male or female, but if they had a penis!<br/>\nConfusing him was some larger men seemed to have breasts.  Some woman<br/>\nhad short hair and some men had long hair.  He wasn&#39;t meeting men in<br/>\ndresses because we didn&#39;t have anyone in our small circle who ddi,<br/>\nexcept at a cousins wedding where there were men in kilts, but lots of<br/>\nwomen wore pants:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle son took ballet at age four-five and insisted on wearing<br/>\npink slippers like all the other students.  The others were girls, but<br/>\nthe salesman at the dance supply shop kept trying to steer him to the<br/>\nblack slippers and the black tights.

The first problem is that my son and daughter are having more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-706535090\">I am looking for ways to better deal with a couple of situations going on in my home right now.  The first problem is that my son and daughter are having more frequent conflicts and recently my daughter has been hitting or scratching my son again pretty frequently.  My son is 2, my daughter is 3.  It usually happens when I am right there, but don&#39;t act quickly enough to stop her.  Sometimes it happens when I am in another room for a moment, or the bathroom.  For example, today I was working on making a pipe cleaner butterfly that she had asked me to make for her.  Both children were within my reach.  My son was saying that he is Nisa, which is my daughter&#39;s name.  She angrily yelled that he is not Nisa, he said he is, she yelled back that he is not, then struck him in the face.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is pretty often how it happens around here lately.  Usually they are arguing about who they are pretending to be in a play scenario or something like that.  Occasionally they are just running back and forth in the living room, and then she will intentionally bump into him roughly and knock him over.  The same thing happens when they jump on the bed together;  they start out jumping happily, then suddenly she crashes into him and lays on top of him or falls down and starts flailing around until she hits him.  I remove my son from the situation either before he gets hurt (ideally), or if I am too late, I grab him right away and console him.  When they are starting to get too close on to each other while playing in these situations, I remind them to give each other more space, but this doesn&#39;t always work.  I usually yell one word forcefully if she starts to hurt him as I am getting him, or as I am coming to get him.  Sometimes &quot;Stop!&quot;  or &quot;Hey!&quot;  Afterwards I tell her that wasn&#39;t the best way to handle the situation and we talk about some of the better ways to deal with whatever was going on.  Sometimes I don&#39;t talk to her about it, because we have talked about it a lot already, and I think I have a problem with talking too much to them about a lot of things, which I am working on.  Sometimes I get angry, and take my son from the room to another room and close the doors, until my adrenaline settles. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, Shaiah (my son), is very upset when I remove him from a situation that is starting to get ugly.  He wants to play with Nisa, and doesn&#39;t want to be rescued.  Neither respond well to me trying to distract them or get them engaged in a new way.  When he does get hurt, usually recovers pretty quickly and often wants to play with Nisa again right away, before she is ready to play with him again.  So I will try to keep them apart until she has calmed down.  Other times he is not so quick to recover and will tell me he doesn&#39;t like Nisa, or that she is mean, and will cry for awhile.  A lot of the time I am playing with them when this happens, although not for the past week as much because I&#39;ve been sick.  It has definitely seemed to escalate in the past week while I have been sick.  Luckily my husband has been picking up some of the slack and playing with them a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other challenging situation I am dealing with is that my son really likes to wear dresses.  First my daughter got really into dresses, and that is pretty much all she wears now.   Shaiah adores Nisa, and he often copies her every move.  I know that is an important way that he learns, too.  I think the dress thing is a part of that.  We live in the South, and I don&#39;t think it is socially acceptable or normal here for little boys to wear princess dresses, or any dresses for that matter.  It isn&#39;t a huge deal, as I mostly try to keep the dress wearing to home.  However, my mom knows he likes to wear dresses and is very upset about it.  She&#39;s seen some pictures and heard him saying he&#39;s a beautiful princess.  She has told me she thinks we are grooming him to be gay and we shouldn&#39;t allow him to wear dresses, period.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past month or so, Shaiah has worn a dress in public a couple of times.  Once at the very small, local natural foods store and once at a big music festival with my husband and daughter.  We just moved here less than a year ago and it is a pretty conservative place in many ways.  People who don&#39;t know better just assume he is a girl.  I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea to have him wear dresses in public.  I have no problem with him wearing dresses, and I let him wear dresses whenever he wants, at home.  I just think it may negatively affect our family down the road.  We are an interracial couple and already pretty different in a lot of ways from many of the long time residents.  There is a wave of new people moving here that aren&#39;t from the South, and they are bringing a fresh energy and economics to the area, which is part of why we are attracted to this town.  It is also 30 minutes from a university town, and from my sister and her family.  I am looking for some ideas on how to deal with this situation, because he is frequently inconsolable when he can&#39;t wear a dress.  I don&#39;t think I can explain the situation in a way he will understand.  He doesn&#39;t really understand that boys and girls wear different clothes and often tells me he is a girl.  Also, I remember as a child having strong feelings that I should&#39;ve been a boy and that I really was a boy in a girl&#39;s body.  Sometime around puberty that went away, but I remember it pretty clearly and strongly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I could use some advice on how to stay connected and play with active toddlers while feeling lousy.  I have been sick for a week with a terrible cough, low energy, and other unpleasant symptoms, and have been much more grumpy, less present and just generally not mothering the way I normally do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia Koltai</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61809,"nextTopicId":61832}}
