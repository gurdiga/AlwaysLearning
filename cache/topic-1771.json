It&#39;s<br/>\nbasically a catagorization thing - you give examples of things that are<br/>\n&quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; of a category, and the person tries to guess the category.<br/>\nSo, I could say &quot;Bowling is in my family, but swimming isn&#39;t. Basketball<br/>\nis in my family but archery isn&#39;t.&quot; and you would try to guess the<br/>\ncategory. We play that a person can ask, &quot;Is X in your family?&quot; and you<br/>\ntell them yes or no....  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re funny, really. Fun,<br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do Hinky Pinkies, if anyone knows those. You think of two (or<br/>\nmore) rhyming words that go together and then give a clue that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nuse the word - so, you could think of &quot;fat cat&quot; and the clue would be &quot;An<br/>\noverweight feline&quot;. Actually, that&#39;s a hink pink, because it&#39;s two<br/>\none-syllables words... there are hink pinks, hinky pinkies, hinkedy<br/>\npinkedies, etc., and you specify which you&#39;re doing with the clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played both of those as a kid... Cacie and I also play &quot;I&#39;m a Harry<br/>\nPotter character&quot; (think 20 Questions, although we don&#39;t limit it) but<br/>\nthat&#39;s a much never invention... it&#39;s also harder than it sounds, we&#39;ve<br/>\nboth read the books at least twice each and still stump each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
