Manish and Shilpa Jain <br/>\n(India) have also put some emphasis on learning as an &quot;alternative to <br/>\neducation.&quot;   It was also implied by Ivan Illich in &quot;Deschooling <br/>\nSociety&quot; and books by John Holt and others.<br/>\nTheir point is that the t/e/s syndrome is about transferring things <br/>\nchosen and known by some adults to young people.  &quot;Learning&quot; implies <br/>\nbuilding on each individual&#39;s  curiosity, interest, ability, and <br/>\nmotivation -- unschooling.  Freedom to learn is the core of democracy.  <br/>\nThe e/t/s syndrome is the key to maintaining the status quo of the <br/>\ndominator paradigm  -- authoritarianism, materialism, self-interest, <br/>\ncompetition and hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the core of the Gaian Paradigm that recognizes the equality of <br/>\nall elements of the cosmos including each individual human.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Ellis<br/>\nIf you would like more on the GaianParadigm see:<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Bill_Ellis\">http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Bill_Ellis</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27402,"nextTopicId":27403}}
