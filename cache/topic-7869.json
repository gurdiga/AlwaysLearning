My youngest son was put into speech <br/>\ntherapy in junior kindergarten. He was set up with a special summer <br/>\nprogram at the hospital. He was supposed to go twice a week <br/>\nthroughout the summer. Upon intake, the speech pathologist did not <br/>\nfeel he needed intervention. She felt most of his difficulties would <br/>\nself-correct. However, since the school requested the intervention <br/>\nshe began a program. After one week, she cut the sessions to one a <br/>\nweek. Then after three weeks she &quot;graduated&quot; him from the program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next year in school, he was back in speech therapy within the <br/>\nschool system. He participated until the end of Grade One. This was <br/>\nhis last year of formal schooling. They kept sending home target <br/>\nsounds that he was pronouncing correctly at home. I think that he was<br/>\nself-conscious at school. Therefore it was more of a school related <br/>\ncondition than a physical difficulty. <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted he has a class 2 maloccusion which he needs to have <br/>\northopedic intervention for. This has caused a little difficulty, but <br/>\nI believe the school-based speech therapy drew too much attention to <br/>\nthe problem and did not offer solutions in respect to the skeletal <br/>\ndefect. He is doing much better at home. Of course!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":61087048,"authorName":"Melinda","from":"Melinda &lt;melinda2u@...&gt;","profile":"melinda2u","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 434 On Writing and other pursuits other","postDate":"1026744514","msgId":7869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzE1MTQ0ODM0LjQyNTUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjY3MjA3MTcuMTk3My45MDE5Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7875,"prevInTime":7868,"nextInTime":7870,"topicId":7869,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Sharon, That s very Optimistic of you.

And kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am fully aware that I stayed away from the<br/>\npursuit on purpose.  Being forced to write about<br/>\nissues that didn&#39;t interest me made me not want to<br/>\nwrite at all ...   and eventually to come to avoid it<br/>\nentirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have addressed writing Specifically.   But the same<br/>\nstatements could be applied to any course of study<br/>\nthat is coerced and involuntary.  Golfing, knitting,<br/>\nreading, cooking, ...   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy G__,  I imagine even Talking could become an<br/>\nactivity to loathe and run from if you were<br/>\n&quot;instructed&quot; in how to do it &quot;properly&quot;.  And if <br/>\nevery time you opened your mouth some &quot;expert&quot; opined<br/>\non your every word.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe writing is as well learned as reading and<br/>\nspeaking are by example.  By reading , being read to,<br/>\nand developing a personal and positive relationship<br/>\nwith letters, sounds, words, literature and finally<br/>\nputting it together as the individual feels<br/>\ncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t sit our children down at the table on the day<br/>\nthey are born and begin instructing them on the rules<br/>\nof language.  They learn to speak by speaking and<br/>\nbeing around those who speak well is the best teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nWalking is learned by doing it.  By gradually<br/>\nmastering the steps that lead to it.  Not by reading<br/>\nabout them or being lectured on them.  Having a hand<br/>\nto hold every now and then works wonders.  Being<br/>\ntalked at about what is the&quot;correct&quot; way to walk would<br/>\nbe as useless as instruction in most pursuits is. <br/>\nMaybe knowledge of the activity would be advanced, but<br/>\nthe do-er still has to find her own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the perspective I was coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate that you seem to have taken this personally.<br/>\nThe examples you have listed below could apply just as<br/>\neasily.  If I spend time around an accomplished<br/>\ncalligrapher or read about it and am fascinated,<br/>\nbecome interested , begin practicing the techniques<br/>\nand ASK for instruction then that is the perfect time<br/>\nfor the accomplished one to offer it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same would be true for any art, music, dance,<br/>\netc......<br/>\n(Brick laying or shoe selling for that matter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe harm is in the involuntary &quot;educating&quot;.  The<br/>\nmandatory and proscribed &quot;methods&quot; used in teaching<br/>\ntend to kill the joy and render the student<br/>\nirrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat any writing could be viewed apart from its<br/>\ncontent will never make sense to me.  Maybe this is a<br/>\nvery personal view. But without the idea or<br/>\nperspective coming across, it&#39;s just a waste of time<br/>\nand paper.  There are better uses for trees than that.<br/>\nWriting is about Expression.  Techniques and rules<br/>\ncan&#39;t stand alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that writing ought to be reserved for those<br/>\nwho have something to say.  Reading and being read to<br/>\nteach much about good writing and a willing listener<br/>\nwill pick it up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as &quot;late&quot; readers tend to &quot;make up&quot; for YEARS<br/>\nworth of non-reading, those who write when they have a<br/>\nthought worthy of penning can quickly and easily<br/>\nacquire the mechanical imperatives of good writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly to me, those who are not forced to<br/>\nwrite when they have nothing to say will not be pushed<br/>\naway from it out of desperation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know, as anyone else here does, that your approach<br/>\nto learning is a very positive one. It is clear that<br/>\nyou gave your students as much freedom and latitude as<br/>\nthe system you were functioning in allowed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the System that I find fault with, not those who<br/>\noperate within it and attempt to maintain their<br/>\nIntegrity. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny system that requires its participants to mirror<br/>\ncreativity with on-demand assignments is working<br/>\nagainst itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMelinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Perhaps your creativity hasn&#39;t been ruined or even<br/>\n&gt; delayed.

Makes you<br/>\n&gt; wonder if any of these teachers actually consider<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; merits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule<br/>\n&gt; breaking<br/>\n&gt; and original perspective.  Or, do they actually<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy<br/>\n&gt; the crap examples in grammar text books? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I was teaching writing to kids I very rarely<br/>\n&gt; commented on the structure <br/>\n&gt; or content, because in many cases that was their<br/>\n&gt; private business.  I usually <br/>\n&gt; ONLY went for mechanics of writing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I&#39;m teaching beginning calligraphers, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want them to imagine what <br/>\n&gt; a Carolingian &quot;f&quot; COULD have looked at, I want them<br/>\n&gt; to learn to copy actual <br/>\n&gt; period examples.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I&#39;m helping people learn to play recorder (as I<br/>\n&gt; did with Kirby a couple <br/>\n&gt; of nights ago), I really do want them to tongue<br/>\n&gt; every note.  YES there are <br/>\n&gt; exceptions galore after you learn to do it right,<br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s one thing to <br/>\n&gt; choose when not to tongue, and another not to have<br/>\n&gt; the skill to do it and so <br/>\n&gt; just skip and claim &quot;art.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With calligraphy, in fact there might be hundreds of<br/>\n&gt; different examples of <br/>\n&gt; extant Carolingian hand, with a large range of forms<br/>\n&gt; of letters.  But that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not the same as &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;no rules.&quot;  Some of<br/>\n&gt; the most wonderful <br/>\n&gt; calligraphy is someone &quot;doing a riff&quot; on some<br/>\n&gt; descender, or getting way artsy <br/>\n&gt; with a line ending or a capital letter.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Literature is full of exceptions.  Jazz is full of<br/>\n&gt; exceptions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But when a person is cluefree about how to do<br/>\n&gt; something &quot;right,&quot; his <br/>\n&gt; &quot;embellishments&quot; aren&#39;t creativity so much as<br/>\n&gt; flailing around.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some people&#39;s flailing around creates art.  There<br/>\n&gt; are artists and musicians <br/>\n&gt; who pretty much made it up on their own.  Some have<br/>\n&gt; an audience of one, <br/>\n&gt; though, and are only amusing themselves.  Others<br/>\n&gt; discover something that has <br/>\n&gt; broader appeal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt; Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>\n&gt; the crap examples in grammar text books?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have always enjoyed the history of English, the<br/>\n&gt; technicalities of <br/>\n&gt; punctuation, the changing fashions involving word<br/>\n&gt; use and style.  I&#39;ve never <br/>\n&gt; expected everyone else to think it was cool, but I<br/>\n&gt; actually enjoyed the crap <br/>\n&gt; examples in grammar textbooks, sometime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That said, I never once used a grammar text book<br/>\n&gt; when I was teaching.  We <br/>\n&gt; kept the books in their boxes at the back of the<br/>\n&gt; room, and used dictionaries. <br/>\n&gt;  We played games with parts of speech sometimes, and<br/>\n&gt; goofed with them various <br/>\n&gt; ways.  We would lay out all the synonyms we could<br/>\n&gt; think of for something and <br/>\n&gt; try to identify without looking them up which were<br/>\n&gt; of what origin, and which <br/>\n&gt; were the oldest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>\n&gt; the written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>\n&gt; of forced writing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Shame on them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not ashamed for using writing to help people<br/>\n&gt; write.  Our usual in-class <br/>\n&gt; writing system was that they were to write three<br/>\n&gt; one-page (or longer) <br/>\n&gt; anythings.  Little stories, reviews, opinions.  It<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t matter.  Three <br/>\n&gt; pages.  They picked the one they liked best, or<br/>\n&gt; thought was the best on top, <br/>\n&gt; fastened the three together and over the weekend I<br/>\n&gt; read through at least all <br/>\n&gt; the top pages, sometimes more.  I wasn&#39;t criticizing<br/>\n&gt; their organization or <br/>\n&gt; style.  That was going to get better as they just<br/>\n&gt; wrote more.  I was only <br/>\n&gt; looking at mechanics.  Spelling, grammar,<br/>\n&gt; punctuation, sentence structure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could have collected my paycheck without doing<br/>\n&gt; that.  I could have passed <br/>\n&gt; out those books and gone through some dumbass<br/>\n&gt; exercise every day and NEVER <br/>\n&gt; worked outside my prep period, but I didn&#39;t. <br/>\n&gt; Because I like writing and I <br/>\n&gt; know writing is scary, I tried to help make it a<br/>\n&gt; common, non-threatening, <br/>\n&gt; amusing thing for them.  If they hadn&#39;t had me as an<br/>\n&gt; English teacher they <br/>\n&gt; would have had someone worse.  So I&#39;m not very<br/>\n&gt; ashamed of the way I taught.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m somewhat ashamed that I couldn&#39;t change things<br/>\n&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
