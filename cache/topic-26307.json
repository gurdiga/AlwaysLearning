Hold on....still smiling too much from watching that happy video..okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor several months Sorscha has been into the country singer Gretchen Wilson.  The new Dixie Chicks CD came out and since I know that she likes that twangy country sounding music I went and purchased it for her yesterday.  One of the songs says, &quot;and I&#39;m mad as hell...&quot;   This line is one of the climax points of the song so we both have been walking around singing it in high pitched voices.   About 1/2 hour ago Sorscha asked me what &quot;hell&quot; meant and I gave her several definitions.  She was satisfied and I went on to check my emails where Joyce posted the &quot;Where the Hell is Matt?&quot; video.  I pressed the link and there it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon seeing it I was very excited.  Sorscha and I had seen this gentleman on a morning show several weeks ago and I had meant to pull up the video at that time...but obviously never did.  I called Sorscha over, she looked at the screen and said, &quot;HELL!  Mom there it is.  Does it mean the same thing?&quot; I answered her and then we played the video. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs the video rolled on, all the sudden Sorscha yelled out, &quot;Venice, Italy!!!  That&#39;s where Sly Cooper goes.&quot;  For those of you who do not know, Sly Cooper is a video game.  Sorscha then left and began to play one of her Sly Cooper games. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought this was great and wanted to share.  It seems my daughters world is a giant puzzle and she keeps adding little pieces along her journey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be seeing ya&#39;ll at the conference in NM, <br/>\nCrystal and Sorscha<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197421595,"authorName":"Katy","from":"&quot;Katy&quot; &lt;kjennings95@...&gt;","profile":"coyotegoddess95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Where the Hell is Matt?","postDate":"1153262576","msgId":26323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNy1EQVY5NjFGOTkyOEMxM0FDMzdDOTY1N0RCRTYzMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzE4MTQyNTQyLjM0NzY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8RTFDQTFCMkItNDBEMS00M0U0LTlBMzktMjJFQ0U0REM3RjhBQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDw0MDg4NkM5Ri1FMDI3LTQ1QjYtODBGQS01QUU4NUM3QTFFN0ZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26320,"nextInTopic":26324,"prevInTime":26322,"nextInTime":26324,"topicId":26307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-788153619\">Sandra wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;WHAT IS with lullabyes like that!?
