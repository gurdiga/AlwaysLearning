Most of the time we do whatever has his interest at<br/>\nthat time. (Currently popular: playdough and modelling clay, various<br/>\niPad apps, YouTube videos about the planets, playing at<br/>\nmama-and-baby-animals, and a whole bunch of other things.) <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll suggest something I think he might like (visit a friend,<br/>\nbike ride, go to the Science Museum, watch a particular programme, a<br/>\ncool new app), or give him something I&#39;ve found or ordered that I<br/>\nthought he might enjoy (play food, a big box of new Playdoh, cool<br/>\nstickers). Sometimes I&#39;m right, occasionally I&#39;m not :) <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we have errands to run. Sometimes I have to find creative ways<br/>\nto make that more fun. Sometimes we go to playgroups or swimming or<br/>\nwhatever. Some things happen on certain days -- e.g. the Monday<br/>\nplaygroup only happens every other Monday -- and some things fit well on<br/>\ncertain days. But that doesn&#39;t mean that we *have* to go to Monday<br/>\nplaygroup if Leon really just wants to stay home that day. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can follow your kids&#39; interests and wishes. (Though obviously with<br/>\ntwo that&#39;s harder than just one -- you need to get more creative meeting<br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *** 2. TV and ipad - Friday is iPad day. (my son says &#39;I am excited about<br/>\n&gt; tomorrow&#39; on every Thursday) we set time to friday just to make sure they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to fall back on to iPad everyday when they are bored.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fear of addiction ... to the medium.. does such a thing exist ?***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does your fear exist? I guess it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes iPad addiction exist? Nope. Not in healthy happy kids. Maybe in<br/>\nunhappy kids who have a need to escape. But unschooled kids are free to<br/>\nchoose what they *want* to do when they want to do it -- assuming you<br/>\ndon&#39;t screw that up by, say, telling them they can only do something at<br/>\na particular time.<br/>\n<br/>\niPads are amazing tools. There is SO MUCH you can do with an iPad. So<br/>\nmuch to learn, so much fun to have. Why would you restrict that? Your<br/>\nson looks forward so much to Fridays -- wouldn&#39;t it be better if he<br/>\nlooked forward just as much to *every* day? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou say &quot;falling back on iPad when they&#39;re bored&quot;. Why is that bad? If<br/>\nwhatever they&#39;re doing on the iPad is more fun than everything else<br/>\naround them, why shouldn&#39;t they do the fun thing? When it&#39;s not fun --<br/>\nwhen building Lego or chasing each other round the garden or whatever is<br/>\nmore fun -- then they&#39;ll do that instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think they&#39;re doing *anything* (not just something that happens<br/>\nto be on the iPad -- and as above, that covers a lot of things!) because<br/>\nthey lack other options, then it&#39;s your job to provide other fun things.<br/>\nLay out the train tracks, or suggest a game that they love (Leon will<br/>\ndrop pretty much anything to play acrobatics with me; unfortunately<br/>\nthat&#39;s time-limited by my stamina :) ) or start building something<br/>\nyourself. (And then don&#39;t be hurt or sad if they don&#39;t want to do that.<br/>\nThey have choices, and they&#39;re choosing what they want! That&#39;s good!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *** 3.

You could gently reply<br/>\nwith &quot;you can do it whenever you&#39;re ready&quot; -- but maybe stop asking him<br/>\nto try, and wait for him to want to try. He&#39;s been told he shouldn&#39;t<br/>\ntry; it may take a while before he&#39;s comfortable to try again. <br/>\n<br/>\n(LOADS of cool stuff about natural reading learning here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>\n<br/>\n)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Introduction and Questions","postDate":"1433537712","msgId":75954,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzU0RkNGLTJBMUItNDY1QS1CRkE2LTI5QzY5QTdBMEM1N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBSzl1K2dWNUZZaVliWTE0Qzg2MDc2UXZKNzJpb0JNSlhBOVZSYmIxRWl5OGdUb3hMd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBSzl1K2dWNUZZaVliWTE0Qzg2MDc2UXZKNzJpb0JNSlhBOVZSYmIxRWl5OGdUb3hMd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75953,"nextInTopic":75965,"prevInTime":75953,"nextInTime":75955,"topicId":75953,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-2 kids 3 1/2(boy) and 2(girl). -=- As they re too young for school in California, you are doing a different sort of parenting, but it s not yet unschooling.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1024689772\">-=-2 kids 3 1/2(boy) and 2(girl). -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they&#39;re too young for school in California, you are doing a different sort of parenting, but it&#39;s not yet unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with India is that when the grandparents put pressure, there&#39;s not much way out.
