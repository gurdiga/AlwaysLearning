They could tell such<br/>\na difference between the kids that wanted to be there and the kids that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t, the kids who were engaged and the kids who were being forced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey talked to me about it because I was heading up the drama club (I<br/>\nrefused to call it a class) and we were having so much fun.  I talked with<br/>\nthem about the right to choose, and respecting even those under 18 years<br/>\nold.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends made a rule that kids can only come if they want to be there (no<br/>\nmama made me stuff) and that the child is responsible for their class,<br/>\nassignments, test scores, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is working beautifully and the tutors comment on what a high functioning<br/>\ngroup the kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16752,"nextTopicId":16838}}
