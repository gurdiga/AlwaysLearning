(And it was 25 cents plus 5 cents for a carton of <br/>\nmilk.) The tray lunch typically had a meat, a starch, a vegetable, and a <br/>\nfruit. Typical would be meatloaf, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and fruit <br/>\ncocktail. We were not allowed to leave the table until we&#39;d raised our <br/>\nhand and gotten permission from the &quot;lunch lady.&quot; The lunch lady would <br/>\nnot dismiss us to go out and play until all our vegetables were eaten. I <br/>\nused to stuff mine in my milk carton, but the problem was that she would <br/>\nalso shake that, to make sure we drank all of our milk. So I&#39;d try to <br/>\nsmash the veggies down with my straw so that they wouldn&#39;t shake (and I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t put much in there because they&#39;d be heavy and she&#39;d realize <br/>\nthere was something in the carton). I threw up in the cafeteria once, <br/>\ngagging while trying to swallow a bit of canned green beans.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there are many articles out there that promote that kind <br/>\nof approach, these days.

Secondly, why couldn&#39;t you give some<br/>\nchoices before making them food, and thirdly, if you make something like<br/>\na tuna sandwhich, and they change their minds, why can&#39;t you wrap those<br/>\nup and put them in the fridge for the next time you run and errand and<br/>\nneed to pack some snacks.  How cool that would be, to already have stuff<br/>\nready made up, and a tuna sandwhich could sit wrapped in the fridge for<br/>\nat least a couple of days and still be good to eat.

It&#39;s an age where a girl is examing herself and who she is and<br/>\nwhat her body is like and making connections about food and body image<br/>\nand all of that.  By controlling and forcing her to be or eat a certain<br/>\nway, you are denying her the her own judgement, which is really really<br/>\nimportant for her to grow into the woman she will be.

Being present with my kids is great and seems to result in more peace and fun and less stress. I get anxious and I know my kids totally pick up on it. As I work toward better methods of being and living my anxiety level has gone way down. I feel like a different person. I love it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the food area my two little ones are great, eat great, I don&#39;t feel like there are any issues. My oldest is a little bit picky, probably from me feeding her not enough variety as a youngster and while I used to have the &quot;you have to try it&quot; rule, I have given that up too. My hubby is concerned her eating habits and pickiness are going to rub off or influence the babies. He also criticized her about being picky. I want to back off and let her make her own choices, he&#39;s afraid the younger ones will then make bad choices because they are following her lead. I don&#39;t know how to approach this. Showing my husband an article by Sandra will probably not convince him. He will claim he could find articles about forcing kids to eat what&#39;s in front of them (actually he did claim), no special treatment.  <br/>\nThis discussion started because I &quot;let&quot; the oldest have a cheese sandwich instead of a tuna sandwich like everyone else was eating.
