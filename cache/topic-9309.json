A night out with adults! We had a<br/>\nlot of fun and it seemed to make us feel like the old &quot;us&quot; couple - before<br/>\nkids - at least for a while.<br/>\nWe felt like we reconnected and my dh really appreciated being able to spend<br/>\ntime with me without the kids.<br/>\nMy FIL really appreciated spending time with the boys and getting to know<br/>\nthem better, too.<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice that we can do this because I feel better leaving the kids because<br/>\nthey&#39;re getting older now (9 & 11). I felt uncomfortable leaving them when<br/>\nthey were younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9308,"nextTopicId":9302}}
