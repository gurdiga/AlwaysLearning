Teaching didn&#39;t help the teachers, so I can&#39;t imagine how it  <br/>\ncould help the next generation of kids.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nJude x<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Nagging concern","postDate":"1266352257","msgId":50835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2Qzc4Q0VBLUQ0RTEtNEY5RC04ODg2LTU4M0Y5OTQ4MUJFREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZDQwMWNhYWYzZiRjZmM2YzA3MCQ2ZjU0NDE1MCRAbmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":50834,"nextInTopic":50846,"prevInTime":50834,"nextInTime":50836,"topicId":50684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-For a while she did the coloring books that were just patterns - the geometrical ones - but usually she liked the Dover ones with people or the really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-407695456\">-=-For a while she did the<br/>\ncoloring books that were just patterns - the geometrical ones - but  <br/>\nusually<br/>\nshe liked the Dover ones with people or the really beautiful nature  <br/>\nones -<br/>\nRoses, Butterflies, etc. She colored in all the pictures in the same<br/>\ncoloring books multiple times - I bought duplicates of the ones she  <br/>\nliked<br/>\nthe most, multiple times. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the Dover books are marked &quot;Pictorial Archive Series&quot; in the  <br/>\nfront, and when they are you can not only photocopy them all you want,  <br/>\nyou could use them for other kinds of projects.

She likes to color in coloring<br/>\nbooks. When she was little and liked that, I thought it was too bad that she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t more into being creative - I thought drawing her own pictures was<br/>\n&quot;superior&quot; to coloring in coloring books. Looking back, I realize that she<br/>\nwas playing around with the lines in the coloring book - using color to<br/>\ncreate shapes from the lines. It was very mathematical for her - still is -<br/>\nshe&#39;s 19 and sometimes buys herself a Dover coloring book and still loves<br/>\nher prismacolor colored pencils.  She has got an awareness of line and shape<br/>\nand space that is serving her well in a college calculus class. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKids really and truly do not need to be doing things that look like math to<br/>\nus school-damaged parents. We are damaged, imo, when we can&#39;t see the value<br/>\nin what our kids are choosing to do because it doesn&#39;t appear to us to be<br/>\ncontributing to learning something recognizable to us. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - now - some people reading this will probably go buy their kids coloring<br/>\nbooks in hopes that will turn them into good math students someday in the<br/>\nfuture, right? &lt;G&gt;  But, notice it didn&#39;t matter at ALL whether I recognized<br/>\nwhat Rosie was doing as building &quot;math skills.&quot; All that mattered was I<br/>\nsupplied her with what she enjoyed. I was always on the lookout for cool<br/>\ncoloring books. And she went through phases with them - some were simple,<br/>\nbut as she got older she liked the more sophisticated ones - historical ones<br/>\nand fashion through the ages, etc. She also did some of the Bellerophon<br/>\ncoloring books, but never liked them as much as the Dovers, even though they<br/>\nappear more complex, I think because the lines are less defined, they are<br/>\nmore sketchy and have more open-ended space in them. For a while she did the<br/>\ncoloring books that were just patterns - the geometrical ones - but usually<br/>\nshe liked the Dover ones with people or the really beautiful nature ones -<br/>\nRoses, Butterflies, etc. She colored in all the pictures in the same<br/>\ncoloring books multiple times - I bought duplicates of the ones she liked<br/>\nthe most, multiple times. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Nagging concern","postDate":"1266344630","msgId":50832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMzU4Ny4xNTMwOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2REIwNURDLTE5NTMtNDkwOS04QjdDLUMyOUQwQkJGNzdENUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhsMzBmcStrYTFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OUFFNkU4NTgtNUY3MS00OUY1LUE5RTYtOEY1MThCOEQ2MzBEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8Mzc0ODUxLjU3MTMxLnFtQHdlYjExMTgwOS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw2MTMwOTFFMC0zN0U1LTRBQUItODU3RC02MjA4QUJGQjQ1MTFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwzYTkzZmZmMTEwMDIxNjAzMjRwMzVlYmFmOWV2Nzg3NGNlMzMzNjFhYzI3ZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDU2REIwNURDLTE5NTMtNDkwOS04QjdDLUMyOUQwQkJGNzdENUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50831,"nextInTopic":50834,"prevInTime":50831,"nextInTime":50833,"topicId":50684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Don t think of it as just numbers, though (my kids did that too, so I m no knocking playing with numbers). *** To me, numbers have to do with patterns.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-228391484\">***Don&#39;t think of it as just &quot;numbers,&quot; though (my kids did that too, so <br/>\nI&#39;m no knocking playing with numbers). ***<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, numbers have to do with patterns.

It&#39;s digital and easier to figure time concepts from than having<br/>\nto figure out the whole analog deal.  On a meta level it means me getting<br/>\nfriendlier with numbers now that I&#39;m *not* in school, like Joyce says. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried to be (because it&#39;s expected of school kids) as analytical and<br/>\nabstract as I can in the past. Now I realize the value of appreciating my<br/>\nown ways of learning about the world ... which is very tactile and visual,<br/>\nand I have found ways to play with the concepts that numbers are visually<br/>\nand yes.. legos is a great way to do that for Karl. He actually calls the<br/>\npiece he&#39;s looking for by the number of interlocking bumps he sees, and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll look for another one in the color he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nI purposely picked small things to notice. Karl doesn&#39;t often mention what<br/>\nhe notices about time or ask questions but he does sometimes. He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nplay with legos all day long usually. But when he does play with numbers I<br/>\nknow he is getting a lot out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 2:37 AM, suzette &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bizeeemom@...\">bizeeemom@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Never asked a question or voiced a concern on this list but here goes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have 4 kids ages 13,11,8 & 3.

For  <br/>\ninstance, kids don&#39;t need reading programs. They need pleasant  <br/>\nexperiences with the written word, someone who will answer their  <br/>\nquestions, a personally meaningful need to get something by reading  <br/>\nand they will get reading when they&#39;re developmentally ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that concerns me is that so many people have been  <br/>\ndamaged by school math that they&#39;re happy to be free of math. Kids  <br/>\nwill have a harder time getting pleasant experiences with math if  <br/>\ntheir parents are gleefully avoiding numbers because there&#39;s no one  <br/>\nto make them do calculations anymore. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be quite a bit of math in their lives if kids have an  <br/>\nallowance and play video games. :-) But it will be helpful to have  <br/>\nmeasuring tools as handy as crayons: rulers, tape measures, stop  <br/>\nwatch, nested measuring cups (they make great bath toys :-). Even  <br/>\nbetter will be parents who don&#39;t avoid measuring and counting and  <br/>\ncomparing because of bad flashbacks from school. Numbers should be as  <br/>\nnatural a part of life as words.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And measuring needn&#39;t be done with a ruler. It can be done with a  <br/>\nstring or the thing itself. Probably for kids who build things with  <br/>\nLegos, it&#39;s natural to measure in bricks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be good to have board and card games (and parents who enjoy  <br/>\nplaying them). Sports. Collections to sort in various ways. (It can  <br/>\nbe rocks picked up on walks, plastic dinosaurs, model cars, leaves,  <br/>\npencils, Beanies, Pokemon ...) Maps. Google Maps (which will  <br/>\nincorporate mileage.) Spreadsheets for recording collections. (I  <br/>\nhelped Kathryn set up several databases for Pokemon so she could keep  <br/>\ntrack of various things.)

I&#39;ve been unschooling since the older three were 9,7 & 5. Maybe earlier than that really but I found a name for what we did when they were around those ages. Anyway, for the most part we just live our lives and really enjoy each others company. My oldest, in fact, was just having a conversation with her brothers about the three of them renting a house together when they move out. They like being with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay here is my concern. My boys ages 11 & 8 have no desire to do any formal math curriculum.
