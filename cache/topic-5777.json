She <br/>\noften paints wooden boxes with tempura or watercolours. She&#39;s <br/>\npainted CD and tape boxes, trinket boxes and storage boxes. <br/>\nShe says she wants to paint her wooden shelves next. Most of <br/>\nthem came from IKEA, so they&#39;re raw wood with no finish on <br/>\nthem - hence very easy to paint with whatever. Watercolours are <br/>\nawesome on them - sorta looks like coloured wood stain. She <br/>\nwants to plant a garden this year so I will suggest the stakes and <br/>\ndividers to her.
