He learned to read playing the online game Roblox.<br/>\nHe was reading fluently at around 6 and a half.<br/>\nHe is 9 now and is a  great kid.<br/>\nHe still loves playing games but just a little while ago he wanted to know if his dad was going to go running so he could go ride his bike on the trail with him. They have started doing that and he loves to go ride his bike when dad runs. They did not go tonight but they went outside and played basketball. <br/>\n I have never limited his TV, video game playing or computer. He actually has all the newer computer  systems, a TV with satellite in his room plus his computer. <br/>\nWith all that he plays a  lot of pretend with his sister and even reads her a book once in a while  like in the video.<br/>\nHe comes to me a lot to tell me about his games and videos and ideas he has.
