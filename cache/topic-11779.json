Knowing that after the babe is<br/>\nborn we will probably be limited to what we can do and where we can go for <br/>\nawhile, we have been going to as many activities, field trips etc as possible.<br/>\nOne of the hs groups we participate with was offering some science classes.<br/>\nThey were 1 hr each (not too long) and would offer 3-6 hands on experiments.<br/>\nThe topic was to be gases. I thought, ok this has the potential to be a lot<br/>\nof fun and (in my mind I am thinking-- hey they might learn how some of this<br/>\nstuff works!)  I ask the kids if they want to go, I said it was an experiment<br/>\nclass and they said sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we go to the first class and I sit in.  And I am sitting there thinking, <br/>\ngee<br/>\nI wish I had a science teacher like this in school.  But my kids aren&#39;t in<br/>\nschool...She was fast pace, explained things well, funny personality but<br/>\nwell, kind of boring...even with the experiments...and a couple were really<br/>\ncool!  My dd kept looking back at me and I kept trying not to meet her<br/>\ngaze as I knew : 0 that she wanted to let me know how bored she was<br/>\nwith a heavy sigh and eye roll LOL.  Precious girl doesn&#39;t she know I know<br/>\nher so well?  As soon as the class was over I asked the boys if they <br/>\nwanted to come again. They said no.  I didn&#39;t even need to ask dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter class I asked the organizer if she had turned in my check yet,<br/>\nand if not could I give her a new check that covered the kids for the day.<br/>\nWell technically she was not supposed to do that. I assured her that<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t the teacher, she was really good, but my kids just weren&#39;t <br/>\ninto that kind of learning and some of the info was really above their<br/>\nheads (even though it was meant for their age range).  She did give<br/>\nme my check back and I gave her a new one, bless her heart!  Phew <br/>\nwe all walked out much relieved. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo as we sat in the car on the way home I asked the kids (mostly dd)<br/>\nwhy they didn&#39;t like the class.  She tells me its because they have done<br/>\nall that stuff at home.  I am incredulous.  Uh, when?  Well the first was<br/>\neasy, it was blowing up a baloon and discussing pressure.  They mess<br/>\nwith baloons all the time.  Well what about the water in the paper cup<br/>\nthat she turned upside down onto a piece of paper (and the cup sticks<br/>\nto the paper and no water comes out)?  &quot;We do that all the time when<br/>\nwe are letting the water out of the tub&quot;  they fill up some such thing<br/>\nplaying with suction, air etc.  So how about when you blew air through<br/>\na straw into plastic baggies and made the piece of plywood rise?  &quot;I<br/>\nsaw that in a book&quot; LOL.  OK OK I give up!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what did I get for my money?  ($30 just for the one class for 3).<br/>\nI learned that my kids don&#39;t separate &quot;science&quot; from life, that they <br/>\nare living it in their daily lives.  That you don&#39;t have to know the why<br/>\nof something to just know that it &quot;does&quot; (experiments).  One of the<br/>\nexperiments did lead to a longer conversation (could we lift the Twin<br/>\nTowers with air bags?).  And finally, my kids saw that once again,<br/>\nI would not force them to do something they didn&#39;t want to do.  I <br/>\nlovingly reminded them what a good mom I was and did they realise<br/>\nthat some moms would make their kids take the class (probably <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even ask if they were interested to start with)?  They couldn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand that and felt bad for the other kids.  (If I had been stuck<br/>\npaying for the class I would not have made them continue attending.<br/>\nI would have asked the instructor for a refund and if not &quot;sold&quot; my<br/>\nkids spaces at a discount rate to another family or worst case, just<br/>\neat the cost if I had to.  It was my fault for paying in advance, which<br/>\nis what they want you to do, but I could have just paid on the date, so <br/>\nnext time I won&#39;t pay in advance for anything iffy!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was a good lesson for us all the way around I guess.  My instinct<br/>\ntold me the class might not work out, even though I had thoroughly <br/>\nquizzed the organizer on the class/teacher etc.  So I stumbled, <br/>\nwe tried something that wasn&#39;t completely delighful and survived it &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nand are back to normal again LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11777,"nextTopicId":11798}}
