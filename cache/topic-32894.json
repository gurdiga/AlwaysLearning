[:-/]<br/>\n<br/>\nI see Mark and your point and do think that it could be a better time<br/>\nfor them as they get older.  In all honesty, the kids don&#39;t see grandma<br/>\nas the manipulator that I do and I really don&#39;t want them to see her<br/>\nlike that.

Keith&#39;s mom didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow why we wanted the kids to sleep with us.  Even when the kids  <br/>\nwere bigger, sometimes I&#39;d take the bedroom with Holly and Keith  <br/>\nwould be in the den with the boys.

It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like to be  <br/>\nwith Keith, but we were not ABOUT to have sex on a fold-out couch in  <br/>\nthe room next to his parents, and our kids were VERY likely to be  <br/>\nmore comfortable if they could hear, smell and touch someone familiar  <br/>\nin an unfamiliar house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when the kids got older, teens, things got really good with the  <br/>\ngrandparents.

So, basically nothing changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also say that your advice helped immensely a few weeks ago. <br/>\nGrandma had made ds (graham) feel really bad about himself by quizzing<br/>\nhim and pointing out his reading pace being slower than school kids. <br/>\nYou told me to explain to Graham why Grandma did that (she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand our learning philosophy, it&#39;s cause she cares and worries<br/>\nabout him).  Wow, what a difference that made in Grahams feelings about<br/>\nthe situation.  That advice really helped and he just said &quot;tell her not<br/>\nto do it again&quot;, which is why I sent the 2nd letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hence the 2nd letter,  I took the time ONLY because my son asked me<br/>\nto tell Grandma not to quiz him anymore.   She replied very defensively<br/>\n(she didn&#39;t want to&quot; insult my teaching methods&quot;...barf) but said she<br/>\nwould not do it again.   We haven&#39;t seen her since so I&#39;m not sure how<br/>\nit really went.  I&#39;m not expecting it to change her manipulative<br/>\npersonality but I did draw a line in the sand where Graham was<br/>\nconcerned.  Not that she&#39;ll have the pleasure to be alone with him again<br/>\nfor a long while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was one thing I had to learn.  I wasn&#39;t changing her.  If I was<br/>\nsending my kids to their house, I should have known that Grandma is the<br/>\nway she is  and do things that I may not approve of (like cut my sons<br/>\nhair, quiz him, tell my daughter she needs to go to church,school,<br/>\netc.).  So, I look at it as my bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I still remember where we were standing when she said &quot;You need to<br/>\n&gt; frustrate them more.&quot;  (Kirby and Marty.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t say &quot;Well, we brought them to see you!&quot;  I said something<br/>\n&gt; like life has enough natural frustrations without us making any up,<br/>\n&gt; or like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a riot...hysterical in fact!  I just read it to hubby and he too<br/>\nfound it hysterical !! I&#39;m usually pretty good w/ one liners (I<br/>\nbartended for years  [:-?] ) but I really just bite my tongue around<br/>\nher.

I&#39;ve been putting up with comments from my MIL and now my BIL and feel like I&#39;m up against the world with no support. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my emotions are escalated right now because I&#39;ve been fighting some local homeschooling battles and having to deal with really rude, judgemental people. But this issue with my BIL and husband started before all that started. It&#39;s just that now I can&#39;t see to get past my anger. Am I wrong to be mad? <br/>\n <br/>\nTara<br/>\nOur Unschooling Blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://heartschooling.blogspot.com\">http://heartschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nWorried about the environment?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com\">http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\nWorried about the economy?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
