I <br/>\nbelieve Sandra Dodd wrote a comment for the back cover of the book, <br/>\nrecommending it.  At any rate, I truly enjoyed the book and wanted to let others know <br/>\nmore about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said to a good friend last week, there are so many families I admire <br/>\nwhen I see how their families appear to function and how the children behave -- <br/>\neager to learn, interesting and interested in life, and, insecure person that I <br/>\nam (that likely many of us are), I wish I could be a little mouse in the <br/>\ncorner and observe one of these families on a daily basis for a while to really <br/>\nsee how they function, day to day, hour to hour. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is what I really enjoy about &quot;Homeschooling Reflections&quot; -- the way <br/>\nConnie Colten allows us into her family in such an intimate and honest way.  <br/>\nAnd what I learned was not the secret to perfect homeschooling or unschooling, <br/>\nbut rather, just that it works, not perfectly, but best, when we trust our <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in learning more about this book, you can visit <br/>\nConnie&#39;s website:<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane Shelton<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18883,"nextTopicId":18898}}
