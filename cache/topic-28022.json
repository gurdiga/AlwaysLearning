I am removing her from school formerly today and home (un) schooling her with my other two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe psychologist from school just called to ask if Lauren was coming in and I told her that with much thought I was removing Lauren and homeschooling her.  She asked about the kids curriculum and voiced her concerns about a visit she made here last week when she saw the kids eating breakfast at 10am and the 2 younger ones watching TV.  As if I needed explaining to this group, we are only 2-4 weeks into unschooling.   She then continued to voice her concerns and asked when I was schooling them and at what time we were sitting down with books.  She also expressed her concern at my working part time and doing this.  I told her that I was working one day a week and she then was worried that i wouldn&#39;t be able to afford this. I assured her that the house was stocked with food and I would never let my family go hungry.  She happens to be a nice person who was educated as a school teacher before she was a psychologist.  (Tada).<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested that she go online and research homeschooling to see the many types and avenues of homeschooling there are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is should I be concerned that she is bringing up all these concerns - i.e. will she do anything further with the school system?  Can she?  After reading the laws and guidelines, she can&#39;t.  And due to Lauren&#39;s illness, we have worked hand in hand with DCF (Dept of Children and Families) both voluntarily and involuntarily and they know us well.  So that won&#39;t bother me, but her questions did.  They sounded too much like my mother&#39;s and my father&#39;s and my aunt&#39;s (another schoolteacher) and my other aunt&#39;s (another special ed teacher) .  My fiancee reminds me that I need to learn how to not let them rattle me, but after 48 years of basically doing whatever I want, it still does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll comments welcome!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarole   Happy happy unschooler of Lauren (13)  Jonah (10) and Julia (7)<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n8:00? 8:25? 8:40?
