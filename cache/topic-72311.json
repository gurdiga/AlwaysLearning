She wanted to add an adjective to an existing object. The word she asked me to spell was &quot;unharmful&quot;. I spelled the word for her. As I expected, this word was not in the game&#39;s dictionary. What was interesting to me was that she had constructed this perfectly cromulent word, which seems to mean she has successfully abstracted some of the rules of prefixes and suffixes and how to add them to nouns to get an adjective.</p>\n\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Virginia</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72297,"nextTopicId":72299}}
