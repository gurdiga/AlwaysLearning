After<br/>\nthat trial, they let them get back to their lives and normal eating habits<br/>\nto see what would happen.  All of them went back to their weights of before,<br/>\nover different amounts of time.  Everyone they interviewed said they did not<br/>\ndo any dieting.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy own experience agrees with this idea but it also tells me that maybe if<br/>\nweight gain goes on for a certain amount of time (longer than this trial)<br/>\nthen the brain &#39;thinks&#39; that is what the body then needs.  And maybe that<br/>\namount of time is different for some, like women who bounce back to their<br/>\nold weight before childbirth while others carry more and more weight after<br/>\neach birth.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have a very, very similar story to Dina though and noticed just recently<br/>\nin a photo from around the &#39;actually getting sick because I had to eat Fish&#39;<br/>\ntime that I wasn&#39;t my usual thin self.  It was right about then, if I<br/>\nremember correctly my parents stopped making me eat certain things on a<br/>\ndaily basis, that rule continued on the holidays though.  I had to have a<br/>\ntablespoon size of everything.  My mother has told me she wanted me to try<br/>\nthings that she didn&#39;t make at home - thinking I then wouldn&#39;t be a picky<br/>\neater.  All my growing up years there was still the &#39;have to finish what you<br/>\ntook to eat&#39; rule.  I still slimmed down back down though.  From photos I<br/>\nhave I&#39;d say I was at my thinnest at around 16.  I don&#39;t know my fathers<br/>\nside of the family but my mothers side are all obviously on the thin side<br/>\nand still are.    <br/>\n <br/>\nI have not been what one would call thin since my first child was born when<br/>\nI was 28 (almost 14 yrs ago now).  I&#39;ve not worried over much about my<br/>\nweight gain but it still doesn&#39;t feel right to me and every once in awhile<br/>\nI&#39;ve exercised more to try to shift the weight which has never worked for<br/>\nvery long.  Around 10 years ago I started joining homeschool lists and the<br/>\nsubject of weight and health came up.  I realized then that this, what I<br/>\nfelt, extra weight I had was most probably a psychological issue from my<br/>\nchildhood and not because I wasn&#39;t eating right or getting enough exercise.<br/>\nAll my life before children my weight had been able to self regulate.

Any crowd of unschoolers shows the same <br/>\nwide variation in physique that any other crowd of the general population. I <br/>\nsuppose if we were being compared to a crowd of Olympic runners or fashion <br/>\nmodels or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, then we might be showing more mass <br/>\nbut so would any crowd of ordinary parents, kids and teenagers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that sometimes people suspect that we ignore or hide problems, that <br/>\nthe whole unschooling thing is too good to be true. Then when we do report <br/>\nhow we manage problems, tough moments, the times when our kids baffle or <br/>\ndistress us, in ways that do not resort to controlling or limiting or <br/>\nturning away from unschooling, the reaction can be unnecessarily &quot;just as I <br/>\nthought&quot; viscious - as if the absence of perfection equals complete failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to be slimmer, but I can tell you it&#39;s not what or how I eat. <br/>\nIt&#39;s how I don&#39;t exercise enough to overcome my genetics. I have been within <br/>\nthree pounds of the same weight, other than pregnancy, for around 12 years, <br/>\nwhich I slowly arrived at over three years after I quit going to the gym for <br/>\n(at least) 2 hours every single live long day. I think if I were simply <br/>\nconsuming too many calories, surely my weight would continue to rise. Jayn <br/>\nhas gotten pretty plump over the last year, and that follows the pattern <br/>\nthat both my mother and I did at that age - only Jayn is less plump and <br/>\nstarted older than either of us were if photos are any evidence. If she <br/>\ncontinues to follow the pattern she will lose it all over the course of <br/>\npuberty, especially if she continues to swim and dance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The story you mentioned, Sandra, originated<br/>\nwith me. The &quot;fat=happy&quot; magnet is actually an insert from a Tasty<br/>\nBite Indian food package, and it&#39;s referring to studies that have<br/>\nshown that low-fat diets correlate with depression. Originally it was<br/>\ntitled &quot;fat=happy?&quot; but my awesome friend whited-out the question<br/>\nmark. :p <br/>\n<br/>\nThe story I told was of reading a blog post by an unschooler about her<br/>\nskepticism about intuitive eating or &quot;unfooding&quot; as I&#39;ve heard some<br/>\nunschoolers call it.

Like: Adipose tissue in<br/>\nareas other than women&#39;s breasts is the result of uncontrolled and<br/>\nunhealthy and psychologically dysfunctional eating. Thin people do not<br/>\neat unhealthily and do not exhibit psychologically dysfunctional<br/>\neating. &quot;Fat&quot; is defined as anything but stick thin. Children are<br/>\ninherently bad and self-destructive and have no self-knowledge. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure you could come up with some more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ridiculousness of her targeting your family as evidence for her<br/>\ntheory aside, she&#39;s right that intuitive eating doesn&#39;t guarantee thin<br/>\nchildren, although she&#39;s wrong about why that is, and she&#39;s wrong to<br/>\nassume that the opposite -- controlling food -- will necessarily<br/>\nresult in thin, healthy people. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn is wrong too. Yes, there is such a thing as psychologically<br/>\ndysfunctional eating behavior that is caused by control and<br/>\nexpectations and judgment. But even in the absence of those things,<br/>\npeople will still not all look exactly like the current cultural<br/>\naesthetic ideal. The fact that he&#39;s wrong *doesn&#39;t make food freedom<br/>\nand intuitive eating wrong*. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that controlling someone&#39;s food source doesn&#39;t (except by<br/>\nstarvation) guarantee thinness -- or any shape or size for that matter<br/>\n-- and intuitive eating doesn&#39;t guarantee it either. But control<br/>\n*will* guarantee mental and emotional issues with food to some degree,<br/>\nand intuitive eating will make a normal relationship with food much<br/>\neasier to achieve. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130027733,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: the tale of how I kept someone from unschooling","postDate":"1233272245","msgId":41604,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsdGVqbCszdTczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBGNzhFN0RBLTIwNzktNEY5RC05MkQ0LTQxQzNGNjA0NUFERkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41582,"nextInTopic":41605,"prevInTime":41603,"nextInTime":41605,"topicId":41555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Then I got pregnant.   <br/>\nThen over the next five years I had three babies, all (sadly and  <br/>\nfrustratingly) by cesarean, and a few years later I broke my other leg.<br/>\n#4  I weigh as much as Oprah Winfrey.  She&#39;s wildly ashamed and noisy  <br/>\nabout it.  I&#39;m busy helping people unschool.<br/>\n#5  There are current photos of my kids at the bottom of this page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/kids\">http://sandradodd.com/kids</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Marty and Kirby have at one time or another been pudgier, and  <br/>\nthen got tall.  So what?<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT IF my kids were &quot;fat&quot;?  They aren&#39;t.<br/>\nIf they were, would that &quot;prove&quot; unschooling didn&#39;t work?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a kid is thin, is it because parents limit foods or force them to  <br/>\neat certain foods or any other thing like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t want to unschool, it&#39;s easier for them to look  <br/>\naround and blame something or someone, than to say &quot;I&#39;ve thought about  <br/>\nit but I don&#39;t want to,&quot; or &quot;I tried to understand it, but I can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Holly:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/kdk_0253.jpg\">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/kdk_0253.jpg</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/martyparty049.jpg\">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/martyparty049.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShe has larger breasts than I had when I was her age. She&#39;s wearing  <br/>\nsmaller jeans than I wore at her age. When I was her age I weighed 120  <br/>\nlbs. MAYBE that means she&#39;ll gain weight when she&#39;s in her 30&#39;s and  <br/>\nolder too. Maybe it doesn&#39;t. What I DO know is that she eats better  <br/>\nthan I ever ate in my life, and she knows what foods do what to her.  <br/>\nShe never eats just because it&#39;s time. She doesn&#39;t eat things she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like. She likes things many adults don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my lunatic stalkers (or my lunatic stalker, if they&#39;re all the  <br/>\nsame person) once got angry and wrote that Keith was an ogre and Kirby  <br/>\nwas a blimp. Somehow I guess that made her feel better.   But  <br/>\nanyway...  it seemed silly and it seemed very false, seeing as how  <br/>\nespecially Marty and Holly are pretty lithe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41713,"nextTopicId":41717}}
