I wish I could say that about myself as a kid, but I can&#39;t. It warms my heart to see him playing and interacting in such a natural way. He is so much less afraid to &quot;be himself&quot; than I was as a kid. I would feel pressure to conform. He&#39;s fine to say &quot;no, I don&#39;t want to do this&quot; even if his friends are. It doesn&#39;t mean he is superior, but he doesn&#39;t feel &quot;less than&quot; if he doesn&#39;t conform to the group, either.

Even my super-introverted daughter has a muuuuuuch broader range of regular social experiences than if she were in school.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids knew a much greater range of ages, and knew people from different parts of the country, and some from other countries.  I hardly did, as a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I grew up in a smallish town where anglos (any English speakers not native to the area) were 15% of the school population, native Americans (Pueblo kids) were 15% and the other 70% were northern New Mexico hispanic kids, most of whose parents spoke Spanish and English, and grandparents spoke only Spanish.     I had a rich mix of friends, and never had an anglo boyfriend until I was in my 20&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; friends came from La Leche League, Pokemon games, the gaming store, and homeschooling groups.  We were in Albuquerque, a city big enough to be more (voluntarily) segregated, and in central New Mexico the Indian kids go to their own schools and aren&#39;t much in town (not that my kids were in school in town anyway). So their range was as big, but different, from what I grew up with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another thing to remember.  My kids can&#39;t possibly grow up as I did. Those days are gone.  That town has changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents enrich a child&#39;s life, the child&#39;s life is richer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"Robert and Colleen &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Do unschooled kids end up feeling superior?","postDate":"1361910661","msgId":70707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0NUQyRTQ1LUUzQzktNDlERC04Mzc2LTIyODlDMjBFMkVDQ0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtnajNpYSs0YzhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtnajNpYSs0YzhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70704,"nextInTopic":70709,"prevInTime":70706,"nextInTime":70708,"topicId":70694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****The unschooling kids I ve met don t have that we all go to the best school in town attitude.**** I agree!

There are<br/>\nfrequently times when I look at someone else&#39;s life and experience waves of<br/>\nimmense gratitude for the way my parents brought me up.

Beyond the gratitude I already listed, some the ones<br/>\nspecific to unschooling are - I am grateful for my parents to teach me the<br/>\nlesson of not doing what others say just because they say to, of the<br/>\nconstant flow of resources they worked hard to provide, of the way my brain<br/>\nworks now and sees connection, of the time I had to develop my passions, of<br/>\ntheir involvement, vigilance, hard work, resourcefulness, and the fact that<br/>\nthey put our family, our happiness, and our relationships above other<br/>\nthings, such as test scores and grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also grateful that my mother, in particular, spends so much of her<br/>\ntime on email lists, facebook pages, organization boards, and answering<br/>\nphone calls to new-to-homeschooling parents. She saves a lot of children&#39;s<br/>\nlives.

I do wonder how this culture will change as there are more and more<br/>\ngenerations away from the schooling alternative. I think gratitude is a<br/>\nreally, really important characteristic that is more prevalent in an<br/>\nunschooler&#39;s life, it walks hand in hand with optimism, and is hard work.

I am not able to frame it very well as a specific question either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband  had a recent interaction with a  group of individuals who have been a to a particular alternative education setting (a sort of open school) . He felt that they were snooty, felt that they were making an effort to prove themselves superior due to their educational setting . There was a lot of mainstream school bashing going on there and he felt that they did not consider the feelings of those who might have been to school. His own education and mine have been mainstream. He felt it was in poor taste that they felt the need to establish they were &quot;better&quot; educated due to the radical teaching methodologies that they have been exposed to. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt that some how we would end up imparting the message to our children ( very young now and not yet school going age) that our way of life was &quot;better&quot; than what our friends chose for their children. And while it very well may be &quot;better&quot; which is why we choose it, that telling our children that it is &quot;better&quot; may lead to problems later on. (A bit ironic since I pretty much have to field questions about school and how that &quot;school is better&quot; on a daily basis so I personally think its quite the reverse).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants our children to learn to get along with all kinds of people or know to handle all kinds of situations especially .What he worries is a sense of &quot;superiority&quot; attitude that our children might acquire because I genuinely believe that this way of living and learning is better for them. Additionally some of my family members have expressed to him that homeschooling is elitist and that we are eliminating opportunities for our children to mingle with &quot;all natures of people&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of unschooling as a privilege, something that I want to work hard towards maintaining, But my husband&#39;s concern made it sound  like some sort of belief system that would make my children NOT fit in. Kind of like saying &quot;so much individuality that you won&#39;t be able to get along with other people and know how to connect because you know that you are better than others&quot;. While I KNOW that&#39;s the very opposite of what I believe to be unschooling, but I am struggling with explaining  it out to my husband. Part of the problem is that we do not have access to many grown unschoolers.  And the unschoolers that we have access to seem aloof, generally less social than what my husband is used to seeing which worries him more. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason my husband fears that &quot;Unschooling&quot; will lead his children down a path that might get lonely because of the fact that they will think they are better than others. He wants our children to be likable. He wonders if grown unschoolers think they are too good for the rest of the world? While I don&#39;t have a crystal ball, my hope is that if I radically unschool my children would grow up to be inquisitive, kind people better than if I put them in school and that would understand that what they experienced was a privilege and would look at it that way only and not as something to be snobbish about. I believe that more so since I have met many ivy league/prep school snobs and even the ivy league credentials and smartness couldn&#39;t make up for the lack of humility..</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70621,"nextTopicId":19162}}
