My 14 yo is working full time with <br/>\nhis dad for a few weeks  (making more than I could *ever* make).  In his <br/>\nfree time, he&#39;s building mountain bike trails and jumps, building a new <br/>\nbike from the frame up, playing soccer, getting ready for baseball season, <br/>\nlearning about photography and learning how to use Adobe Photoshop, <br/>\nwatching TV, surfing the mountain bike web sites, downloading music.  The <br/>\nonly one of those that I&#39;m interested in knowing more about is the <br/>\nphotography and Photoshop stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did ask about making web sites the other day.  I told him I could show <br/>\nhim the basics, and how to learn from other people&#39;s sites, and that he <br/>\nneeded to think about what he might want to put on his site.  We&#39;ll see if <br/>\nthat goes any farther.  I hope it does.  I&#39;ve always had trouble finding <br/>\nareas we were both interested in.  Oh, and he&#39;s started letting me read to <br/>\nhim again, over the last few months.  I really missed that.  We&#39;re doing <br/>\nThe Lord of the Rings again.  He doesn&#39;t remember any of it, because I read <br/>\nit to him when he was 6 or 7.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] What we do","postDate":"1013552905","msgId":4698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDkwMWMxYjQxNCQ5NzEwZjBlMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGY0LjE2YTUyNjUyLjI5OWFkNGQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4693,"nextInTopic":4703,"prevInTime":4697,"nextInTime":4699,"topicId":4691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: KathrynJB@aol.com ...

They are 11 and 8 and had never seen it before.  We had gone on <br/>\nthe Tower of Terror at Disney this fall, so they knew the name, and <br/>\nthe voice of Rod Sterling.<br/>\nThey loved it.  It was  about a guy on a wagon train with a dying son <br/>\nwho went to look for water and was transported to present day 1960&#39;s.<br/>\nHe ended up meeting people in a small desert town and learning about <br/>\nmodern medicine and getting some for his son and going back.  <br/>\nOfcoarse all the people in town thought he was crazy.<br/>\nAnyway, that is stuff i consider &quot;educational&quot;.  I now get that same <br/>\nfeeling I use to get when they would work in a workbook a few years <br/>\nago, when they are doing things that are just *cool*.  I can&#39;t help <br/>\nbut think that some things are just really good to come across. (the <br/>\nworkbooks aren&#39;t on that list anymore).  <br/>\nI have a friend that is in charge of the childrens theater(adult <br/>\ncollege students, doing childrens theater) at our local university.  <br/>\nWe just went and saw her production of &quot;The Prince, the Pig and the <br/>\nPeevish Princess&quot;  I believe the playbill said it was first played in <br/>\nnew Mexico and some Shakespeare theater.  It was hilarious!!<br/>\nMy kids are also in a childrens theater program and they are now <br/>\ndoing The Wizard of OZ.  I&#39;m in charge of costumes with another lady <br/>\nand have been making the monkey costumes latley. My dd is a <br/>\nmunchkin.  She got the part of &#39;city father #1&#39;, but being the <br/>\nfeminist that she is, persuaded them to let her be a city mother.  <br/>\nShe has to say the &quot;morally, ethically, ....&quot;line.  My ds is a common <br/>\nmunchkin who has to sing and dance and he&#39;s a flying monkey.  It&#39;s <br/>\nhis first production, and my daughters 7th or 8th. (she loves <br/>\ntheater).  I also have a 5 and 2 yo.  They&#39;ve been getting some <br/>\npretty good daddy bonding time, with us being so busy with rehearsals <br/>\nand costume making.<br/>\nAnyway, that is some of the stuff we *do*.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What we do","postDate":"1013545680","msgId":4691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0LjE2YTUyNjUyLjI5OWFkNGQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4693,"prevInTime":4690,"nextInTime":4692,"topicId":4691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good point about talking about what we don t do in unschooling a lot.

(Web site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mv.com/org/sf27/)\">http://www.mv.com/org/sf27/)</a>  I <br/>\nwent once when I was in college.  We spent some time yesterday looking at the <br/>\nweb site, which has a great Discussion Board. We read the threads about what <br/>\nto take, and started a list of our own. We decided we wanted to get there <br/>\nearly so we could get decent seats, but we didn&#39;t want to send the night <br/>\noutside in the cold. We looked over the movies titles, and checked out <br/>\ndescriptions. He is SO excited!  (Me too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, his father wouldn&#39;t consider this &quot;educational,&quot; even though he <br/>\nthinks it&#39;s great we&#39;re doing it. We&#39;re having lots of conflicts about <br/>\nunschooling, because he thinks Julian should be actively engaged in academics <br/>\n6 hours or more a day. He won&#39;t read anything about unschooling.  Argh... <br/>\nSorry, this turned into a venting session.  Juls is doing SO well, and his <br/>\ndad just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4676,"nextTopicId":4707}}
