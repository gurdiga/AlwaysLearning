When people say unkind things, it&#39;s usually not because they are true, but because someone said those unkind words to them and the don&#39;t know what to do with them. Imagine an unkind word as a piece of coal. When they say an unkind word to another person, they are trying to have that piece of coal to them. What might be another way to handle that coal?&quot;.... And she can give her suggestions... Throw it away, or tell the person,&quot;please don&#39;t pass this on to me, I don&#39;t want it.&quot; or whatever. Let her know that this doesn&#39;t excuse what Jacob said, but it explains that it&#39;s not about her. And that there will be people that we come across throughout our lives that will say unkind things (pass on the coal).

Since my daughter is an introvert (like both of us) and an only child we try to let her play with whatever kids are available as long as she wants to play with them. The boy is mostly fine, a bit goofy and whiny, like lots of kids but they played together pretty well. He has blamed my daughter for some things recently that weren&#39;t her fault which is annoying but not too serious and we talk to our daughter about all these situations. I just found out that he told her she can&#39;t know stuff and doesn&#39;t know how to read and can&#39;t learn because she doesn&#39;t do worksheets. This is pretty frustrating since my daughter can read but is not confident about it. She also is taller than him, better at certain physical things from gymnastics, and enjoys learning about animals, etc. which seems to bother him sometimes. I do have sympathy for his situation because when he is here with his dad he is always going to activities, church events, even working out at the gym and he just seems to need to chill. And if we tell the dad anything about the kids he immediately reprimands his son even in front of all of us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">Another aspect to this is that we are not religious and their family is. I told them that we are not religious pretty soon after they moved in because it&#39;s just easier to get out of the way. (For reference, my husband and I both grew up in evangelical churches and met at bible college where we both have degrees from so it is not for lack of knowledge that we are not christians.) This hasn&#39;t been a big deal although we have been invited to watch The Shack movie and my daughter was recently invited to attend VBS. She seems interested and I don&#39;t really mind her going because we talk about any experiences we have but I&#39;m hesitant to take her because I don&#39;t feel like I trust the situation to go well.</span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">I guess I&#39;m looking for some perspective because I feel like my anger at religiousness is mucking up my thoughts on how to deal with the comments he said about learning to my daughter. We have talked about how families all do different things and how there are so many ways to learn about things and how just because someone does things different or believes in god doesn&#39;t mean they are bad. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m almost more mad that their son treats my daughter meanly yet I speculate that they are feeling better about themselves because they go to church and check off all the acceptable societal parenting boxes. I do realize this is my hang up and I&#39;m working on it.</span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">What can I talk about with my daughter to mitigate the feelings that come up when another child tells her this stuff? She is pretty sensitive so even if she doesn&#39;t really believe it she will have a hard time understanding why someone would even say those things and want to talk about that over and over. Thanks.</span></p><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-347198795yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78019,"nextTopicId":78048}}
