It also imposes conclusions about what&#39;s possible and what isn&#39;t. Exploration is about trying things, seeing what happens, drawing conclusions, adjusting theories, trying some more. And repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of exploration isn&#39;t learning the right way (that mom or dad knows already) but for kids to try things out that intrigue them and make their own unique connections to build an understanding of how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the world doesn&#39;t cooperate with theories ;-) IT&#39;s frustrating and in that moment, what kids need most is compassion and perhaps distraction with something else to help them disconnect. (Depends on the child. That&#39;s where getting to know your kids comes in :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes kids are so involved they don&#39;t realize how hungry or tired they are. Best is being aware to tend to that before kids get to that point. If it&#39;s slipped by, then, again, compassion and helping them switch gears.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223431769,"authorName":"ftb2_ss","from":"&quot;ftb2_ss&quot; &lt;gregandrene@...&gt;","profile":"ftb2_ss","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Frustration and expression","postDate":"1329330588","msgId":65581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpoZ3RpcytpcWdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpoZHBpMStlZjQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65554,"nextInTopic":65584,"prevInTime":65580,"nextInTime":65582,"topicId":65539,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********* I would have explained that it just doesn t work that way, and suggest and demonstrate (once) how to use more than one piece to get them to stand","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1538284772\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;madh4ofwaipu&quot; &lt;megan2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; .......<br/>\n&gt; He seemed enraged that the single sheet would not stand up on it&#39;s own (like a solid box with sides would).<br/>\n&gt; I realize my mistake in wanting to do what ever he wanted for him as it was his learning experience.
