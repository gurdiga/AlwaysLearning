Believe me, there are dedicated people out<br/>\nthere who love animals, are good businesspersons, and have great people<br/>\nskills, and if you can find one, hang on to her/him! I don&#39;t have or want<br/>\nthe business skills, and so never pursued my own practice, but I burned out<br/>\non animals. It&#39;s taken a year to enjoy them again and I actually own two<br/>\ndogs now. For the last three years I worked in a high-volume<br/>\ngeneral/specialty/emergency/24 hour hospital and you have to be an<br/>\nadrenaline junkie. It&#39;s much more business and dealing with people than it<br/>\nis loving animals and that&#39;s what I try to impress on young people who want<br/>\nto go into the profession. I also tell them they *must* work in a practice<br/>\nbefore they commit. It helps to weed out the idealistic ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiring an office manager? Even single-person practices have one, along with<br/>\na couple of receptionists, a couple of techs, and a kennel person. That&#39;s<br/>\nminimum. Starting salaries for associates are often in the $40K range, and<br/>\nit&#39;s the rare vet, owner *or* associate, who can ever make over $100K.<br/>\nHappens occasionally now, but the ones I know who are well off have other<br/>\nsources of income, or work two jobs. So don&#39;t go into it for the money! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I talk with teens (mostly girls) that want to veterinarians when they grow<br/>\n </span></blockquote>up. I ask why they want to be vets. Inevitably they answer, &quot;Because I just<br/>\nLOOOOOVE animals!&quot; It&#39;s hard to explain how the time you actually spend<br/>\nPLAYING with the animals is very small---most of their time will be<br/>\ninflicting pain on their patients. They hardly ever see healthy, happy<br/>\npooches that smother them with kisses. Of course there&#39;s all the paperwork<br/>\n(unless you&#39;re interested in hiring an office manager to share in your<br/>\nprofits) and all the bitching from patients about how high your prices are.<br/>\nThere&#39;s the tremendous expense of starting a practice (before or after you<br/>\npay off those student loans?)---and then, after working all day on ugly,<br/>\nsick<br/>\nanimals, you get to come home to your own critters----which you&#39;re really<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to deal with because the LAST thing you want to see at the end of<br/>\nthe day is ANOTHER DOG!&lt;&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6373,"nextTopicId":6377}}
