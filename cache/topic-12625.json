We&#39;ve been having great spring-like weather<br/>\nhere lately.  Really, truly, amazingly nice.  Last year at this time, it was<br/>\nraining every day and we were inches deep in mud.  So I&#39;m doubly grateful<br/>\nevery time the sun comes out in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, my son has been fighting a stomache bug, so going outside to<br/>\nplay was out.  But we had a great day, too.  Tim still had some fever, but<br/>\nwas feeling so much better today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe sorted all of Tim&#39;s coins into the boxes that you sent (thanks!),<br/>\nlabelled the sections, and made a list of all the countries he has<br/>\nrepresented (88, in the final count!!!).  And we spent hours sitting in the<br/>\nsunny living room paging through coin books trying to identify three elusive<br/>\ncoins without obvious country names on them (Morocco, Tunisia, and Croatia).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took breaks to watch all the videos he&#39;s almost outgrown and hasn&#39;t seen<br/>\nin ages.  I haven&#39;t had this much fun with a sick child, ever!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Wonderful rainy day","postDate":"1046383798","msgId":12625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NC5iYmMyZTc3LjJiOGZlNmI2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12664,"prevInTime":12624,"nextInTime":12626,"topicId":12625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We had such a wonderful day today.
