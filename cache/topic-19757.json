I really want it to be a great day for everyone so I<br/>\n  &gt; want <br/>\n  &gt; to be ready to handle anything.  I&#39;d appreciate any help I can get.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;  Thanks.  Heidi<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Heidi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m originally from Canada, and though I haven&#39;t been to Canada&#39;s<br/>\n  Wonderland in a long time--like over ten years--I now live in<br/>\n  Southern California and have passes for my son Ben (who&#39;s now 4) to<br/>\n  Disneyland, and with Nick (who&#39;s now 1) to Legoland, and Universal<br/>\n  Studios.  We love going to these places because it&#39;s such a fun<br/>\n  family day, and they usually have rides/shows/activities that appeal<br/>\n  to both small kids and adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My advice is to have a good stroller that can hold a lot of stuff. <br/>\n  You won&#39;t have to carry it, you can leave it on the stroller.  If<br/>\n  small kids get sleepy, they have a place to crash.  When we first<br/>\n  started going, I was wary of leaving the stroller to go on a ride or<br/>\n  to a show, worried that someone might steal my bag or my stuff.  But<br/>\n  the fact is, at these places there are so many strollers and bags,<br/>\n  and everyone is leaving them to go on rides.  They even have stroller<br/>\n  parking areas where you can &quot;park&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We always try to do the kids rides first thing while they (and the<br/>\n  grown-ups) have lots of energy and they are fresh.  I try to bring<br/>\n  some snacks and some little (pocket sized) toys for the kids to play<br/>\n  with while waiting in line.  It might be good to think up some fun<br/>\n  word games or other activities to do in case you get stuck waiting<br/>\n  for a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  After lunch, my kids always get a little draggy, so this is when we<br/>\n  try to do a show, or a longish sit-down ride so the kids (and<br/>\n  grown-ups) can have a rest.  For example, we always do the back-lot<br/>\n  studio tour at Universal Studios near the end of the day.  It is<br/>\n  about an hour long, and is interesting for both kids and adults. <br/>\n  I&#39;ve nursed Nick on this ride many times.  Ben&#39;s fallen asleep on it<br/>\n  many times.  So if Canada&#39;s Wonderland has a kind of slower ride like<br/>\n  this,  it may be a good one for when the kids get a little pooped.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Did I mention to bring snacks?  No one has fun if they&#39;re<br/>\n  grumpy-hungry, (adults included).  If they give you trouble with<br/>\n  bringing food in, just say it&#39;s for the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even if your kids are out of diapers, I would bring some wet wipes. <br/>\n  Chances are you or the kids will be eating something sticky, and<br/>\n  touching everything--they are just handy to have.  Maybe you already<br/>\n  do this, but I&#39;d throw in changes of clothes for the younger kids,<br/>\n  just in case.  You never know when they&#39;ll fall in a fountain, or<br/>\n  throw up, or have a diaper blow out. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t remember if Wonderland has characters?  If they do, you might<br/>\n  want to get some blank books ahead of time.  I know older kids love<br/>\n  to go all over Disneyland and get autographs from Mickey, Donald,<br/>\n  Goofy, and all the characters.  Disneyland charges an arm and a leg<br/>\n  for the autograph books, and you can get them much cheaper outside<br/>\n  the park.  Don&#39;t know if your kids would be into that though.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I try to remember that the reason I am there is to have fun.  It is<br/>\n  easy to get really hyped up, stressed out, and feel ripped off,<br/>\n  because you are spending a fair amount of money.  I think it is best<br/>\n  to start the day with a focus of having fun as a family, even if you<br/>\n  only make it on one or two rides.  It isn&#39;t about how many rides you<br/>\n  can go on.  You are there to have fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, and bring your camera...we too often forget ours!   <br/>\n<br/>\n  And don&#39;t forget to check where you parked.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope that helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jonell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        <br/>\n              <br/>\n  __________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Friends.

She<br/>\n*loves* roller coasters.  I read her your email she had a couple things to<br/>\nsay.  The bridge by the mountain is a good meeting spot.  If you just say<br/>\n&quot;the mountain&quot;, you&#39;ll never find one another because it&#39;s way too big.  ;-)<br/>\nShe also recommends that the kids get a wristband near the entrance.  At<br/>\nleast the older ones who will be big enough to ride the bigger rides.  That<br/>\nway they don&#39;t have to keep getting height checks at each ride station, they<br/>\ncan just show their wristband and walk right on.  Drinks & snacks are a good<br/>\nidea, food is expensive.  But you can&#39;t leave without getting a funnel cake!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s great that you&#39;re going with another family &#39;cause then you can split<br/>\nup if the older kids want to spend some time on the bigger rides.  My only<br/>\nother tip is to try to relax and follow the kids&#39; leads.  If they want to do<br/>\nthe same ride over and over, it&#39;s okay.

Heidi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Heidi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m originally from Canada, and though I haven&#39;t been to Canada&#39;s<br/>\nWonderland in a long time--like over ten years--I now live in<br/>\nSouthern California and have passes for my son Ben (who&#39;s now 4) to<br/>\nDisneyland, and with Nick (who&#39;s now 1) to Legoland, and Universal<br/>\nStudios.  We love going to these places because it&#39;s such a fun<br/>\nfamily day, and they usually have rides/shows/activities that appeal<br/>\nto both small kids and adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is to have a good stroller that can hold a lot of stuff. <br/>\nYou won&#39;t have to carry it, you can leave it on the stroller.  If<br/>\nsmall kids get sleepy, they have a place to crash.  When we first<br/>\nstarted going, I was wary of leaving the stroller to go on a ride or<br/>\nto a show, worried that someone might steal my bag or my stuff.  But<br/>\nthe fact is, at these places there are so many strollers and bags,<br/>\nand everyone is leaving them to go on rides.  They even have stroller<br/>\nparking areas where you can &quot;park&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe always try to do the kids rides first thing while they (and the<br/>\ngrown-ups) have lots of energy and they are fresh.  I try to bring<br/>\nsome snacks and some little (pocket sized) toys for the kids to play<br/>\nwith while waiting in line.  It might be good to think up some fun<br/>\nword games or other activities to do in case you get stuck waiting<br/>\nfor a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch, my kids always get a little draggy, so this is when we<br/>\ntry to do a show, or a longish sit-down ride so the kids (and<br/>\ngrown-ups) can have a rest.  For example, we always do the back-lot<br/>\nstudio tour at Universal Studios near the end of the day.  It is<br/>\nabout an hour long, and is interesting for both kids and adults. <br/>\nI&#39;ve nursed Nick on this ride many times.  Ben&#39;s fallen asleep on it<br/>\nmany times.  So if Canada&#39;s Wonderland has a kind of slower ride like<br/>\nthis,  it may be a good one for when the kids get a little pooped.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention to bring snacks?  No one has fun if they&#39;re<br/>\ngrumpy-hungry, (adults included).  If they give you trouble with<br/>\nbringing food in, just say it&#39;s for the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if your kids are out of diapers, I would bring some wet wipes. <br/>\nChances are you or the kids will be eating something sticky, and<br/>\ntouching everything--they are just handy to have.  Maybe you already<br/>\ndo this, but I&#39;d throw in changes of clothes for the younger kids,<br/>\njust in case.  You never know when they&#39;ll fall in a fountain, or<br/>\nthrow up, or have a diaper blow out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember if Wonderland has characters?  If they do, you might<br/>\nwant to get some blank books ahead of time.  I know older kids love<br/>\nto go all over Disneyland and get autographs from Mickey, Donald,<br/>\nGoofy, and all the characters.  Disneyland charges an arm and a leg<br/>\nfor the autograph books, and you can get them much cheaper outside<br/>\nthe park.  Don&#39;t know if your kids would be into that though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to remember that the reason I am there is to have fun.  It is<br/>\neasy to get really hyped up, stressed out, and feel ripped off,<br/>\nbecause you are spending a fair amount of money.  I think it is best<br/>\nto start the day with a focus of having fun as a family, even if you<br/>\nonly make it on one or two rides.  It isn&#39;t about how many rides you<br/>\ncan go on.  You are there to have fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and bring your camera...we too often forget ours!   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t forget to check where you parked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
