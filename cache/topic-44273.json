It never seemed like a big<br/>\ndeal to me.

Hard<br/>\nto pick out favorite bits from such <br/>\na great post by but I think for me it might have to be &#39;other people will<br/>\nhave to come to their own epiphanies.  <br/>\nReally spoke to me when I read that.  Maybe here&#39;s why...<br/>\n <br/>\nYesterday, ds 14 now, was feeling very strongly about people &#39;not being able<br/>\nto see outside the box&#39;.  I told him I <br/>\nused to feel a lot like that too about some things with people and would get<br/>\nso frustrated sometimes.  I explained <br/>\nhow I went from getting so frustrated to sadness for those people, thanks to<br/>\nhis dad, and now I&#39;m more in the <br/>\nacceptance part.  Having a close relative that struggles so unbelievably<br/>\nhard, it feels to me, with any new thought or<br/>\nidea has probably been a large part of my journey to this point.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think maybe I&#39;m a visual person because I explained it similar to this...<br/>\nWe pictured a certain person we know<br/>\nall tightly but very comfortably and happily boxed up.  They are totally in<br/>\ntheir comfortable zone and for some reason,<br/>\nmaybe past negative experiences they get very *scared* when that box starts<br/>\nto move or expand even a little bit.  <br/>\nSome of us have learned what a good thing this can be and even look forward<br/>\nto it happening again but not them.  <br/>\nThey just can&#39;t come to understand how much happier and better things are<br/>\noutside of such a tight confining<br/>\nplace they now live in.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI just thought this from reading this morning...  maybe some people need to<br/>\nbe dumped out of the box to get it,<br/>\nsome can only handle the tiniest little seeds of thought at a time and some<br/>\nno matter what are never going to <br/>\naccept that the sunshine and happiness is so much more incredible outside of<br/>\ntheir little boxes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJoy  <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com [mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Sandra Dodd<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:04 AM<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Cultural Unschooler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The proof is in the living!

And what happens is a wish to <br/>\nlive somewhere we don&#39;t... almost like nostalgia, except for never <br/>\nhaving been there or experienced it.

Honestly my <br/>\nthoughts about unschooling never waver, but I could easily never do any <br/>\nof what I think about it.

The other day I was baking a cake and David got back from the grocery store and had to deal with the leaking coolant on the car and needed help putting the groceries away. I was up to my elbows in batter and asked Simon and Linnaea if they could help. They both came in and put all the groceries away and went back to what they were doing. It was so sweet, so not coercive, so not eye-rolling. Just this generous gift of service. It came with an epiphany, an underscoring of these unschooling side effects that I see and read about from other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you say, the proof is in the living! The rightness, the evidence, the closeness, the joy, those are all found in this life. You can read about them, but to experience them you have to get down on your hands and knees and play and hang out and tell stories and cuddle and talk and share and be willing to listen and to apologize and to work to make it better. And if you can do that without any other intention that enjoying being with them, without any alterior motives, it plays out in ways that nothing else that I&#39;ve ever seen does. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jenny C &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe proof is in the living!
