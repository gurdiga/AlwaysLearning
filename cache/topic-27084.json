I do not want to impose my will <br/>\non my daughter - I think if nothing else that will undermine her self-<br/>\nconfidence.  I want her to know that I support - and will continue to <br/>\nsupport - her decisions.  I also think I do need to remove myself <br/>\nsomewhat from the school stresses.  I&#39;m sure my actions at times have <br/>\nonly served to emphasize that there is homework to do, when what I <br/>\nreally want is to provide her with the fun, peaceful home life that <br/>\nshe needs and we all want.  I&#39;m too quick to give her &quot;advice,&quot; when <br/>\nwhat I really need to be doing is giving her hugs, rubbing her back, <br/>\nhelping her to relax, etc.<br/>\nThe issue really isn&#39;t the work - she has no problem with the work <br/>\nbeing too difficult.  The anxiety/stress comes from having to do more <br/>\nwork when she&#39;s spent a lot of her free time in school already and <br/>\njust wants to do her own thing.  She also has a strong need to please <br/>\neveryone else, i.e. teachers.  <br/>\nI need to let her own her decision completely and the best way to do <br/>\nthat is by my not investing myself in her school work.  It&#39;s her <br/>\ndecision to go to school, it&#39;s hers whether to do the homework, hers <br/>\nwhether to stay in school.  I love her and respect her no matter what <br/>\nthose decisions mightultimately be.<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m stepping back, letting her own her decision and making sure <br/>\nI&#39;m not contributing to the problem.  Instead, I will just love her, <br/>\nmake it clear that choosing to do something else is always an option, <br/>\nand be proud of the wonderful person she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much,<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27064,"nextTopicId":27078}}
