I&#39;d used up all my characters and was trying to keep things short. As well as sweet. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thought about commenting on my comment but didn&#39;t want to wear out my welcome. Your words here help me clarify my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Conventional parents usually don&#39;t think they are being disrespectful or <br/>\n&gt; unkind, and they often think they are using only gentle punishments, <br/>\n&gt; referred to as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I revised it a teeny bit for my own blog and made sure that this part read as:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Other parents have &quot;rules&quot; but really use them as guidelines for their children&#39;s behaviour rather than opportunities to be authoritarian or punitive. They may, however, think &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; consequences are a fair way to deal with a child&#39;s behaviour, not realizing that those are often punitive in their own right. eg) a child forgets his lunch and goes hungry as a result... a &quot;natural&quot; consequence; or a child leaves his Lego on the floor for a week, so it gets piled in a bag and put on the top shelf in the closet ... a &quot;logical&quot; consequence that takes away something the child cares deeply about.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat &quot;however&quot; I added in front of natural and logical consequences seems small but it really needed to be there the first time around. Most parents simply don&#39;t understand that there are choices. Their intentions are good but fall short because they read the conventional parenting material that is most readily available, not realizing that it&#39;s just a variation on a theme (punitive).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I graduated with my first degree, I worked in a behavioural residential program. There was even a token economy and it was &quot;lock-up&quot;. The &quot;clientele&quot; were mostly street kids who were there by court order (at high risk for harming themselves or others) and did not respond well to the &quot;point system&quot;. Some of the child care workers were stuck on the point card (very behavioural), giving points for conforming to the rules and taking away points for asserting independence, and the kids hated them (the workers). Other child care workers stuck the point card in their back pocket for the shift and gave a lump sum at the end of the day. These were the workers that the kids loved and responded to. Not because of the lump sum (which they got to spend in the &quot;store&quot;). Because of the relationship because that is how these folks worked with the kids (and I learned a great deal from them). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the piece that I really wanted to add in there. It&#39;s all about relationship. That&#39;s what principles support. Not good behaviour. Good, solid, loving, unconditional relationships. When relationships are in order, the behaviour follows because people feel supported, understood, valued, and the list goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it is <br/>\n&gt; all about having a clear idea in our own heads, as parents, of what our <br/>\n&gt; interactions with our children mean TO THEM, from their point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do think there are people out there who aren&#39;t unschoolers who parent this way or who want to parent this way. However, they break trust with their children every single day they send them to school. When I was a school counsellor (a couple of degrees and several years later), I spent a good deal of my time (when not dealing with &quot;behaviour problems&quot;) helping children and parents with school refusal. I often recommended homeschooling (to the chagrin of my principals) when a child was so clearly devastated by the separation with the parent. The parents were so relieved that someone didn&#39;t think it was a problem that their child didn&#39;t want to separate (they had been blamed so often for being too enmeshed) - they didn&#39;t want to either but thought they &quot;had to&quot; (another bi-product of going through the school system ourselves). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that radical unschoolers have examined their own &quot;schooled&quot; perspectives, deschooled their thinking (about learning and about relationships) and have moved into an integrated living/learning lifestyle with their children. I was going to use the word &quot;integrity&quot; but scared myself a little. However, I think that&#39;s true. It is about integrity in that we live our beliefs  in all areas of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When we are more able to think from our kids&#39; point of view, we are more <br/>\n&gt; able to figure out what we can do that will really help a situation. It <br/>\n&gt; makes a huge difference in what choices we make, as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes... seeing things through the eyes of our child. True empathy. Those things need to be  in there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was what I meant to be heading toward when I spoke of &quot;getting to the root of the problem&quot; rather than just seeing is as problem behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But most parents think that any show of sympathy will be <br/>\n&gt; perceived as a reward by the child for his misbehavior and will <br/>\n&gt; condition him to do more and more of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know! And how far from the truth! <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wish someone had locked Skinner in his own box for an afternoon. Behaviourism set our whole society back several paces when people started to apply the theories to real live children (and adults) without accounting for the complexity of being human.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think things are shifting. This afternoon I was reflecting on how the trend toward attachment parenting (and all that entails) may be setting the stage for more people to be drawn toward unschooling and that this may mean that they actually &quot;get it&quot; sooner than people have in the past. I have no idea if that&#39;s true, but I think it might be nice it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] rules/principles","postDate":"1272140237","msgId":53363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRDM1MUNELjIwMzAxMDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU0RDM4RUUzLTg0REItNEMwMS1BNDU2LUJDOURDODQxMjlEMEBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEU0RDM4RUUzLTg0REItNEMwMS1BNDU2LUJDOURDODQxMjlEMEBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53355,"nextInTopic":53368,"prevInTime":53362,"nextInTime":53364,"topicId":53354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
