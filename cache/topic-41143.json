Many casual Monopoly players are surprised to  <br/>\ndiscover that some of the rules that they are used to are not part of  <br/>\nthe official rules. Many of these house rules tend to make the game  <br/>\nlonger by randomly giving players more money. Some common house rules  <br/>\nare listed below:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tAt the start of the game $2000 is given out to each of the players  <br/>\ninstead of $1500. Each player gets 2 500s, 4 100s, 4 50s, 6 20s, 8  <br/>\n10s, 10 5s, and 10 1s<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tFree Parking jackpot, which usually consists of an initial stake  <br/>\n(typically $500, or $5 million in the Here & Now Edition) plus  <br/>\ncollections of fines and taxes otherwise paid to the bank. A player  <br/>\nwho lands on Free Parking wins the jackpot, which may then be reset  <br/>\nwith the initial stake (if any). The jackpot is usually put in the  <br/>\ncenter of the board. Since the jackpot forms an additional income for  <br/>\nplayers in this set of house rules, games can take a much longer time  <br/>\nthan under normal rules.[18]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tEliminating the auction if a player decides not to purchase a  <br/>\nproperty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tRequiring that every property be put up for auction (this  <br/>\neliminates some of the luck in the game of landing on particular  <br/>\nsquares and forces players to strategize more).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tAllowing an unlimited number of houses to be available from the  <br/>\nbank. When this house rule is implemented, substitute counters or  <br/>\nwritten tallies are often employed to allay the actual shortage of  <br/>\nhouse tokens in a standard game box.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tAgreeing that each player be allowed to collect all of a color  <br/>\ngroup once they have &#39;staked a claim&#39; by buying only one of those  <br/>\nproperties. The same agreement may or may not be carried over to the  <br/>\nrail stations and utilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tPlayers in jail cannot collect rent, build houses, or conduct  <br/>\ntrades. This can be combined with increasing the price to get out of  <br/>\njail considerably (normally $50, or $500,000 in the Here & Now  <br/>\nEdition). Together, these rules make jail a far more significant  <br/>\nburden than that listed in the normal rules. Other players may bail  <br/>\nthe player out of jail but only if the player agrees.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tA bonus for landing directly on Go by dice roll (commonly an  <br/>\nadditional $200 or $500). This may or may not include cards that send  <br/>\nthe player to Go.[18]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tDelayed Start: Players must pass Go (or circle the board at least  <br/>\nonce, or rarely twice) before they can buy property.[18]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tOnly allowing houses (or hotels) to be built when the owner lands  <br/>\non the group<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tA bonus for rolling snake eyes (a pair of ones), often $500, $100,  <br/>\nor one of each bill.[19][20]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tAll properties are handed out evenly to all players before the  <br/>\ngame begins, or one or two are dealt to each player. This variation  <br/>\nis in the official US and UK rules as a short game option.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tIn trades, players may offer &quot;rent immunity&quot; from their own  <br/>\nproperties (someone does not have to pay rent for landing on that  <br/>\nproperty) as part of a deal (this can be good for a certain number of  <br/>\nlandings or the entire game).[18]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�\tUnlimited amounts of hotels on each space.<br/>\n<br/>\nHouse rules, while unofficial, are not wholly unrecognized by Parker  <br/>\nBrothers. George S. Parker himself created two variants, to shorten  <br/>\nthe length of game play.[clarification needed] Video game and  <br/>\ncomputer game versions of Monopoly have options where popular house  <br/>\nrules can be used*. House rules that have the effect of randomly  <br/>\nintroducing more money into the game have a side-effect of increasing  <br/>\nthe time it takes for players to become bankrupt, lengthening the  <br/>\ngame considerably, as well as decreasing the effects of strategy and  <br/>\nprudent investment. House rules which increase the amount of money in  <br/>\nthe game may change the strategies of the players, such as changing  <br/>\nthe relative value of different properties- the more money in the  <br/>\ngame, the more one may wish to invest in the higher value properties.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* On the Wikipedia video game page it says the Free Parking jackpot  <br/>\nis one of the house rules allowed:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some versions however, like the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation  <br/>\nversions, do allow the most common &quot;house rules&quot; (Free Parking  <br/>\njackpot, no collecting rent in jail, unlimited houses/hotels, etc) to  <br/>\nbe turned off or on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich makes it an officially recognized house rule, which wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nchange tradition if they decided not to include it as an allowable  <br/>\nhouse rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a more extensive list of house rules at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Monopoly/House_Rules\">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Monopoly/House_Rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Exploring cheat code opinions","postDate":"1230112611","msgId":41158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3MDc3MS44OTQ0Mi5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41157,"nextInTopic":41159,"prevInTime":41157,"nextInTime":41159,"topicId":41143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We totally play that you collect the money from the free parking.

So, <br/>\nwhen Nintendo got popular and companies started producing cheat  cartridges, <br/>\nit was kind of bizarre.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn my years of videogaming before our kids came along, I  refused to use <br/>\ncartridges or codes the first time through a game.

It also skipped many  levels, depending on <br/>\nyour score, when you finished a level. When I found a code  for that one, it <br/>\nlet me shut the game off and start up again next time from  where I left off (I <br/>\nthink 1000 levels, so we&#39;re talking many hours of play,  here), minus the <br/>\nscore-which I didn&#39;t really care about. It also allowed me go  to back through and <br/>\nplay it over again playing each level instead of skipping  them. It made my <br/>\ngameplay fuller and more challenging, rather than annoying or  boring or quick.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince my kids have been born, I just don&#39;t have the time to  immerse myself <br/>\nin a game the way I used to, so I sometimes take advantage of  cheat codes or <br/>\n(more often) walkthroughs, to zip through those parts that I know  I could <br/>\naccomplish without help, but it makes it much quicker. I often play  open-ended <br/>\ngames where there might be a lot of searching for the next clue or  person you <br/>\nneed to talk to or item that needs found, so a walkthrough helps me  skip the <br/>\nlong hours of searching.<br/>\n <br/>\nWyl, 9, loves looking up help on the computer. Sometimes, he  prefers to do <br/>\nit himself, but sometimes he has a goal he&#39;s aiming for and the  codes or <br/>\nwalkthroughs get him past the &quot;small&quot; (to him), and sometimes the  frustration is <br/>\ntoo much and a code or walk through will end the frustrating  part, so he can <br/>\nmove on.<br/>\n <br/>\nIsn&#39;t that kind of like picking up the house or some  big thing that is <br/>\neasier done with help?

You can play  <br/>\nMonopoly without mortgaging things.  You can play cribbage or poker  <br/>\nwithout betting money.  When you play rummy, Aces can be 5 points if  <br/>\nplayed as a 1, or 15 points.  People just decide before they start  <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is the word &quot;cheat.&quot;   But a video game isn&#39;t  <br/>\nentrance exams to Cambridge.  A video game isn&#39;t even federal income  <br/>\ntax, and lots of people cheat on income taxes if they can figure out  <br/>\na way, and &quot;legal tax loopholes&quot; are like cheats you need to research  <br/>\nor pay professionals to find for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could one &quot;cheat&quot; a single player video game?  Out of WHAT?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe owned a stand-up arcade game years ago, and just used to leave it  <br/>\nunlocked and click the counter up to 99 once in a while.  People  <br/>\nplayed for free.  Was that &quot;Cheating&quot;?  Were we going to charge our  <br/>\nfriends a quarter to play a game!??<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the &quot;cheat codes&quot; are codes programmers use to test the parts  <br/>\nof the game they&#39;re working on, so a guy who&#39;s building the end part  <br/>\nof some portion of the game doesn&#39;t have to play up to it (or his  <br/>\nbeta testers don&#39;t have to play up to that point, they can just start  <br/>\nthere).  It&#39;s not &quot;cheating,&quot; except it&#39;s a different place to start  <br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackgammon  starts with pieces already on the board, in a certain  <br/>\nformation.  There&#39;s another game played with the same pieces and  <br/>\nboard called &quot;Acey-Deucey,&quot; and the pieces start off the board.  So  <br/>\nis backgammon a &quot;cheat code&quot; version of &quot;acey deucy&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith points out that most games, and backgammon particularly so,  <br/>\nwere gambling games.  Gambling is calmly accepted in England. In the  <br/>\nU.S.  it&#39;s one of the puritanical sins, and so that might also add to  <br/>\nthe &quot;cheat code&quot; prejudice in some people.  It goes against hard work  <br/>\nto reach a goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan Vilter wrote about helping make video games easier for  kids.   <br/>\nThat might be a good read for this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/game/cheats\">http://sandradodd.com/game/cheats</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh!
