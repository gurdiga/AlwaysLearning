Here are some of my responses:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How/why you think of new topics and discussions for the group.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something is rolling around in my head, I put it on the list.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not like there&#39;s a checklist or an agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n[I had said I would stir a topic back up and my correspondent said  <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t know what that meant.]<br/>\n<br/>\nI just meant I would add a response so it would come back up in the  <br/>\ncurrent mail and up higher on the list (for those who read it on the  <br/>\nweb) so it could get more attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the list seems to be going dark and sad, I&#39;m more likely to add  <br/>\nsomething cheery. If there hasn&#39;t been anything for a while (which  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t happened lately) I sometimes add something kind of perky and  <br/>\nopen-ended, just to keep people glad they&#39;re on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s super busy (like last month) I&#39;m less likely to encourage or  <br/>\nparticipate in something like a discussion of Alan Rickman. &quot;On  <br/>\ntopic&quot; is more important when people are getting cranky or there are  <br/>\nover 100 posts a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n=============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t touch on the approval of posts, or how to decide to let  <br/>\nsomeone off moderations or leave them on (or put them back on), but  <br/>\nthat&#39;s not what she was asking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Alan Rickman mention referred to something a few years back when  <br/>\nwe got on an Alan Rickman discussion of which movies are great of his  <br/>\nand what&#39;s so good about him anyway (&quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply,&quot;  &quot;Sense  <br/>\nand Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Quest,&quot; and if you don&#39;t love him after  <br/>\nthose, just never mind)  Oh.  Harry Potter, too.)  Someone got kind  <br/>\nof angry because I had sent something back for not being on topic  <br/>\nbecause it was about curriculum or workbooks or something, and she  <br/>\nwas trying to shame me and call me a cheat because I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nimmediately stop the Alan Rickman discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the deal, though.  Learning to be analytical about moviemaking  <br/>\nand acting and casting and the skillful use of a great voice is a  <br/>\nbull&#39;s eye for  unschooling, honestly.  It wasn&#39;t like we stopped  <br/>\ntalking about how people learn and how to create a learning  <br/>\nenvironment by going on an Alan Rickman &quot;explore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone who has read this far wonders what I&#39;m talking about, maybe  <br/>\nbuy some Thinking Sticks or go to the Thinking Sticks blog.
