We have a <br/>\ngreat local group but I love the diversity of experience I can find <br/>\non these boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nZ is 8 (9 in Aug), loves Webkinz, Club Penguin, Pokemon and recently <br/>\ncooking! He says he plans to travel to Egypt when he&#39;s 19, find the <br/>\ntreasure buried in the pyramids, then come home and become famous in <br/>\nhis own band, then finally be a chef in his friends restuarant!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a foreman in the carpenters union and unfortunetly <br/>\nworks more than he&#39;d like, although that should change soon. I&#39;m a <br/>\nretired massage therapist. (Although I only worked a couple days a <br/>\nweek, I just recently decided to stay home full time.) We&#39;re hoping <br/>\nto have more kids soon as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for over a year now but didn&#39;t start mindfully <br/>\nunschooling until a bit later than that. We&#39;ve probably made all the <br/>\npreverbial mistakes one can make in going from conventional parenting <br/>\nto peaceful parenting. The biggest and first one was probably in <br/>\ntelling our son what exactly unschooling was! I wish I had known to <br/>\njust start saying &quot;yes&quot; but I somehow missed that until it was too <br/>\nlate! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, we&#39;ve come a long way and are looking forward to learning <br/>\nmore about practical ways to apply what we know. I think that is the <br/>\nbiggest issue I currently face: I&#39;ve changed the way I think and want <br/>\nto respond but I don&#39;t always know the practical way to put it into <br/>\naction, ya know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to lurking, questioning and occasionally sharing!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Tara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32625,"nextTopicId":32694}}
