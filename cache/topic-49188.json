But she was always very self confident and always knew what she liked and din&#39;t like from birth.  So when I tried to impose my will on her we clashed and our relationship suffered tremendously.  I would go to bed crying many nights not knowing what to do and how to heal our relationship.  I felt guilty and aweful.  Then I began to consider homeschooling because I saw how harmonious the homeschooled kids I knew from church seemed with their parents (also in college I knew kids who were homeschooled and were taking college clases at 14-15 years old and that impressed me at the time).  Long story short one day I read the book A Thomas Jefferson Education, and although it&#39;s not an unschooling book it made me realise that freedom is the best way for my children to discover God&#39;s calling in their lives.  So I read and researched more and eventually came across the unschooling philosophy.  It was such a natural fit for us (now I have 4 kids).   Now my oldest DD (who&#39;s now 9)and I have the best mother/daughter relationship that I could ask for because I&#39;ve learned to give her the respect that I desire for her to have toward for me and I give her and my other children the freedom they deserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nRosy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;almadoing&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been mulling over the many different ways people begin the radical unschooling journey.

I don&#39;t usually make time to post but wanted to post to this since I came across unschooling in a different way too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know anything about homeschooling let alone unschooling but we began unschooling at birth.  My husband and I were in college then and we simply enjoyed our daughter. We would introduce her to as much as possible about the world around her and follow her interests and we&#39;d just have fun learning together.  I used to get really sad when I&#39;d think about having to separate from her once she turned 5 and would need to go to kindergarten. I always dreaded that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, one day I met a woman who after watching our children interact asked me if I homeschooled her.  I didn&#39;t even know what she was talking about, lol!  Long story short, she homeschooled her son and saw &quot;something&quot; in my daughter.  I left that lady, went straight to the library and got every book I could on the subject and from that day, I knew my daughter would not be going to school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though unschooling is what came naturally, I did try the school at home approach which lasted not quite a week, lol!
