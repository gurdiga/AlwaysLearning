I love these :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been binging on Holt books, unschooling lists and stimulating <br/>\nconversation this last week. This list has provided some great <br/>\nshifts in my thinking lately. I *thought* I have had a good idea on <br/>\nwhat &quot;unschooling&quot; means. Well I don&#39;t think I ever really *GOT* it <br/>\nbefore this last week. I have read a ton, I have listened to other <br/>\nunschoolers talk, and I have understood in *theory* what it is. Well <br/>\nI have been missing some BIG points. Mainly, that is is hugely a <br/>\ncontinuation on what attachment parenting or gentle parenting is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have admittedly fallen off the wagon of &quot;gentle parenting&quot; by my <br/>\nown standards since my ds has been born. My patience has suffered, <br/>\nmy kindness has been lacking, and I have become the monster mommy at <br/>\ntimes that I swore I would NEVER be. I don&#39;t know how or when this <br/>\nhappened, but I&#39;ve dissapointed my self with barking orders and go <br/>\nto bed feeling so unhappy. I really needed this list to kind of kick <br/>\nmy but kindly back to the way I had been...a more mindful parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nChloe (4)and I have really spent some quality time together the last <br/>\ncouple of nights especially and she actually shared with me lots of <br/>\nher feelings which we haven&#39;t shared since my son was born. I really <br/>\nhave felt that she has been distant from me. We always have gotten <br/>\nalong so well and really truely enjoyed each others company. For <br/>\nexample, she will never tell me what she does when she is away from <br/>\nme. She never wants to tell me or show me what she has &quot;learned&quot; at <br/>\ngymnastics or ballet. Last night she stayed up really late with me <br/>\nand she just shared so much with me. This last year we have been <br/>\nlike enemies at times, always working against eachother or taking <br/>\nopposite views more often then not. I feel like our relationship had <br/>\nstarted to progress into what my own mother and I were/ are like <br/>\nvery antagonizing to eachother; my mom and I are very close on an <br/>\nintellectual level, but VERY distant on an emotional level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone had mentioned that the breaking down of the posts are <br/>\nbeneficial mostly for the silent list members and not always as <br/>\nhelpful to the original poster. I think you got that right! I have <br/>\nbeen like a sponge this last week and it feels GREAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nTicia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16957,"nextTopicId":16996}}
