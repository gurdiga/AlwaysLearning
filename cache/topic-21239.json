Other kids their age, I am sure,  were home <br/>\nin bed because tomorrow is a school day.  I was the only  woman.  I am sure <br/>\nwe got more than a couple of glances from the mostly  18-25 year old men in <br/>\nline.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had ordered one, but he&#39;s out of town.  So he and Marty went a few days <br/>\nago and switched the receipt to Marty&#39;s name.  But Marty&#39;s not old enough to <br/>\npick it up, so I would have to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night was the big night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFour extra boys were here.  One had ordered his own copy, from another store.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey got two TVs set up in the library, and two x-boxes, by 10:00.<br/>\nWith two hours to wait, they wanted to pick up another game to play in the <br/>\nmeantime, so went to Joey&#39;s brother-in-law&#39;s house.  His sister is in NYC and <br/>\nhad called and reported that a store in NYC had a line that went TWICE around <br/>\nthe block.   It was only a few days ago that Keith had been telling Marty and <br/>\nHolly how big the blocks in New York City are.  Quickly made connection for <br/>\nMarty!<br/>\n<br/>\nThree kids went to get Brett&#39;s.  Four (with Holly) went with me to get <br/>\nMarty&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt midnight there were about 50 people in line.  Some, like our group, were <br/>\ntwo or more to pick up a single game.   They split the line into those who had <br/>\nfully pre-paid, and those who had just paid a deposit, so one line was going <br/>\nfaster.  Kirby had a pre-paid deluxe (in a metal box, with something else in <br/>\nthere, maybe a red vs. blue episode?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a half an hour for Marty to get through the line.  We were back at <br/>\n12:40 a.m. and he called Brett to see how that line was.  Brett was still in <br/>\nline at the mall.  About 100 people in line, he said.   I went to bed before <br/>\nlearning what time they arrived.<br/>\n<br/>\nOurs came from a strip mall not far from us, at GamePro at Juan Tabo and <br/>\nMenaul (for those who want to picture this &lt;g&gt;) and the line went past the Keva <br/>\nJuice, which was closed.  I was thinking they missed their bet, but then again <br/>\nthese folks might not have been able to afford a $3 energy organic grass juice <br/>\ndrink.   Inside the store they were offering free miniature sodas (those <br/>\nhalf-sized cans), but people were too excited to want any, it seemed.  The game was <br/>\nplaying on a demo, but nobody was playing it.  They didn&#39;t want to do <br/>\nanything but get their own copy and go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first pulled in I drove by the line and Holly said &quot;Look at all those <br/>\nlonely boys.&quot;<br/>\nI let them all out at the end of the line, and went to park where I could <br/>\nwatch the line so i didn&#39;t have to stand in the cold before I was really needed.  <br/>\nI was thinking &quot;Look at all those future engineers and managers; that&#39;s where <br/>\nthe girls ought to look for a boyfriend.&quot;   I said it to Marty when we were <br/>\ninside the store and the other three were waiting outside.   Some seemed <br/>\nmusicianish, too (a bonus, in my mind).   These were the geeks who <br/>\n--planned ahead<br/>\n--could show up on time<br/>\n--had $60<br/>\n<br/>\nNot lonely losers.  Organized and dedicated gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were younger kids than Holly there, and I said, &quot;These can&#39;t all be <br/>\nhomeschoolers!  I guess a lot of people are going to miss school tomorrow.&quot;  One <br/>\nof the employees, who was jollying the people in line said he had heard some <br/>\npeople say they were taking the rest of the week off, some from school, some <br/>\nfrom work.  They used it like a vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if he remembered the origins of this midnight pick-up thing, and <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t.  I speculated it might be caused by 24-hour Walmarts.  Marty said <br/>\nit had been happening with movie releases, midnight showings, for several <br/>\nyears.   I said Harry Potter books were the first I remembered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else here know?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn towns without 24-hour Walmarts, do people just wait until morning to buy <br/>\ntheir exciting new releases?<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody showed up there to buy one who didn&#39;t have a reserved copy, they said. <br/>\n  <br/>\nSomeone else complained that it was $5 less at Walmart, and he had told them <br/>\nyes, but Walmart didn&#39;t take advance orders and they were going to run out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an interesting phenomenon, though, for absolute sure.  So we&#39;re not the <br/>\nonly people accepting of and encouraging of game playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mistake, maybe, that the store made was not having the X-box controls <br/>\nright by the line.  The line was passing by Playstation supplies, and X-box <br/>\nwas across the room.  They had taken out all their floor displays (used dvds <br/>\nand such) partly to allow room for a line, and probably to avoid theft.  A store <br/>\nusually full of cluttery stuff had a fully empty center space, with just wall <br/>\ndisplays.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael McCantz, another homeschooler we&#39;ve known for years,  now 18 or 19, <br/>\narrived and ceremoniously departed the back door of the little RV his mom <br/>\ndrives around.  He was wearing  a long coat and cool hat, and had a friend with <br/>\nhim.  Typical Michael style.  I spoke to him when I came out to join the line, <br/>\nand then he saw Holly and talked to her about her green hair, and talked to <br/>\nMarty some.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an event.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday night there&#39;s a party here, and I expect they might get 12 to 16 <br/>\nplayers going at once.  I only found out last night that Kirby had been inviting <br/>\npeople over , but I don&#39;t mind.  He&#39;s gone until Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Halo 2","postDate":"1100012531","msgId":21247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTA5MTUwMjExLjYxNjU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxMTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMxLjRhZWQ1YzA0LjJlYzIzMDBlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21245,"nextInTopic":21248,"prevInTime":21246,"nextInTime":21248,"topicId":21239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Maybe when those young men at the store have kids of their own they will look back and see there is another option then what society has said is acceptable","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1805347697\">**Maybe when those young men at the store have kids of their own they will  <br/>\nlook back and see there is another option then what society has said is  <br/>\nacceptable for parenting.**<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYes!
