If Zak has <br/>\nbeen with his grandparents or we went to the movies or to our home <br/>\nschooling meeting then he gets annoyed and jealous that Zak got to <br/>\ndo something fun, whilst he had to go to school.  Even though the <br/>\nschool doesn&#39;t require him to do anything in the way of &quot;school <br/>\nwork&quot;..

I think I&#39;ll pursue this a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me it&#39;s not so much about that it&#39;s that I love what I do for a <br/>\nliving and don&#39;t want to give it up and how do I balance that with <br/>\nbeing with the kids the majority of the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an incredible husband that is completely into unschooling.  <br/>\nHe stayed at home for 2 years with the kids whilst I expanded my <br/>\nbusiness from part time to full time, whilst he got his MBA and I <br/>\nfinancially supported us.  Currently he&#39;s working a part time job <br/>\nand it works, but has just taken a full time job that we don&#39;t know <br/>\nhe&#39;ll stay at and that puts me in charge more of the day/evening <br/>\nwith the kids and less time to work on my business.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my business I can schedule my clients whenever I want and most of <br/>\nmy business is flexible (except when I&#39;m on certain radio stations - <br/>\nthen I have to be &quot;on the air&quot; when they say) so I&#39;m thinking as I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting it&#39;s more of a time management issue and that&#39;s an area that <br/>\nI could do with some input on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I also feel guilty if I&#39;m answering e-mails and the kids are <br/>\nplaying, like I ought to be with them doing something all the time.  <br/>\nMaybe these are just old messages from my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of family my parents don&#39;t support us in home schooling of <br/>\nany kind.

After that she asked if she could go for a <br/>\nfew days to have more of an experience, so she went for 3 more days.  I think there were <br/>\nthings she liked (being with kids her age--we&#39;re a bit isolated here) but the loss of <br/>\nfreedom inherent in going to school was obvious to her.  Why would she want to do what <br/>\nsomeone else told her all day?  She is now about to turn ten and gets a big kick out of <br/>\ntelling people she went to school for 4 days.

Nah - we really dropped that option from our radar such a  <br/>\nlong time ago that it wouldn&#39;t occur to me to consider it.  Even at  <br/>\nour worst moments (and, yes, we have had times when we weren&#39;t  <br/>\ngetting along well) it seemed best to me that we were together to  <br/>\nwork through things that needed working through. Besides, I talk to  <br/>\nthose schooled-kids parents a lot - I&#39;m spending this entire weekend  <br/>\nat a soccer tournament, for example, hanging out with parents of kids  <br/>\nwho go to school. During lunch yesterday the other parents spent the  <br/>\nENTIRE lunch time talking about all the problems they have with their  <br/>\nkids - all related to school issues and all causing conflicts between  <br/>\nparents and kids. These are involved and caring parents with good  <br/>\nkids - girls spending their weekend hanging around with their soccer  <br/>\nteam friends - all really what you&#39;d call &quot;wholesome&quot; girls. But, to  <br/>\nlisten to their parents, their school lives are extremely difficult,  <br/>\nit is one problem after another - often ridiculous problems created  <br/>\nby school officials making up rules and applying them without regard  <br/>\nto individual situations. Let&#39;s see, here is an example of the topics  <br/>\ndiscussed at lunch yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nTardiness to class - one girl has had so many tardies that they are  <br/>\nthreatening to reduce the credits she&#39;s earning which would mean  <br/>\ntaking an extra class next year in order to be able to graduate on  <br/>\ntime, but that would mean she&#39;d probably have to quit playing soccer  <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s already overwhelmed with homework and next year she  <br/>\nalso has to do the mandatory community service graduation  <br/>\nrequirement, too. Her tardies are because she has a class for first- <br/>\nperiod that is off-campus and that teacher isn&#39;t letting them out in  <br/>\ntime to get to the campus for second-period on time. Does the second- <br/>\nperiod teacher care? Nah. This has been an ongoing problem for  <br/>\nseveral years. To make up the tardies, she is supposed to go to  <br/>\ndetention - but she can&#39;t go after school to detention because of  <br/>\nother activities - soccer practice is one - and she can&#39;t go to  <br/>\nSaturday morning detention because that&#39;s when the soccer games are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there are more - there is the girl who is extremely sociable -  <br/>\non the soccer team she talks and talks and is full of energy and is  <br/>\nhappy and inspiring and often the center of some kind of fun plan.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s the one who gets the other girls to dump an ice chest of cold  <br/>\nwater on the coach after a game and she&#39;s the one who gets all the  <br/>\ngirls together for pizza, etc. Social director. Great kid. But she&#39;s  <br/>\nalways in trouble at school. Her mom and dad spend lots of time there  <br/>\nwith her in the principal&#39;s office, trying to figure out &quot;what to do  <br/>\nabout Tiffany.&quot; They sat at lunch yesterday with other parents and  <br/>\nopenly talked about trying to figure out what is WRONG with her  <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s so much more interested in her social stuff than in her  <br/>\nclasses. Other parents&#39; advice - take away the social life until she  <br/>\ncracks down on studying and raises her grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - enough about school because that isn&#39;t the point. The point  <br/>\nis that if someone is fantasizing about sending their kids off to  <br/>\nschool and things being EASIER for the parents - then it might be  <br/>\ndoing you more harm than you imagine because it is comparing the  <br/>\nreality of no-school with an idealized picture of school. My own  <br/>\nexperience is that parents of kids in school are often feeling  <br/>\ntortured over the problems school is creating in their lives and that  <br/>\nschooling is the number one thing that alienates children from their  <br/>\nparents and that THAT leads to all kinds of other big problems. Even  <br/>\nthe very best school experience is pretty awful (for parents and  <br/>\nkids) compared to real-life in a devoted unschooling family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think indulging in that kind of fantasy is a good idea  <br/>\nand it would be better to be more realistic about what school often  <br/>\nreally does to parents and their children. Then, when things are  <br/>\ndifficult in our own lives as unschooling parents, when we&#39;re tired  <br/>\nand frustrated, we can focus more on resolving our problems and  <br/>\nworking through issues, without that background idea that we could  <br/>\njust send the kids to school. Better to recognize that school isn&#39;t a  <br/>\nrealistic panacea and live as if school didn&#39;t exist. I really  <br/>\nsuggest letting that thought of &quot;send them to school&quot; go - stop  <br/>\nthinking of that as a last resort when things seem especially  <br/>\ndifficult. It is a sort of booby trap in a parents&#39; thinking  <br/>\nprocesses - it won&#39;t help you unschool more joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283675851,"authorName":"Vida","from":"Vida &lt;vidamel@...&gt;","profile":"riverwolfspirit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Talk me out of my Evil Fantasy","postDate":"1180339071","msgId":28862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyODA2NjJGLjNGNjAldmlkYW1lbEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VNRUdGQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":28861,"nextInTopic":28867,"prevInTime":28861,"nextInTime":28863,"topicId":28850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She planned to pull him out for Homeschooling at Christmas break and it was Oct. The teacher put him in the back of the room and ignored him. Wouldnt let him participate in the learning the Christmas play or anything. My friend went ahead and removed him. I kept him until she could quit her job. They are very fickle folks! I wouldnt try it. You may DO experiments WITH your kids but your kids are NOT experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you considered a day or &#39;live in&#39; camp for summer? One where they can choose what craft station to do, or whether to swim or hike? My kids (teens now) Started going to camp at age 7. Between the horses, canoes, hiking, swimming, camp fires, games, crafts, go carts, rock walls, and etc...they Dont ever want to come home. I get a week off(this year 2 weeks since they are now junior councilors, next year they can stay the whole summer if they want too(and they will))<br/>\nSince camps stay so busy, that may be just the thing you need for a break, The kids would actually have fun and be free.(Not stuck being told to sit still and shut up all day like in a school setting)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt(Unschooling) gets easier as they get older, they find what they want without you having to (or being allowed to) find things for them. They become independent, and self starters. They want to do stuff alone and show you the final product, They grow up...Then you will miss all the fun you had with them.

Where we lived then, there weren&#39;t alot of &#39;unschool/homeschool&#39; families. We did stuff and had fun, but she said she missed her school mates. She played with them everyday after the bus brought them home, and all summer long.  She forgot what school was like.  When the new school year started in Sept., she wanted to go.  I enrolled her and said &#39;if you like it stay, if you dont like it, let me know&#39;.  She did ok for two weeks, then asked to be homeschooled again.  Asked her why- &#39;boring. we sit all day. &#39; <br/>\n  First when she returned to school, didn&#39;t know what to do with myself.  2nd week, I began to figure out some stuff to do by myself. (yes, I enjoyed being by myself) Took her out, and we returned to homeschooling life. She didn&#39;t ask again, although at end of each summer, she missed her school friends.  We now live in another state that has many homeschooling activities, and she knows quite a few hs&#39;d kids.<br/>\n  Anyway, I know how you feel; my situation wasn&#39;t same as yours, but yes, you do get burn out.  My advice--take a little downtime.  Everyday doesn&#39;t need to be a &#39;trove of learning&#39;.  Some times it&#39;s nice to be quiet, entertain yourselves, use your own resources in your head.  The kids wont &#39;lose out&#39; on anything.<br/>\n  Enjoy your life with them, there are plenty of things to do that will wait.  Others might disagree with me, but if they really want to go to school, let them.  Just tell them, if they change their minds, they can come home.
