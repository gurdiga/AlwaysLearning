Test?   <br/>\nSomething.  So the went along with jail and separation from their  <br/>\nchildren over THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, being with my children is first.  If I had to put them in  <br/>\nschool to continue to live with them, I&#39;d do it.  But I don&#39;t have  <br/>\nto.  I can go along with laws where I live (or choose judiciously not  <br/>\nto [oooh... freudian use of &quot;judicious]), but to flaunt my beliefs in  <br/>\nthe face of a social worker or state official would be irresponsible  <br/>\nand CRUEL to my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people want to make a big political play, wait until your own  <br/>\nchildren are too old to be removed from the home, or get your  <br/>\nchildless school-wounded activist friends to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t want to do the work to really READ things Holt  <br/>\nactually wrote, and to totally and fully and internally understand  <br/>\nWHY learning works.  They want to just kind of ride the coattails of  <br/>\npeople they see in peripheral vision and say, &quot;Well they&#39;re not in  <br/>\ntrouble, so I&#39;ll do some vague watered down version of it and we  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be in trouble either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to be brought into court, I could talk a lot about natural  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\nIf someone whose participation in discussions consists of things  <br/>\nlike  &quot;I think bringing up science is manipulative so I won&#39;t do it.&quot;  <br/>\nor  &quot;I think strewing is stupid, and you can&#39;t make me&quot; is brought to  <br/>\ncourt, what will SHE say?  &quot;Well Sandra&#39;s doing it.&quot;???<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe part of the oddity (this might should be on the unschooling as  <br/>\nprocess topic; I&#39;m assuming everyone on this list is reading every  <br/>\nword  of every topic &lt;g&gt;) is that in much of everyday life, one  <br/>\nbecomes a thing by signing up for a group and attending a meeting.   <br/>\nIn is in.  It does not work that way with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can become a girl scout or a member of the ladies&#39; auxiliary of  <br/>\nsome church or club or start going to AA, and say &quot;I am a girl scout,  <br/>\na member of the altar society, and I go to AA meetings.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, one isn&#39;t an unschooler until unschooling is  <br/>\nhappening.  Some have written on a forum or a list for over a year  <br/>\nand still hasn&#39;t taken the kids out of school.  There&#39;s no membership  <br/>\ncard, or dues, and joining a list doesn&#39;t make one an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting to unschool doesn&#39;t make one an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve seen three or four arguments (e-mail today, not on the  <br/>\nlist, and some on unschooling.info) that it&#39;s possible for the mom to  <br/>\nbe unschooling even if the dad doesn&#39;t agree.

There is a real sense that homeschooling is a cult issue in France. The law states (from what I can quickly find) that parents can homeschool if they do so for religious reasons. But because of some law (I can&#39;t find the specific one, it came at the same time as the About-Picard Law) homeschooling has to be very clearly not done for &quot;cultish&quot; religious reasons. And cults tend to include evangelical groups within the French definition. It seems to me that it is the evangelicals that have moved homeschooling into the mainstream in the U.S.(it is less so in the UK, where it seems to have been less about religious freedom than about personal choice). Or at least pushed the numbers up enough to form HSLDA and Patrick Henry (unaccredited, no hand holding, certainly no kissing) college. And it may help to have public awareness be such that people see it as a viable alternative even if they aren&#39;t Christians for them to choose not only to homeschool but to also unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] french or no french","postDate":"1158592343","msgId":27008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVFQjdFRTlFLUJEQTMtNDU2Qy05NEQ3LUMwNEY3QkYxM0NCOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYzYwMWM2ZGIwZiQyMzA0NjIwMCQxNzRjNjBkNEBjaGV6MjMwZDVmMzNkMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ0QThEQTkzLTIyMDMtNDQxQi1CQjJBLTk4MkQ4RDFDQ0IzQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDQ1MENENjYyLjcwMTAwMDNAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4gPDU2MjY3MDkzLTMxQTktNEJGMS05RjU4LTFEOTZFMEQxRkFFRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAwYTUwMWM2ZGE4NSRlNDI2Yzc1MCQ3YTRlNjBkNEBjaGV6MjMwZDVmMzNkMj4gPEJDODJGNzhBLTExNEYtNDYyQi1CNEZBLUZEN0Y0N0IzNjFFQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAwYzYwMWM2ZGIwZiQyMzA0NjIwMCQxNzRjNjBkNEBjaGV6MjMwZDVmMzNkMj4="},"prevInTopic":27007,"nextInTopic":27010,"prevInTime":27007,"nextInTime":27009,"topicId":26959,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-, it seems to me like there are unschoolers everywhere, even if it s few in some places, there are unschoolers everywhere. -=-Do you think it s because of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1253957957\">-=-, it seems to me like there are unschoolers everywhere, even if  <br/>\nit&#39;s few in some places, there are unschoolers everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Do you think it&#39;s because of the discussion lists ? -=<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a second thought about why.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people unschool because they wanted to use structure and found  <br/>\nthat it was causing unhappiness in their families.

If he <br/>\nbarely communicates with you, then developing closer communication <br/>\nwith him by speaking English, is the priority. Letting go of wanting <br/>\nhim to grow up perfectly bilingual -- or even speaking French &quot;fluently&quot;, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is he negative about French, or is it just that he finds it too <br/>\ndifficult to talk to you in French? If he&#39;s negative about French <br/>\nlanguage and all things French, then a break from such things may <br/>\nhelp you to develop your relationship with him so that he trusts you <br/>\nto keep his needs at the forefront.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurely you would not be *letting go* of all things French? If it is <br/>\nyour native language, then surely there is some &quot;frenchness&quot; in your <br/>\nlife. Do you use French in any situations, other than interacting <br/>\nwith your son? Speak to your family in French? Sing in French? listen <br/>\nto French radio or watch French films because *you* want to, not to <br/>\nset an example for your son, or because you think you &#39;should&#39; for his sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children were small, I wanted them to speak Dutch. It&#39;s my <br/>\nsecond language, the only one  I speak fluently, and there are all <br/>\nthese &quot;advantages&quot; to children growing up bilingual.. I enjoyed it <br/>\nfor the first 2 years or so. My daughter Nicola spoke more Dutch than <br/>\nEnglish. She knew who to speak Dutch to (me) and who to speak English <br/>\nto, and I so loved watching the development of the two languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I got to the point where I realised *I* was avoiding speaking to <br/>\n*her*, because of the effort involved in formulating what I wanted to <br/>\nsay. Not good. We moved to using some Dutch and some English. Dutch <br/>\nin the car, very often.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil my son Felix was about 3, and started reacting very negatively <br/>\nto me speaking in a language other than English, presumably because <br/>\nhe did not understand it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDutch as a means of communication between me and my children went by <br/>\nthe wayside. My interest in Dutch did not.

Americans  <br/>\nliving abroad used it, or kids who were bedridden I guess.  Sick kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1970&#39;s John Holt started a newsletter for home schooling  <br/>\nfamilies who were fans of his writing, so they could communicate and  <br/>\nhe could share his new ideas, and that was Growing Without  <br/>\nSchooling.  It became more like a magazine, but it was never fancy  <br/>\nwith advertisements, though John Holt started selling things through  <br/>\nthat, so if it was an ad, it was an ad for the office where it was  <br/>\nproduced, and they were selling John Holt&#39;s books, and a few other  <br/>\nbooks, games?, pamphlets, a beginning piano course (different from  <br/>\ntraditional piano books).   Some of those things are sold here now:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fun-books.com/authors/John_Holt.htm\">http://www.fun-books.com/authors/John_Holt.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo for the liberal/intellectual side of it, John Holt and his  <br/>\nwritings were the source and inspiration for lots of unschoolers.    <br/>\nHis ideas were reinforced and expanded by contact with  people he  <br/>\nknew and worked with in New Mexico and Colorado, though, who were  <br/>\ndoing alternative school stuff in the late 60&#39;s and maybe early 70&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo separately, politically, lots of Christian churches started  <br/>\nbecoming more and more angry that public schools weren&#39;t pushing a  <br/>\nChristian agenda, and their split with public schools was about the  <br/>\nschools teaching too much--too much about equality of races and  <br/>\nsexes, too much sex education, too much history of evolution, too  <br/>\nmany reading assignments in which the characters weren&#39;t behaving as  <br/>\nthey wanted their children, as Christians, to behave.  If they  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t control the schools, they would pull their children out.  I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know the details of why they started using a curriculum at home  <br/>\ninstead of making private schools, but they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a whole church would pressure their people to homeschool,  <br/>\nwith the same curriculum. Someone three houses up from me when my  <br/>\nkids were little went to just such a church in Albuquerque.  The men  <br/>\nwere pressed to declare that their wive would homeschool, with one  <br/>\ncertain curriculum.   Undoubtedly, someone was getting a free  <br/>\ncurriculum for his own family by putting that pressure.  Then the  <br/>\nother moms would help each other out with homeschooling, sometimes  <br/>\nlike a co-op, and they would have science fairs and geography  <br/>\ncompetitions and spelling bees.  I say &quot;would have&quot; because I&#39;m still  <br/>\nthinking about Cindy&#39;s family, in the early 1990&#39;s.    It&#39;s still  <br/>\nhappening.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mom didn&#39;t want to homeschool her kids, she was told she needed  <br/>\nto be obedient to her husband and to God.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose folks were also told that Christians had invented homeschooling  <br/>\nbecause God wanted them to, so there was odd hostility and curiosity  <br/>\nabout &quot;secular homeschoolers.&quot;  I was asked more than once why I  <br/>\nwould homeschool if I didn&#39;t have to, and why a non-Christian would  <br/>\nhomeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were LOTS of them, and that kept the government from picking on  <br/>\nthe much lesser number of secular homeschoolers and unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe split remains, with lots of families in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sin of the unschoolers is no structure, no tests, no competitive  <br/>\nspirit, no help to add to statistics that &quot;prove homeschoolers do  <br/>\nbetter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sin of the other extreme is that their science is Bible-based,  <br/>\nwatered down not-really science.  Their history is re-written the way  <br/>\nthey wish it had happened, they don&#39;t teach &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; in  <br/>\nstates where it&#39;s a required part of the curriculum.  They  <br/>\nconcentrate on math facts, reading and writing. They teach to the  <br/>\ntest hoping that high scores will keep government agencies from  <br/>\nlooking any more closely at their overall program.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf John Holt was the rallying point for liberal secular types, the  <br/>\nHSLDA is the rallying point for the Christians and conservatives.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s a group of lawyers making a LOT of money off of putting fear  <br/>\ninto homeschooling families and then taking protection money from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re 35 years or so into it here.  It&#39;s not smooth.  This list is  <br/>\nsmooth. &lt;g&gt;  The overall world of homeschooling in the U.S. is pretty  <br/>\ncrazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to ignore all that back story and keep my own children&#39;s lives  <br/>\nbusy and happy and safe.  It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know all that and  <br/>\nappreciate it.  Growing Without Schooling Magazine used to be the  <br/>\nbiggest support in my world when Kirby was five and six and seven  <br/>\nyears old, when one of my support families moved a thousand miles  <br/>\naway and another moved thirty miles away and our babysitting co-op  <br/>\nbroke up partly over that and partly over a sexual misconduct  <br/>\nincident among the kids.   About that time, e-mail came along and  <br/>\nthere were user groups (vaguely like message boards today), and  <br/>\nhomeschoolers could contact other homeschoolers any day of the week  <br/>\nto discuss things and help each other.
