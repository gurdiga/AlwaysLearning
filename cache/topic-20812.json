Now I&#39;m at a point where I think about how they<br/>\n&gt; will develop an understanding of how to react with the rest of the world<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; an interdependent way without coercion. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; dedicated to making it work - but I&#39;m a creative thinker and think a lot<br/>\n&gt; about how things happen and don&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t have aspirations for my<br/>\n&gt; children to be perfect or to fit perfectly into a society that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; particularly think has it all right, but I do want them to possess skills<br/>\n&gt; that allow them to function in most social situations. I&#39;ve compromised my<br/>\n&gt; ideals on this front (of complete non-coercion) by talking with them about<br/>\n&gt; common space vs. personal space. Yes - I&#39;ve probably been somewhat<br/>\ncoercive<br/>\n&gt; although I try not to be - by the very nature of having a mature and well<br/>\n&gt; developed voice, there is some implicit coercion. Does anyone here have<br/>\n&gt; experience truly not coercing children in any way as to the parents&#39; view<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; etiquette, the world around them, their place in a communal living<br/>\n&gt; situation, etc? And what were some of the trials, how were they approached<br/>\n&gt; without coercion, and what was the eventual outcome?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My compromise at present is to tell my kids what I believe the world<br/>\naround<br/>\n&gt; them is like and what I see as the true consequences of this or that<br/>\naction<br/>\n&gt; in the real world. I also make my case in family meetings for instance -<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; a cleaner common area so we don&#39;t have to rush around to clean when we<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; company. And I do occasionally ask for help. They always just jump in when<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; ask and I don&#39;t make them feel bad about it getting dirty to begin with<br/>\n&gt; except those times when I say &quot;man, we are letting this place slip - maybe<br/>\n&gt; we should try this or that.&quot; I try to make it about us instead of about<br/>\n&gt; them. This actually seems to be working pretty well - I take them to a lot<br/>\n&gt; of other people&#39;s houses and invite a good number of people here. But I do<br/>\n&gt; worry that I&#39;m still being coercive.

We know what that&#39;s like. What folks have been trying to<br/>\n&gt; give you, at no charge and at an expense of their own time and effort, is<br/>\n&gt; alternatives. You don&#39;t have to take the gift, you don&#39;t have to like the<br/>\n&gt; gift, but it would be more polite not to go on auto-argue. Giving myself<br/>\n&gt; time to think over and percolate new concepts has in my life generally<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; a good idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are more alternatives than &quot;trip over toys, waste money, leave the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen a mess, get cavities, have cracked heads&quot;.

Thrusting away new ideas<br/>\nwithout<br/>\n&gt; examining them for awhile and seeing if there&#39;s anything about them, or if<br/>\n&gt; they stir anything interesting inside you, is probably a bad sign for when<br/>\n&gt; you hit the actual unschooling stumbling block.

Now I&#39;m at a point where I think about how they<br/>\nwill develop an understanding of how to react with the rest of the world in<br/>\nan interdependent way without coercion. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m<br/>\ndedicated to making it work - but I&#39;m a creative thinker and think a lot<br/>\nabout how things happen and don&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t have aspirations for my<br/>\nchildren to be perfect or to fit perfectly into a society that I don&#39;t<br/>\nparticularly think has it all right, but I do want them to possess skills<br/>\nthat allow them to function in most social situations. I&#39;ve compromised my<br/>\nideals on this front (of complete non-coercion) by talking with them about<br/>\ncommon space vs. personal space. Yes - I&#39;ve probably been somewhat coercive<br/>\nalthough I try not to be - by the very nature of having a mature and well<br/>\ndeveloped voice, there is some implicit coercion. Does anyone here have<br/>\nexperience truly not coercing children in any way as to the parents&#39; view of<br/>\netiquette, the world around them, their place in a communal living<br/>\nsituation, etc? And what were some of the trials, how were they approached<br/>\nwithout coercion, and what was the eventual outcome?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy compromise at present is to tell my kids what I believe the world around<br/>\nthem is like and what I see as the true consequences of this or that action<br/>\nin the real world. I also make my case in family meetings for instance - for<br/>\na cleaner common area so we don&#39;t have to rush around to clean when we have<br/>\ncompany. And I do occasionally ask for help. They always just jump in when I<br/>\nask and I don&#39;t make them feel bad about it getting dirty to begin with<br/>\nexcept those times when I say &quot;man, we are letting this place slip - maybe<br/>\nwe should try this or that.&quot; I try to make it about us instead of about<br/>\nthem. This actually seems to be working pretty well - I take them to a lot<br/>\nof other people&#39;s houses and invite a good number of people here. But I do<br/>\nworry that I&#39;m still being coercive.

We know what that&#39;s like. What folks have been trying to<br/>\ngive you, at no charge and at an expense of their own time and effort, is<br/>\nalternatives.

Having the ability and<br/>\nwillingness to seek the most kind and helpful ways to deal with each other<br/>\nas a family are, in my opinion, mandatory. Thrusting away new ideas without<br/>\nexamining them for awhile and seeing if there&#39;s anything about them, or if<br/>\nthey stir anything interesting inside you, is probably a bad sign for when<br/>\nyou hit the actual unschooling stumbling block. A shift in willing interest<br/>\nin learning on your part is a good unschooling move.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading through the archives of this list can be helpful. There are other<br/>\nlists that are helpful, too.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165915903\">I&#39;m sure this is an old topic, but I haven&#39;t dealt with it in a long time<br/>\nand have been pretty aggravated lately, a sure sign I need help and new<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have regular family meetings to establish things that need to be done<br/>\naround the house, or to change the way we do something because it isn&#39;t<br/>\nworking, or its boring, or whatever. We all have equal say, unless my<br/>\nhusband or I have a particular belief that we think is important enough to<br/>\ncall the shot (usually having to do with money), and we&#39;ll say that there is<br/>\nsomething that we don&#39;t have negotiation room for (this rarely happens<br/>\nthough...the kids make great decisions with monetary information as well as<br/>\nother things).<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, the house has been trashed. It used to be that my concerns about<br/>\nthis expressed at meetings were taken seriously and solutions were<br/>\nbrainstormed and implemented. But lately, I&#39;ve been blown off. I guess I&#39;m<br/>\nsounding like a broken record (though I haven&#39;t said anything for at least<br/>\nthree months). I am not prudish about a clean house...far from it! But I do<br/>\nhave minimum requirements...the front entranceway needs to be passable, food<br/>\nneeds to be put away and dishes clean within a day of using them, etc. I<br/>\njust like to keep the bugs at bay! And I do want the entrance to the house,<br/>\nthe first thing a &quot;guest&quot; sees, to be tidy. There&#39;s lots of other spaces to<br/>\nmess up. My three boys seem to have no interest or care about any of this.<br/>\nCome to think of it, my husband either. My daughter and I are the only ones<br/>\nwho agree on this. So, I don&#39;t want to be low-level pissed all the time<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a mess and I and my daughter are the only ones who want it<br/>\nclean, nor do I necessarily want to play this heavy-handedly and make it<br/>\nhappen. Wait. I take that back. I DO want to play this heavy-handedly, but<br/>\nmy unschooling brain says, &quot;No! Don&#39;t! You know better!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you incorporate house keeping into your unschooling and how do you<br/>\ndecide what needs to be done when and by whom?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions about the unschooling way to get what I want done :) ?<br/>\n(that was written as a joke, but I do want some suggestions about why this<br/>\nisn&#39;t working for me right now).<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20890,"nextTopicId":20907}}
