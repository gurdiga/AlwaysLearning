A man in a long coat<br/>\nwas holding their leashes and calmly watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur pajama clad father rushed out into the street, and<br/>\nthe man and his dogs ran off.  My dad carried the<br/>\npaper boy into the house, clothes torn, streaming<br/>\nblood, half conscious and he was laid out on the floor<br/>\non a blanket in the front hall while the ambulance was<br/>\ncalled.  My parents didn&#39;t want to move him any<br/>\nfurther than necessary.  My brother and I watched,<br/>\nround eyed, through the stair railing halfway up the<br/>\nstairs, as he was triaged by our parents, then the<br/>\nEMTs.  It was a subdued Christmas morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks later, after he was out of the hospital,<br/>\nthe paper boy came by with his family to thank my<br/>\nfather for saving his life.  His face was permanently<br/>\nscarred and stitched up, one arm and one leg were<br/>\nbadly broken.  I&#39;m sure he had other injuries that<br/>\nwere not as visible.

He chose a blonde female that the twins named Lucy (their adornment of <br/>\n  the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, they wanted to say everytime they walked in the <br/>\n  dorr...&quot;Lucy...we&#39;re home!!!). <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway she was the perfect little rat-dog. Pure bred and as gorgeous as any <br/>\n  show Pom we had ever seen. She was feisty, loved running endless laps around <br/>\n  the pool and thought she was the queen of all cricket catchers. Then she would <br/>\n  kiss and lick Sparky as he just sat looking worn out from watching her use so <br/>\n  much energy. She would pester him to no end and he would finally give in and <br/>\n  play with her. She was the epitome of a female. She would be naughty all day and <br/>\n  the second Phil got home she&#39;d slow down and seem coy as though we were all <br/>\n  making up the stuff she did. As we bitched about things she done, she just lick <br/>\n  his face as if to say Kass & Kree & I were all lying... He would talk to her <br/>\n  and tell her he knew we were making things up about her. It could have been <br/>\n  irritating, except that it was so damn funny. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Two weeks before our house was done being built, someone poisoned her. We <br/>\n  lived with my other best friend, who had a loser of a boyfriend. We will never <br/>\n  know for sure how it happened, but the boyfriend was mad at us, primarily at <br/>\n  Phil, because we were tired of his shit. So we buried her in my girlfriends <br/>\n  backyard. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Phil got the second Hercules about six months after we moved into this house. <br/>\n  He missed Lucy so much and the whole idea of another Hercules, he just <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t pass up getting the new Pit. I wish now, we had gotten a new Pomeranian <br/>\n  instead. There is a Disney movie with a psycho little Pom, that looks just like <br/>\n  his Lucy. When it comes on, he can&#39;t watch it without getting angry about <br/>\n  people who are cruel and use animals to get to people. So he calls upon the dog <br/>\n  gods to make sure such people get their just deserves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Then she would <br/>\nkiss and lick Sparky as he just sat looking worn out from watching her use so <br/>\nmuch energy. She would pester him to no end and he would finally give in and <br/>\nplay with her. She was the epitome of a female. She would be naughty all day and <br/>\nthe second Phil got home she&#39;d slow down and seem coy as though we were all <br/>\nmaking up the stuff she did. As we bitched about things she done, she just lick <br/>\nhis face as if to say Kass & Kree & I were all lying... He would talk to her <br/>\nand tell her he knew we were making things up about her. It could have been <br/>\nirritating, except that it was so damn funny. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks before our house was done being built, someone poisoned her. We <br/>\nlived with my other best friend, who had a loser of a boyfriend. We will never <br/>\nknow for sure how it happened, but the boyfriend was mad at us, primarily at <br/>\nPhil, because we were tired of his shit. So we buried her in my girlfriends <br/>\nbackyard. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhil got the second Hercules about six months after we moved into this house. <br/>\nHe missed Lucy so much and the whole idea of another Hercules, he just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pass up getting the new Pit. I wish now, we had gotten a new Pomeranian <br/>\ninstead. There is a Disney movie with a psycho little Pom, that looks just like <br/>\nhis Lucy. When it comes on, he can&#39;t watch it without getting angry about <br/>\npeople who are cruel and use animals to get to people. So he calls upon the dog <br/>\ngods to make sure such people get their just deserves.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dog advice request","postDate":"1060833564","msgId":16151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODE0MDM1OS5oN0UzeExJRzAyNjU5NUBtdGF3Ni5wcm9kaWd5Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":16150,"nextInTopic":16152,"prevInTime":16150,"nextInTime":16152,"topicId":16146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Whoops, sorry!

We are what some may refer to <br/>\nas a PitbBull family. Including my aunts and in-laws we have somewhere around <br/>\n12 Pits in the family. That is not to say that we have not experienced the <br/>\ntemperament that concerns you. For the most part, we have had wonderful <br/>\nexperiences. However, I think I posted here a while back, that our newest Pit, <br/>\nHercules II, killed our newest kitten Ace. Hercules was a puppy but as soon as he <br/>\nstarting getting bigger than my Schipperke, he started to display aggressive <br/>\nbehaviors. He became very jealous of any attention Sparky received, he then became <br/>\nterritorial over everything. Shipperke&#39;s by nature, are guard dogs and <br/>\nalthough they are small in stature, they are very protective and very good defenders <br/>\nof property and person. Needless to say, Sparky was getting attacked <br/>\nseemingly out of the blue. Although Sparky did do some serious ass kicking, Hercules <br/>\nwas growing larger and my concern was that there would come a day that Sparky <br/>\nwould not win. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very disappointing, because being from a family of Pit owners, we knew <br/>\nthe behavior was something that was innate in this specific dog. Phil and I <br/>\ndecided to separate the dogs and although I really wanted Hercules to be put <br/>\ndown, I knew Phil&#39;s heart was broken and he really loved what seemed a <br/>\nreincarnation of our first Hercules. But their demeanors were extreme opposites. Then <br/>\nwe got our three new kittens. One day while shopping with my mom, Hercules saw <br/>\nAce and came through the screen of our sliding door and mauled the poor <br/>\nkitten. Kass & Kree were hysterical and since it all happened so quickly, while Phil <br/>\nwas mowing the lawn, they couldn&#39;t save the kitten. The bigger issue for me <br/>\nupon walking in to the house and seeing everyone in tears was that at least it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t one of my daughters. We rushed the kitten to the vet and a hundred <br/>\ndollars later he was home with us to live out his last few hours. I ended up <br/>\nputting him down myself. It was horrible. Yet Ace was the small sacrifice that made <br/>\nus understand that for the first time we had one of those Pits. I was angry, <br/>\nnot because the dog acted upon his instincts, but because we hadn&#39;t accepted <br/>\nthat he was not the dog for us earlier. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would have been tougher to get rid of him without the killing of the <br/>\nkitten, because until he started fighting with Sparky, he slept with Kass and Kree. <br/>\nWe all loved him, we know how to handle Pits, yet we still had a bad <br/>\nexperience. So even though we miss poor Ace and are sorry for the way he died, without <br/>\nhis death, I wonder if we would still have Hercules II. In which case it may <br/>\nnot have been a kitten, but rather a kid. I know none of us would have been <br/>\nable to live with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although I still believe that the environment they live in is a factor, it <br/>\nalso remains that they are wired to kill. Everytime he went after Sparky it <br/>\nwas straight for the throat. Sometimes when Sparky just walked by. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow Hercules, the first, was the complete opposite. He was gentle and lovable <br/>\nand just really large. He accepted Sparky&#39;s status as the alpha male the <br/>\nentire time. The only aggression he ever displayed was against a Rottweiler that <br/>\nbeelined for Sparky only to be taken out by Hercules. He was protective of <br/>\nSparky and the twins. But not in the sense that I ever worried about his <br/>\ninteractions with them or even strangers. When he was stolen from our yard, I cried and <br/>\ncried. I hadn&#39;t even originally wanted him. But as all things that start that <br/>\nway, I grew attached to him in such a way, that the loss of him broke my <br/>\nheart, and that of my Dh and the girls. I searched day and night for him, I <br/>\nvisited every shelter for about a 50 mile radius. We never got him back. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome five years later, when Phil had a friend with papered puppies, he went <br/>\nto look and was shocked to see Hercules II, exact same markings and what seemed <br/>\nlike getting back the one we missed. But we were wrong to think the original <br/>\nHercules could ever be replaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I won&#39;t say don&#39;t keep her, but if you do be cautious of negative <br/>\nbehaviors that are not learned, but that are innate and less likely to be changed. All <br/>\nthe advice in the world won&#39;t matter if someone or something you love gets <br/>\nhurt. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck and let us know what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen and David Gehrke","from":"Kathleen and David Gehrke &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dog advice request","postDate":"1060829537","msgId":16148,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODE0MDI1MjE4LjQ0OTU3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxMzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5YS4xOTBiZjU4MC4yYzZjNTA3MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16147,"nextInTopic":16149,"prevInTime":16147,"nextInTime":16149,"topicId":16146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think pit bulls can be nice dogs.

I could call around and look <br/>\nfor a pit bull rescue group or something along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone want to talk me in or out of keeping a baby pit bull?  We already have <br/>\nan Australian cattle dog, five or six years old.  We have room, we can afford <br/>\nfood, she&#39;ll stop eating the toilet paper and kleenex eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s not really my kind of dog.  Holly likes her.  Keith&#39;s a soft-hearted <br/>\nguy.  Our cats had finally come home last night, and now the shy ones have gone <br/>\nback out to their far-yard hiding places.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just asked Kirby what he thinks.  He says he really likes her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d have to change her name.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16250,"nextTopicId":16238}}
