If this evolves into them being over here, do you recommend I put<br/>\nsomething in writing for the parents to sign acknowledging that I take no<br/>\nresponsibility for their sons&#39; learning? Seems like crazy/paranoid<br/>\nquestions, but they seem pretty real right now. Has anyone added their kids&#39;<br/>\nfriends from the p.s. system into their days as unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help!<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20969,"nextTopicId":20985}}
