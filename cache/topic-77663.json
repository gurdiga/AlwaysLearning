For money, over the years, she has done art (business cards, ads—computer graphics which she learned by playing around with KidPix and MySpace and doing things for fun), buying (art, for a shop), has worked in restaurants, breweries, as a janitor, at Walgreen’s (a pharmacy/late-night-convenience store with liquor) and now at a place that’s hard to describe—they do retreats, and serve some meals, she does cave tours, paperwork, bookkeeping, correspondence, reception (phone and in person).<br/>\n<br/>\nHer only training or certification is that she has a liquor server’s license for New Mexico.  She really understands the laws and is hard-nosed about it, so places she has worked have sent her to deal with problem buyers or problem drinkers, because she’s fine with saying, “No, can’t, sorry, the law says…”<br/>\n<br/>\nI can’t think of things that she did that didn’t contribute to what she knows and does now.  And the things she is learning doing this (and sharing houses, or sub-leasing, or renting little houses in little towns) is giving her an interest in what landlords can and could and must do for tenants.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of what she knows she has learned from conversations.  Most of the jobs she has had came from contacts.

This is totally typical regardless of whether she is ADHD or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this may not be her life-long interest, it would clearly be valuable in many fields. All the service industries, counseling, charity work, teaching draw on great people skills and most are light on math.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** We worry that she won&#39;t ever feel the need to learn what will be needed to make it on her own. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly other skills *aren’t* necessary right now. What is necessary to her current life is social skills and getting along with people. And that’s what she’s focusing on, isn’t she? So why do you fear that when she needs other skills that she’d avoid learning them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy *should* she learn what she doesn’t yet need? The foundation of unschooling is learning how to learn. Kids learn what they need as they need it. Through experience they’ve grown the confidence that they can learn what they need and don’t need knowledge before they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany (schooled) adults are filled with angst when faced with new situations. They feel they need to know a lot before they can try. But unschooled kids know that every new situation involves a period of learning. Throughout their lives every new interest, every new video game has involved a period of using what they know to learn what they need to know. And that’s how they grow the knowledge they need. To them that’s normal and expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 16 your daughter seems on the cusp of adulthood. But that’s school thinking. She’s 6 years away from the age most college graduates get their first job. Think back 6 years. What was your daughter like 6 years ago? She was 10. How far from who she is today did she seem then? Just because your daughter has a body that’s close to adult doesn’t mean her brain doesn’t have 6 more years of profound development. <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted this about my son Danny’s (though at the time Kathryn&#39;s) drawing development over the years. He spent a big huge chunk of his childhood drawing. That would suggest he’d be masterful by 16. Yet his drawings still lacked maturity. (Admittedly he focused on an anime style, but artistically there’s still great room for growth.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see a typical example at the link and a typical example just 4 years later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-am-I-so-bad-at-everything/answer/Joyce-Fetteroll\">https://www.quora.com/Why-am-I-so-bad-at-everything/answer/Joyce-Fetteroll</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is the big difference isn’t from practice. (He was drawing for *hours*.) It’s from huge changes that happen in the brain between 16 and 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter is 16, doing 16  year old things. At 20 and 22 she will be a different person. Just as my son drew like a 16 year old when he was 16. And when he was 20 he drew like a 20 year old. Those 4 years made a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262895925,"authorName":"Sam","from":"Sam &lt;rainmountain1@...&gt;","profile":"rainmountain1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need Input On How to View Child&#39;s (Lack of) Interests in a Positive Way","postDate":"1485436818","msgId":77668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGMjI5NjE5LUMyOUQtNERENC1CRThGLTAzQzhGMUMxRTlCOEB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG82Ymc0aCticDAybHRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG82Ymc0aCticDAybHRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77666,"nextInTopic":77669,"prevInTime":77667,"nextInTime":77669,"topicId":77663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just to offer the perspective that she sounds awesome, how wonderful she has the confidence to go out in the world on her own and work and meet people.
