The point is that a child that isn&#39;t needy or overly controlled is probably going to make very wise decisions about their own bodies and when the time is right for them. I don&#39;t know of ANY 13y.o.&#39;s raised in the manner being discussed here that wanted to begin sexual relationships that young.<br/>\nMaybe there&#39;s one out there. I think they&#39;d be the exception rather than the rule.<br/>\nOn the other hand, kids that are needy or feeling the need to rebel are the most likely candidates to have sex before they&#39;re really ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a 13 y.o. decides to have sex, how are you planning to stop them? I accept that I can&#39;t control another human being. I&#39;d rather have a child that trusts me to respect their choices and is willing to talk serious issues over with me rather than do things secretively.<br/>\nI have WAY more influence over my child&#39;s world by treating them with respect, than if I tried to control them...that&#39;s the cool part.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 y.o. is no more ready for sex right now than he is marriage! He&#39;s happy and comfortable with his life and understands the deep level of intimacy sex can bring. He and I talk about these issues openly...he knows I&#39;m not trying to control him so he can talk freely without fear of condemnation.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18225,"nextTopicId":18262}}
