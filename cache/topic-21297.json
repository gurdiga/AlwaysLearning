We have 4 ds ages 16, 13, 8 and 6. We&#39;ve unschooled from the start via the writings of John Holt, Grace Lewellyn, John Taylor Gatto, Sandra Dodd, and others. (shyly waving at Sandra ;-)  We just try to live the richest life we can and do what we love. We&#39;ve only been connected to the net for about 3 years now, and have flown &#39;under the radar&#39; until this year if you get my drift. (still cautious about saying that) Anyway...LOVE this list....been lurking about 6 months. My 2 teens are totally immersed in studying web design, so we have 2 computers going with 1 extra phone line between them. I jump on as I can and have narrowed my lists down to this one. It&#39;s my favorite, and I&#39;d love to add a word or two once in awhile if ya&#39;ll don&#39;t mind. :-) Still learning list etiquette, so let me know if I mess up. You have some great advice bouncing around on here. I think John Holt would be proud. (BWG)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it&#39;s a beautiful day and we all have (literally) cabin fever...so we&#39;re gonna hit the woods for a hike.
