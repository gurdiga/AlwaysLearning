My husband and I started trying to get her to stop a few years ago prior to unschooling.  We have been unschooling for about a year now.  When we were able to get her to stop through coercion and other not so pretty ways, she started heavily masturbating.  Clearly she needs an outlet.  <br>\n<br>I have given up trying to get her to quit because through unschooling I now realize that I would rather have a good relationship with her than see her stop.  My concern is that her breath is atrocious and her front teeth are really protruding.  We have not taken her to an orthodontist yet.  I think she is still too young.  Any thoughts?

She wrapped it up in tape, I mean the only thing that she didn&#39;t do was chop it off. Still today, after a marriage and two children,  there are times when I still want to suck on my thumb to be quite honest. I think that if she has that need, you should just let her. It will stop when she is ready for it to stop.<br>\n\nLast Summer I went to a festival in which I met a chiropractor. During his session,  he explained the importance that thumb suction has in development. I was stunned! <br>\nIt turns out that by sucking the thumb the muscles of the back of the neck get to fully develop, and that is something important for the human body. He actually had all 35 people sucking our thumbs by the end of the session!<br>\n\nI made the mistake of making my daughter stop. Knowing what I know now, I much rather know that her neck got fully developed. So if your daughter has that need, and she know what she  needs, let her. If her breath isn&#39;t pleasant,  talk to her about hygiene,  and as far as the teeth, braces can fix that. Another thing could be that you offer her Popsicles, lollipops, ice cream,  and other things that can satisfy that need, without making it a big deal. Explain to her about the sugar content of those foods and let her know that brushing her teeth after will help her teeth stay healthy.<br>\n\nSometimes,  getting caught up in cosmetics,  we miss the big picture,  but the teeth are just cosmetics and it can be fixed at the right time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">H.</p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-705932962gmail_quote\">On Jan 4, 2014 1:28 AM, &quot;Sherry Franklin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sherryfranklin150@...\">sherryfranklin150@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-705932962gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"top\">My daughter is nine years old and sucks her thumb.

For me-- a recovering people pleaser-- this can be hard to bear.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t worry about your daughter&#39;s thumb sucking.  There are MANY worse ways to self soothe.  Children eventually outgrow the need for it-- at least I don&#39;t know of any adult thumb suckers-- and when they do, we parents can consider braces. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son is thirteen.  He is bright, outgoing, and happy.  Unlike his younger brothers, however, he has always loved to suck his thumb.  He began sucking his thumb in utero; and like your daughter, it is a source of great comfort to him.  He rarely sucks his thumb in public.  None of his friends know of this habit.  However, when he is sleepy, he still sucks his thumb.  And yes, he needs braces.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last year, he told me he would like to stop thumb sucking.  I asked if he would like me to gently bring it to his attention whenever I noticed him doing it.  He said yes.  So now whenever I see him sucking his thumb (usually only on a long car ride when he is getting tired or late at night when he is curled up on the couch watching a movie) I will quietly smile and say, &quot;Thumb.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important not to shame our children or suggest that they are failures or babies for continuing this habit.  Although it may affect the teeth, the teeth can be fixed.  As you suggested, your child&#39;s trust in your love and support is far more important.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherry Franklin &lt;sherryfranklin150@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter is nine years old and sucks her thumb.
