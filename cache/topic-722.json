I looked through it a few<br/>\nweeks ago.  I was struck by a) how vague it is;  b) how poorly written it<br/>\nis,  and c) how it seems to glorify some behaviors that would likely put<br/>\nmost people into serious psychiatric treatment.  Like, as a child, St.<br/>\n(Catherine of Sienna?)  allegedly locked herself in her bedroom for three<br/>\nyears,  and didn&#39;t speak. OTOH,  I respect thise who choose a monastic life.<br/>\nCan hardly think a child in today&#39;s U.S.  would manage to pull this off.<br/>\nAnd I remember a college prof talking about St. Catherine&#39;s nursing the sick<br/>\nby &#39;sucking out the pus from the cancerous breasts of the sick.&quot;  ( I mean<br/>\nno offense to anyone here!)  Recently,  we were trying out a &quot;Family Faith<br/>\nGathering&quot;....the topic was saints and when someone asked if I recalled<br/>\nanything about St. C,  that was all I could think of!<br/>\n    S...who&#39;s curiosity on this is going to cause a late night tonight, I<br/>\nfear!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what of religions that practice meditation, or use drugs<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sacramentally?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My religion&#39;s hagiography is replete with saints whose visions could be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; as easily described as hallucinations; were they just nuts, or can severe<br/>\n&gt; fasting account for them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Something to ponder at this season of The Incarnation ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nancy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
