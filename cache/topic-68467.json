There&#39;s some research that natural schedules run longer than 24hrs but are modified by daylight, and a bunch of theories as to why some people don&#39;t seem to &quot;reset&quot; every day, but the short answer is: some people are like that, no-one really knows why.

He has never fought going to sleep either. When he is tired he&#39;ll sleep and makes it very clear that he does not want to be woken up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of going along with it, to see what happens. I guess that at a certain point his nap will be so late that it will become his night time sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main issue is that we live in a small holiday bungalow with thin walls and my husband needs his sleep. My son is too young to understand that and cannot be quiet at night. We watch movies as much as possible and I nurse him as much as possible to help him be quiet. I also keep my voice down, do quiet things and remind him that daddy is asleep. Physically he is quiet, but verbally he just can&#39;t keep his voice down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if he cannot be quiet, he cannot stay up later than his dad. But then what? Going to sleep has never been an issue and I don&#39;t want to create any!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has been getting less physical activity lately as it&#39;s very hot outside and crowded with tourists - two things he does not like - and prefers to stay inside to do art/crafts and watch movies/Youtube. And he has discovered the joys of verbal communication :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t know what else could have to do with this change... Is this a normal thing to happen, once in while, when there are no enforced bedtimes? Or am I missing something crucial in his development, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68508,"nextTopicId":68529}}
