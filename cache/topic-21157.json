We<br/>\ncan either play up the learning processes involved or simply describe a task<br/>\nand still be truthfully talking about the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mentioned that my little guys chose to go to Kindergarten this year.<br/>\nThey were supposed to bring apples to school.  They took turns weighing the<br/>\napples and seeing which type was heavier or lighter, etc..  This is<br/>\nobviously learning and we describe it as such talking to grandparents,<br/>\nfamily, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we go to the grocery store, the kids have weighed produce in the scales<br/>\nsince they were old enough to put it in.  We talked about whether carrots or<br/>\ngrapes weighed more, etc..  But when talking to family about what we did, I<br/>\nwould more likely say &quot;Oh, we just did some grocery shopping.&quot;  It is still<br/>\nobviously learning but we don&#39;t tend to describe it that way when talking to<br/>\npeople.  The only difference is that at home, Danny didn&#39;t have to wait four<br/>\ndays for all the kids at his table to remember their apples before he could<br/>\nweigh his &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elizabeth Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 14, 2004 12:42 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;m new here and could use some help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suggest he read &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting,&quot; by Frank Smith.**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with Nancy that this is a great book.
