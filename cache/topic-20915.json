I&#39;ve always talked<br/>\n&gt; about these cultural issues when I thought about or read about them and so<br/>\n&gt; this is not a new discussion. I also believe - and share that belief that<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; you are willing to take the consequences then do what you want - as long<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; you aren&#39;t physically invading someone. If the other person can walk away<br/>\n&gt; then do what you want but be prepared for the likely consequences. I make<br/>\n&gt; sure they really get what the consequences are and if they complain later<br/>\n&gt; about the consequences, I offer what I would to a friend - options about<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; to change opinions of others - we do a lot of brainstorming about these<br/>\n&gt; things.

They are comfortable with me and act<br/>\nthemselves around me, but my own sons seem to know intuitively that I&#39;m not<br/>\ncrazy about them swearing a lot (like you, probably because I don&#39;t swear<br/>\nall that much) but I&#39;ve noticed more and more it is part of their talk now<br/>\nwith their friends.

I would<br/>\nlove to  hear others&#39; thoughts however :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nI&#39;ve always just tried to demystify cuss words.  (I&#39;m from  Arkansas.  Cuss <br/>\nis an actual word. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nKids at different times become enamored with the idea of cussing and they  do <br/>\nit.  I&#39;ve offered a chance for my 10 yo to go in a room or somewhere no  one <br/>\nwill hear him, and just scream out all the cuss words he can think of.   He <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t take me up on it.  At 10, many kids are way too modest and shy  and <br/>\nafraid to break the &quot;rules&quot;, even if there very few rules.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I had offered that at 6 (a time when he probably knew very few cuss  <br/>\nwords), he probably would have taken me up on it.   :)<br/>\n <br/>\nBut just talking about the idea of shouting out cuss words has helped take  <br/>\nthe mystery from them.  We talk about what they mean.  I say them, he  tries to <br/>\nforce himself to say them.  We make up euphemisms for them (cuss  words are <br/>\nusually euphemisms for something else, so that&#39;s interesting,  too).  &quot;Holy <br/>\nShit-ake mushrooms!&quot;  We make up jokes with almost-cuss  words in them, or sing <br/>\nsongs that we know have cuss words in them.  He  still will bleep out the word <br/>\nhell in a Barenaked ladies song that we  know.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have grown sons, and they both had a fascination with cuss words at  one <br/>\ntime or another.  I used to joke that they could cuss when they had  whiskers on <br/>\ntheir face.  Of course, it was many years after they started  using cuss <br/>\nwords before they had whiskers.  When they were teenagers I  tried to make them <br/>\naware that some words just don&#39;t sound appropriate out of the  mouth of their 4 <br/>\nyo brother, so to please use discretion.  But they had  already learned <br/>\ndiscretion by using them in the wrong place, or being told when  it was okay and <br/>\nwhen it was not.  It wasn&#39;t hard for them to pick that  up.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t really care if my kids swear.  I swear.  I don&#39;t swear in  front of <br/>\npeople who would take offense, or I try not to.  Today I used the  term &quot;pissed <br/>\noff&quot; in front of some little kids that I didn&#39;t know well, and  while no one <br/>\nsaid anything or seemed to care, *I* felt like I should have  censored my <br/>\nlanguage, and at least shown some respect for the fact that I didn&#39;t  know how <br/>\ntheir parents would feel about it.  All of my sons have leaned  that direction, <br/>\nrather than cussing with abandon no matter where they are.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144190534,"authorName":"Sondra Carr","from":"&quot;Sondra Carr&quot; &lt;sondracarr@...&gt;","profile":"sondra66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] swearing","postDate":"1096322691","msgId":20917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTMwMWM0YTRkZSQwMzQwMGEwMCQ2NTAxYThjMEB5b3VyMndwMjFuM296Nz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVPSENKQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":20916,"nextInTopic":20918,"prevInTime":20916,"nextInTime":20918,"topicId":20915,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I handle this the same way that I handle my son wanting to wear dresses - explain that I probably cringe because I ve been conditioned a certain way but that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2137265952\">I handle this the same way that I handle my son wanting to wear dresses -<br/>\nexplain that I probably cringe because I&#39;ve been conditioned a certain way<br/>\nbut that logically there is no real reason that certain words are worse than<br/>\nothers.
