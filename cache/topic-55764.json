Lots of kids go through phases of being awake late at night - why isn&#39;t this child simply a child? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably wasn&#39;t the parent&#39;s intention to write something dehumanizing, but that&#39;s the danger of seeing a person through the lens of a label - it becomes appallingly easy to frame everything about that person in terms of the label. Sometimes even &quot;child&quot; can be too much of a label, when it gets in the way of seeing human reactions and motivations. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55593,"nextTopicId":55751}}
