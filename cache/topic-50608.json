It felt like I&#39;d just turned the world upside down, I didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s how it felt.  Five yr olds are supposed to go to kindergarten, moms are supposed to have their heart felt, teary good byes to their little ones on their first day of school.  Right?  So, when I decided not to do that, it felt really big to me.  The weird thing, kindergarten didn&#39;t even exist here when I was 5, unless you put your child in a private school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of husbands are really unfamiliar with child development in general.  A lot dads expect more from their little ones than they are developmentally able to give.  Just because a 4 yr old can read, doesn&#39;t mean she can wipe herself after going to the toilet, for example.  When my oldest didn&#39;t go to school for kindergarten, her best friend was being put in all the Talented and Gifted programs because she already knew how to read.  Same age, same general developmental abilities, same abilities to think, both girls played house and imagination games, but with the one significant difference of one  being able to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents totally buy into this too, that a child is somehow extra special if they learn how to read early.  Today, both those girls are 15, both are still smart and able to think and reason, each of them have interesting talents, both of them can read, my daughter is still not in school and the other girl still is.  What this other girl has that my daughter doesn&#39;t, lots and lots and lots of homework for her upper level, talented classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I think a lot of his concern stems from worrying about what other people will think when they find out we are homeschooling. Like, that we&#39;re a bunch of weirdos, or that we&#39;re lazy, or that we are socially awkward, or religious wackos, or any number of typical stereotypes. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those folks exist in schools too, weirdo parents, lazy parents, socially awkward parents, religious wacko parents.  Homeschoolers represent a cross section of society, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve found over the years.  It might help your husband a great deal to see your daughter playing with other homeschool kids, and even other school kids, so he can kind of see the differences in play and interaction and to get a feel for how kids in general ARE.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Help Talking with Spouse About Unschooling","postDate":"1265824805","msgId":50619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3MzczMC4zNzgzNC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhrdXExYStqY3Y2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhrdXExYStqY3Y2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50618,"nextInTopic":50621,"prevInTime":50618,"nextInTime":50620,"topicId":50608,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband has read some of Rue s book and  that helped too.

The library is still one of her favorite places as she has never been forced to read, read aloud, discuss what she doesn&#39;t want to, read specific bks on a timetable, or been classified as gifted/slow etc.  I think she felt supported in that I&#39;d just answer her questions (not say &quot;look it up&quot; in the dictionary, etc).  She is now 12.  Some of her schooled friends seem to lose a kind of spark/enthusiasm for certain things like joining book clubs, reading in general, etc.  Maybe because they have so much required of them in school?  I love that my daughter has a continued interest in reading and knows she can learn what she wants to when and if she wants to (and in many different ways, not just from reading).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I simply responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something  along the lines of I shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her -<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the case of a math question, perhaps your daughter felt nervous counting in front of her dad as she might sense his anxiety.  Or maybe she is just asking because she forgot for a second and wanted a quick answer and assumed she could rely on you or her dad to provide it?  Either way, answering the simple question (assuming we know the answer) helps us build trust as our kids learn they can depend on us yet again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband already knows some of the many things your daughter has learned.  Can he trust her longer to notice her make more &quot;progress?&quot;  If it would help him, books are available that show what is generally taught in what grade (Nancy Plent has them -<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschoolersnetwork.bravehost.com/guides.html)\">http://www.unschoolersnetwork.bravehost.com/guides.html)</a>  Maybe he&#39;d see that she knows much of it already and realize she&#39;d be bored.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo help think about how parents generally treat their children, might he be willing to watch &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by Alfie Kohn?

Although we have homeschooled since 1987 (I am 2nd generation), we have &#39;unschooled&#39; our children for 10 years, from birth.  I have really not explained our methods to anyone because we do not have any!  We just live and learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis website was very confusing to me.  It seemed VERY political and was not geared toward homeschooling at all.  They seem to be advocating a mobile wireless device as the &quot;global knowledge commons network&quot;.  I unschool because I want to facilitate my chidren&#39;s education not have them learn everything from a portable internet device. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would most definitely not recommend this site to anyone who is confused/unsupportive of unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis quote alone was enough to make me stop reading the web page and write this note to the group:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, our children need a place to spend the day.<br/>\nYes, our kids need to learn to socialize with each other.<br/>\nYes, students need to articulate, discourse, and compete.<br/>\nYes, our youngsters need to have teachers guide them to knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the above has to do with the fact that knowledge has moved online.<br/>\nNonetheless, billions are spent every year perpetuating a system of local schools where kids are required by law to spend their days, in a system that is based on the assumption that we send our kids to school to learn knowledge and be certified to their achievement.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids DO NOT NEED any of the above that cannot be provided in a safe, loving home environment.  Has the author ever heard of homeschooling?  My children are not required by any law in this country to spend their days in a government system.  In fact, the laws are just the opposite; I have the freedom to choose what is best for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have enjoyed this site, although I am new here!  I have also read several Dodd and Holt books as well as other authors.  We use our daily lives to educate our children.  We facilitate their education with activities and books and computers from home and away.  We do use the internet and I don&#39;t think our children are suffering from a lack of global knowledge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was very disappointed with the recommendation of this website.  Thank you, Sandra, for requesting that this site be used for unschooling issues.

If  <br/>\nyou have memories of being that age, maybe tell a story, one or two,  <br/>\nand then let it lie, give him a few days to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he seems intent on looking at school, ask him to wait a year.  A  <br/>\nyear is a lot of days, and it&#39;s probably better not to press  <br/>\nunschooling *every* day, in his direction.   Let him think about the  <br/>\nlittle things you do say or point out about your daughter&#39;s learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting him around other kids her age would help.  Getting him around  <br/>\nother unschoolers might help a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":374014398,"authorName":"melissamariemichael","from":"&quot;melissamariemichael&quot; &lt;myatzeck@...&gt;","profile":"melissamariemichael","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Help Talking with Spouse About Unschooling","postDate":"1265800136","msgId":50608,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhrdTQ0OCt1Zms0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50609,"prevInTime":50607,"nextInTime":50609,"topicId":50608,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m having some issues with my husband not being fully on board with how I feel about homeschooling/unschooling and was hoping for some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1815237129\">I&#39;m having some issues with my husband not being fully on board with how I feel about homeschooling/unschooling and was hoping for some resources/advice/information on talking to him about the subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter Mary is turning 4 next week, and we&#39;ve already got some notices in the mail about how she is now eligible for 4K programs and inviting us to open houses and the like.  I&#39;ve been talking about homeschooling/unschooling with my husband for some time now, but it seems it&#39;s all about to become very real.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, I&#39;m afraid, is second-guessing our decision to keep our daughter home from school.  There have been several occasions during the past couple of weeks where she has wanted to do something (like watch a movie, or play on the computer) and he has told her that she should should do something to &quot;use your brain&quot; instead.  I don&#39;t like this phrase at all.  I mean, it&#39;s not like her brain shuts off when she&#39;s watching a movie or looking at the computer.  I know for certain that she learns tons of stuff doing those things.  I&#39;m fairly certain that playing on the computer has been a huge part of how she learned to read.  He has also made comments to me about how he thinks our daughter is &quot;regressing,&quot; meaning that she used to be smarter and now she isn&#39;t.  This blows my mind.  I mean, we have a 3 year old that can READ for crying out loud.  She&#39;s very bright, and interesting, and creative, and all sorts of great things.  Even if she couldn&#39;t read, she&#39;s still awesome.  I think that his feelings like this are fleeting (meaning he doesn&#39;t feel that way all the time) and stem from his own insecurities about not sending her to school the way everyone else is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt especially bothers me that sometimes he says things like this when she is in earshot.  The example I am thinking of happened earlier today when we were riding in the car.  Mary was in the back seat counting out loud just for the fun of it, and she got to 29 and asked me what number comes next.  I simply responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something along the lines of I shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her and that she knows better than that and that maybe she needs to go to school because she&#39;s &quot;regressing.&quot;  Now I *know* that Mary can count past 30 because I&#39;ve heard her do it lots of times.  Mary knows she can count past 30, and my husband knows it too.  So who cares if she asks what comes after 29 when we&#39;re riding in the car?  It&#39;s not like everything is a test and we need to keep quizzing her.  I distinctly remember being quizzed on counting out loud in kindergarten, and being so into it that I would draw out the nine and forget what set of tens I was on.  For example, &quot;twenty-eight, twenty-niiiiiiiiiiine, THIRTY!&quot;  Sometimes that &quot;niiiiiiiine&quot; would be so long I would forget if I was on the twenties or thirties or whatever and mess up.  I would get upset because I knew how to count up into the hundreds, but the teacher would make me stop because I had made a mistake.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what was going on with Mary, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.  I told him that Mary is definitely NOT regressing and that he definitely shouldn&#39;t ever say things like that in front of her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of his concern stems from worrying about what other people will think when they find out we are homeschooling.  Like, that we&#39;re a bunch of weirdos, or that we&#39;re lazy, or that we are socially awkward, or religious wackos, or any number of typical stereotypes.  To me, I don&#39;t really worry about what other people will think.  If they are people we don&#39;t know really well, then who cares?  If they are people we do know really well, then they will see that we aren&#39;t any of those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can I help him to understand?  When I wanted to relax a lot of our rules about food with Mary, I printed off a few pages with excerpts from Sandra&#39;s site and left them for him to find.  (I&#39;m strewing for my husband!)  This seemed to work really well.  For some reason, I&#39;m having trouble knowing what to give him for this issue because it&#39;s not as narrow as &quot;food&quot; and I&#39;m not certain what would help him best.  I can&#39;t really just point him to Sandra&#39;s site because it&#39;s so huge that I think it would be overwhelming.  (Though I LOVE that it&#39;s huge and I&#39;m always finding new things on there!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n~Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50707,"nextTopicId":50648}}
