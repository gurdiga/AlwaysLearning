Pam Sorooshian, Jill Parmer and I will be the primary presenters this summer, but there will be panels and discussions with some or all of our kids, and others.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/all/registration\">http://sandradodd.com/all/registration</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are people here who never post, and some people don&#39;t like the quick text chats*, and some people truly prefer being in person at a more leisurely pace, where they can perceive things other than words, words, words.  So a symposium where people can listen, and ask questions, or just observe interactions, can be valuable (even to those who tend to write, write, write).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen in winter, Joyce Fetteroll and Deb Lewis will be in Albuquerque for Always Learning Live #2.<br/>\nNext summer, Schuyler Waynforth and her husband, David, and their children, will be featured.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven for those who can&#39;t attend at all, there&#39;s a coloring-contest opportunity (Holly says &quot;call it art modification, not &#39;coloring contest&#39;&quot;), and that&#39;s lower down on that page.    Anyone who wants to take a shot at messing with/improving/riffing on that logo could get attention (at least) or a prize.  I will share any art that&#39;s sent to me, and do various cool things with some of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people find value in meeting some of the people they&#39;re &quot;reading,&quot; and in seeing longtime unschooing families interacting in person. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, Kirby, will turn 25 during the conference and we&#39;ll have a party for him there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(* There continue to be two weekly text chats, too.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/room\">http://sandradodd.com/room</a> )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60073,"nextTopicId":60269}}
