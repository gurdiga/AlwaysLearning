The girls are 16<br/>\nand 14. And do you know what? We are still seeing the effects of that<br/>\ntime they spent in school. Chloe is an instinctive mathematician who<br/>\nbefore school used to beg us to give her story problems to do. Then came<br/>\nthe awful day when she came home from school and announced that she<br/>\nhated math. She is only now getting over her resistance to &quot;formal&quot; math<br/>\n(as opposed to real life math, which she does all the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you might imagine, my strongest advice to you as parents of young<br/>\nchildren is &quot;Don&#39;t send your kids to school.&quot; Any school, public or<br/>\nprivate, can lead to the kind of damage we&#39;ve seen in our kids. We<br/>\nthought trying school would be a harmless experiment, something we could<br/>\nchange our minds about if needed, but we did lasting harm to our kids&#39;<br/>\ncuriosity and natural joy in learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe post is mostly about convincing someone to NOT send their kids to<br/>\nschool and it has some local stuff at the bottom.
