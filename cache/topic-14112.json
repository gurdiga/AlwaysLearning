Topics of discussion frequently include how to avoid an unnecessary cesarean, preparing for VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean), healing and grieving from a difficult or traumatic previous birth, how to find a caregiver who is supportive of vaginal birth and VBAC, informed consent, childbirth education, the role of doulas and midwives, birth stories, etc. The list is made up primarily of mothers, in addition to some doulas, midwives, childbirth educators, and occasionally fathers. You can choose to receive all messages posted to the group as individual emails, or grouped together in digests. When you join the list, please offer an introduction to the group, perhaps through telling your birth stories or explaining your interest in ICAN.
