We eventually linked it back to the fire alarm drills thay <br/>\ndo at playschool. Ever since then,  that fear stuck with him for <br/>\nmany years. Those were the days whereby he absolutely will not stay <br/>\nonce he spots the fire alarm. It actually got worse whereby if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t see it, he thinks it&#39;s hidden somewhere, and will still <br/>\ninsist on going home. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring our unschooling, we stayed home pretty much or if we do go <br/>\nout, it is mostly to the park, I guessed he finally forgotten about <br/>\nthat fear, plus he is alittle bit older now, so he understands <br/>\nbetter the meaning of sirens and fire alarms. With everything going <br/>\nso well, I kinda forgot about his fear LOL!!    <br/>\n<br/>\nThis now reminds me of something I&#39;ve read a long time ago, about <br/>\nallowing the child to work thru thier fears by touching the object <br/>\nof fear, talkabout it or playing with it. It is when we remove the <br/>\nobject of fear that&#39;s when the fear will be stuck as such, forever. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I can see now it may be deeper than just some science <br/>\nexperiments. So there we go, another example of unschooling working <br/>\nit&#39;s magic. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all those talk about smoking food is getting ME really excited. <br/>\nHmmm...not into smoke meat but I&#39;m gonna get some cheese and get the <br/>\nkids to smoke it, for my snack LOL!

Books with a lot of pictures might be more<br/>\nenjoyable for her and easier to make the story real.  It sounded as<br/>\nthough you were saying that she can read.  If she is very visual, I<br/>\nthink books with pictures and movies might be a better direction to go<br/>\nthan books on tape.  Books on tape might be harder.  Offering them and<br/>\nseeing what she likes is probably the best way to find out, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to try manga, &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; might be a nice one to start<br/>\nwith.   There is also an anime version that she might enjoy.  Ranma is<br/>\nalso a lot of fun - rather silly and a lot of physical humor (anime<br/>\nand manga for this one as well).   Comics like Garfield might be<br/>\nenjoyable as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wondered if she is choosing age appropriate books because she<br/>\nfeels as though she should.  Maybe you could encourage her to look at<br/>\nother things that are easier to read.  Fairy tales with lots of<br/>\npictures might be enjoyable for her.  They are simpler and more visual<br/>\nwithout seeming childish.  I read books illustrated by Susan Jeffers<br/>\nwhen I was younger and they are nice versions of the stories.  Perhaps<br/>\nyou could find other picture books that can be fun for adults too -<br/>\nshare them with the whole family.  Perhaps if she sees her sisters and<br/>\nyou reading things like that it will seem OK for her to do it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the Miyazaki movies might be fun and adults like them too.<br/>\n&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery service&quot; and &quot;Spirited Away&quot;<br/>\nare the ones my daughter loves (she is 5) and I do as well.  The first<br/>\ntwo have fairly simple plots.  All of them are very interesting,<br/>\nvisually.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounded as though she enjoys dance.  What else does she enjoy<br/>\ndoing?  What kind of video games does she enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Oct 26, 2008 at 4:59 PM, bigforkmom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:green@...\">green@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for the responses, and especially the direction to a<br/>\n&gt; number of links.

I have no clue what my other seven children&#39;s IQ<br/>\n&gt; scores are, or mine, or my husband&#39;s. It would never, never occur<br/>\n&gt; to me to even consider testing one of the other children. But<br/>\n&gt; this child is struggling in ways I&#39;ve never encountered. We have<br/>\n&gt; no medical history of her before we adopted her when she was six.<br/>\n&gt; We have no information as to what she might have been exposed to in<br/>\n&gt; utero. We do know, however, that something is clearly limiting her<br/>\n&gt; abilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra asked if she has access to using money. Of course. She<br/>\n&gt; gets an allowance and is expected to pay for certain expenses, such<br/>\n&gt; as going to movies, buying gifts for friends, buying snacks and much<br/>\n&gt; more. We play board games routinely. She helps me in the kitchen<br/>\n&gt; with preparing meals that involve the use of recipes in cookbooks.<br/>\n&gt; She has a digital watch, digital alarm clock, calendars, appointment<br/>\n&gt; books. There are areas in which she hasn&#39;t been able to make<br/>\n&gt; connections that I would think would be fairly normal for a fifteen<br/>\n&gt; year old.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example, she can&#39;t count the money in her wallet. She doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know if she has enough money to make a purchase. If she has two<br/>\n&gt; tens, three fives, and seven ones, plus change, she won&#39;t know if<br/>\n&gt; she can buy something that costs $12 because there is no $12<br/>\n&gt; bill. When counting coins, if she has three quarters and three<br/>\n&gt; dimes, she can&#39;t figure out how much that is. I have tried to help<br/>\n&gt; her make these connections in as many ways as I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She cannot keep days of the week straight from months of the year.<br/>\n&gt; She can&#39;t name all the months and she doesn&#39;t know what month<br/>\n&gt; Christmas occurs in. She can&#39;t get the connection as to what<br/>\n&gt; month comes after December. We use calendars all the time, trying<br/>\n&gt; to present ideas that much younger children are typically absorbing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recently she was helping as an usher at a ballet performance for an<br/>\n&gt; out-of-town touring company. She couldn&#39;t direct people to their<br/>\n&gt; seats because she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet well enough to recognize<br/>\n&gt; where the different letters will fall in the rows at the theatre.<br/>\n&gt; She literally was taking people to the front of the auditorium, then<br/>\n&gt; advancing up the stairs until she got to the correct row.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When helping me cook, she can&#39;t differentiate between the different<br/>\n&gt; sized measuring cups. If asked to add two-thirds cups of sugar to<br/>\n&gt; a recipe, she will be frustrated because there is no two thirds cup<br/>\n&gt; in our collection. She doesn&#39;t understand that you could fill the<br/>\n&gt; one-third cup twice. This is after cooking with me daily for<br/>\n&gt; years. She can&#39;t figure fractions using pies or pizzas. She has<br/>\n&gt; not been able to prepare meals for herself that require mixing<br/>\n&gt; ingredients that need any degree of measuring. She was mixing a<br/>\n&gt; box of brownie mix the other day that called for two tablespoons of<br/>\n&gt; oil, and she didn&#39;t know how much that was. I handed her the set<br/>\n&gt; of measuring spoons, and that was no help because there isn&#39;t one<br/>\n&gt; specifically labeled two tablespoons. We&#39;ve been mixing these<br/>\n&gt; brownies for years. Virtually every two weeks I&#39;ll explain that we<br/>\n&gt; fill the tablespoon two times. She cannot figure out how to double<br/>\n&gt; a recipe, even though she will be at my side while I do this and I<br/>\n&gt; talk through the process.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are six of us at the table routinely, but our older kids join<br/>\n&gt; us fairly often. If I tell her that her older brother and his<br/>\n&gt; wife will be coming and ask her to set extra places, she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how many places to set. But she can add six and two.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me add, I&#39;m not making any of these activities &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Board and card games are routine around here. But she needs our<br/>\n&gt; help to participate, just as we would have helped one of the kids<br/>\n&gt; when they were five or six year olds, just learning a game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She doesn&#39;t understand the concepts of before and after. Recently<br/>\n&gt; her ballet teacher asked her to come an hour early for a costume<br/>\n&gt; fitting, and she didn&#39;t have a clue as to what time that would be.<br/>\n&gt; If a movie starts at six and lasts two hours, she won&#39;t know when it<br/>\n&gt; is over. She can read a digital clock, but she can&#39;t connect how<br/>\n&gt; many minutes it will be until something starts. If we plan to<br/>\n&gt; leave the house at 3:15, and it&#39;s 2:45, she won&#39;t know how lont it<br/>\n&gt; is until we leave.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She can&#39;t read a thermometer. She can&#39;t use a calendar to see how<br/>\n&gt; many days it will be until an event. She doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>\n&gt; figure the number of days when going from, oh, let&#39;s say the 25&#39;th<br/>\n&gt; of one month to the 3rd of the next, even with a calendar in front<br/>\n&gt; of her. Recently she asked when her next hair appointment was,<br/>\n&gt; and I said that I had written it on the calendar, and she had no<br/>\n&gt; idea that if it wasn&#39;t on the current page that it might be on the<br/>\n&gt; next. She didn&#39;t see an appointment written in October, and she<br/>\n&gt; had no concept of looking at November. We&#39;re going to Florida in<br/>\n&gt; January and she doesn&#39;t know if that is before or after Christmas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She seeks out age appropriate books, but she has never been able to<br/>\n&gt; talk about the content. She can&#39;t participate in real<br/>\n&gt; conversations with people, so she does lots of diversional tactics<br/>\n&gt; like saying things that she knows are silly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She loves computer games that are totally visual, but can&#39;t move<br/>\n&gt; beyond to any that require strategic thinking. And she can&#39;t play<br/>\n&gt; basic board games that require any strategy. She likes movies and<br/>\n&gt; tv but can&#39;t participate in any family discussion on what is going<br/>\n&gt; on. We will make predictions as to what we think might happen in<br/>\n&gt; an ongoing series, and she clearly doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her speech and language issues are similar to those you would expect<br/>\n&gt; with an adult who had suffered a stroke. Every professional she<br/>\n&gt; has encountered believe she has suffered some type of brain injury,<br/>\n&gt; either before or after birth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason I&#39;m raising all this is that I&#39;m not sure about what<br/>\n&gt; parents of children with severe developmental disabilities do with<br/>\n&gt; respect to unschooling. While I have confidence that the other<br/>\n&gt; girls learn a great deal from normal family activities, I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; confident that this particular chid is able to function at that<br/>\n&gt; level. So, my question is, would you recommend unschooling for a<br/>\n&gt; child who has a significant developmental disability? Anyone who<br/>\n&gt; spends time with my daughter knows that there is a major problem,<br/>\n&gt; but we don&#39;t have a diagnosis. We know that she will likely<br/>\n&gt; never be able to live independently, although our hope is that she<br/>\n&gt; will be able to have a job outside a &quot;sheltered work environment.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; We have been advised to provide a financial plan with guardians for<br/>\n&gt; her inheritance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any confidence that anything I&#39;ve done so far has<br/>\n&gt; helped much. I moved away from anything approaching formal work<br/>\n&gt; with her a long time ago, because it was so frustrating for her. I<br/>\n&gt; try to keep things as low key, non-threatening as possible because I<br/>\n&gt; want to keep pressure off out of concern for her self image, which<br/>\n&gt; has already been damaged pretty badly because of the abuse she faced<br/>\n&gt; in the orphanage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I probably am coming off as defensive, and I probably am, because<br/>\n&gt; people keep telling me what works with their kids who have ADD or<br/>\n&gt; dyslexia or are autistic, and none of these apply to a child who<br/>\n&gt; possibly has brain damage and a signifant developmental disability.<br/>\n&gt; A friend whose child has Downs told me it&#39;s actually easier in some<br/>\n&gt; ways for her because her child&#39;s disability is visual. Our<br/>\n&gt; daughter has something going on in her brain that is very real, but<br/>\n&gt; we can&#39;t diagnose it or find a particular therapy to use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elaine </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Shifting from mom-directed homeschooling","postDate":"1225129116","msgId":39651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEREMDlGQUM0LUU3RjEtNDA0NC1BQzY2LTNFM0VBMjQ1RTBDM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlNG91bitnN3FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlNG91bitnN3FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39648,"nextInTopic":39654,"prevInTime":39650,"nextInTime":39652,"topicId":39636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-His current obsession is fire burning, so he s getting on with it, burning lots of different things in the back garden in the past 2 months or so.-=- Has he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726890839\">-=-His current obsession is fire burning, so he&#39;s getting<br/>\non with it, burning lots of different things in the back garden in the<br/>\npast 2 months or so.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHas he put designs on wood?

We just see it <br/>\nas he is a totally different type of human being, just on a different <br/>\nfrequency compare to ours. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was evidence when we recently had to filled up a form for him. <br/>\nAlot of his behaviour was classified as a disability, which to us, was <br/>\nboth amazingly funny and surprising. Because we never did see it that <br/>\nway. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that he is now socialising well with another asperger child, <br/>\ntells me that they can communicate well, as long as they are on the <br/>\nsame wave lenght.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI am unschooling an asperger child with atypical traits, meaning he <br/>\ndoes have other so called &quot;limiting&quot; behaviour that&#39;s not noted on the <br/>\ngreat big asperger book. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, limitation is only evident when measured against someone else&#39;s <br/>\nexpectation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do not apply any of your expectation on the child, then the <br/>\nchild&#39;s limitation no longer exist. What you have is the true essence <br/>\nof the child showing, the true beauty and ability of that individual. <br/>\n<br/>\nI unschool my son according to his character and ability. My child <br/>\ndoes not understand limitation because of his narrow obssesion, which <br/>\nis a very common asperger trait. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut yet I have learn to unschool by accepting his obsession, and not <br/>\nlimit it. I just let him get on with it and let it naturally exhaust <br/>\nitself. And this obsession behaviour has led to many great <br/>\ndiscoveries, of his own doing, contributing to great sense of <br/>\nachievements. His current obsession is fire burning, so he&#39;s getting <br/>\non with it, burning lots of different things in the back garden in the <br/>\npast 2 months or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps you need to unschool your expectations of her first? And <br/>\njust accept her for what she is? And focus on her abilities, and work <br/>\ncreatively to bridge that limitations of hers? Just because she cannot <br/>\ncount money, doesn;&#39;t mean her life is gonna be any lesser, is it? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just means she&#39;ll have to handle money in a different method, <br/>\npossibly.

I&#39;ll be looking at those in the days ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add to the situation we are in with our 15 year old, <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m not sure but what we may be talking at cross purposes.<br/>\nI mentioned her IQ, not because I put faith in this score, but <br/>\nbecause it is one part of the effort we&#39;ve been making to figure out <br/>\nwhat is going on.   I have no clue what my other seven children&#39;s IQ <br/>\nscores are, or mine, or my husband&#39;s.    It would never, never occur <br/>\nto me to even consider testing one of the other children.    But <br/>\nthis child is struggling in ways I&#39;ve never encountered.   We have <br/>\nno medical history of her before we adopted her when she was six.   <br/>\nWe have no information as to what she might have been exposed to in <br/>\nutero.   We do know, however, that something is clearly limiting her <br/>\nabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra asked if she has access to using money.   Of course.   She <br/>\ngets an allowance and is expected to pay for certain expenses, such <br/>\nas going to movies, buying gifts for friends, buying snacks and much <br/>\nmore. We play board games routinely.    She helps me in the kitchen <br/>\nwith preparing meals that involve the use of recipes in cookbooks.  <br/>\nShe has a digital watch, digital alarm clock, calendars, appointment <br/>\nbooks.    There are areas in which she hasn&#39;t been able to make <br/>\nconnections that I would think would be fairly normal for a fifteen <br/>\nyear old.    <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, she can&#39;t count the money in her wallet.   She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow if she has enough money to make a purchase.   If she has two <br/>\ntens, three fives, and seven ones, plus change, she won&#39;t know if <br/>\nshe can buy something that costs $12 because there is no $12 <br/>\nbill.    When counting coins, if she has three quarters and three <br/>\ndimes, she can&#39;t figure out how much that is.   I have tried to help <br/>\nher make these connections in as many ways as I know.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShe cannot keep days of the week straight from months of the year.   <br/>\nShe can&#39;t name all the months and she doesn&#39;t know what month <br/>\nChristmas occurs in.    She can&#39;t get the connection as to what <br/>\nmonth comes after December.   We use calendars all the time, trying <br/>\nto present ideas that much younger children are typically absorbing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently she was helping as an usher at a ballet performance for an <br/>\nout-of-town touring company.   She couldn&#39;t direct people to their <br/>\nseats because she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet well enough to recognize <br/>\nwhere the different letters will fall in the rows at the theatre.   <br/>\nShe literally was taking people to the front of the auditorium, then <br/>\nadvancing up the stairs until she got to the correct row.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen helping me cook, she can&#39;t differentiate between the different <br/>\nsized measuring cups.    If asked to add two-thirds cups of sugar to <br/>\na recipe, she will be frustrated because there is no two thirds cup <br/>\nin our collection.   She doesn&#39;t understand that you could fill the <br/>\none-third cup twice.     This is after cooking with me daily for <br/>\nyears.    She can&#39;t figure fractions using pies or pizzas.   She has <br/>\nnot been able to prepare meals for herself that require mixing <br/>\ningredients that need any degree of measuring.    She was mixing a <br/>\nbox of brownie mix the other day that called for two tablespoons of <br/>\noil, and she didn&#39;t know how much that was.   I handed her the set <br/>\nof measuring spoons, and that was no help because there isn&#39;t one <br/>\nspecifically labeled two tablespoons.    We&#39;ve been mixing these <br/>\nbrownies for years.  Virtually every two weeks I&#39;ll explain that we <br/>\nfill the tablespoon two times.   She cannot figure out how to double <br/>\na recipe, even though she will be at my side while I do this and I <br/>\ntalk through the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are six of us at the table routinely, but our older kids join <br/>\nus fairly often.    If I tell her that her older brother and his <br/>\nwife will be coming and ask her to set extra places, she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how many places to set.   But she can add six and two.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me add, I&#39;m not making any of these activities &quot;educational.&quot;  <br/>\nBoard and card games are routine around here.   But she needs our <br/>\nhelp to participate, just as we would have helped one of the kids <br/>\nwhen they were five or six year olds, just learning a game. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t understand the concepts of before and after.   Recently <br/>\nher ballet teacher asked her to come an hour early for a costume <br/>\nfitting, and she didn&#39;t have a clue as to what time that would be.   <br/>\nIf a movie starts at six and lasts two hours, she won&#39;t know when it <br/>\nis over.   She can read a digital clock, but she can&#39;t connect how <br/>\nmany minutes it will be until something starts.    If we plan to <br/>\nleave the house at 3:15, and it&#39;s 2:45, she won&#39;t know how lont it <br/>\nis until we leave.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShe can&#39;t read a thermometer.  She can&#39;t use a calendar to see how <br/>\nmany days it will be until an event.    She doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>\nfigure the number of days when going from, oh, let&#39;s say the 25&#39;th <br/>\nof one month to the 3rd of the next, even with a calendar in front <br/>\nof her.    Recently she asked when her next hair appointment was, <br/>\nand I said that I had written it on the calendar, and she had no <br/>\nidea that if it wasn&#39;t on the current page that it might be on the <br/>\nnext.   She didn&#39;t see an appointment written in October, and she <br/>\nhad no concept of looking at November.   We&#39;re going to Florida in <br/>\nJanuary and she doesn&#39;t know if that is before or after Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seeks out age appropriate books, but she has never been able to <br/>\ntalk about the content.   She can&#39;t participate in real <br/>\nconversations with people, so she does lots of diversional tactics <br/>\nlike saying things that she knows are silly. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves computer games that are totally visual, but can&#39;t move <br/>\nbeyond to any that require strategic thinking.    And she can&#39;t play <br/>\nbasic board games that require any strategy.  She likes movies and <br/>\ntv but can&#39;t participate in any family discussion on what is going <br/>\non.    We will make predictions as to what we think might happen in <br/>\nan ongoing series, and she clearly doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer speech and language issues are similar to those you would expect <br/>\nwith an adult who had suffered a stroke.    Every professional she <br/>\nhas encountered believe she has suffered some type of brain injury, <br/>\neither before or after birth.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I&#39;m raising all this is that I&#39;m not sure about what <br/>\nparents of children with severe developmental disabilities do with <br/>\nrespect to unschooling.   While I have confidence that the other <br/>\ngirls learn a great deal from normal family activities, I&#39;m not <br/>\nconfident that this particular chid is able to function at that <br/>\nlevel.    So, my question is, would you recommend unschooling for a <br/>\nchild who has a significant developmental disability?    Anyone who <br/>\nspends time with my daughter knows that there is a major problem, <br/>\nbut we don&#39;t have a diagnosis.     We know that she will likely <br/>\nnever be able to live independently, although our hope is that she <br/>\nwill be able to have a job outside a &quot;sheltered work environment.&quot;  <br/>\nWe have been advised to provide a financial plan with guardians for <br/>\nher inheritance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any confidence that anything I&#39;ve done so far has <br/>\nhelped much.   I moved away from anything approaching formal work <br/>\nwith her a long time ago, because it was so frustrating for her.  I <br/>\ntry to keep things as low key, non-threatening as possible because I <br/>\nwant to keep pressure off out of concern for her self image, which <br/>\nhas already been damaged pretty badly because of the abuse she faced <br/>\nin the orphanage.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI probably am coming off as defensive, and I probably am, because <br/>\npeople keep telling me what works with their kids who have ADD or <br/>\ndyslexia or are autistic, and none of these apply to a child who <br/>\npossibly has brain damage and a signifant developmental disability.  <br/>\nA friend whose child has Downs told me it&#39;s actually easier in some <br/>\nways for her because her child&#39;s disability is visual.   Our <br/>\ndaughter has something going on in her brain that is very real, but <br/>\nwe can&#39;t diagnose it or find a particular therapy to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nElaine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39951,"nextTopicId":39908}}
