And I was rolling in the aisles and speaking in tongues<br/>\nwhen I was done as it was just a magnificient take on living (perhaps<br/>\nliving in America), full of humor and irony.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Self Improvement speaks volumes of a lot of things: relationships<br/>\natleast the pathetic aspect of them, the whole self improvement creed,<br/>\nhidden talents and the need for zany poetry to illumine all of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun this!<br/>\n<br/>\nSashi<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Details:<br/>\n<br/>\nTONY HOAGLAND&#39;s first book, Sweet Ruin, won the Brittingham Prize in<br/>\nPoetry and the Zacharis Award from Ploughshares at Emerson College. Donkey<br/>\nGospel was the recipient of the 1997 James Laughlin Award of The Academy<br/>\nof American Poets. Hoagland currently teaches at the University of<br/>\nPittsburgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nfor a few more poems from the same book:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.graywolfpress.org/resources/excerpts/excerpts-donkeygospel.html\">http://www.graywolfpress.org/resources/excerpts/excerpts-donkeygospel.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[this poem is archived, accessible and awaiting your comments at]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1236.html\">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1236.html</a><br/>\nTo subscribe, send a blank mail to &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:minstrels-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">minstrels-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13911,"nextTopicId":13913}}
