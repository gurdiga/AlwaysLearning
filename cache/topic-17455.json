My 10yo likes to sweep or rake the yard, clean out the garage, wash floors, fold laundry etc., occasionally.  The 15yo would die of boredom from monotinous things - always has - prefers a personal challenge like digging out shrubs, using power tools or helping Mom with the computer.  He only seems to be less interested in helping out.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s also the dynamic of the &quot;middle child.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 15yo is the firstborn son in an Italian family.  He&#39;s a powerhouse and very expressive with his emotions.  He&#39;s a hot head.  Sometimes it&#39;s so hard for me.  If he weren&#39;t also the tender, kind person that he is, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.  I think he yelled, cussing, from age 13.5 to 15.5.  It seems to be on the wane these days.  I didn&#39;t realize that it was getting quiet around here until he erupted the other day with a thundering round of obsenities from the basement pool table.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re pretty close and he tells me lots of things, but he has a secret life, just like Omri in &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard.&quot;  He wants to work it out on his own.  I want to reassure him, but he dosn&#39;t want it.  He wants to experience the full intensity of his emotions and his power.  Aside from the crudeness, this is what the dog/cat thing means to me.  It was much easier when he was little and wore his heart on his sleeve and wanted reassurance.  That reassured ME.  Now I&#39;m faced with my own experience of teen angst again, with no reassurance from him!<br/>\n <br/>\nLast year we took him parasailing (his choice.)  He was very quiet for weeks afterwards.  I think something primal was satisfied in him.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
