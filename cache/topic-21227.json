I would suggest that your<br/>\nfocus first has to be your own children and dh, then your sister&#39;s kids, and<br/>\nyour sister. Perhaps if dh can look at it from the pov of helping the kids<br/>\nrather than the BIL, that might make it easier for all of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never advise lying to children, but finding ways to tell them bad<br/>\nnews gently, and without exaggeration or focusing on details, unless they<br/>\nask. Maybe along the lines of their uncle has made a mistake, and is taking<br/>\nresponsibility for it and making amends to society. I hope you can suggest<br/>\nto your dh that he refrain from being vocally critical in the kids&#39;<br/>\npresence.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren always know that something is not right. The risk is that they<br/>\nmight sense they are being lied to and come to some erroneous alternative<br/>\nconclusion, like Daddy left because of something they did wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually the truth will come out, it almost always does. The children, who<br/>\nmay even be adults when that happens, will immediately have cause to wonder<br/>\nwhat else they were lied to about. They may be relieved, because finally the<br/>\nmystery of why everyone was so tense and strange during that period has been<br/>\ncleared up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey may feel anger at the experts. When I was 5 I was sent to a boarding<br/>\nschool, while my mother went to Indonesia to work. It was explained that<br/>\ncivil unrest was making this a dangerous place for children (boy did I worry<br/>\nabout Mum!). What I never understood was why my grandparents, who lived<br/>\nnearby, never came to see me, or take me out on the weekends like many other<br/>\nkids. Loneliness. Unloved. I still remember the first time I tied my own<br/>\nshoe lace. It was one of those empty Saturdays, and I was in the playground.<br/>\nI had no-one I could show. In the last 10 years I finally talked to my<br/>\nmother about it. It turns out some &quot;experts&quot; told them it would make it<br/>\nworse for me if they visited. I&#39;m still ready to scream at those asshole<br/>\nexperts, and I&#39;m so sad for that little girl that I was. I&#39;m 43.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your sister is choosing you as a better caregiver than the<br/>\nextended family of her husband. If they as a group advocate lying to<br/>\nchildren, that may be one reason why, even if she has not articulated that<br/>\nto herself. If you tell her that you don&#39;t agree with the lying plan, she<br/>\nmay make an alternative choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
