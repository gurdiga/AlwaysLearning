It was during the Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis happened, the Soviet Union intended to kill us all, we were sure.  President Kennedy, whose family owned sailboats and tennis courts, told us all to exercise more, to be strong to defend the country from communists, and every president in those days pressed us to study math and science, because other countries were &quot;ahead of us&quot; and it was vital for us to be prepared to go to space.<br/>\n<br/>\nSERIOUSLY, it was constant background.  Atomic bombs and space.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the current issue of Smithsonian magazine, there&#39;s a little interview with Al Worden, who has just published a new book called Falling to Earth, about that Apollo 15 mission and the scandal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one of the questions and it&#39;s short but gigantic answer:<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Mianecki, of Smithsonian Magazine:<br/>\nWhat is your reaction to the end of the space shuttle program?<br/>\n<br/>\nAl Worden:<br/>\nIt&#39;s really sad.
