When I was a kid, I knew that it was always best to keep my mouth shut if my siblings did something I didn&#39;t like. If I spoke up, I knew that I would pay one way or another. One of my sisters would tell mom when the rest of us did mean stuff (even if she was part of it). That sister received lots of abuse from the oldest ones. It would have been nice if somebody had spoken up for us so that we didn&#39;t have to worry about silently suffering or getting paid back. Without a vigilant parent that will stand up on the behalf of all of the children, it is no longer safe environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of my younger ones does something to my oldest, my oldest will sometimes say, &quot;That&#39;s okay mom&quot; and I will say, &quot;No it isn&#39;t.&quot; I don&#39;t want any of my children to ever think that abusing another human being is okay. Sometimes I use strong words to convey that message.

I have been pondering and discussing it with the boys (with some success at diverting fights) and there are certain areas that are triggers; situations were the older tries to control the play or activity of the middle, the oldest is not a great sport and won&#39;t be out when he is out and is often in denial of wrong doing (said he did not see the scene of RW flipping someone off in Mrs. Doubtfire).

My 8 year old has been experimenting with swearing since he was 3 at grandmas and said &quot;Sh--&quot; and then<br/>\n&quot;F---&quot;.  (My husband swears, he stopped for a while and so did my son.) I was not sure how to handle that with them or him. He has sworn at park days though to my knowledge stopped when I told him that it is not very appropriate if you are not around others that swear. They will say things like &quot;Hey, Hell is in Hello&quot; and &quot;Oh, are we reading &quot;Little Bitches&quot; again.  I am thinking it would be more useful to be glad they are experimenting with words. My middle son will sometimes shout obcentities at his brother when he gets mad.  I guess the spirit of some swearing gets to me.  It can sound very vulger to my ears.  Also, my oldest flipped off my sister the day after seeing Mrs. Doubtfire, there is a scene where Robin Williams flips someone off who he was mad at.  My sister had been less than nice with him a few minutes before so I understood it.  We discussed that it is not really a nice thing to do even if someone has made you mad.  Wondering how others have talked about swearing (or flipping off) in their house.  I am pretty sure my issue is that I just don&#39;t like it and don&#39;t want it to become part of our daily language as well as the concern of what others will think.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60790,"nextTopicId":60813}}
