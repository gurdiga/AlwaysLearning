She tested into honors English and has done very well. She had been considering going to nursing school and found out she would need a GED to do so.

He has never taken any interest in how the kids were educated and has barely been involved in their lives. His income is considerably higher than mine (10x) and he has so far paid for our daughter&#39;s college classes. She recently asked him to pay for two summer courses. He is refusing to pay for any more college classes until she gets her GED now. He keeps insisting that she won&#39;t be able to get a job (she has one?) without a GED and refuses to discuss it.
