I figured they MIGHT be more &quot;on the <br/>\nball&quot;, but I was mistaken. This is the Bible Belt, and I&#39;m certain they&#39;ve <br/>\nhad a homeschooled student or two apply, if not be accepted.  But the <br/>\nstudents are, for sure, Christianly schooled-at-home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m planning to send each college/university (admissions office) in the state <br/>\nan invitation to attend our Unschooling conference next October. I think they <br/>\nneed some idea of what to expect if an unschooler is interested in attending.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo y&#39;all have any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/6/2001 10:05:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CoxCC@...\">CoxCC@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello!  We base a students acceptance on the GPA from the core courses that <br/>\n&gt; we require and the SAT or ACT score.  We operate on a sliding scale, so <br/>\n&gt; what the GPA needs to be, depends on the SAT or ACT score.  For a point of <br/>\n&gt; reference, if the student has a 2.5 GPA, they need at least an 1100 SAT, if <br/>\n&gt; they have a 3.0, they need at least a 1000 SAT and so on. The 20 core <br/>\n&gt; classes required from high school are listed on our website <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sc.edu/admissions\">http://www.sc.edu/admissions</a> (freshman).  <br/>\n&gt;   A lot of times students who are home schooled take their science labs at <br/>\n&gt; a local college which would meet certification as long as the college is <br/>\n&gt; accredited.  As far as someone not having taken labs at a community <br/>\n&gt; college, receiving any grades, etc., I would need to ask one of our <br/>\n&gt; directors. Please feel free to contact our Admissions Office <br/>\n&gt; (1-800-868-5872, or 777-7700 locally) and let us know about your situation <br/>\n&gt; and we would be glad to find out the answers for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Undergraduate Admissions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kbcdlovejo@...\">Kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; 12/04/01 08:52PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you, but I was asking for more information than that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you REQUIRE SATs? Do you REQUIRE so many years of a language/the <br/>\n&gt; sciences/math/certain histories/etc?  What about portfolios? What about <br/>\n&gt; real <br/>\n&gt; life experiences? What about job experience? What about things that are out <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; of bounds for most schooled students? What about no tests and no grades? <br/>\n&gt; How <br/>\n&gt; do you deal with these kinds of differences? And how do you certify science <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; labs? Schooled and homeschooled and unschooled are very different. Are you <br/>\n&gt; set up to deal with these differences in the application process? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there someone in the admissions office that deals specifically with <br/>\n&gt; applicants that are not traditionally schooled?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/4/2001 3:20:10 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CoxCC@...\">CoxCC@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello!
