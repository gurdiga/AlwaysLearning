There are undoubtedly oodles of things that pass us by that<br/>\nsomeone else would have pointed out to their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the answers that are important. It&#39;s the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said that the reason boys have a big advantage in physics<br/>\n(mechanics) in college is that they&#39;ve had experience with this stuff all<br/>\ntheir lives. *Not* because some has pointed inertia out to them. But just<br/>\nfrom experiencing it. They&#39;ve bounced, hit and kicked balls, rammed toy cars<br/>\ninto each other, jumped off spinning merry go rounds. They&#39;ve *been* the<br/>\nball in the physics book ;-) So when they see the formal explanations they<br/>\nsay &quot;Oh, I know that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a tricky time in physics initially because I had no real images to<br/>\nbuild from, just my false theoretical ideas of how things probably worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the kids need are experiences and awareness to ask questions. And<br/>\nsomeone to help them learn how to find the answers and encourage their<br/>\nquestioning and exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because when my daughter put one hole in a large can of ketchup I<br/>\n&gt; told her she needed to put a second hole in the can to let some air<br/>\n&gt; in.  I did not know what air pressure had to do with any of that<br/>\n&gt; until we poked holes in a 2 liter bottle filled with water and<br/>\n&gt; followed the directions for a science experiment (and the book<br/>\n&gt; explained it).  We both looked at each other and said &quot;the ketchup<br/>\n&gt; can&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s the noticing that&#39;s important. If she hadn&#39;t had a need to put the<br/>\nhole in the ketchup can in a real life situation, then doing the experiment<br/>\nwould have meant very little to her. She wouldn&#39;t have seen how air pressure<br/>\nrelates to real life. It&#39;s likely it would have just been &quot;Oh&quot; and filed<br/>\naway and perhaps forgotten. Were there other experiments you did? Did she<br/>\nhave the same &quot;aha&quot; moments with all of them? Or were they treated like,<br/>\nokay that&#39;s cool, what&#39;s the next one?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as someone said, if your family enjoys experiments, it&#39;s okay to *mess<br/>\naround* with them. Just don&#39;t think of the experiments as the learning and<br/>\neverything else as just living. It&#39;s the experiences that they can then<br/>\nrelate something more formal to (now or in the distant future) that are<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t question why things happen the way they do.  I can learn<br/>\n&gt; about them along with my children and I can begin to ask questions,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe make it your goal to everyday look at something you&#39;ve seen so often<br/>\nyou don&#39;t see it any more and wonder about it. Where did the materials come<br/>\nfrom? How did they get from where they were to where it was made? Why was it<br/>\nmade this way and not some other way? How did people do what the object is<br/>\nfor before this object was invented? What skills used to be involved? What<br/>\nskills are involved in the new one?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat advantage is it for some trees to develop leaves early in the spring?<br/>\nAnd why do some wait until later in the spring? Who used to live on the land<br/>\nbefore you did? (You could go *way* back to Native Americans and prehistoric<br/>\ncreatures or a little back by going to the court house to search through the<br/>\nrecords of who has bought and sold the house over the years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t even worry about the answers at first. Just get in the habit of<br/>\nasking the questions, pondering *possible* answers and developing a sense of<br/>\nwonder.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but what happens to them in the mean time?  Who can show them the<br/>\n&gt; world?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think what you&#39;re really worried about isn&#39;t showing them, it&#39;s explaining<br/>\nthe world to them. Don&#39;t worry about the explanations. Encourage the<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Richard Feynman said that his grandfather told him something to the<br/>\neffect that you could learn all the names of all the birds and still know<br/>\nnothing about the birds. The real learning is in watching one bird, even if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t know it&#39;s name, and *seeing* what it does. How it behaves, how it<br/>\ninteracts with birds and other creatures, how it feeds itself. Someone could<br/>\ndecide to rename all the birds and the name memorizer who had looked so<br/>\nsmart before would know nothing. But the one who had studied the behavior is<br/>\nthe one with the true knowledge of the birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t make a difference if your daughter knows inertia. It&#39;s important<br/>\nthat she experience it. The beauty is you don&#39;t even need to know it exists.<br/>\nYou just need to slow down and experience and say hey, that&#39;s really neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday my daughter was blowing dandelions and, though, of course, jaded<br/>\nas I am I was certain there was nothing for me to learn from something so<br/>\ncommon, she encouraged me to blow and I actually *saw* them for the first<br/>\ntime. How the feathery tufts form a nearly perfect transluscent globe, how<br/>\nthe seeds attach to the middle, how they look like little tiny parachutes.<br/>\nSomeone could probably name all the parts or the physics involved, but that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t important.

Can&#39;t we play?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a homeschool tyrant.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not as bad as I was.  I was so<br/>\nunsure of myself, so thoroughly &quot;schooled,&quot; I couldn&#39;t function in response<br/>\nto my children.  I had Calvert&#39;s Teacher Guide to tell me what to do.  I<br/>\nthought if I did everything on each page, just as I was told, my children<br/>\nwould be educated.  I would be GOOD; I would do what I was told.  What my<br/>\ndaughter experienced was unimportant; she had to do her work.  I actually<br/>\nlocked her in the schoolroom for 2 hours until she finished a worksheet.<br/>\nShe still hates Calvert school based on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been DEschooling myself for 8 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a problem with my totally unschooled son now.  He wants me to teach<br/>\nhim.  I don&#39;t know how.  I don&#39;t have a teacher&#39;s manual, and I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to teach him -- when he was 5, and I tried to explain subtraction, he<br/>\nscrewed up his little face and said &quot;Don&#39;t ever teach me anything again,<br/>\nMommy!  You make it too confusing!&quot;  That was the day I became an unschooler<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  (He&#39;d already taught himself to read.)  He has a schooled friend who<br/>\ncriticizes him for not doing anything all day long, so I think ds wants a<br/>\nmore normal life; he seems to be jealous of the park day kids who &quot;do<br/>\nschool&quot; at home (they&#39;re all in charters, though, and I get to hear their<br/>\nmoms bitch about getting them to do their work!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s OK to structure your day; I wish I had better control of MY time.

There&#39;s sourdough breadmix now that has the sourdough in <br/>\nsome kind of powdered and encapsulated form.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a story of scheduling:<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday night, here, May 6, some people were asleep, the house was quiet, <br/>\nMarty was on crutches for the second day from a play-wrestling injury on <br/>\nSaturday.  10:35, Holly had watched the Simpsons and came and said &quot;I want to <br/>\ngo to bed.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe often stays up later. Sometimes I do too, but I said, &quot;Me too, I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went out front to put a rented DVD in the mailbox, so we can get a <br/>\nTwilight Zone episode we have in the Netflix cue that we&#39;re wanting to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty boring so far, and very routine, and moments from me reading her to <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\nI&#39;m at the mailbox, she&#39;s swinging from a rope in the tree, and we hear huge <br/>\nscreech of tires, and look over toward the main road.  We have only about a <br/>\n10 degree view of Juan Tabo from our front yard (through our sideyard and <br/>\nover the back wall--we were at the top of the highest point of our property), <br/>\nbut right there was the wreck, and we saw it.   Holly wanted to go closer, so <br/>\nwe passed through the house, I dialed 911 and handed the phone to Marty and <br/>\nsaid to tell them there was just a wreck at Juan Tabo and Lexington, and <br/>\nHolly and I walked through the house, out the backgate, across a field and <br/>\nsat on the bus bench by Hollywood Video, while the drivers exchanged <br/>\ninformation and the passengers in the cars negotiated who was how, who should <br/>\nsit and be where, and, in one case, what they were going to tell the police.  <br/>\n(We didn&#39;t hear details, just heard &quot;Just don&#39;t mention that.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were three cars, all driven by males in at least their 20&#39;s, all with <br/>\npassengers, one with several passengers, and one from just a couple of blocks <br/>\naway, because people were walking back and forth from the house, and others <br/>\nfrom their house came out.  There were no injuries involving blood or breaks, <br/>\njust fright and getting jerked around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally heard sirens from both directions, but the four police cars which <br/>\narrived all came from the south.  And they pulled up strategically, and then <br/>\nthree left.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was another wreck at Comanche and Juan Tabo, barely over half a mile <br/>\naway.  We could see the lights there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur conversation involved what the people needed to have and know who were in <br/>\nthe accident (licenses, insurance cards), and what the police are looking for <br/>\nand at when they first arrive, and what the duty of the police officers is <br/>\nregarding other traffic, safety of those involved, and other non-obvious <br/>\nmatters.  We discussed the paramedics--same deal.  What is their duty?  Just <br/>\nbecause someone says &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they can say &quot;Okay&quot; and leave <br/>\nwithout at least getting names and vital signs and a little feedback.  Are <br/>\nthe people disoriented?  How are their eyes?  Possible concussion?<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wanted to go and see the other accident, so we went home for the van.  <br/>\nMarty said the 911 dispatcher had been tacky with him and said he had to tell <br/>\nher whether there were injuries and he said he did not know, that he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nat the scene and his mom had told him to call.  She insisted he had to find <br/>\nout.  He didn&#39;t tell her &quot;I&#39;m a kid on crutches and I don&#39;t either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we drove by the other accident.  Two cars, a harder hit, but no blood (for <br/>\nwhich I was relieved).  They had just gotten someone into an ambulance and <br/>\nwere taking them away when we passed by.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe drove back to the other one and parked in the Hollywood video parking lot. <br/>\n No news, no change.  We cruised the other to see if the tow trucks were <br/>\ncoming.  Not yet.  The road, although a main 4 and 6-lane (variously) <br/>\nthoroughfare, was not at all busy at that time of a Monday night.   We were <br/>\ncareful not to be in anyone&#39;s way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to go and watch tow trucks at the site nearest our house and then <br/>\ngo home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an unscheduled hour.  I could have said, &quot;No, Holly, you don&#39;t need to <br/>\nsee that.  I thought you wanted to go to sleep.&quot;   But I took advantage of <br/>\nher interest and an unusual situation to have a long discussion on how <br/>\nliability insurance works, how police gauge by the tire marks and the glass <br/>\non the road how fast cars were probably going, and whose fault it might have <br/>\nbeen.  If the drivers&#39; accounts don&#39;t match they have to go to secondary <br/>\nevidence for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no sense going looking for a wreck, but I saw no sense in letting an <br/>\nopportunity pass by.  I wouldn&#39;t have tried to take a child against his or <br/>\nher will to see something like that.  So it wasn&#39;t my decision, or hers, it <br/>\nwas mutually agreed upon, but I stayed with it as long as there was something <br/>\nnew for her to see and discuss, and as long as she was fascinated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What&#39;s the harm?","postDate":"1020861952","msgId":6732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMi4xMTMyODIwMS4yYTBhNzgwMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6731,"nextInTopic":6733,"prevInTime":6731,"nextInTime":6733,"topicId":6719,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/7/02 7:05:27 PM, homeschoolmd@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-858012263\">In a message dated 5/7/02 7:05:27 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschoolmd@...\">homeschoolmd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Because if my daughter came to me and asked me what a sousaphone was <br/>\nI would look it up in the dictionary and read the definition.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not a bad thing.

I<br/>\nunderstood it much better after doing the fun kid experiment where you put a<br/>\nball in a wagon, pull the wagon and then stop it suddenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you under the impression unschoolers don&#39;t do these kinds of things, or<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t have mountains of books, including texts, workbooks, history<br/>\nbooks, etc.?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because when my daughter put one hole in a large can of ketchup I<br/>\n&gt; told her she needed to put a second hole in the can to let some air<br/>\n&gt; in.  I did not know what air pressure had to do with any of that<br/>\n&gt; until we poked holes in a 2 liter bottle filled with water and<br/>\n&gt; followed the directions for a science experiment (and the book<br/>\n&gt; explained it).  We both looked at each other and said &quot;the ketchup<br/>\n&gt; can&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very cool!  did you know you can blow out a candle by pouring carbon<br/>\ndioxide on it?  I didn&#39;t know that until I had kids and cool books and stuff<br/>\nwe wanted to learn.  I&#39;ve gone through gallons of vinegar and pounds of<br/>\nbaking soda &lt;g&gt;  What&#39;s demonstrated by the experiment is that gases are<br/>\nfluids.  I probably got that right on a test once, but I *learned* it doing<br/>\nthe fun experiment with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t question why things happen the way they do.

Who can show them the<br/>\n&gt; world?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You understand unschooling already: it is living life without school.<br/>\nLiving without waiting for the class to start.  Skipping ahead in the<br/>\ncurriculum if what you want to know is at the end, rather than having to<br/>\nwait for the day its scheduled.  It&#39;s Learning All the Time (and forever, no<br/>\nmatter how old you get).  YOU can show them the world.  And, if what they<br/>\nmost want to learn in the world is something that TOTALLY BORES YOU, you can<br/>\nfind &#39;em a tutor &lt;g&gt;  My kids will never learn to play video games from ME,<br/>\nthat&#39;s for sure -- and they know I&#39;m a hopeless pupil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If you have scheduled educational activities and you know it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; unschooling, and if you believe unschooling is good, why don&#39;t you<br/>\n&gt; unschool?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because I&#39;m &quot;dull&quot; in the unschooling sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nah, you&#39;re not dull.
