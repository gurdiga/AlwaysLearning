A budget doesn&#39;t have to have lots of specific lumps of money in if you don&#39;t want it to; it can be &quot;this is what we need to keep the lights on / food on the table&quot; and &quot;this is the discretionary money&quot; (yes money! I like that label :) ). Or it can be super specific if that works for you. (I like specific categories but I move money around categories a lot - the software I use, You Need A Budget, is great for that and also works with unpredictable income.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt did sound like the original poster didn&#39;t have a good handle on what their family expenses are - essentials, emergency money, debt repayment, fun money - and I think not knowing that can make it hard to clearly say Yes or Not right now. And managing Not right now is (I think) also easier if you&#39;re clear that you can&#39;t do it right now and also clear that you will try to find a way. Getting clear on that doesn&#39;t have to involve &quot;a budget&quot; if that doesn&#39;t work for you but finding a way that does work may be helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think there&#39;s a very real difference between &quot;we can find money for emergency medical care&quot; (or the boiler exploding or whatever) and &quot;we can find money for toys&quot; (adult toys or kid toys!). Small children don&#39;t understand the consequences of not paying the rent or those other boring adult things; those things are real and they are real priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more reasonable comparison might be &quot;if *I* really wanted this could we afford it?&quot; (Or &quot;if I really wanted a similar-price thing which fits my interests&quot;.) But there again, working out what your family *can* sensibly afford is helpful for thinking clearly about that for adults and kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Creating abundance","postDate":"1456170611","msgId":76779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ4MEJERUY4LUVENjMtNDI3RC04RjQ0LUI4QzczOTVGRjVEM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5hZmdvOCsxcmk5aDMyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5hZDA5cStzYnRkcTlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bmFlNzJvKzEycHZhNWxAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bmFmZ284KzFyaTloMzJAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76778,"nextInTopic":76782,"prevInTime":76778,"nextInTime":76780,"topicId":76772,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-There is this idea that budgets are constricting, restrictive, and arbitrary.-=- Because in many cases they are.

Probably in most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-And I used to think so too before I had one.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you have an unschooling budget with a large “yes” category.  That doesn’t redeem the millions of budgets designed to say “no.” <br/>\n<br/>\nI like your story, but remember that yours isn’t representative of the picture of budgets people have in their heads.  I’m glad you described yours, because it will give other people courage to create a budget with leeway in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong ago, three lifetimes ago (Kirby&#39;s, Marty’s and Holly’s, to this point) Keith said he wanted a budget.  I said I didn’t.  He was disturbed.  I explained.  I said if there was a budget amount for clothes, I would feel that I should spend all of it. If there was no such number, we might easily get by on thrift store and hand-me-down stuff some months, or years.    If there was a budget for entertainment, I would feel bad if I wanted to go over.  I might feel robbed if we went under.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of all, I said I thought a budget could become something to fight over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he really wanted was a percentage of income for savings.  So I said to have all the savings he wanted, just not to tell me about it (except for leaving info I could find if something happened to him).  He checked back a couple of times to see if I was serious, or maybe going crazy.  I was seriousl<br/>\n<br/>\nThings worked out well for us.  I didn’t go crazy buying groceries, but sometimes splurged, and usually got what was on sale.  My kids were happy with seconds (a great children’s catalog was in town and they had a store where garments were $1 if there was anything wrong with it (dyed oddly, or seam coming out, or small hole in fabric).  I just got them and mended them.  The kids enjoyed hand-me-downs, usually, but if they spotted something full price, or needed something particular, I felt that our clothing budget was wide open, from having bought nothing new for months or maybe years.<br/>\n<br/>\nToys and games were birthdays, Christmas, or if the game or toy was astounding and we all wanted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouvenirs on road trips were beach towels. :-)  If we couldn’t afford a t-shirt or toy for everyone, we got a towel and a fridge magnet.  Memories shared.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had had the sort of budget Keith was envisioning, I would have kept track of what I had NOT spent and want to cash that out sometimes.  For us, it worked better to have this philosophy:  <br/>\n<br/>\nPay for the house and utilities<br/>\nHave medical insurance<br/>\nKeep at least one car running<br/>\nEat at home nearly always, but for fun sometimes, eat out (entertainment+food, or for kid lunch where they had toys, toy/educational supplies + playground + food)<br/>\n<br/>\nClothes… as described above. Happy fun clothes, and keep them clean and mended.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat wasn’t spent in a given month probably went into Keith’s secret savings, which we’re now using to help our young-adult kids when they need help, and I got a new smart car last week, now that I have no kids to drive around, and we didn’t take a loan for it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI Do drive a kid around, a bit, though.  Kirby’s fiancee’s six-year-old was the first to ride in the car with me, and I take her to school in it each morning, about a mile from here.  She gets to sit in the front because there is no back seat, and that’s the big bonus for her as a kid who’s not yet 60 lbs and so ordinarily would be stuck in a booster chair  in the back seat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it’s hard for many or most younger parents whose kids are still so damp and sticky to imagine retirement with grown children and savings.   Separating a feeling of abundance from spending money, even in small ways, will help with longterm abundance.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though the chat link I left said abundance and finances, we were talking about abundance and gratitude.  Abundance and presence.  Creativity and abundance.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/02/abundance-february-11-2016.html\">http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/02/abundance-february-11-2016.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaking life sparkly and fun doesn’t always cost money.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345817076,"authorName":"Sylvia Woodman","from":"Sylvia Woodman &lt;sylvia057@...&gt;","profile":"sylviawoodman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Creating abundance","postDate":"1456162987","msgId":76778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTUhKS0w5SG91d19iT3FkWjZQc2ppUFRtR19qQWdzTjNGVG0zcjZqbmhRdzkwRWpKd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5hZTcybysxMnB2YTVsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5hZDA5cStzYnRkcTlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8bmFlNzJvKzEycHZhNWxAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76777,"nextInTopic":76779,"prevInTime":76777,"nextInTime":76779,"topicId":76772,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When Harry was that age, he was a bit of a collector.

A wish list on Amazon, or a list in your phone or on the refrigerator or in a notebook with printouts, photos….  Lots of families have had fun with those sorts of things.  And sometimes they might find one in a thrift store (depending what it is).  When Holly was collecting My Little Ponies from ten years before, sometimes a very exciting thrift store find would pop up.  Luckily, in a way, she was collecting them between production phases, so there were no new ones when she was young.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther ideas for younger children, so that he’s not always thinking about a toy, or needing  a toy to make him feel abundance, might be found here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren\">http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/physicality\">http://sandradodd.com/physicality</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMore things in his life that don’t involve toy play could enrich it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a chat on abundance and finances recently and the transcript is here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/02/abundance-february-11-2016.html\">http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/02/abundance-february-11-2016.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357459239,"authorName":"","from":"goyette.christine@...","profile":"german_christine","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Creating abundance","postDate":"1456080053","msgId":76772,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5hZDA5cStzYnRkcTlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76773,"prevInTime":76771,"nextInTime":76773,"topicId":76772,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a question about facilitating abundance. In the past few months my son (4 1/2) has gone from barely interested in toys to happy & appreciative to now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-470752953\">I have a question about facilitating abundance. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past few months my son (4 1/2) has gone from barely interested in toys to happy & appreciative to now expecting and really, really wanting (one could see it as demanding) toys on a daily basis. I could really use some clarity. It seems like I want a rule of some kind. &quot;Make a budget and let him know he can spend $x every day or week.&quot; Or something like that. But that would be arbitrary somehow. We are not poor (not rich either). Money comes in. But it&#39;s unpredictable as my husband is self-employed. This month could be twice as much as last month and next month just half as much etc. And there is a whole bunch of debt too from events 10 years ago. We ourselves don&#39;t have a budget. It&#39;s more like &quot;Eeks, it&#39;s tight right now. Let&#39;s be more cautious&quot; or &quot;Yay! it&#39;s going well. We can afford that.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not even sure how much I am spending on toys every week. Maybe it&#39;s less than it feels like. I&#39;d say my son gets a toy every day on average. So maybe $300 a month?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason it&#39;s become a problem for me is that it&#39;s no longer sweet and happy when he gets toys but there are tears if it&#39;s not the right kind of surprise or if it&#39;s only one toy and not many. For example, one day I brought him home a toy from a show (Blaze) he was really into. Instead of happy he was disappointed because he really wanted the 2 toys from Dinotrux (a show he also likes) that were still missing from the set. So a day later, I was really excited when I spotted both of them at a store!! I bring them home and instead of the shared excitement that he now has the last 2 as well, he cries and says that it&#39;s not a good surprise if it isn&#39;t a Blaze character (the kind I brought him 2 days prior)!! Other days he&#39;s unhappy because it&#39;s only 1 toy. &quot;When I get one you have to bring me 2 or 3 or 4!!!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt used to be fun getting him most of the stuff he wanted or trying to hunt it down used and cheaper. But now it often doesn&#39;t seem enough or not good enough. The other day when I was so excited to have found the last two and it ended up such a miserable experience, it felt like too much and I had thoughts that he was ungrateful and how could he be crying if he is getting something and that other kids would be happy to get a fraction of the toys he&#39;s getting and that this toy buying would take a break for a while because it wasn&#39;t any fun anymore etc. etc. Unfortunately, not all was kept as quiet thoughts in my head. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there is definitely stuff from my past. I grew up with gifts for Christmas and birthday (which happened to be the following day) and maybe one for Easter and some on our summer vacation. But I have changed my thoughts/preferences a lot during the past 2 years. I&#39;d rather have little stuff myself and I am not happy about the cluttering and mess but I am breathing a lot and I am genuinely happy for him. I really want him to feel abundant. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut with this latest development I am not happy. Is it just a phase and normal for a 4 year old? Or did I create this somehow? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should keep buying him as much as possible? With credit cards it&#39;s so hard to say we can&#39;t afford that. Because we could. I would sometimes buy something that probably should wait and then I don&#39;t. Or last weekend we had to call the ambulance and then go to the ER with my son. We have terrible insurance. So we&#39;ve paid about $600 so far (not sure what the total bill will be yet). There is no &quot;we can&#39;t afford that&quot;. Of course, we somehow do. That&#39;s where a lot of my unclarity comes from. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day he wanted to go to the toy store and I said &quot;Ok, I got $10 to spend.&quot; And then I put him into a shopping cart and we went up and down the aisles. At first, he wanted to get the first somewhat interesting toy he saw (like it&#39;s happened before where I wasn&#39;t sure he really was all that interested. And sure enough there were often tears later that he didn&#39;t really want that toy and that he wanted something else now). And so I encouraged him to take it into his cart and look at it closely or play with it some more or really check it out. So lots of going back and fourth and into and out of the cart until he was pretty sure he&#39;d found something he wanted. Then he kept it in his cart for the time it took to get the rest of the groceries/things I needed. I checked with him again and offered to go back to the toy section but he was still happy with his choice. That experience felt really good. I was relaxed because I wasn&#39;t going to spend an amount I wasn&#39;t comfortable with or having to say no and also that he wouldn&#39;t regret the purchase very soon and wanted to go back. At the same time the $10 budget did seem somewhat arbitrary. And I was also thinking having a budget feels less abundant than having no limitations if they weren&#39;t necessary. It&#39;s kind of like if I knew after keeping this rate of purchases up and really rode it out that he would get to a point where he&#39;s filled up and then it goes back to a more affordable level. Like a burst of expenses that really accomplishes the goal of feeling abundance instead of trickling money and never really getting to that feeling of abundance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried thrift stores but it doesn&#39;t seem about just getting something. It needs to be right thing. Which totally makes sense to me. He would pick something there but in his book those purchases wouldn&#39;t really count. He&#39;d still want what he really wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for helping me get some clarity and more happiness for both of us around this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76780,"nextTopicId":76790}}
