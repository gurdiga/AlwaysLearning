That no one could keep that up every day of the year.  Or thats how I read it, or remember it.  I&#39;m not quoting.  So when the warm weather started up, I saw that as a cue to concentrate a little less.  I may have misunderstood what you meant though.  Not much changed in reality, except less planning on my part of activities at home.  More time at fun library events, outdoors, parks, splash pads, biking, etc have filled some of that in.

Compulsory school age is grade 1 here, I think.  I&#39;ve had two years on this list, reading and writing, learning and practicing.  I think its been great, I&#39;ve learned so much, and this list has definitely helped to guide us from attachment parenting to something more (unschooling as a form of parenting).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis past &#39;school-year,&#39; I began what I thought of as our experiemental unschooling year (unschooling as something more than just parenting practices, although its hard to really tell any difference in reality).  We had a nice year, laid back, lots of outings to friends, homeschool group, library.  We got a TV set up a few months back, with some shows the two kids like (younger is 2.5 years old).  I was thinking up and bringing out projects to explore, artsy, baking, experiments, games, etc... strewing.  Not as much as I thought I should, but enough that I felt I was doing well.  At the end of May, as it warmed up and we moved more in the park/playground/swimming groove, I said to myself - &quot;This year was a success, I consider the &#39;school&#39; year over now, so lets all relax more.&quot;  What I meant was not that we should stop learning... but that I decided that I wouldn&#39;t put as much effort into planning activites, arts, experiments, etc at home.  We still go to most of our weekly outings (library, park, homeschool group, etc).  Biking, swimming, errands, etc.  I&#39;m just not looking for art projects and volcanos to build and such so actively.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts been two months of that.  Some things have changed which may be spurring me to doubt my suitability for homeschooling.  Sibling rivalry has taken on a new flavor - with our 2.5 year old son actively engaging in it now.  I was expecting that, I suppose, but its still a difficult transition.  Instead of my usual level of attention to their interactions, which I&#39;ve become used to, I have to either pay much closer attention, or mediate difficult situations that I didn&#39;t catch developing.  Along with that, they have been spending more time watching TV, which doesn&#39;t bother me, except that it makes me think that I haven&#39;t been strewing their home lives with more options and they are just watching because they have nothing else to do.  They don&#39;t generally play unless I get down and initiate it with some toys - I&#39;m not sure why.  Sometimes they do play spontaneously, alone or together - which is beautiful to watch and participate in.   But, aside from all the days we go out for fun, the majority of their time at home is watching TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started wondering if I would prefer to have kids in school (5 yo this or next year, other kids around that age too), the benefit being that the school fills their lives with lots to do each day.  Yes, I know I don&#39;t agree with all they would do, or think is valuable to individual students, etc... but it would still be the benefit to me of not having to think up new and exciting activities to do every day (which sometimes is easy, but sometimes isn&#39;t).  I&#39;ve started psyching myself out about all the years ahead of us.  Will they change?  Will they play more?  Explore art materials without direct participate by me?  Sit and look at pictures in books, or read when they are ready, without me turning the pages?  I guess obviously they will, when they are ready.  Feels like they won&#39;t though.   And when I worry about those things, and then think about career ideas that I dream about, school sounds appealing!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with those things, our 5 year old daughter has also become somewhat more difficult to be around - maybe its a stage of development.  She seems to disagree, or not listen to us when something is very important, about her safety or her brothers.  Sometimes there isn&#39;t time to hear her out in certain situations - and she has some speech difficulties which slow her down.  Its fustrating for her and us.  She gets into our personal space, or acts very rudely, like saying &quot;Get away from here&quot; with a very rude tone and facial expression to her father.  That makes him want to stay where he is and demand polite behaviour, to which she flies into a rage, hitting him, throwing/messing things, and eventually running to her room and crying under her blanket angrily.  I&#39;ve worked with her on ways to calm herself (Sandra&#39;s breathing techniques, plus lots of other ideas) when all is calm, but she won&#39;t use them when she is upset.  When its her brother that causes her to become violent/engraged, I&#39;ve found it easiest to just pick her up and plop her on her bed, and go and visit to her and go through her feelings with her without talking about what she did wrong to her brother.  She calms down faster if she can get through the rage, into her crying under blanket stage, faster.  But I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the source of this: I&#39;ve explored hunger, fatigue, boredom, etc.  The only thing I think it could be is just that her brother has changed and is &#39;fighting back&#39; when she tries to control him or their play, and she hasn&#39;t adapted to that yet.  These issues could also be what is spurring me to think about school - almost like school would be a breath of fresh air.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do parents know if they are not the right type to homeschool after all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually try to keep my posts short and concise, but this turned into an essay.
