What he learned in a couple of remedial math classes, each twice a week for one semester, was more solid and sensible than thirteen years of school math, AND Marty has no math aversion or disgust. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Holly were talking the other day.  She was enrolled in a reading class for learning to analyze writing, and being a critical thinker.  He had taken that, and also English 101, and was recommending Holly do the first English class instead.  He said the first part of the class was a review of grammar and mechanics, and they talked about what verbs where.  He kind of rolled his eyes, thinking that would be too easy for Holly, too, but she said, &quot;Oh, that sounds fun!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning something for fun when one is older is easier, quicker and (yeah, for sure) More FUN!  She knows most of that already, just from being around and being curious and open to learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n[I&#39;m going on a bit about school below because it can be interesting to see how always unschooled people deal with their early exposure to formal classes.]<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s going to drop the reading class because the teacher has a ton of arbitrary rules, and the directions aren&#39;t clear or sensible.  I read the first assignment and &#39;bout flew out of my chair from the typos and really bad writing, but managed to only sort of express my disgust.  I reined it in. :-)  Holly was in by one point (on the placement test), and the teacher said on the first day that anyone who was close should drop out and re test.  Holly said at first that it would have made more sense for the English 101 teacher to say that anyone who was only a few points from NOT testing in might want to take the easier class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that sweet?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is thinking about the ease for the students and the courtesy teachers should have.   She has NO IDEA that there is a long history of teachers purposely making things harsh and difficult and antagonistic.  She doesn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s all about getting college credits, and not about learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe retested, got a much higher score (it being the second time she had ever taken such a test, rather than the first time), and isn&#39;t going to take either of those classes, but just stick with the math for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she went in to take the test the second time, she asked me for advice.  I said read things carefully, maybe twice, and if it&#39;s confusing, try reading it from the end back.  And double-check the answers, because the question might have been tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe came back, said that had helped, but she said &quot;I got really bored a couple of times.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI took lots of standardized tests in school.  I took regular in-class tests.  I took end-of-week, end-of-unit, mid-term, semester, final tests beyond number.  ACT.  SAT.  GRE.   I know they&#39;re boring, especially the times when they would say listen to the instructions with your pencil down.  Make no marks until the proctor tells you.  And we would take ten minutes just to fill in our names and mark our school, because the proctors had to check everything.  And tests in class were boring, when I knew all the answers and still had to go through the motions and then sit quietly until everyone else was finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlash forward to 2012, when the tests are on computers and the kids don&#39;t have to wait for the proctor or get permission to sharpen a pencil.
