Pure and complete","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1621346126\">Relativism taken to the extreme does indeed mean all choices are <br/>\nvalid.  It depends on what level the person sets as the relative <br/>\nmeasure.  Pure and complete relativism means a choice is only good or <br/>\nbad in respect to each individual person.  Others set the relative <br/>\nmeasure higher at nationality, ethnicity, religion, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubjectivism is the theory that there is no set in stone absolute <br/>\nright/wrong choice, but that some choices are so overwhelmingly seen <br/>\nas good or bad that they must for all practical purposes be <br/>\nconsidered good or bad.  Your example of nakedness is a good <br/>\nillustration of subjective morality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, honor killings (ie, killing of raped girls by their <br/>\nfamily for the insult of bringing shame on the family) in the middle <br/>\neast would be seen as bad by a moral subjectivist, but seen as an OK <br/>\nchoice for a moral relativist who sets the measure at religion or <br/>\nethnicity, or lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two concepts are confused often and in the case of dishonest <br/>\npeople arguing for religion, are often confused on purpose.  It is <br/>\nsemantics, but can be very important to many discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-John Rizzo<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-It is where relativism<br/>\n&gt; fails us (i.e. all choices are valid). -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t think &quot;relativism&quot; means all choices are valid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The idea that there is no one single right or moral way to be <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; mean that ALL things are equally moral or valid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just because there&#39;s no one truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such <br/>\nthing  <br/>\n&gt; as bullshit.
