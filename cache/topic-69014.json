Both [boys, one is around 7 and one is<br/>\naround 13] liked a piece of quartz that was around $4. .------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was your first mistake. A gem and mineral store is full of bright, colorful sparkly objects. For a lot of kids, a store like this is as rich with desire as a candy store, maybe even more so. It honestly seems cruel to plan a trip to such a place with young children and NOT plan on buying something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t have to be something expensive. Like Marina suggested, you could have agreed that each boy had $3 to spend beforehand. $6 is far less than defending a child in juvenile court and far less still than dealing with addictions or therapy or any other host of issues that are more likely to arise from children who grow up feeling unheard amidst a sense of lack.<br/>\n<br/>\n---I didn&#39;t buy it because we had tons of similar rocks at home----<br/>\n<br/>\nStrike two.  In order to successfully unschool it is imperative that you accept that your children, their interests, desires, tastes, priorities, etc are not and will not (always, or even often) be the same as yours.<br/>\n<br/>\n*You* are quite content with the rock collection you already have, that doesn&#39;t mean your children are too. How many shirts do you own? Surely you have more than enough shirts already. I&#39;m guessing you have a few that are even the same color or made from the same kind of cloth. If, at a thrift store, you found a 50 cent shirt similar in some ways to one you already own and your husband said, &quot;Pfff. You can&#39;t get that; you have enough shirts already,&quot; how would you feel/react? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, pretend that the shirt seemed really special. It had just the kind of embroidery around the neckline that you love because it reminds you of something your kind grandmother wore. It is a special shirt to you for very individual reasons, but you&#39;re still not allowed to buy it. There are two injuries here: 1) that something you found special wasn&#39;t validated by someone who loves you and 2) the reason wasn&#39;t even a real reason. If you could afford the gas to go to the store, I&#39;m guessing 50 cents wasn&#39;t going to set you over the edge into financial ruin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are collectors. When my daughter was younger, she often wanted to buy things that were just like, or very similar to things she already had. For her, that was part of the appeal: to have three of the exact same animal figures (one for me, one for her dad and one for her). She actually has a collection of polished blue stones, the kind you get at a gem store and fill a bulk bag with. More than once, she&#39;s filled the bag with all blue stones, which have become diamonds, pretend food, hardened lava piles, etc for all kinds of various games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is extremely disrespectful to tell someone else what may or may not hold meaning for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not my place to decide when my daughter is full.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----When we got back... I saw a pretty rock and I realized [the older boy] stole it.<br/>\nIt was a 50¢ item. I asked and he confessed that he &quot;took&quot; it.-------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you believe there&#39;s a problem with his using the word &quot;took&quot; instead of &quot;stole.&quot; I wonder if you hammered that point home to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you aware that in some places, an item has to be worth a certain amount of money before it is considered shoplifting? I believe that in nearly every state, taking an item worth less than a few hundred dollars is actually a misdemeanor, not a full-blown felony.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be, depending on the articles you read to him, that you were lying too. Trying to use fear to control his behavior. Behavior that you could have avoided in the first place if you were more attentive and proactive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----I don&#39;t know how to deal with it. [Will kids usually] stop after being caught?----<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it depends. It depends what motivates them to steal in the first place.  Someone who is experiencing lack might well continue to try to fill the void however possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----He has been very evasive when confronted in the past.
