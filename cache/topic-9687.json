When Rain was really small, she *needed* to be upright<br/>\nand looking out. I could sit her in the sling with her back against my<br/>\nchest and her legs folded, and she was happy that way. Then there was a<br/>\nperiod when she didn&#39;t like the sling at all. When she got older, like<br/>\n6-9 months, she liked the hip carry in the sling. After a while, we<br/>\nmodified it to a back-of-the-hip carry, and I carried her that way until<br/>\nshe was over 3 and close to 40 pounds - it was great for when she wanted<br/>\nto be close and I was trying to cook or shop or something (and I&#39;m a<br/>\npretty skinny person, I was carrying about a third of my body weight at<br/>\nthe end and it wasn&#39;t too heavy).<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 2?&#39;s OT","postDate":"1033497470","msgId":9717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEOTlFQjdFLjkwMDAyMDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1Yi4xNTBmMmYyMy4yYWNhMmFiOEBhb2wuY29tPiA8M0Q5OEQ1RDYuMjA0MDAwOUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDA3ODAxYzI2OTZhJDA1ODc1NDAwJDAyMDAwMDAzQGFzLnV0ZXhhcy5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":9716,"nextInTopic":9719,"prevInTime":9716,"nextInTime":9718,"topicId":9687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yeah, it s really nice.  you can have them how you want them, with a pillow or not, etc.  i don t want to advertise (unlike yahoo, looking at their ad below my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2081858018\">yeah, it&#39;s really nice.  you can have them how you want them, with a <br/>\npillow or not, etc.  i don&#39;t want to advertise (unlike yahoo, looking at <br/>\ntheir ad below my wrting now) but i got my mom to start making slings <br/>\nbecause i wanted one made my way.  ;-)  people can even pick out their <br/>\nown fabric.  <br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Millard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; awesome!
