Shedding<br/>\nmore light on my own thinking about these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must be some sort of philosophical omnivore.  I love to incorporate<br/>\nanything that feeds my unschooling journey, that I find useful.  I have<br/>\ngleaned from Scott&#39;s excellent wording of the parenting situation many<br/>\ntimes.  And more times than I can count, I&#39;ve done the same on unschooling<br/>\nlists for about 4 years now, maybe longer.  Yet I&#39;m not loyal to either<br/>\none.  This is my life and I can choose to ditch one or both or to keep<br/>\nboth.  We all decide what we think about correctness as we go along.  No one<br/>\nhas to say anything about it.  It happens on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point in this post is that I appreciate the philosophical diversity.<br/>\nIt&#39;s like the chicken and egg .... which came first?  You can trace a good<br/>\nbit back to any number of other philosophies and philosophers.  Many<br/>\nunschooling lists refer to John Holt.  And John Holt is not a sudden<br/>\ndevelopment that came sprang nowhere himself.  The roots go far back and<br/>\nlong ago, getting more and more lost to antiquity every year.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that the ecology of it is important.  Philosophies come and go,<br/>\nand find their uses where they are relevant to the surrounding culture.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsure John Holt is one of the major culmination points in the ecology of<br/>\neducational philosophies.  Instead of seeing ourselves in a mirror and<br/>\nwalking away forgetful of what we&#39;ve seen (like schoolthink does, which<br/>\ncan&#39;t draw much from unschooling), parents can directly experience what Holt<br/>\nalluded to by unschooling their children.  A fantastic privilege and<br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt&#39;s work *supports* a variety of similar thoughts as well as diverging<br/>\nones.  Other&#39;s ideation sometimes is *supported* and other times pulled from<br/>\nthe roots to plant something else as a result of coming into contact with<br/>\nthe varied thoughts and ideas from Holt&#39;s &quot;pollenation,&quot; philosophical<br/>\nspeaking.  This construction and destruction is a natural process of the<br/>\nthought life in various &quot;ecologies&quot; to form the philosophical structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany converging and diverging philosophies build and pull down parts in my<br/>\nown thinking.  When I agree, great.. it builds something for me.  When I<br/>\ndisagree, great .... at some point, the disagreement comes back around full<br/>\ncircle to eventual agreement (partially or in full) or it creates more (or<br/>\nduplicates) clarity on the thinking I already had.  Either way, I am<br/>\ndeciding what&#39;s relevant to me, and passing some on for consideration by<br/>\nothers in my family and among my friends.  We are choosing our support<br/>\nsystems as we go, and in the same process, we are our own greatest supporter<br/>\nof our own personal growth.  Even when we don&#39;t know it, and even when it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t benefit us the way we&#39;d like it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found in unschooling lists possibly the greatest benefactor of the<br/>\nhappiness I&#39;m building in the life of my family.  On the lists, I can potter<br/>\nthrough scads of ideas the way I can&#39;t in real life.  It&#39;s like a lab in a<br/>\ncourse for personal growth tailor-made for me, in which I get to form up the<br/>\nhypotheses and test on my own and I don&#39;t have to report anything to<br/>\nanybody.  It&#39;s just for me.

I did talk to Sandra about it and also as much as I could  <br/>\nremember about the lengthy and constructive talk Scott and I had,  <br/>\nlater, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I understood from Scott was that he&#39;d read archives of an  <br/>\nunspecified unschooling list(s) and felt that people were being  <br/>\npressured to unschool correctly and follow certain rules of  <br/>\nunschooling. He felt that people were being told things like &quot;you&#39;re  <br/>\ndoing it wrong&quot; and &quot;here is how to do it right&quot; and &quot;it is only right  <br/>\nif you do it my way.&quot; He was warning them off of that kind of right  <br/>\nand wrong thinking and warning them not to jump from the &quot;box&quot; of  <br/>\nschool thinking to another &quot;box&quot; of unschooling correctness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an aspect of this point that I completely agree with. People  <br/>\noften come to the unschooling lists and want our approval; they want  <br/>\nto know if they are &quot;doing it right.&quot; I am with Scott 100 percent in  <br/>\nencouraging those people to STOP seeking approval, stop trying to fit  <br/>\nin, don&#39;t make their own journey about following someone else&#39;s rules  <br/>\nor principles. Instead, make it all about gaining deeper understanding  <br/>\nof what is best for your own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far so good, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was unhappy about was not the above message.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I objected to was people being warned away from the unschooling  <br/>\nlists where I believe they have the best chance of truly doing that  <br/>\nsometimes very hard work of letting go of their own &quot;shoulds&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;musts&quot; and &quot;have to&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe example Scott gave in his talk was that if you go to these lists  <br/>\nand mention limiting screen time that you&#39;ll get flamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT is what I referred to as badmouthing the lists. Flaming is NOT a  <br/>\nnice thing to be accused of at all. People who are &quot;flaming&quot; are being  <br/>\nhostile and insulting, not constructive or clarifying, and an  <br/>\naccusation of &quot;flaming&quot; is badmouthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens on the unschooling lists is nothing like flaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens on these lists is that people&#39;s ideas and beliefs are  <br/>\nmost definitely challenged. That is the very purpose OF the lists. To  <br/>\ncharacterize that as &quot;flaming&quot; is a very strong and very negative  <br/>\njudgment and I was quite upset by it (I was in the audience).<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that evening I expressed my objections to Scott (and I want to  <br/>\nsay clearly that Scott listened carefully and I felt like we  <br/>\ncommunicated well). We talked for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt that Scott, like others, did not understand the nature and  <br/>\npurpose of the lists. While I believe he is correct that there are  <br/>\npeople who DO want to jump out of the schooling box and into another  <br/>\none, I don&#39;t think it is the lists that are to blame for that or that  <br/>\nthe lists pressure people into that. It is the people coming to the  <br/>\nlists already WANTING and seeking membership in the &quot;unschooling club&quot;  <br/>\nwho end up hurt and upset because what happens on these lists is that,  <br/>\ninstead of feeling welcomed into that new unschooling box, their ideas  <br/>\nare challenged and critiqued.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo people experience discomfort at having their ideas held up to a  <br/>\nbright light and carefully and critically scrutinized? Some people  <br/>\nfind it painful and others find it exhilarating. It definitely isn&#39;t  <br/>\neveryone&#39;s cup of tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott had said in his talk that they limit &quot;screen time.&quot; I told Scott  <br/>\nthat I think it is insulting to the kids to use the term &#39;screen time&#39;  <br/>\nand lump together all the different things they might do that involve  <br/>\ntv, video games, or computers. He disagreed and said he thought screen  <br/>\ntime was something those activities all had in common. I didn&#39;t argue.  <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t argue. I didn&#39;t get the feeling he thought he&#39;d just been  <br/>\n&quot;flamed&quot; - I got the feeling that he absolutely knew that I&#39;d just  <br/>\noffered him something, based on my own understanding and experience,  <br/>\nthat I thought might be useful for him to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t make any difference in my family if Scott&#39;s family limits  <br/>\nwhat he calls screen time. We will continue to sit in our living room,  <br/>\nall together, with our laptops, while we watch Project Runway or the  <br/>\nVice Presidential debates or a British soccer game or all KINDS of  <br/>\nother shows, and we&#39;ll pause the DVR so we can talk and look things up  <br/>\non google and laugh and learn together. I have NOTHING to gain by  <br/>\nconvincing Scott to think my way about tv, video games, or computer  <br/>\nuse. His kids are still young and I know he&#39;s still interested and  <br/>\nopen-minded and willing to listen to alternative ideas, so I offered  <br/>\nhim that one. A freebie &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is very typical of the kind of interaction that gets taken by  <br/>\nsome people as us trying to impose &quot;unschooling correctness,&quot; as Scott  <br/>\ncalled it. I don&#39;t think Scott took it that way, and I think/hope that  <br/>\nhe came to understand that this was a problem that people were  <br/>\nbringing with them to the lists, not having it imposed on them there.  <br/>\nBecause HE wasn&#39;t worried, himself, about fitting into someone else&#39;s  <br/>\ndefinition of unschoolling, I think he took my comments exactly as  <br/>\nintended.

I found the talk, in general, to be more &quot;un&quot; than anything, and not helpful, in my mind, in moving toward actual unschooling.  The part I heard was fairly negative and critical in the broadest sense--not promoting anything positive, just dissing the &quot;dogma&quot; of unschooling, which is why his comments about lists and yahoo groups packed a little more punch when taken in the whole context.  There was no understanding or acknowledgement expressed that, like trying to learn any new system, you have to adopt a certain amount of dogma to &quot;try it on&quot; and find what fits, and figure out what people are talking about.  Most people move past that stage and become more creative with it as they internalize it, but it is a valid stage of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found lacking were what I have considered to be some key components that this list has helped me to develop, like TRUST.

It doesn&#39;t mean that they were, but I was concerned with it.  Now that I have found how to have a true connection with my children that is not based on a power differential, I am much more concerned with that relationship.  The questions about &quot;how to do it right&quot; have melted away.  But it took time and searching to find that place, and if someone hasn&#39;t truly found that place, yet is attempting to speak to audiences and advise people for money, then they may feel like they have a lot to be defensive about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211613982,"authorName":"Margaret","from":"Margaret &lt;margaretz@...&gt;","profile":"margaretzat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Scott Noelle (was: dd likes to be at home w/ family most of the time","postDate":"1223139370","msgId":39100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDgxMDA0MDk1Nng3NDY3ZDNhMGc5ZWFjNWFhZDVmOTU1ZjVjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjN3R0ZitsZjhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJDRUI3RUY0LTEyQkMtNDQ1OC05NEUxLTU1MjQxMTc5Q0FDMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxnYzd0dGYrbGY4aUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39098,"nextInTopic":39101,"prevInTime":39099,"nextInTime":39101,"topicId":38986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I listened to it.

She rides horses, too, and interacts well with other people there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently, she has sought social experiences or said yes to some  <br/>\nsuggestions of mine. But, at 13, things can still go off the rails for  <br/>\nher quickly in a social circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says she wants to be in the situation, looks forward to it, has  <br/>\nplans of how to handle things if it&#39;s difficult, but has expectations  <br/>\nof how things will go, even if I try to prepare her for possibilities.  <br/>\nWhen her expectations are not realized, or she&#39;s not prepared for some  <br/>\nkind of interaction, she can get pretty agitated. And it can happen in  <br/>\na flash.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can catch the moment just before the tipping point, I can make a  <br/>\ndifference. But if I don&#39;t and she&#39;s gone from irritated to melt-down  <br/>\n*now,* I have found it hard to help her. She&#39;s likely to tune me out  <br/>\ncompletely and push me away, especially if I try to guide her  <br/>\nphysically to a &quot;safe place&quot; (somewhere out of the situation for her  <br/>\nto regain her composure). I try not to talk to her too much, because  <br/>\nshe can&#39;t process what I&#39;m saying when she&#39;s feeling that overwhelmed.  <br/>\nBut, sometimes, I get agitated, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried, as suggested by an unschooling friend, to devise with  <br/>\nher a signal that will help her to know when to take a break, go for a  <br/>\nwalk, remove herself from the situation. She doesn&#39;t seem particularly  <br/>\nopen to my managing this - in other words, I feel as if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant me to identify when *I* think it&#39;s time to take a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t as hard when she was little to scoop her up and find  <br/>\nsomething more fun to do. But, now, she&#39;s bigger, strong and  <br/>\ndefensive. She also doesn&#39;t want me hanging around all the time. She  <br/>\nseems to *want* to negotiate these deep waters for herself, even if  <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t yet have the skills to swim in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to give her space, yet I want to protect her (and others, if  <br/>\nnecessary). And I want to increase the trust between us that I&#39;m there  <br/>\nto help, not hinder her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice and insight appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 1, 2008, at 11:47 PM, Lyla Wolfenstein wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; you describe almost exactly my experience with my son.  i don&#39;t get  <br/>\n&gt; defensively shy, but definitely reactive, and that never helps.  i  <br/>\n&gt; also wish i had listened more closely to my son years ago.  we are  <br/>\n&gt; paying the price now that we are listening, because his tolerance  <br/>\n&gt; for discomfort, boredom, overwhelm, stress, etc. of any kind is very  <br/>\n&gt; very low most of the time - lower, i think, than it would have been  <br/>\n&gt; if  i&#39;d been more responsive when he was younger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: dd likes to be at home w/ family most of the time","postDate":"1222954855","msgId":39003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdFRDA2NEM4LTMyMkEtNEM3NC04OTlCLTMxRjA0RUE5N0I3Q0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjMmlibCtzbzR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdjMmlibCtzbzR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39001,"nextInTopic":39026,"prevInTime":39002,"nextInTime":39004,"topicId":38986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I  told here he wouldn t likely be there because he was older and would be in the next audition time...all was going well when, in he walked.

She has always been <br/>\nconsidered shy by most people save the few she &quot;let in&quot; to her circle <br/>\nof comfort.  She is VERY small for her age...she is about 3 feet 5&quot; <br/>\nand only weighs 34 pounds.  She is very flexible and is always <br/>\nflipping and flopping, spending great deals of time upside down or <br/>\nsprawled like road kill.  My next two older children have been very <br/>\nactive in theatre, my 15 yo d. is planning on a career in theatre <br/>\nactually, so my almost 6 yo decided she was going to audtion for the <br/>\npart of Tiny Tim at our university theatre dept here for their <br/>\nproduction of Christmas Carol.  We were all concenered that she would <br/>\njust freeze up.  The day of the auditions she asked quite worried if <br/>\na certain boy from our town who had an arm amputated a few years back <br/>\nwould be at the auditions.  She is TERRIFIED by his lack of a <br/>\nforarm.  I have tried to talk with her about it but she just begins <br/>\nto cry and shake and demand to leave where ever we are.  This has <br/>\nmeant leaaving the public pool, the library, a friends party etc.  I <br/>\ntold here he wouldn&#39;t likely be there because he was older and would <br/>\nbe in the next audition time...all was going well when, in he <br/>\nwalked.  She grabbed me and started shaking and ssaying I can&#39;t do <br/>\nthis this take me home etc.   The theatre people thought she was just <br/>\nsuddenly scared about the audition. I calmed her down enough that she <br/>\nwould let a friend hold her off where she couldn&#39;t see the boy and <br/>\nquickly explained the situation to the director&#39;s assistant.  I then <br/>\nwent to my daughter and asked if she really wanted to leave, because <br/>\nI was not going to be able arrange for any other options for the <br/>\naudition.  She was still very upset but said she HAD to audition and <br/>\nwhat should she do?  I suggested she could let two of her homeschool <br/>\nolder friends hold her hands in and then sit where she couldn&#39;t see <br/>\nthe boy...she carried on back and forth for wveral minutes that she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do this but she HAd to She really wanted to be Tiny Tim she <br/>\nfinnally went in and a short while later the assistant came ot to <br/>\ntell me she was doing fine (No parents allowed in auditions)  She <br/>\ncame out a while later, being carried by one of her friends.  She <br/>\nsaid she had done ok but had been TOO SHY to sing the song she had <br/>\nrehearsed...We ifgure that was the end of that when she said on of <br/>\nthe other little girls had song a nice song...next day we get the <br/>\ncall that she was cast!!  She da been the only child that would allow <br/>\nScrooge to pick her up and flip her on to his shoulders.   She <br/>\nhad&#39;n&#39;t told us that!  She said well that wasn&#39;t scary that was just <br/>\nfun, I got to ride up on his shoulders and flip up and down.   I <br/>\nrealize this has been long bo my point is what has been viewed as <br/>\nweak points by many was the strong points that got her the role...Her <br/>\nsize that of a small three yo was a plus for the charecter, her <br/>\nfondness for cavorting through space landed her fearless on Scrooge&#39;s <br/>\nshoulders and her over coming the problem with the bot impresses the <br/>\ndirector and they thought she could over come stage freight...even if <br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t sing at the audition...She did cause she really wnted <br/>\nit.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1376589080\">So I enrolled my dd (6.5) in 4 classes this fall (she was interested <br/>\nin all of them at the time). And we dropped all 4 because she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to go back.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I told people about the classes--a few of these people <br/>\naren&#39;t too keen on homeschooling. I thought, foolishly, I would tell <br/>\nthem about it to show that we are (dd is) &quot;doing&quot; something with our <br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we are home once again most of the time because dd doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nto get out too much (though we try to a few times a week, and go home <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s ready for the most part).  And she&#39;s not fond of having <br/>\nnew friends over and figuring out those dynamics (she has a schooled <br/>\nneighbor friend she is comfortable playing with).  She really does <br/>\nenjoy having most of her time spent with our family, and <br/>\nindependently.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are trying a family Spanish class today taught by the adult son of <br/>\nmy unschooling friend.  Family classes sound like something I&#39;m going <br/>\nto pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also considered shy around people she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>\naround (she is not at all shy with us, her family or her good buddy <br/>\nor some of our extended family).  There&#39;s a part of me that is <br/>\nnervous that other people, especially extended family, will think <br/>\nthat I need to get her out more in order for her to &quot;get over&quot; this <br/>\nshyness (or socialization)--a belief that I have heard but don&#39;t <br/>\nagree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 3 year old dd.  It seems like our day goes by really <br/>\nquickly by the time I get food for the kids (several times a day), <br/>\nclean up the kitchen, do laundry, email a bit, answer kids&#39; <br/>\nquestions, wipe butts, and so on.  I feel guilty that I&#39;m not giving <br/>\ndd1 much for project and/or reading time which she really loves.  <br/>\nAlthough for the most part she keeps really busy during the day with <br/>\nher own inventions and playing with dd2.  And both really seem to be <br/>\nthriving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a large homeschooling group in my area, we are still meeting <br/>\nat a great park (until November 1st, then indoors).  Dd1 doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nto go.  If we go, I mostly hear whining about wanting to go home <br/>\n(mostly from dd1).  So now I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s best to not go right <br/>\nnow.  But I sure do love the adult contact.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to make peace with this so if/when people ask about the <br/>\nclasses or ask questions about what we do, I can be okay with their <br/>\nquestions. And also I wonder why I can&#39;t seem to get myself focused <br/>\nenough to do the one-on-one reading time, etc. my kids really love <br/>\nduring the day (we do read at night if we get in bed early enough).  <br/>\nI do think it&#39;s really important for me to be okay with <br/>\nmyself/accepting because then I feel much better, and am much <br/>\nhappier.  But I do wonder if there is something I&#39;m just not <br/>\nunderstanding about all this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mantra lately is &quot;We&#39;re always learning!&quot;  and that is helping me <br/>\nso much. I&#39;m also reading &quot;Deschooling Our Lives&quot; which makes me feel <br/>\nlike our unschooling choice is pretty much a no-brainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if anyone has any comments about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAmy in MN</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39120,"nextTopicId":39008}}
