I think if <br/>\nyou tell people your child is unschooled, they will probably assume <br/>\nthat you mean uneducated and everything the idea implies. Self-<br/>\neducated has different connotations. The conclusions people jump to <br/>\nare different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe semantics can be tricky sometimes. Especially when there are so <br/>\nmany parents who erroneously believe that children have to be <br/>\n&#39;taught&#39; everything (even when they can see with their own eyes that <br/>\nit isn&#39;t true!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what does my self-educated son do all day? Whatever he likes. No <br/>\ndifference there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the fact is, people rarely ask me about this. None of my <br/>\nrelatives have ever commented on my son&#39;s unusual lifestyle. My <br/>\nwife&#39;s mother, in fact, who&#39;s 86 and living with us now, is all for <br/>\nit - she gets to see the benefits every day. If a stranger, or the <br/>\nparent of one of my son&#39;s former schoolmates, should ask, they <br/>\ninvariably assume that I&#39;m doing school at home, so they&#39;ll <br/>\nask &quot;How&#39;s the homeschooling going?&quot; &quot;Yeah, great. I&#39;m very pleased <br/>\nwith Pat&#39;s progress.&quot; End of conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also keep a copy of Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s book &#39;If You Want to Be Rich <br/>\nand Happy, Don&#39;t Go to School&#39; handy - &quot;By the way, have you read <br/>\nthis book? It&#39;s most enlightening.&quot; - but I haven&#39;t had to use that <br/>\ntactic so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be useful to remind people that the institutional school <br/>\nsystem takes up only about 150-200 years of humanity&#39;s long history, <br/>\nit was designed to suit the needs of the Industrial Revolution and <br/>\nthe Digital Revolution that&#39;s now replaced it has changed all the <br/>\nrules about everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, even when my daughter was thriving in the school system, <br/>\nI would tell her that going to school was only part of her education <br/>\nand not necessarily the most important part. That&#39;s what I truly <br/>\nbelieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was always amongst what Robert Kiyosaki calls <br/>\nthe &#39;favoured five per cent&#39; - those students whose achievements <br/>\nreflect well on the school and who are consequently treated <br/>\nfavourably in ways that average students and below are not. That was <br/>\na crucial aspect of her experience and not unrelated to how she was <br/>\ntreated before she started school and outside of school during her <br/>\nschool years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, really, my son&#39;s lifestyle is no different to the lifestyle his <br/>\nsister has always enjoyed when she&#39;s at home. Do what you like and <br/>\ndon&#39;t do what you don&#39;t like. If it&#39;s good enough for me, it&#39;s good <br/>\nenough for my children. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing is to be convinced yourself of the value of what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing. That&#39;s not easy in the beginning, when you&#39;re <br/>\ndeschooling yourself, but it comes from observing the results, as <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing. When you&#39;re getting results people can&#39;t argue with, <br/>\nthey won&#39;t argue with your results. When you&#39;re certain that what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing is right, you project that into situations and other <br/>\npeople think twice about voicing negative opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there will always be people, I guess, who will look for things to <br/>\ncriticise in order to rationalise their own decisions about their own <br/>\nchildren. Perhaps they&#39;re secretly hoping and praying that what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing couldn&#39;t possibly be better than sending our children to <br/>\nschool. Unfortunately for them, it is. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;vespertine_nsw&quot; &lt;kezzdee@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First of all a quick intro.

I have now completely embraced <br/>\n&gt; unschooling and can&#39;t believe I ever doubted the concept.

What am I doing! This is <br/>\nabout the best, norman and natural way of learning for my son, not <br/>\nbeing out to prove myself to others. I think I need to work on my <br/>\nissues, as I don&#39;t think I&#39;m 100% confident yet. Thanks for helping me <br/>\nidentify that :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope that some people show genuine interest and I&#39;m able to stir <br/>\nsome inspiration to look further into unschooling. I don&#39;t know any <br/>\nunschoolers in real life, and would have loved to have discussed the <br/>\nideas with someone, especially when I was in highschool and sensed <br/>\ndeeply myself there was something so wrong about learning in a school. <br/>\nI just couldn&#39;t articulate at that time, why education felt so forced <br/>\nand unnatural.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":293964188,"authorName":"emmy","from":"&quot;emmy&quot; &lt;foundthings@...&gt;","profile":"scrapsnpieces","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] intro & explaining the foreign concept of unschooling to others","postDate":"1180583008","msgId":28932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYWEwMWM3YTMzNSRkOWUxMTZmMCRhZjU5Y2Q0NEBncmFwaGljcz4=","referencesHeader":"PGYzbDBnYit2bmp2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjMzM0UwNTItQzcxQy00OTE1LUI1RTQtMzYzMUZEN0U1NjZCQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28930,"nextInTopic":28934,"prevInTime":28931,"nextInTime":28933,"topicId":28929,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"ahhh yes the concept of simple answers is truly amazing!  sandra is so right. i mean can you really argue with we are always learning ! i usually add i know","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1738679348\">ahhh yes the concept of simple answers is truly amazing!  sandra is so right. i mean can you really argue with &quot;we are always learning&quot;! i usually add &quot;i know i learn something new everyday!&#39; i know i know yes there are people who can & will agrue,.,, LOL <br/>\n<br/>\ni never defend my parenting or schooling,in the traditional sense,my children &quot;speak&quot; for me. you will learn you either are confident or your not. so chose to be confident! yes worries will come, just check them at the door and move on. i get alot of people commenting on how respectful and smart my children are and then even asking me for advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nperspective. really the revelation is in HOW people look at things.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nemmy<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.cafepress.com/emmytofa<br/>\nwww.emmytofa.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 11:06 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] intro & explaining the foreign concept of unschooling to others<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-How<br/>\n  do you explain to strangers around you, the concept of unschooling<br/>\n  in brief, not just as &#39;homeschooling&#39; but as a lifestyle?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Very briefly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How do you explain to a very young child where babies come from? <br/>\n  They don&#39;t want to know EVERYthing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If a stranger asks, I say one thing, and if they ask another question <br/>\n  I say one more thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some of the things are:<br/>\n  &quot;It&#39;s like the open classroom of the 1970&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;It&#39;s a different way of living with children.&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;We find learning everywhere.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] intro & explaining the foreign concept of unschooling to others","postDate":"1180580815","msgId":28930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzMzNFMDUyLUM3MUMtNDkxNS1CNUU0LTM2MzFGRDdFNTY2QkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzbDBnYit2bmp2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYzbDBnYit2bmp2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28929,"nextInTopic":28932,"prevInTime":28929,"nextInTime":28931,"topicId":28929,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-How do you explain to strangers around you, the concept of unschooling in brief, not just as homeschooling but as a lifestyle?-=- Very briefly.

I&#39;m Kerrie, unschooling Mum to my son <br/>\nElijah. We&#39;re from Australia. I joined this list out of curiosity a <br/>\nwhile back but I found I wasn&#39;t quite in the headspace for it then. <br/>\nI was still caught up in the idea of teaching, and to be frank, <br/>\nthought most of you were a bit nuts. After many years of <br/>\nconditioning to thinkthe only way kids really learn is via formal <br/>\nlessons subjects and dictation, it was such a challenge to undo all <br/>\nof that and see learning for what it truly is (natural & constant, <br/>\nand at it&#39;s best when child-led.) I have now completely embraced <br/>\nunschooling and can&#39;t believe I ever doubted the concept. It really <br/>\ndoes seem radical, when you consider it against the general view in <br/>\nsociety of learning and education! But less radical the more I think <br/>\nabout it. It grows more normal every day, and my son&#39;s natural <br/>\ncuriosity, eye for detail, incredible memory and interest and <br/>\ngrowing  passion in the world around him are constant affirmations <br/>\nthis is the right path.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway! Enough about me. I have a question for you wise people. How <br/>\ndo you  explain to strangers around you, the concept of unschooling <br/>\nin brief, not just as &#39;homeschooling&#39; but as a lifestyle? I have had <br/>\npeople in disbelief that I &#39;allow&#39; my son to play with his food, to <br/>\npaint his body with waterpaints if he wants to, to watch tv whilst <br/>\neating his breakfast, and just other random life acts that he <br/>\nchooses to do himself. I find it difficult, without launching into a <br/>\ngreat spiel, explaining how we live and why it&#39;s important to me <br/>\nthat DS has autonomy. I find that feathers are really ruffled when I <br/>\ndon&#39;t &#39;pull my son up&#39;, and with our lack of rules and boundaries <br/>\nthat many other families seem to have. How in short, would I get the <br/>\nmessage across about what unchooling is, and to leave people with a <br/>\npositive understanding of it, not a negative (eg my kids run wild <br/>\nand I don&#39;t do anything about it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you had strangers ask you about your parenting practices or <br/>\nask &#39;what&#39;s unschooling&#39;, and if so, how do you answer without <br/>\nseeming like you&#39;re fishing for debate?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks  in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrie.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28850,"nextTopicId":28947}}
