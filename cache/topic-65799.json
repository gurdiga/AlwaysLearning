My DD1 often does not want to leave, unless it is for something arranged for her--a karate class or playdate, etc, then she is ready and willing to go.  I try to offer suggestions that she might enjoy--going to the park, the beach, to get a cookie at the coffeeshop, children&#39;s museum, etc, but she generally resists.  She wants to be home--doing art, watching movies, playing make-believe, etc.  I enjoy spending most of the day at home, too, but if I am indoors all day, I get antsy and feel isolated.  Inviting people over works, and I do that as often as I can.  But on days when we have nothing planned, I enjoy going out.  Lately she is resisting more and more, though if we do leave, as soon as she is out the door, she is enjoying herself.  It is the decision to leave where the power struggle occurs.  If it is my idea, she resists it.  She wants it to be her choice, she wants to feel in control. But I don&#39;t think it is too much to ask her to leave the house to do something we both find enjoyable!  Yet, she really resists.  I am not sure why the power-struggle occurs in this particular area, but I have the feeling there is a bigger picture I am not fully seeing, that is why I am writing here.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions to help me work with this dynamic would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much--<br/>\n&gt; Teresa<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":393776762,"authorName":"jumping.higher@rocketmail.com","from":"&quot;jumping.higher@...&quot; &lt;jumping.higher@...&gt;","profile":"jumping.higher@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: leaving the house/not leaving the house","postDate":"1329828465","msgId":65807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGppMDNwaCtiZDR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhONmk1VGYzdFNUTWFNZmUwOXQ9X0hRc1B4WmZpLUtUckN0QWNhOUw5b1RYQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65802,"nextInTopic":65815,"prevInTime":65806,"nextInTime":65808,"topicId":65799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Pam could you explain to me how you helped your children find a solution if one of them wanted to go out and the other one wanted to stay at home?

You could,<br/>\nat most, very sweetly and gently make a mild statement...&quot;We could go get<br/>\ncookies,&quot; but don&#39;t follow up and don&#39;t make it any stronger than that. Be<br/>\ntotally and thoroughly happy that you have the freedom to support your<br/>\nchild&#39;s interest in being at home.

Even if you&#39;re getting<br/>\nout less, knowing that for sure you ARE going to go out and be with people<br/>\ncan help ease that discomfort due to lack of social contact that a more<br/>\nextroverted person might feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had this problem because my middle child was the stay-at-home type. Not<br/>\nonly did &quot;I&quot; want to go out more, so did my older child - a LOT more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned, though, to value long uninterrupted hours of play - and I<br/>\nlearned to protect that for my kids. For my middle daughter, going out,<br/>\neven to do something fun (and she&#39;d make the best of it if we did go), was<br/>\ndisruptive to her day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287159722,"authorName":"teresa","from":"&quot;teresa&quot; &lt;teresaaregan@...&gt;","profile":"teresaaregan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"leaving the house/not leaving the house","postDate":"1329793399","msgId":65799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpodjFobit1cGFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65801,"prevInTime":65798,"nextInTime":65800,"topicId":65799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all-- We have been deschooling/unschooling for the past 6 months.

I have a 5 yo daughter and a 9 month old daughter and my current struggle revolves around leaving the house.  I enjoy leaving the house everyday, or most everyday.  It doesn&#39;t have to be anything special,  I just  enjoy the change of scenery, the social aspect, the fresh air.  It helps my state of mind and my mood, I feel happier getting out and about a bit.  My DD1 often does not want to leave, unless it is for something arranged for her--a karate class or playdate, etc, then she is ready and willing to go.  I try to offer suggestions that she might enjoy--going to the park, the beach, to get a cookie at the coffeeshop, children&#39;s museum, etc, but she generally resists.  She wants to be home--doing art, watching movies, playing make-believe, etc.  I enjoy spending most of the day at home, too, but if I am indoors all day, I get antsy and feel isolated.  Inviting people over works, and I do that as often as I can.  But on days when we have nothing planned, I enjoy going out.  Lately she is resisting more and more, though if we do leave, as soon as she is out the door, she is enjoying herself.  It is the decision to leave where the power struggle occurs.  If it is my idea, she resists it.  She wants it to be her choice, she wants to feel in control. But I don&#39;t think it is too much to ask her to leave the house to do something we both find enjoyable!  Yet, she really resists.  I am not sure why the power-struggle occurs in this particular area, but I have the feeling there is a bigger picture I am not fully seeing, that is why I am writing here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions to help me work with this dynamic would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much--<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65819,"nextTopicId":65470}}
