Talking about research and variations in different approaches to teaching, what&#39;s done in lab schools and other such &quot;alternative&quot; forms of education can be helpful to parents. A lot of homeschoolers have tried multiple curriculums and educational approaches already - they may be convinced that education is important but many Are looking for alternatives to the norm. The trick is talking about &quot;alternatives&quot; without saying something scary, like &quot;unschooling&quot; and without putting people on the defensive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect most people to want to know much about unschooling, but a lot of parents are relieved to be reminded that there&#39;s a whole range of &quot;normal&quot; - and when they can relax about that, its easier for them to make choices that are kinder and gentler toward their kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling Groups","postDate":"1282700488","msgId":56978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5MzE5MC4zMjM4Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5N0Y1QUE5LTE1NjUtNDIyNS04MzRCLTc5M0U0RDI3OTI1MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGk1MWZwdisxNnZ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTk3RjVBQTktMTU2NS00MjI1LTgzNEItNzkzRTREMjc5MjUxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56974,"nextInTopic":56991,"prevInTime":56977,"nextInTime":56979,"topicId":56876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***IF an unschooling family joins any group (even an unschooling group) they will have an opportunity to practice tolerance for other people s beliefs.*** This","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-791766913\">***IF an unschooling <br/>\nfamily joins any group (even an unschooling group) they will have an <br/>\nopportunity to practice tolerance for other people&#39;s beliefs.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes back to that whole right and wrong thing.

I initially joined just to get local info, etc...  They dont do much other than meet to discuss curriculum, and have &#39;literature&#39; class etc...... We tried to do the park day with them once, but these moms are interested in whos whos, and whats what,  what curriculum you use, and what church you attend, etc....(small town :) It wasnt about the kids. (and alot of the parenting made me CRINGE) <br/>\nWe went by the park another day when the weather was nice and there were alot of people, so we stopped.  (It wasnt &#39;park day &#39;)  The kids had fun, and the oldest chatted with some other older kids, in between playing with the younger ones, etc.... It was much more fun than the homeschool group park day. <br/>\nThe kids also wanted to do soccer, which wasnt available for local homeschoolers, so I coordinated a &#39;league&#39; and we had 5 teams that played against our local schools.  Again most of the parents are extremely religious , etc.... It went great, and the kids had fun , but it was because of the soccer. We werent there to socialize, persay. (I stayed busy and didnt get in on the mom conversations)  If we had to sit around and chat about homeschooling, common interests,  parenting styles and philosophy, it wouldnt prob go so well.  I posted something about John Holt on our local group(an fyi type post for a newbie)  Then a fellow group busybody posted how we should propose legislation for regulation, etc.....  <br/>\nThe only other mom I know of in the group who unschools, had a tween &#39;group&#39; get together at her house.  (They allow tv, video games, etc.....)That day another group member who attended the playdate started a thread on the group for a &#39;new, chrisitan only&#39; tween group weekly get together.....It was SOOOOOOO rude.......and the unschooling  mom left the group, and her kids feelings were really hurt. <br/>\nSo......we unschool, and keep the kid socializing pretty light, and live life. We are  not heavily into any  local groups. If we want to go to the park, we go...If we want to got to the museum we go..... we dont wait for a group field trip or something &#39;homeschool&#39; related.  Were not generally very &#39;groupy&#39; people anyway, and being independent from that works well for us.  When I need like minds or an opinion, I come here .... So far, so good  :) <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;joanne.lopers&quot; &lt;wilmalv@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am looking for some suggestions from others who have been part of  unschooling groups in their areas on how to help make those groups attractive to other unschoolers.

It was an hour&#39;s drive each way, and that was part of the trouble, but the social scene was another part - a bunch of kids, and not always the exact same kids, both factors that are a bit stressful to her. She&#39;d had a similar issue come up this week with going swimming at a nearby creek - George likes to go with a group of parents, so he can socialize, but can&#39;t always get the same group together, and Mo&#39;s not as thrilled about going as she was at the beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; OTOH the few people I know who live as though their and their kids&#39; desires are the only things that matter regardless of courtesy or lines or crowds of people waiting or any one else - they aren&#39;t unschoolers.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving around communes and travelling folks, I tend to meet unschoolers who let their kids run amok, especially boys. There&#39;s some of the &quot;too good for school and rules and you&quot; thing going on there, for sure, and a certain amount of wildness among the kids seems to be a kind of rebellion - parts of their lives (food, tv) are very controlled. In a way it reminds me of the stereotype of the minster&#39;s kids - or scoutmaster&#39;s kids. Their lives have some very rigid boundaries so they go a little nuts whenever they get the chance. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling Groups","postDate":"1282669586","msgId":56948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1RDNGMEQ5LTg2REItNDNGMS1CNEVGLTQ4M0Y1RUJCQUY0NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk0dm9yOStyNmNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk0dm9yOStyNmNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56946,"nextInTopic":56949,"prevInTime":56947,"nextInTime":56949,"topicId":56876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I have only once been in a situation where a kid was behaving inappropriately and the mom was not stopping it, with the apparent belief that it was OK for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-815899969\">-=-I have only once been in a situation where a kid was behaving  <br/>\ninappropriately and the mom was not stopping it, with the apparent  <br/>\nbelief that it was OK for her son to be climbing the tree in the  <br/>\nprotected park.

I like some of these parents in a light and pleasant way. Others I love dearly - but my friendship level for the parents is irrelevant to Jayn and her love of her friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nHer unschooling friends are not very local to us - we tend to have to travel and make an event out of seeing them. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has been pretty much refusing to go to park days for a few years now, except for sometimes travelling to see one of her friends (also 10 years old)and keeping her company at the park so that her little brother can enjoy his time at park day with his younger peers. They tend to go off together and talk about stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* am the one who wants to go to park days because then I get to commune with parents, some of whom will be unschoolers and will be interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the people I love most in the world are unschooling parents who I have met at the conferences. Many of them live a long way away, even in other countries. We just have a lot in common and laugh a lot. It goes beyond unschooling, and into common core beliefs and genuine simpatico. I seek them out when I have the chance, because they are cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people I love, but Jayn doesn&#39;t want to hang out with their kids. And unlike when I was growing up and I was forced to play with kids in whom I had no particular interest just because my mother was friends with their parents, I&#39;m not going to insist that Jayn engage with people she doesn&#39;t like, on my account. There will be plenty of time for that when she is in the workforce. (Just kidding, sort of.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when both of us come together in our preferences and we both have people we care about and whose company we enjoy in the same setting, then that is something for which to be grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\n==She thinks some people live as though there are special laws of  <br/>\nphysics, particular legislation, and different landlord expectations  <br/>\nof people just because they&#39;re unschooling.===<br/>\n<br/>\nWould people who live as though societal rules don&#39;t apply to them or their family be that way anyway? Does unschooling just throw that mindset into higher relief?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this an assumption that non-unschoolers make about us? Is it like schooling parents making assumptions about the character traits and behavior of home schooled kids as being because they are home schooled rather than who they are?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only once been in a situation where a kid was behaving inappropriately and the mom was not stopping it, with the apparent belief that it was OK for her son to be climbing the tree in the protected park. Other home schooling parents talking the incident over later said derisively, &quot;She let him do that because they&#39;re unschoolers.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I said, &quot;There&#39;s nothing in unschooling about letting kids ignore rules when they are out in public places&quot; or similar words.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the organizers had asked her to curb him, she was surprised that they were being so picky, and seemed to think it unreasonable, but she had him come down anyway. They had a quiet conversation and the upshot was that he wasn&#39;t happy to be there without being allowed to climb, so they left and went somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat too was observed with some derision by the other parents whose kids did not have a choice about being at this educational opportunity field trip. (We left too, shortly after, because Jayn was bored. I can only imagine that we were dissed too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH the few people I know who live as though their and their kids&#39; desires are the only things that matter regardless of courtesy or lines or crowds of people waiting or any one else - they aren&#39;t unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

There definately is such an ebb and flow of things.  Today there was a wonderful good-bye to a family moving across the country.  What a great memory.  We will talk about this one day for a long time I am sure!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do enjoy our group emensely and will just let go of the concerns I was having.  No biggy and I kinda thought that.  My own insecuries creeping in.  Don&#39;t get too idealistic about how I think things should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiked the suggestion for the teasing.  It is not a huge problem and my kids apparently have on occasion been a part of it. I would have prefered that someone let me know so I could have dealt with it right away.  Sometimes a script helps me because that conditioned anger from the past surfaces and I don&#39;t handle a situation as well as when I have something already planned to say in circumstances that make me edgy.  It can be hard to retrain yourself to respond differently than how you were raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe sound pretty typical of what is going on then.  Friendships are hard to foster and I guess that can happen in school too.  The neighbourhood we live in does not have many kids so we have to seek out all of our social activities and it seems to be taking a long time to making the jump to friendships where there are house visits.  We do have some great space to play so maybe when the weather is cooler I&#39;ll have to do open play at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious what Holly has been saying about unschooling?

I figure that not everyone is <br/>\nunschooling, even if they connect with that style of homeschooling more than, <br/>\nsay, classical homeschooling.  When Chamille was young there just weren&#39;t other <br/>\nunschoolers around.  There were a few here and there, wrong gender, too far <br/>\naway, too young, too old, wrong interests, etc.  Chamille knew some of them, but <br/>\nmostly she befriended other homeschoolers and kids who went to school.  That is <br/>\nwhat we were used to, mixing with others.  We were more concerned with whether <br/>\nor not the kids liked each other and got along and had similar interests.  I <br/>\nrarely talked about unschooling at park days and homeschool gatherings.  One <br/>\ntime I did, and the woman never spoke to me again, and went on to become a big <br/>\nvoice on the local list for eclectic and charter schools and teaching &quot;the <br/>\nbasics&quot;.  I figure people are going to do what they are drawn to, if it works <br/>\nfor them, then it does, if it doesn&#39;t they&#39;ll hopefully seek out something else <br/>\nand that information is out there in abundance now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our area, there is a larger more &quot;all inclusive&quot; unschooling list and a <br/>\nradical unschooling list.  Those families that want to meet up with other <br/>\nunschooling families and really are living those ideas everyday can find that on <br/>\nthe radical list.  My experience, and this is just *my* experience, is that it <br/>\nis easier to hang out with a mixed group of homeschoolers than it is to hang out <br/>\nwith unschoolers who say they unschool, but don&#39;t really live it.  It&#39;s <br/>\nbeautiful when you meet other families and you get along wonderfully with the <br/>\nadults and the kids get along wonderfully with each other too.  It&#39;s rare, but <br/>\nit does happen.  I have a couple of local friends that are like that in my area, <br/>\nand they are all kids that are Margaux&#39;s age, so the younger set, she&#39;s almost <br/>\n9.   We never found that with Chamille and that&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m very careful with <br/>\nmy special unschooling friends, to not over do it, to take it easy, and to keep <br/>\noutings and get togethers happy and fun because I do NOT want to lose them or <br/>\ntake advantage of that relationship!<br/>\n<br/>\n***Also, some suggestions on how to handle teasing or unkind behaviour within <br/>\nthe group.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of thing will happen in ANY group get together where there are lots of <br/>\nkids and personalities all mixed together.  I&#39;ve always addressed the people <br/>\ninvolved directly.  What helps more than anything else is to play with my kids <br/>\nat any gathering, or be near enough to hear and jump in as needed.  Then, when <br/>\nit seems like the kids have a rapport with one another, you can let them wander <br/>\naway and do their own thing.  It takes time, lots of time, and it&#39;s very <br/>\ndependent on personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would like to see the group grow and it seems to be at a stand still right <br/>\nnow, although that could be because of the hot summer.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite things that people have done on lists like those, is to post <br/>\ninteresting things with out any expectations of anyone responding.  People will <br/>\nread them.  I like it when people post outings and invite others along.  I find <br/>\nthat after you get to know a couple of families, facebook is an easier place to <br/>\ndo that than lists.  Again, that&#39;s just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving zero expectations of other unschooling families has helped me get along <br/>\nwith other unschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have an answer to getting older kids involved in park days.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe able to drag my older daughter to a park day.  She would have to be pretty <br/>\nbored to go to a park day with me and her sister.  Her interests are just very <br/>\ndifferent right now.  She goes to the park with just the 3 of us all the time, <br/>\nthe park right next to our house, but as a planned outing with multiple others, <br/>\nnot going to happen.  (and because I&#39;ve said this, she&#39;ll probably prove me <br/>\nwrong, it&#39;s been known to happen!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe longest running local park day in my area has one host at any time who shows <br/>\nup rain or shine.  It&#39;s been running for about 18 yrs or something like that. <br/>\n They have a few established things that happen one time each year, they do a <br/>\nbook swap and a clothing swap.  They always sit in the same location, they get <br/>\nthere early and put out chairs and blankets, the time and place hasn&#39;t changed <br/>\nin all those years.  The park has wooded trails that open up to a river and <br/>\nbeach with a dock for older kids to go and do their thing away from the younger <br/>\nkids.  People have the option of multiple activities because it&#39;s a very large <br/>\npark with baseball diamonds, play ground for older and younger kids, lots of <br/>\nswings, trails, bbq pits and covered patios, bathrooms, water, shade trees, <br/>\nplaces to play games, and during the summer there is a concession stand.  It has <br/>\na large parking lot and is near a bus stop.  All those things can make the <br/>\ndifference in whether or not a long running park day will be successful or not. <br/>\n All that other stuff like water play and hoola hoops are extra, liking icing on <br/>\nthe cake.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling Groups","postDate":"1282152702","msgId":56880,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3OUVERkZGLUUyQ0UtNDdGOC1CMjQ4LUQ1MEIwNkYwRDU5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk0Z3Y5MituZXNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk0Z3Y5MituZXNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56876,"nextInTopic":56886,"prevInTime":56879,"nextInTime":56881,"topicId":56876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was involved in a local weekly meet-up group for  many years.
