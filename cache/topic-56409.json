At<br/>\nbedtime (which is about midnight in our family) I had just tucked in and<br/>\nsaid goodnight to our two youngest (8 and 11 yo boys) and was climbing<br/>\ninto my own bed when I heard one of them calling me.  My knee-jerk<br/>\nreaction was a blast of annoyance - very typical of me in that<br/>\nsituation, exacerbated by the fact that I&#39;d felt crummy all day and was<br/>\nreally looking forward to collapsing into bed.  I huffed out an angry<br/>\nbreath, started to head back to their room and suddenly had a thought<br/>\nfrom something I&#39;d read here recently (or maybe on Sandra&#39;s website or<br/>\nthe RU Network): &quot;First, breathe and center yourself.&quot;  So I took a deep<br/>\nbreath, and as I inhaled I felt my whole being kind of slide into place<br/>\n- it was weird, almost a tangible sensation - and suddenly I felt<br/>\ncompletely peaceful.  I walked into their room with a smile on my face<br/>\nand asked if either of them had called me.  It was ds 11, he wanted me<br/>\nto set up his extra pillow (which was on the floor leaning against his<br/>\nbed) behind him so he could sit up and read for a bit.  Normally in this<br/>\ncircumstance I&#39;d have walked into the room annoyed and impatient and<br/>\nwould have responded to this request by going on a rant about why he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t just reach down and pick it up himself, why he had to call me<br/>\nall the way back into his room for that, how tired and crummy I was<br/>\nfeeling and there is no reason why I have to be the one to do it since<br/>\nhe&#39;s perfectly capable himself!  (You get the picture.)  Last night I<br/>\njust said, &quot;Sure!&quot; and set his pillows up behind him and gave them both<br/>\nanother kiss goodnight and then went to bed feeling exhausted but very<br/>\npeaceful - and very thankful for my networks of unschoolers, from whom<br/>\nI&#39;m learning the precious principle of abundance.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Leah Rose<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":458624268,"authorName":"dola dasgupta-banerji","from":"dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;doladg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] guilt over saying no and what am I doing \twrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280414702","msgId":56463,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluYWZOQVN1aDYwd3pOTGpfbXotMlFlRkoxUFB2cW56ZUt3N2JEU0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwMDczRTc1LTY0Q0YtNEFDNy05OUZGLTM0RTE5QUJCMTUwRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkybmQ3cCtmaTI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW12Y0xxY0tndkZrbnQySFRoR0E0U0QxVGVlc2oyMk9wX3NuZk1UQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8NTAwNzNFNzUtNjRDRi00QUM3LTk5RkYtMzRFMTlBQkIxNTBGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56458,"nextInTopic":56480,"prevInTime":56462,"nextInTime":56464,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I know exactly what you mean.

Instead of saying no, we can say, &quot;ooh, that is a cool toy (or whatever it is), let&#39;s put that on the wish list when we get home.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280349563","msgId":56447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDM0EwQkM3MTczODRBNkQ4MUMwQkM4MTJBNDlCMjY1QENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkycGVuZys0YnZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkycGVuZys0YnZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56446,"nextInTopic":56449,"prevInTime":56446,"nextInTime":56448,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: flyingtwinsmom Sent: Wednesday, July 28, 2010 9:26 AM To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: guilt over saying no and what am I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-855548326\">From: flyingtwinsmom <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 28, 2010 9:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve tried to share more with them, but they are very sensitive and get easily overwhelmed and frightened so I try to be very careful about not giving them too much.

I have one daughter that likes to be given lots information and one daughter that just wants a simple yes or no. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy you are sharing information with them? What are your motivations? Do you have any expectations tied to sharing the information? Are you sharing information because you want them to feel like a partner? Are you sharing information with them so they will stop asking for stuff so that you can avoid saying no? If the purpose of giving them information is so they will stop asking, then you will be disappointed. Even though my husband and I know the budget and have all of the pieces of information, we will ask each other about getting something that isn&#39;t in the budget. Knowing the budget and being part of the process doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t want stuff. It also doesn&#39;t take away the disappointment that I experience when the answer is no. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the amount of information to share can be very situational. There are times when I feel like knowing more about something and then there are times when I don&#39;t want to be bothered with too much information. My girls are the same way. Sometimes giving more information helps and sometimes it is just annoying. Like Meredith says, it is a puzzle. There is no one size fits all answer because every family and every situation is different. Sometimes, the nicest thing that you can do is say no because the reasons behind the no are too overwhelming to try to share with a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280348642","msgId":56446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkycTNsMittczU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0ODQ3OC45NzgwMS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56445,"nextInTopic":56447,"prevInTime":56445,"nextInTime":56447,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===One of my favorite toys stores is downtown and it s really big and has lots of really amazing stuff, but my favorite aspect is that it has a huge section","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-208624091\">===One of my favorite toys stores is downtown and it&#39;s really big and has lots of really amazing stuff, but my favorite aspect is that it has a huge section with $.10 and $.25 tubs of interesting things.

I&#39;ve been afraid to try this with them because I don&#39;t want them to worry too much.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes back to what Jenny said about parents&#39; reflecting a feeling of abundance in spite of how tight finances may be. If you are frightened about what&#39;s going to happen and how you will make ends meet, your kids are going to pick up on that. If you share information in an anxious or negative way, that will surely create feelings of worry on their part. If you can&#39;t currently share the details of your budget with them in a non-anxious way, don&#39;t share it with them until you can approach it from a &quot;what we DO have&quot; perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son definitely picks up on my worry. He knows our finances are tight right now, but he doesn&#39;t know that the emergency-surgery vet bill we incurred over the weekend means we&#39;re in the hole until payday next week -- him knowing that would stress him out unnecessarily. I can&#39;t go to the grocery store to buy some of the favorite foods of his we&#39;re out of right now, BUT I can (much as Jenny said) look at what&#39;s in the pantry and fridge and come up with some other meals he likes but doesn&#39;t have as often -- chocolate-chip pancakes or french toast, for example. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t do is say &quot;we can&#39;t afford that&quot; and then turn around and buy something that is truly unnecessary. If we go into Hastings (video game/dvd/book store) and I say, &quot;We can only spend $10,&quot; then I need to be sure I don&#39;t change that just because I find a magazine I want. If he wants to rent a game and I want a magazine and the two together are more than $10, I&#39;ll rent the game for him and get the magazine another time (or not). Or I&#39;ll forgo the magazine so we can each get a candy bar -- for us, a candy bar gives the feeling of abundance! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to do comparison shopping with your kids. Maybe one day go to the grocery store when you only need to pick up a few things -- look with them at how much favorite snacks (chips, soda, frozen foods, etc.) cost and see what options you have to decrease those costs -- maybe buy a generic brand, maybe get the ingredients to make whatever it is from scratch (homemade potato chips!), maybe only buy certain things every other shopping trip. I know my son was astounded the first time he saw how much a family-size bag of chips costs (&quot;and it&#39;s only half-full, Mom!!&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can afford to get a bag of chips OR a particular frozen pizza he likes, I let him make the choice. If we can&#39;t really afford either, he&#39;ll get a candy bar. Or I&#39;ll get the ingredients to make cookies or rice krispy treats. I find ways to keep things around that equate to &quot;treats&quot;, for him *and* for my husband and I, because they create the feeling of abundance in our diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while we only had one car and when my husband would be working out of town for a week at a time, leaving Andrew and I without a mode of transportation while he was gone, I struggled with finding a feeling of abundance, especially during the summer when it was too stinkin&#39; hot to be outdoors without wilting. We couldn&#39;t afford a second car, but we *could* afford a small above-ground pool so we saved up and bought one and my hubby got it all set up for us and showed me how to maintain it when he was out of town -- being able to stay cool outdoors in our own backyard in the dead of summer helped *me* get out of that &quot;stuck&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t have&quot; mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know things are going to be tight in the near future, maybe you could start stashing away a small amount of money each payday as your &quot;fun money&quot; fund now for when you can no longer afford to stash money away. That could be ice-cream-truck money when you&#39;re at the park, or dollar-store or yard-sale money when all the current toys are stale, or the entrance fee to the local state park for a day trip, or movie-rental money, etc. I know Michael&#39;s and Target both have $1 clearance bins and I often pick up a handful of stuff out of those and stash them away for a rainy day.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280347566","msgId":56444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGRDMwQjhFLTBCNTMtNEZBRi04NDk5LTBGRUU5OUQyMjU2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkycGVuZys0YnZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkycGVuZys0YnZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56443,"nextInTopic":56445,"prevInTime":56443,"nextInTime":56445,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I ve tried to share more with them, but they are very sensitive and get easily overwhelmed and frightened so I try to be very careful about not giving them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802235512\">-=-I&#39;ve tried to share more with them, but they are very sensitive and  <br/>\nget easily overwhelmed and frightened so I try to be very careful  <br/>\nabout not giving them too much.

Won&#39;t that follow them all their lives? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reality is that many (most?) of us won&#39;t be able to give our children EVERYTHING they want. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say &quot;yes&quot; when we can, they&#39;ll understand that when we say &quot;no&quot; it&#39;s because we truly can&#39;t do or fund whatever request was made. For families who are deschooling, that&#39;s not going to happen overnight. <br/>\n<br/>\nBe consistent in saying &quot;yes&quot; as often as possible -- not just about money stuff but also about other &quot;can you&quot; and &quot;will you&quot; requests. If you find yourself saying or thinking &quot;no&quot;, stop and ask yourself &quot;why not?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night my son and I went to the video game store. He found something he wanted but we&#39;d forgotten to take his gift card with us and there&#39;s not enough money in our checking account right now for me to have bought it for him. He asked if we could go home, get the g.c., and go back. My first answer was, &quot;no, it&#39;s nearly dark out&quot; (I don&#39;t like driving my unreliable car after dark when my hubby&#39;s out of town and my kiddo&#39;s aware of that). But I didn&#39;t like hearing the &quot;no&quot; come out of my mouth so I thought &quot;why not?&quot; and then told him, &quot;if it&#39;s not raining hard, we can get the g.c. and come back tonight, but if it is raining hard I&#39;d rather wait until tomorrow because driving in the dark AND rain is really stressful for me.&quot; It wasn&#39;t raining hard between the store and our house, so when we pulled into the driveway I asked if he wanted to grab his g.c. and go back to the store. He said no, that waiting til tomorrow (today) would be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows that when I say I can&#39;t afford something, I really can&#39;t afford it. He knows &quot;no&quot; doesn&#39;t come out of my mouth often, and that when it does I will usually follow it with a &quot;but&quot;. (&quot;I&#39;m not comfortable driving when it&#39;s dark *and* rainy, but I&#39;ll bring you back to the store after you wake up tomorrow.&quot;) <br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t expect EVERYTHING, but he *does* expect me to be honest with him, because I *have* been honest with him day after day, year after year. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe expectations he has of other people is they be honest and treat him kindly. At his birthday and Christmas, he expects gifts from certain family members because they&#39;ve given him gifts every year, but he knows other family members don&#39;t send anything and so he doesn&#39;t expect anything from them. When he&#39;s ready to live on his own, he knows he&#39;ll be paying rent and utilities. He knows when he gets a job, he&#39;ll have certain duties that will have to be done in order to get a paycheck. So, no, having abundance doesn&#39;t equate to always expecting everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;The best I can&quot; (was  guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280340446","msgId":56432,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCREFBNzRCLURFMUEtNEUyQi1BRDE3LTJFODE3NjQ0NTI4RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkycHBiOStmamJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkycHBiOStmamJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56431,"nextInTopic":56434,"prevInTime":56431,"nextInTime":56433,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... doing the best I can so I refuse to feel bad about it?-=- Somewhere people are picking up a kind of self-soothing mantra about knowing that they re doing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-888629753\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt; Is it something that I just set in my mind saying that I know I&#39;m  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>doing the best I can so I refuse to feel bad about it?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere people are picking up a kind of self-soothing mantra about  <br/>\nknowing that they&#39;re doing the best they possibly can, and that their  <br/>\nchildren are doing the best they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh... way to lose the motivation to change.

Rosie, who is 19, now <br/>\nwalks around a bookstore and ends up with 15 or 20 books piled in her <br/>\narms. My heart sometimes skips a beat when she walks up to me loaded <br/>\ndown with all those books and my first thought is sometimes, &quot;Oh no, <br/>\nshe&#39;s going to want to BUY all those and be so disappointed when she <br/>\ncan&#39;t.&quot;  But that&#39;s a left-over thought from when she was little and it <br/>\nis instantly replaced, these days, by fascination with how she decides <br/>\nwhich (if any) to actually buy. She piles them all on a table and picks <br/>\nup one at a time and puts them into piles of &quot;REALLY want right now,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Wish I could get now but can wait,&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t really want this one <br/>\nthat much compared to the others.&quot; So then she looks at the &quot;REALLY want <br/>\nright now&quot; pile, which usually still has 5 or 6 books in it. And she <br/>\nopens each one and thnks about it and kind of puts them in order of <br/>\npriority. VERY often, she&#39;ll then pick up just the top one and say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\njust going to get this one, for now.&quot; Sometimes she&#39;ll pick two. Very <br/>\nvery seldom will she choose more.  She does a bit of moaning and <br/>\ngroaning and agonizing as she makes her choices - but I never am <br/>\ninvolved unless she asks my opinion about a book. If she asks my <br/>\nopinion, usually it is a comparison question - &quot;Which one do you think I <br/>\nshould get?&quot; And I&#39;ll often ask, &quot;Well, which do you think you&#39;d want to <br/>\nread right away - like in the car on the way home?&quot; Something like that, <br/>\nto help her think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got a Nook a couple of weeks ago, and she&#39;s having no problem at all <br/>\nwith over-buying, which I can see could be very easy and tempting - with <br/>\nthe new technology. Instead, she&#39;s concentrated on downloading free <br/>\nbooks - all the classics that she either already loves or those she&#39;s <br/>\nnever read. I think she&#39;s only actually purchased one or maybe two books.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Rosie was little, we&#39;d always right away get something to carry <br/>\naround with her in the grocery store - a bag of beans or a bag of rice. <br/>\nShe called it her &quot;baby&quot; and pretended to nurse it and played happily <br/>\nwith it while I shopped.

Moreso if we&#39;re shopping when the aisles are busy. So I generally grocery shop later in the evening so Andrew can hang at home with my hubby. But if my hubby&#39;s out of town and Andrew and I need certain groceries during that time, I tend to opt for a less busy, smaller grocery store that requires less walking to get the things we want so we can be in and out quicker.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking before getting to the store about how much money is available to be spent is extremely helpful. Go to the areas of the store they&#39;re interested in first and allow them plenty of time to look around. Breathe, keep your focus on enjoying the time with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they can&#39;t decide between two things and you *truly* can&#39;t afford to get both things, tell them they can hang onto the two things while you do your other shopping and then they&#39;ll need to decide which they want to get this time. Sometimes being put on the spot to make a decision (&quot;hurry up, we have to go!&quot;) results in not being able to make a decision, so give them time and space to make a decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you notice you&#39;re starting to feel anxious, stop right then and take a couple deep breaths and purposely shift your perspective. If that&#39;s not your usual way of being, it *will* take thought and effort. But it *does* come easier the longer you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: guilt over saying no and what am I doing wrong?-re-breathless","postDate":"1280335163","msgId":56426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVENzk4RUEwLUJENzUtNDQ1MC05QzRELUUwQzk1RTk2NzA1Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkycGZ2YSt0ZWFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkycGZ2YSt0ZWFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56425,"nextInTopic":56427,"prevInTime":56425,"nextInTime":56427,"topicId":56409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m sure this applies to every situation so do you do this in the middle of the store while they want both things or how do you handle it?

It <br/>\nisn&#39;t considered &quot;nice&quot; for adults to express their desires for more and <br/>\nmore and more - it would be thought of as greedy and grasping and trying <br/>\nto live too high, etc. But everybody has wants they can&#39;t satisfy.

Help them, over the next <br/>\nfew years, to be more appreciative of what they do have by being clearly <br/>\nappreciative yourself, while not expecting them to be, yet.

That&#39;s not a good way to build a relationship. If you were wishing your husband brought you flowers and he bought you a new coffee pot and tickets to a show, you might still wish for flowers - not because you don&#39;t appreciate what he&#39;s done, but because you have this other unmet desire. So be compassionate about those unmet desires your girls have. Commiserate over the fact that they aren&#39;t going to the beach. Ask them to tell you what would be wonderful and see if you can make some plans for  the day when you *can* go. Maybe they&#39;d rather re-arrange the plans that are already set up - but they could be really excited about what&#39;s coming up and *still* be disappointed, too.

If guilt is a habit you have, then that&#39;s something for you to work on, but don&#39;t blame that on your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you feeling guilty because you wish you could do more? Give them more? It might help you be more clear about that wistfulness - just like your girls, you desire some things you can&#39;t have. Why aren&#39;t *you* grateful for what you *can* give them? That&#39;s not meant to be an attack, but a way for you to see how your own reaction is similar, in some ways, to your daughters&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point, it would be a good idea to talk about that, but Not when you&#39;re feeling resentful towards them or they seem to be resentful towards you.

Those kids don&#39;t have parents snuggling with them watching<br/>\nSpongebob and House, absorbing enough of the kids&#39; favorite video<br/>\ngames (and playing some!) to know the importance of beating the Boss<br/>\nthat was plaguing them, supportively making a stop at a second<br/>\nrestaurant so no one has to eat food they don&#39;t like.<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n____________<br/>\nMy girls have this attitude. It&#39;s not about everything, but it is about enough to drive me nuts. They have many of their own electronics, including laptops and IPods. They get to go away relatively often. We try to accommodate and offer as much as we can, and yet we still hear &quot;but why can&#39;t we go to the beach? Our cousins get to.&quot; Never mind the fact that we have a Disney vacation planned for this fall. And this is just one example of which there are many.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still in the deschooling phase, but am I missing something here? I&#39;m feeling like they just aren&#39;t appreciating things. And maybe they are still a bit young(10) to understand that they can&#39;t have everything, but I&#39;m just clueless as to why my girls sound more like they think they are entitled to have everything than kids that are grateful. We have always tried our best to accommodate them, not just by giving them things but by doing what they want also. Lately, I feel like I&#39;ve created monsters by this though because they just want more and more. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m trying to work out what I could be doing wrong. I have always been at home with them. They have never been to school, but I was a &quot;school at home&quot; mom until recently. They have a 2 parent home where we spend as much time as possible with them, and yet they still feel they are lacking because of what others have. I&#39;m not sure how I can move past my gut reaction of saying that they should be grateful for what they do have when they make me feel guilty because I can&#39;t give them something. And we are coming into some really tight financial times so my guilt and need to say no is going to increase tremendously. How can I successfully handle those times when I can&#39;t give them what they want?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56395,"nextTopicId":56513}}
