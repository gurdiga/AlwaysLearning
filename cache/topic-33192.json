I mentioned that not all children are ready to read when <br/>\nthey are 5 or 6 that some children are not ready until they are even <br/>\n10 or 12.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe &quot;discussed&quot; our views on children learning to read (she, of <br/>\ncourse, is very traditional public school minded).  I was so nervous <br/>\nbecause I am still learning myself about unschooling.  I told my <br/>\nsister that I am fairly new to unschooling and learning every day.  I <br/>\ntold her I am learning to trust my dd -- that she will learn to read <br/>\nwhen she is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother made a comment, &quot;Why do you think there is so much <br/>\nilliteracy in the world?&quot;  They both waited for me to respond, and to <br/>\ntell you the truth, I didn&#39;t know WHAT to say!  What I did say <br/>\nwas, &quot;I haven&#39;t studied about world illiteracy, but I do know that in <br/>\nour print-rich society and with a home where reading is valued, <br/>\nchildren can and do learn to read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister then told me that her son (10th grade) can only read on a <br/>\n5th grade level.  She told me all about his struggles with reading <br/>\nand how it is affecting all of his school work, how he hates reading, <br/>\netc. etc.  I asked her what kind of experience he had when he was in <br/>\nfirst grade or kindergarten or whatever, and she said in <br/>\nkindergarten, the teacher was sick a lot so they had lots of <br/>\ndifferent substitutes and all of the kids were in the same boat - <br/>\nunable to read.  She said he missed out on the basic phonics stuff so <br/>\nnow cannot read well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer son is very &quot;strong willed&quot; (her terms) and does not like <br/>\nto &quot;conform&quot;.  I asked if maybe he was rebelling against all the <br/>\ncoercion, bribes, threats, etc.  She just doesn&#39;t see that as a <br/>\npossibility.  She and her husband force him to read every day for 15 <br/>\nminutes (although I cannot see how they can make him actually read <br/>\nthe words and not just look at the page) and they withhold all <br/>\nhis &quot;privileges&quot; such as t.v., video games, friends, etc. until he <br/>\ncompletes his reading assignments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was not open to any ideas but really questioned my decision to <br/>\nunschool my dd.  She really did not want my advice, I am thinking.  I <br/>\nthink she and my mother had been discussing my way of homeschooling <br/>\n(my sister had been there at my parents house for several days) and I <br/>\nwas put into a position to have to defend what I believe to be the <br/>\nright way to raise my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest sister was always the &quot;smart&quot; one in my family of 12 kids <br/>\nand now goes around the U.S. giving seminars to doctors, nurses, and <br/>\nWIC employees regarding breastfeeding and the benefits.  She is on <br/>\nthe road much of the time, and even when she stayed home with her <br/>\nchildren when they were younger, she was always involved in her <br/>\nhusband&#39;s church activities.  In my opinion, she has probably never <br/>\nreally spent a lot of time directly interacting with her children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this conversation, I was feeling very unsure of myself, but <br/>\nwas able to turn the it around to something else not related <br/>\nto &quot;school&quot;.  Then another sister showed up (St. Patrick&#39;s Day is a <br/>\nbig thing in my family!) and she asked if I was still homeschooling.  <br/>\nShe talked about how she pulled her son from school when he was in <br/>\nfirst grade because the teacher told her that her son could read a <br/>\nword -- &quot;monkey&quot; without sounding it out.  She was so upset by this <br/>\n(I can&#39;t really understand why, though), that she pulled him out to <br/>\nteach him phonics the &quot;correct&quot; way.  She only homeschooled for a <br/>\ncouple of years and then put her kids in school.  She thinks I am <br/>\ndoing my dd a disservice to not have a phonics program in place and <br/>\nthat if I were to get a really good one (&quot;Bob Jones is the best,&quot; she <br/>\ndeclares), dd would be reading in a short while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew.  I&#39;m glad that get-together is over with.  But now I am feeling <br/>\na little discouraged.  How do others handle these kinds <br/>\nof &quot;discussions&quot; with family members?  I guess most people think they <br/>\nare doing the right thing and that their way of looking at things is <br/>\nthe best way and so they try to convince others.  It is just <br/>\nupsetting that my sisters aren&#39;t really interested in learning about <br/>\nother approaches but want me to see their way as being the right and <br/>\nbest way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33264,"nextTopicId":33258}}
