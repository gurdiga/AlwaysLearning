Nothing polite comes to mind. Maybe a suggestion that what they do <br/>\nisn&#39;t unschooling AT ALL, and is really traditional school-at-home. That they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t dress their wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing and call it chocolate cause <br/>\ntheir &quot;accelerated&quot; kids probably know the difference anyway. The kid I <br/>\nreally feel bad for is the ungifted, adopted one. Geeze what a witch! To <br/>\nremind a child every day that not only is he dumb (I know she doesn&#39;t say <br/>\nthat, but she sure implies it!) but not her real kid either. <br/>\nMaybe you could compile all of the lists responses into an email, with a <br/>\nshort explanation that you shared what she wrote with others who were curious <br/>\ntoo. And a big PS telling her... never mind, that wasn&#39;t nice either. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8639,"nextTopicId":8700}}
