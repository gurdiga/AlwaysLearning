Kelly Lovejoy and I<br/>\nare co-founders of SOS, School&#39;s Out Support, the SC<br/>\nUnschoolers group hosting a conference in October.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my knowledge, we are the only unschool<br/>\nsupport group in the state.  Notice of the bill in<br/>\nquestion was prominently posted on our site.  In fact,<br/>\nI sent out 2 notices to members urging them to call<br/>\nand email the sub-committee members.  It also urged<br/>\nany members who could do so to come to the hearing on<br/>\nWednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no interest in re-igniting the conversation<br/>\nregarding this bill.  I am not an HSLDA member or<br/>\nadvocate.  I do know their policies and can&#39;t imagine<br/>\nhow it is possible to be an unschooler and comply with<br/>\ntheir requirements. (I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m going to stir<br/>\nup some dust with this statement.  Oh, well  ; )<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to point out that legislation, and its&#39;<br/>\nramifications, is COMPLICATED.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to acknowledge that is naive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned a lot about how the legislative process<br/>\nworks and what types of action/inaction are<br/>\nappropriate re. HS issues.  I have learned mostly by<br/>\nhanging out with those who have been in the trenches.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, my partner at SOS spends a lot of her<br/>\nonline unschool time here.  I spend mine at the<br/>\nNHEN-legislative and other legally oriented sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very easy to dismiss as unimportant what you do<br/>\nnot understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons that legislation is introduced are often<br/>\nlocally specific.  Sometimes they are specific to the<br/>\nbill sponsor alone.  Every state is different.  SC is<br/>\nnot PA or FL.  Legislation that impacts homeschoolers<br/>\nis not an ongoing threat in every session here. So ...<br/>\nwhen it does come up, paying attention is a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go into detail about why the outcome of this<br/>\nparticular situation was so important, including why<br/>\nnot having it pass or even be further considered is<br/>\nimportant to all who homeschool in this state  ...  if<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have to get ready to go to ice skating.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, hey, don&#39;t take my word for it.   Get to know the<br/>\nclimate in your state.  Research and draw your own<br/>\nconclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI simply understand that my ability to do all those<br/>\nthings- to live the life of an unschooler-  is easier<br/>\nwith less rather than more legal regulation. <br/>\nAdditional regulation = more of my time wasted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLegislatively speaking, firmly closing a door does<br/>\nmake it less likely to be opened again anytime soon. <br/>\nThe turnout on Wednesday was a display of strength and<br/>\nunity in the SC homeschool community.  That&#39;s how the<br/>\nlegislators perceived it.  It does help us maintain a<br/>\nposition of influence. As an interested party, I am<br/>\nmore than happy with the results and believe that it<br/>\nwill serve us well in the future.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt should also be noted that the proposed bill had the<br/>\npotential to impact qualification for college<br/>\nscholarships that are supposed to be coming soon as a<br/>\nresult of the recently introduced state lottery.  Not<br/>\nto mention eligibility for any/all state employment. <br/>\nI&#39;m in Columbia, the capitol.  It is the largest city<br/>\nin the state and a huge proportion of the jobs<br/>\navailable are through state government agencies<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on ...  but I think that the oft&#39; quoted<br/>\n&quot;All politics are local&quot; applies here, and most<br/>\neverywhere re. HS legislation. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo Chicken Little,<br/>\nMelinda Nolan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
