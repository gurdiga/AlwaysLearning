Even though it was not <br/>\na big deal nor was it any real amount of blood.  LOL.  And when I had Phillip <br/>\n(youngest) he (meaning Phillip) had to be bagged for a minute or so, we <br/>\nalways called it a jump start in the nursery, Jackson almost passed out <br/>\nagain.  The midwife took my big fluffy pillow and gave it to Jackson and set <br/>\nhim in the chair.  I said what about me I had the baby not him.  LOL.  It is <br/>\namazing what you can&#39;t handle when it is your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yea, for those of you that don&#39;t know Jackson is a family physician.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning something new I did NOT want to learn atall, ever","postDate":"1050343852","msgId":13578,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWMzMDJiMSQ1MDAwYzMwMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDFkMS43M2QyNTNiLjJiY2I5Nzg3QGFvbC5jb20+IDwzRTlBQjRGNi42MDIwNTAyQGZyb250aWVybmV0Lm5ldD4gPDAxOWUwMWMzMDJhZiQzODYwYjRhMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":13574,"nextInTopic":13586,"prevInTime":13577,"nextInTime":13579,"topicId":13574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have an acquaintance whose husband is a general practitioner.
