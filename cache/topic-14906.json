But maybe someone<br/>\nwould be willing to wax eloquently for me about some<br/>\nthings I have been wondering.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) What if you have a child who is a poor speller? <br/>\nUsing a Franklin speller, dictionary, asking mom<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference.  If the<br/>\npoor spelling skills bothers a child, is it ok to work<br/>\nmore deliberately on spelling?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I know a lot of skills are covered in every day<br/>\nliving, but how do you actually cover basic skills so<br/>\nthat your child doesn&#39;t have these big gaps or<br/>\nsplinter skills?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I am confused about unschooling vs. little<br/>\nschooling.  It is often hard for me to tell the<br/>\ndifference.  I am not talking about anyone on this<br/>\nlist, so please don&#39;t take offense.  But I don&#39;t get a<br/>\nsense of kids with lots of depth and breadth who are<br/>\nunschooling.  This scares me.  I know there are<br/>\nwonderful unschooling kids out there who do all kinds<br/>\nof things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I have<br/>\nmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Minninger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
