I don&#39;t know that the vast majority will be by family members that live in the home. That may have something to do w/ location. In South Eastern NE - it was the parish priest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying. Is your point that self defense is unrealistic because if it&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s going to happen and the kid is too small, or too young or living w/ the molester?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it this way - if self defense, which also teaches logical thinking, self discipline, self awareness and so much more - well, if that self defense saves Brianna in one situation - then it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying that when kids are molested in the home....nothing is done?  Are you assuming that everyone in the home is complicit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t even understand what the discussion is about. You feel I&#39;m over protective. Okay. I&#39;m over protective.<br/>\nBrianna is very confident, self-assured, intelligent....heck, she can (and does) run a business (Mudpuppies Pet Products) she works with me...and does better than many adults. She&#39;s a very good writer. a very good dancer; she&#39;s adventures, curious, thoughtful...and she can defend herself.<br/>\nLast winter, a large, hulking bully was teasing her. She handled it great. She went about her business. He teased her every time he saw her. Finally - he shoved her. She laid him out. and left the area. She came home very upset.<br/>\nThere was the time 93 years ago) she was hit in the face - by a neighborhood kid and her adult tooth was/is very badly chipped. If she had been able to defend herself - she wouldn&#39;t have gotten whacked. Now, if someone is trying to hit her - she knows the moves to avoid injury.<br/>\nIs that over-protective? I call that smart. <br/>\nIf you&#39;re comfortable w/ your 8-10 y.o daughter being alone in a mid-sized city - good for you. I&#39;m not.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: J.
