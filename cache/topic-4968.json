It was<br/>\ncheaper to make a new product while waiting to renew the patent.<br/>\n(again, according to my Mom&#39;s research)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey couldn&#39;t advertise they were in the process of renewing <br/>\ntheir patent.  It had to be hush hush so some other company <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t apply for the same patent at the same time (there was<br/>\na short period when the patent was expired and the new patent<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been granted yet),,,,who knows who&#39;s paperwork would <br/>\nhave gone through first if that happened?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is all according to what my Mom found out about<br/>\nit.  She could be totally wrong for all I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW,,,I took the Pepsi challenge several times and *always*<br/>\nchose Coke.
