A<br/>\nphilosophy<br/>\n&gt; that allows for that seems healthier to me than one that says &quot;If you felt<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; had no choice, someone wasn&#39;t working hard enough to provide you with a<br/>\n&gt; choice.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it promises something that can&#39;t really be delivered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As with most things, I wonder if the best people can do is approach<br/>\n&gt; consensual living, not accomplish it.

And it wouldn&#39;t bother me or<br/>\nfeel<br/>\n&gt; so condescending if those who assure me/us that we just don&#39;t get it would<br/>\n&gt; tell some personal stories to show that they really DO get it, and that<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really workable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s way easier to critique another&#39;s stories if it&#39;s all theoretical than<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; compare your own life to theirs and then pick apart threads and ideas and<br/>\n&gt; practices and trade successes.

Why wouldn&#39;t one choose what they <br/>\nreally want? <br/>\n<br/>\nI really want my family to have a clean house (actually I need to be <br/>\ncleaning right now! lol.) and a cooked meal and save for other things <br/>\nthan catering or a live-in cook. So I really do want to cook tonight. <br/>\nI just didn&#39;t consider my real priorities throughly. In essense, I <br/>\nchanged my mind: I do want to cook. We all can change our minds when <br/>\nwe understand our priorities and choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can choose to be happy with the choice or choose to believe we had <br/>\nno choice. But we always have a choice. Only force or coercion <br/>\nbetween people eliminates choice. Even life is a choice.

My own kids are more likely to freak out if I even start the car before they&#39;re buckled in, but they&#39;ve all resisted the carseat after age 3 or so.  The most recent version of this is that Dan wants his carseat moved to the middle of the backseat (right now they each sit at a window).  Sure, I could buckle his seat in there, but it would really crowd his brother.  What do you say when the only reason you can&#39;t comply is fairness to others?  He&#39;s never acknowledged it would be unfair to his brother -- I&#39;ve just told him I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI find my biggest challenge with consensual living is reaching a compromise when one of us wants/needs to go somewhere and others resist going along.  My kids are too young to stay home alone, and we simply don&#39;t have the income to pay a sitter (besides where would I find someone mid-day on a weekday during the schoolyear?).  It seems the more I try to convince for the activity or commitment, the more resistance I get.

Maybe just having <br/>\nthem run fast into your arm.  Then explain how they doubled over your <br/>\narm and couldn&#39;t stop their upper body from going forward.  I&#39;m assuming <br/>\na child small enough that wouldn&#39;t break your arm ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSee if it&#39;s an issue of comfort with a particular car or booster seat.  <br/>\nMaybe it can be made more comfortable.

To me it&#39;s a matter of respect, not evasion. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I find the day to day examples to often be tedious, <br/>\nself-congratulatory, and sometimes embarrassing, even painful to read.  <br/>\nSo are those who want to give all of these examples/details right and <br/>\nthose who don&#39;t wrong?    Does it mean that a discussion can&#39;t take <br/>\nplace?  And why would you assume that those who don&#39;t share all of these <br/>\ndetails in public forums mean that they don&#39;t invite people over, go to <br/>\nconferences, and mix it up?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also say about my spanking example:<br/>\nSo if it is proven to turn out better not to spank AND it&#39;s a more <br/>\nrespectful, humane, loving thing, you have<br/>\nthe theory and the results both together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m saying that the theory is enough for me.  We know that there are <br/>\npeople out there that would offer &quot;proofs&quot; that spanking IS good.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t need proof (or anecdotes from parents that say something &quot;works&quot; <br/>\nfor their family) to do the what I believe to be the respectful, humane, <br/>\nloving thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also say TCS needs to stay where it is and not mix with <br/>\nunschooling?    Gee, tell us what you really think!  Are you talking <br/>\nabout the theory or the people?  Because in the end, it&#39;s just people <br/>\nsharing ideas.   People like me who unschool and do my best (very <br/>\nimperfectly) to parent consentually.    And you may just run into me, <br/>\n&quot;mixing it up&quot; at an unschooling conference :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s not part of the theory, though.  That&#39;s part of the package.<br/>\n&gt; The mystique.  The delivery.  The &quot;ooh, we&#39;re cool&quot; part.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschoolers are rarely mysterious.  They&#39;re out there helping people all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of ways, and telling stories and inviting people over and going to<br/>\n&gt; conferences and mixing it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the other part about  giving details has to do with the idea of not<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; needing to prove anything.  Do we not spank our kids because it would be<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrong to spank, or because we think spanking will make them turn out the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrong way (angry, abusers, timid, whatever)? -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it turned out not spanking kids DID create axe murders (or <br/>\n&gt; whatever) then<br/>\n&gt; spanking would be good.  But it turns out it&#39;s quite the other way <br/>\n&gt; around. <br/>\n&gt; People in prison report some horrendous abuses.  So if it is proven to <br/>\n&gt; turn out<br/>\n&gt; better not to spank AND it&#39;s a more respectful, humane, loving thing, <br/>\n&gt; you have<br/>\n&gt; the theory and the results both together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-So I think that TCS argues that there is an objective search for<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; truth (not that we know what it is, but that we&#39;re always seeking) and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that it has nothing to do with what &quot;works&quot; the best.  -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe so.  But if so, it  needs to stay where it is and not mix with<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, because unschooling help can&#39;t help but involve itself <br/>\n&gt; with reality and<br/>\n&gt; what works well for children and for families.  It&#39;s not a political <br/>\n&gt; statement.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a way of helping children learn and grow without school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- I did not mean to say that what people<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; said to you on lists were not responses. -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You are sayig they&#39;re not TCS responses, but they were clearly <br/>\n&gt; indicated as<br/>\n&gt; such.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- In any case, I know that there are a few people on the TCS list<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; who have a non-confrontational, helpful style (in my opinion anyway).  -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For my tastes, confrontation is better than evasion.<br/>\n&gt; Anecdote is better than theory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess interested people could just go to google and put in<br/>\n&gt; TCS Taking Children Seriously<br/>\n&gt; and read what they find, though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\n$0 Web Hosting with up to 120MB web space, 1000 MB Data Transfer<br/>\n10 Personalized POP and Web E-mail Accounts, and much more.<br/>\nGet It Now At www.doteasy.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TCS & seat belts was Sandra&#39;s book","postDate":"1090631704","msgId":20054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzI0MDExNTA0Ljg5OTc1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxMDFBRUZBLjMwNzA0MDdAa2F0dGxlci1nb2xkLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":20053,"nextInTopic":20055,"prevInTime":20053,"nextInTime":20055,"topicId":20028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Then what is there to discuss?

It does not assume that it is a <br/>\nparenting method. It attempts to indicate the obsticles to effective <br/>\nlearning. It does not object to coercion in the face of danger, but <br/>\nit does indicate how coercive actions can interfere with learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany responders on the site are not as creative as others at problem <br/>\nsolving. Neither am I, or other individuals in my family, ALL THE <br/>\nTIME. But that doesn&#39;t mean that we are not learning to find common <br/>\nsolutions through trial and error. However, on the rare occasions <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t find a common preference it does not mean that there <br/>\nwasn&#39;t one available. We just did not find it. Not finding a common <br/>\npreference indicates that we resigned ourselves to coercion. Someone <br/>\nhaving to do something that they did not want to do IS damaging to <br/>\nthe process of learning that consensual living can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile learning other information (such as math or drawing or <br/>\ncooking,etc), the learning can similarly be damaged by having to do <br/>\nsomething that one does not want to do. Learning is an active <br/>\nprocess. If one has no choice but to do something they are learning <br/>\nthat sometimes force can be used. We learn by participation. There is <br/>\nan old German saying: one convinced against his will, is of the same <br/>\nopinion still.<br/>\n<br/>\nTCS is a philosophy of learning. The process of learning can <br/>\nperpetuate the idea that force can be used or not. TCS is a process <br/>\nof interacting with children so that they can learn that consensual <br/>\nliving does exist. The use of coercion damages this life lesson. <br/>\nLiving without the alternative of force enhances problem solving. <br/>\nEvery problem is new. Every solution is unique. These problem-solving <br/>\nlessons are damaged by coercion. Coercion eliminates possible <br/>\nsolutions. So no one solution is THE solution for car seats or <br/>\nbedtimes or whatever. There are an infinite number of creative <br/>\npossibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is actually just a rudimentary aspect of consensual <br/>\nliving.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is another facet of learning about life. Consensual <br/>\nliving is a philosophy of living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like a group of people who are more globally interested in <br/>\ndiscussing the philosophy of consensual living. The arenas of <br/>\nconsensual living include politics, economics, family, relationships, <br/>\nand education, etc. As we embrace consensual living as a philosophy, <br/>\nit makes life learning so much easier to conceptualize and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Several of my friends strongly dislike the format of TCS&#39;s <br/>\npreaching due to the harshness and negativity associated with failing <br/>\nto be creative. Ironically, this &quot;failure&quot; attitude of TCS&#39;s site <br/>\nobstructs learning about consensual living itself. But the TCS site <br/>\ndoes state that the site responders are fallable.

And I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure what the answer is.  I know there are people on the TCS list <br/>\nthat could argue forcefully about why but I&#39;ve never been completely <br/>\nclear.   I do believe in protecting other people&#39;s privacy.  So I try <br/>\nnot to talk about people that I know on email lists.  I do it in person <br/>\nbut I wish I did it less.

But on an email list, I think we can discuss it more <br/>\nobjectively and less personally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other part about  giving details has to do with the idea of not <br/>\nneeding to prove anything.  Do we not spank our kids because it would be <br/>\nwrong to spank, or because we think spanking will make them turn out the <br/>\nwrong way (angry, abusers, timid, whatever)?  We may have an opinion <br/>\nabout the second, but I think the reason we don&#39;t is because it&#39;s <br/>\nwrong.  So I think that TCS argues that there is an objective search for <br/>\ntruth (not that we know what it is, but that we&#39;re always seeking) and <br/>\nthat it has nothing to do with what &quot;works&quot; the best.

Sure, TCS proponents have ideas about how to <br/>\nhandle situations, but my point is that the only one that matters is the <br/>\ncommon preference you find between the parties involved in the <br/>\nsituation.  The people on the outside (TCS or otherwise) could be <br/>\nwrong.  But you knew that :-)  I did not mean to say that what people <br/>\nsaid to you on lists were not responses. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Maybe that means stopping at a fun place on the way home, or<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; having certain games in the car or whatever.

Most <br/>\nTCS discussions (on the TCS list) I&#39;ve paid attention to (and I  ignore <br/>\na lot of them) have people arguing different points of view.  Of course <br/>\nthere are those on the list expressly to criticize the whole theory.  <br/>\nBut I mean even among those who consider themselves TCS.   So I guess <br/>\nsome &quot;TCS&quot; folks would consider that coercion but many would not.  Many <br/>\nwould view it as a creative way to solve a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- That has a different feel to it in my opinion.

I meant the characterization of TCS.  I was <br/>\ntrying to convey my different understanding of the theories than how you <br/>\nwere describing them.

If people use TCS as an excuse to not communicate with<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; or know their children, then I&#39;d say they don&#39;t understand it yet.  -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe so.<br/>\n&gt; But unless TCS eliminates those without social skills (as I suggested <br/>\n&gt; helps<br/>\n&gt; keep the quality of monasteries high, and keep the peace there), they <br/>\n&gt; will have<br/>\n&gt; to accept that their theory (understood or not) can be used as a<br/>\n&gt; justification and a shield by those who weren&#39;t going to communicate <br/>\n&gt; well with children<br/>\n&gt; anyway, so they are happy to find a group saying &quot;let them do what <br/>\n&gt; they want to<br/>\n&gt; do; anything less is a violation of their rights.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That may be true but since TCS is not a religion and doesn&#39;t ask for a <br/>\nstatement of faith it would be hard to keep anyone from calling <br/>\nthemselves TCS.

The address is <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:common-preference-parenting@yahoogroups.com\">common-preference-parenting@yahoogroups.com</a>  if anyone wants to join and <br/>\nask questions.  Maybe we can get a conversation going.  There are many <br/>\nTCS sublists (with TCS in the title) but all seem to be very quiet right <br/>\nnow.   In any case, I know that there are a few people on the TCS list <br/>\nwho have a non-confrontational, helpful style (in my opinion anyway).  <br/>\nBut I&#39;ve also learned to listen to the argument without taking it <br/>\npersonally.  It wasn&#39;t easy at first.  The first TCS discussion I was on <br/>\nscared me to death.  It was mostly the non-TCS folks that got <br/>\nparticularly nasty but still the confrontation was very scary for me.  <br/>\nIn any case, these people who I think are very helpful also are on the <br/>\nCPP list so perhaps that&#39;s a place to start. <br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\n$0 Web Hosting with up to 120MB web space, 1000 MB Data Transfer<br/>\n10 Personalized POP and Web E-mail Accounts, and much more.<br/>\nGet It Now At www.doteasy.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Changing subject headings","postDate":"1090605187","msgId":20045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMy4yNWQyZTBlYi4yZTMyYWE4M0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20044,"nextInTopic":20047,"prevInTime":20044,"nextInTime":20046,"topicId":20028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/23/04 11:51:20 AM, debra@kattler-gold.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-181494026\">In a message dated 7/23/04 11:51:20 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra@...\">debra@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Perhaps that should have been your subject heading rather than using the <br/>\n<br/>\nprevious one.

The only outcome, I suppose, it that your <br/>\nchildren will have the life that they want.  Not that they will turn out <br/>\na certain way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; But one complaint I have with kids who are &quot;out of hand&quot; (to use a <br/>\n&gt; telling<br/>\n&gt; common phrase, and I&#39;ll get back to that) is when the parents seem <br/>\n&gt; entirely<br/>\n&gt; unaware that things aren&#39;t going smoothly.   And my preference in <br/>\n&gt; cases where<br/>\n&gt; things are going bad and my children or my possessions are suffering <br/>\n&gt; because of<br/>\n&gt; the choices and actions of someone else&#39;s kids is that the parents <br/>\n&gt; would try to<br/>\n&gt; persuade them, reason with them, remind them to share, to lighten up, <br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; considerate. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In discussions in AOL&#39;s unschooling area years ago, which is where I <br/>\n&gt; and some<br/>\n&gt; others here were first confronted with TCS&#39;s bold assurances that we <br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; doing it right with our kids, it was made clear that compromise is NOT <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; goal, compromise is telling a child he can&#39;t have his way.  It was <br/>\n&gt; made clear<br/>\n&gt; that persuasion is coercion and manipulation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So &quot;manipulation&quot; leads back to &quot;out of hand.&quot;   &quot;Manipulation&quot; literally<br/>\n&gt; means to move something or someone around with your hands.  And &quot;out <br/>\n&gt; of hand&quot;<br/>\n&gt; means off the leash/lead/reins, or out of reach of one&#39;s hand (as with <br/>\n&gt; a horse,<br/>\n&gt; dog, child).  So &quot;out of hand&quot; might seem good and right to a TCS <br/>\n&gt; promoter. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In its literal, philosophical, sense anyway.    My kids might be &quot;out of<br/>\n&gt; hand&quot; (I don&#39;t control their moves) but they are not out of <br/>\n&gt; conscience.  They<br/>\n&gt; feel responsibility for their own actions, and I feel secondary <br/>\n&gt; responsibility. <br/>\n&gt; If my mothering (or my genetic input) resulted in difficult children,  I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t just throw up my hands and say &quot;Gosh, what can I do?  There&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; nothing can<br/>\n&gt; be done within my philosophy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, this is not an accurate description of the theory.  According to <br/>\nTCS, one should share their theories and morality with their children.  <br/>\nNot impose it, but certainly share it.  There is no such thing as <br/>\nthrowing up your hands and saying&quot; nothing can be done within my <br/>\nphilosophy.&quot;  That would be the antithesis of TCS which says that a <br/>\nsolution can always be found (or certainly that one should always be <br/>\nsought). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf children are &quot;out of hand&quot; as you say, and their parents are <br/>\ncompletely unaware, then this is not really TCS as it is proposed <br/>\neither.  This is more laissez faire.  TCS parents try to be very hands <br/>\non and help their children with conflicts and difficult situations.  Of <br/>\ncourse, as you say elsewhere, theory is fine until you involve people <br/>\n:-)  TCS parents do not necessarily implement TCS theory flawlessly <br/>\n;-).   So sometimes laissez faire will slip in instead of coercion, when <br/>\nbeing hands on would have been better.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One mom in the big AOL-homeschooling days was writing lots and  <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; tell us whether she had children, how many, how old.  &quot;Irrelevant,&quot; <br/>\n&gt; she said.<br/>\n&gt; Just believe the philosophy for its own sake.   Y&#39;know, though, lots of<br/>\n&gt; philosophies work VERY well in the theoretical stage.  Communism is <br/>\n&gt; one.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just the addition of actual humans that makes it fall apart.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, here&#39;s where you say the part about adding people to the <br/>\nimplementation of the theory.  But saying it is irrelevant whether one <br/>\nis a parent or not really speaks to the issue of relying on &quot;experts.&quot;  <br/>\nAre you saying that only parents can have an opinion about parenting?  <br/>\nIf one can only comment on something because they have experience or are <br/>\nexpert in that area, then we could say that you can only comment on the <br/>\nproblems of teens if you have one, or on Communism if you&#39;ve lived in a <br/>\ncommunist country.  TCS proponents argue that one can have an opinion <br/>\nbased on a philosophy without having experienced every situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some monastic<br/>\n&gt; systems work pretty well (Buddhist and Christian), but they work well by<br/>\n&gt; elimination of disruptive elements.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know?  Do you practice one of these systems ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So as a philosophy, it would need to start, I think, with &quot;Given an ideal<br/>\n&gt; parent and an ideal child...&quot;   And maybe those families in which it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; working<br/>\n&gt; well, that IS the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Backwards.  If we were all ideal, then maybe we wouldn&#39;t even need <br/>\nphilosophy or theories.  Everything would already be ideal!   TCS at its <br/>\ncore is about finding solutions to problems and about acknowledging our <br/>\nfallibility.  It has nothing to do with being perfect. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  One classic argument that comes up is<br/>\n&gt; seatbelts.

There are ideas to try but the only correct <br/>\nTCS response is the common preference that you work out with your child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just reported truthfully that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not above bribery, and was kinda blasted for being clearly coercive.  But<br/>\n&gt; &quot;coercive&quot; in their lingo is defined even to asking nicely, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think TCS people are all about being nice to your children.  So I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure where asking nicely is not ok.  Parents also have needs that <br/>\nneed to be taken into account.  So a parent might say that they want to <br/>\nget something done so they want to find a way to make it pleasant for <br/>\neveryone.  Maybe that means stopping at a fun place on the way home, or <br/>\nhaving certain games in the car or whatever.  I think where TCS and what <br/>\nyou are saying part ways is in the idea that one would use bribery in <br/>\nthe sense that the child could only get the pleasant thing if they do <br/>\nsomething a certain way.  Realistically of course, if one is going to <br/>\nstop for ice cream on the way home and there is no ice cream in the <br/>\nhouse, then one would most likely need to get in the car to get the ice <br/>\ncream.  So one could view it as bribery but if the child could have some <br/>\nother goodie that you do have in the house without leaving, then it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be bribery, just an idea to try.  In other words, it would be <br/>\nbribery to say you can only have a sweet if you come with me.  But to <br/>\nsay, come on let&#39;s go get this thing done and then we&#39;ll go have some <br/>\nfun.  That has a different feel to it in my opinion.  So again, I have <br/>\nto take issue with your characterization.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And my conclusion after years of reading bits of it here and there, <br/>\n&gt; and lumps<br/>\n&gt; of it (there are a couple of full workshop things online, and one I read<br/>\n&gt; lately), is that it&#39;s a way that some people who are lacking in <br/>\n&gt; interpersonal<br/>\n&gt; skills justify not even trying to communicate with or know their <br/>\n&gt; children.  They<br/>\n&gt; say &quot;Well, it&#39;s a violation of their space and personhood and that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; why I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t.&quot;  I think maybe some of them don&#39;t have the ability to <br/>\n&gt; communicate well<br/>\n&gt; with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, not TCS.  If people use TCS as an excuse to not communicate with <br/>\nor know their children, then I&#39;d say they don&#39;t understand it yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\n$0 Web Hosting with up to 120MB web space, 1000 MB Data Transfer<br/>\n10 Personalized POP and Web E-mail Accounts, and much more.<br/>\nGet It Now At www.doteasy.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"was &quot;Hello everyone!&quot;  (now, Sandra writes a damned book)","postDate":"1090593564","msgId":20028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4LjQxZDIwNTk3LjJlMzI3ZDFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20032,"prevInTime":20027,"nextInTime":20029,"topicId":20028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/23/04 6:51:56 AM, tuckervill2@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-968874367\">In a message dated 7/23/04 6:51:56 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The reason they won&#39;t use real-life examples is because they think it&#39;s  <br/>\nwrong to talk about their own children.  It IS part of the philosophy to  not <br/>\nuse <br/>\nreal-life examples.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think Sandra is going to want to talk about TCS here, though. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind talking about it, but I can&#39;t be as supportive as some people <br/>\nmight like me to be.     It&#39;s not that it&#39;s a bad idea, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an idea <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t allow examination in the form in which the main proponents present <br/>\nit.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be like announcing the reason for an experiment, saying it&#39;s <br/>\nsuccessful, and then not showing any data.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard bad reports from a couple of people who met families whose main <br/>\nphilosophy was TCS and who had bad visits and never wanted to visit again.    <br/>\nThat can happen with families of ALL kinds, really.  Kids don&#39;t hit it off, bad <br/>\nday for those kids, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one complaint I have with kids who are &quot;out of hand&quot; (to use a telling <br/>\ncommon phrase, and I&#39;ll get back to that) is when the parents seem entirely <br/>\nunaware that things aren&#39;t going smoothly.   And my preference in cases where <br/>\nthings are going bad and my children or my possessions are suffering because of <br/>\nthe choices and actions of someone else&#39;s kids is that the parents would try to <br/>\npersuade them, reason with them, remind them to share, to lighten up, to be <br/>\nconsiderate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn discussions in AOL&#39;s unschooling area years ago, which is where I and some <br/>\nothers here were first confronted with TCS&#39;s bold assurances that we weren&#39;t <br/>\ndoing it right with our kids, it was made clear that compromise is NOT the <br/>\ngoal, compromise is telling a child he can&#39;t have his way.  It was made clear <br/>\nthat persuasion is coercion and manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo &quot;manipulation&quot; leads back to &quot;out of hand.&quot;   &quot;Manipulation&quot; literally <br/>\nmeans to move something or someone around with your hands.  And &quot;out of hand&quot; <br/>\nmeans off the leash/lead/reins, or out of reach of one&#39;s hand (as with a horse, <br/>\ndog, child).  So &quot;out of hand&quot; might seem good and right to a TCS promoter. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n In its literal, philosophical, sense anyway.    My kids might be &quot;out of <br/>\nhand&quot; (I don&#39;t control their moves) but they are not out of conscience.  They <br/>\nfeel responsibility for their own actions, and I feel secondary responsibility.  <br/>\nIf my mothering (or my genetic input) resulted in difficult children,  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t just throw up my hands and say &quot;Gosh, what can I do?  There&#39;s nothing can <br/>\nbe done within my philosophy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mom in the big AOL-homeschooling days was writing lots and  wouldn&#39;t even <br/>\ntell us whether she had children, how many, how old.  &quot;Irrelevant,&quot; she said. <br/>\n Just believe the philosophy for its own sake.   Y&#39;know, though, lots of <br/>\nphilosophies work VERY well in the theoretical stage.  Communism is one.  It&#39;s <br/>\njust the addition of actual humans that makes it fall apart.  Some monastic <br/>\nsystems work pretty well (Buddhist and Christian), but they work well by <br/>\nelimination of disruptive elements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as a philosophy, it would need to start, I think, with &quot;Given an ideal <br/>\nparent and an ideal child...&quot;   And maybe those families in which it&#39;s working <br/>\nwell, that IS the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo families whose moms adopted TCS later on were families with LOTS of kids, <br/>\nand both started off fundamentalist Christian, but moved away from that and <br/>\nmoved toward TCS.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think in both situations because the moms were bright and loving and <br/>\ninvolved, and because the children were already VERY &quot;in hand&quot; that letting them <br/>\nmake choices from that point was a luxurious bonus round to an <br/>\nalready-unschooling life.  It probably did seem the other swing of the pendelum.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for those who begin more in the middle, not at an extreme edge, the <br/>\narguments about coercion seem less crucial.  One classic argument that comes up is <br/>\nseatbelts.  The TYC response seemed to be if the kid doesn&#39;t want to go in the <br/>\nseatbelt, you just can&#39;t make the trip.   I just reported truthfully that I&#39;m <br/>\nnot above bribery, and was kinda blasted for being clearly coercive.  But <br/>\n&quot;coercive&quot; in their lingo is defined even to asking nicely, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother conversation that just about did it permanently for me was whether a <br/>\nkid could walk on a coffee table.    A toddler, wanting to walk on a table.  I <br/>\nhave two ratty coffee tables and I don&#39;t mind if kids dance on them.  BUT... <br/>\nin the discussion, I said it&#39;s up to the owner of the coffee table.   That <br/>\nseems clear to me.   But what wasn&#39;t clear from the TCS end was that it has other <br/>\npolitical overtones, and the conferences at which it&#39;s presented are <br/>\nlibertarian and related conferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think another person&#39;s liberty ends where my coffeetable begins.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since I&#39;m more likely to let a kid walk on a coffeetable whose mother <br/>\nwould have totally forbidden it had she been there, I just cannot get worked up <br/>\nto look more deeply into something it seems even the proponents haven&#39;t <br/>\nexamined.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my conclusion after years of reading bits of it here and there, and lumps <br/>\nof it (there are a couple of full workshop things online, and one I read <br/>\nlately), is that it&#39;s a way that some people who are lacking in interpersonal <br/>\nskills justify not even trying to communicate with or know their children.  They <br/>\nsay &quot;Well, it&#39;s a violation of their space and personhood and that&#39;s why I <br/>\ndon&#39;t.&quot;  I think maybe some of them don&#39;t have the ability to communicate well <br/>\nwith others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat Howard Gardner stuff shed light on a lot of memories in my life, <br/>\nhonestly.  Looking back at the world through the lens of multiple intelligence <br/>\ntheory, I had a little festival of &quot;OH!  No WONDER!&quot; about lots of unsolved <br/>\nmysteries in my past, with friends and relatives and schoolmates and those who taught <br/>\nwith me and people&#39;s reactions to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s EASY for someone to assume the rest of the world is like they are.  It&#39;s <br/>\ncomforting.  It&#39;s not true, though.   Another unschooling mom was over here <br/>\nnot long ago, and she was vehemently against jocks/sports.   Her derision was <br/>\nthick.  It was STUPID.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be that way, because I didn&#39;t understand it, and because I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nathletic, and because school had taught me that what&#39;s really important is <br/>\nwriting and reading, not glorified recess.    Because we played kickball and <br/>\ndodgeball at recess, and because school is as school is, I saw sports as <br/>\nover-glorifed P.E. (a very UNDERglorified class).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was my own prejudice and ignorance, and I&#39;m glad I got over it.  By my <br/>\nmid-20&#39;s I was looking at people without knowing their school records, whether <br/>\nthey were &quot;good students&quot; or not, and I started seeing the beauty and skill <br/>\ninvolved in soccer, skiing (I wasn&#39;t DOING those things, but watching <br/>\nboyfriends, best friends and other buddies do them with extreme grace, speed, amazing <br/>\nskill), and then I joined the SCA and saw that even make-believe sword fighting <br/>\nwas something with depth and beauty and I couldn&#39;t begin to do it, so I&#39;d <br/>\nbetter shut up about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGardner says interpersonal intelligence is as real as verbal or mathematical <br/>\nor kinestheti or spatial.   I believe him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people who don&#39;t have any can seem just as derisive of those who do as I <br/>\nwas about jocks, when I was a teenager.  They were &quot;stupid&quot; because I didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand what they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can persuade my children (and my friends, and other people) to think <br/>\nabout why they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing, and to consider doing what will make <br/>\nthem and others feel better, that is just friendship, just parenting, just <br/>\ndiscussion, in my life.  To others who can&#39;t do it, it&#39;s coercion and <br/>\nmanipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be wrong, but that&#39;s my theory about it this year.<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20197,"nextTopicId":20117}}
