As a SAHM","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1229129565\">If someone told you that there is gold buried in your backyard, would <br/>\nyou believe them? Of course not, but I am sure glad I decided to <br/>\ncheck it out! As a SAHM of 5 making ends meet is the eternal <br/>\nstruggle! I have tried a multitude of different savings programs all <br/>\nof which amounted to a waste of my time. During a gymboree class, I <br/>\nwas discussing the high cost of everything with another couple who <br/>\nhave 7 children. They told me about this program at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wrldofproducts.com\">http://www.wrldofproducts.com</a> that allows you to choose the coupons <br/>\nyou want for the products that you already use. My husband and I <br/>\nthought it was very interesting and decided to try it. About 4 days <br/>\nafter signing on to the program I received my kit in the mail. On <br/>\n1/25/03, we went shopping at our local Publix Supermarket. I bought <br/>\nall the items that I normally buy the difference this time was that I <br/>\nhad a coupon for every item that I purchased. The cashier rang up our <br/>\norder and it came to $327.87 then I presented her with the coupons <br/>\nthat I received through this program and I saved $ 303.79! All I had <br/>\nto pay was $24.08! The cashier was so shocked that she said, I <br/>\nthought we were going to have to pay you. I was practically <br/>\nspeechless. This program is the best thing I have ever witnessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: The company also has 68,000 items at below wholesale prices. It&#39;s <br/>\namazing!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12119,"nextTopicId":12199}}
