I have seen a shift in my ideas and believes in true education since graduating from college with a teaching degree.  Both of my teens have their own passions in life and are struggling with societies requirements for high school and college.  I feel like I am holding them back if I require them to complete certain course work that they are not interested in as well as feel they are not going to use with their passion. I have given them more control of their education this year but haven&#39;t jumped into unschooling yet.  My daughter doesn&#39;t want to go to college because of the debt and time commitment of 4 years. We have looked into College Plus as a way to get her degree instead of the traditional way.  She really wants to write songs, produce an album and sing on tour all over the world. She completed a kickstarter fundraiser to help raise money for recording her first album of her original songs.  She has started recording and wants to work part time. My son has a passion for musical theatre and has a bucket list several pages long.  He has planned a bike trip across our state this summer to raise $ for water in Africa. I just need some advice on how to transition from homeschooling high school to unschooling so that my teens can pursue their passions.  I am so blessed to have two teens with passion at their ages.  I know that I need to change the most to make this transition and change what I require from them but I just don&#39;t know how to make this work because I am in one of the most regulated homeschool state in the US. Any suggestions and advice is appreciated. Thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70552,"nextTopicId":70589}}
