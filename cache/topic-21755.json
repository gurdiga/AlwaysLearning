(Thanks!)<br/>\n*************************************************<br/>\n          The &quot;OCTA-TETRA Construction Set&quot; is a hands-on, low-tech, <br/>\ngeometric construction set teaching 3-D geometry, design principles, <br/>\nthe discovery process, manual dexterity, and more and more.  It is <br/>\ndesigned for kids of about 10-11 years old and on upwards.<br/>\n       First visit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyclassroom.net/hsboys/articles/octa-\">http://familyclassroom.net/hsboys/articles/octa-</a><br/>\ntetra.html for an introduction to &quot;The OCTA-TETRA Club&quot;.  This page <br/>\nwas made over two years ago; the project has progressed by light-<br/>\nyears since then.<br/>\n<br/>\n The OCTA-TETRA Club  Update - June 2004<br/>\n       I have made major breakthroughs with the OCTA-TETRA <br/>\nConstruction Set.  The &quot;bugs&quot; are now taken out of it, and I have <br/>\nbuilt some amazing and beautiful structures.  After years <br/>\nof &quot;Research and Development&quot;, I&#39;m finally ready to &quot;go public&quot;.<br/>\n      OCTA-TETRA recently made its official debut at the &quot;Rethinking <br/>\nEducation Conference&quot; in Dallas on May 28-31 where I had been invited <br/>\nto exhibit both my &quot;Uncle Dan&#39;s Algebra Videos&quot; and the &quot;OCTA-TETRA <br/>\nConstruction Set&quot;.  Hundreds saw the spectacular OCTA-TETRA <br/>\ndemonstration model as it developed there in the lobby of the Harvey <br/>\nHotel in Irving, Texas.  One after another, first they said, &quot;Wow!&quot;, <br/>\nand then after a closer look they said, &quot;Cool!&quot;<br/>\n     The &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; is now finished through Section 19.  I <br/>\nam happy to send it out to anyone for free by e-mail attachment a <br/>\nsection at a time.  It&#39;s so much more than just an instruction <br/>\nbooklet.  You get to come along with me as I proceed by trial and <br/>\nerror, finding out what will work or not work, making the impossible <br/>\nto be possible.  Who would think one could make cutting-edge <br/>\ndiscoveries in today&#39;s hi-tech world using only paper and paper <br/>\nclips?  <br/>\n      If you would like to receive for Free the &quot;Instruction <br/>\nBooklet&quot;, just e-mail me at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:uncledan@...\">uncledan@...</a> and <br/>\nrequest that I begin to send you the &quot;OCTA-TETRA Instruction Booklet&quot; <br/>\nfiles.  If you would like to see pictures of the &quot;demonstration <br/>\nmodel&quot;, ask for that too.  Of course, if you just see the demo pics, <br/>\nand don&#39;t read the &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot;, you&#39;ll be putting the &quot;cart <br/>\nbefore the horse&quot; and missing out on the journey of discovery.  <br/>\n      I am buying the &quot;Accu-cut&quot; die-cutting machine to make pre-cut <br/>\nand pre-scored pieces available soon, hopefully in early July.  <br/>\nPlease let me know if you think you might be interested in eventually <br/>\nordering pieces.  Sections 17 and 18 of the &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; are <br/>\nthe &quot;Catalog and Price List&quot; and explain exactly how much the pieces <br/>\nwill cost, and make recommendations about how many are needed to <br/>\nbuild particular projects, and what would be needed for a &quot;starter <br/>\nset&quot; on up to a &quot;super-duper builder set&quot;.<br/>\n             Hope to hear back from you soon,<br/>\n             Dan<br/>\n<br/>\nUPDATE - July 15, 2004:  &quot;Grand Opening&quot;  pieces NOW available for <br/>\nordering, but you need &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; first, at least through <br/>\nSection 21.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21570,"nextTopicId":20449}}
