A mother of a colicky firstborn<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know whether she&#39;s going to put that child in school. But<br/>\none way or the other, if love, attachment and holding don&#39;t &quot;solve<br/>\nit,&quot; do they make it better? Do they help create a relationship for<br/>\nthe during and after that? Is love better than anger? Is attachment<br/>\nbetter than putting him in a crib and setting the alarm for morning<br/>\nfeeding time? Is holding better than ignoring?*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLogan cried  a lot, and was terribly gassy until almost 6 months.<br/>\nMy husband and I carried him constantly, he nursed, (and still does),  <br/>\nand he slept with us, (still does).<br/>\nNone of this stopped him from crying, neither of us were raised this  <br/>\nway,<br/>\nbut our instincts told us to keep him close all the time.<br/>\nNow we have a sweet, affectionate little boy who knows that mom and dad<br/>\nare in his corner whether he is smiling and happy, or melting down and  <br/>\nangry.<br/>\nThe point is, attachment parenting has already taught him trust.<br/>\nThis led us to the concept of unschooling.<br/>\nWe want him to continue to trust and have choices, and frankly, I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe sending him to school will further those goals.<br/>\nI met an adult who had been unschooled about a year ago. and then I  <br/>\nread John Holt.<br/>\nI am so grateful for this group because I do feel like we are heading  <br/>\ninto unchartered, but exciting waters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39981,"nextTopicId":39957}}
