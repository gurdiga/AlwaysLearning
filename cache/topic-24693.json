This was her 5th C-section and<br/>\nafter the baby was born some of the amniotic fluid got into Missey&#39;s<br/>\nbloodstream and caused a blod clot which took her life.  She leaves<br/>\nbehind a heartbroken husband and 5 children ages, 10, 8, 5, 2, and 2<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew Missey through a couple different homeschooling message<br/>\nboards and Yahoo groups we were both members of.  She was a precious<br/>\nlady full of homeschooling wisdom.  She mentored many of us and now<br/>\nministers to all in how we should never take any day with our<br/>\nfamilies for granted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no life insurance on Missey, so the expenses are going to<br/>\nbe big for the family.  A fund has been set up for anyone willing to<br/>\nhelp the family out.  You can read about Missey and the fund here...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolblogger.com/HSBCompanyBlog/93238/\">http://www.homeschoolblogger.com/HSBCompanyBlog/93238/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMissey had a blog here... www.homeschoolblogger.com/Heartschooling ,<br/>\nwith her last entry being the morning of the day she died.  She also<br/>\nstarted a Yahoo group called Basically Beechick.

And<br/>\nthe thing I&#39;ll remember the most about Missey is that she started<br/>\nanother Yahoo group titled RAKmoms where moms could bless other moms<br/>\nwith things they just wanted to give away free of charge to whomever<br/>\ncould use them.
