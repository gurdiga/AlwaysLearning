Will your state board of education send officials to your home if your kids do not make a certain score?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy local public elementary school begins preparing students for the standardized tests about 2 months before the test date.  I was floored.  My youngest daughter happened to be in school at that time and she said it was all they talked about in class.  The school sent home worksheets and online links to practice for the test.  My dd didn&#39;t want to do them.  No one asked about that practice.  She took the test and said it was really no big deal and was fairly stupid.  It did have some questions she didn&#39;t know because she hadn&#39;t studied those topics.  The teacher told me Allie did fine.  And that was it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are unschoolers learning on a similar curve as others?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I certainly hope not.  Well, I know my children are learning at home and schooled kids are learning/being schooled in school, but I have absolutely no desire to keep up with the school&#39;s scope & sequence.  I know homeschoolers like me who just don&#39;t really care how my children compare to other kids.  The scores are absolutely meaningless because I will not teach to the test either to prepare for the test or to strengthen weak points found by the results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I include ACT and SAT on that list, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Taking standardized tests in K - 12 is completely different than taking the SAT and ACT tests to meet college requirements.  The former is mandatory and the latter voluntary.  My 17 year old dd chose to take the SAT next month to see how well she can do.  There are workbooks full of tips, strategies, and practice questions that will prepare her for these tests.  I do not believe schoolers have an advantage over unschoolers, mostly because I think when an unschooler chooses to take these tests, or do anything else for that matter, he/she is making an informed personal decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and Standardized testing","postDate":"1253506248","msgId":47496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEREMzhENTNDLTg5NjItNDIyQy04OTI1LTlDRTNEMDczOTA5MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5NnNmbCs3bTkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5NnNmbCs3bTkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47492,"nextInTopic":47500,"prevInTime":47495,"nextInTime":47497,"topicId":47472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I guess my question is a bit of Do unschoolers test well on standardized tests, even though they aren t beaten with the specific information the way public","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-159109066\">-=-I guess my question is a bit of &quot;Do unschoolers test well on  <br/>\nstandardized tests, even though they aren&#39;t beaten with the specific  <br/>\ninformation the way public schoolers are?&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell lots of public schooled kids do horribly on the tests, even those  <br/>\nwho know the material somewhat, because some people don&#39;t test well.<br/>\nOthers are great guessers and can pass tests on things they know  <br/>\nlittle to nothing about because they can spot the bad answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are statistics on the scores of homeschoolers, but there aren&#39;t  <br/>\nstats on unschoolers&#39; scores separately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the days when New Mexico required three tests over the school  <br/>\nyears, some parents would register the kid for third grade twice, and  <br/>\nthen skip to fifth (when 4th grade was one of the testing years, for  <br/>\nexample).

Because I don&#39;t want to involve certificated teachers in our lives, we choose to be in compliance with our laws by using the standardized tests.  (Generally, we&#39;ve used the CAT-Survey available from Seton Hall, so the scores are sent only to us).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not prepare for the tests.  We use the test that corresponds with the age-grade that our children would be in were they in school (age minus 5).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe generally stick the scores away in the file cabinet when they come in, and sometimes don&#39;t bother to open them.  We&#39;re required to test, not to submit scores, or pay any attention to them.  So that&#39;s what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriousity got the best of me the first few years, so I snuck a peek.  I&#39;m sometimes really surprised that they score so well, and I&#39;m often surprised when they &quot;clean up&quot; on subjects I didn&#39;t think they knew anything about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In our state we are required to have the kids take a standardized test every other year (3, 5, 7,9, and 11).  This is our year (first time) and I&#39;m a bit nervous for them.  I&#39;m wondering if I need to take a few weeks to teach my kids how to take a test, to make sure they know how to fill in a bubble and how to differentiate between a #2 and a #3 pencil (rolling my eyes).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you had your kids take a standardized test?  How did they do?  Did you prepare ahead of time.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TIA for suggestions on how to relax through this process.  It&#39;s difficult enough to remain calm when I get put through the ringer about my schooling choice.
