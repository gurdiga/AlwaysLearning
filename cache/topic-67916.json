They like Fairly Odd Parents, and have seen every single episode, but like watching them again anyway. Because I&#39;ve watched the show with them a bunch, I can still talk to them about it, but I take that time to do the cleaning I need to do to keep our house functional and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that I&#39;ve redefined what &quot;functional&quot; looks like, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deep cleaning--the diligent dog hair removal and tile scrubbing and mopping and wood polishing--gets done much less frequently than it would if I didn&#39;t have kids. But like someone else said, I do get to that for company, usually by my husband taking them to the movies for the afternoon or the city pool or something like that that takes a couple of hours or more.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce has a really sweet section on her site about happily sharing cleaning with her kids. Maybe it could work to include the kids in certain parts. It takes longer than it would if it were just you zipping through it, but it could be fun and positive for all of you. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a> My kids love the vinegar/water squirt bottles, and once I gut the bathroom in anticipation of a good cleaning, it&#39;s actually helpful for them to go to town squirting the mirrors, shower, sink, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, would it be helpful to make your big house smaller? Could you consolidate the fun stuff into a couple of rooms?

That&#39;s simple. If the kids are inside a lot, tidy up here and there where they like to play. You can make it something you do while hanging out in the same room, something you do while looking for lost socks, puzzle pieces and those darn clear 1x2 legos which make such great windows but always end up behind the couch or under a pile of books. If they&#39;re doing something with small pieces, throw a sheet down so you can scoop it all up later, when they want to build a fort in the same room. Have lots of baskets and hampers to toss things into as you go by, or lots of tables and shelves to heap things on if your kids (like mine) just can&#39;t resist playing with the darn bins. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids want to do something in a cluttered space say &quot;sure, give me a hand making room&quot; and clear a spot. Take five minutes here and ten there to do a few dishes, or toss some laundry in the washer. Fold the laundry while watching tv or playing board games. That&#39;s also a good time to chop veggies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how I can manage to clean and maintain a big home<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Make the activity more central - bring toys, tvs, computers, game systems into the living room and kitchen. That lets you do little household tasks close to the kids And it keep the action (and hence the mess) contained. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider hiring someone to clean or trade of cleaning with another mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We have 2 dogs and a ferret, so if I don&#39;t clean constantly, the<br/>\n&gt; hair just piles up in every corner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you need your home to be so clean that animal hair in the corners is a big deal, then unschooling may not be a good fit for you.

I clean it enough so we can<br/>\nlive healthily, but honestly my son will not remember if my bathroom was<br/>\nspotless.  I do think, though, that he absolutely will remember every time<br/>\nI tell him I can&#39;t play because I have to clean it. When we need the house<br/>\nto be clean because we are having guests etc... we clean it good enough for<br/>\nthem.  When I need pots to make dinner, they get done.  When I am sick of<br/>\nlooking at piles of laundry, I do a load.  You cannot have everything all<br/>\nthe time.  Yes I do wish my house was less cluttered and less dusty, but<br/>\nwhen I reflect on it, I always think to myself .... When my son is on his<br/>\nown and out of my house and I look back on our (very) short time together,<br/>\nwill I appreciate the time I spent playing with him or the time I spent<br/>\ncleaning?  When I am dead and gone my legacy is my son, not my house, and<br/>\nthat is where I want my focus to be.  Last year both of my grandmothers<br/>\npassed away within a week of each other, and none of the beautiful eulogies<br/>\npresented by their combined 14 children had anything to say about how clean<br/>\neither of their houses were.  They spoke of time in the garden together,<br/>\nspecial moments painting together, piano playing, trips being taken, and<br/>\nlove being shared.  These were the memories that stuck with their children,<br/>\nnot the memories of how clean their childhood houses were.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cannot fathom not having a clean house, perhaps it&#39;s time to<br/>\nreadjust the budget and hire someone to help you.  $80 a week seems like a<br/>\nsteal to get your needs met and to have more time with you children.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\nHappily living with 2 cats, 2 birds, and loads of dust bunnies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas on time management, without giving up my time with the children.","postDate":"1340557295","msgId":67920,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFQzkzNjUxLTRCMUYtNEI3Ni05OTM5LTk2QjIyMkJGMjRGMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRlpqNytRSEhNUndjdWpXNlI0M0hSS0JSd2h4QUN3Q21kK0RZSz1NRmM3NXhIMC1Pd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBRlpqNytRSEhNUndjdWpXNlI0M0hSS0JSd2h4QUN3Q21kK0RZSz1NRmM3NXhIMC1Pd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67916,"nextInTopic":67921,"prevInTime":67919,"nextInTime":67921,"topicId":67916,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-so can anyone please give me some ideas or examples on how I can manage to clean and maintain a big home without taking time away from my kids?-=- You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-73215710\">-=-so can anyone please give me some ideas or examples<br/>\non how I can manage to clean and maintain a big home without taking time<br/>\naway from my kids?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot have a large house that seems not to have children in it AND have children who get lots of attention from their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrioritize.
