They (the hotel) have property <br/>\ninsurance, you should have been given information about filing a claim.  They <br/>\nshould be clamouring for a way to appease you without a lawsuit being filed - <br/>\nit&#39;s easier and cheaper to treat you well on the front end.  So, I&#39;d call in <br/>\ninquire about filing a claim.

After that they give you something extra to cover <br/>\npain and suffering or whatever they call it.  The insurance companies all <br/>\nhave formulas to figure out what to give you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe unethical part of this was their continuing a dangerous practice, a <br/>\ndanger to the general public.  It should&#39;t be much work on your part to get <br/>\nwhat they owe you.  I remember with workers compensation, any time a surgery <br/>\nwas involved, there was a &quot;permanency&quot; award, because part of that injury <br/>\nwould never go away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRambling thoughts, just took a painkiller myself - after begging for some <br/>\nfood.

Not near enough to touch, though <br/>\n  that would have been nice.  I needed to have room go get out with the walker <br/>\n  and get to the toilet.  But she read me to sleep.  I had my choice of Henry <br/>\n  Babysits or Green Eggs and Ham.  I chose the latter.  This morning she read <br/>\n  me Henry Babysits.  That was sweet of her to offer to read to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I got my ankle and foot swollen by staying up so long yesterday, and <br/>\n  so the cast was uncomfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I really hate the idea of suing a place for an injury, but truly that ramp <br/>\n  was bad.

He and four other guys were <br/>\n  going to a tournament.  A newish card game about wrestling.  Raw Deal?  Raw <br/>\n  something.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  They&#39;re taking my van, and they&#39;re not back yet.  Probably will be back <br/>\n  around midnight.  The one who&#39;s driving is 22 or 23 or so, has a college <br/>\n  degree, a real job, an apartment.  I think there are no other drivers.  So I <br/>\n  told Kirby it&#39;s the others&#39; duty to have someone assigned to stay awake and <br/>\n  amuse the driver for safety purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve loaned our van twice before to Kirby-groups.  He&#39;s not driving at all <br/>\n  yet, but several of his friends can, and we&#39;ve sent 17 year old drivers twice <br/>\n  to take groups of kids, once to a movie, once to a party in a neighboring <br/>\n  town.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some of you with older kids are all used to this.

Call her up, find out what she likes best to eat <br/>\nand drink and go to the store and buy it. Now take it back to her (yes you <br/>\ncan eat some of the chocolate) and put it all in a cooler right beside her. <br/>\nPut the chocolate across the room. &lt;g&gt; Don&#39;t forget to get some nice smelling <br/>\npowder or lotion. Nothing too strong or sweet or overly flowery. Something <br/>\nnice and calming. She can use it after she gets her sponge bath. My choice <br/>\nwould be just plain old baby powder. Nothing is nicer than a nice scrub, some <br/>\nbaby powder and a clean soft cotton nightgown. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so sorry you don&#39;t feel good.
