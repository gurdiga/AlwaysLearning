I found it looking for something I  <br/>\nneed for the conference coming in September, but it reminded me of  <br/>\nthe recent bit on TV and parental control.  It&#39;s my writing, except  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s marked as quotes.  Everything from here down was then:<br/>\n<br/>\n======================================================================== <br/>\n====<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t even look back to see who the original author was, so I hope  <br/>\nthis will come across as totally clinical which it&#39;s intended to be.   <br/>\nTwo quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still have him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The question really is, can HE unschool and still accomplish his  <br/>\ngoals?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTerminology reflects thought and belief.<br/>\nSometimes just a slight shift in terminology will release the mental  <br/>\nblock that keeps people from understanding unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of examples:<br/>\nCalling grown women &quot;girls&quot; instead of women kept women from  <br/>\nadvancing for many years.   When someone learns to remember to say  <br/>\n&quot;women&quot; when they mean women, suddenly girls BECOME women in their  <br/>\nminds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNursing and childbirth counselors and midwives remind women to change  <br/>\ntheir terminology.  If a woman says, &quot;My doctor says I have to...&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me...&quot;  it&#39;s really worth interrupting and  <br/>\nasking them to change the words and thought to , &quot;My doctor  <br/>\nrecommends...&quot; or &quot;My doctor doesn&#39;t believe...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf woman give ownership of their babies to the doctor, they will not  <br/>\nbe able to make decisions and to act on their own beliefs without a  <br/>\ndoctor&#39;s approval or permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents retain ownership of their children&#39;s learning, the  <br/>\nchildren cannot learn on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve just said above is / will be / has been misinterpreted to  <br/>\nmean the parents should throw up their hands, back off, and not say a  <br/>\nword.  That&#39;s not what I mean at all.   Possibly the very same  <br/>\ninteractions can occur, but the balance of power and responsibility  <br/>\ncan change by changing the phrasing and definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can he unschool and still accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that different in wording only from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still  <br/>\nhave him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s 180 degrees of difference mentally, and very little  <br/>\ndifference in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a change worth making?<br/>\nI think it&#39;s absolutely necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen forceful suggestions are made here, though, sometimes people  <br/>\ntake it as criticism or attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re trying to help push someone&#39;s car and it&#39;s not going  <br/>\nanywhere, sometimes pushing harder helps.  Occasionally, though, you  <br/>\njust HAVE to say, &quot;Is it in neutral or not?&quot;   If they say, &quot;No, it&#39;s  <br/>\nin first gear, push harder,&quot; what are you going to say?   You stop  <br/>\npushing and say &quot;You HAVE to put it in neutral first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo before anyone can enjoy the benefits of unschooling they HAVE to  <br/>\n&quot;put it in neutral.&quot;  They have to take off the emergency brake.   <br/>\nOtherwise the car won&#39;t move.  Too many people say &quot;We tried pushing  <br/>\nthe car, it didn&#39;t move, we bought a new one.  Pushing cars never  <br/>\nworks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26301,"nextTopicId":26307}}
