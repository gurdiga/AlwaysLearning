It was Christmas, and I had our most-of an Italian creche <br/>\nscene set up, and the figures being about Ninja Turtle size, they&#39;d be <br/>\nborrowed to go on adventures.  The shepherd carrying a lamb on his shoulders <br/>\nwas a favorite.  But in the place of the missing shepherds or wise men would <br/>\nbe a Ninja Turtle adoring Jesus.  And it changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t spirituality, it was action figures.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve found more spirituality in the course of things than from any one <br/>\nspecific book.  When kids ask why someone did what they did, why this, why <br/>\nthat (in Rumplestiltskin, or Sleeping Beauty, or in a movie or in real life) <br/>\nwe had chances to discuss how people decide what to be like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone in a homeschooling discussion years ago asked how, if we weren&#39;t <br/>\nChristian, could I possibly teach my children about morality.  It was a <br/>\nfascinating question.  I remember being Christian and having the feeling that <br/>\nI was good because I was following the example of Jesus.  Others, without <br/>\nthat example, must obviously and easily choose the bad over the good, because <br/>\nit must obviously be so much easier and more desireable, and that without <br/>\nJesus I would be a murdering, lying, adulteratous, covetous, <br/>\nworshipping-other-gods shoplifter.  Why not!?  <br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out it was the Christians who were having a hard time teaching <br/>\nmorality.  They simplified it, as it had been for me, to the point that there <br/>\nwas NO reason to be good whatsoever except for the fear of punishment (from <br/>\nGod or God&#39;s representatives, the parents, directly on behalf of God).  So <br/>\nsure enough, some of those kids longed to leave home and get drunk and break <br/>\nstuff and say bad words and be rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve bought some books from Chinaberry about God and spiritual matters, and <br/>\nwe have the Dorling Kindersley and Usborne books on comparative religion <br/>\n(which I love to read from to the kids or to myself, and which we use for <br/>\nreference when someone&#39;s religious holidays or cultural restrictions comes <br/>\nup).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concepts of respect, compassion and gratitude, though, are dealt with in <br/>\nEnglish, without juju, without threat of deitary disapproval.  It&#39;s &quot;the <br/>\nGolden Rule&quot; in 45 words or more--not a platitude, but a reminder of their <br/>\ncare of themselves and their friends and family with a sweet attitude.  The <br/>\nidea that if they somehow make a situation worse, they&#39;ve screwed up and need <br/>\nto take out their handy, ready tools to make it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  A good place to start with little children and spirituality would be the <br/>\ncollection of &quot;Do unto others&quot; from various religious writings which has been <br/>\ncollected up for several years.  I&#39;ll look for it.  It&#39;s a wonderful intro to <br/>\ncomparative religion without needing any knowledge of history or geography.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Eax3lfuluoKfkRtOmJoPKDbY5oaT3u-uC_iaXV_rZolaORsjdX_IjTzIdFhKVUT5Cprx2ouRht9u5xKJj0RXsn-KdNA0YTEbqzg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Kids and spirituality","postDate":"1007121790","msgId":131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4MkNERkFELjI5NDYlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDl1MHA5bytjYmdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107,"nextInTopic":135,"prevInTime":130,"nextInTime":132,"topicId":1,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 11/27/01 2:24 PM, cleblanc@dcn.davis.ca.us at cleblanc@dcn.davis.ca.us ...

I remember <br/>\nwhen my son Gabriel (22 years ago) died, the kids in his <br/>\nMontessori school had wonderful thoughts and questions about <br/>\nGabe&#39;s dying. The adults didn&#39;t like to talk about it and were very <br/>\nuncomfortable. Answering your son&#39;s questions, exploring <br/>\ntogether the answers is a very good thing to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how old your son is, but you might consider letting <br/>\nhim attend different church-based youth groups, to see the <br/>\nsimilarities/differences.

I am a Director of Religious Education at a <br/>\nUnitarian Universalist church, and I&#39;m currently writing a book about <br/>\nspiritual education, kind of from an unschooling perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, I would do a few things. First, when he asks questions, <br/>\nask him what he thinks (not in a way that suggests you&#39;re testing <br/>\nhim, but let him know you&#39;re curious.) Tell him that a lot of this is <br/>\nnew to you, and you may not have thought about it, but that you&#39;d <br/>\nlike to explore together. If you DO have a thought about it, <br/>\ncertainly share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of wonderful books to strew about, about different <br/>\nbeliefs, people&#39;s ideas about answers to those Big Questions, etc.  I <br/>\nwould suggest lots of walks in nature.  Maybe quiet times. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling really allows both children and adults a real <br/>\nopportunity to connect spiritually, and you&#39;re not likely to pass <br/>\ndown a lot of dogma about what your son HAS to believe. That will <br/>\nallow him the freedom to find out for himself what he really DOES <br/>\nbelieve...and see that it may change over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn Baptista</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ddzimlew@juno.com","from":"ddzimlew@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4KDfMftccZulwJnSMGrUN5AqtNkg1Q2lWwGuJAMUey6LIomuQ4aYMnIEbhAjFAJ6XRf3xwxBFgA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids and spirituality","postDate":"1006719753","msgId":5,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTI1LjEzMjI0MC4tOTk0NDkuMS5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":3,"nextInTopic":20,"prevInTime":4,"nextInTime":6,"topicId":1,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
