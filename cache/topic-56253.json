Following new threads is good but<br/>\nold ones are, in a way, more productive for someone like me who wants<br/>\nto see what happens without having to wait and wade through new stuff<br/>\neveryday. The archives have already happened, so they are incredibly<br/>\nhelpful and the new stuff coming down the pipe (believe me) is about<br/>\n9/10ths a repetition of what has gone before on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of things I&#39;ve learned on this email list about unschooling is<br/>\nthat human nature is a very determinedly steady indicator of what will<br/>\nhappen on the list, and that&#39;s why we see the same questions being<br/>\nposted over and over again. Go look in the archives. Almost everything<br/>\none can think to ask about unschooling has been asked already. The<br/>\nsearch function is ok and better than it was when I started reading<br/>\nthe list. It&#39;s been improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nHint: to see all of a thread, there&#39;s a link at the top of the<br/>\nmessages so that threads appear either in the time each post was<br/>\nposted or grouped by topics. Click &quot;Group by Topic&quot; and save yourself<br/>\nthe trouble of losing half or more of the threads you&#39;re reading and<br/>\nso that you can see the progression of the thread you&#39;re on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe websites are great because topics are already right there in the<br/>\nmargins to click on. You&#39;re already reading online by being on an<br/>\nemail list. And reading on a website though different can be<br/>\nproductive in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent loads of time reading. Otherwise being discouraged isn&#39;t hard<br/>\nfor someone who has almost no support in the community except<br/>\nincidentally for unschooling. What I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t like anything the<br/>\npeople around me are doing, for the most part. There are elements of<br/>\nit in gentle parenting, but unschooling goes beyond gentle parenting<br/>\nby supporting a child&#39;s interests in ways that really push the<br/>\nenvelope.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular, I hardly ever meet people other than unschoolers who<br/>\nare so pro-vidgame/tv, etc. Most people are decidedly anti. It&#39;s hard<br/>\nto imagine a more comprehensive learning resource, and NOT using seems<br/>\nincredibly wasteful unless one&#39;s child isn&#39;t interested of course. But<br/>\nmine definitely is interested. If I weren&#39;t reading and hadn&#39;t read<br/>\nfor a long time all the information about how great such a resource<br/>\nis, I could easily be led to think I&#39;m not doing the right thing to<br/>\nlet Karl delve into such an interest to such a degree as he has. He&#39;s<br/>\nvery knowledgeable about so many things due to that interest. Things<br/>\nwhich sometimes wows him and other times he takes for granted. Things<br/>\nI can&#39;t take for granted and still appreciate the thing that<br/>\nunschooling is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing goes in particular with food. Most people are not very<br/>\nrelaxed about food consumption for their children. It either must all<br/>\nbe eaten or only certain things are allowed. But unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>\nabout how much or what to eat. It&#39;s about what the child, the person<br/>\nwhose range of choice unschooling can enhance considerably. I have<br/>\nonly one non-unschooling friend who is friendly about food and choice<br/>\nfor her children (and others). Right, I don&#39;t have lots of friends but<br/>\namong the friends I have, only one is generous about food choice in<br/>\nthe family. :) Pretty much everybody else seems to be about<br/>\nrestriction for everyone. The opinionated ones raise eyebrows about<br/>\nKarl&#39;s eating choices if it&#39;s not &quot;good&quot; for children or assume that I<br/>\nchose his food if he eats what they think of as &quot;good&quot; food.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not a difficult concept, even if at first blush a<br/>\nparent doesn&#39;t agree with it. What&#39;s difficult is knowing how to<br/>\nsupport unschooling for one&#39;s own unique child. It took a lot of<br/>\nreading and doing and experiencing the effects of it in our own family<br/>\nto figure out the nuts and bolts of unschooling, what it is, what it<br/>\ndoes, how to do it.
