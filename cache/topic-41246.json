According to her email, it will need thousands of <br/>\nvotes to be passed/heard?  I thought this list was a good place to post it as there are so <br/>\nmany members!  Here is what her e-mail said:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The opportunity is urgent as now is the deadline (the 31st at midnight):<br/>\nIf you would like to make your voice heard with the new president, please<br/>\nvote on my parenting recommendation and on my other posts at change.org. You<br/>\nwill have to sign up but you will not get emails as a result of it and it is<br/>\neasy and quick. If we get enough votes by Wednesday midnight, it will be<br/>\nseen by Obama&#39;s management. It takes a couple of thousands votes so it will<br/>\ntake a miracle to get enough votes since I just created it but there are<br/>\nmany thousands of us so it is possible. Feel free to pass it on.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children\">http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks! <br/>\n<br/>\nLauren :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41244,"nextTopicId":41238}}
