I am in harmony with the growing number of <br/>\nthinkers coming out to say &quot;there is no God.&quot;  With them I fear that it <br/>\nis not only the Islamic and Christian fundamentalists who would lead us <br/>\nback to the days of the Inquisition.  It is also the masses of people <br/>\nwho have faith in any magic or divine power to solve the problems made <br/>\nby humans.  [Or to win their football games]. All believers in <br/>\nreligions support by tolerating those who who take their faith to <br/>\nextremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the same time I worry about people who don&#39;t recognize that we <br/>\nall live on faith in most of our daily lives.  I know of few people who <br/>\ncan PROVE that the earth is a globe.  Or that the universe was started <br/>\nby a big bang.   Or that mass and energy are the same thing.  I have <br/>\nfaith in the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics,  and I also <br/>\nhave faith in Gaia theory,  Chaos theory, and Complexity theory.  This <br/>\nis not religious in the sense of being something divine, magic, or <br/>\nanything else outside the laws of nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take my faith in scientific theories beyond the limits of the <br/>\nscience.  While in science of Gaia theory is about unity of the <br/>\nphysical earth and life on earth.  It finds that life on Earth is made <br/>\npossible by live on Earth.  All entities in the universe are <br/>\ninterlocked and interdependent.  No entity can exist without the <br/>\nothers.   I see this faith as applicable to the social sphere as it is <br/>\nto the biological and physical spheres.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is in that sense that I write about a &#39;Gaian Paradigm&#39; as replacing <br/>\nthe &#39;dominator paradigm.&#39;  Like the scientific Copernicus paradigm <br/>\nreplaced the world view of the earth as the center of the universe with <br/>\nheaven out there and hell down there.  And like the  Darwinian paradigm <br/>\nreplaced the world view that man was different, better and above all <br/>\nother life form. So the Gaian paradigm is revealing the unity and <br/>\ninterconnectedness of all things in the universe including humans with <br/>\none another.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like more on the GaianParadigm see:<br/>\n      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Bill_Ellis\">http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Bill_Ellis</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27435,"nextTopicId":27413}}
