However, I want you to know that in all of that meta analysis, in all of the reading and educational research, nothing has proven to be more valuable to me than what I have learned from reading your list, AlwaysLearning.â<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been places online I have loved.  The AOL forum when we got a special area for unschooling.  Unschooling.com (long defunct) which Home Education Magazine (now defunct) set up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Always Learning has been the best. And nowadays, people are using facebook more than e-mail.  I understand it.  I do miss the days when this forum was busier. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I was reading some in a thank-you book that Heather Booth organized for me, for one of  a Always Learning Live symposium (a defunct series of gatherings). :-)  Her husband, Monty, formatted it, and because I wanted to keep it where my kids could read it someday, itâs hidden (not âhidden,â butâ¦) on my site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/feedback/Thank_You_Sandra.pdf\">http://sandradodd.com/feedback/Thank_You_Sandra.pdf</a><br/>\nSafari wouldnât open it, but Google Chrome did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom who wrote the very-sweet quote above is stealth in the group, so I would rather not name her, but it made me feel good this morning, again, and I appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways Learning is nearly 16 years old.  Thatâs older than most peopleâs children. :-) <br/>\nBut there are people still here whose unschooled children are grown now, and thatâs valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first post, in Novermber 2001, was by Deb Lewis.  Thatâs a treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to have hundreds of posts a month here.  Nowâ¦dozens, usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, all, for reading and contributing (if you did either or both).  <br/>\nIâm still here. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHereâs what I wrote last fall about being tired.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/11/slowing-down.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/11/slowing-down.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78098,"nextTopicId":77947}}
