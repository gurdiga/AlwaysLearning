Little kids don&#39;t like to wait for food,  and even at ten,<br/>\nwhen he knows how to make so many things, my son still sometimes prefers<br/>\nfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make a sandwich or two in the morning and cut it and wrap it separately<br/>\nand have it in the fridge, ready to grab.   I wash fruit and leave it on<br/>\nthe counter.   I wash grapes and carrots and put them into little zip loc<br/>\nbags.  I always have bananas and nuts and seeds.     <br/>\n<br/>\nKids will balance their food consumption naturally as long as they have<br/>\nchoices.  If the only choice for quick and handy food is chips, etc. then<br/>\nthat&#39;s what they&#39;ll eat.  If  other choices are just as quick and handy<br/>\nthey get equal consideration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt works!  You&#39;ll survive.  = )<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10258,"nextTopicId":10238}}
