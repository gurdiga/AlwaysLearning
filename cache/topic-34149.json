Since I&#39;ve been trying the &quot;no<br/>\npunishment&quot; etc. approach, each situation--where I would normally say, &quot;Go<br/>\nto your room!&quot;--has been dealt with in a more loving and thoughtful way.<br/>\nI&#39;m trying really hard to see things from his perspective.  Today, N flipped<br/>\nout because we turned the bathroom faucet off on him. (He was outside and<br/>\nleft it running.)  He stormed off outside, screaming that he wanted to<br/>\neither die (from the mountain lions that live near our house) or kill me!<br/>\nNormally I&#39;d freak out because he had gotten so violent.  But today, I<br/>\napproached him in a very loving way.  I ignored the comments and made him<br/>\nunderstand that I loved him, no matter what, and then began to help him see<br/>\nthat we weren&#39;t trying to be mean to him.  In the middle of our<br/>\nconversation, just as I was wondering if I was approaching this the right<br/>\nway or not, he suddenly said, &quot;Oh Mommy, I forgot to tell you!  I just saw a<br/>\nwhole herd of deer galloping away a few minutes ago!  They went that way.&quot;<br/>\nThen he continued his happy banter and completely forgot that he was mad at<br/>\nme!  Just like that!  I was floored!  It was like a switch went off in him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am starting to see how my changes are affecting him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a situation that I&#39;m not sure how to approach:  N (6) is constantly<br/>\nhitting DH and I!  He does it when he is angry or frustrated.  He runs up,<br/>\nhits us, and then runs away.  We (DH especially) find it really hard to just<br/>\ndo nothing about this.  And by &quot;do nothing,&quot; of course, I mean punish.  Even<br/>\nthough we talk to him about other ways to vent his frustration, we feel like<br/>\nwe&#39;re &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  Logically, I get the fact that it would really do<br/>\nhim no good to be punished.  I understand that no matter what the punishment<br/>\nwould be, he wouldn&#39;t learn the lesson we are trying to teach (&quot;No<br/>\nhitting&quot;).  I guess what I am having trouble with is the trust issue.  I<br/>\nfind it really hard to believe that if we don&#39;t do SOMETHING to show him<br/>\nthat it is not okay to disrespect his parents (or anyone, for that matter),<br/>\nthen he won&#39;t ever learn that.  (You know those disrespectful adults that we<br/>\ndesperately don&#39;t want our children to turn out to be?)  I suppose it&#39;s<br/>\nabout fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing:  I feel like I&#39;ve been trying so hard to be loving and<br/>\nrespectful in my new approach to parenting, that I am putting my own<br/>\nfeelings on hold.  Now to a degree, that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do as the<br/>\nmature adult.  But I don&#39;t think hiding my emotions is really healthy for<br/>\neither of us.

It&#39;s interesting that you ask do  <br/>\nwe never &quot;have to&quot; punish/reward/praise - because people tend to  <br/>\nassume that parents &quot;have to&quot; make children do certain things.  I am  <br/>\nnot &quot;permissive&quot;, in that I am authentic and direct with my kids and  <br/>\nI have personal limits - which are few (and negotiable), and I  <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t expect my kids to remember my limits and follow them,  <br/>\nbecause I know that humans often have unmet needs or just impulses  <br/>\nthat over-rule &quot;doing the right thing&quot; even when it is what they want  <br/>\nto do (and I always assume positive intent) and I &quot;set&quot; my limits in  <br/>\na respectful way that honors all of our feelings and deepens our  <br/>\nconnection.  To me, &quot;misbehavior&quot; is all about unmet needs, so if a  <br/>\nchild gets punished for having a need (that they are expressing in a  <br/>\n&quot;mistaken&quot; way), the message of love and understanding doesn�t get  <br/>\nthrough, and the underlying needs are never addressed.  Manipulation  <br/>\nwith threats of punishment (or promises of a reward) breaks the  <br/>\nparent-child connection, and continues the cycle of pain - unmet  <br/>\nneeds � misbehavior � threats, etc.  Identifying and acknowledging  <br/>\nfeelings and offering understanding really goes a long way when  <br/>\nthings are hard - children have desires that sometimes just cannot be  <br/>\nmet (there are so many natural limits that occur in the world, i.e.  <br/>\nit&#39;s raining out and they were hoping for sun) but a parent can be  <br/>\nunderstanding and loving even when the child doesn&#39;t get exactly what  <br/>\nthey want.  Other things that help are having outlets for expressing  <br/>\nanger, play-listening and playful parenting, quiet/silent empathy,  <br/>\nunconditional forgiveness, reconnection through special time - and  <br/>\npreventing the need for limits - assess for hunger, sleep  <br/>\ndeprivation, need for connection, attention, down time/alone time, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the answer is YES, it can be done, and it&#39;s a beautiful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmiles,<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily<br/>\n<br/>\nin Portland, Oregon<br/>\nwith dh Michael<br/>\nds Morgan (12/91)<br/>\nds Seth (8/99)<br/>\ndd Sara Kate (7/01)<br/>\nand ds Jacob (12/04)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333194003,"authorName":"Kim Musolff","from":"&quot;Kim Musolff&quot; &lt;kmoose75@...&gt;","profile":"kimmusolff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1207794049","msgId":34172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkxOTIwajQ3ZGIxMzU4c2Y4ZjMwZjNlNzMzMTVjOGRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0am5pMCtib2d0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkxNDA5ajE4NzZhOTA4c2E2NTc5ODJlY2RlOGUxYzlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8ZnRqbmkwK2JvZ3RAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34170,"nextInTopic":34179,"prevInTime":34171,"nextInTime":34174,"topicId":34149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** He naturally uses his age-based superiority.

When this dynamic happens between my kids, the younger one is <br/>\nusually feeling a loss of power.  She is aware that her brother is stronger and intellectually <br/>\nquicker, so she will do annoying things like that to try to even the score.  When she <br/>\ndiscovered how much he detested being licked--well, that was fun!  He naturally uses <br/>\nhis age-based &quot;superiority.&quot;  He does it without thinking, and then seems genuinely <br/>\nconfused when she does something like that.  I&#39;m just wondering if that could be going on <br/>\nbetween your kids.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Normally I&#39;d separate them into different rooms (we don&#39;t really call it a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Time Out&quot; around here).  Then I&#39;d talk with each of them to figure out how<br/>\n&gt; to handle it better next time.  According to the &quot;parenting with&quot; theory,<br/>\n&gt; separating them is considered &quot;punishment.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can be challenging when both kids need your attention at the same time--that does <br/>\ntake skillful juggling, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re alone in feeling frustrated about that.  If only <br/>\nwe could temporarily clone!  I do find it to be more effective to talk with them separately <br/>\nat first.  I find they need to &quot;tell their story,&quot; which is often completely &quot;unfair&quot; and without <br/>\nany acceptance of personal responsibility at first.  So naturally the other will argue to <br/>\ncorrect it, etc., but that isn&#39;t helpful for helping one at a time process their anger enough <br/>\nto start hearing the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So today, I came into the room, asking, &quot;What happened?&quot;  N stormed off into his room <br/>\n&gt;(which I allowed him to), in order to cool off.  This wasn&#39;t mandated by me, he just did it <br/>\n&gt;on his own.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter appreciates a little time alone after a conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nZ and I talked about what happened.  N got mad that we were<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; talking without him and came back into the room and attempted to talk with<br/>\n&gt; us.  But really, he ended up yelling at both of us and when I asked him<br/>\n&gt; things like, &quot;How do you think Z felt when you plugged your ears and ignored<br/>\n&gt; her?&quot;  he just rolled his eyes, gave a half smirk, and said (very<br/>\n&gt; sarcastically) &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like he was still in the midst of the conflict, and was maybe still feeling a lack of <br/>\npower. <br/>\n<br/>\n Since he wasn&#39;t willing to talk, I told him<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we&#39;d talk later when everyone had calmed down.  He got even madder at that,<br/>\n&gt; and stormed off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That seems o.k. to me--he may still have needed cool-down time, but it also seems like <br/>\nhe may have wanted to re-establish connection and couldn&#39;t do it in the context of the <br/>\nconfict.  Perhaps an invitation to get you when he was ready to talk, or to check in with <br/>\nhim and see if he just wanted a cuddle, etc.  Sometimes just holding my daughter, when <br/>\nshe&#39;s ready, helps her to shift herself back into a more connected place.  Your son had lost <br/>\nconnection with himself, and with the rest of the family.  The more you can keep the door <br/>\nopen to him to come back into connection, the quicker he will make the transition.  <br/>\nPunishing, at this point, just drives a bigger wedge into the place of connection, gets the <br/>\nego involved, and makes everything harder than it needs to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs to know that hitting is not o.k., but it needs to come in the context of love and <br/>\nconnection with you--not judgement and isolation--then he&#39;ll only learn the lesson of <br/>\njudgement and isolation.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I didn&#39;t punish.  But I don&#39;t really feel good about how that situation<br/>\n&gt; ended either.  Do I just let it go?  Are situations like this over when<br/>\n&gt; everyone is calmed down and back into their thing?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When he&#39;s calmed down and in a more receptive mood you can talk with him about that--<br/>\npreferably with some physical contact.  That may come 2 minutes after the conflict, or it <br/>\nmay be an hour--whenever it is right.  Even if it&#39;s days later, he&#39;ll remember what <br/>\nhappened.  In the meanwhile, you can be connecting with your daughter and getting more <br/>\nunderstanding about what happened, so that you can help her with her part.  I find sibling <br/>\nstuff to rarely be about 1 victim and 1 perpetrator.  There&#39;s usually a dynamic that <br/>\nescalates--so can you catch it before it gets to the hitting stage in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In the meantime, do we talk about respect/ignoring each other/etc. at a later time, <br/>\n&gt;without pointing out any one specific instance.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am very specific, so that thoughts can be tied directly to actions.  And the less judgemental you can be the more potential there is for you to be present with your child.  <br/>\nIf you can get out of the mindset that you have to &quot;teach a lesson&quot; you&#39;ll be better off.  <br/>\nThink more in terms of helping your child process what happened so that they can gain <br/>\nunderstanding and insight into why hit.  You can then brainstorm some other solutions <br/>\nwith your child so that that awareness might carry forward into the next situation.  Your <br/>\nchild may even teach you a lesson--a lesson in sibling dynamics.  I didn&#39;t understand the <br/>\npower dynamics of what was going on (duh!) until my dd said it.  I don&#39;t even remember <br/>\nhow it came up, but it was through me really trying to understand why it kept happening <br/>\nand asking her lots of short questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But how do you do that?  What would you say without sounding like you&#39;re &quot;giving a <br/>\n&gt;lesson?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can start by asking questions.  Here are some samples:  &quot;What do you think about <br/>\nwhat happened between you and your sister yesterday?&quot;  &quot;Were you angry?&quot;  &quot;Were you <br/>\nfeeling like she wasn&#39;t listening to you?&quot;  &quot;Do you feel sometimes like she has more power <br/>\nthan you?&quot;  &quot;Do you hit her to get her to listen?&quot;  See what he has to say, and I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll <br/>\nget enough info to know where to go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Even in my personal life, I&#39;m not good at starting conversations like this.

According to the &quot;parenting with&quot; theory,<br/>\nseparating them is considered &quot;punishment.&quot;  So today, I came into the room,<br/>\nasking, &quot;What happened?&quot;  N stormed off into his room (which I allowed him<br/>\nto), in order to cool off.  This wasn&#39;t mandated by me, he just did it on<br/>\nhis own.  Z and I talked about what happened.  N got mad that we were<br/>\ntalking without him and came back into the room and attempted to talk with<br/>\nus.  But really, he ended up yelling at both of us and when I asked him<br/>\nthings like, &quot;How do you think Z felt when you plugged your ears and ignored<br/>\nher?&quot;  he just rolled his eyes, gave a half smirk, and said (very<br/>\nsarcastically) &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Since he wasn&#39;t willing to talk, I told him<br/>\nwe&#39;d talk later when everyone had calmed down.  He got even madder at that,<br/>\nand stormed off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I didn&#39;t punish.  But I don&#39;t really feel good about how that situation<br/>\nended either.  Do I just let it go?  Are situations like this over when<br/>\neveryone is calmed down and back into their thing?  In the meantime, do we<br/>\ntalk about respect/ignoring each other/etc. at a later time, without<br/>\npointing out any one specific instance.  But how do you do that?  What would<br/>\nyou say without sounding like you&#39;re &quot;giving a lesson?&quot;  Even in my personal<br/>\nlife, I&#39;m not good at starting conversations like this.  How on earth am I<br/>\ngoing to do it with my children????<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1207763319","msgId":34161,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0aXZobitrNXJuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkwMjA1cDIzYmFkYmY2ZzM1Yzg3MDY1N2QzMTQyMmZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34151,"nextInTopic":34165,"prevInTime":34160,"nextInTime":34162,"topicId":34149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Trust is <br/>\nthe key ingredient--you trust that your child wants to have positive interactions in the <br/>\nworld--just like you do.  You trust that they are capable of creating those interactions.  <br/>\nSometimes they will need help from parents, who are in a great position to be a trusted <br/>\nally if a child believes you are really on their side.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment doesn&#39;t teach--contrary to popular parenting advice.  Think about times that <br/>\nyou were punished as a child.  Did you want connection, communication and <br/>\nunderstanding, or did you want isolation?  Which situation is more conducive to learning, <br/>\nassuming that learning is the real objective?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe NEVER punish/reward/praise.  But what we do is celebrate, talk, hug & cuddle.  Some <br/>\nof us take our own &quot;time outs&quot; (completely self-determined when one of us needs to <br/>\nregroup).  It can sound like things are always smooth and &quot;perfect,&quot; but they arent.  The <br/>\nkids still argue sometimes, and have misunderstandings--although less as they get older.  <br/>\nMy dd (9) is quicker to fly off the handle than the rest of us--more passionate and volatile <br/>\nall around--and is learning all the time how to deal with herself.  She&#39;s the one who will <br/>\ntake herself out of the picture now.  She likes to be alone when she&#39;s really upset, and then <br/>\nshe&#39;ll usually come back refreshed and ready to interact again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut things aren&#39;t &quot;controlled&quot; by me--although I mediate when someone asks me to or if <br/>\nthings are emotionally spiraling beyond what the kids can handle.  The focus is always on <br/>\nlearning--not on punishing anyone--profound learning can&#39;t happen when there&#39;s <br/>\npunishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for the &quot;letting them do whatever they want&quot; piece, that&#39;s the biggest <br/>\nmisconception in unschooling.  Unschooling is about deeply partnering with your child.  If <br/>\nan activity they are engaged in is infringing on someone else&#39;s rights or property, it&#39;s your <br/>\njob as partner to help them get out of that situation, and into one that does work--with <br/>\nkindness, understanding, support and true desire to help them get what they really want.  <br/>\nThat can help cause expansion and understanding--whereas punishment causes <br/>\ncontraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1207738002","msgId":34151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMEFDRUQwLTQzMzgtNEVEQy04QjI4LUMyRTY3RTcxRDI2N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkwMjA1cDIzYmFkYmY2ZzM1Yzg3MDY1N2QzMTQyMmZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkwMjA1cDIzYmFkYmY2ZzM1Yzg3MDY1N2QzMTQyMmZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34149,"nextInTopic":34161,"prevInTime":34150,"nextInTime":34152,"topicId":34149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
