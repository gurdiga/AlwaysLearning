It is me that gets bored- you&#39;re right. and i do have a difficult time being still and feelings of unproductivity overwhelm me at times- that probably stems from my very tumultuous life growing up. the feelings of guilt are at times deafening and I want to scream! I am too hard on my self (dh says) it&#39;s true. It is such an intangible thing! Perhaps i am just too selfish. Wow, who would have ever thought that we could get so much out of this experience! I&#39;m being stretched daily and sometimes it hurts... y&#39;know? what a blessing though to have the opportunity to grow and blossom while truly &quot;knowing&quot; the people we brought into this world. sometimes it just amazes me how people can travail and birth these miracles (opportunities) and then so quickly disregard their importance in their own lives and never truly enjoy the blessing of their relationship with one another. the 5 of us were  having lunch yesterday and<br/>\n we were all talking and having a nice time and all of he sudden it hit me- I like these people and i&#39;m so glad to be with them all day. and how sad it would be if we weren&#39;t! if they went off everyday i would not know them and they would not know me and they wouldn&#39;t know one another. It encouraged me and made me stop and thank God for His goodness poured all over me!
