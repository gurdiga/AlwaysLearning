Santa and all...do we destroy magic and as adults do WE really see (not believe) or know that magic exists and what is magic?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1298993042\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess for me the question becomes if we stop lying to our kids about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Santa and all...do we destroy magic and as adults do WE really see (not<br/>\nbelieve) or know that magic exists and what is magic?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can destroy magic in the mind of someone. It&#39;s possible. You can<br/>\neradicate every instance you find.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many philosophers have tried and failed to distinguish the<br/>\ndifference between or determine the order of seeing and believing or<br/>\nbelieving and knowing? I don&#39;t think an unschooling list can decide<br/>\nthat for anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, there is magic in everything even, maybe especially, the<br/>\nlowliest things. I see magic in smiles and laughter (what *is* it<br/>\nabout smiles and laughter?), horns and wrinkles<br/>\n(http://www.amazon.com/Horns-Wrinkles-Joseph-Helgerson/dp/0618616799),<br/>\ntastes and smells, the spices I can put in food, fire, light, music,<br/>\nsound, sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake your own list of favorite magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently drew something on Tuxpaint (http://tuxpaint.org), using a<br/>\nfeature that is actually named Magic. Karl took one look at the<br/>\npicture (http://wp.me/pYi8H-3Z) and said &quot;everybody has a reflection<br/>\nof themselves.&quot; For me, that was quite a moment to hear him to say<br/>\nsomething about what he sees in all humanity. That&#39;s magic to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to be superstitious or religious a bit to see or<br/>\nappreciate or believe in magic. For some the word &quot;belief&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;believe&quot; doesn&#39;t enter into questions about magic. Magic can be<br/>\nequated with miracle or might not be. Belief, strictly speaking, can<br/>\nbe just doing without absolute proof one way or the other. It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be so exact. One doesn&#39;t have to accept something as real to<br/>\nenjoy it even though it might be preferable in some ways to have a<br/>\nfuller picture of truth. Even then the meaning is up for grabs. When a<br/>\nperson looks at an object, the eye sends signals to the brain and then<br/>\nthe viewer is the one who pulls together their own experiences to<br/>\ndecide what the signals could be about.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes. Learning itself is magic. I can guess how it works and try to<br/>\nencourage and assist it but I can&#39;t guarantee it or cast the spell<br/>\nthat makes it happen. It&#39;s mysterious enough that we need a list like<br/>\nthis just for figuring out as much as we can about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58342,"nextTopicId":58308}}
