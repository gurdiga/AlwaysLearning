Maybe one time you&#39;ll decide on the spur of <br/>\nthe moment to change your swim time so that you can participate in an <br/>\nexciting adventure like the one your kids just had. (It won&#39;t be the last <br/>\none, promise.) Think of the priority impact that will make. And no, I&#39;m <br/>\nreally not saying you shouldn&#39;t have gone to swimming. Really!

It gives the feel of a tunnel when you are in <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the center aile.  It would have been perfect *if* I had had rolls of brown <br/>\n&gt;&gt;craft paper.  They could have covered the shelves with brown paper and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;drawn heiroglyphs on it.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds perfect just the way it was. How imaginative and creative and fun! <br/>\nYou adding the idea of heiroglyphics may have interested them or it may not <br/>\nhave. Even if you had that stuff right at the moment. They got out of the <br/>\nactivity what they wanted and needed and had fun doing it. How wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It would have been soooooo cool.

You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need all of that for the kids to get a cool new exposure to life in <br/>\nancient Egypt. They got that. Schools add a lot of the stuff they do just to <br/>\nkeep the kids busy. You don&#39;t have to do that. You are free to let them flit <br/>\non to the next great discovery. They won&#39;t lose what they experienced about <br/>\nancient Egypt. They&#39;re not learning it for the test. They&#39;ll bring it back <br/>\nout when the need arises for them. Probably to make a cool connection about <br/>\nanother new discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I got the paper a few days later and told them what they could use it for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;but they had moved on to something else.

But more important is to be <br/>\nwith your children *in the moment*. In *their* moment. If they&#39;ve moved on, <br/>\nmove along with them. They may decide heiroglyphics sound cool 6 months from <br/>\nnow. They won&#39;t lose anything by trying it then. And they may find 87 uses <br/>\nfor that paper in the meantime. It all counts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I know but I want this great place where we can do cool stuff.  I want to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;give my kids the life in my dreams.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh, you&#39;ve got to know what I&#39;m going to say here. Your kids want the life <br/>\nin *their* dreams, and it may look different from yours. Just as my earliest <br/>\nreadings on homeschooling advised me not to rush right out to spend a lot on <br/>\ncurriculum, I&#39;m going to suggest that you not buy every cool thing you think <br/>\nyou might need on hand to complete your children&#39;s learning experience.

Keep your eyes open when you are in a <br/>\nstore for something that you think might be fun. BTW, did you know about all <br/>\nthe cool homeschool discounts you can get at stores like Barnes & Noble <br/>\n(20%), Zainy Brainy (10%) and Media Play (15%)?

Like one day after watching a show about Egypt featuring an archeologyst removing debri from a tomb, they went down in our basement as if they were in a tomb and hid clay figures in cat litter.  It was in a storage area of the basement that is lined on both sides with wide metal storage shelves.  It gives the feel of a tunnel when you are in the center aile.  It would have been perfect *if* I had had rolls of brown craft paper.  They could have covered the shelves with brown paper and drawn heiroglyphs on it.  It would have been soooooo cool.

Borrow a wildly <br/>\ndifferent CD from the library and play it while you&#39;re seeing how many <br/>\nbubbles within bubbles you can blow with a straw and some liquid soap. Scour <br/>\nthe internet for cheap and easy crafts and science projects. (We had so much <br/>\nfun with alka seltzer rockets one day.) Explore. Think. Do.
