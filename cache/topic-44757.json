But  <br/>\n7% (of the 65%) of homeschoolers follow a &quot;non-traditional approach&quot;  <br/>\nto homeschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean unschooling! It means they define  <br/>\ntheir approach as non-traditional (and the parameters of non- <br/>\ntraditional are a little clearer in the full questions). Contained in  <br/>\nthat 7% are people that could be identified as unschoolers (if they  <br/>\nwere given some unschooling test ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it doesn&#39;t give an exact figure but it gives an upper limit  <br/>\n(68,250).<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Joyce Fetteroll [<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 09, 2009 4:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: Mulligan, Gail<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Question about report: 1.5 Million Homeschooled Students<br/>\n&gt; in the United States in 2007<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Ms. Mulligan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was looking over<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.5 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2007<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009030\">http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009030</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009030.pdf\">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009030.pdf</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the chart shows that 65% of parents have an &quot;interest in a<br/>\n&gt; nontraditional approach to child&#39;s education&quot; but the text below it<br/>\n&gt; says &quot;interest in a nontraditional approach to education, 7 percent&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I assume one of them is incorrect unless I&#39;m misreading something.<br/>\n&gt; (From personal experience with homeschooling for 13 years the 7%<br/>\n&gt; figure seems to match what I&#39;ve seen even in more liberal<br/>\n&gt; Massachusetts.)

Seven percent said that,<br/>\n&gt; of the reasons to which they said yes, a nontraditional approach to<br/>\n&gt; education was their most important reason for homeschooling. Does<br/>\n&gt; that make sense?
