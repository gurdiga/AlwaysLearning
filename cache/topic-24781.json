I<br/>\n&gt; helped him sound out books that I thought were good ones.  He read,<br/>\n&gt; but did not love it until he began reading computer stuff. From this I<br/>\n&gt; learned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>\n&gt; interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>\n&gt; I.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>\n&gt; but started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>\n&gt; sit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>\n&gt; Then, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>\n&gt; Tolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.  He picks up Scientific<br/>\n&gt; American or National Geographic if he sees an article that interests<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My third is a daugher who I found trying to read Alphaphonics by her<br/>\n&gt; night light one night.  She liked the funny sentences.  She liked<br/>\n&gt; writing notes to me.  She liked word games.  Then, Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>\n&gt; She would occasionally ask for help with words. She is an excellent<br/>\n&gt; reader and loves foreign languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My fourth daughter did not do any phonics or lessons of any type.  I<br/>\n&gt; read a lot to her.

If a child and/or parent thinks that learning means the parent gets out a particular book to learn a particular subject, then unschooling isn&#39;t really happening yet in that family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler Waynforth","from":"&quot;Schuyler Waynforth&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Teaching a Child to Read ...","postDate":"1143126659","msgId":24799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2dWRxMyszdjdiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ2QUUzM0E4LTJDQ0YtNDAxOC1BNTRDLTEwNkRCMThDQUY5MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24798,"nextInTopic":24800,"prevInTime":24798,"nextInTime":24800,"topicId":24781,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I took me 10 years to figure out that<br/>\n&gt; kids do not need to be taught to read but will read when they are<br/>\n&gt; ready, when it is something they are interested in, and when it is fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I always enjoyed reading aloud to all my kids and that was probably<br/>\n&gt; the best thing I could do with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sat down and tried using phonics workbooks with my first son.  I<br/>\n&gt; helped him sound out books that I thought were good ones.  He read,<br/>\n&gt; but did not love it until he began reading computer stuff. From this I<br/>\n&gt; learned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>\n&gt; interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>\n&gt; I.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>\n&gt; but started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>\n&gt; sit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>\n&gt; Then, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>\n&gt; Tolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.  He picks up Scientific<br/>\n&gt; American or National Geographic if he sees an article that interests<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My third is a daugher who I found trying to read Alphaphonics by her<br/>\n&gt; night light one night.  She liked the funny sentences.  She liked<br/>\n&gt; writing notes to me.  She liked word games.  Then, Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>\n&gt; She would occasionally ask for help with words. She is an excellent<br/>\n&gt; reader and loves foreign languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My fourth daughter did not do any phonics or lessons of any type.  I<br/>\n&gt; read a lot to her.

I took me 10 years to figure out that<br/>\nkids do not need to be taught to read but will read when they are<br/>\nready, when it is something they are interested in, and when it is fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI always enjoyed reading aloud to all my kids and that was probably<br/>\nthe best thing I could do with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI sat down and tried using phonics workbooks with my first son.  I<br/>\nhelped him sound out books that I thought were good ones.  He read,<br/>\nbut did not love it until he began reading computer stuff. From this I<br/>\nlearned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>\n interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>\nI.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>\nbut started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>\nsit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>\nThen, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>\nTolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.

We stopped at lesson 65 because she was bored.  This was <br/>\nlong before we started unschooling, and yet even I could tell she didn&#39;t <br/>\n*need* that book.  She was just ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow NOT to teach reading:<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew, now almost 15, learned to read at age 12. We had started *teaching* <br/>\nhim at age 6, and eventually had used every single phonics program out <br/>\nthere (just name one, we used it) until he was 11; he struggled, we both <br/>\ncried, we fought, we struggled some more. He felt worthless, stupid, <br/>\nretarded, like he couldn&#39;t do anything else either, and stopped trying to <br/>\nlearn anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally got to a place where I laid it all down and stopped trying to <br/>\nforce him.  I had heard about unschooling, and I went back and re-read John <br/>\nHolt and just finally decided in my heart that even if he *never* read, it <br/>\nwas okay, and would not be the defining moment in his life.  I apologized <br/>\nto him, and continued to read to him, whenever he asked, for as long as he <br/>\nliked.  Sometimes he would try to follow along, and would ask that I hold a <br/>\nwhite index card under the lines as I read them, but mostly he just <br/>\nlistened.  It was not unusual for me to read three hours straight when he <br/>\nwanted me to, with him snuggled up next to me on the couch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix months after that decision on my part, I bought him a manga book <br/>\n(japanese graphic novel based on anime) that was based on his favorite <br/>\ncartoon, Rurouni Kenshin, thanks to someone on UnschoolingDiscussion <br/>\nmentioning it in a post. I told him I would read it to him that night, and <br/>\nI meant it. He took it up to his room, and two hours later came back down <br/>\nto tell me he had read it twice! That evening he read it to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks after that he was reading the rule book to the Lord of the Rings <br/>\ntabletop battle strategy game, written probably at a high school or early <br/>\ncollege level.  He has continued to read at that level ever since.  His <br/>\nfavorite books to read are G.A. Henty novels, which are historical fiction <br/>\nnovels.  Now I have to sometimes ask him to take a break because we have <br/>\nother plans. LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he still says he can&#39;t read.  I don&#39;t know why, and I don&#39;t know how <br/>\nlong that will last.  It breaks my heart every time he says it because *I* <br/>\nam the one that made him think that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably The Best Way to help a child who wants to read:<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned *my* lesson well, and now Aaron, who is five days shy of age 8, <br/>\nis making many reading connections, in total freedom. He knows most of the <br/>\nletters of the alphabet, and most of the sounds.  His world is saturated <br/>\nwith words and sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe write things with sidewalk chalk, we play Boggle Jr. when he asks, we <br/>\nread books together (but not every day...we are so busy sometimes it just <br/>\nfalls through the cracks), and just a few weeks ago he sat on my lap while <br/>\nI played Quiddler with two other women and helped me make words with my <br/>\ncards, and learned all about how almost every word has at least one vowel, <br/>\nand which ones were vowels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day he got a large Twix candy bar, and looked at it a long time <br/>\nand said, 4 to gowhat does that mean?  Even though the words to and go look <br/>\nsimilar, and no one had ever told him the difference, somehow he knew that <br/>\nto was oo and go was the long o sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nWord games, rhyming games, letter games, story books, soup labels, candy <br/>\nbars, street signs, shop signs, the tv guide, sidewalk chalk and finger <br/>\npaints and Magnetic Poetry on the refrigerator.  Words are all around us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, before buying 100 Easy Lessons or any other program, PLEASE read <br/>\nJohn Holt&#39;s book _Learning All The Time_.  Read it twice.  Read it three times.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can trust  your child to read.  Just because they ask, doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>\nhave to go out and buy anything.

I wrote a post about the book on<br/>\nmy blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://literarychildblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/book-review-teach-your-child-to-read.html\">http://literarychildblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/book-review-teach-your-child-to-read.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend it to everyone who asks about teaching children how to<br/>\nread.  It&#39;s a very easy system to follow.  My son (now 6) is a voracious<br/>\nreader and is rarely without a book in his hands!  My 3yo daughter is almost<br/>\nfinished with the book...(after finishing the book your child will be<br/>\nreading on a &quot;2nd grade level&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nNoelle<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://literarychild.com\">http://literarychild.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/20/06, beautifulgoddessmommy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beautifulgoddessmommy@...\">beautifulgoddessmommy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So if anyone<br/>\n&gt; has any advice on how to teach them to read, because they want to<br/>\n&gt; learn how, then please feel free.
