(Usually lately I find such things out from Marty or Holly, but  <br/>\nMarty was out of town...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty came back Sunday afternoon and said Jeff&#39;s family was camping  <br/>\nanother night and wouldn&#39;t be back until Monday.  I didn&#39;t think  <br/>\nKirby knew that, but Kirby would already have gone to work.  We can&#39;t  <br/>\ncall him at work.

Maybe he killed himself,&quot; and Holly said in 1/3 of a second,  <br/>\n&quot;Then the dogs will have something to eat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI HOOTED even though it&#39;s an awful, horrible thought, because it was  <br/>\nso unexpected and so quick.<br/>\nGood thinking.  Sicko, but quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today she wanted to play Zombies Ate my Neighbors, we cleared out  <br/>\na nice big space in the den, and she got all set up and the SNES  <br/>\nflashed once and quit.  Marty couldn&#39;t get it to go.  She called  <br/>\nKirby&#39;s cell.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby, who&#39;s fine and alive and at Jeff&#39;s house, told her he knew he  <br/>\nhad another SNES in his closet, he thought, but he had no idea where.<br/>\nKirby has a walk-in closet full of shelves and boxes.  Full.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to try to find a used one and order it online.  I was  <br/>\nalready at e-Bay and google, and Holly said no, don&#39;t yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;He has one in his closet, but he&#39;ll take it to Texas with him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;He&#39;s not taking his closet to Texas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd y&#39;know?
