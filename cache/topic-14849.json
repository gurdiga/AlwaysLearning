They were out playing <br/>\nin the back lawn and there was a hummingbird just sitting in the grass <br/>\nand it didn&#39;t fly away.  They got to get right up to it and see all it&#39;s <br/>\ncolors.  This happened to me a few years ago on the steps going up our <br/>\nback porch.  Each time, when I went to nudge the bird, it just flew <br/>\naway.  I&#39;m pretty sure they were young and paralyzed with fear until my <br/>\nhand coming at them startled them into motion.  But they really are <br/>\namazing creatures!  I love sitting in my screened porch just off my <br/>\nkitchen, sipping coffee and watching the hummingbirds sipping off the <br/>\ntrumpet vine flowers that cover the side screen.  It&#39;s just awesome. <br/>\n Happy spring...and summer!
