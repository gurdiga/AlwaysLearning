Some people aren&#39;t ready for serious discussions.  I think Rippy&#39;s right, and serious discussions can make a profound difference in people&#39;s lives, but what about those who just want to peek at some info and then think about it on their own?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://honeyhousekindgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://honeyhousekindgarden.blogspot.com/</a> has descriptions of days with a young unschooler, and nice photos, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/2011/01/why-my-kids-will-never-be-socialized/\">http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/2011/01/why-my-kids-will-never-be-socialized/</a> is a great blog post with a busy, happy, indirect answer to the socialization question.<br/>\nThat same blog has a good unschooling FAQ from a Christian point of view (and so includes the question Christians probably get most, which is whether it&#39;s possible for Christians to unschool).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/faq/\">http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/faq/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn my own site, I have a typical days section left over from the days before there were blogs. :-)  (And there are some more recent entries, too.)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s my socialization collection.
