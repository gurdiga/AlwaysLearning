We too are approaching our 24th anniversary in June and playing nice does seem to work really well.  Today I am paying bills, dong paper work for work, etc.   He was in the kitchen so I asked Ed if he would heat me up a piece of pizza - he asked how long I microwave mine - I said I cut mine into pieces first - he jokingly said something about my being so specific and more work for him - then later I asked him to do something for me and he gave me that look and I laughingly quipped &quot;Hey didn&#39;t you know that it is Princess Mom day?&quot;  - he started laughing.  He did it all, because I do for him all the time too. Even without him having to ask - though asking is fine too.  I really enjoy when he does something without my having to ask.  AND I really like to do things for him without him asking - simple things like make tea before I go to work if I notice the jar is low - as I know he really likes his tea.  He goes to bed knowing the jar is empty and when he gets up it is full.  He&#39;s never asked me to do this I just do it because it makes me happy to make him happy.  One day I forgot something to take to work - I didn&#39;t ask him but he saw it and brought it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Not Talking about your kids in front of them","postDate":"1206915654","msgId":33880,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZBQ0EyN0UyLURCOTItNEFFOC04MDE3LURGNzE0RDlENTFFRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZzcDI3citsYm43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZzcDI3citsYm43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33879,"nextInTopic":33881,"prevInTime":33879,"nextInTime":33881,"topicId":33801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-There are no stupid questions. -=- There are questions that probably shouldn t have been asked, or that if the questioner  had a second thought would not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1990336211\">-=-There are no stupid questions. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are questions that probably shouldn&#39;t have been asked, or that  <br/>\nif the questioner  had a second thought would not have been asked.   <br/>\nThere are irritating questions.

I commented how we were enjoying everything about Zac in this <br/>\nmoment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son is turning 13 in a few months, and I&#39;m feeling so awed by the young man he is <br/>\nturning into.  He wants to share everything with us.  My husband and I keep looking at <br/>\neachother, shaking our heads and not believing the conversations were having.  Neither of <br/>\nus would have EVER shared the kinds of things with our parents that he does with us.  <br/>\nAmazing!!!  And as time goes on we are developing such a nice give and take about his <br/>\ncare--sometimes he wants to be in charge of more of it and sometimes he wants us to be <br/>\nin charge.  The friction points seem to be lessening instead of increasing--maybe because <br/>\nour whole view is of him being capable.  As he grows, I&#39;m ready with the reins, handing <br/>\nthem over.  I didn&#39;t have any sense of that as a teenager.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel anticipation for him.  What will his future look like, what is he going to be up to <br/>\ntwo years from now, or three?  I don&#39;t feel any sense of the dread that people all around <br/>\nme feel--and many justifiably so.  We have some family friends whose children were about <br/>\n7 and four when my ds was born.  We watched them do very conventional parenting and it <br/>\nwas like watching a train wreck, but not being able to stop it.  Mom worked full time +, <br/>\nDad at home, but very unengaged, so even though they had a parent at home, he shut <br/>\nhimself away with his computer and hired a housecleaner/nanny.  And they&#39;ve paid the <br/>\nprice of disconnection with an 11 year old daughter who wanted to commit suicide, bouts <br/>\nof depression, boyfriends that were trouble, etc., and a son who has just faded and <br/>\nbecome kind of lost.  And it was all foreseeable, which has been the saddest part for me.  <br/>\nBut as long as they got reasonably good grades, they were pretty much left alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I get this continual message from the family that&#39;s something like, &quot;Just you wait--you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know yet.&quot;  And to some extent it&#39;s true--we haven&#39;t been through it yet--but <br/>\nfortunately, I get to read about it from all these awesome families on line who have been <br/>\nand not only lived to tell the tale, but thoroughly enjoyed the ride!  I&#39;m so grateful to have <br/>\nyour stories and your shiny bright teens and young adults to prove that there really is <br/>\nanother way and that it&#39;s not just luck!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not Talking about your kids in front of them","postDate":"1206820994","msgId":33858,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMDAwMWM4OTFkNyRlYzUwNzBiMCRhMmRjYTMxOEB1c2VyZTM4NWNiM2FkMD4=","referencesHeader":"PDM0MTAyOS4xMzk5OC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDwwMjZlMDFjODkxY2QkOGRiNTk1MzAkYTJkY2EzMThAdXNlcmUzODVjYjNhZDA+IDxENjhFMkQ1OC1DQzY5LTQ3MDAtOUFFRC1EMEFFQjgzMzZCNTZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33856,"nextInTopic":33859,"prevInTime":33857,"nextInTime":33859,"topicId":33801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ll have been married 24 yrs in June. =- 24 years!

Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It was a close call 20 years ago (before Zac was born).  But once we worked it out, it has been really great.  We really never fight.  I&#39;m more of the snappy one and the other night I was exhausted and snapped at him about a totally inane thing and he called me on it in a gentle way &quot;Hey grouchy pants, don&#39;t snap at me over that.&quot;  I realized I had snapped and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;m exhausted and didn&#39;t mean to snap.&quot;  This morning I made muffins. He told me, &quot;These are really good cashew muffins.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes they are.&quot;  He said &quot;You&#39;re supposed to say thank you.&quot;  I laughed and said &quot;Thank You.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Keith has problems at work about other people badmouthing their teens.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes that too - last weekend our brother-in-law called to help us with purchasing a new computer (he is a VP at Hewlett Packard and gave us some great pointers in what to get or not get).  We don&#39;t talk with him very often, but he was on the phone with me and then Ed for 2 hours before we even mentioned the computer.  He asked how old Zac is and when I said 13 he was all about teens and their problems.  He has a 21 yr old son and a 17 year old daughter.  He made a comment about how they will be happy when they are fully grown and past this stage - which really shocked me comming from them.  I commented how we were enjoying everything about Zac in this moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our new computer showed up this morning - it is sitting in boxes.  We have waited a year and a half for this new shinny gadget!  At first we chose to wait because windows XP had just come out and we were advised to wait until the bugs were worked out of XP so to speak.  Then we chose to wait due to money because we decided that we would get a better one with gaming components for Zac. This one has really gotten to Zac lately due to what it cannot do in terms of gaming - it cannot play most games, it&#39;s gotten slower, it glitches and kicks him off in the middle of games, or freezes up and he loses his game, or it freezes up and won&#39;t let us on-line at all, etc.  I finally said a couple of weeks ago to ED, &quot;Let&#39;s just get it ordered, we&#39;ve put it off long enough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  So it will be interesting to get it up and going - to see what new games Zac becomes passionate about.  Right now he is upstairs on an old dinosaur that does not even have internet capability.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lisa W.<br/>\n  . <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not Talking about your kids in front of them","postDate":"1206816570","msgId":33856,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ2OEUyRDU4LUNDNjktNDcwMC05QUVELUQwQUVCODMzNkI1NkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyNmUwMWM4OTFjZCQ4ZGI1OTUzMCRhMmRjYTMxOEB1c2VyZTM4NWNiM2FkMD4=","referencesHeader":"PDM0MTAyOS4xMzk5OC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDwwMjZlMDFjODkxY2QkOGRiNTk1MzAkYTJkY2EzMThAdXNlcmUzODVjYjNhZDA+"},"prevInTopic":33855,"nextInTopic":33858,"prevInTime":33855,"nextInTime":33857,"topicId":33801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= I get the same thing at work - there are two other people I work with that complain about their husbands all the time - I never really hear about the great","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-612801103\">-= I get the same thing at work - there are two other people I work  <br/>\nwith that complain about their husbands all the time - I never really  <br/>\nhear about the great things their husbands do - I never say a  <br/>\nnegative word about Ed.

I see a lot of parents (but not usually<br/>\nunschooling parents) do this a lot of the time. It happens to overwhelmed<br/>\nmainstream parents when they&#39;re &quot;venting&quot; and maybe are just trying to<br/>\ncommiserate or get sympathy and support, but I end up feeling bad for the<br/>\nkids there when they have to hear &quot;how hard it is to deal with them&quot; even if<br/>\nthey&#39;re supposedly not paying attention to the words, involved in something<br/>\nelse. In particular women who wouldn&#39;t dream of talking the same way about<br/>\ntheir husbands to neighbors or acquaintances (such as myself) will go on<br/>\nabout negative things. I guess they figure another mom will understand. When<br/>\nthat happens, it&#39;s kind of hard to know how to react. I used to try and turn<br/>\ntheir remarks into positive terms about the child (&quot;Johnny sure knows what<br/>\nhis tastes are, eh? &quot; when someone complained of Johnny being stubborn), or<br/>\nturn the conversation to them (as in &quot;Boy, you sure sound tired and<br/>\nfrustrated with life today&quot;) and sometimes offer to help by letting the<br/>\nchild come and play with mine, etc, but I was never sure if that was the<br/>\nbest thing to say/do, since it seemed a little like &#39;enabling&#39; to do just<br/>\nthat - continue whining about the child in front of them. But essentially I<br/>\nagree with Sandra that there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with speaking<br/>\npositively and genuinely about someone in their presence, adult or child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Mar 28, 2008 at 11:53 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   -=-Anyway, at one point. the book says that parents should never talk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; about their kids in front of them.
