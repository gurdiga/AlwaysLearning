Before learning about <br/>\nunschooling or attachment parenting (ten years ago or so) I told her no, she couldn&#39;t eat it.  Then when I was cleaning, I would find it behind chairs and under the bed, little caches of the <br/>\nstuff, ready for her to enjoy.  But she had to hide it from me and sneak to eat it.  (She ate <br/>\nsand, too, when we went to the beach.)  I&#39;ve noticed a couple times over the years, she&#39;ll <br/>\ntaste a little  dog food and laugh to herself.        She&#39;s 14 now and doesn&#39;t make it a regular <br/>\npart of her diet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Anniversary to this brilliant list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ann.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40485,"nextTopicId":40542}}
