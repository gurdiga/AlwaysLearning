The <br/>\nmessages pile up and my computer is slow as a snail...it takes <br/>\nforever to read everyones post.  That&#39;s why I end up staying up till <br/>\n3 or 4 am.  Regardless, I get a lot of info from everyone on the <br/>\nlists.  As long as it isn&#39;t interfering with my kids time with me, <br/>\n(which sometimes, i think it might be ) I guess there is no harm in <br/>\nit.  Sometimes, though, I find myself sitting here...&quot;just a quick <br/>\ncheck&quot;, I think...and then the baby comes and wants me.  Sometimes I <br/>\npush the envelope just trying to get through all of the <br/>\nmessages...checking them while she&#39;s eating, coloring, watching <br/>\nElmo...  I&#39;m seriously thinking about cutting myself back, <br/>\nlistwise...but it&#39;s hard to choose!!!  It isn&#39;t hard to choose <br/>\nbetween my children and my computer though.
