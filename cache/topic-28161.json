He won&#39;t use lip balm or anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI simply asked him if it was painful, he said it wasn&#39;t.  I told him that my<br/>\nconcern was that it might get infected and that I thought drinking more<br/>\nwater would help.  For several months he ignored my advice but then one day<br/>\nhe began drinking water saying he wanted it to clear up.  It comes and goes<br/>\nnow but he takes care of it himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could just calmly ask her if her fingers are bothering her or if<br/>\nthey hurt.  Say it like you would to an adult, ask her if she would like<br/>\nlotion or ointment.  If she were my child I would share my concern about<br/>\ninfection, especially on hands because they come into contact with so many<br/>\ngerms.
