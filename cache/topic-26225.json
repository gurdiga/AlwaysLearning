My name is Colleen, I&#39;ve been<br/>\nmarried to Rusty for 21yrs. come this Oct., we have two dd&#39;s, Sami<br/>\nalmost 13 and Madi almost 4.  We have always &quot;unschooled&quot; even when I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a name for it. We just did what &#39;felt&#39; right and natural and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t cause conflicts.  Sami was very easy going and agreeable back<br/>\nthen (not as much now at 13)&lt;g&gt; so parenting was quite easy.  Since Madi<br/>\nwas born, parenting has been a bit more challenging since she has a<br/>\nstrong sense of what she wants and we have had to reassess our parenting<br/>\nand go with a more gentle &#39;hands off&#39; approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n           Anyways to get to the point of why I am posting, when Sami was<br/>\nabout 8yrs. old she was heating up two pieces of pizza in the microwave,<br/>\nshe knew that one piece took 1min. so she asked me if 2 pieces takes 2<br/>\nmin. and I said yes probably.  She then asked me how many seconds are in<br/>\n2min., she knew there was 60 seconds in 1min., I then got paper and<br/>\npencil and showed her how to add 60 + 60, she got it right away, it<br/>\nliterally took seconds.  She then asked me to make up a whole page of<br/>\ndouble and triple digit addition questions so she could do them after<br/>\nshe ate her pizza, she has loved &#39;math&#39; ever since!!!!  There is also so<br/>\nmuch &#39;math&#39; in the analog clock.  When Sami was about 4-5 we made sure<br/>\nthat most of the clocks in the house were analog with numbers and there<br/>\nwere many many conversations about fractions and counting by 5&#39;s and<br/>\n10&#39;s, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n              When Sami learned to read it took a little longer than a<br/>\nfew seconds, it took about 2 weeks.  She was 8yrs. old and she was<br/>\nplaying a Pokemon video game (her favorite still to this day) and she<br/>\nkept calling me in the living room to read to her what the game said,<br/>\nafter many times of leaving the kitchen to read to her I got a little<br/>\nfrusterated and said to her I can&#39;t keep coming in and reading to you<br/>\nright now or I&#39;ll never get dinner ready and proceeded to tell her if<br/>\nshe wanted to learn to read she should just learn, and she knew she<br/>\ncould when &#39;she&#39; decided to.  Well in less than 2 weeks she went from<br/>\nrecognizing a few words to reading chapter books. I&#39;m guessing the<br/>\nmotivation to read her video game helped alot.<br/>\n<br/>\n                I truly, honestly believe that a child can learn whatever<br/>\nthey want to learn when &#39;they&#39; want to learn it and not before.  I feel<br/>\nthe hardest thing about unschooling is NOT listening to the negative<br/>\ncomments and just living our life the way we feel is right for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Thanks for listening<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Colleen & Rusty, Sami (12) & Madi (3)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213210624,"authorName":"Jenniffer Baltzell","from":"&quot;Jenniffer Baltzell&quot; &lt;jjfbaltzell@...&gt;","profile":"jjfbaltzell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Lookie here!","postDate":"1152384559","msgId":26238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5NmU0ZDg5MDYwNzA4MTE0OW43N2Q4NWM0ZnNhMGUxNDU4MjVjZTRkMWVkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzREQ1OTE4LUExMjMtNDUyQy1BODIzLUQ4NDBEMDhBQTk2NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEVBRUNERUU2LUI1MDMtNERBRi05QzY0LTI0M0UwMEE2ODQ4MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDwwMTMwMUM5Qy0xMkI5LTQ2QjYtOTE4MS1FN0E3Mzg1OTY5M0ZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CSA8NDk2ZTRkODkwNjA3MDgxMDI4cTJhMzU0Njg3cDYyZmUxZmU2OGJhMjViMjlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8MDNERDU5MTgtQTEyMy00NTJDLUE4MjMtRDg0MEQwOEFBOTY1QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26237,"nextInTopic":26239,"prevInTime":26237,"nextInTime":26239,"topicId":26225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"snore mute cure implore shake make flute? admire retire inspire -- Jenniffer in Harpers Ferry Listen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-974139290\">snore<br/>\nmute<br/>\ncure<br/>\nimplore<br/>\nshake<br/>\nmake<br/>\nflute?<br/>\nadmire<br/>\nretire<br/>\ninspire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJenniffer in Harpers Ferry<br/>\nListen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life? ~Mary Oliver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/8/06, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -=-Though it occured to me that these might have been adjectives or<br/>\n&gt; nouns<br/>\n&gt; first.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, that shoots my theory.

I&#39;ll mess with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo about silent &quot;e&quot;...<br/>\nSkip the next two paragraphs if you want to.  (Skip it all; I&#39;ll  <br/>\nnever know, but &quot;very best part&quot; part is the best part.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with every other single letter in native English words, it was  <br/>\nonce pronounced.  The more we say a word, the mushier and shorter and  <br/>\n&quot;flatter&quot; it gets, over the centuries.  Final vowels turn to a low-in- <br/>\nthe-mouth &quot;uh&quot; sound, but the vowel *before* the final vowel is  <br/>\npronounced clearly (generally, in English words).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the word for the female mom-horse used to go &quot;MAYruh but now it  <br/>\nflattened out to a little shorter &quot;a&quot; and a don&#39;t-bother &quot;uh.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Mar,&quot; meanwhile, had a short a always.  E&#39;s weren&#39;t put on to &quot;make  <br/>\nthe vowel long,&quot; they&#39;re left over from when they gave the vowel more  <br/>\npunch in the days they were pronounced, 600 years and more ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the very best part:   In school they told us that an  <br/>\napostrophe in a contraction indicates that letters were left out.   <br/>\nWell surprise!  The apostrophes in posessives show that letters were  <br/>\nleft out too, because even after the silent e&#39;s became more silent,  <br/>\nsometimes it was pronounced in a possessive.  But the way to indicate  <br/>\na possessive was to put an &quot;es&quot; sound at the end of a word.  Not &quot;an  <br/>\ns,&quot; but the sound (even before spelling and writing were part of  <br/>\nEnglish) &quot;es.&quot;  So if that sound is going to be mostly left off (the  <br/>\nvocalized &quot;e&quot; part), they just put &#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just occurred to me to wonder (I&#39;m not in a hurry to find out, but  <br/>\nif any of you happen to know or to be in a hurry to think it through  <br/>\nor look it up) whether all or most of the &quot;silent e&quot; words, which are  <br/>\npretty much four letter words from Old English that go consonant- <br/>\nvowel-consonant-silent e are nouns and adjectives.  I&#39;m thinking  <br/>\nthey&#39;re all nouns and adjectives, because the endings that went on  <br/>\nverbs were different than the endings of nouns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when people are writing for Rennfaire menus or for some  <br/>\nreason Being Fake-Medieval and writing junk like &quot;Ye Olde Soup Potte&quot;  <br/>\nor whatever, they end up putting &quot;e&quot; on words for which it makes no  <br/>\nsense whatsoever.  And you all know that although there was a  <br/>\n&quot;ye&quot; (form of 2nd person pronoun) that the &quot;Ye&quot; as &quot;The&quot; came about  <br/>\nbecause the mark for &quot;TH&quot; (a combined letter at one time, called a  <br/>\nthorn) looked like a y to people who didn&#39;t know what it was?  It&#39;s  <br/>\nkind of a pointy backwards p, or a &quot;less than&quot; mark with a vertical  <br/>\nline that cuts through the pointy ends a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTOO much history of English.  Sorry.<br/>\nI did spare you any mention of declensions.<br/>\n[DOH!!!]<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Lookie here!","postDate":"1152212407","msgId":26225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBRUNERUU2LUI1MDMtNERBRi05QzY0LTI0M0UwMEE2ODQ4MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26234,"prevInTime":26224,"nextInTime":26226,"topicId":26225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last night late Holly was hanging around where I was filing old correspondence and papers (really old, some of it) and in filing an on-paper chain letter, it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1889893249\">Last night late Holly was hanging around where I was filing old  <br/>\ncorrespondence and papers (really old, some of it) and in filing an  <br/>\non-paper chain letter, it went next to a folder I started in college  <br/>\ncalled &quot;Texas talk.&quot;  One of the phrases I had noted my older  <br/>\nrelatives using was &quot;lookie here&quot;  (who knows how it would be spelled— <br/>\nit was never written down).   I had made a note there that it was  <br/>\nfrom &quot;look ye here,&quot; and I&#39;m sure it is a long-forgotten contraction  <br/>\nof that, especially in &quot;y&#39;all&quot; land (ye all is a much better origin  <br/>\nthan &quot;you all&quot; which is used in more formal situations &lt;bwg&gt;).
