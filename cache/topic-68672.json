They are lots of fun! Complete with all sorts of gory sound effects, music, dramatisation, etc. You can download them from www.audible.co.uk (the US audible site doesn&#39;t seem to have them). The way I most easily found them was by putting Terry Deary into the author in the advanced search. For instance they have Vicious Vikings, Rotten Romans etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoyed reading Terry Deary&#39;s comments on his website and the newspaper articles he links to, where he talks about not wanting school teachers to turn his materials into lessons. Sometimes I think unschooling parents can do a similar thing! When I have at times invited my children to listen to a Horrible Histories audio CD with me, my children have jumped at the opportunity. Other times they&#39;re happier listening to the radio in the car or playing their iPods etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me quite awhile to realise that in our early unschooling days I often attached a type of subtle expectation or pressure to these types of audio books. My children sensed the subtlety and resisted the pressure. They were well aware of it, but it sadly took me some time to realise I was doing it. Now of course I totally know that there is just as much opportunity for learning and pleasure in listening to a contemporary radio station (or anything else) as there is in listening to Horrible Histories audio books. In fact, there is probably more, if listening to the radio station is done for pure pleasure and out of genuine interest, and listening to Horrible Histories has a particular pressure and &quot;should-ness&quot; attached to it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Horrible Histories , Literacy, reading for fun.","postDate":"1345430243","msgId":68686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjEwMS1XMjIxOTBBQjRFOThBQTM1MTNBODdDM0I3QjkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI1MDIyNDY5LTg5RTgtNDc1QS05OEIwLTRCRTUyMkQ0QTYxMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzNDUzODgyMzcuODY5MzMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDEzNDUzODg5MDguODkwODMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjAxLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEZDM0EyNDgyLTFFMjAtNDk3RC04NUZGLTVEMjI4RjVEQkI2RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4sPDEzNDUzOTY1MDAuNzU5MTAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPERVQjEwMS1XMTNFMUU1MDEwNThDOEM4QUJDMUIyQkI3QjkwQHBoeC5nYmw+LDwyNTAyMjQ2OS04OUU4LTQ3NUEtOThCMC00QkU1MjJENEE2MTFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68684,"nextInTopic":68695,"prevInTime":68685,"nextInTime":68687,"topicId":68672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==means not as interested== Yes, that s exactly what I meant!

And people in government are complete twonks. What they hell do they know? School is an utter waste of 12 years of your life. It should be a preparation for life, teaching the skills you&#39;re going to need, finding what you&#39;re good at and developing it. Instead, it&#39;s trigonometry, chemistry, French … Never been any use to me. My skill was writing. I was clearly good at it, getting good marks, but no teacher ever said to me: you should try to do something with this.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand the whole second link is about schools and he talks about Literacy:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/orrible-ofsted-puts-children-off-enjoying-stories-claims-author-terry-deary-7630397.html%c2%a0\">http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/orrible-ofsted-puts-children-off-enjoying-stories-claims-author-terry-deary-7630397.html%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Describing schools watchdog Ofsted as “Ofstapo”, he said: “Ofstapo say children are illiterate because they are not achieving standards — but what standards? Some muppets in Whitehall say they can’t spell. But the standards are arbitrary.<br/>\n“Children have never been more literate. They are always on Facebook and are texting. One 15-year-old girl told me she had reached the limit of her texts for the month — she had sent 10,000. She is doing the most important human activity of all, communicating with someone else, and it is condemned.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XNwLDsOcG_0?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":68664,"nextTopicId":68687}}
