Our house is small though, so Rodney runs a room air filter on high to create white noise when he goes to bed (and now that summer has set in, the window A/C adds more white noise). We added a window A/C to Andrew&#39;s room recently so that the room wouldn&#39;t get sweltering hot with the door closed (because of all the heat generated by the computer and gaming systems).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important for the parent who works out of the house / out of town (is your hubby still working out of town for big chunks of time???) to be able to come home and have that quiet and downtime, if that&#39;s what they need to transition from &quot;work&quot; mode to &quot;home&quot; mode. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour hubby&#39;s income funds, to some degree (maybe all?), your ability to be at home and to unschool, right? Is your son old enough to understand that? If so, approaching it from the perspective of &quot;because of what your Dad does, we get to do what we want to, so let&#39;s respect his need for quiet and downtime and his desire to spend time with us when he&#39;s home&quot; might be helpful for your son -- then ask him for his input on ways to help make that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son and his friends have access to your house for much of the day, take advantage of that and have the friends over while your husband is at work. Have them sleep over lots when your hubby is working out of town. Let their cups overflow with time spent together at your house, so that when your hubby&#39;s home the kids won&#39;t feel deprived of time together when the friends go home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have other ideas, but this post is long so I&#39;ll stop here :).<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345152630,"authorName":"Julie van der Wekken","from":"&quot;Julie van der Wekken&quot; &lt;thewekkenfam@...&gt;","profile":"vegfam3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Summertime & neighbor children","postDate":"1275675011","msgId":54638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1YmZpMytybGlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlseDVCd3BMUEh6OW5pTER5RmpqVnFscTBKVXpmU2VCS3BDcHZpU0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54606,"nextInTopic":54642,"prevInTime":54637,"nextInTime":54639,"topicId":54537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess we ll see how much the need to be here is as the summer progresses.

They owned a business<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that was located at the far end of our street, so they were physically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nearby, but they didn&#39;t come home for lunch or anything liek that. We were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on our own during the summers. My neighbor friends&#39; moms were SAHMs, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there were always several moms at home most days. Even though we had a pool,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we couldn&#39;t swim at our house without an adult at home and there wasn&#39;t an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adult at home during the day. But a friend who lived on the same street also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had a pool and her mom was nearly always home during the day, so the whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gang of kids on our street often ended up swimming at that friend&#39;s house.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another friend&#39;s family had board games, a trampoline, and a small fort of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sorts in the backyard. Those hours were more fun to be at when I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hang out with my friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think my mom didn&#39;t care that we would rather be at someone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house, rather it was more that her focus was elsewhere (running a business).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She grew up in an environment in which everyone pretty much was on their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with no real parental guidance or support or input, so setting up a house to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be kid-friendly and inviting to neighbor kids wasn&#39;t in her skillset. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few times when friends would be over, my mom and stepdad would be segregated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off into their bedroom and us kids would be on our own -- it didn&#39;t create<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that kind of welcoming environment I&#39;d feel when at my friends&#39; houses where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their moms would be visible and available and involved to some extent with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, it may not be that the kids&#39; parents don&#39;t care their kids would rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be at your house than their own, maybe it&#39;s that the parents don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skills to create the kind of home that is the house at which all the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to gather. Maybe it&#39;s a relief for them to know their kids have a safe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place to be, someplace where they&#39;re able to be with other kids rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bored at home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ===I guess I&#39;m feeling a bit spent after a week of hosting these 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children===<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But you&#39;re not obligated to host them to the point of being worn out, nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should you feel like a babysitter.

There is one boy who was always over at our house. He ate dinner with us almost every night. When snacks were offered he would inhale most of whatever it was before anyone else could get much. He would eat an entire bag of potato chips or box of crackers. I finally had to tell him that he would have to go home to eat if he was hungry because I just couldn&#39;t afford to feed him all the time. When he&#39;s here the kids get water to drink most of the time. When I do put out snacks, it&#39;s a limited amount and when that&#39;s gone, they don&#39;t get more. I tell my son if he&#39;s really hungry and wants more to eat, we can ask his friend to go home until we are done eating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m friends with his parents so I was able to talk to them about the situation, too.

Then not only did we not get some nice, fun family time with the kids and my husband, my husband didn&#39;t get his peace and quiet because Ethan would be crying and screaming. That was not fun for anyone. Talking to Ethan about it ahead of time to try to come up with an agreement didn&#39;t work. He just wanted his friends around. My husband finally realized that it was more peaceful and better for their relationship if he allowed the friends to be here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is, what do you do if one or both parents want times when it&#39;s just the family (as has been suggested here many times) but the kids are absolutely opposed?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":385963574,"authorName":"Christina Rieck","from":"Christina Rieck &lt;christinamrieck@...&gt;","profile":"heyteach24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Summertime & neighbor children","postDate":"1275625428","msgId":54660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsMDRPcENIaFlLZUFqaWc0VlQ4dzhkdU5Oci1GRlQycUtTT09adEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE2RjZDM0NDLTNERjktNEE0Ni05RUJGLTdEN0I3OUM4NEU3NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGh1OGdkayszNWlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aHU4dGJiK2g1cTRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1RpbHg1QndwTFBIejluaUxEeUZqalZxbHEwSlV6ZlNlQktwQ3B2aVNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTwwMEQ4NzRCOS0xNjQwLTRCREYtOTJEMS01N0VFRkZENEU1RDJAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1RpbkN3ZF9vZHQxeXZINUJyTU1LTUdCcDBZYnMxeXRKRWhIaThRU3BAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTxBNkY2QzNDQy0zREY5LTRBNDYtOUVCRi03RDdCNzlDODRFNzVAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54642,"nextInTopic":54661,"prevInTime":54659,"nextInTime":54661,"topicId":54537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===There ARE obligations in life, and there are things people think they should be doing for good reasons.

In fact, I was going to mention<br/>\nthat but I wasn&#39;t quite sure how to say it eloquently.  Yes, there are<br/>\nthings that I want do for very good reasons.  I want to take care of the<br/>\nneeds of my children because I can and they are mine and it feels like the<br/>\nright thing to do.  I want to stand up for justice issues because I can and<br/>\nit feels important to me.  I want to stop at stop signs because I know that<br/>\nthey help maintain safety.  There are many things I want to do that can look<br/>\nlike a &quot;should&quot; but really are desires to live in harmony with myself and<br/>\nthe people around me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the situation at hand is one that she could leave the &quot;should&quot; word<br/>\nout of .  If she is wanting the kids over, I think that is great.

I think it is okay to understand that her children may feel<br/>\ndiscouraged that she wants the friends to go home, but I think that if it is<br/>\ndone with creativity and empathy, everyone in the family can be honored.  I<br/>\nalso think it is important to honor ourselves in situations like this too.<br/>\nShe clearly is feeling anxious about the neighborhood kids bombarding their<br/>\nhouse again this summer, and if she just keeps allowing it and let&#39;s the<br/>\nresentment build up, I am certain it will bleed into her relationships with<br/>\nher family members in ways that she may/may not recognize.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I believe she *can *consider her children&#39;s feelings while exploring her<br/>\nown feelings and come up with something as a family that will be creative<br/>\nand help this situation out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally get hung up with the word &quot;should&quot;.

Maybe<br/>\n&gt; once a week you can treat them to dinner at your house - homemade pizzas or<br/>\n&gt; something really cool that they may not get at their own homes, something<br/>\n&gt; they can look forward to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===I also feel resentful at the parents themselves, who seem not to care<br/>\n&gt; that their kids would rather be at our house than theirs===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we were kids, both of my parents worked all day. They owned a business<br/>\n&gt; that was located at the far end of our street, so they were physically<br/>\n&gt; nearby, but they didn&#39;t come home for lunch or anything liek that. We were<br/>\n&gt; on our own during the summers. My neighbor friends&#39; moms were SAHMs, so<br/>\n&gt; there were always several moms at home most days. Even though we had a pool,<br/>\n&gt; we couldn&#39;t swim at our house without an adult at home and there wasn&#39;t an<br/>\n&gt; adult at home during the day. But a friend who lived on the same street also<br/>\n&gt; had a pool and her mom was nearly always home during the day, so the whole<br/>\n&gt; gang of kids on our street often ended up swimming at that friend&#39;s house.<br/>\n&gt; Another friend&#39;s family had board games, a trampoline, and a small fort of<br/>\n&gt; sorts in the backyard. Those hours were more fun to be at when I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; hang out with my friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think my mom didn&#39;t care that we would rather be at someone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; house, rather it was more that her focus was elsewhere (running a business).<br/>\n&gt; She grew up in an environment in which everyone pretty much was on their own<br/>\n&gt; with no real parental guidance or support or input, so setting up a house to<br/>\n&gt; be kid-friendly and inviting to neighbor kids wasn&#39;t in her skillset. The<br/>\n&gt; few times when friends would be over, my mom and stepdad would be segregated<br/>\n&gt; off into their bedroom and us kids would be on our own -- it didn&#39;t create<br/>\n&gt; that kind of welcoming environment I&#39;d feel when at my friends&#39; houses where<br/>\n&gt; their moms would be visible and available and involved to some extent with<br/>\n&gt; us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, it may not be that the kids&#39; parents don&#39;t care their kids would rather<br/>\n&gt; be at your house than their own, maybe it&#39;s that the parents don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; skills to create the kind of home that is the house at which all the kids<br/>\n&gt; want to gather. Maybe it&#39;s a relief for them to know their kids have a safe<br/>\n&gt; place to be, someplace where they&#39;re able to be with other kids rather than<br/>\n&gt; bored at home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===I guess I&#39;m feeling a bit spent after a week of hosting these 3<br/>\n&gt; children===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But you&#39;re not obligated to host them to the point of being worn out, nor<br/>\n&gt; should you feel like a babysitter.

I love your suggestions and ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is the most kid-friendly house with lots of stuff for the kids to do, whereas if they happen to go to one of the other houses where there isn&#39;t much to do, they end up right back at our house within a 1/2 hour.  I like that my children are the most comfortable here at our house as well, and for the most part wouldn&#39;t want them hanging out at 2 of the neighbors due to the reasons I stated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the idea of having them over for dinner on occasion, they would all love it!  We have had the girl next door over for dinner on quite a few occasions due to her parents being unavailable (usually partying).  I also like that the two kids have a sort of &quot;safe haven&quot; if you will at our house to feel respected and listened to and the one has expressed on more than one occasion that she wished she lived with us:(<br/>\n<br/>\nMy post came on the heels of this being the last week before summer break for these kids, and I know their just happy and excited and feeling free to actually play in larger blocks of time, whereas during the school year we hardly see them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think your right in saying that the parents might just not have the capacity or skill set to set up a kid-friendly house.  I do get lots of &quot;thank you&#39;s&quot; from two of the 3 sets of parents, so I know their appreciative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m definitely going to talk to my own kids and see if we can all agree on some boundaries in regards to the amount of time spent here.  My older son sometimes gets tired of playing after awhile and will go do his own thing, but he still wants the friends to stay.  I think he knows how much they like being here and doesn&#39;t want to send them home even when he&#39;s had enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again:)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie v.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===I&#39;m wishing for at least a couple or few whole days with just our family and no one else.===<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s perfectly okay to tell them, &quot;tomorrow we have plans so don&#39;t come over, but we&#39;ll be glad for you to come over the day after&quot;.

But a friend who lived on the same street also had a pool and her mom was nearly always home during the day, so the whole gang of kids on our street often ended up swimming at that friend&#39;s house.

We have 3 neighbor children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1672782793\">I wanted to get some opinions on handling our neighbor situation now that school is out (out officially tomorrow where we live).  We have 3 neighbor children from 3 separate houses that play at our house regularly.  The kids rarely if ever go to another house to play, and from what I&#39;ve observed, there&#39;s a few different reasons for that.  There is also some weird dynamics at two of the neighbor houses which I think propel two of the children over here (alcoholism at one and just plain meanness at the other).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love having these kids over, for the most part, and all the kids get along great with my own two boys (ages range from 4-10), and my two boys usually want these kids over to play.  Right now they are spending approx. 3-4 hours a day here, and on the weekends it&#39;s more, and school gets out this friday, so I&#39;m guessing they will start coming over earlier due to that.  I&#39;m wishing for at least a couple or few whole days with just our family and no one else.  Also my husband works long hours and when he gets home these kids are here and I feel like it cuts into my boys time with him, which is only a few hours in the evening and on weekends.  Another thing that has cropped up is that when the kids are here, their hungry and I can&#39;t afford to be feeding 3 extra kids for a good part of the week.  I don&#39;t mind setting out snacks now and again, and when my own boys are hungry (which isn&#39;t at most people&#39;s prescribed meal times) then they ask for, or get food and when the neighbor kids are here they partake or ask for meals too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel resentful at the parents themselves, who seem not to care that their kids would rather be at our house than theirs, even though right now their in school all day and they never see them except for on the evenings and weekends, and that&#39;s when their over here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m feeling a bit spent after a week of hosting these 3 children, with the buildup of school getting out tomorrow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas for helping things go smooth this summer?  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie v.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54486,"nextTopicId":54682}}
