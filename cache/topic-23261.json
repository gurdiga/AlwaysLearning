That&#39;s a big <br/>\ndrag for me, as quite a bit of mail can bounce in that much time.    Please, if <br/>\nyou send me something and it bounced, send it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn evil e-mailing program used my address last night to send out over 900 <br/>\ncopies of an e-mail called &quot;please do this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you didn&#39;t get one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you got one, I&#39;m sorry; I hope you didn&#39;t open it.   It&#39;s a website <br/>\nclaiming to be about t-shirts, but it&#39;s just an e-mail collecting thing.   If you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t opened that e-mail, GOOD.   Just delete it.    I didn&#39;t send it but it <br/>\nsurely clearly LOOKS like it did, because that&#39;s something their ugly program <br/>\ncan do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you opened it and didn&#39;t go to the webpage, GOOD.   Then it&#39;s not likely <br/>\nto happen to you.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for the trouble, but when people DO get that &quot;please do this&quot; it <br/>\nnever really comes from the person it seems to have come from (which seems to be <br/>\nalways someone whose e-mail that person recognizes).    There ought to be a <br/>\nlaw. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23260,"nextTopicId":23030}}
