Logging the hours was so <br/>\nnerve wracking, I finally just let my 14 yo drive to the country store around <br/>\nthe corner by himself every day for a while.  (We lived out in the <br/>\nsemi-boonies at that time.)  It worked.  He learned to relax a lot, and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get constipated, either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned how to drive when I was 13, in an old red VW Bug that had been our <br/>\nfamily car.  We, too, lived out in the boonies, where my uncle was the <br/>\nconstable.  His daughter, and both of us 13 and unlicensed, I drove all over <br/>\nour little town and I learned a lot.  Of course, we could also drive <br/>\ntractors!  So when it came time for the driving test, I wasn&#39;t nervous or <br/>\nanything...just drove like I had been for the last 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think every kid should learn how to drive a stick.  My future <br/>\ndaughter-in-law can&#39;t drive a stick and that&#39;s just SHAMEFUL!

I could have done it at 14 and 9 months, because <br/>\nI was an *honor student* (read that with the proper sing-song voice), but I <br/>\nwas also not in driver&#39;s ed until summer, when I turned 15 anyway.  In those <br/>\ndays, any 16 year old could get a learner&#39;s permit and learn on his own, but <br/>\nif you were younger than 16 you had to take driver&#39;s ed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut laws change, and the current deal in New Mexico is NOBODY younger than 18 <br/>\ncan get a license without drivers&#39; ed.  Nobody can get a learner&#39;s permit <br/>\nwithout being enrolled in an approved driver&#39;s ed course.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the two-tiered licensing system.  The learner&#39;s permit requires <br/>\nfifty hours with a licensed driver (various will do) who is over 18 and has <br/>\nhad a license for at least three years.  There&#39;s a little folder in which the <br/>\ndrivers initial.  Ten of those hours have to be at night.  They also have to <br/>\ndrive with the driving instructor for (I think) five hours (maybe three, or <br/>\nmaybe three sessions shorter than an hour?) but that&#39;s after they finish the <br/>\ncourse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all that they can get a provisional license.<br/>\n<br/>\nProvisional has to be used for at least six months.  Or rather, they can&#39;t go <br/>\nto a full license unless they have been free of citations for six months.  So <br/>\na provisional could last until a kid was 18 if he gets a ticket each six <br/>\nmonths.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring provisional days, they can&#39;t drive after midnight, can only have one <br/>\nminor person in the car who is not a family member.  So a teen can drive one <br/>\nother teen, or someone else&#39;s sister or brother, but can&#39;t take a teen friend <br/>\nand that friend&#39;s sibling,arty the one mile to Active Imagination.  So Kirby <br/>\nwill be able to take his girlfriend out alone, but couldn&#39;t legally take her <br/>\nAND her teenaged brother who has been their best chaperone.   The purpose is <br/>\nto keep gangs of kids from cruising.  But the practical limitations mean it <br/>\ncreates single-couple dates, instead of a group of friends or a double date <br/>\nsituation.   I&#39;m not crazy about that.  Not so much about Kirby himself, but <br/>\nin general, for a girl who would rather NOT be alone with a guy, but the <br/>\nstate says he can only take ONE person in his car who&#39;s not related to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, unless a kid needs a full license as part of a job <br/>\nrequirement, keeping a provisional a long time isn&#39;t much problem (unless <br/>\nthere&#39;s something about it I don&#39;t know), especially for Kirby who will turn <br/>\n17 this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] First day of school for Kirby","postDate":"1047784948","msgId":12887,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3My4xNzJkNDgwYy4yYmE1NDdmNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12886,"nextInTopic":12888,"prevInTime":12886,"nextInTime":12888,"topicId":12858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/15/03 7:40:31 PM, lucie.caunter@sympatico.ca writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1678263992\">In a message dated 3/15/03 7:40:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucie.caunter@...\">lucie.caunter@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t suppose insurance would give us group discount?

No <br/>\npressure from school friends, no big hurry. And he&#39;s busy four afternoons a <br/>\nweek, with karate and working at the gaming shop, and after school hours are <br/>\nthe regular driver&#39;s ed times here.  The public schools in Albuquerque don&#39;t <br/>\nteach driver&#39;s ed, it&#39;s all done through private schools, but the schools <br/>\ncater to school kids so there aren&#39;t morning classes, and Kirby isn&#39;t allowed <br/>\ninto the adult classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo soon our insurance will go up (way up) and I&#39;ll start sharing my van.  <br/>\nKeith has talked about buying a third car every day for over a week, talked <br/>\nwith each kid, looked at what the credit union is offering in way of <br/>\nre-possession, and last night he had a bad car-buying dream.  Poor Keith.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Kirby will be a really good driver, because he&#39;s totally <br/>\nrules-conscious and cautious.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12968,"nextTopicId":12980}}
