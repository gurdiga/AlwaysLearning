I&#39;m working to shift my perspective  <br/>\nabout this.  What are the natural consequences of stealing if you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t get caught? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes you a thief.  I shoplifted some when I was a teen.  I still  <br/>\nfeel guilty.  I didn&#39;t get caught.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t necessarily make you a thief for life.  I don&#39;t steal  <br/>\nANYthing from anybody, and haven&#39;t since I shoplifted a George  <br/>\nHarrison 45 rpm record from Penney&#39;s at Winrock mall in Albuquerque  <br/>\nin 1970.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the deal:  Had I been caught, I might&#39;ve been arrested, or  <br/>\nmaybe just scared straight by the mall security guys.<br/>\nIn your own case, you could be kept from unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been many things my kids did that could have resulted in  <br/>\nexposure to the county child welfare people.  I did NOT want to lose  <br/>\nour right to unschooling, and it&#39;s fragile.

Depending on personalities and  <br/>\nrelationships, that could be good or bad. It might make the cousin  <br/>\nmad at your daughter.
