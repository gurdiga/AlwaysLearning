He used <br/>\n&gt; blocks, cards, and other devices designed so anyone learned as they <br/>\n&gt; played.   Today everyone seems to be playing computer games.  It seems <br/>\n&gt; only natural the one learns while playing.  It seems only sensible <br/>\n&gt; that we design computer games from which the player learns. There is a <br/>\n&gt; lot on the internet on this topic.  But I can&#39;t find a directory  or <br/>\n&gt; other listing that rates games by their learning excellence.  I would <br/>\n&gt; like to mention a couple of the best computer games for learning in my <br/>\n&gt; book &quot;A Gaian Paradgm.&quot;  May I ask members of this list to send me <br/>\n&gt; their nominations for all 5 star learning computer games, that you <br/>\n&gt; have used or are familiar with,  rated by excellence for learning and <br/>\n&gt; by age group (preschools through college to senior citizens ). .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for you help.<br/>\n&gt; Bill Ellis<br/>\n&gt;      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AGaianParadigm/files/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AGaianParadigm/files/</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32075,"nextTopicId":32072}}
