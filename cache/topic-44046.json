I mean if a person just fakes a smile, will that  <br/>\nimprove marriages?   I&#39;ve heard (and don&#39;t know) that forcing a smile  <br/>\nchanges mood.  And there&#39;s not much difference between the look of  <br/>\nabout to cry and the look of giggling, sometimes (not always, but  <br/>\nthere is a crying that looks like laughing).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my guess:  there are glands all around our faces with which we  <br/>\ncan affect things scientists don&#39;t know about.   The same way dogs wag  <br/>\ntheir tails to broadcast an information-providing scent, or stick the  <br/>\ntail between their legs to hide a scent.  I think people who aren&#39;t  <br/>\npowdered and perfumed would (do) exude information/signals.  And I  <br/>\nthink this might be THE most hidden/taboo area of instinct in the  <br/>\nwestern world (and probably other cultures that use scent-masking  <br/>\nperfumy stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to the other...<br/>\nI went through a time when I was 30ish when I was probably clinically  <br/>\ndepressed and didn&#39;t know it.  I pulled myself back out of it with  <br/>\nthought and effort.  But during that time a friend of mine told me she  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hang around with me because I was too negative.   I&#39;ve  <br/>\nnever forgotten that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery two or three years since, I&#39;ve had a down cycle, which has a  <br/>\ncouple of times turned to depression for which I went to my favorite  <br/>\ncounsellor and talked, and then to my whichever&#39;s on call doctor, and  <br/>\ngot anti-depressants.   I don&#39;t live there.  And if the down cycle  <br/>\ncomes while I&#39;m mentally strong and alert, I can keep myself  <br/>\nfunctional and cheery, but during those times I avoid my friends  <br/>\npartly so that I don&#39;t depress them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually I&#39;m zippy and funny and energetic.   Feeling what that feels  <br/>\nlike helps me induce it later.  And I&#39;m wondering if laughing and  <br/>\nsinging (which I consciously do when I want to lift my mood) are  <br/>\nphysically hooked in to biochemicals that cheer moods.  And maybe it  <br/>\nhas to do with stretching certain parts of the facial skin and muscles  <br/>\nwhich affect something... blood flow or teensy glands or secretions  <br/>\nwithin cells or whatnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the frowning thing is why people don&#39;t get better in mental  <br/>\nhospitals; they often get worse.  Like prison, if a minor offender  <br/>\ngoes, he can come out a pissed off major offender.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Families in which more than one language is spoken","postDate":"1239771205","msgId":44048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4NzE5OS42Mjg3NC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDBGMUUwQTM5LTNCNTMtNEU3Ni1CNDBGLTcyRjNEMjI0QkQ5OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDBGMUUwQTM5LTNCNTMtNEU3Ni1CNDBGLTcyRjNEMjI0QkQ5OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44047,"nextInTopic":44052,"prevInTime":44047,"nextInTime":44049,"topicId":44046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I will try to be there let me know what time.
