Before we even considered moving to a place with more land, we all discussed that this was my passion.  During that conversation, Dave said that he was willing to help with odd building, lifting, guy-stuff, etc. (to support my passion) but that he wanted no part in any daily grind.   Sorscha said that she might help, but probably not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have kept that initial conversation in mind whenever I make choices about this particular aspect of our lifestyle.  If I can&#39;t do it or take care of it ALONE, then I don&#39;t add it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for traveling, Dave agreed that when Sorscha and I are away that he would also need to be able to take care of everything on his own  another factor that I consider in my choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother consideration is that Sorscha is an only child.  I know that the majority of the daily grind part needs to take place before she wakes up in the morning or once Dave is home.  I tend to do my canning and processing on the weekends so that she continues to have my full attention.  And no, she does not have any desires to piddle around in the kitchen with me - Though she does enjoy crawling like an animal around the garden and taking bites out of produce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like that both Dave & Sorscha enjoy our lifestyle and its benefits.  Because of our initial conversation regarding my passion and them setting their boundaries, we have created a great life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal in New Mexico</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: farmer/gardener/&quot;green choices&quot;","postDate":"1272646709","msgId":53654,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyZjI3bCtrbzFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCREE0MTI2LjgwMDAxMDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":53640,"nextInTopic":53670,"prevInTime":53653,"nextInTime":53655,"topicId":53594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

People don&#39;t understand that you can disagree and still get along. Not everyone has to think the same as you do. We automatically expect others to think and do the way we do. I think that is an instinctive survival tool. If you agree with others in a group, you are more likely to be accepted, provided for and protected. So if the family is part of some group, church, community, clan, their children will be safer if they agree with the others in the group. If they disagree, they risk being rejected and ostracized.

And we<br/>\nunschool.  And we (gasp) shop at Wal-Mart, drink soda, eat candy and sweets,<br/>\nand we are fairly big fans of McDonald&#39;s -- which puts us at odds with a LOT<br/>\nof our fellow growers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to our *philosophy* or our reasons for doing what we do, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t fit the mold, I don&#39;t think.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimarily, we do what we do so that we can be together as a family.  As much<br/>\nas possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe spend a lot of time talking about other reasons that we grow things, and<br/>\nwe do avoid killer pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and we make efforts<br/>\nto use *sustainable* growing practices -- but you can really get into some<br/>\ngood hair-splitting conversations about such things.  So much so that we<br/>\ndon&#39;t out and out subscribe to any one *rule* about the way we grow.  Nor do<br/>\nwe shun the *big, bad corporations* that are often vilified by those around<br/>\nus.  We do what we do so we can be together.  And we like growing stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of our fellow growers do it for political or ideological principles --<br/>\nthey believe whole-heartedly in certain food practices and health and<br/>\nenvironmental ideas, and they shun those who don&#39;t toe the line.  It&#39;s VERY<br/>\ntaboo in the circles where we spend most of our time to be seen with a<br/>\ncoffee cup from McDonald&#39;s, or a bag from Wal-Mart.  I know that we get *tsk<br/>\ntsk* for my husband&#39;s addiction to Coca Cola (he almost always has a can<br/>\nsitting behind him when he&#39;s selling at farmer&#39;s markets).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for our kids&#39; involvement, we don&#39;t require them to help, although we<br/>\noffer them opportunities to earn money on the farm, the same way we offer<br/>\nother employees opportunities to do so.  And the same as it is in the house<br/>\n-- like, hey would you mind helping me clear the table? -- it&#39;s the same on<br/>\nthe farm -- hey, would you guys mind helping move some of these plants into<br/>\nthe greenhouse with us?  It&#39;s supposed to get cold tonight. (Etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also don&#39;t force any opinions about what&#39;s right or wrong environmentally<br/>\non anyone -- not our customers, not our friends, not our employees, not our<br/>\nkids.  We don&#39;t limit sweets or sodas or *junk food.*  We also happen to<br/>\nhave times when we have so much spinach in the field that we&#39;re putting<br/>\nspinach in every recipe we can think of.  It&#39;s kind of a game with us -- and<br/>\nwe laugh about it, and the kids sometimes enjoy it and eat it, and sometimes<br/>\nthey don&#39;t.  I think we are pretty even-keeled and we remain open to<br/>\nquestions about what is *good* for the earth or what is *healthy* for<br/>\nhumans.  My husband, who is one hell of a grower, meets every claim about<br/>\nhealth, sustainability, and the environment with lots of skepticism, and, I<br/>\nthink, a scientist&#39;s mind.  I have become much more skeptical about such<br/>\nclaims as well.  We have had some pretty interesting conversations about<br/>\nwhat is *right* and what is *wrong.*  There&#39;s definitely a popular mind-set<br/>\nat the markets and among other growers about how things should be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we treat it the same as we treat anything else.  We are not<br/>\nregistered members of any political party; we just aren&#39;t ideologues (is<br/>\nthat the word?) -- we do lots of research and take a long time to make up<br/>\nour minds, on almost every topic.  And our kids see us going through those<br/>\nthought processes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard not to *use* the farm as a place for learning, but we try to let<br/>\nit happen naturally.  Julian, our 9-year-old, was helping pull up tomato<br/>\nstakes a couple days ago with this little device we have -- it&#39;s a simple<br/>\nmachine, using a lever, and it makes it easy for anybody to pull up the<br/>\nstakes.  Those stakes are otherwise impossible to get out of the ground.<br/>\nSo, we did an impromptu *lesson* on leverage and why the device makes it<br/>\npossible for us to easily pull up the stakes.  He was interested.  He ended<br/>\nup  looking up some stuff online about levers, and he went around trying to<br/>\nfind stuff that was too heavy for him to lift, and then using sticks and<br/>\nshovels and whatnot, balanced on a rock or something as a fulcrum, to see if<br/>\nit was easier to lift them.  I love that kind of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have always loved growing things -- that&#39;s what brought us<br/>\ntogether.  He lived for awhile in I guess what you might call a more<br/>\nmainstream situation, married to his first wife, working a fairly lucrative<br/>\n9-5 job, after getting all the *important* higher education that was<br/>\nexpected of him.  He was miserable, and spent his evenings growing things.<br/>\nI lived for awhile in that mainstream world, too, getting lots and lots of<br/>\neducation, seeking a *legitimate* living in an office, believing that one<br/>\nday I&#39;d get the time and space to grow stuff in my free time.  Each of us,<br/>\nmy hubby and I, experienced separately something fairly significant and<br/>\nshattering -- I got cancer in 2003, before I knew him.  He got dumped by his<br/>\nwife, who was cheating on him, around that same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have taken my cancer diagnosis and become a major health nut,<br/>\ndetermining that because I had eaten so much sugar in my life, or consumed<br/>\nthis or that, or breathed this or that, that&#39;s why I got cancer (and I did<br/>\nspend some time in that pursuit) -- but the truth is, I do not know.<br/>\nDoctors do not know.  Nobody knows.  And probably won&#39;t ever.  Thankfully, I<br/>\ngot better after chemo and surgery and stuff.  My husband could have taken<br/>\nthe loss of his family life as a reason to work harder, or get religious, or<br/>\nbecome a zealot about working out at the gym, or make some other equally<br/>\nextreme decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, he and I both -- still not knowing each other -- decided to pursue<br/>\nthings that we loved.  Growing things, and family.  I sought out a partner<br/>\nwho was looking for the same thing.  We actually met online, and shortly<br/>\nthereafter we were building compost piles together and planting beans.  Now,<br/>\nfour years later, we have a full-fledged business, his two kids from his<br/>\nfirst marriage, our baby girl, another one on the way, and a fridge that has<br/>\ncoca cola and chemical-free bok choi in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of that back story may seem irrelevant, but I think it explains<br/>\na lot about why we do what we do -- it&#39;s a lot more about living life<br/>\ntogether with your family, and not losing that precious time -- not so much<br/>\nabout fulfilling some ideological principle.  Which is why I will keep<br/>\ndrinking my McDonald&#39;s coffee (even though I do sometimes hide the cup when<br/>\nI go to market).  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] farmer/gardener/&quot;green choices&quot;","postDate":"1272549796","msgId":53598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRDk5MUE0LjkwOTAwMDlAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwNkNDMDlCLTEzNTQtNEMyNi05RUMxLUNENEFCNUMxRTA3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQwNkNDMDlCLTEzNTQtNEMyNi05RUMxLUNENEFCNUMxRTA3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53594,"nextInTopic":53605,"prevInTime":53597,"nextInTime":53599,"topicId":53594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Yes, I&#39;m pretty well-versed <br/>\nand immersed in the whole peak oil argument and have lots of thoughts on <br/>\nthat, which are outside the scope of unschooling discussion (but I&#39;ve <br/>\nwritten lots about it at my farm blog: touchtheearthfarm.blogspot.com ). <br/>\nThat said, however, what I&#39;ve found to work best in my life is to <br/>\nembrace my principles as *personal* principles and to live them in ways <br/>\nthat impact my kids&#39; lives in positive ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on the matter is that if I want them to adopt my principles, and <br/>\nI&#39;m not entirely sure I do, then the best way for that to happen is for <br/>\nmy kids to associate those principles with comfort and joy, not guilt, <br/>\nfear, shame, or coercion. I can step back and realize that I got to my <br/>\ncurrent mode of thinking from a pretty conventional upbringing--if my <br/>\njourney brought me here, then surely my kids can choose whatever life <br/>\npath works for them and *perhaps* also get to this place of viewing the <br/>\nworld. Perhaps not, and that&#39;s okay with me too because one of my <br/>\npersonal principles is that each person gets to choose his/ her own life <br/>\npath.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways to live one&#39;s own principles without imposing <br/>\nthem on others, and there are lots of ways to remain open to other <br/>\npoints of view. I may not choose to hunt, but I can see the value of <br/>\nthat for other people, my children included. I can listen <br/>\nenthusiastically and do what I can to support my kids&#39; exploration of <br/>\ntheir own values and interests without compromising what matters to <br/>\nme--there&#39;s a separation there that&#39;s key, in my opinion. Being able to <br/>\nview the world through their eyes and not just my own is a way to foster <br/>\nconnection; insisting others adopt my view is a pretty good way to <br/>\nfoster disconnection and conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is a journey, and we&#39;re constantly in the process of trying things, <br/>\nstepping back to consider what&#39;s working for *all* of us and what&#39;s not, <br/>\nand tweaking things to find solutions that meet *all* of our needs. My <br/>\nkids love living on the farm because for them it&#39;s a source of joy, <br/>\ninterest, and delicious food. We&#39;re also finding that it&#39;s a source of <br/>\ndissatisfaction in terms of vacationing and my husband&#39;s commute, and <br/>\nthose are problems we&#39;re working to address. Once the farm becomes a <br/>\ndrag on any one of us, it ceases to be the nurturing environment *I* <br/>\nwant it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done a pretty good job of creating a space where the kids can come <br/>\nand go as they please, enjoy what they love about it and leave what they <br/>\ndon&#39;t. The trick for me has been to find ways to embrace and live my <br/>\nvalues... to *own* them... without foisting them on those I love. That <br/>\nhas often created more work for me, and I&#39;ve found reminding myself that <br/>\nwork is something I *chose* because of the lifestyle I wanted to live... <br/>\nreminding myself that in doing that work I am meeting my own needs... is <br/>\ncrucially important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically it boils down to the fact that I don&#39;t figure I&#39;m making this <br/>\nworld a better place by sowing disharmony and conflict no matter how <br/>\nmany confinement animals I don&#39;t eat or how much I reduce my carbon <br/>\nfootprint. There are lots of ways to try to make the world a better <br/>\nplace and I try to do that by acting within my direct sphere of <br/>\ninfluence--my family--by keeping our focus on joy and connected <br/>\nrelationships: local action at its finest, in my not so humble opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (12), Julia (11), Sam (9)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"farmer/gardener/&quot;green choices&quot;","postDate":"1272539838","msgId":53594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNkNDMDlCLTEzNTQtNEMyNi05RUMxLUNENEFCNUMxRTA3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":53598,"prevInTime":53593,"nextInTime":53595,"topicId":53594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My first ideas are below, but I need help with this one: Sandra, i wrote this to our local group to someone asking about food issues (i gave her your site","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1584552112\">My first ideas are below, but I need help with this one:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\ni wrote this to our local group to someone asking about food issues (i  <br/>\ngave her your site links): &quot; I&quot;m going to write to our group about  <br/>\nunschooling families who manage farms but who do not mandate chores or  <br/>\ndo not demand green choices from children, seperately.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave Alex&#39;s example.
