There was no  <br/>\nmiddle man, no &#39;site,&#39; no one else to take responsibility or be a part  <br/>\nof the negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone knows the parents or the teen and invites them to stay and  <br/>\noffers them some compensation, there is much less legal liability  <br/>\ninvolved than if any third party brokers the deal, and more than if it  <br/>\nis officially like a hiring situation.   I do worry about legal  <br/>\nliability in cases where the host family knows no one in that other  <br/>\nfamily personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be totally negative on the idea of a match-up site,  <br/>\nbut I&#39;m interested in examining it in light of unschooling (as it was  <br/>\nsent to this list and all).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This is an amazing experience for both the families and the au  <br/>\npairs. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the possibility for an amazing opportunity.<br/>\nThe experience isn&#39;t guaranteed to be amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes teens are moody.  There&#39;s the possibility that something  <br/>\nabout the climate or environment won&#39;t be ideal for that person.  The  <br/>\nteen might get homesick.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile unschooling is a small community, it&#39;s fairly easy to find  <br/>\npeople through other people.  This seems a jump, though, to me.  And a  <br/>\nteen might say &quot;I want to do that!&quot; while other teens and adults would  <br/>\nbe shaking their heads and thinking (or saying) bad idea.  Not all  <br/>\nteens are Holly.  Some are probably much swifter and better suited to  <br/>\nsuch a deal than Holly, but it&#39;s hard to know.  I would hate to be  <br/>\nasked to endorse someone and gamble my reputation to her suitability,  <br/>\nand I wouldn&#39;t want to risk the friendship with the parents by saying,  <br/>\n&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so; I wouldn&#39;t trust her.&quot;  Eeek.   I would hate  <br/>\nvery much to be put in a position to need to &quot;certify&quot; teens as  <br/>\nqualified for this, nor to see anyone else put herself in a position  <br/>\nto be certifying or rejecting.  Speak of tests!!! yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to having them as unschooling consultants, it&#39;s hard enough for  <br/>\nsome adults to explain unschooling, and to expect a teen to explain it  <br/>\nto a family clearly is a lot to require.   Kids who grew up with it  <br/>\nmight not be analytical enough to explain it, nor brave enough to  <br/>\nobject to parental practices.  I&#39;ve been asked directly, &quot;SO!  What do  <br/>\nyou think?&quot; about someone&#39;s parenting, and it&#39;s not comfortable for me  <br/>\nto say &quot;There are some glaring problems, if you really want to be a  <br/>\ngood unschooler.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother potential problem is the normal opportunity for a kid to bail  <br/>\nout on a decision.  Professional au pairs are unlikely to decide  <br/>\nagainst it a week and a half in, but if an unschooler isn&#39;t  <br/>\ncomfortable, and wants to go home, will that &quot;ruin her reputation&quot; or  <br/>\nprevent her from staying with a family with whom she&#39;s more comfortable?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another thought, about unschooling and learning.  If a family  <br/>\nwants an au pair to keep confidences (as some family/servant  <br/>\nrelationships traditionally do), that would be a problem for me.   <br/>\nTelling a teen not to discuss what they have done and seen seems  <br/>\npotentially dangerous to me.  But I also wouldn&#39;t want a teen going  <br/>\naway and telling stories that could harm the ability of that family to  <br/>\nget a replacement teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt runs the danger of the teens being &quot;certifying&quot; the parents, or  <br/>\ncovering for them.  I neither want to certify nor cover for anyone.  I  <br/>\nthink things should be kept on a friendly basis, and not turn  <br/>\nprofessional.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere IS potential for it to be wonderful, if it&#39;s handled gently and  <br/>\nnaturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":451410015,"authorName":"jennamiller622","from":"&quot;jennamiller622&quot; &lt;jennamiller622@...&gt;","profile":"jennamiller622","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Become an Au Pair or host one!

We then send the family the potential matches we recieve and they can then contact the au pairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an amazing experience for both the families and the au pairs. The families have the opportunity to learn from the au pairs and their past experiences with unschooling while the au pairs get to travel, live in a new city (or country!), and have a new life adventure!
