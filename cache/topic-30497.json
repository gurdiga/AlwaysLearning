She has been out of<br/>\nschool since February.  Last week would have been her first day of<br/>\nhigh school and instead we are planning for camp.  Yipee!  Going to<br/>\ncamp is such an accomplishment for her.  When I first asked her<br/>\nabout it she had not slept away from home in years due to anxiety.<br/>\nWe began treatment before she left school and she was still not sure<br/>\nif she could do it.  After e-mailing Grace, talking to some kids and<br/>\nparents and deciding my mom and I would stay in VT while she was<br/>\nthere she agreed to try it.  Since then she was able to stay one of<br/>\ntwo nights at youth group camp, spent three nights with my sister<br/>\n(planned for 2 then asked to stay another night)and three nights<br/>\nwith her god mother in another state.  She is still really nervous<br/>\nabout going but I know she&#39;ll be ok.  SHe started talking about<br/>\nbeing eaten by a moose but I know she&#39;s worried about getting along<br/>\nwith the other kids.  I&#39;m not worried even a teensie bit though.  I<br/>\nplan on having a lovely vacation and then hearing about all her<br/>\nadventures.  I am hoping meeting other unschooling teens will help<br/>\nher find some motivation and inspire her.  SHe is still struggling<br/>\nwith being self directed after so many years in school.  I am<br/>\nstruggling with being supportive without pushing her.<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nTell them all to look for Cameron Lovejoy. He&#39;s been for several years <br/>\nnow and is ALWAYS wiling to make a new friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI PROMISE he&#39;ll give each one a GREAT BIG HUG! and will sit and chat <br/>\nthe hours away. He has a genuine interest in whatever you are <br/>\npassionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s easy to spot---skinny and soft-spoken with shoulder-length brown <br/>\nhair and a Shaggy (from Scooby-Doo) goatee. &lt;g&gt; And he&#39;ll most likely <br/>\nbe hugging someone!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s already driving north (spent the night in Northern VA) to Vermont.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.
