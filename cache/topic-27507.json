School and church <br/>\n&gt;come to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My son is definitely a child who would be labeled ADHD if he had more <br/>\nmainstream parents. When he was younger, the energy level was the <br/>\nthing that was most noticeable. Because we dont go to &quot;school and <br/>\nchurch&quot; its not necessary for him to sit still, or pay attention to <br/>\nthings he isnt interested in, so...not a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, i have noticed lately that the &quot;inattention&quot; part of the <br/>\nlabel has started to become really noticeable. For example, this past <br/>\nThanksgiving, i had made Seamus a plate of food, and set it down in <br/>\nfront of the chair that was by the window. I was going to sit right <br/>\nnext to him, and his aunt was right across the table. So far, neither <br/>\nof us had a plate of food. I told Seamus that i had his food at his <br/>\nplace, if he wanted to sit down, he comes over stands right next to me <br/>\nin front of his place, and says &quot;Where is it??? Where am i supposed to <br/>\nsit? Where&#39;s my food??&quot; His plate was the only plate on the table. It <br/>\nwas really obvious to everyone but him where to sit. We all started <br/>\nlaughing a bit because if someone tells you &quot;You&#39;re foods at the table <br/>\nwhere you&#39;ll be sitting&quot; and there is only one plate of food at the <br/>\ntable, and the seat is the one right next to your mother, the <br/>\nassumption can be made that, yep thats your spot. But he didnt make <br/>\nthat connection, and seemed bewildered that I would think he would. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother situation...I was on the computer, wanted to quote a passage <br/>\nfrom a book in a post i was writing, and asked Seamus to go get a book <br/>\nfrom the living room for me. Before i could even tell him what book or <br/>\nwhere it was at, he took off to get it. I called him back, told him <br/>\nvery specifically &quot;Bring me the book called Attaching In Adoption, <br/>\nwith the red cover, that is on the long white couch [as opposed to the <br/>\nloveseat]&quot; By the time he walked the few feet down the hall way, he <br/>\nwas saying &quot;What am i looking for? Whats it called? Where&#39;s it at???&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is looking for something, and it is literally right in front of <br/>\nhim, he can&#39;t see it. He&#39;ll yell at me &quot;Where is it?? I thought you <br/>\nsaid it was on the bed???&quot; This is especially true if he actually has <br/>\nto move something aside (his coat is under another coat or <br/>\nsomething)...He will be on his way to go do something (take a dish to <br/>\nthe sink)totally forget what he was doing, and go do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of stuff happens every day. Multiple times a day. My son <br/>\ntold him that sometimes he will want to remember his online friends&#39; <br/>\nnames, but forgets the name before he has a chance to write it down. <br/>\nSo i think its something he thinks about too. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this has anything to do with school, or sitting down, or being <br/>\nquiet. As his energy level has decreased over the years and he has <br/>\nmore control over his body, and is less likely to rage over seemingly <br/>\nsimple things I&#39;ve started to notice his forgetfullness, his <br/>\ndifficulty in finding items, and also his lack of coordination (he was <br/>\nwalking like Capt. Jack Sparrow in a store the other day, glass items <br/>\nall around! eek!) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile right now, none of this impacts his life in an overly negative <br/>\nway (I help him find things, try not to give him too many directions <br/>\nat once, expect that i will have to help, and stay near him if we are <br/>\nwalking near fragile stuff), i do wonder how it will impact his life <br/>\nin the future if it doesnt improve. Will he be ok driving a car, or <br/>\nnot &quot;see&quot; that the light has turned red or another car is coming? Will <br/>\nhe have to have multiple copies of his keys since he will likely lose <br/>\nthem all the time? Will he be like me, and drop out of college <br/>\nmultiple times, or put off paying bills until they are late (even <br/>\nthough you have the money, and the bill sitting right there, and you <br/>\nKNOW it needs to be paid)? Will he not put clean laundry away until <br/>\nits all over the floor and needs to be rewashed? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there must be a way to embrace your child&#39;s personality, and <br/>\nnot foist negative labels on them, while also acknowledging that a <br/>\ncertain personality type doesnt always fit in to the way we currently <br/>\nlive our lives. I think that for most parents, a diagnosis of ADHD <br/>\nquickly leads to medicating the &quot;disorder&quot;, and i am doubtful that one <br/>\ncan take a medication for a personality &quot;deficit&quot; and not have it <br/>\nchange other aspects of your personality (ones you DONT want to <br/>\nchange!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny experience with kids who have this type of personality, and how <br/>\nthey adjust as adults? Is there a way to help a child improve their <br/>\nmemory?

If I keep talking <br/>\nat her at this time, regardless of how worthy or important my <br/>\ninformation may seem to me, the result is less connection and her eyes <br/>\nglazing over. So I might as well save my breath, and not foster this as <br/>\na habit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of answering questions, the simplest answer first and <br/>\nthen &quot;Does that help?&quot; as the invitation to ask more. Reminds me of a <br/>\njoke: The kid asked &quot;where did I come from?&quot; and got the whole story of <br/>\nthe birds and the bees. He listened patiently until the end then <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Johnny next door comes from Cleveland&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn interrupts a lot too - just boils and bubbles over with enthusiasm <br/>\nfor her new idea or what just happened.

I hope you are considering that the same might be the motivation for my post.  So much so that even though I knew that I might receive some spirited responses (despite my lack of time to respond to much of them), my empathy for parents of ADHDers (especially the more severe cases) prompted me to stick my neck out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By assuming that we have nothing more <br/>\n&gt; than an unreasonable bias against &quot;labels,&quot; you have blithely <br/>\n&gt; dismissed the very real and thoughtful reasons that we do not think <br/>\n&gt; it is a good idea to label a child as ADD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not say nor do I assume that such bias (and we all have our biases) is unreasonable.  People generally do have reasons for what they believe about ADHD.  What I am concerned about is that affected parents and their children may be missing out on information and help--help which, according to research, could save the lives of their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, ADHD is called a spectrum disorder, meaning that it can present in varying degrees.  Those with more severe cases of it are in more danger (from car accidents, the results of sexual promiscuity, etc.).  Some of us may have seen children who were labeled ADHD who either did not have it or had a mild version of it.  If we then conclude that it is not a real disorder and influence others accordingly, families of severely affected ADHDers may ignore important symptoms.  We certainly could think of the set of symptoms as having to do with genetic makeup and not being a *disorder*.  That would still leave us with the serious claim within most of the medical and pediatric community that such a group of symptoms can be dangerous to have and that steps can be taken to lessen the danger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, I am <br/>\n&gt; very careful NOT to label my children as ADD, or compulsive, or <br/>\n&gt; spirited, or explosive, or any other limiting label with such <br/>\n&gt; negative connotations, because I do feel that there are a myriad of <br/>\n&gt; potentially very negative consequences of that kind of labeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether to apply that label is certainly up to the parents, and I have heard of situations (parts of the country, among certain relatives, etc.) wherein I would probably not mention the term either.  I would still advocate parents educating *themselves* about ADHD if they are concerned about their child.  Then the parents are more empowered to make their own decision based upon input from a variety of sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt that I will have time to respond further until next year.

Yeah - just like everybody else, depending on THEIR  <br/>\nparticular personality traits. This particular bundle of traits is  <br/>\nconsidered problematic mostly because it is harder for people with  <br/>\nthese traits to function well in school-type situations (including  <br/>\nother-than-school situations that are similar in their behavioral  <br/>\nrequirements). Those of us with these traits can learn ways to do  <br/>\nbetter in those situations just like those with different sets of  <br/>\ntraits can learn to do better in situations that are more problematic  <br/>\nfor them. I did well in school - oddly - but now, looking back, I  <br/>\nrealize I had to shut down much of myself in order to function there.  <br/>\nIn order to sit still and follow directions and not interrupt and  <br/>\nwait my turn (none of which came easily to me), I also closed off the  <br/>\nparts of me that were most creative and interesting. I didn&#39;t even  <br/>\nKNOW it, usually, except for always having a deeply-in-the-background  <br/>\nsense of dread that I&#39;d be unacceptable if the real me was ever let  <br/>\nout. I really believe school causes problems for people with all  <br/>\nkinds of personalities, but those kids with personalities that are  <br/>\nquiet and still and compliant are &quot;easy&quot; and don&#39;t cause extra work  <br/>\nfor their parents and teachers and so they don&#39;t get &quot;diagnosed&quot; with  <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, many of these traits are extremely normal and healthy for  <br/>\nyounger children - it can take a long time for some kids to develop  <br/>\nthe ability to patiently wait their turn in a game or to wait for  <br/>\nsomeone to finish talking before blurting out responses. Some kids  <br/>\npick these kinds of things up quickly and seemingly automatically and  <br/>\nother kids take longer and sometimes need more direct help from the  <br/>\nadults around them. I don&#39;t need to diagnose a kid as ADD in order to  <br/>\nhelp a child come slowly over time to realize that (1) they really  <br/>\nhate waiting their turn so maybe playing games where they have to do  <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t the best use of their time and (2) if they want to play  <br/>\nthose games, part of the game is waiting so figure out how to be able  <br/>\nto do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTOO often, a diagnosis of ADD or ADHD harms a child because it lets  <br/>\nthe adults in that child&#39;s life off the hook for providing the best  <br/>\nenvironment for that child&#39;s temperament. Let&#39;s diagnose the  <br/>\nenvironment, instead, that isn&#39;t set up appropriately for children  <br/>\nwith certain kinds of personality traits - that doesn&#39;t support the  <br/>\nchild as he/she is, but labels the child&#39;s personality as a disorder  <br/>\n- bad, sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout the diagnosis, a child has behavior traits that will OFTEN  <br/>\nchange over time, anyway, and the child will do best with help from  <br/>\nparents who respond by setting up his/her environment supportively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have so many students who are overly passive and wait to be told  <br/>\nwhat to do and what to learn and they don&#39;t engage with the course  <br/>\ncontent, but simply repeat back what they&#39;ve been told.

I know of parents who so wish they had known about their children&#39;s ADHD when their children were still young.  They would have understood them (allowing more connection) much better.  My research has certainly helped me to understand and help my daughter, including finding a special diet that has ended her chronic headaches.  In fact, it was my understanding of ADHD that eventually led me to homeschooling and then to unschooling!

It felt like trying to communicate in &quot;sound bites&quot; (or is it <br/>\nbytes? I&#39;ve never been sure).

If I was using what I think of as my &quot;mommy voice&quot;-<br/>\n &quot;Shush!&quot; If I talk to her like a friend, I get to use more words.
