Dang.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And worse. Not only do many of us need to be nudged to do things we REALLY <br/>\nwant to do, sometimes we even LIKE someone else to organize our material for <br/>\nus - for learning something WE want to learn. I figured out how to make <br/>\ncandles of all kinds, on my own and by reading books and asking friends and <br/>\nexperimenting. But I signed up for a ceramics class and learned about it from <br/>\nsomeone I really respected and trusted and who organized the steps and gave <br/>\nme assignments to help me learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking about the scene in Karate Kid where his future sensei notices <br/>\nthe kid trying to learn Karate on his own, from a book. How much better for <br/>\nthe kid to have  a brilliant teacher to figure out what he needed to do to <br/>\nlearn what he wanted to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing for some of the things my kids want to learn (more so as they get <br/>\nolder)...sometimes they just want to investigate and talk and fool around and <br/>\npick up knowledge and information and skills as they happen, serendipitously <br/>\n-- but sometimes they want to learn from someone who gets the material <br/>\norganized for them in advance and gives it to them in a useful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPicking it up as it occurs in daily life is the BEST way to learn algebraic <br/>\nconcepts, but not the best way to learn all the rules and manipulations, <br/>\netc., that are algebraic methods. That&#39;s easier to learn (once the basic <br/>\nconcepts are internalized) by using material organized in a systematic way <br/>\nthat works for the individual - might mean using manipulatives, might be in a <br/>\nstory form, might be learned through &quot;investigations,&quot; etc. Just like it is <br/>\nNICE to have access to good materials that are well-organized, <br/>\nwell-thought-out, well-written, etc., it is also a great blessing to have <br/>\npeople in our lives like that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know &quot;not-unschooling&quot; when I see it &lt;G&gt; - it is not a parent or teacher <br/>\ndeciding what a kid should learn, when they should learn it, how they should <br/>\nlearn it, and IF they&#39;ve learned it (through testing or evaluating). But our <br/>\nunschooling lives change and grow and what seemed obvious when my kids were <br/>\nlittle is definitely not so obvious now.
