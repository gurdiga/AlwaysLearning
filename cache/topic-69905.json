I was hoping my husband can come up at least for a day. As a farmer he grew up with required chores and the farmer&#39;s working ethic talk. My kids have no required chores. My 6 year old loves it and will spend all day with dad from Spring till it gets too cold for her in the Fall. My son, 10 years old, will do it  occasionally,sometimes he will get into it , sometimes he is busy doing other things. He has been splitting some wood for me just because. <br/>\nWhen he does help out it is because he wants, or we really need him to help, and he does it willingly and does a great job. He does not cut corners or complain. He is a pretty cool kid. He is just very busy doing his own things in the computer.<br/>\n&#39;There is another local dad that I am not sure if he is going but the mom and the younger boys, 11 and 13, are going. They have met Sandra many years ago at a Conference in St Louis. The Dad had doubts   and questions and the Conference, specially listening to Sandra , really got him on board. I think Keith made a big impression in that family too.<br/>\nThere is yet another very sweet dad of young girls  in the State who is all for unschooling and he is a real nice guy. He would be a great dad to meet. I am hoping they will be there. They did come to a Unschooling Water Park get together I had years ago and I keep in touch with them all the time. They are super sweet and the girls are wonderful.<br/>\nThere is another dad who told me they want to come who;s kids are all into gaming and such . He seems like a great guy too. I met him in a local homeschooling event  a couple months ago. I know his wife and they are unschoolers. <br/>\nI know that for my husband it made a world of difference meeting dad&#39;s like David Waynforth and Ben Lovejoy in person.

When we can choose each time to do something, when we can decide what standards to maintain to be who we want to be, when we can decide whether we can continue to provide the standards we require of ourselves or if it&#39;s best passed onto someone else, it&#39;s easier to see how kids can grow into that naturally by having the ability to try things and decide if it&#39;s right for who they are today.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children&#39;s choices are judged against adult standards the kids will often fail. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we want isn&#39;t kids whose surface actions match their parents&#39; conscience but people who make choices according to their own conscience. To help kids conscience evolve and grow, feed it through your treatment of them: *be* kind, respectful, patient, helpful, understanding, supportive, trusting. Harshness, anger, disappointment tend to grow those same attitudes in others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Suggestions on peacefully fixing a parental error.","postDate":"1356262432","msgId":69951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBNkQyMTlBLUNENjgtNEZCMS05NTQ2LThGNDZFMEQ3NkYxOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtiNjRsOCtsY2FoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtiNjRsOCtsY2FoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69950,"nextInTopic":69954,"prevInTime":69950,"nextInTime":69952,"topicId":69905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m hoping my husband will come around more after he finishes your book.

Unschooling is a completely different lifestyle change for us and a much bigger concept than I could ever have managed to understand when I first came across Sandra&#39;s blog while looking for ways to teach a child that didn&#39;t want to be taught. I&#39;ve read her book, am starting on another, and I seek answers each day because I feel right with unschooling and its been a long road with a bipolar child to find something that feels right.  I&#39;m still fumbling along the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did give him the iPad, apologized, explained where we went wrong and thanked him for being a great big brother and helper. He&#39;s much happier and has spent the entire day playing and downloading apps. It took a bit for my husband to understand, however, because he felt he hadn&#39;t earned it. I sent him all of your responses as they came in and discussed it back and forth and back and forth. He still struggles with the unschooling concept because doesn&#39;t think the kids will learn responsibility. He&#39;s coming around though as he sees how little we struggle with the kids now. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy holidays to you and yours. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gocnagai&quot; &lt;gocnagai@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Long story short:<br/>\n&gt; We messed up and I&#39;m not sure how to fix it.

He lasted 1 week before quitting and not helping out at all the final 2 weeks. He did great the first week and it takes 2 weeks for Apple to ship the iPad so I ordered it.

It&#39;s a very possible roadblock in an unschooling family, I think. Not only because the child can be too young for a task and not realize it, but also because rewards can create a line of  &quot;what&#39;s in it for me&quot; and &quot;he/she owes me&quot; - thinking, instead of just naturally helping out eachother because it&#39;s a nice thing to do and it works both ways. Rewards often acts as manipulators, even when we don&#39;t intend them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo avoid situations like this in the future, I&#39;d work hard on eliminating the concept of rewarding from the family. Children will have plenty of occasions to experience *earning* things outside the house. You can keep the aquisition of things separate from helping.

I am new to it too, and at times, I find myself torn between the old way I parented, and this new way. Learning to trust your child to become a responsible person without using limitation, bribes, punishments, etc. is tough. You are going to mess up sometimes. It&#39;s alright to ask for advice from veteran unschoolers. No one can become an expert at unschooling overnight. If you do mess up, apologize. Tell your kid where you were coming from, but make sure to let him know you trust him and you&#39;re proud of his effforts. I think you are on the right track to building a good relationship with him. It helps me to think of how each situation makes my kids feel. I put myself in their shoes. I try to remember how loved a gift can make them feel. I say yes to every request they make, if it&#39;s within my (wallet) power. It surprises me that they understand if they ask for something and I<br/>\n don&#39;t have the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more piece of advice, I find that there are unschoolers out there who are quick to cut a newbie down. I find there are unschoolers who will be  very kind and supportive of your journey, and there are others who will belittle you for making a mistake. Listen to the postive people:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 22, 2012 12:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Suggestions on peacefully fixing a parental error.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-I&#39;ll end by saying that we didn&#39;t scold or belittle him when he didn&#39;t fulfill his agreement.
