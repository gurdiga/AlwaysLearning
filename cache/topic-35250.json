I&#39;m able to compete hard and enjoy the  <br/>\nresults - enjoy that momentary thrill of victory and despair of defeat  <br/>\n(the possibility of defeat has to exist or the thrill of victory  <br/>\nwon&#39;t). But I am mature and able to enjoy that moment and then let it  <br/>\ngo quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 17 yo, Rosie, is like this, too. She&#39;s a real competitor - she  <br/>\nplays soccer and she WANTS to win. But, she&#39;s a good sport, too. If  <br/>\nshe loses, she keeps her perspective and can look at the results  <br/>\nobjectively. She&#39;s very likely to say, &quot;THAT was a great game,&quot; when  <br/>\nher team has just lost, for example. The competition is important to  <br/>\nher - she enjoys it. Winning is the goal, but it isn&#39;t like THAT is  <br/>\nthe only source of joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re not a competitive person, you might not understand the fun  <br/>\nand satisfaction of it, but please don&#39;t make it into a personality  <br/>\nflaw or a moral failure. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy now-20 year old, Roxana,  could not handle competition very well  <br/>\nfor most of her life - even now it is maybe just a bit difficult for  <br/>\nher. She has a very very strong sense of fair play. Competition isn&#39;t  <br/>\nalways absolutely fair, and that element of it is very difficult for  <br/>\nher. If she was playing on a soccer team and the referee seemed to be  <br/>\nmaking some bad calls against her team, that would infuriate her and  <br/>\nlessen the joy of the competition. My 17 yo would brush it off as  <br/>\n&quot;part of the game.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t PLAY competitive games with Roxana for quite a few years -  <br/>\njust occasionally trying one out and discovering that, yes, she would  <br/>\nstill get infuriated by it. She handles it fine now - I think she  <br/>\nstill gets some strong feelings, but keeps them to herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - it isn&#39;t about being competitive, it is more about being nice  <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m bothered by your reaction to your son and husband both being  <br/>\ncompetitive. You worry about it? Is your husband making it worse?<br/>\n<br/>\nReally - enjoying competition isn&#39;t a negative personality trait at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, competition usually involves a whole lot of cooperation and  <br/>\ncollaboration, too. Businesses that compete effectively do so because  <br/>\nthere is excellent collaboration and cooperation within the company.  <br/>\nTeamwork!<br/>\n<br/>\nStereotypically and maybe genetically or maybe just culturally, women  <br/>\ntend to be less competitive and men more so. Be careful you aren&#39;t  <br/>\nfalling into a trap of not liking to see some typical masculine traits  <br/>\nappearing in your little boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - this is an unschooling list -- SUPPORT his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind ways for him to be competitive, to revel in his competitive  <br/>\nnature, to do interesting and exciting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a Destination Imagination team for about 5 years - this was an  <br/>\nabsolutely awesome way to both compete AND collaborate. Over the  <br/>\nyears, the kids learned something SO valuable - they learned that the  <br/>\nmore they paid attention to their own team having a great time, the  <br/>\nmore they collaborated happily and harmoniously, the more they  <br/>\nsupported each other, the more they valued each others&#39; strengths --  <br/>\nthe better they actually did in the competition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love noncompetitive games - I have led cooperative games workshops  <br/>\nat homeschooling and unschooling conferences and they are a blast.  <br/>\nBut, to be honest, there is STILL an element of competition in all  <br/>\ngames - in cooperative games, the group is working together to achieve  <br/>\nsome goal - the competition isn&#39;t against each other, but against the  <br/>\nobstacles to achieving their common goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I think these are fun games, for their own sake, but not because  <br/>\nI think there is something wrong with competition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, you can help your son develop ethical competitive  <br/>\nstandards. For example, you can help him realize that winning by  <br/>\ncheating isn&#39;t at all satisfying. And you&#39;ll want to help him develop  <br/>\ngood sportsmanship - appreciation of the other competitors&#39; abilities,  <br/>\nkindness to those who aren&#39;t as strong a competitor as he is, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help him develop a healthy happy competitive nature if you  <br/>\nstep back and accept that he has a interest in competition and you,  <br/>\nunschooling parent that you are, stand ready support and expand on  <br/>\nthat interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he needs MORE competitive outlet, maybe you&#39;re stifling it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171305668,"authorName":"Beth Fleming","from":"Beth Fleming &lt;momofwc@...&gt;","profile":"momofwc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Competition (was Angry Son, Frustrated Mommy)","postDate":"1212690235","msgId":35256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1MzU1OS40NzQ4My5xbUB3ZWIzMDAwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35251,"nextInTopic":35258,"prevInTime":35255,"nextInTime":35257,"topicId":35250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  I wonder if your husband could back off a bit with the competition.....I think (from what I ve seen with the neighbor family....5 kids, all very competitive","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1868701156\"> <br/>\nI wonder if your husband could back off a bit with the competition.....I think (from what I&#39;ve seen with the neighbor family....5 kids, all very competitive including Dad but not Mom) that the Dad in the family really has the idea that he plays his hardest with the kids so that they&#39;ll &quot;learn&quot; how to be tough, stick it out when they&#39;re losing, etc.  I guess I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s had the opposite effect on the kids....very low frustration tolerance level for losing anything of any kind.  My kids are naturally not as competitive and really like to play games for the fun value, but usually before we get together with this particular family, we talk about what might be fun and what might turn out to be not so fun, and we just don&#39;t get into the competition with them.  My sense is as kids get older (as Marji noted in her post), they&#39;re just more able to handle all the feelings that go along with losing and winning: feeling inadequate and frustrated,<br/>\n feeling superior, maybe &quot;getting back&quot; at someone for having lost to them earlier, etc.  It begins not to matter as much, if it takes its natural course.  But I think that always bringing the competitive aspect to their attention at this young age might just be adding fuel to the fire....<br/>\nNot sure if any of this helps or is applicable to your family, just my .02 on competition!<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nBeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Kim Musolff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmoose75@...\">kmoose75@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 5, 2008 11:23:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Competition (was Angry Son, Frustrated Mommy)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Not sure if this is the case with your son, but we have a little neighbor<br/>\nfriend (boy, age 5) who is VERY competitive.

Except in arm wrestling, but he&#39;ll be besting me soon in that, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gaiawolf.org/\">http://gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;Joyfully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gaiawolf.org/\">http://gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf ~ Music for the Planet<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/marjizintz\">http://myspace.com/marjizintz</a>&gt;Marji&#39;s Myspace<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333194003,"authorName":"Kim Musolff","from":"&quot;Kim Musolff&quot; &lt;kmoose75@...&gt;","profile":"kimmusolff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Competition (was Angry Son, Frustrated Mommy)","postDate":"1212679390","msgId":35250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA2MDUwODIzdDE2MTNiZTkwdTJkNDAzM2VhOWNjYWYwNUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35251,"prevInTime":35249,"nextInTime":35251,"topicId":35250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Not sure if this is the case with your son, but we have a little neighbor friend (boy, age 5) who is VERY competitive.

Any sort of game where there<br/>\nis a winner (or he perceives that there is a winner) really sets him off,<br/>\nespecially since he&#39;s one of the younger kids and doesn&#39;t very often win.<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned to facilitate more cooperative/non-competitive games when he&#39;s<br/>\naround.  Sounds like in the &quot;race&quot; with the others kids, the wanting to win<br/>\ngot the best of him.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!  YES!  YES!  He is VERY competitive!  So is my husband.  I worry about<br/>\nthis.  Is it something that children are born with, or something my husband<br/>\nis making worse?  I hate when we all go for family hikes, and it turns in to<br/>\na race.  I always try to point out the beauty around us and the reasons I<br/>\nlike hiking, to balance out the competitive spin he seems to put on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS is playing T-ball now.  They don&#39;t keep score in T-ball.  DS keeps his<br/>\nown score as he plays the games.  &quot;Otherwise, it&#39;s not fun,&quot; he tells me!<br/>\n<br/>\nDD on the otherhand is the complete opposite.  DS could make up a game where<br/>\nthey keep points. She could care less how many points she has.  She always<br/>\nencourages DS, telling him, &quot;You win!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to justify making him NOT competitive, because I do feel<br/>\nlike it&#39;s part of who he is.  I&#39;ve tried to make games more cooperative, and<br/>\nhe really doesn&#39;t seem to get the point.  He gets motivated by points or<br/>\nscores or winning a race.  It feels mean to try and take that away from<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on this?<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35262,"nextTopicId":35279}}
