Years.<br/>\n<br/>\nReminding you that we&#39;re not offering a &quot;technique&quot; that &quot;works&quot; to <br/>\nmagically get your kid to do what you want them to do. I googled around <br/>\nlooking for parenting advice - haven&#39;t done that in quite a long time. <br/>\nThis is typical of what parenting &quot;experts&quot; are promising:<br/>\n<br/>\n*&quot;*Tips That Will Help You Gain Control Over Your Kids. Get Them to Do <br/>\nWhat You Want Them To Do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not promising that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 24 year old who has lived on her own for a few years. She was <br/>\nmessy at home - when she was younger it was a HUGE issue here in our <br/>\nhouse. I didn&#39;t handle it well at all. I felt resentful that I &quot;had to&quot; <br/>\nclean up after her. I made up all kinds of different reward systems that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work out. I yelled and begged and cried. WHAT  a waste!! Later, <br/>\nwhen she was older, I read what others were writing about chores and I <br/>\nchanged. I did a little more work around the house and did it with a <br/>\nhappy-to-be-able-to-do-it attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids didn&#39;t suddenly change and start doing housework.  But, the <br/>\nshaming and fighting stopped. Instantly. I had THAT in my control all <br/>\nthe time. After a few years (remember, my kids were already teens when I <br/>\nstarted this), one day I realized that they were really helpful. I <br/>\nnoticed that they jump up to carry in groceries when I come home from <br/>\nthe store. I&#39;d notice the dishwasher was unloaded. I&#39;d notice someone <br/>\nhad picked up the living room clutter - straightened up. When we have <br/>\ncompany coming over, I&#39;d start cleaning up and the kids would just seem <br/>\nto naturally jump in to help. Rosie sort of took on cleaning the <br/>\nbathroom as her regular thing and just does it once in a while. Rox <br/>\nnotices when the living room needs dusting and just does it. We&#39;re at <br/>\nthe point that I can say, &quot;If anybody has  time, can you do a load of <br/>\ndishes?&quot; and probably someone will.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 24 year old in her own house? She lives pretty much the same way we <br/>\ndo - her house gets messy when she&#39;s busy. When she has more at-home <br/>\ntime her house is nice and neat. She&#39;s fixed it up beautifully - painted <br/>\nin lovely colors and lots of artwork. Slowly, she&#39;s collected some nice <br/>\nfurniture pieces - other people&#39;s give-aways, etc. Her little house is <br/>\nwonderful - very comfy and peaceful and inviting. People like to go hang <br/>\nout there, with her. Isn&#39;t that what really matters?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are at least these three reasons people have &quot;chore battles&quot; with <br/>\ntheir kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. They want the kids to help clean up because they want the cleaning <br/>\ndone and don&#39;t want to do it all themselves. They feel resentful at <br/>\ncleaning up after other people or when other people are having fun.<br/>\n2. They want the kids to help clean up because they think the kids &quot;need <br/>\nto learn how&quot; to do chores so that they can do them when they grow up.<br/>\n3. They want the kids to help clean because they want to be in charge, <br/>\nthey want their kids to be obedient, this is something they can order <br/>\nthem to do and they want their kids to obey orders.<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 -- battles over chores are far worse than doing it yourself in a <br/>\nhappy, peaceful way. Better to create a sweet and calm atmosphere in <br/>\nyour house - if you can do that by doing a little more &quot;picking up&quot; for <br/>\nother people, why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 - kids shamed and badgered and coerced with bribes and punishments <br/>\nwill grow up resenting housework, too. Vicious cycle is being <br/>\nperpetuated. They don&#39;t need to do chores for years and years to learn <br/>\nhow to do them. It isn&#39;t rocket science. They can learn when they need <br/>\nto learn. They can learn a lot more from voluntarily and happily joining <br/>\nin a time or two than from years of force which creates resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n#3 - what do you really want? Is following orders at the top of your <br/>\npriorities? Is it that important to you to feel in control that you&#39;re <br/>\nwilling to have almost daily struggles with your kids over it? Is that <br/>\nthe kind of relationship you want to build with your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"Verna","from":"&quot;Verna&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Chores and Littering","postDate":"1241877048","msgId":44801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1NDFubys2YTNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2N0E0RkNBLTY3NzctNEFBMy1BMDBFLUE0RUFFOUJGNjYxOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":44800,"nextInTopic":44803,"prevInTime":44800,"nextInTime":44802,"topicId":44778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry, I cant find where I think you mentioned that your son is stealing and also he was recently adopted, learning a new language, dealing with attachment","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1253747941\">Sorry, I cant find where I think you mentioned that your son is stealing and also he was recently adopted, learning a new language, dealing with attachment issues. etc... <br/>\nIs your son perhaps dealing with some oppositional behavior due to the attachment issues?

But each child is different.<br/>\nThis child steals from the other kids&#39; rooms.  This is very<br/>\nunderstandable.  Nine months ago, he didn&#39;t have a thing to call <br/>\nhis own.  He is learning so much about ownership and boundaries <br/>\nand abundance.  He is still living with fear that all this new wonderful <br/>\nstuff:  the toys, the food, the screens, the freedoms, the hugging<br/>\narms, will go away.  He will let go of those fears when he is ready.<br/>\nMeanwhile, he may hoard things, he may steal things, he may<br/>\nexpress general distrust in many ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, last time he stole gum from a brother&#39;s room,<br/>\nhis brother asked him to use some of his allowance to pay him<br/>\nback for the gum, and DS did that.  We reiterated that we don&#39;t go<br/>\ninto other people&#39;s rooms or take other people&#39;s things without asking,<br/>\nand then I mentioned that if he wants gum, it is nicer to buy<br/>\nhis own than to take it from his brother&#39;s desk drawer.  I offered<br/>\nto bring him to the store to buy his own gum when he wants gum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, usually, I would agree with this approach:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If they wanted gum, I would say &quot;I&#39;m afraid if I give this  <br/>\n&gt; to you I&#39;ll end up having to pick it up, and that&#39;s yucky.&quot; (or the  <br/>\n&gt; equivalent in your own common phrasing--not that very phrase, but  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d&#39;ve said that,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But in this case, I feel in building the relationship, that it<br/>\nis more important to prioritize finding a way for him to get<br/>\ngum that doesn&#39;t involve stealing it than it is to set up the<br/>\nif/then contract about gum-chewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would (and I have, often) give them a kleenex or paper napkin, too,  <br/>\n&gt; and say &quot;keep this to put the gum in when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have shown him how to keep the wrapper, and how to put the <br/>\ngum in the wrapper when he is done with it, but he&#39;s not choosing<br/>\nto do that.  Or, he&#39;s just forgetting.  It&#39;s easier just to spit the gum<br/>\nout, and he&#39;s coming from a culture where spitting (saliva) in public<br/>\n(even indoors) is not considered impolite.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  It doesn&#39;t need to be a lecture about  littering, but they did <br/>\n&gt; know that there were fines for littering. I&#39;d  read signs to them <br/>\n&gt; as a matter of course, about the rules of parks or  whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, it feels that way to me, too, that he should be aware of the<br/>\nrules.  He can understand that there are different rules in a park<br/>\nthan there are at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here, again, is the mental roadblock I&#39;m setting up for myself<br/>\nvis-a-vis chores:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have  to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay.  But then, why not:  &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you left your dirty<br/>\ndishes in front of the Playstation and I have to pick them up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on.  There is a slippery slope and a tendency to fall<br/>\nback into have tos.  If he doesn&#39;t have to carry his own dirty<br/>\ndishes to the sink or his own dirty laundry to the hamper,<br/>\nwhy should he have to carry his garbage to the garbage can?<br/>\nBecause there are seven people sharing these rooms and six<br/>\nof us don&#39;t like that level of mess? <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I tell him that it&#39;s not fair for him to make certain messes,<br/>\nbut that he&#39;s completely encouraged to make others? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, we could go to the other extreme; we&#39;ve got one son <br/>\nwho thrives on peace and quiet and order.  That is not our house,<br/>\nnot usually.  There are ongoing board games left out.  (Civilization <br/>\n--old school, board game version--takes a long time to play!  <br/>\nChess, too, if each person is only making a move<br/>\nonce or twice a day.)  There are science projects in various stages.<br/>\nThere is artwork being made, or drying, or whatever.  There<br/>\nis music being played, usually homemade, on various instruments<br/>\nwe enjoy playing, but occasionally coming out of the iPod.  There<br/>\nare books and video game cartridges lying about.  There are puzzles<br/>\nin various stages of creation.  My extremely neat son sees all of<br/>\nthis as &quot;mess.&quot;  The rest of us see &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;creativity.&quot;  I tidy things<br/>\nup to the extent that I can, without interfering with other&#39;s creations,<br/>\nwhen I get around to it, but usually I choose to be in the middle of<br/>\nall the fun and creativity.  I focus on having clean dishes to eat<br/>\noff of and clean clothes to wear.  Still, gum stuck to the floor, or<br/>\nin the carpet?

I announced that there were garbage cans all over and<br/>\nshowed them both where they all were.  I didn&#39;t have a problem with that<br/>\nmuch after that.
