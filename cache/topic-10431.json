When he&#39;s fly fishing, there can be no<br/>\ntime limit, it&#39;s a thing that needs exactly the amount of time and<br/>\nattention as he will give it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am painting or writing poetry I can go for hours and hours, not<br/>\neating, just doing, until the session comes to a natural end.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI would no more take away my husbands shop or fly rod than he would take<br/>\naway my paints or paper.<br/>\nThat seems like a totally unhealthy and inappropriate response to a<br/>\nnatural human need. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t make my husband earn his time fly fishing and I don&#39;t take his<br/>\ntime away if he&#39;s grumpy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to point out what is obvious to unschoolers, that kids learn at<br/>\ntheir own pace and in their own time.  They learn to talk this way and<br/>\nwalk and read and count money.    I think we need to remember that kids<br/>\nwill learn about their own schedules and limits and game system abilities<br/>\nthe same way.  It doesn&#39;t come all at once or because we say so,  it<br/>\ncomes by them being able to do it until they understand.

I can&#39;t imaging any parent who would give a<br/>\ntoddler only a half hour a day to try to learn to walk.   <br/>\nApply this to anything else, learning to talk, learning to get dressed or<br/>\nride a bike or catch a ball...

He was very<br/>\nresponsible but that&#39;s his nature.  He started with games like Spyro and<br/>\nCroc and really in the beginning played for long hours, learning every<br/>\ntiny detail and mastering the controller.   It was an amazing thing to<br/>\nwatch.    And like all things children find their own balance once the<br/>\nneed to figure out everything has been fulfilled.  My son&#39;s Playstation<br/>\nuse is like anything else.   When there&#39;s a new game he plays until he&#39;s<br/>\ngot an active picture of it in his mind and until he&#39;s had some success. <br/>\n  It&#39;s the same way I read or do a puzzle,  working at it for hours one<br/>\nor two days and then in bits or pieces others.     <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, please, resist the idea to freak out when the game is new and<br/>\nthey want to play a lot.&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t agree with the other poster that<br/>\nthis is addictive or that a deep interest is obsessive.    I think a deep<br/>\ninterest is the sign of an intelligent child, who will find a way to<br/>\naccomplish the goals of the game.  I think this is really healthy and<br/>\nnecessary and I hope you can think about their experiences with a game<br/>\nsystem the way you would an artists need to paint or a poets need to<br/>\nwrite.   It&#39;s a real need and it&#39;s normal, and there will be times of<br/>\nhigher interest and times of less interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring times of high interest, like the first month or two, you might<br/>\nhave to take food to your kids.  &lt;g&gt;   Really, the games are so fun that<br/>\nit&#39;s hard to leave them at first to go do less important things, like<br/>\neat.  This is another point where parents go nuts and decide their kids<br/>\nare addicted, because they don&#39;t want to come to the dinner table. <br/>\nRemain calm!&lt;g&gt;   Take them food,   keep them happy.  This too shall<br/>\npass. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan would get wildly frustrated at some of his games when he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nachieve some goal.  It is my experience that it&#39;s best to sympathize at<br/>\nsuch times and let them work through it in their own way.  We listened to<br/>\na lot of growling and some stomping but I think it&#39;s really important for<br/>\nthem to be able to progress in a natural way.    This is the other place<br/>\nwhere some parents go berserk and take the game away,&lt;g&gt; and I would<br/>\nreally, really NOT do that.    Think how you would respond if they were<br/>\nfrustrated with trying to read a book.   You wouldn&#39;t demand they leave<br/>\nit alone, or take it away, you&#39;d offer sympathy and  you&#39;d  let them work<br/>\nit out.    It&#39;s just a little noisier with a game system.&lt;g&gt;  As time<br/>\ngoes on it gets easier for them to stay calm because they have a lot of<br/>\nexperience that tells them they&#39;ll get it eventually. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t live without some kind of game system or other, they are that<br/>\nwonderful.

I had it engraved with &quot;Homer&quot; just like Homer did when<br/>\nhe gave Marge a bowling ball. I really was giving it to Jocelyn (and me), I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t thinking of Matthew at the time. The Gameboy was hers not Matthews,<br/>\nand later when he was I&#39;m guessing about 2 and took an interest in it, he<br/>\nseemed to take better care of it than a lot of his stuff because he knew it<br/>\nbelonged to his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Secondly, if we do choose to get him a system some<br/>\n&gt; time in the near future (I mean it breaks my heart to<br/>\n&gt; watch him &quot;plug&quot; the antennae of his little remote<br/>\n&gt; control car into his toy plane, and select a matchbox<br/>\n&gt; car from a pile to insert into the plane as a game<br/>\n&gt; cartridge, and pretend to play a game &quot;MOMMY!

Do you ever ask him how these games are played and what<br/>\nstrategy he uses? <br/>\nThere are hundreds of sites out there that discuss the pros and cons of the<br/>\nvarious systems. If it were me, Like Sandra said, I would go with a Nintendo<br/>\n64. There are lots of games written for it that appeal to kids your son&#39;s<br/>\nage. Buying it and the games used is far less expensive than the current<br/>\nmodels and they are in plentiful supply. So for the same money as a new<br/>\nsystem and one game - you can get a very good system and many, many games<br/>\nand I would bet that the older kids in your support group have games,<br/>\nexperience, and advice to share with you and your son on that gamming<br/>\nplatform.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some help and or advice here would be great, as I have<br/>\n&gt; zero experience with these systems and the two video<br/>\n&gt; or arcade style games I like are tetris and pinball.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tetris was the game that was included with the original Gameboy and what got<br/>\nboth Jocelyn and me so interested in it.

I was reluctant at first but we&#39;ve had some surprising<br/>\noutcomes.  One, the two cooperate much more on things.  They want to do<br/>\nbetter on the games and this means they must share information.  Our 8<br/>\nyear old is a much better reader than the 6 year old.  The older boy<br/>\nreads the strategy guide to the younger one.  THey also learned a lot<br/>\nabout map reading from these guides as they take the player through each<br/>\nroom in the game and provide an overall map of the level.  These guides<br/>\nhave been a godsend for reading in our house.  Reading is a big goal of<br/>\nours and anything that supports that is ok by me....well almost<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHile I hate the addictive quality, I am pleased with my younger sons<br/>\nincreased interest and hard work to read and sound out words.  It is<br/>\nalso a great motivator for work and chores.  When they obsess too much<br/>\non the game, we take it away for a few days.  We also allow them to earn<br/>\nmore time by doing extra projects.  They start with half our each and<br/>\nearn more time with more work.  If they get to where they are yelling<br/>\nand fighting over it, they get about 2 minutes to find a solution or the<br/>\nwhole thing goes off.  It is amazing how fast problems can be solved<br/>\nwhen &quot;beloved&quot; is headed for the closet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also nice to have something to keep them occupied when I&#39;m not<br/>\nfeeling well.

One is that we are not certain<br/>\na child this young can handle the responsibility of<br/>\nhis own system and his own games, when he still leaves<br/>\ntoys out in the rain and his room looks like a tornado<br/>\nhit it.  What ages have others introduced game systems<br/>\ninto the house and how did that go?  I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nhave to police his game system because he abuses it,<br/>\nparticularly as his one year younger brother would<br/>\nprobably own half the system as well, or is it a bad<br/>\nidea for them to share a system? <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, if we do choose to get him a system some<br/>\ntime in the near future (I mean it breaks my heart to<br/>\nwatch him &quot;plug&quot; the antennae of his little remote<br/>\ncontrol car into his toy plane, and select a matchbox<br/>\ncar from a pile to insert into the plane as a game<br/>\ncartridge, and pretend to play a game &quot;MOMMY!  I got<br/>\nLevel 48 and 7 points!&quot;) What systems are best?  Which<br/>\nones have the best games, are easy to operate and will<br/>\ngrow with our boys?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome help and or advice here would be great, as I have<br/>\nzero experience with these systems and the two video<br/>\nor arcade style games I like are tetris and pinball.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10484,"nextTopicId":10493}}
