We live in coastal SC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve joined the group for some support and inspiration.  I belong to <br/>\nan active homeschooling community, but most of the members are &quot;school <br/>\nat home&quot; families.  I respect and am grateful for my local group but <br/>\nsometimes have questions, musings and quandaries very specific to our <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle.
