We stapled them, but a back and front cover on it and it<br/>\nlooked wonderful.  He loved it so much that he made 2 more.  He&#39;s decided<br/>\nhe&#39;s going to sell books.  He even put $4 on the back of his book.  Do I<br/>\nhave a little entrepenaur like me in my house?  This has led to us talking<br/>\nabout the very first printed book in China and talking about when you can<br/>\nread more then you can go and investigate further.  He seemed to like this<br/>\nidea.  The benefit of seeing what&#39;s going on with him now is that some of my<br/>\nfears are going away about unschooling.  I guess it takes a while to really,<br/>\nreally settle into this and be ok with what we are doing.  I also noticed<br/>\nhow much easier it is when I don&#39;t try to control the situation.  If we are<br/>\ngoing swimming and they get sidetracked on the way because they are in the<br/>\nmiddle of something still, then I just wait.  I used to spend an awful lot<br/>\nof my energy getting them to places at the last minute when they are not<br/>\nthose type of kids.  So instead of them changing I&#39;ve finally decided it&#39;s<br/>\nme that has to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks ladies for letting me learn for you who have been doing this for so<br/>\nlong.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn Falbe<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9678,"nextTopicId":9650}}
