I decided I didn&#39;t want to be a  part of what we<br/>\ncalled &quot;the system.&quot;<br/>\nThis time, I&#39;m not a student but an  instructor. And I&#39;m dropping out<br/>\nagain. It will be hard, very hard, because  I love teaching.<br/>\nBut I know when I&#39;m beat. I can&#39;t do this job  anymore.<br/>\nHere&#39;s the problem: In our zeal for numbers, for measuring our kids  so<br/>\nwe can report that they really can write because they&#39;ve passed a test,<br/>\nwe&#39;re focusing on the forest but forgetting the trees.<br/>\nWriting is putting  ideas on paper. That&#39;s all -- and it&#39;s a lot. It&#39;s<br/>\none of the most important  things we can learn to do, putting our ideas<br/>\non paper, expressing what we  think. Putting our ideas on paper can make<br/>\nmagic.<br/>\nBut to make kids pass  our standardized tests, we force them to see<br/>\nwriting as simply a formula, as  anything but what it really is. Writing<br/>\nshould be dangerous stuff -- and it  was before we killed it.<br/>\nWe tell kids, &quot;Okay, this is how to write. You must  have five paragraphs<br/>\nin your essay, and the first paragraph must have a  thesis sentence in<br/>\nwhich you specify the three main points of your paper,  and each<br/>\nparagraph must have four to seven sentences, and each sentence must  have<br/>\neight to 10 words.&quot; (Yes, trust me; that&#39;s what they&#39;re being  taught.)<br/>\nBut we forget that we&#39;re not talking about words and sentences and<br/>\nparagraphs; we&#39;re talking about ideas. What we&#39;re really telling<br/>\nstudents is that they must have exactly three ideas in everything they<br/>\nwrite, and each idea must be exactly such a length. And it&#39;s ludicrous.<br/>\nIdeas can&#39;t be measured; they can&#39;t be quantified.<br/>\nBut I&#39;m clearly in the  minority now, marching in the opposite direction,<br/>\ngoing against all the  educators and bureaucrats. Still, I refuse to<br/>\nteach -- even to allow -- this  mediocre writing, this uninspired thinking.<br/>\nSo, I quit. Our children, our  teenagers, are victims of the Stockholm<br/>\nSyndrome; they&#39;ve begun identifying  with their captors. Our schools have<br/>\nbrainwashed them into believing that  writing -- that thinking -- is<br/>\nsimply a matter of numbers. I can no longer  teach them because, more<br/>\nthan ever, they no longer believe me when I tell  them that writing in<br/>\nthe real world isn&#39;t like that.<br/>\nLook, I tell them.  Read something that&#39;s been published. Do you find<br/>\neverything in five neat  paragraphs, with four to seven sentences in each<br/>\nparagraph?<br/>\nThey look at  me. Why am I telling them this?<br/>\nAnd look, I say. Don&#39;t real writers repeat  words? (Oh, yes -- they&#39;re<br/>\ntold they must never repeat words.) And their  eyes give away their<br/>\nmistrust of what I&#39;m telling them. I&#39;m denying the  validity of their<br/>\nbelief system, contradicting everything they&#39;ve been  told.<br/>\nBut I keep trying. Look, I say. Don&#39;t all these writers, these people<br/>\nwho have been published, don&#39;t they often use the word &quot;I&quot;? (They&#39;re<br/>\ntold they must never use that word in most schools.) Don&#39;t some of these<br/>\nreal writers use paragraphs that are one sentence long, or sentences<br/>\nthat are one word long? These people you&#39;re reading are real writers,<br/>\nand they know there are no formulas to follow in writing.<br/>\nAs I say it,  though, I know I&#39;m telling them a lie. There are formulas<br/>\nin writing, the  ones the people in Tallahassee use to show us that our<br/>\nchildren can write.  That the system works.<br/>\nYes, it works: It produces unthinking teenagers who  produce automatic<br/>\nessays full of, well . . . nothing, really. Because  another thing<br/>\nthey&#39;re taught is that opinions are bad. Of course, opinions  express<br/>\nideas, and if you follow that thinking through to its logical<br/>\nconclusion, then ideas are bad. I&#39;ll have my students read a<br/>\nparticularly good essay, and they&#39;ll say, Well, but that&#39;s an opinion.<br/>\nYes, it is, I answer. And? And, well, that&#39;s bad. You can&#39;t have<br/>\nopinions, only facts.<br/>\nSo they go out into the world, and they&#39;re timid;  they&#39;re afraid to have<br/>\nan opinion. Ah, but that&#39;s good: good for business,  which likes people<br/>\nto do as they&#39;re told; good for the country, because  dissent, especially<br/>\nnow, is . . . well, not good.<br/>\nSo I tell them, You  know, it was a crime in most of this country many<br/>\nyears ago to teach a slave  to read or write. Why do you think we had<br/>\nthose laws? Sometimes, one of the  less timid students will cautiously<br/>\nraise a hand and take a stab at it.  Because slaves could get ideas?<br/>\nRight, yes. Slaves could get ideas, and ideas  are dangerous. The owners,<br/>\nthose in power, didn&#39;t want that. Do you see any  parallel between that<br/>\nand what&#39;s happening in our schools?<br/>\nNo, they  don&#39;t. Oh, I might have one occasionally who gets it, but the<br/>\nmajority have  been trained so well they don&#39;t see any connection.<br/>\nMost of them think I&#39;m  nuts. Just another crazy, ranting professor.<br/>\nTheir eyes blink off, and they  go someplace where they don&#39;t have to<br/>\nthink about what I&#39;m saying. They&#39;re  planning lunch or their trip to<br/>\nYbor City that night. Someplace safe.<br/>\nBut  I&#39;m trying to steer them away from that safety, that sameness. I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to  make them dangerous. I&#39;m trying to get them to think.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll have none of  that, thank you. Our young people have had the<br/>\nthinking beaten out of them.  We do it in our classrooms, in what we have<br/>\nthem write. We do it especially  in what we have them read. It&#39;s no<br/>\nlonger a secret that our standardized  tests, even our textbooks, have<br/>\nbeen sanitized. They&#39;ve been cut up, had all  the important ideas taken<br/>\nout of them -- all the tough questions, the  conflicts.<br/>\nI explain to my students that writers don&#39;t write about nice  things;<br/>\nthey write about the hard things, the difficult ideas. No one writes<br/>\nabout what a nice day it is.<br/>\nBut all this has been going on for years. So  why am I quitting now?<br/>\nBecause it&#39;s about to get much worse. Now that  Tallahassee has taken<br/>\nover completely, now that we&#39;re to have one seamless  educational system,<br/>\nprekindergarten through graduate school, the practices  entrenched in our<br/>\nschools will become entrenched in our colleges.<br/>\nIt&#39;s  happening already. The students who have been trained to write this<br/>\nway are  now teachers who teach writing this way. More and more, I<br/>\nencounter college  writing instructors who insist on the formula: five<br/>\nparagraphs, no more --  even in advanced courses, even in other<br/>\ndepartments. The older professors,  the ones to whom the formula essay is<br/>\nsimply bad writing, are retiring. The  younger ones are taking over,<br/>\npassing on their wisdom about writing, what  they were taught: Count your<br/>\nideas. Be careful not to have too many.<br/>\nAnd  if a student dares to have four ideas, instead of three? . . . Toss<br/>\none out.  Only three ideas allowed. I&#39;ve seen students fail assignments<br/>\nbecause they  had the wrong numbers.<br/>\nAnd they can&#39;t stop writing that way. Many have told  me, even in tears,<br/>\nthat they try to write differently, but they  can&#39;t.<br/>\nBrainwashing does that. Now, imagine the future. Imagine these  students,<br/>\nyour children, afraid to write, to put their ideas on paper.  Imagine<br/>\nthem trying to fight for what they believe in -- if they&#39;re brave  enough<br/>\nto believe in anything at all.<br/>\nImagine them in business. In  medicine. In law.<br/>\nIn politics.<br/>\nAs for me, I have no children, other than  the ones I&#39;ve worked with over<br/>\nthe years. But I no longer can fight this  system, the one that tries to<br/>\ndeaden our kids, to make them afraid to think.  Worse, I&#39;m afraid that<br/>\neventually they&#39;ll get to me, too.<br/>\nThe first time  I dropped out of college, I was afraid the system would<br/>\nkill my ideas and  make me less human. I didn&#39;t want any part of it.<br/>\nThis time, the system is  different, but the result will be the same.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want any part of this  system, either.<br/>\n-- Lynn Stratton has taught writing at the University of  South Florida<br/>\nfor 13 years.
