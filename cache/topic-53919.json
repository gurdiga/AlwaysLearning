That was the late 1960s. It&#39;s interesting to remember that had I worked out the arithmetic with a pencil and paper as I was taught to do at school I would have been regarded as totally daft.

The way they are expressing this now is by setting me problems to solve. Sometimes they want me to multiply a 2 or 3-digit number by a 1-digit number. I do them in my head. I couldn&#39;t have done this until a few years ago, when I was belatedly introduced to techniques like Kirby&#39;s multiplying-by-18 trick (multiply by 20 and then subtract the extra 2s).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a book called &quot;right brain math&quot; from &quot;Mr. Numbers&quot; that shows a different way to build the times tables; the completed table emphasized the patterns that run through it in a different way than the usual 1-10 by 1-10 grid. My kids have dabbled in it; I find it really neat. Mr. Numbers also does other cool charts for specific numbers. He&#39;s kind of fun.
