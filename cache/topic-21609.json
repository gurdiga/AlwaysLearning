If I have done anything to offend you then  I apologize.  Have I <br/>\noffended you? -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m doing what I&#39;m willing to do and interested in doing,  which is providing <br/>\na discussion for serious unschoolers.  There  is a beginning unschooling list <br/>\n(I&#39;m not on it, which should make it &quot;safe,&quot;  right?) called Unschooling <br/>\nBasics, and there&#39;s another list for unschoolers  with children younger than <br/>\nofficial &quot;school age&quot; and they&#39;re both linked and  easily joined here:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/other_\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/other)\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-I have gotten several messages in my inbox from other  people from the <br/>\ngroup who feel that I am doing good but won&#39;t post  that at the group because <br/>\nthey are afraid of being attacked and  misunderstood. -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nNo one is ever required to post. <br/>\nNo one as far as I know  is probited from starting her own yahoolist to <br/>\ndiscuss unschooling  however she wants.  If anyone wants to start a yahoogroups <br/>\nlist with a  different focus or tone and announce it on this list, that would be  <br/>\nfine.<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-It is my understanding that the group was intended to  support <br/>\nunschoolers not alienate them.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThe group&#39;s description is below.  When people say  &quot;support group&quot; they seem <br/>\noften to mean that others will coo and sympathize and  say &quot;there there&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;good mom.&quot;  There are such lists out there.   They don&#39;t specialize in really <br/>\nhelping people understand any higher ideals,  they specialize in cooing and <br/>\nempty sympathy.   When my neopets pet  says &quot;You are the best owner ever!&quot; it <br/>\nmakes me feel good, but it&#39;s not  real.  All the cyber-pets say that to all the <br/>\ncyber-owners.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-A little kindness goes a long way.-=-  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy focus is unschooling, not individuals who admit they don&#39;t  care about <br/>\nunschooling.  There are six billion and some people in the  world.  I don&#39;t care <br/>\nas much about the economics of rice farming or the  Antarctic ice shelf or <br/>\nwhat happened to the Wankel engine as I care about  unschooling.  That seems <br/>\nentirely normal and reasonable to me.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I&#39;m equally &quot;kind&quot; to everyone regardless of whether their  arguments and <br/>\nposts support unschooling or not, I&#39;m being kind to no one.   The list won&#39;t <br/>\nfunction.  If the list &quot;supports&quot; things that lead  away from or sabotage <br/>\nunschooling, those who really want to move directly toward  better unschooling will <br/>\nwander away.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not an alcoholic, but my mom was and I&#39;ve been to AA  meetings with her.  <br/>\nI was never a La Leche League leader, but I attended  meetings for years.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt AA meetings they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; people who want to keep  drinking for now <br/>\nand maybe stop gradually.<br/>\nLa Leche League leaders are not obligated or expected to spend  one moment of <br/>\ntheir time advising a mom on how to schedule bottle  feedings.<br/>\nI&#39;m volunteering my time and energy, as are the many excellent  regular <br/>\nposters whose words are quoted on computers and refrigerator doors all  over the <br/>\nworld now, and I don&#39;t know about them, but I can&#39;t be expected to go a  long <br/>\nway kindly supporting school at home.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this quote doesn&#39;t come out clearly, it&#39;s  here:<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/_\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nDescription <br/>\nCategory: _Attachment  Parenting_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/dir/Family___Home/Parenting/Attachment_Parenting)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/dir/Family___Home/Parenting/Attachment_Parenting)</a>        Discussion for homeschooling fans of <br/>\nJohn Holt, whose books  Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your <br/>\nOwn have made  unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the  uncooperative. (Not <br/>\nmoderated in the advance-approval way, but in  the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an <br/>\nidea group and is intended to lean  more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>\ngeneral homeschooling  discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>\ndiscussions  for newcomers.
