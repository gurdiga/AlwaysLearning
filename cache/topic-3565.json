He&#39;s now 12.

They&#39;ve exchanged Christmas presents for two years -- he&#39;s also <br/>\ngiven presents to friends who are boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now pressuring him to declare himself her boyfriend, saying that she&#39;d <br/>\nfeel better at school if she could say she had one.  He is not interested in <br/>\nthat status or in exploring that part of himself at this stage, feels <br/>\nuncomfortable about her insistence, and is backing off from the relationship. <br/>\n It&#39;s sad, really, because he has worked to be a good friend, and feels a bit <br/>\nhelpless in the face of this.  He has been surprised by some of the things <br/>\nshe&#39;s done to be accepted at school, and this is another in that vein.
