He has either unschooled or<br/>\nchosen school (a couple of years of high school in an art school) his whole<br/>\nlife. He has what some would call &quot;severe&quot; issues. In fact, without my<br/>\nknowledge, a psychologist at the school termed him &quot;severely disabled&quot; on<br/>\npaper. I only describe him in these ways as a means of showing that he<br/>\nprobably compares to how other autistic-like kids were described here. He<br/>\nwas probably quite similar to how another young child was described in this<br/>\nthread when he was that age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Pure<br/>\n&gt;&gt;unschooling for them just wasn&#39;t working for our auties.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If one is mindfully watching and learning about their child, responding to<br/>\ntheir needs, providing the things that give them joy, pleasantly providing<br/>\ninformation (in whatever way is most helpful to the child), creating the<br/>\nenvironment that gives them the most peace (while sometimes adding more<br/>\nelements of society as they are ready to handle them) and most of all,<br/>\nliving with the attitude that all is well and that their young person is<br/>\nperfect as he is...what is unpure about that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a focus on what our children do well and what they are passionate about<br/>\n(even if it is red buttons that twirl), we can see who they are and where<br/>\nthey shine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids show a need to be hand-held through things that others fly through<br/>\nwith ease. My son wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t walk through doorways, particularly if<br/>\nthere were people on the other side, for many years. This presented barriers<br/>\nin the world that most people don&#39;t have. So we would stand together outside<br/>\nof whatever doorway was the barrier until he and I figured out how he could<br/>\nget through it with the least amount of anxiety. Eventually, doorways were<br/>\nnot so much an issue. Though to this day he will stop outside a new doorway<br/>\nand think and breathe before getting over the anxiety to go in, but he has<br/>\ndeveloped this skill, and can now go into a world of doorways on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we had to get through a doorway more quickly than he was ready<br/>\nfor, btw. I sometimes had to carry him through apologizing for not having<br/>\nthe time to go more slowly. Because most of the time we went through<br/>\ndoorways at his pace, he never seemed to hold it against me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;When I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>went to read what John Holt had to say on the subject, the example<br/>\nthat was given of homeschooling an autistic child was not<br/>\nunschooling, it was more traditional, structured homeschooling.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t read John on the subject of autism, but can say that for my guy, I<br/>\ndid have to slow down for all kinds of things that my other three children<br/>\n&quot;got&quot; quite naturally. I learned from him what helped and what didn&#39;t. His<br/>\nstress level showed me what and when to stop. His joy or lack thereof showed<br/>\nme which directions to go. He was usually open to my guidance in the areas<br/>\nthat he needed to function in life (using the bathroom properly, public<br/>\nplace behavior, etc.) because of the respect and admiration we gave him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said earlier that math is easy actually. I don&#39;t think my guy has a<br/>\nmath chip, or at least his math chip is not like anyone else&#39;s I&#39;ve<br/>\nencountered. It is interesting to watch as he tries to put this kind of<br/>\nthinking together. He has some functional math-type skills...can add objects<br/>\nand in his head pretty easily now. He couldn&#39;t measure in a measuring cup<br/>\nuntil recently, and frankly, opposes the whole idea that anything SHOULD be<br/>\nexact (and this kind of thinking has opened worlds to me, thank you ds).<br/>\nNumbers on paper are aliens at this point. He can read, though mostly skims<br/>\nas far as I can tell. He can&#39;t count money or change, though we&#39;ve done<br/>\ngazillions of real life activities around it, in fun. I did try some<br/>\nstructured teaching around this and that was not worth the damage to our<br/>\nrelationship. Right now he functions on trust at the stores, pays for things<br/>\nand doesn&#39;t even try to count the change. So this got us to thinking...how<br/>\nmany situations do people actually get the wrong change back in a<br/>\nsignificant way (I mean by tens)? I know it happens occasionally, but not<br/>\nenough for me to try to drill something in my son&#39;s head that it&#39;s not ready<br/>\nfor or not accepting, for whatever reason. He knows he has these pretty big<br/>\ngaps, and tries to work on them himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, his sense of direction. He can get lost in our little<br/>\nneighborhood. He wants independence. He has been taking driving lessons for<br/>\nover a year, and it&#39;s not clear whether he&#39;ll be able to get his license<br/>\nanytime soon. So he walks and recently starting hopping on the bus. We<br/>\ncontinue to work on this one. He&#39;s gotten very lost in far away places on<br/>\nthe bus system (thank god for cell phones!!). I&#39;ve picked him up twice from<br/>\npolice calls when someone was concerned about a wandering man who &quot;looked<br/>\nout of it&quot; called the police...that&#39;s how he looks often in public...out of<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen police have questioned him, they quickly understand that he is a good<br/>\nguy lost. That&#39;s what he was!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to continue to help him live in this world, we&#39;ve made maps and had<br/>\nwritten instructions for what to do when lost, he carries ID with emergency<br/>\nphone numbers, he has three family phone numbers memorized...all this just<br/>\nto be able to go somewhere outside of home without a parent. At almost 20<br/>\nyears old. Even the trips where he ended up lost and/or with police<br/>\ninvolvement were just part of his journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Now, I have found that a traditional curriculum does not work very<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no curriculum out there that will follow our individual children&#39;s<br/>\nneeds and passions.

I don&#39;t know anything you can do on how to help her <br/>\nbecome better, but would like to share a common scenario in Asia, <br/>\nwhere I&#39;m from.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Her personality is quite recognizable in Asia. In Asia, everyone <br/>\nwill know of someone who&#39;s known as &quot;something missing from the <br/>\nhead&quot; character. You may think this is rude, but bear in mind the <br/>\nword &quot;retard&quot; is also the upmost degrading word anyone will call <br/>\nanyone in Asia. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. These personalities is accepted in our community, tho not in the <br/>\nhighest regards, but nevertheless accepted for what they are. <br/>\nHarmless and gullible. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. They grew up to be very much part of the community. They can be <br/>\nseen working in many jobs but mostly repitative jobs like serving in <br/>\na restaurant, or mechanical workshops. In my community 1 can think <br/>\nof 2- a male and my friend Rose and another child that I&#39;m <br/>\nacquianted with for a short while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe male is known to be very good at fixing any small electrical <br/>\nstuffs, especially a table fan. Everybody likes him because he&#39;s <br/>\nproved himself to be useful to the community. He can be seen walking <br/>\neverywhere with bags on his back,and quite often a fan hanging onto <br/>\nhis back. He must now be around his 30s. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 18 yr old friend Rose is working for the family food business. <br/>\nShe can be seen serving and cleaning along with her older sister at <br/>\nthier food stall. The family is very typical asian, very re-active <br/>\nand combustive sort of dynamics, so lots of snapping and shouting <br/>\ntowards each other. So Rose can have a temper when she thinks she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen wronged LOL! She is very chatting, and curious, asked alot fo <br/>\nquestions and do enjoy the male attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nRose eventually married a guy who&#39;s very similar to her condition. <br/>\nShe&#39;s moved on, and opened her own food stall with the new hubby, <br/>\nselling the same dishes that she&#39;s learned to do all her life. As <br/>\nfar as I can tell, they are both still very gullible and happy and <br/>\nindependant. She still greets me like she&#39;s just seen me yesterday, <br/>\ndespite the fact I&#39;ve been away for the past 5 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nJuliana, 15 yrs old, comes from a very rich family. She doesn&#39;t go <br/>\nto school and was out of school since she was 9. I supposed the <br/>\nfamily is unschooling of some sort. Juliane went to any lessons <br/>\nJuliana wants, and when she wants. From piano to martial arts to <br/>\narts and crafts. As she&#39;s now in her teens, she&#39;s beginning to take <br/>\nnotice of boys, and she thinks eveyrone that speaks to her is in <br/>\nlove with her LOL! Now, Juliana decides she needs make-up, pretty <br/>\ndresses and manicure and pedicure. And so this is what her parents <br/>\nis providing her. They are very concern of the type of boyfriend <br/>\nshe&#39;s gonna end up with, so I must say, the matchmaking is in the <br/>\nprocess already. But I can see it can be a tricky situation because <br/>\nJuliana, as gullible and naive as she is, is very strong and <br/>\nconfident of her likes and dislikes. She has her favourite boybands, <br/>\nand she hates certain actresses because they looked ugly. <br/>\n  <br/>\n4. Most of them are happy. Maybe becuase they are oblivious to alot <br/>\nof our society&#39;s cruel talks and views about them. They are so <br/>\ngullible that they can be so easily be pacified when annoyed. The <br/>\nones that are aggresive are the ones who gets smacked and hit and <br/>\nshouted at all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Families in Asia do not place alot of expectations of any sort on <br/>\nthese children. They just accept their limitations, and go along <br/>\nwith it. The family just focused on teaching life skills the best <br/>\nthey can and protect them from all the baddies around. One of the <br/>\nupmost fear is that if these kids should fall into the hands of bad <br/>\ncompany, which is why a family responsibilities towards such <br/>\nchildren never ends even when they are married and become parents <br/>\nthemselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe family all do hope eventually, they will be able to find the <br/>\nright marriage partner for thier child, to what I can tell, the <br/>\ngirls are certainly more aware of boyfriends and marriage, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know about the boys.    <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of them thinks of professional help maybe because <br/>\n1) there is no such thing existing until quite recently; and <br/>\n2) they understood that this is the character of thier children, <br/>\nthey just accept it. It&#39;s not an illness that can be fixed. Afterall <br/>\nthe illness has already occured when in the tummy, which caused the <br/>\nchild to be like this. They just move forwards trying to make the <br/>\nbest of everything. So we do have cases whereby families abndoned <br/>\nthese children in private care homes or orphanage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for severe autism cases, I&#39;m not too sure what to think of it. I <br/>\nhave spoken to someone who&#39;s homeschooling an autistic child. They <br/>\nare using professionals to teach their kid to verbalise things. The <br/>\nmethod she mentioned to me sounds so cruel, but then I&#39;m not in that <br/>\nposition, so I cannot agree or disagree. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the question i asked myself too. If my child is just <br/>\nsitting there, not moving, not talking, not responding, just <br/>\nabsorded into his own world, what would I do? Would I imposed series <br/>\nof activities, forcing him out of that world? Or would I just spend <br/>\nmore time with him, constantly connecting and talking with him, <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s ready to come out of his shell? <br/>\n<br/>\nI really dont&#39; know but I do know, when my aspie kid was slightly <br/>\nover a year old, we thought he was deaf and had him checked out. He <br/>\nwasn&#39;t.  Thinking back now, we knew it&#39;s possibly an autistic sign <br/>\nthat we missed. He was a loner. But it never bothered us knowing he <br/>\nwas slightly different, so we just carried on interacting with him <br/>\nall the time. We also realised that from his asperger&#39;s diagnostics, <br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t actually verbal speaking to us until he was about <br/>\nnearly 2. I guessed I must have been so intuned with my kid, maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s telepathy - I&#39;ve read somewhere it&#39;s possible LOL!!! Now at age <br/>\n8, he&#39;s a talkative, not stop hyper ball of opinions and views. My <br/>\nchild is hyperlexic. He was reading at age 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe refused to conform to all the standard school expectations and <br/>\nrules, so we took him out of school, and allow him to grow according <br/>\nto his own natural agenda.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you see, the expectations and views back home in Asia, is so much <br/>\nmore basic and simple. I hope this helps to lighten up your burden. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling a child with significant developmental delays","postDate":"1223003941","msgId":39048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1MTI1MC41Njg1OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39043,"nextInTopic":39051,"prevInTime":39047,"nextInTime":39049,"topicId":38754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are other parents with autistic kids that radically unschool.

She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t speak to the issue, but often with a verbal and written <br/>\nlanguage processing difficulty, comes an inablity to understand non-<br/>\nverbal/body language also. That means they don&#39;t have the ability <br/>\nto pick up anything without explicitly teaching it to them. <br/>\nAnything. My son didn&#39;t understand what Yes and No meant until he <br/>\nwas 5. He didn&#39;t have the ability to ask ANY kind of question at <br/>\nall until he was 6, and so far, the only questions he is able to ask <br/>\nare &quot;what is that?&quot; and his ability to ask &quot;where is that?&quot; is still <br/>\nemerging. It will likely be a few years to get to &quot;why is that?&quot; <br/>\nbecause it is a higher level skill. I think one of the foundations <br/>\nof being able to truly unschool and have child led learning is that <br/>\nthey can ask questions. Simply reading to the child and playing <br/>\npuppets are so insanely pointless I don&#39;t even know where to begin. <br/>\nIn this case, the only thing that is doing is making the parent feel <br/>\nlike they are doing something, but they aren&#39;t accomplishing squat. <br/>\nIt is just noise to the child who can&#39;t process language.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the books at John Holt&#39;s first arguement for child led <br/>\nlearning and unschooling. It is that kids learn language with us <br/>\njust facilitating the process, so why do we assume that they need <br/>\nanything except our facilitating for all of their other learning <br/>\ntoo. Well, my child did not learn language without explicit <br/>\nintervention. If I had waited, he would still be unable to <br/>\ncommunicate (even to tell me that he is hungry) and totally unable <br/>\nto navigate things that come naturally to my typically developing 2 <br/>\nyear old. Your base assumption is not true for all kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of jargon was intentional. If you are looking for ways to <br/>\nhelp facilitate a particularly rare learning style, it gets you to <br/>\nthe infomation a lot faster if you have the correct terms to <br/>\ngoogle. Much like you used &quot;unschooling&quot; as a label for this forum, <br/>\nif you are looking for support for the issue she was looking for, <br/>\nthe term &quot;hyperlexic&quot; is going to help, as are terms like &quot;phonetic <br/>\nawareness&quot;, &quot;word attack&quot; (how somebody pronounces words, not some <br/>\nviolent thing), &quot;social stories&quot;, &quot;PECs&quot;, and &quot;Visual Schedules&quot; I <br/>\nwill not apologize for using the technical terms because they are <br/>\nthere for a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responses illustrate exactly why parents of special needs kids <br/>\ncan feel so frustrated and alone. I know that I agonized trying to <br/>\ndo radical, pure unschooling with my autistic child. I have <br/>\nfollowed John Holts writings for a good 11 years before even having <br/>\nchildren, and I was commited to it, so was the other mom I <br/>\nmentioned. It wasn&#39;t working. Our kids didn&#39;t have the tools to be <br/>\nable to learn. He isn&#39;t able to move his body (hold a scissors, <br/>\npull up his pants, give a thumbs up sign) without somebody else <br/>\nworking with him, hand over hand, and gradually removing the direct <br/>\nsupports. He was frustrated, but since he couldn&#39;t read body <br/>\nlangage, he couldn&#39;t just watch somebody else do it and infer how to <br/>\ndo it himself. He couldn&#39;t just listen to somebody else speak and <br/>\ninfer how to do it himself. It is just not even in the same <br/>\nballpark. With help, he is moving towards the ability to initiate <br/>\nthe learning process, moving towards unschooling, but unlike <br/>\ntypically developing kids, he needs help to get to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Curriculm&quot; isn&#39;t a bad word. It doesn&#39;t mean we sit down and drill <br/>\nfor hours on end, it means they have cohesive, concrete strategies <br/>\nfor helping somebody learn. It isn&#39;t a religion...you don&#39;t have to <br/>\ndo it &quot;just so&quot; for it to be valuable and effective. You modify it <br/>\nfor your family&#39;s needs. The OP mentioned her dd was struggling <br/>\nwith basic math concepts, and all of those issues go back to <br/>\ncomprehending what a number actually is, how numbers compare to each <br/>\nother and relate to eachother. Miquon is not a kill and drill, like <br/>\nmost math curriculms. It addresses, directly, exactly what her dd <br/>\nseems to be struggling with...basic number concepts. It uses visual <br/>\nsupports and manipulatives that make sense to let the child discover <br/>\nthe concepts through play. One of my son&#39;s favorite things to do is <br/>\nplay around and build with the cusinairre rods and the bucket of <br/>\nshapes he has. He has developed a spatial awareness that would <br/>\nrival most adults playing around with Miquon stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other curriculm I mentioned addresses, very directly, <br/>\ncomprehension issues, and it does it in a different way than <br/>\nanything else I have seen. I don&#39;t sit down and drill with that <br/>\neither, but it gave me a new, simple, strategy to help him develop <br/>\nlanguage and comprehension as we go through the day (I take the key <br/>\nwords and keep them on a binder ring in my pocket so that I can pull <br/>\nthem out and flip through them and help him organize his thoughts). <br/>\nAs he progresses, there are a lot more things we can do, but, again, <br/>\njust because somebody wrote it down in a book instead of a website <br/>\nfor unschooling does not suddenly transform it to being evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the frustration of the OP, even if I don&#39;t have a grasp <br/>\non the exact issues she is facing as an individual. I understand <br/>\nhow difficult it is when you have tried everything you can think to <br/>\ntry and nothing is reaching your child. I understand what it means <br/>\nto cry out for help and have people suggest things that you tried <br/>\nyears ago, to no avail. I know what it feels like to be haunted by <br/>\nthe &quot;what if..&quot;s. I especially know what it feels like to be <br/>\ncriticized for my parenting on an almost daily basis by people who <br/>\nhave no clue what real life is like for us...and I get it from a <br/>\nspectrum of people too...I have people tell me I should spank him, <br/>\nuse time outs, yell at him, just &quot;let him suffer the natural <br/>\nconsequenses&quot; even though his sensory system won&#39;t send the message <br/>\nthat &quot;my toes are hurting from the cold, maybe I should put on shoes <br/>\nfor the snow&quot;, give him more structure, give him less structure, <br/>\ngive him charts and stickers and graphs, don&#39;t praise him because <br/>\nthen he will rely on outside confirmation. ..every angle, I am doing <br/>\nit &quot;wrong&quot; according to just about everybody. Well, everybody <br/>\nexcept a few speech therapist and other moms of SN kids that also <br/>\nfeel isolated and like there is no place to turn and there are no <br/>\nanswers. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way I can make the onlookers really understand within <br/>\nthe context of a post, but I do want to tell the OP, and others also <br/>\nstruggling, that there are ways to reach your kids, almost everybody <br/>\nis capable of learning if given the right tools, it just sometimes <br/>\ntakes a while to find the tools that work. You can&#39;t be so stuck on <br/>\na dogma that you close yourself off to other possibilities. Some <br/>\nkids don&#39;t fit the mold, so you break the mold and you find what <br/>\nworks in your situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nPS...I went to the &quot;Autism and Video Games&quot; link. I agree with the <br/>\nposter that support the child following his passion. Video and <br/>\ncomputer games have been a major part of helping my son to learn to <br/>\nread, learn about life, and make connections with people. Cutting <br/>\nhim off from electronics would be like cutting him off from the <br/>\nair and I won&#39;t do it. Not only does he play games with us, but <br/>\nwith friends and my parents (Mennonite, if that gives you an idea of <br/>\nhow much they understand how important this is to him). He can beat <br/>\na lot of adults at games, and I think that is pretty cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just think there is a place for learning how to put on clothes and <br/>\nbrush your teeth and get a snack for yourself. You don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nthese things at a particular time, or even every day, but you should <br/>\nknow how to do them. Even if he isn&#39;t able to live independently, <br/>\nhe will still need to know how to do these things in a group home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am far, far more concerned with him keeping his happy, sweet <br/>\nspirit than any skill. It is why I pulled him out of school (which <br/>\nI only did because I lost faith in myself for a while) ...he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t coping at all and I wasn&#39;t going to force that on him because <br/>\nit would destroy who he is. I just know that he is happier when he <br/>\ncan get his needs met, and helping him learn how to communicate <br/>\nthose needs is far more important than any academic subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk...I need to just stop typing because it isn&#39;t like I am finding a <br/>\nnice way to wrap this up. lol<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling a child with significant developmental delays","postDate":"1222998062","msgId":39043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVFMzUzRTBELTkzMTEtNDg5QS04QzQxLTI4OURGMUYwNTVGQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjM2Y3Yys4OG1xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdjM2Y3Yys4OG1xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39040,"nextInTopic":39048,"prevInTime":39042,"nextInTime":39044,"topicId":38754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I just think there is a place for learning how to put on clothes and brush your teeth and get a snack for yourself.

Much like you used &quot;unschooling&quot; as a label for this forum, <br/>\nif you are looking for support for the issue she was looking for, <br/>\nthe term &quot;hyperlexic&quot; is going to help, as are terms like &quot;phonetic <br/>\nawareness&quot;, &quot;word attack&quot; (how somebody pronounces words, not some <br/>\nviolent thing), &quot;social stories&quot;, &quot;PECs&quot;, and &quot;Visual Schedules&quot;  I <br/>\nwill not apologize for using the technical terms because they are <br/>\nthere for a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responses illustrate exactly why parents of special needs kids <br/>\ncan feel so frustrated and alone.  I know that I agonized trying to <br/>\ndo radical, pure unschooling with my autistic child.  I have <br/>\nfollowed John Holts writings for a good 11 years before even having <br/>\nchildren, and I was commited to it, so was the other mom I <br/>\nmentioned.  It wasn&#39;t working.  Our kids didn&#39;t have the tools to be <br/>\nable to learn.  He isn&#39;t able to move his body (hold a scissors, <br/>\npull up his pants, give a thumbs up sign) without somebody else <br/>\nworking with him, hand over hand, and gradually removing the direct <br/>\nsupports.  He was frustrated, but since he couldn&#39;t read body <br/>\nlangage, he couldn&#39;t just watch somebody else do it and infer how to <br/>\ndo it himself.  He couldn&#39;t just listen to somebody else speak and <br/>\ninfer how to do it himself.  It is just not even in the same <br/>\nballpark.  With help, he is moving towards the ability to initiate <br/>\nthe learning process, moving towards unschooling, but unlike <br/>\ntypically developing kids, he needs help to get to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Curriculm&quot; isn&#39;t a bad word.  It doesn&#39;t mean we sit down and drill <br/>\nfor hours on end, it means they have cohesive, concrete strategies <br/>\nfor helping somebody learn.  It isn&#39;t a religion...you don&#39;t have to <br/>\ndo it &quot;just so&quot; for it to be valuable and effective.  You modify it <br/>\nfor your family&#39;s needs.  The OP mentioned her dd was struggling <br/>\nwith basic math concepts, and all of those issues go back to <br/>\ncomprehending what a number actually is, how numbers compare to each <br/>\nother and relate to eachother.  Miquon is not a kill and drill, like <br/>\nmost math curriculms.  It addresses, directly, exactly what her dd <br/>\nseems to be struggling with...basic number concepts.  It uses visual <br/>\nsupports and manipulatives that make sense to let the child discover <br/>\nthe concepts through play.  One of my son&#39;s favorite things to do is <br/>\nplay around and build with the cusinairre rods and the bucket of <br/>\nshapes he has.  He has developed a spatial awareness that would <br/>\nrival most adults playing around with Miquon stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other curriculm I mentioned addresses, very directly, <br/>\ncomprehension issues, and it does it in a different way than <br/>\nanything else I have seen.  I don&#39;t sit down and drill with that <br/>\neither, but it gave me a new, simple, strategy to help him develop <br/>\nlanguage and comprehension as we go through the day (I take the key <br/>\nwords and keep them on a binder ring in my pocket so that I can pull <br/>\nthem out and flip through them and help him organize his thoughts).  <br/>\nAs he progresses, there are a lot more things we can do, but, again, <br/>\njust because somebody wrote it down in a book instead of a website <br/>\nfor unschooling does not suddenly transform it to being evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the frustration of the OP, even if I don&#39;t have a grasp <br/>\non the exact issues she is facing as an individual.  I understand <br/>\nhow difficult it is when you have tried everything you can think to <br/>\ntry and nothing is reaching your child. I understand what it means <br/>\nto cry out for help and have people suggest things that you tried <br/>\nyears ago, to no avail.  I know what it feels like to be haunted by <br/>\nthe &quot;what if..&quot;s.  I especially know what it feels like to be <br/>\ncriticized for my parenting on an almost daily basis by people who <br/>\nhave no clue what real life is like for us...and I get it from a <br/>\nspectrum of people too...I have people tell me I should spank him, <br/>\nuse time outs, yell at him, just &quot;let him suffer the natural <br/>\nconsequenses&quot; even though his sensory system won&#39;t send the message <br/>\nthat &quot;my toes are hurting from the cold, maybe I should put on shoes <br/>\nfor the snow&quot;, give him more structure, give him less structure, <br/>\ngive him charts and stickers and graphs, don&#39;t praise him because <br/>\nthen he will rely on outside confirmation...every angle, I am doing <br/>\nit &quot;wrong&quot; according to just about everybody.  Well, everybody <br/>\nexcept a few speech therapist and other moms of SN kids that also <br/>\nfeel isolated and like there is no place to turn and there are no <br/>\nanswers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way I can make the onlookers really understand within <br/>\nthe context of a post, but I do want to tell the OP, and others also <br/>\nstruggling, that there are ways to reach your kids, almost everybody <br/>\nis capable of learning if given the right tools, it just sometimes <br/>\ntakes a while to find the tools that work.  You can&#39;t be so stuck on <br/>\na dogma that you close yourself off to other possibilities.  Some <br/>\nkids don&#39;t fit the mold, so you break the mold and you find what <br/>\nworks in your situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nPS...I went to the &quot;Autism and Video Games&quot; link.  I agree with the <br/>\nposter that support the child following his passion.  Video and <br/>\ncomputer games have been a major part of helping my son to learn to <br/>\nread, learn about life, and make connections with people.  Cutting <br/>\nhim off from electronics would be like cutting him off from the <br/>\nair and I won&#39;t do it.  Not only does he play games with us, but <br/>\nwith friends and my parents (Mennonite, if that gives you an idea of <br/>\nhow much they understand how important this is to him).  He can beat <br/>\na lot of adults at games, and I think that is pretty cool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just think there is a place for learning how to put on clothes and <br/>\nbrush your teeth and get a snack for yourself.  You don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nthese things at a particular time, or even every day, but you should <br/>\nknow how to do them.  Even if he isn&#39;t able to live independently, <br/>\nhe will still need to know how to do these things in a group home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am far, far more concerned with him keeping his happy, sweet <br/>\nspirit than any skill.  It is why I pulled him out of school (which <br/>\nI only did because I lost faith in myself for a while) ...he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t coping at all and I wasn&#39;t going to force that on him because <br/>\nit would destroy who he is.  I just know that he is happier when he <br/>\ncan get his needs met, and helping him learn how to communicate <br/>\nthose needs is far more important than any academic subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk...I need to just stop typing because it isn&#39;t like I am finding a <br/>\nnice way to wrap this up. lol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"&quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling a child with significant developmental delays","postDate":"1222950716","msgId":38998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjMmV2cytkdTJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM5MjA0ZiQzNjllYzVkMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBNb21zTGFwdG9wPg=="},"prevInTopic":38984,"nextInTopic":39040,"prevInTime":38997,"nextInTime":38999,"topicId":38754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Because someone linked one of the pages from this section of my website (a little-used corner, which I ve gone and dusted and repaired links on this morning),","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1161835457\">Because someone linked one of the pages from this section of my website (a little-used <br/>\ncorner, which I&#39;ve gone and dusted and repaired links on this morning), I was reminded of <br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo Games and Autism<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames\">http://sandradodd.com/special/videogames</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling a child with significant developmental delays","postDate":"1222873248","msgId":38984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBQjQ2MzFGLUZFMDYtNDA1Qi04MjZDLTc0QTc0QjU0OEJEQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCNEQyOTA1LUZGMEQtNDRDRC04ODQxLUM3Rjg5QTJGODRFRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGdidXBpcisxMDVrYkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDlCNEQyOTA1LUZGMEQtNDRDRC04ODQxLUM3Rjg5QTJGODRFRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":38981,"nextInTopic":38998,"prevInTime":38983,"nextInTime":38985,"topicId":38754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Working on ...

That&#39;s one of the concepts  <br/>\nunschoolers need to let go of for natural learning to flourish. It  <br/>\ncan be hard for unschoolers to see a 12 yo who is not reading. It  <br/>\nhelps a lot to know that many unschooled kids -- though not all and  <br/>\nnot the majority! ;-) -- have passed through that and do eventually  <br/>\nread fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard being a pioneer. Often the only friends a pioneer has are  <br/>\ntheir certainty and determination. But for those who lack what&#39;s  <br/>\nnecessary to be pioneers themselves, the pioneers are often happy to  <br/>\nhelp others who follow in the trail they&#39;ve blazed. The pioneers are  <br/>\nout there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Right now we are putting some of the traditional academics aside to<br/>\n&gt; try and work on his various language processing issues and self help<br/>\n&gt; skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An unschooling approach isn&#39;t to work on skills. Which shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\ninterpreted as doing nothing. Unschoolers incorporate their help into  <br/>\ntheir kids lives as issues come up. They give their kids some help  <br/>\nbefore an event where they know from past experience the child might  <br/>\nhave difficulties in. They give help during the event. They talk  <br/>\nabout it afterward. Being there to help and support is a seamless  <br/>\npart of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big difference is they aren&#39;t seeing their child as needing to be  <br/>\nat x level of competency so they need to work with the child, but  <br/>\nthey will see a child struggling to do something and step in with the  <br/>\noffer of some other tools that might work better. (And one tool might  <br/>\nbe to leave and try again some other time.) Rather than moving a  <br/>\nchild to a goal the mother feels is necessary, the approach is &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>\nhere to help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The issue you described, where the reading level (word attack,<br/>\n&gt; phonics, ect) is considerably above their comprehension is<br/>\n&gt; termed &quot;hyperlexic&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether or not they&#39;re recognizing words, if they aren&#39;t  <br/>\ncomprehending, they&#39;re not reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, when kids need to read independently by 4th grade, the  <br/>\nmyriad ways a child might not be reading is important for teachers  <br/>\nwho must get those kids reading. (No one should assume that teachers  <br/>\nactually accomplish that! Special Ed takes the failures and removes  <br/>\nthem from the teacher&#39;s list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter wrote well before she could read. There might be a label  <br/>\nfor that in school so the teacher could channel her off to the proper  <br/>\nspecial reading instruction. At home, it was just her approach and  <br/>\nnow at 17 you&#39;d never know she had that special &quot;issue&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers there&#39;s reading (which means comprehending) and not  <br/>\nreading (which means not comprehending) and a sliding scale between  <br/>\nas the child moves from not reading/comprehending towards reading/ <br/>\ncomprehending. (Though comprehension is more of a fuzzy concept than  <br/>\nschools suggest. But if an unschooled child is picking up something  <br/>\nto read, they&#39;re comprehending well enough to satisfy themselves.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Working on<br/>\n&gt; comprehension and sequencing is a huge part of what I do with my<br/>\n&gt; ds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And had I done that with my non-autistic daughter before she was  <br/>\nready to read, she would have felt there was something wrong with  <br/>\nher. There are several typical responses to that atmosphere. A child  <br/>\ncan internalize a feeling of being incompetent and needful of others  <br/>\nto make them right. A child can decide they&#39;re dumb and can&#39;t do it.  <br/>\nA child, with a strong sense of self preservation, can decide the  <br/>\nthing they can&#39;t do is dumb so why should they try?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy imposing help to do something a child isn&#39;t ready (or wanting) to  <br/>\ndo, the mom is saying through her actions that the child  is  <br/>\ndefective and not meeting the mom&#39;s standards. It makes no difference  <br/>\nif that thought is far from the mom&#39;s mind. It&#39;s what the actions say  <br/>\nto the child and words can&#39;t negate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I use them a<br/>\n&gt; lot to make picture schedules, social stories (although I don&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; them the &#39;standard&#39; way, for me it is basically taking the task and<br/>\n&gt; breaking it down into the smallest possible pieces, like &quot;spit in<br/>\n&gt; sink&quot; is one of the tasks for the &quot;brushing teeth&quot; story, and &quot;look<br/>\n&gt; at face&quot; is a task in the &quot;how to say hi&quot; story), and visual to-do<br/>\n&gt; lists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which might be useful for some kids. But an unschooler approaches  <br/>\nfrom a different mindset. Instead of seeing where the child is not up  <br/>\nto par, an unschooler sees where her child is struggling and finds  <br/>\nways to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWritten out like that, it sounds subtle, but it&#39;s profound because it  <br/>\nbegins with &quot;I&#39;m here to help,&quot; rather than, &quot;I need to work to get  <br/>\nyou to point x.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have had good luck with Miquon Math (uses Cuisinairre Rods)<br/>\n&gt; because it depends much more on visual than most of the other math<br/>\n&gt; programs I have seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, there seems to be a goal of comprehension by some deadline.  <br/>\nHad I looked for some particular level of competency in math as my  <br/>\ndaughter grew, I might be drawn to some program too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is tricky to learn. Not because it&#39;s hard -- it&#39;s actually  <br/>\npretty easy -- but because what&#39;s learned out of context often  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t translate to real life, or even another program. Becoming  <br/>\ncompetent at a program doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the child understands  <br/>\nthe way numbers work in real life. But programs can make the mother  <br/>\nfeel she&#39;s doing her job.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s true of language too. A child can sit through Spanish class,  <br/>\nmemorizing a few hundred words, demonstrating a competency at putting  <br/>\nthem in the right order, and yet not be able to answer a question  <br/>\nasked in the language out in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see in your approach is academic and social skills being  <br/>\npulled out of context and worked on. That&#39;s what schools do. An  <br/>\nunschooling approach is to help the child do what *they&#39;re* trying to  <br/>\ndo in context.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling a child with significant developmental delays","postDate":"1222857833","msgId":38980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDAxMDM0M2k0ZDM2N2VhY3FkZTEzYjkxZjdhM2ZhMTdmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0NjY0OTA1LTgzRDMtNEM1MS04MjIyLTE1NEVFRUE4NzVFMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGdidXBpcisxMDVrYkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JIDwwNDY2NDkwNS04M0QzLTRDNTEtODIyMi0xNTRFRUVBODc1RTFAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38974,"nextInTopic":38981,"prevInTime":38979,"nextInTime":38981,"topicId":38754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gee I must have been hyperlexic.

Pure <br/>\nunschooling for them just wasn&#39;t working for our auties.  When I <br/>\nwent to read what John Holt had to say on the subject, the example <br/>\nthat was given of homeschooling an autistic child was not <br/>\nunschooling, it was more traditional, structured homeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have found that a traditional curriculm does not work very <br/>\nwell either because it has to be very visual and very hands on.  <br/>\nRight now we are putting some of the traditional academics aside to <br/>\ntry and work on his various language processing issues and self help <br/>\nskills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue you described, where the reading level (word attack, <br/>\nphonics, ect) is considerably above their comprehension is <br/>\ntermed &quot;hyperlexic&quot;.

Working on <br/>\ncomprehension and sequencing is a huge part of what I do with my <br/>\nds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that he really struggles with auditory <br/>\nprocessing/language processing, but can understand visual supports a <br/>\nlot better, so I do a LOT of visual supports.  You can find a lot of <br/>\ninformation on PECS (Picture Exchange Communication), which can be <br/>\nused with totally non-verbal kids, but are also really useful for <br/>\nverbal, but with difficulty with language processing.  I use them a <br/>\nlot to make picture schedules, social stories (although I don&#39;t do <br/>\nthem the &#39;standard&#39; way, for me it is basically taking the task and <br/>\nbreaking it down into the smallest possible pieces, like &quot;spit in <br/>\nsink&quot; is one of the tasks for the &quot;brushing teeth&quot; story, and &quot;look <br/>\nat face&quot; is a task in the &quot;how to say hi&quot; story), and visual to-do <br/>\nlists.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had good luck with Miquon Math (uses Cuisinairre Rods) <br/>\nbecause it depends much more on visual than most of the other math <br/>\nprograms I have seen.  It is often used for remedial math and isn&#39;t <br/>\ndumbed down or obviously for young kids, so that might be a plus for <br/>\nyou.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of what you are describing are issues that a lot of autistics <br/>\nface, so googling info on homeschooling and autism or autism <br/>\nlearning sites might help, even if it isn&#39;t an exact fit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do think that autism might fit, you might look at <br/>\nGreenspan&#39;s &quot;Engaging Autism&quot; a bit.

The younger four are internationally <br/>\nadopted (China) and are 15, 13, 12 and 11 year old girls.   Our <br/>\nfifteen year old, who joined our family at age 6.5 years, has <br/>\nsignificant learning/developmental issues that have baffled us since <br/>\nher adoption in 1999.     Some basic conclusions we&#39;ve reached after <br/>\nlots of consultation with therapists in an effort to find out what <br/>\nis going on is that she has a profound language processing disorder <br/>\ncomplicated by a low-IQ.  Now, I have got to say that I am not <br/>\nsomeone who puts a whole lot of stock in IQ tests.     Nor do I have <br/>\na lot of faith in therapists.    But, given our long-time experience <br/>\nin parenting, homeschooling, and international adoption, this child <br/>\nhas baffled us.    She struggles with learning things that were <br/>\nnever problems for any of the other kids, and she presents to the <br/>\nworld as a child with major problems, but she doesn&#39;t fit any mold <br/>\nthat we can easily understand.    We have been reluctant to submit <br/>\nher to too much testing, because we don&#39;t want to add to her already <br/>\nevident insecurities.   We do suspect that she may have had a brain <br/>\ninjury at some time before her adoption based on the type of <br/>\nlanguage problems she experiences, and there is more we will never <br/>\nknow because of lack of knowledge of her biological family&#39;s health <br/>\nissues, her birth history, and her life prior to her entering the <br/>\norphanage in China when she was three years old.    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But we struggle about how to help her move toward a time when she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>might hope to live somewhat independently.   If she were clearly <br/>\ndevelopmentally delayed, it would be obvious that she would not be <br/>\nable to live independently and we would be looking towards some type <br/>\nof sheltered work/living environment.    But she&#39;s not in that <br/>\ncategory.    If she were in school, she would probably be diagnosed <br/>\nas a slow learner (possibly borderline retarded, but more likely <br/>\nslightly above that level), with a huge language processing <br/>\ndisorder.   Our primary therapist has said we should not consider <br/>\npublic school ever because our daughter would fall into a huge gap <br/>\narea of lack of service.    The speech pathologists we&#39;ve seen have <br/>\nsaid that the low IQ severely complicates any hope of making much <br/>\nprogress on the language processing disorder.   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; She does not &quot;learn&quot; in the way that the other kids learn.   She <br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t pick things up by normal exposure in an active, involved <br/>\nfamily.    Even clear instruction isn&#39;t working in many areas.   For <br/>\nexample, she&#39;s never been able to learn to handle money.    Lots of <br/>\nboard games, lots of exposure to the use of money in shopping, <br/>\nhasn&#39;t clicked.   She can&#39;t grasp the concept of time......she can <br/>\ntell the time with a digital clock but not grasp how much time <br/>\nelapses during activities.    Example:  if you go to a two-hour <br/>\nmovie that starts at 4 p.m., when will the movie be over?   If she <br/>\nhas $5 in her wallet and the movie costs $6, does she have enough <br/>\nmoney to go to the movie?
