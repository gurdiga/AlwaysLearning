But somewhere I felt a<br/>\nbit connected regarding my son Ishaan who is almost five now. He is a pretty<br/>\nimaginative child and has never been to school. He has always got along<br/>\nbetter with older boys than with boys his age. So when we have kids his age<br/>\nor perhaps girls his age come over or meet at other people&#39;s places, he<br/>\nfinds it difficult to find a game to his liking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of his games are creations of his favourite movies like those Night in<br/>\nthe Musuem, Madagascar or simply playing the engine driver of his<br/>\ninnumerable trains. Now most kids his age are not willing to play those kind<br/>\nof games. One reason I figured out for that was that many of the moms<br/>\nrestrict their kids to a single room. Whereas my kids have the whole house<br/>\nto play in. The other kids are at loss of &quot;what to do all the time in one<br/>\ncrammy room?&quot; . when their friends come over to our place I generally close<br/>\nmyself into my study and let them use the rest of the house except my<br/>\nbedroom. I do not mind cleaning up later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys who come over sometime are happy playing the usual hide and seek or<br/>\nsome board game. Now my kids play other games of their own invention. so<br/>\nwhen Ishaan cannot communicate this to those kids he generally throws a<br/>\ntantrum. I try and mitigate by saying to the other kids  &quot;this is what he<br/>\nmeans&quot; My daughter who is 9 also helps in such situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also explain to Ishaan sometimes you have to play their kind of games<br/>\ntoo or else no one might want to come over to our place. Otherwise I just<br/>\nput on his favourite show on TV or DVD and let him not play at all. My<br/>\ndaughter is the follower by nature, so she continues to play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I too feel it does get a bit out of hand at times when Ishaan just<br/>\nscreams or throws things around when no one wants to play his game. Any<br/>\nsuggestions how to handle it better and more effectively...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep in mind that all their friends go to school and have pretty<br/>\nstrict rules to follow at home....<br/>\n<br/>\nDola<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, Dec 31, 2010 at 4:56 AM, plaidpanties666<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; k &lt;katherand@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The idea that a child has annoyed people enough that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others don&#39;t invite the family/child to events seems a bit ...

As the step-parent, I got to hear the details sooner and<br/>\n&gt; find out what was going on and essentially Ray was acting as a bully most of<br/>\n&gt; the time. Once we started being supportive of him the bullying went away -<br/>\n&gt; he wasn&#39;t &quot;trying to be mean&quot; - at least not at first - but trying to<br/>\n&gt; communicate and get his needs met and doing that badly. I say &quot;at least not<br/>\n&gt; at first&quot; because once he started having a reputation as &quot;the mean kid&quot; he<br/>\n&gt; took that on as a personal trait - as &quot;the mean kid&quot; there was no need to<br/>\n&gt; even Try to be anything else. Yikes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, one thing that might also help this family is looking for older<br/>\n&gt; kids and adults for their son to play with - people old enough that they can<br/>\n&gt; be supportive of the child, can follow his lead without rancour.

So he&#39;s doing what people do in chaotic situations, he&#39;s trying to<br/>\nCreate a sense of control by lashing out - just as though he were in an abusive<br/>\nenvironment or a war zone.

One of them has an ODD<br/>\ndiagnosis... and I have never agreed with the diagnosis. The oppositional<br/>\nsymptoms only occur during her unstable mood states. When she started taking<br/>\na mood stabilizer, she stopped physically striking out at us, and the verbal<br/>\naggression decreased immensely. Her mood cycles last abbout 7 to 16 days,<br/>\nand for about one third of the time, she was incredibly out of control of<br/>\nherself, and felt very badly about herself.

We have discovered that if we assume that<br/>\noppositional responses mean anxiety, it leaves us (the parents) responsible<br/>\nto do the detective work on behalf of our child who is not really able to<br/>\nthink clearly for herself in the momemt. Sometimes there are clear triggers<br/>\nwe can observe : a change in plans leads to oppositional behaviors. Other<br/>\ntimes we don&#39;t see clear reasons, and sometimes we can find patterns that<br/>\nlead us to clues as to what is provoking the anxiety: the last 4 episodes<br/>\noccurred while getting into the car after leaving a store or an activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNagging our sullen oppositional anxious child to do something, makes things<br/>\nworse. When I am in a hurry to get somewhere, I give lots of time<br/>\ncheckpoints (15 minutes till we leave, 5 minutes... etc) and still at the<br/>\nlast minute, things may &quot;blow out&quot; At that point...

I know when Ray was having trouble, before we were unschooling or even moving toward unschooling, people often didn&#39;t tell his biological parents when there were issues until things got to &quot;he can&#39;t play here any more&quot;. As the step-parent, I got to hear the details sooner and find out what was going on and essentially Ray was acting as a bully most of the time. Once we started being supportive of him the bullying went away - he wasn&#39;t &quot;trying to be mean&quot; - at least not at first - but trying to communicate and get his needs met and doing that badly. I say &quot;at least not at first&quot; because once he started having a reputation as &quot;the mean kid&quot; he took that on as a personal trait - as &quot;the mean kid&quot; there was no need to even Try to be anything else. Yikes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, one thing that might also help this family is looking for older kids and adults for their son to play with - people old enough that they can be supportive of the child, can follow his lead without rancour. That was a big, big help to Ray and he&#39;s still friends with some of those adults to this day. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:oppositional defiant disorder","postDate":"1293730687","msgId":58599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI0QTk4MTkyLUUzNEUtNEY2OC04QTIzLUE3M0RCMTFFOURFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlmaTZjdis0Z3BhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlmaTZjdis0Z3BhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58598,"nextInTopic":58600,"prevInTime":58598,"nextInTime":58600,"topicId":58561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Yes, Glasser *seems* to give control to the child--it is his/her choice to act according to the rules parents/teachers have set up, and they aren t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1047535967\">-=-Yes, Glasser *seems* to give control to the child--it is his/her choice to act according to the rules parents/teachers have set up, and they aren&#39;t &quot;punished&quot; when they fail to act accordingly, which *is* a huge plus in terms of behavior modification practices.

GABOR MATÉ: Well, it&#39;s a great question. You see, when we hear the phrase &quot;acting out,&quot; we usually mean that a kid is behaving badly, that a child is being obstreperous, oppositional, violent, bullying, rude. That&#39;s because we don&#39;t know how to speak English anymore. The phrase &quot;acting out&quot; means you&#39;re portraying behavior that which you haven&#39;t got the words to say in language. In a game of charades, you have to act out, because you&#39;re not allowed to speak. If you landed in a country where nobody spoke your language and you were hungry, you would have to literally demonstrate your angersorry, your hunger, through behavior, pointing to your mouth or to your empty belly, because you don&#39;t have the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that, yes, a lot of children are acting out, but it&#39;s not bad behavior. It&#39;s a representation of emotional losses and emotional lacks in their lives. And whether it&#39;s, again, bullying or a whole set of other behaviors, what we&#39;re dealing with here is childhood stunted emotional developmentin some cases, stunted pain development. And rather than trying to control these behaviors through punishments, or even just exclusively through medications, we need to help these kids develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: re:oppositional defiant disorder","postDate":"1293662373","msgId":58590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlmZ2RiNStidm05QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2Njk1Ni4xMDA4NC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58588,"nextInTopic":58591,"prevInTime":58589,"nextInTime":58591,"topicId":58561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have one son, of my 4 kids that I would say people might consider intense.

He is more sensitive in many ways than my other kids and I need to be more aware of cues and anticipate situation more with him.  <br/>\nWe had a friend spend the night tuesday night, wednesday he didnt leave till about 2.  His mother asked if I might watch him and his sister today.  I knew, knowing my son, that this was alot of company time for him.  He needs breaks when it comes to people, he needs his space.  This has gotten better over the past few years, mainly due to our acceptance of our son for who he is and a conscious descision to view him as a unique individual and not someone that needs to be fixed.  So when we have alot of company, I make sure that Ben has a space to retreat too.. he can always leave the group and play on the computer or come to my room and watch t.v or read or whatever.  Today he retreated to my room and hid in his sleeping bag.. I brought him a rootbeer and pretzels and he was better not too long later.  My mother makes comments quite often about how we treat my son, implying and outright saying that we are spoiling him.  But I havnt always treated him this way.  When he was little I thought alot about how he was different, how we could &quot;fix&quot; him and he was misserable, cried alot, had tantrums, lashed out.  And now, he really doesnt and a child who said no all the time, no longer has a reason to.  He is also so much more cooperative when I really need/want him to be.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383546898,"authorName":"Sadie Bugni","from":"Sadie Bugni &lt;lotsagr8kidz@...&gt;","profile":"mesarylee","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: re:oppositional defiant disorder","postDate":"1293662091","msgId":58591,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMThoLURFSGdvVWhHeC1ZWTg4VjBtcVlIN005MCt6VFgyNHNiNkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE0MEE0RjZBLTc4RjAtNDM5NS1COTU4LTgwNkExMzY2MUMxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlmZnJrbit0ODNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8QTQwQTRGNkEtNzhGMC00Mzk1LUI5NTgtODA2QTEzNjYxQzE0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58590,"nextInTopic":58592,"prevInTime":58590,"nextInTime":58592,"topicId":58561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t usually comment on this board, however, I thought I may be able to offer a perspective from our experiences.

Our now 16yo son has always been<br/>\n&quot;strong willed.&quot;  We began unschooling him in 1st grade, because he had gone<br/>\nto a preparatory school for K, and he was 2 years ahead of the public school<br/>\nkids when we moved. In 3rd grade he decided to try the PS.  They were<br/>\nconcerned that he didn&#39;t respond well to their prompts.  He didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\ntry his best unless I was there helping or watching his presentations.  They<br/>\nthought he possibly had ODD and that he was too attached to me.  After about<br/>\na year (his choice) we went back to unschooling.<br/>\nI remember questioning myself if his behavior was really a problem, but all<br/>\nhe really wanted was to treated with respect. He didn&#39;t like being ordered<br/>\naround by teachers or other kids.  He wasn&#39;t used to being treated that way<br/>\nat home or by our friends.  We tried to be around people that treated kids<br/>\nwith love and respect as individuals.  That&#39;s NOT the atmosphere in school<br/>\nto a child that recognizes injustice.<br/>\nOnce back home he was back to his old self after about 6 months.  During the<br/>\nfirst 6 months, we could not do any classes or anything that resembled<br/>\nschool to him, even though he enjoyed those things.  They brought out an<br/>\noppositional, negative attitude. His relationships with his sibs were very<br/>\nstrained.  About 2 years later I couldn&#39;t even believe that anyone could<br/>\nhave questioned his behavior.  He was such a happy kid, loving life and<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\nThen in 7th grade he decided to try school again.  All his football friends<br/>\nwere in school and they convinced him that middle school was great.  We<br/>\nsupported him.  We all, including him, saw the oppositional attitude emerge<br/>\nonce again.  He left middle school at semester, but the deschooling process<br/>\ntook much longer this time.  I think that for kids who have such a strong<br/>\ninjustice recognition, any request, no, ect. can really seem like a command<br/>\nor a power (control) struggle if not done very delicately.  They really need<br/>\nto know that you really are on their side and want to help them maintain<br/>\ncontrol in their world.  At 16 he now knows that he doesn&#39;t always have<br/>\nrespect for authority.  He feels that being older than him doesn&#39;t<br/>\nautomatically warrant respect. His goal is to one day own his own company<br/>\nbecause he recognizes that he does not enjoy being told what to do.<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, give it time.  After a while of being<br/>\ntreated with respect and freedom and choices, the defiance and oppositional<br/>\nfeelings may go away.  It takes time though.  He may grow up to be a very<br/>\ncaring, empathetic person if he is treated that way now and can see that his<br/>\nparents place value on his happiness.<br/>\nHope this makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Dec 29, 2010 at 2:14 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-&gt;&gt; I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Yes and no.

The routine was fit around his needs, though, and mainly involved things like meals - knowing when he tended to get up and be hungry, I&#39;d make sure to offer him food at predictable intervals even though food was always available. The regularity/predictability seemed to help him a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was also important with Ray to give him looooooots of time and notice to transition... but sort of conversely if there was something coming up that was &quot;iffy&quot; (and his bio mom&#39;s ability to plan tended to be especially &quot;iffy&quot; in those days) we wouldn&#39;t tell him at all. Anticipation was agonizing for him if there wasn&#39;t a clear &quot;as soon as we&#39;re done with lunch X will happen&quot; he&#39;d be a basket case. And if something didn&#39;t happen at all he&#39;d be a wreck for a solid day after. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes the answer cannot be yes and at least 2 times a day (usually far more)...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too many &quot;nos&quot; - parents need to find more ways to say yes, or at least &quot;partial yes&quot;. This child&#39;s needs need to become the priority for awhile, that&#39;s important! Its also very likely something that the whole family will resist - why &quot;should&quot; his needs be more important? But the reality is they are, that when they are not met then Everyone in the family suffers as a result. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the hardest parts of learning to be an unschooling parent is learning to be proactive, and I suspect that&#39;s where these parents are getting stuck, still. They&#39;re still reacting rather than thinking ahead, actively looking for ways to make their child&#39;s life easier. Maybe they&#39;re still resisting the idea that making his life easier is valuable or important - that&#39;s a common point of resistance for many parents because so much of the &quot;parenting wisdom&quot; that floats around is exactly contrary to that sentiment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes and no. People with very easy-going kids don&#39;t have much context for more intense kids, for sure, but at the same time its often very difficult to know which longtime unschoolers have (or had) more intense kids. Part of that is the principles of unschooling don&#39;t change from one set of needs to another, even though the practice may look very different. If these parents are being &quot;passive&quot; then they haven&#39;t gotten a good grasp on those principles! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut part of it, too, is that unschoolers describe children and situations very differently than the norm - and sometimes that can make it seem as though all our kids are perfectly easy-going.

Linnaea had a <br/>\nparticularly hard time between about 4 and 7. It wasn&#39;t constant, it wasn&#39;t all <br/>\nday, every day, but it wasn&#39;t infrequent. One winter it was so bad that I can <br/>\nremember wandering through our nearest city crying. My crying didn&#39;t help. <br/>\nLooking for a label wouldn&#39;t have helped. I think David actually stumbled across <br/>\noperational defiant disorder as a descriptive one day and thought it might be <br/>\napplicable. But what would I do with a label? It wouldn&#39;t give Linnaea cuddles <br/>\nand love when she needed them. It wouldn&#39;t bring her food when she was hungry, <br/>\nhold her and read to her and watch a movie with her when she was tired. It <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do anything but give me something to tell others when I needed an <br/>\nexcuse. She&#39;s tired worked just as effectively. Or something along those lines. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked was being with her, not blaming her, not telling her who or how to <br/>\nbe, not explaining, again, how much the world couldn&#39;t revolve around her. Just <br/>\nbeing with her, being what she needed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a day when I nearly melted down in Toys &#39;R Us. I could feel everything <br/>\ngoing pear shaped and I was tired of everything and all of it was stupid and I <br/>\nwas going to explode. And I stopped and I thought what would help now. And food <br/>\nwould help now. So we went to McDonalds and we got some food and then we came <br/>\nback. If someone said I was having an ODD moment it wouldn&#39;t have helped. Food <br/>\nhelped. Recognising that when shopping in a toystore with two children under 10 <br/>\nI need to have low expectations of speed or decision making helped.  All of <br/>\nthose things took me thinking about how I felt and what worked for Linnaea when <br/>\nshe was unhappy to get me to move forward. All of those things took knowing what <br/>\nhad helped on previous occasions. The more someone knows how to feel better the <br/>\neasier it is for them to find ways to feel better. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking to the child in the moment helps. Sitting with a child more and more and <br/>\nmore helps. Watching for signs of a frustration build up helps. I am very aware <br/>\nof the tone of voice that either Simon or Linnaea have when they are moving <br/>\ntoward frustrated. I am very good at cuddling or leaning in or offering <br/>\nsomething nice in the moment when I hear that tone of voice. Those things make a <br/>\nhuge difference to how peaceful our home is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I couldn&#39;t afford something I would talk about when I could. Write it down on <br/>\na list of things we are saving for. If Simon or Linnaea wanted to go to <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s house I would call and see when we could arrange it. I would see if it <br/>\nwas going to their house that was important or if it was seeing the person. I <br/>\nwould plan a party or a gaming day or a gathering when people could come. The <br/>\nmore those things were being done, the more Simon and Linnaea knew I was <br/>\ninterested in making the things they wanted happen. They were much better at <br/>\nwaiting if they knew I was working for their goals. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA label and drugs and discipline won&#39;t help nearly as much being with the child, <br/>\nhelping the child, not trying to fix the child, just holding (if allowed) loving <br/>\nand being generous and kind and patient. And when it feels impossible to be <br/>\npatient, find a way. That sounds horribly like wait for a miracle, but honestly, <br/>\nif someone can see their disappointment or frustration as something of their own <br/>\nthen maybe it will be easier to be kind and patient than if one looks at it as a <br/>\nreflection on one&#39;s parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is not a normal stress response type thing it is far more then that.
