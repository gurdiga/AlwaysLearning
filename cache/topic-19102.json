Of course, we can&#39;t make out actual words, tho the occasional word or phrase will come in clearly -- must be about wind patterns or something.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe walk by the mid school every time we go to the park -- usually daily in warm weather -- and the only time we ever see kids outside is when they change classes or are running/playing soccer during PE on the field between the school and park.  On occasion, we&#39;ve heard the bell as we walk by.  Andy also thought it was a fire alarm at first.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

We meet at a school.  There has <br/>\nnever been any bells or anything because the school is closed, but last <br/>\nnight they had a &#39;science&quot; night, so there were hundreds of people there <br/>\ngoing from classroom to classroom doing experiments.  At some point, <br/>\nthey rang the bell.  Ashi is our only schooled child there, and she just <br/>\nhung out and didn&#39;t freak.  Taylor and William, who have been to school, <br/>\nwere asking if that was the bell (the bell at their school was <br/>\ndifferent, plus, they mostly school at home).  The four unschooled kids <br/>\nwere freaking out.  Lexie thought it was a fire alarm, and wanted us to <br/>\nall leave.  She finally convinced me to get up and look outside to see <br/>\nif others were evacuating.  They rang the bell twice, once as a warning <br/>\nand once 10 or so minutes later.
