In<br/>\n1911 the state offered a $15 bounty on wolves.   In 1933 the bounty<br/>\nprovision for wolves were removed from the law books, there was simply no<br/>\nlonger any need for it. Just exactly how many wolves were &quot;harvested&quot; in<br/>\nMontana?   In 1884 bounties were paid on 5,450 wolves, in 1885 the number<br/>\nwas 2,224, in 1886 2,587 -- in all, between 1884 and 1933 Montana paid<br/>\nwell over $340,000 in bounty money on some 80,000 wolves. Between the<br/>\nyears of 1850-1920, as part of government policy, over 1.5 million wolves<br/>\nwere shot, trapped, or poisoned.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYowza indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nOther states had bounty&#39;s too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a picture, and old black and white photo of an agent standing<br/>\nnext to a pile of wolf skulls.  It&#39;s bigger and taller than you can<br/>\nimagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago a Wolf pack in the Deer Lodge valley,  the Boulder pack,<br/>\nwas tracked and killed and the pups clubbed, some left to starve, when a<br/>\nrancher lost two calves to wolves.   The Alpha female was a wolf had been<br/>\ncollared in Banff a few years before.   The rancher was fully compensated<br/>\nfor his loss, paid market value even.<br/>\n<br/>\nMontana is still at it today, the killing of wildlife, with legislators<br/>\npushing to end the endangered status of wolves in the pacific northwest<br/>\nAND with a 45 million dollar budget over the next 15 years for the<br/>\nMontana Department of Livestock to harass and kill Yellowstone Bison who<br/>\nwander from the park onto Montana public lands.    The state used 2<br/>\nmillion dollars of taxpayer money last winter to kill 203 Bison. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey claim the threat of brucellosis.   Interestingly, there has never<br/>\nbeen a confirmed case of brucellosis transmission from wild bison.   Wild<br/>\nelk population carry brucellosis  too but the DOL isn&#39;t killing them on<br/>\nbehalf of ranchers because the state of Montana can sell Elk tags and<br/>\nmake a huge profit off out of state hunters every season.    Calves can<br/>\nbe vaccinated against brucellosis and no antigen is detectable in the<br/>\nblood of mature slaughter animals.      <br/>\n<br/>\nRhetoric maybe, but not without reason.   <br/>\nAnd SOMEONE needs to be passionate about injustice in order to effect<br/>\nchange.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, who was out last night at midnight listening to coyotes, because<br/>\nthere were no wolves to be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"wolf essay/poster contest (and rhetoric)","postDate":"1039012985","msgId":11124,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZS4xYzk3OWY3ZS4yYjFmNmU3OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11125,"prevInTime":11123,"nextInTime":11125,"topicId":11124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Perceived as a threat to livestock, wolves have long been persecuted.
