I suppose my fears concern Liam&#39;s tender <br/>\nheart and his very different way of seeing the world, and given those <br/>\nthings, I get concerned about how will survive and thrive when I&#39;m <br/>\nnot close by.  I have fears of people more worldly than Liam making <br/>\nfun of him or taking advantage of him.  And, don&#39;t get me started on <br/>\nthe girl thing!  We&#39;ve certainly talked about the raging hormones <br/>\nhe&#39;ll be dealing with and what the consequences can be of responding <br/>\npurely to hormonal urges to the exclusion of his common sense.  And, <br/>\nhe&#39;s a fairly attractive guy who&#39;s already experienced girls being <br/>\ninterested in him, but he&#39;s completely not interested ... yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I realize (intellectually) that *because* of his tender <br/>\nheart and his very different way of seeing the world he *will* <br/>\nsurvive and thrive!  He believes so very much in himself!!  And, he <br/>\nhas never been one to go along with a crowd, preferring to think for <br/>\nhimself.  So, I treat my fears like the unfounded little annoyances <br/>\nthey are; I keep them to myself (except if anyone should specifically <br/>\nask), ;-) and I don&#39;t let them frighten me into interfering with who <br/>\nLiam is.  (The few times I have attempted this interference, he&#39;s <br/>\ncaught me at it and called me on the carpet, and, like some corny <br/>\nmovie script, the issue turned out just as *he* thought it would, and <br/>\nhe would legitimately say, &quot;I told you so, Mom.&quot;  I would nod, and he <br/>\nwould smile tolerantly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trusting the raging hormonal thing will go fairly that way, <br/>\ntoo.  Liam has a very strong sense of self-preservation and has never <br/>\nbeen one to take foolish chances.  And, he is *no* fool!  In fact, we <br/>\nhave a few real-life examples of folks in our extended family dealing <br/>\nwith those consequences, and he is loath to become a dad by the time <br/>\nhe&#39;s 17 or a three-time dad by 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you asked, and those are the fears I&#39;m confessing to.
