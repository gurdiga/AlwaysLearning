I m glad you asked because ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1264071908\">Hi Penny!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked for us to tell about our kids ages and how long we&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling, and what a typical day is like?  I&#39;m glad you asked because <br/>\nalthough I have been unschooling for probably 5 years or more, I still <br/>\nfeel like a newbie!  Ha!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my kids are both boys, ages 5 and 9.  We have been extremely <br/>\nlow-key these past years, and they spend most of their time playing.  <br/>\nAnd of course, we unschoolers know that playing is a kids&#39; work and <br/>\nthat&#39;s how they learn.  My kids love imaginary play right now -- they <br/>\nare always making up scenarios for their toys and saying stuff like <br/>\n&#39;this guy is invisible but he can still carry guns,&#39; or similar things.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s all in the abilities of the toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older boy also loves legos and will spend literally hours building <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am completely confident that unschooling is the way for us, although <br/>\nmy husband is not so certain from time to time.  He is quite frustrated <br/>\nthat Cyrus (9) is not reading right now, but the way I look at it, Cyrus <br/>\nactually does read some words and he is picking up more very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last few months I have decided to add a more or less &#39;structured&#39; <br/>\nactivity to our day and that is to add a designated hour in the middle <br/>\nof every day for reading aloud.  I plan to read aloud to the boys right <br/>\nafter lunch every day because until now, I have reserved bedtime for <br/>\nreading, and nowadays once I fall into bed and start reading I fall <br/>\nasleep within 5 minutes! lol!  I want them to have stories so I felt <br/>\nthat I HAD to add that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy philosophy is to basically take things one day at a time and see what <br/>\nturns up.  I joined this list recently also because I know there is so <br/>\nmuch wisdom and experience here and I want to learn from these people!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to have you here, Penny!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggie<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Penny Holder&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:learnathome@...\">learnathome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Website<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Is everyone on this list experienced?  No<br/>\n  newbies like me???? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, pretty much...:)<br/>\nActually, the list is full of people that are die-hard, pure, radical<br/>\nunschoolers. It matters not if your are new, it&#39;s more important that you<br/>\ncompletely embrace unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me know.   I joined to learn about unschooling and <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nbetter place to learn than with the most experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould everyone tell me how old their children are, how long you have been<br/>\nunschooling, and  what a typical day is like?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nPenny<br/>\nUsborne Books<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/J1915\">http://www.ubah.com/J1915</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12946,"nextTopicId":12956}}
