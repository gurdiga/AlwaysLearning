We&#39;ll all take turns being in the middle and hugging and kissing each other.<br/>\nWe continue to cuddle at various other times during the day.<br/>\nThere are also lots of fun hiding games we play in bed, hiding under the covers, pretending to hatch out of an egg, or being wrapped up like presents.<br/>\nWhen Logan is feeling tired, overwhelmed, or upset, he&#39;ll tell me we need to go lay in bed and cuddle, sometimes he&#39;ll nurse, sometimes not.<br/>\nThe day ends the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Logan went to pre-school right now like all of his friends, we&#39;d be missing hours of wonderful cuddling!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57322,"nextTopicId":50439}}
