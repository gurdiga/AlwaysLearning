If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; advocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>\n&gt; my six year old?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who says we&#39;re all equal - I didn&#39;t see that in my unschooling instruction <br/>\nbooklet &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nEqual is such a tricky word -- it is usually assumed by the user that <br/>\neverybody knows what they mean by it - but that is often not the case. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know, in this case, what it means to Dawn. A 6 yo and and adult teacher <br/>\nare equal in what ways? There are many ways they are clearly not equal, of <br/>\ncourse, and one of those would be physical size and another would be the <br/>\n&quot;authority&quot; typically vested in them by the rest of society. These may matter <br/>\nin some circumstances and not in others. If a 6 yo knows all about some topic <br/>\nand a 40 yo knows little about it, then they are once again not equal in terms<br/>\n of knowledge about that topic and in this example the 6 yo is more of an <br/>\nauthority. It happens all the time in unschooling circles - that kids are <br/>\nactually given recognition of such expertise that they have. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m pretty sure that Dawn didn&#39;t mean &quot;equal&quot; in any of these senses -- <br/>\nmaybe just in terms of being equally worthy human beings? Something more <br/>\nalong those lines?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were times when my kids were young that they themselves handled <br/>\nuncomfortable situations with adults/teachers/leaders/etc. and times that I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have let them handle it alone because I didn&#39;t think they understood <br/>\nwhat they were getting themselves into. I wouldn&#39;t let them handle it if I <br/>\nthought the adult would become physically or verbally abusive, for example. <br/>\nBut - that is parenting judgement - knowing the situation and our own kids <br/>\nand so on. I don&#39;t see it as an &quot;unschooling&quot; issue at all - unless someone <br/>\nwants to argue that unschooling means always leaving kids to deal with stuff <br/>\non their own based on the principle that kids are &quot;equal&quot; to adults. But I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever heard any unschoolers seriously argue that parents shouldn&#39;t act as <br/>\nresponsible parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] negotiating for kids","postDate":"1013375945","msgId":4596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhlLjIyYzM0YmIxLjI5OTgzZGM5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4594,"nextInTopic":4633,"prevInTime":4595,"nextInTime":4597,"topicId":4588,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/10/02 2:14:47 PM, freeform@juno.com writes: ...
