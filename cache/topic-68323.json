If there comes enough interest, I&#39;m willing to do something late enough at my house that it&#39;s waking hours there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the chats work by people typing in, and it&#39;s all happening at once, which is too quick for some people&#39;s tastes.  No one really needs to write anything, though.  You can read, maybe ask a question and read some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing online chats since 1995, on and off. :-)   <br/>\nSometimes I save transcripts and sometimes I don&#39;t.  Sometimes the transcripts are fun to read and sometimes they aren&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut being in a live chat is a different kind of experience, and I invite you to check it out if you want to.  It doesn&#39;t hurt anyone&#39;s feelings if you enter the room, find it&#39;s too fast, and leave.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just took two months off for being in Europe (and travelling nearly every Wednesday, as it happened).  Now I&#39;m back!<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the week of the conference in Florida ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/\">http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/</a> mid-October ) there will be a chat every Wednesday until Christmas.   The day after Christmas I&#39;ll be doing set up and ferrying speakers for a symposium here in Albuquerque ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/\">http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/</a> , another thing you might want to consider attending).<br/>\n<br/>\nInformation on the chats, and a way to subscribe to weekly reminders, is here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/\">http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m taking this week to discuss something current, but generally we&#39;re going through The Big Book of Unschooling and we&#39;re up to page 83, Music, for August 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68322,"nextTopicId":68300}}
