Then  <br/>\nyou asked and they didn&#39;t care that much so they did something nice  <br/>\nfor you and found themselves something else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is inertia in tv watching, as there is in lots of other things.  <br/>\nIt takes energy to make a change/transition to another activity.  <br/>\nAlso, they have to have another activity in mind, which sometimes  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t thinking of that while watching tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents shouldn&#39;t be trying to entice kids away from tv out of fear  <br/>\nthat kids are watching too much tv. But they shouldn&#39;t be afraid,  <br/>\neither, of helping kids figure out what they really want to be doing  <br/>\nwith their time, it isn&#39;t some kind of unschooling rule that parents  <br/>\ncan&#39;t help kids move on if they&#39;re sort of stuck on something. That  <br/>\nhappens - I&#39;ve seen my kids keep playing a game, for example, past  <br/>\nthe point of it being fun (at least for one of them). I&#39;ve seen them  <br/>\nstick with it when they are frustrated and starting to get angry at  <br/>\neach other - they&#39;ve needed some help from me to realize that it was  <br/>\ntime to think of something else to do. And, some kids are more  <br/>\npassive, have less initiative, or some have trouble initiating  <br/>\ntransitions - parents should be helping out with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has used this example - teachers pull down the shades in a  <br/>\nclassroom so kids will pay more attention to schoolwork and not be  <br/>\ndistracted by what is outside the windows. When a parent restricts/ <br/>\nlimits tv, that is like the teacher pulling down the shades - it is  <br/>\nlimiting kids&#39; options, not expanding them. So - we don&#39;t want to do  <br/>\nthat, as unschooling parents, we want to open up the world, not  <br/>\nrestrict it. But, that doesn&#39;t mean putting tv-watching in some kind  <br/>\nof special status and, figuratively speaking, pulling down the shades  <br/>\non the rest of the world so that tv seems the only option, either.  <br/>\nUnschooling parents will interact with tv-watching kids and be  <br/>\noffering other stuff to them - NOT out of fear or annoyance with the  <br/>\ntv, but in order to expand their world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you might say, &quot;When this show is over, do you want to make  <br/>\ncookies with me?&quot; (Knowing that a kid really likes to make cookies,  <br/>\nmaybe has mentioned wanting to make cookies.)&quot; Or, you might say, &quot;I  <br/>\nsaw a hummingbird outside this morning, want to come look for one  <br/>\nwith me?&quot;  OR you might strew some toys or building supplies or art  <br/>\nsupplies around where the kids are watching tv - mine often forgot  <br/>\nabout the tv when I pulled their big dollhouse out, with all its  <br/>\npieces, or when I put really great colored pencils and exciting  <br/>\ncoloring books out or pattern blocks or other things. After a while,  <br/>\nI&#39;d notice they weren&#39;t really watching tv anymore and ask, &quot;Hey, do  <br/>\nyou mind if I put some music on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all these kinds of approaches are world-expanding, rather  <br/>\nthan world-limiting, and they don&#39;t spring from fear about tv, but  <br/>\nout of a desire to provide a rich environment, with lots of fun  <br/>\noptions, for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the above approach is a whole lot better than mom complaining  <br/>\nthat the tv is annoying to her and asking the kids to stop watching.  <br/>\nI mean, I don&#39;t really think it is going to hurt them for that to  <br/>\nhappen on rare occasions. It is how you respond to tv on a regular  <br/>\nbasis that is really the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Because they&#39;re doing something nice for you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; True.

Sounds, to me, like  <br/>\nyou&#39;re likely still in reactive mode - still hurt by what school did  <br/>\nto you. I don&#39;t feel that even the most overtly educational programs  <br/>\non PBS are shoving anything down kids&#39; throats - not as long as there  <br/>\nis a power button on the tv &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it really great? I don&#39;t know. I liked our life before we got<br/>\n&gt; tv, but maybe she likes it more now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is she stopping you from doing the things you used to do? Is that  <br/>\nbecause she wants to watch certain shows? Then, yeah, that&#39;s because  <br/>\nshe likes watching those shows more than whatever else it is that you  <br/>\nwant her to be doing. So, her life is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people don&#39;t do stuff, though, because they think the kid  <br/>\nis happy watching tv -- so parents don&#39;t provide as great an  <br/>\nenvironment as they would have without tv. It isn&#39;t the tv&#39;s fault,  <br/>\nor the child&#39;s fault, but the parents who are not doing their best to  <br/>\noffer a rich and full and stimulating life to their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there could be some guilt on the parents part that they are not  <br/>\npaying enough attention to their child, not offering an interesting  <br/>\nenough life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, parents sometimes feel tv is coming between them and their  <br/>\nchild - the parent claims not to like tv, but clearly the child does.  <br/>\nThe parent ought to be supporting that interest and getting involved  <br/>\nand cuddling up and watching together and talking about it later and  <br/>\nbuilding on it -- you might be finding dress-ups that relate to a  <br/>\nfavorite show or character, you might find related books or games or  <br/>\ntoys, you might make foods that were on a tv show -- supporting a  <br/>\nchild&#39;s interests doesn&#39;t mean support everything except tv, but a  <br/>\nlot of times parents seem to have a very hands-off attitude about tv  <br/>\nas if it was something done by the child, in isolation. Then they  <br/>\nblame the tv for the child being isolated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it seems that PBS is shoving education down kids&#39; throats, what  <br/>\nabout science centers or museums? Do they feel the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems like a throwing the baby out with the bathwater kind of  <br/>\nresponse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t LEARNING that is problematic, it is the attempt to coerce  <br/>\nit. When people have choice, they LOVE to learn and don&#39;t develop the  <br/>\nkind of resistance to it that you seem to be experiencing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSesame Street, for example, is fun and enjoyable for lots of kids  <br/>\nbecause of the learning that it entails. Kids LOVE to learn when they  <br/>\naren&#39;t being forced, assigned, graded, tested, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it IS great! Wondrous. Wish you could see it through my  <br/>\nhusband&#39;s eyes - he didn&#39;t have any tv growing up - I mean, there  <br/>\nwere not ANY tv&#39;s where he lived, he didn&#39;t see one until he was at  <br/>\nleast 12 years old and then only little bitty black and whites. He  <br/>\nnever saw a color tv until he was in his 20&#39;s. HE knows how to  <br/>\nappreciate the wonder of a big color tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: TV/Videos Games in Public Places","postDate":"1189875558","msgId":30539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDNjM4NjA5LTVGRTAtNEQyMC1BRTFELUEyRTI2Njk4RTcxQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZjaDFzays4MzY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZjaDFzays4MzY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30538,"nextInTopic":30540,"prevInTime":30538,"nextInTime":30540,"topicId":30520,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-One reason I m not sending her to school is so that she doesn t have to have all these numbers and letters shoved down her throat.

(I was deschooling from my Waldorf influences.)  Then I<br/>\nlearned more about unschooling and gradually released control of my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s viewing and gaming habits.  After that, when we&#39;d go to one<br/>\nof these places, I appreciated that my children had something they<br/>\nenjoyed doing while waiting.  But secretly (dang that Waldorf!) I think<br/>\nI still wondered whether they would ever be content with doing these<br/>\nmundane things without constant distraction.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWell, just recently I took my boys to get their hair cut at one of those<br/>\nkids&#39; places with the games at each station.  When my 9 year old was<br/>\nasked which game he wanted to play while getting his hair cut, he said,<br/>\n&quot;None.  I don&#39;t want to play right now.&quot;  Judging from her reaction, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think the hairdresser had ever heard a boy turn down the<br/>\nopportunity to play video games.  During the haircut he engaged her in<br/>\nconversation, chatting about his new dog and how he wanted his hair cut.<br/>\nThen today, he had a dentist appointment.  They&#39;ve always had video<br/>\ngames in the waiting room, but they&#39;ve recently added some features to<br/>\nthe examine rooms as well.  There are now Gameboys at each chair and DVD<br/>\nscreens mounted on the ceiling that the kids can watch while laying flat<br/>\non their backs.  When offered the Gameboy, Connor declined.  Then when<br/>\nthe assistant lowered him on his back she switched on the DVD player<br/>\nwithout even asking.  When he saw it come on, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nwatch anything.  Can you turn that off, please?&quot;   Again, judging by the<br/>\nstaff&#39;s reaction, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve experienced that very often.<br/>\nSo my no-limit boy is indeed setting his own internal limits and<br/>\nsurprising a great many adults with his choices along the way!<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to all those who have walked this path ahead of me and helped me<br/>\ngain the confidence to just trust my kids,<br/>\nSunday<br/>\nMom to Connor (9) and Treyson (5)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31323,"nextTopicId":31340}}
