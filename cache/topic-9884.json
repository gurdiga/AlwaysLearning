I always want to know what is going on with my kids and <br/>\na good purveyor of information can be very useful.  Sometimes it can be <br/>\nannoying -- because the tattler&#39;s motives may not be of purely helpful <br/>\nintent.  Sometimes (or many times) they just wanna see someone get in <br/>\nTROUBLE. However, most of the time the information purveyor is simply <br/>\nproviding commentary while trying to figure it all out for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child care provider I&#39;ve had many different little personalities in <br/>\nmy care and supervision.  Any group of young children has a fascinating <br/>\nand fun dynamic.  I had one child who was a real worrier -- and a <br/>\nbig-time information purveyor.  At the same time I had another child who <br/>\nwas a big risk-taker and boundary-tester.  I specifically asked my <br/>\nlittle IP guy if he was willing to report  regularly on the doings of my <br/>\nlittle thrill-seeker.  Natch, I never let T-S get too far afield, but I <br/>\nfigured and extra set of eyes and ears, along with frequent detailed <br/>\nreports on his doings, couldn&#39;t hurt.  Eventually the thrill-seeker <br/>\ncalmed down and the spy-guy outgrew his constant need to report.         <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Alicia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;But speaking of &quot;ratting...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Holly is finding it hard to fathom that some parents punish or criticize kids for tattling.
