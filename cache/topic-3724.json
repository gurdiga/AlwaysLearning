My son <br/>\n(nearly 12) and husband are both early risers (husband up at 5:30 a.m., son <br/>\nshortly thereafter). My daughter (2) is a VERY late stayer-upper. I am a very <br/>\nlight sleeper. We have a very small (2-bedroom) house. I thought it was <br/>\nclever to colocate the early risers in the other bedroom, leaving the night <br/>\nowl with me, but despite this plan, I still end up waking up whenever my son <br/>\nand husband do (perhaps I am a closet early-riser?). And once awake, I&#39;m the <br/>\nsort who can&#39;t fall back asleep. Things weren&#39;t so bad until my daughter <br/>\nbegan eschewing her afternoon nap (when I could catch up on mine, too, as <br/>\nlong as I could completely darken the room and the groundskeeper for Sengen <br/>\ndidn&#39;t come to bang away in the garage [we live in a barn cottage that is <br/>\nover the garage for an old 19th-century estate]).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that may be important is that my daughter wants to be <br/>\nfull-on-engaged with someone when she is awake.
