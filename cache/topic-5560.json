He was so pleased with <br/>\nthe results that he was almost floating on air.

Well, he did a really thorough cleaning of one end <br/>\nof it anyway.  He&#39;s buying a computer with his own money, and has cleaned out <br/>\nthe area where he&#39;s going to put it.  Vacuumed, brought me stuff to give to <br/>\ncharity, got me to help him find a good place to put the big box of Ninja <br/>\nTurtle figures, traded his long phone cord for a shorter one (he&#39;s decided to <br/>\njust leave the computer plugged into the phone line and not have a telephone <br/>\nin there).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis one was NOT my idea.  I knew he had room for it without a big clean, <br/>\nbecause I had done some big cleaning before Christmas so he&#39;d have room for <br/>\nthe gamecube he didn&#39;t know he was getting.  His dad put in shelves, and I <br/>\norganized about half of his stuff (at his request, because he was not <br/>\nfathoming how it could be done).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for hours, yesterday, he was cleaning happily, merrily!
