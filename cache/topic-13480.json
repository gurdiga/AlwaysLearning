I just jumped into jeans and <br/>\nstumbled out.  He said &quot;Maybe you should walk around a bit to wake up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad he was up and ready and thinking about that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t usually sleep that late but I had a night of weird dreams, which <br/>\nisn&#39;t common for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I went to take down some posters about her friend&#39;s missing dog, <br/>\nwhich was found because of the posters!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got back, Marty was playing the Beatles, on the turntable.  A Hard <br/>\nDay&#39;s Night, and singing, and rearranging gaming stuff (I would say &quot;cleaning <br/>\nup,&quot; but I didn&#39;t actually go look, so maybe he was just making room for more <br/>\nplaying).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe came downstairs to get something and I told him that album he was <br/>\nlistening to was the British Hard Day&#39;s Night, not the American version.  I <br/>\nsaid it didn&#39;t matter much, but just in case he was ever on Jeopardy and they <br/>\nasked a question about whether a song was on A Hard Day&#39;s Night, he needed to <br/>\nknow there were more songs on the English version than the American.   He <br/>\nnodded and said &quot;Okay.&quot;  Just as though it had been important. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit later I heard him call out through the house, &quot;Holly!  Why don&#39;t <br/>\nyou come play me at Harry Potter?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow his friend Brett&#39;s here, and Sadie is on her way.  They&#39;re both <br/>\nunschoolers.  Ryan (grown, works at Active Imagination) just called.  Maybe <br/>\nhe&#39;s coming over too, I don&#39;t know.  Kirby&#39;s at work.  Jeremy&#39;s coming later. <br/>\n Then he and Sadie are going to Espanola (hometown of Sadie, and of me) to <br/>\nsee Godspell which is being put on by the little college uour checklist.  <br/>\nDriving through Santa Fe&#39;s not too hard if we just stay on St. Francis Drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s shaping up to be a happy and leisurely weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5379,"nextTopicId":13484}}
