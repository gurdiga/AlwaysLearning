That&#39;s something we saw when Ray was little - he was sooooooo social that it didn&#39;t seem right to keep him away from social situations... except that he had such a hard time he didn&#39;t learn anything positive and it was really hard on his self-esteem. It helped to be more considerate of his real capabilities - keep him home and socialize with him there and only take him out when an adult could focus on him and helping him negotiate the world and other people. Sometimes that meant not taking him grocery shopping (for instance) because I didn&#39;t have the energy to deal with Ray in a store - keeping him talking and busy so he wouldn&#39;t suddenly climb the displays or run the cart into someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s been true for Mo, too, although in different ways. She doesn&#39;t explode, she shuts down - turns into a statue, sort of. It has been more helpful to notice the kinds of situations which shut her down and manage them for her - steer her in a particular direction, or leave quickly, or (if the problem isn&#39;t social, but a need to make a choice) bring a book and sit down so she&#39;s not feeling pressured to perform and can go through her own process at her leisure. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s something in between &quot;robbing kids of opportunities to learn&quot; and &quot;setting them up to fail&quot; and it involves having a sense of those situations where your kid can&#39;t have a good experience and actively looking for ways to... not to prevent an explosion (or shut-down), but prevent the emotional factors which come right before the explosion.

He needed to see problems being solved much sooner in the course of things or he was likely to snap - and with social stuff that meant keeping things small. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor something like the situation with the nugget, it might have meant me checking all his food carefully to make sure it was within acceptable parameters... although realistically, food wasn&#39;t an issue for Ray, it is for Mo - and it was for my partner as a child; both his parents have stories about double-checking his food to make sure it was presented correctly lest he come completely unglued and be unable to eat. For Ray, the environment would have been the issue, so if he was getting stressed, we&#39;d go through the drive-through and not tried to eat inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is always doing this when<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s with his dad somewhere.

Does he try to talk him out of it? If he&#39;s saying &quot;oh, come on, it&#39;s no big deal, it&#39;s just a nugget&quot; that&#39;s not helping! It may even make things worse in the sense that Lukas feels compelled to make as big an issue as possible to try to convince his dad Just How Important This Is!

I have girls that have very big <br/>\nemotions and get overwhelmed rather easily. If home is a boring, crappy <br/>\nplace, then, yes, it will seem like being at home is being cooped up. Make <br/>\nhome a comfortable, sparkly, safe place. You can do that without lots of <br/>\nmoney. Rearrange the furniture, paint the walls if possible, use bedding to <br/>\nhang in doorways, see if there is a freecycle list in your area, or spread <br/>\nthe word among friends and family that you are on the look out for <br/>\nfree/cheep stuff that is interesting. And sometimes, you can get lots of <br/>\ncool free stuff online.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe commenting and screaming out in public could be a sign that he is <br/>\noverwhelmed. We will not eat inside a restaurant. We go through the drive <br/>\nthrough and eat in the car, at a park, or at home. If the order gets screwed <br/>\nup or if there is something wrong with the food, my husband or I can go in <br/>\nand deal with it in a peaceful manner. If we want fancier food, my husband <br/>\nwill pick it up and bring it home and we sit around the coffee table and <br/>\neat. If we go places, we try to plan it so that we are there at off times <br/>\nbecause I know that huge crowds in confined places will create problems. If <br/>\nsomebody talks to the girls, especially the ones that I know are likely to <br/>\nsay something inappropriate, I will step in immediately and run <br/>\ninterference. If they do say something inappropriate, I apologize to the <br/>\nperson that it was directed at and then get the kid out of the situation <br/>\nimmediately. One of my girls flipped somebody off when we were waiting in <br/>\nline at the check out one day. I apologized to the lady and then took my <br/>\ndaughter to the car immediately to get her out of that situation. My husband <br/>\nand I were together so I let him pay for everything. That is something else <br/>\nthat we do is try to go out as a family as often as possible so that one of <br/>\nus can escape with one or more kids if necessary and the other person can <br/>\ntie up loose ends, check out, or whatever.<br/>\nDon’t expect kids, especially those with big emotions to be able to express <br/>\nwhy they do things. I have one daughter that will cry for no apparent <br/>\nreason. Sometimes she will tell me what is on her mind and sometimes she <br/>\nwill shrug and say she doesn’t know. During those times, I try to insulate <br/>\nher and give her a safe space to have her emotions. If you live in a space <br/>\nwhere he can’t be loud or expressive, take him somewhere that he can run and <br/>\nscream and be loud whether it is a park or someplace else. Having to keep <br/>\nall of those big emotions inside at home must be rough and it sets up a <br/>\nsituation where he is walking around ready to explode. Look for some free <br/>\nactivities that would allow him to get really physical and aggressive. Maybe <br/>\nthe two of you could take up running or something. I know it is possible to <br/>\ndo stuff on a limited budget with no car. It may take some creativity but it <br/>\nis possible.<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":420468373,"authorName":"Lisa Celedon","from":"Lisa Celedon &lt;lisajceledon@...&gt;","profile":"lisajceledon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I need serious help","postDate":"1349540095","msgId":69281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5QUFEMTFGLURFQTMtNEJENC1CNTJGLUZDMkNBQjkxRjA5Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0b2JqOCtuZ2pjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs0b2JqOCtuZ2pjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69280,"nextInTopic":69284,"prevInTime":69280,"nextInTime":69282,"topicId":69240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-842987541\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He doesn&#39;t let up.

I think you are looking for someone to validate how you feel about it.  Therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough his response (yelling profanities) to the chicken nuggets was socially unacceptable, I think it&#39;s reasonable to be upset when the food you order shows up &quot;yucky.&quot; Just as there are standards of public behavior, there are standards of customer service. I myself am pretty particular about food, and can&#39;t stomach something that is *off* for me. I still feel so disappointed when paying for a meal (we don&#39;t eat out often), and what I get doesn&#39;t meet my expectations. As a child it felt devastating.<br/>\nHe needs help learning how to respond to such situations. The offending nugget could have been taken to the counter and asked to be replaced. Maybe seeing that solving the problem was as simple as that would help him not need to lose it next time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very wary of strangers and does not like when they speak directly to him- he often shouts in response &quot;stop talking to me!&quot; he&#39;s almost three, and though people are understanding that he is young, and recognize his discomfort, sometimes they are offended. In either case, I apologize, &quot;I&#39;m sorry he shouted at you,&quot; and if they are interested in continuing a friendly exchange (and my son doesn&#39;t show a sign of being uncomfortable that I am talking to them), I chat pleasantly with them. He may or may not get involved as well. If he is not comfortable with me talking to them, I follow up my apology with, &quot;I&#39;m not able to chat right now.&quot; I want to validate his discomfort and show a polite way out.  Some strangers are very disrespectful of children- touching his hair, for example- and I think a child (or anyone for that matter) needs some tools to distance themselves from an uncomfortable situation. Currently, for both our sons, that is yelling.  With help, that can change.  I realize that there has been a fair amount of yelling in my own household, so that has formerly been established as an appropriate means of communicating. Being polite to the people we meet is a way I can provide an example of social behavior in public to my own son.  As embarassing as it when my son yells at someone (or myself) in public, I don&#39;t avoid it for that reason.  In fact, that would be robbing him of an opportunity to learn how to appropriately respond to strangers in public- especially if he wants to be out.  If your son wants to go out, he should.  It&#39;s up to you to provide the opportunity to learn how to deal with these situations in public, you (or his father) are his guide.<br/>\nIf you respond to his rudeness with more rudeness or punishment, you&#39;re being hypocritical.  He probably sees that, and it may be contributing to his frustration.<br/>\nBeing polite to him, and taking his feelings seriously (such as when he is upset about a messed up nugget), and helping him find a solution (like replacing the nugget) is a better way to help him learn politeness and consideration for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are looking for ways to help yourself &quot;manage&quot; or &quot;deal with&quot; who your son is, instead of accepting who he is and seeking solutions to help him respond to his family and the world in socially acceptable ways.  I&#39;m not sure any advice anyone gives you will help until you learn to value who he is and what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 5, 2012, at 9:20 PM, &quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ronniegreek@...\">ronniegreek@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He doesn&#39;t let up.

That doesn&#39;t mean give him<br/>\n&gt; his way all the time regardless of the impact on others, or to give him<br/>\n&gt; control over what others in the household can or can&#39;t do.

You understand that he likes them closed, but you also like the sunshine coming into the house, and you&#39;d like to figure out a way to share that will make you both happy.   Have (calm) conversations about his preferences and yours, and your husband&#39;s, what you have in common, what is different, to understand and learn about one another.<br/>\nThat was the spirit behind the previous advice you were given, I&#39;m not sure if you gave it a try and found that it made no difference in his response (and you don&#39;t need to answer that). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when you&#39;re feeling in particular need of sunshine, have you thought of stepping outside? Invite him to take a walk with you?  Can you take a walk on your own if he doesn&#39;t want to accompany you?  If he is unhappy or unable to meet you halfway on these issues (for whatever reason), maybe you need some new ideas of how to meet your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that having your neighbor come and speak with him about how his yelling bothers her seemed to make a difference. That suggests to me that he&#39;s not incapable of taking other people&#39;s feelings into consideration.  Or maybe he doesn&#39;t want her to come back and talk to him again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does sound like everyone is unhappy in the situation, and that you need some outside help.  I would go the route Sandra recommended first.  Labels (such as OCD, or autism) may be less helpful than simply trying to understand who your son is, and the dynamics of what is happening in your family.  If you&#39;re in a position where you are unable to help him without a label, it  may be helpful then.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are worried that he may physically hurt himself, don&#39;t delay in getting help. <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 5, 2012, at 8:00 AM, &quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ronniegreek@...\">ronniegreek@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; okay your right but when we say to him </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":373387508,"authorName":"troubadour4me","from":"&quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;ronniegreek@...&gt;","profile":"troubadour4me","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: I need serious help","postDate":"1349449244","msgId":69259,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs0bXNtcys1cnM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFENjREOTQ2LUM1RTktNEY2Mi04MEU4LUY2NUY0MUJBRDI0N0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69258,"nextInTopic":69260,"prevInTime":69258,"nextInTime":69260,"topicId":69240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"okay your right but when we say to him Lukas you can have the curtains closed to such and such time or some days he wants them closed ALL the time...every day","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-519474026\">okay your right but when we say to him Lukas you can have the curtains closed to such and such time or some days he wants them closed ALL the time...every day and when we tell him we are going share so we all are happy....he pitches a fit!

He may have a need for some control, and is it possible for you to let him have that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The comment about the TV- I believe someone commented that your post sounded as if there was an assumption that your husband should have more right to the new, big tv, than your son, and he should have equal (not more or less) right to use it as anyone else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t recall anyone suggesting that you give full control of the house, or the tv, to your son.  At most, I think it was suggested that your son may learn compassion for others, and take others&#39; needs into consideration, but that he first had to trust that he was being shown compassion and having his needs taken seriously.  That doesn&#39;t mean give him his way all the time regardless of the impact on others, or to give him control over what others in the household can or can&#39;t do.  That isn&#39;t kind to anyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From what you&#39;ve written in both instances, it sounds like you are trying to appease him, to keep him from getting angry or exploding- and that you are not happy with the measures you&#39;re having to take to accomplish that.  I think it&#39;s one thing to accommodate his needs as much as you can because you want to be kind and considerate of him- it&#39;s another thing entirely to do it out of fear of handling his big, angry emotions.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lisa C<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Oct 4, 2012, at 2:26 PM, &quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;ronniegreek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes they did Sandra.

I don&#39;t know where you live, what state or country. But, here in Florida, you can do it how you like after knowing what he issues are. And you can get him some great help and new tools to manage his ways. He may always struggle with these compulsions if he is on the autism spectrum, which is what it sounds like to me. ( my son was initially diagnosed as being on the spectrum at age 2 but he has a speech disorder that has symptoms that present as ASD, so he was receiving occupational therapy which really really helped in his younger years of 2-3). We encountered many ASD kids and I have several friends who have ASD kids who sound very much like your son. And they are wonderful kids! Therapy helps them to learn to handle the world that they are having trouble handling. They and you,need to learn how to make life enjoyable and how to live this new life. And to better understand him and how his brain works. Through therapy, you and he will learn that. I&#39;m betting that, as my friend&#39;s kids learned, once you learn how he sees the world and how to help him through that and how to help yourself through that, you all will gain much insight and hope as a family. It won&#39;t be a magic cure but receiving therapy, we used the DIR/ Floortime method my Dr. Greenspan- we were able to help our family so much with this model. I would highly recommend the book Engaging Autism or books on sensory processing disorder, and professional therapy to have a better idea of what is going on with him. If he had a physical disease that was hindering or hurting his life, I know you would get him medical treatment ASAP, his mental health is JUST as important to make him feel safe, happy, healthy and hopeful. <br/>\nI wish the best for you and these are only my thoughts and observations from reading your posts. I highly highly recommend an evaluation by a developmental/ neurological pediatrician. Here in the states, that is free. And therapy here can be free as well. For us, the Floortime method changed our lives and opened our son up and he is a talking machine now! His articulation is still difficult but boy oh boy has he grown in his speech and language! He can now talk and share his thoughts, communicate like a little child. It&#39;s wonderful. And some of that has come through therapy and much of that has come from us and him! You can have control over his mental health and not have the &quot;system&quot; have ultimate say because YOU have the power to stop it if you like. Don&#39;t allow that fear to stop you all from enjoying a joyful and manageable life. He needs that. He needs understanding and joy.

Even if you get a car, there is <br/>\na possibility that your son may not want to get out as much as you. Four or <br/>\nfive years ago, I was in your shoes. I was so convinced that having a car <br/>\nwould fix all of my problems. When we got another car, the girls didn’t want <br/>\nto go out so I felt like I was right back where I started. It was a <br/>\nmiserable way to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to today, I have a car but we rarely go out because my girls <br/>\nget easily overwhelmed (so do I for that matter) by large crowds. I have <br/>\nfound ways to bring the world to us. I try to have lots of options for <br/>\nthings to do at home. I invite my nieces and nephews to come over. My mom <br/>\nstops by periodically to hang out with us. I spend lots of time sitting on <br/>\nthe porch watching the kids play. I chat with the neighbor whenever I see <br/>\nher out. I write on my blog. I have picked up an instrument. I participate <br/>\nin online discussions. When I get to feeling trapped, I ask my husband to <br/>\nhang out with the girls and I go off by myself for a couple of hours. I call <br/>\nmy friends and family. There are lots of ways to open up the world. For me, <br/>\nonce I opened up my world, it became a lot easier to NOT get into power <br/>\nstruggles with the girls. A lot of the power struggles that I had with the <br/>\ngirls many years ago stemmed directly from my feelings of feeling trapped <br/>\nand out of control. We were butting heads because we were all trying to find <br/>\na way to feel like we had some control. We were in direct competition with <br/>\neach other. Now I see staying home as a choice that brings peace to the <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven’t seen the link to Sandra’s page on control posted yet: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/control\">http://sandradodd.com/control</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I need serious help","postDate":"1349438560","msgId":69254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDMTA5MzBCLUMxMDUtNEM3Ni1CRDYzLUU0RkFCQzkxNUQzREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0bHIyNisyY3ZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs0bHIyNisyY3ZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69253,"nextInTopic":69257,"prevInTime":69253,"nextInTime":69255,"topicId":69240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not to long ago. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember that conversation, but only on the Always Unschooled list because I was not on this list at the time.  If I remember correctly, someone pointed out that based on your email it sounded as if you were insisting on control as well (he needs the curtains closed, you need them open, etc.) and that to your son, you probably appear as the one who was controlling, and that his behavior may be a result from feeling that his needs are not respected or taken seriously (based on the tone of your post).  There were suggested ways to accommodate his needs (like sunglasses), and I think mostly the responses were geared toward having you reflect on what your needs really are, and how can you and your son work together to meet each other&#39;s needs.  He may have a need for some control, and is it possible for you to let him have that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comment about the TV- I believe someone commented that your post sounded as if there was an assumption that your husband should have more right to the new, big tv, than your son, and he should have equal (not more or less) right to use it as anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall anyone suggesting that you give full control of the house, or the tv, to your son.  At most, I think it was suggested that your son may learn compassion for others, and take others&#39; needs into consideration, but that he first had to trust that he was being shown compassion and having his needs taken seriously.  That doesn&#39;t mean give him his way all the time regardless of the impact on others, or to give him control over what others in the household can or can&#39;t do.  That isn&#39;t kind to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what you&#39;ve written in both instances, it sounds like you are trying to appease him, to keep him from getting angry or exploding- and that you are not happy with the measures you&#39;re having to take to accomplish that.  I think it&#39;s one thing to accommodate his needs as much as you can because you want to be kind and considerate of him- it&#39;s another thing entirely to do it out of fear of handling his big, angry emotions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 4, 2012, at 2:26 PM, &quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ronniegreek@...\">ronniegreek@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yes they did Sandra.

My sister didn&#39;t have them - I did - and I was pretty sure it was<br/>\nunfair, unjust, and probably evidence of a curse (seriously, I thought I was<br/>\ncursed, yep :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, my parents helped me discover lots of things about freckles that<br/>\nhelped me get over my dislike of them, such as. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*Often, as you get older, freckles fade out and are less noticeable, even<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re still there.  But that takes until you&#39;re an adult, usually, if<br/>\nit&#39;s going to happen.  And it doesn&#39;t happen with everyone.  Some people get<br/>\nmore freckles as they age, not less.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*People with freckles tend to get less pimples/acne.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s<br/>\ncurrent wisdom or if that has been disproven (might be worth Googling), but<br/>\nI had older cousins with terrible acne and the idea that my freckles could<br/>\nkeep my skin from looking like theirs made me slightly happier :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*Elderly people in my own family who were freckled when they were younger<br/>\nwere not very wrinkly when they were older.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But when<br/>\nI was little, the idea of less wrinkles, like less acne, seemed a lovely<br/>\nidea to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*Lots of people who have freckles don&#39;t like them, and there are laser<br/>\ntreatments and bleach treatments and other such &quot;remedies&quot; for people who<br/>\nreally can&#39;t live with being freckled.

Ask him to tell you what he doesn&#39;t like about them - why do they bother him? His answer may not make sense to you, but don&#39;t try and talk him out of his feelings. Commiserate. Maybe talk about something you don&#39;t like about yourself and how you&#39;ve learned to live with it - don&#39;t you have chronic pain? maybe talk about that, as a way of sharing how other people also have things they don&#39;t like about their bodies but can&#39;t change. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":373387508,"authorName":"troubadour4me","from":"&quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;ronniegreek@...&gt;","profile":"troubadour4me","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"I need serious help","postDate":"1349370092","msgId":69240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs0a2ZkYys3c3RrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69241,"prevInTime":69239,"nextInTime":69241,"topicId":69240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Awhile back i posted about my son Lukas (11yo. tomorrow ) has been acting on ocd type behaviours.

He wanted the curtains closed, the couch untouched and the remotes lined up on a table in the living room. plus, the new t.v. can only be used by him. I got advice to let him have that control. okay...we did and i still have problems but a more important one is going on with him and i wanted to discuss it here before i take it further. He hates his freckles! He talks about them all day. He stratches (sp) at them. we got him concealer. He puts in on but soon after screams it doesn&#39;t work. We got him foundation too.<br/>\n He asks when they will go away. I told him everything i could think of...they are beautiful...they will go away. Nothing comforts him.
