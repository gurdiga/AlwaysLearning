Living Joyfully with Children by Win and Bill Sweet.  Easy <br/>\nreadm but packed full of wisdom  Written by grandparents, not PhD&#39;s. <br/>\n(Well, they may be PhD&#39;s in something, but they&#39;re not using it as <br/>\nexpertise for the book.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat book replaced my former favorite, which was &quot;How to talk so <br/>\nkids will listen...&quot;  which is still available.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing for a step-dad to remember is that everything he <br/>\ndoes might be taken wrong, until he really, really gains the child&#39;s <br/>\ntrust, and he&#39;s proven that he&#39;s reasonable and approachable.  This <br/>\ntakes years, in most cases  He should never discipline your son, or <br/>\ncomplain in front of your son that you don&#39;t discipline him.  When <br/>\nmy husband and I were first married, he tried to make my middle son <br/>\nsit and eat his whole dinner.  Since Jon didn&#39;t seem too distressed, <br/>\nI let it go (I wasn&#39;t an unschooler then, either). As soon as my dh <br/>\nsaw fit to let him up from the table, Jon threw up in the trash <br/>\ncan.  My husband to this day learns from that example, even though <br/>\nthat was over 16 years ago and Jon is 21.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband might also consider you might be right when you say <br/>\nit&#39;s different when it&#39;s your own.  It would be nice if step-dads <br/>\nand moms could actually feel for their stepchildren the way they do <br/>\nabout their own children.  But if they don&#39;t have any biological <br/>\nchildren, they probably can&#39;t recognize the depth of feeling.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot something you can explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, get those books.  They&#39;ll be quite helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren, in for a peek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Christy Putnam&quot; <br/>\n&lt;personal_balance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dh has taken a step towards figuring out this whole step-dad <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thing (been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; together 3 years) and trying to understand unschooling (we just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>started this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; year) checked out some books at the library.
