Sometimes I feel like that, like, if it weren&#39;t for this dang internet (and all the information I feel I must gobble up) I&#39;d be doing things the old fashioned way. You know, reading, physically learning, contemplating, writing, doing. Not clicking, clicking, searching, clicking, reading, clicking, searching, thinking, clicking, typing...you get the idea. But then I realized I&#39;m reading, reading, reading...and I just can&#39;t get enough! But then again, is that a bad thing??<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Even if that were true, which I doubt, because the human brain is pretty good at adapting, why would it be a bad thing to rely on many forms of information gathering over plain text?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I totally get.  The human brain is SO adaptable. And I find it intriguing that these &quot;experts&quot; still stick to these &quot;old fashioned&quot; ideas when it comes to learning to read or reading in general. It&#39;s kinda like that whole &quot;lets burn the Harry Potter Books&quot; idea that some people/groups have--they completely miss the point that kids/people are reading because they discovered a passion for it and thus will do it, and if we burn it/make it unavailable then a remarkable number of people will miss that experience of reading for the simple passion of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaryann Wolf said:<br/>\n&quot;Each young reader has to fashion an entirely new &quot;reading circuit&quot; afresh every time. There is no one neat circuit just waiting to unfold. This means that the circuit can become more or less developed depending on the particulars of the learner: e.g., instruction, culture, motivation, educational opportunity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I thought, was the the gem. Like Robyn said, these are not a problem for the unschooler--just for those that think that learning needs to happen on a timescale. I would assume (although I might be wrong) that Wolf thinks learning should be left to schools, but her statement applies equally to kids stuck there...they may or may not learn to read well as a result of their environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been immersed in a 3-day intensive doula training workshop, and it has been made clear that this time schedule problem starts even before the baby is born. If one births in the hospital, the laboring woman is put on a time-schedule of how her labor is supposed to progress. Interestingly, I think this idea of timescale with regards to labor, to learning, to life, is an idea that&#39;s had its day...time to discard, move on, and live REAL life.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a side note (totally off topic), I&#39;m finding that all the amazing things I&#39;ve been reading here and on Sandra&#39;s site are relevant to helping women have safe, natural births.

We learn to do so by an extraordinarily <br/>\ningenuous ability to rearrange our &quot;original parts&quot; - like language and <br/>\nvision, both of which have genetic programs that unfold in fairly orderly <br/>\nfashion within any nurturant environment. Reading isn&#39;t like that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for unschoolers where reading is exactly like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Each young reader has to fashion an entirely new &quot;reading circuit&quot; afresh <br/>\nevery time. There is no one neat circuit just waiting to unfold. This means <br/>\nthat the circuit can become more or less developed depending on the <br/>\nparticulars of the learner: e.g., instruction, culture, motivation, <br/>\neducational opportunity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLook what she puts first in the series of variables - &quot;instruction&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo from this we can conclude that her concept of what reading is and how <br/>\nlearning it works is tremendously traditional and conservative. So maybe her <br/>\napproach to new technologies that are part of the new text rich environment <br/>\nis traditional and conservative too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the comments from the next guy - e-book and vooks are not the only <br/>\nchoices and books aren&#39;t going anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was interested in the comments by your cousin, Sandra Aamodt, based on <br/>\nobservations of the behavior of people reading different sources. Her book <br/>\nsounds intriguing also (I constantly lose stuff in my house). However some <br/>\nof the behaviors of adults that she cites as possibly being problematic, <br/>\nespecially in a working situation, are emphatically not problems for <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter if unschooling kids are mercurial in their activities. <br/>\nIt&#39;s OK for them to be going down a rabbit hole of connections. They aren&#39;t <br/>\nbeing judged on their ability to stick to a task as they might be in school <br/>\n(plus observation shows that they will when it&#39;s important to them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
