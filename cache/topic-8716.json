There&#39;s nothing stopping anyone doing an OU <br/>\ndegree part time while working to earn the money to pay for it. In <br/>\nfact, I think that ina way its more useful because the student will <br/>\nhave work expereinece too.<br/>\nThe downside (in the UK at least) is that OU degrees are <br/>\nexpensive. We don&#39;t pay tuition for our degrees. They are free to <br/>\nUK residents. Poorer students get a government grant while richer <br/>\nones borrow the money from the Student Loans Company with no <br/>\ninterest.<br/>\nI enjoyed my 3 years at university. There was a lot of drinking <br/>\ninvloved ( another UK thing - you can drink at 18. Perfect timing for <br/>\nentering university). It&#39;s fun.<br/>\nI still think that any self-motivated person can go from zero <br/>\nknowledge to an A level in the required 2 years. I&#39;ve seen HE <br/>\nchildren do that. One took A level maths in 9 months having never <br/>\nlooked at a math textbook becasue it was important to the CHILD.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house seems to be a microcosm of the outside world. Me, a <br/>\nHE mum who is convinced unschooling in the way to go, my <br/>\nhusband, who is horrified at the lack of lessons and brings up all <br/>\nthose tired old arguments that we are often faced with and our <br/>\nchildren who are stuck in the middle.<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried telling my husband that even if it all goes horribly wrong <br/>\nthey can always go to college (high school for anyone over 16) and <br/>\ndo traditional A levels. They can go at any age. University doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be done at 18. I went at 20 myself. A levels are free up to <br/>\nthe age of 19. I told him I will personally go out to work to pay for <br/>\nthem if the kids are older than that and want them :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing my in-laws is a nightmare. FIL is university Professor who <br/>\nlooks down on anyone without a degree (UK degrees are more <br/>\nelitist than the ones here. Fewer people go as the entry <br/>\nrequirements for university are stricter). He refers to them as <br/>\n&#39;plebs&#39;. MIL teaches physics at A level and thinks Science is some <br/>\nkind of higher calling. It&#39;s an obsession with her.<br/>\nYou can now see where DH gets these attitudes from. He went to <br/>\na private school and excelled academically (you can see why can&#39;t <br/>\nya!), went to a prestigious university then got a PhD in 2 years. <br/>\nAnd now he&#39;s married to me. Purple haired hippy who&#39;d rather take <br/>\nthe kids hiking and socialise with fellow humans. He spends all <br/>\nday with DoD scientists and then he comes home to chaos. Dirty <br/>\ndishes in the sink, laundry everywhere and the kids and me have <br/>\nlearned to build a lego fort :-)<br/>\nPoor man.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley who rambled on more than she planned<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChaos, panic and disorder - my work is done here.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] A levels & uni","postDate":"1030113604","msgId":8727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODIzMTQ0MDQ5LlZGTkIxNzYzNi5vdXQwMTAudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAbWFya3Njb21wdXRlcj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwODIzMTIwMTM2LjQxNjgucW1haWxAd2ViMTQzMDQubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2LjJjNzNlNzg0LjJhOTc3NzliQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":8720,"nextInTopic":8730,"prevInTime":8726,"nextInTime":8728,"topicId":8716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
