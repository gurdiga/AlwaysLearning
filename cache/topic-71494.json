Recently, at a Girl Scout sleepover, there were some teenagers hanging out in the far end of the parking lot where the activity was held. The other parents were all upset about this and started brainstorming to call the police or the owners of the building to address the teens and tell them to leave. <br/>\nI simply went outside, talked to the teens ( who were very nice and assured me they were just taking a walk and stopped to talk), and just asked that they not use profanity ( which they weren&#39;t ) or address the girls if they came outside because it made them nervous. They agreed, no problem at all.<br/>\nI returned to the other parents who had decided they would have the police remove the them and told them to not worry about it. I had talked to the teens, and they were happy to comply. I also reminded them that their sweet little girls would also some day be teenagers, and they would want others to treat them as people too, not speak to them through police or other means.<br/>\nSadie Bugni<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Boys hitting in group settings","postDate":"1368739744","msgId":71499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGNTVENzUxLTgxRDAtNDExNy1CRUUzLTExNTIzMzVBNkJDMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjg3MzUyNzUuMjIxNDcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGttdTFuOStsdGQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM2ODczNTI3NS4yMjE0Ny5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIwOTA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71498,"nextInTopic":71500,"prevInTime":71498,"nextInTime":71500,"topicId":71494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Does this group have a correlating yahoo group or facebook group?

That would probably help enormously. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter needed to stay away from kids who were more fragile than she was for a couple years - some of that I did for her, and stayed away from big groups where there were likely to be little kids and dainty kids. There were a few families I lost touch with because their kids were dainty - Mo couldn&#39;t play with them without hurting them. She needed sturdy, boisterous kids who could play hard. That&#39;s not much of a help if it&#39;s not your child who&#39;s hurting others, unless your kid is sturdy and would enjoy playing with this other child - then you could invite them for one-on-one playdates. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It is to the point where parents whose children have been the victims are starting to go home early or not join us.

We dont really get into educaional or parenting philosophies a lot but mostly get together for activities, sports and free play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group intitially was mainly girls and mainly children who have never been to school.  In the past year we have had several families join us who have removed their children from schools and the group is now about half boys and half girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had several incidents and they seem to be escalating of physical violence-hitting mostly but serious punches being thrown.  The ages of the boys are 7 and 8.  Sometimes the girls get hurt and sometimes it is the boys.  So far my girls haven&#39;t been the victims and I don&#39;t have any boys so I have tried to stay out of it.  The response of the people involved seems to be to talk about the situation at length with the offenders and request an apology for the victim.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that it keeps happening and in particular one child (who has never been to school) is often the offender.  It is to the point where parents whose children have been the victims are starting to go home early or not join us.  I find myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable with the persistence of the problem.  I think the offenders should have more of a consequence and also be monitored more closely preferably by their parents.   Basically I don&#39;t think physical violence is acceptable but don&#39;t know how to express that to other parents or prevent it happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does anyone have any experience with situations like this?
