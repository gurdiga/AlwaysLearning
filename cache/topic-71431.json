Jay, our four year old, is currently calling himself &#39;Chef&#39; and is enjoying cooking meals and cakes. He wanted to watch a cooking programme so I was looking through the On Demand section on TiVo for something he&#39;d like: something that he could replicate, with not too much straying off topic. Ben (my husband) asked why I didn&#39;t just put &#39;I Can Cook&#39; on, which is a children&#39;s cooking programme where they get a group of children, and get them to cook a recipe by doing things like telling them they&#39;re &#39;tickling&#39; the flour and butter (when they&#39;re actually needing to mix it).<br/>\nI said the difference was that I Can Cook is made with the objective of making the process apparently childlike in order to get children to cook, whereas we have a son who wants to cook and wants to watch cooking and we can then support that in a way that he will enjoy. In the first instance, the idea of a child cooking is the priority, in the second, our child is the priority and he currently wants to cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nTam<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8 May 2013, at 17:35, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; A good indicator of your brain shifting gears from a mindset of teaching kids to helping kids explore is feeling a wrongness in how conventional parenting advice is worded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In today&#39;s New York Times is the subtitle to an article about a cooking magazine, ChopChop, for parents and kids to create more healthful dishes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; “The wisdom, and pleasure, of getting children interested in cooking early on.”<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and in the article:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;...
