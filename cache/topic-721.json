Is a woman or girl who likes to skateboard, play sports, hates dresses, doesn&#39;t wear make-up, doesn&#39;t want children, hates shopping malls etc., displaying male behaviors. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m just suggesting that we are all so immersed in our culture and have inevitably been brainwashed over the years in so many ways, really every way, and that we should always be vigilant to expose our prejudices and continually reevaluate and examine our world views. We are all, on this list, very diligent when it comes to education and critical analysis of schools and curriculum models and we need to apply this vigilance to all aspects of our lives including sexual stereotyping and gender identification especially as it applies to the perpetuation or bigotry.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Always learning,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Everybody wants to be admired, respected, and accepted and being gay or lesbian ultimately means being marginalized and disrespected by a significant portion of our society.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my closest friend left her husband the doctor for Mary-Ann, the magnificent basketball playing physical education instructor, she saw her social status plummet. People she had known for years passed her in the street shooting her a stern glance and turning the other way. Many of her lesbian and gay friends remain in the proverbial closet trying to maintain their dignity. This includes a principle of a Catholic school and the coach of a national basketball team. The support of friends and loved ones is great but unfortunately this does not change the reality of the general public attitude. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoys are especially harsh in this regard! Being called gay is the #1 cut up in the school yard today.

Kathleen, in good-matured-Mom <br/>\nteasing, asked if she&#39;d LIKED the boy. Em shrugged. THEN she asked if she&#39;d <br/>\nLIKED the girl, and Em blushed and smiled. I thought that was great...in the <br/>\ncourse of natural Mom-banter she&#39;d given Em the mesage it was okay WHOEVER <br/>\nshe liked. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily thought about homeschooling last year but decided to stick with school, <br/>\n partly because she&#39;d helped to found the Gay/Straight Alliance at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more story: Other friends have a son named Gabe, and the whole family was <br/>\nwaiting from mid-adolescence for Gabe to come out...It was SO obvious! So, <br/>\nthe parents, grandparents and siblings were all anxious, because they wanted <br/>\nto join PFLAG!  He finally got around to coming out when he was 23.
