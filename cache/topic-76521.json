href=\"http://sandradodd.com/limits/listening\">http://sandradodd.com/limits/listening</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s from a discussion in which a mom wanted to keep a child from listening to audiobooks so much.  <br/>\nIt’s not so much about what a child would be doing, but why a parent would want to stop him.  Learning doesn’t always show.<br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the side, the mom who had recommneded limiting video games to two hours a day, the same mom who had removed access to games for months (more than once, perhaps) wrote this:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My son listens to audiobooks ALL the time...do you think it&#39;s ok for children to barely go out and spend each day on computer games then?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elipsis was in the original.  I didn’t leave anything out.<br/>\nAnd, a reminder that this is prior to any understanding of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a question is asked in so defensive a way, in such a leading way, the mom should first relax.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/breathing\">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>\nThe ideas there will do anyone good.  Me, twice yesterday—once when I was seeing that my projects were piling up faster than I could complete them even if I stopped eating and sleeping, and once when I DID try to sleep and was having a hard time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think, of the question above, is that video games are more stimulating and are likely to produce more learning and joy than the best of audiobooks.   If it’s okay to listen to audiobooks all the time, but NOT okay to play video games for more than two hours, this shows fear and prejudice (and lack of knowledge) on the part of the mom.  Deschooling could change everything for her (and I’ve already sent links to some good information on the side, for deschooling and moving into unschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf audiobooks are being listened to outside, then maybe this mom’s insistence that every person must be outside every day or health is lost could be achieved in a two-for-one way.  But some people live where it’s way too hot to be outside much every day.  Some are in winter where it’s too cold.  Some are in a dangerous urban area, and outside isn’t a daily thing.  Some have houses with big sunny windows, screened porches, patios.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples are better than rules.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is better than control.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/control\">http://sandradodd.com/control</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne person cannot “balance” another person’s life.

The list discussion focuses on what helps and hinders learning and relationships.<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">Everyone who posts -- whether a question or a reply -- should want to see their ideas analyzed under an unschooling&nbsp;light.<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">The list thrives on unschooling questions and discussion! :-) But it&#39;s also perfectly okay to sit back and follow the&nbsp;discussion. (All new members are encouraged to do just that for awhile to get a feel for the list.)<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">Many find the analysis helps them clear out hidden baggage, think more clearly and become the radical unschooling&nbsp;parents they want to be. Some find it uncomfortable.<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">If you’re new to the idea of radical unschooling, there is some great information at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/beginning\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">http://sandradodd.com/beginning</a>&nbsp;Especially helpful is Pam Laricchia&#39;s introductory email series that&#39;s linked there.<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614510522\">If Always Learning sounds like a list you&#39;d like to try reply &quot;Yes&quot;.

It was so different to attachment parent and unschool one person for 5 years: I was so available to dive in whatever project with him at any given time and focus 100%. With a similar situation to yours ages-wise (a 7 1/2 year old and a 2 1/2 year old), I’m realizing its a whole other reality. It can be frustrating at times for my son for us to constantly be interrupted by his sister (who’ve very active and talks a lot) when he wants to do something with me. Often when we read a book she talks non-stop, describing what she sees on the images - which he finds awfully sweet most of the time, but sometimes it does really prevent him from hearing the story, so we try to ask her to listen with us or we try to find something else for her to do, but 3 minutes later she comes back and interrupts again. Earlier he wanted to play cop and robber with me in the street, but we ended up not really doing it b/c she doesn’t run fast enough to be either cop or robber and she would step down the sidewalk with cars coming - he was very different at her age and never stepped down a sidewalk but with her we need to keep our eyes on her as she just runs anywhere. I tried to run with her in a carrier but she is really really heavy now and I couldn’t really run. I tried the stroller but she didn’t want to sit in it :) I ended up running at the same rhythm as her which he didn’t enjoy b/c of course he could catch us right away when we were robbers and we never caught him when we were cops. :) So we decided to wait for daddy to be done with work by which time it was raining :)</span><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">I told him we can look at Sandra’s page with suggestions for little ones, and choose some things to keep her really busy when we start a game or a project - though I realize that with her personality most things she’ll enjoy doing WITH US and not on her own for more than a few minutes.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">Clara</div></div><div><br></div></font><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><br></font><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":522719163,"authorName":"","from":"sukaynalabboun@...","profile":"sukaynalabboun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Finding balance between gaming and other activities","postDate":"1455730124","msgId":76753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQyQzI3QTM1LUMzODAtNDkyQS04OEI2LTVEMzM4NTBGQzU4Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG5hMWw1dCsxZWFqaWQ5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":76542,"nextInTopic":76755,"prevInTime":76751,"nextInTime":76754,"topicId":76521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He&#39;s 15 and says that he hopes to become a planetary scientist, so he aspires to go to college. At this point, however, he has been completely involved in gaming (actually, this has been his main activity for about 4 years now). I&#39;ve discussed with him that he&#39;s going to need certain skills for college, but he hasn&#39;t shown much motivation for &nbsp;preparing himself in this way. Another issue we have is eating. He eats very little because he won&#39;t stop his games long enough to eat a decent meal. I&#39;ve tried keeping the house stocked with his favorite foods, and I will take the food to him while he&#39;s playing, but more often than not I end up throwing it away uneaten. Last year he was diagnosed with constitutional delay- at 15, he is 4&#39;8 and 65 lbs. He has never been a big eater, and I fear his preoccupation with gaming is making it worse. I am desperate for advice- especially on the eating issue!

Even just for fun without uploading them, Abby went through a big stage of doing that for a while.  <br /><br />If he&#39;s as happy as he seems staying home and exploring all his games and YouTube, I think he&#39;s doing wonderfully.  Abby sometimes has days where she mostly watches YouTube and plays Minecraft, but she tends to be miserable and cranky by the end of the day and really perks up with social interaction and doing something physical with me.  She&#39;s a big extrovert though, so quite different. <br /><br\n />As he gets older, maybe your son will enjoy getting together with other kids to game, or move further into gaming with others online.  Does his dad play his favourite games with him?  That might be a good way for them to connect.  As for not wanting to go out, can he bring his games with him?  Then he could come and go a bit more.  </div></td></tr></table></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":352743366,"authorName":"Tori Bart","from":"Tori Bart &lt;vic.skingsley@...&gt;","profile":"vicskibart","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Finding balance between gaming and other activities","postDate":"1452105434","msgId":76529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTzBjbjBiVTdOZnIyMzhoOUR5RjRUMDBTYXh1Z0ZrekNaek1jMnU1bTh2cHc1K0tZZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzUxM0I5LTNGOUItNEE5NS1BOEU0LTdGNUMyNjRCMkU0OEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG42ZmkxMytxN29yZWhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MDEzNTEzQjktM0Y5Qi00QTk1LUE4RTQtN0Y1QzI2NEIyRTQ4QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76528,"nextInTopic":76530,"prevInTime":76528,"nextInTime":76530,"topicId":76521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My nine year old daughter is also in this home-phase with everything that is roblox and minecraft.

She has learnt to type and learnt about servers and mods and computer stuff. She watches her favourite Youtubers and is learning heaps from them. We have created her own YouTube channel and we record videos together. She has made friends on the homeschooling server and interacts with them and others on the gaming servers. She plays minecraft story mode which is different still! We have minecraft Lego we play. I find other kids who like minecraft and tee them up for minecraft play dates. I buy her minecraft books that she can&#39;t put down!

My son \nis 7 and went to school for 3/4 of the year before deciding to stay \nhome. Although my son is happier at home I feel like we are not fully \ntapping into the joyful side of unschooling. <br><br>He is heavily into \ngaming and we&#39;re supporting that interest - we bought a new gaming \nlaptop a few months ago and heaps of new games in the last Steam sale. \nWe&#39;ve also progressed onto more mature games including finally allowing \nhim to play GTA 5. My son really enjoys playing and watching gamers on \nYouTube. We&#39;ve also connected with a few other unschoolers online. I \nwatch and play with him as much as possible although it&#39;s hard to find \nthe time because my 14 month old is very active and if we&#39;re sitting in \nfront of the laptop he wants to touch everything in range. If I&#39;m not \nwith him I&#39;m usually close by. <br><br></div>Although it&#39;s not always easy to see what he is learning I&#39;m confident that he is learning. <br><br></div>The\n issue we have is that he is not very physically active and apart from \nvisiting his friends he rarely wants to go out and do anything. He never\n has been a very active child to be fair but it really worries my DH who\n thinks it&#39;s unhealthy for him to be in front of the computer all day. <br><br></div>So\n I try to introduce other things but generally it&#39;s not met with much \nenthusiasm. A trip out of the house can be spoiled by moaning and \ncontinuously asking to go home even with incentives like ice cream and \nburgers. I invite him to do activities in the backyard and he&#39;s not \ninterested. He has few interests outside of gaming. He doesn&#39;t want to \nuse our pool, he doesn&#39;t like sports, doesn&#39;t want to go the beach, \ndoesn&#39;t want to read stories. Says he likes drawing but never uses the \nmaterials I leave out for him. <br><div><br>My DH has not read much \nabout unschooling so it&#39;s hard for him to fully accept the amount of \ngaming. So he criticises and then my son - who has quite a prickly \ncharacter anyway - responds badly. He also thinks that DS should be \nspending more time with kids his age at school. I think this is partly \nsome resentment that he has to go to work everyday while DS gets to do \nwhatever he likes at home. <br><br></div><div>I really want to respect \nhis right to choose what he does without it creating disharmony in our \nfamily as opposed to the peaceful joy I read about here. I wish he was a\n bit more rounded in his choice of activities. It&#39;s hard to reassure his\n dad that he is learning when I&#39;m still in leap of faith mode. I set up a\n private FB page for his dad so I could post pics of things we are up to\n every day but I&#39;m kind of scrapping for moments when he&#39;s not gaming or\n watching YouTube so I can present something different. <br><br>I also \nsometimes feel like I don&#39;t have the energy to offer more and be a \nreally good unschooling mum to him because the baby takes so much of it.\n So I worry that he&#39;s not doing much because I&#39;m not offering enough. \nThat said, a day when we stay home all day and he gets to do whatever he\n wants on the laptop is what he describes as a perfect day at the \nmoment. <br><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m asking for really. Some\n reassurance that gaming all day is okay. Some ideas of how to create \nmore peace in our house and assurance for my DH that what we&#39;re doing is\n okay. <br><br></div><div>Thanks, <br></div><div>Keelie<br></div>DS 7, DS 1<p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-302311319yui-cursor\"></span></p><p></p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></blockquote></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Finding balance between gaming and other activities","postDate":"1452038288","msgId":76524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFNU1BSMDdNQjM3NkQ3QzIxN0U1M0Y5OUUzRjkyMzA2QjdGMzBAQU1TUFIwN01CMzc2LmV1cnByZDA3LnByb2Qub3V0bG9vay5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG42ZmkxMytxN29yZWhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG42ZmkxMytxN29yZWhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76523,"nextInTopic":76525,"prevInTime":76523,"nextInTime":76525,"topicId":76521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Keelie [&#X1f60a] Firstly, over the past 9 month since we ve lived here I ve seen your DS at various things - parties, trampolining, swimming - both being","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1589711179\">Hey Keelie [&#X1f60a]<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, over the past 9 month since we&#39;ve lived here I&#39;ve seen your DS at various things - parties, trampolining, swimming - both being active and being with friends...he always seems like a happy, friendly kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - it&#39;s only been a year since you started unschooling/properly deschooling. And he&#39;s at the age when kids start to get *really* into gaming...I&#39;d think both those things combined make it likely that yes - gaming is going to be his preferred activity. Also, you said he&#39;s never been all that active anyway -  but after a good long while of deschooling, and being able to play his games unhindered by school or whatever, you might find he&#39;ll want to do more things out of the house eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did get Kai a mini-tramp, but to be honest he doesn&#39;t use it much anymore - he did in the start, but not now the novelty has worn off.  There are less options to be active when kids mostly play on laptops - like your DS and Kai do. But I don&#39;t worry anymore - Kai&#39;s been predominantly gaming on his laptop most days for at least 2 years - he&#39;s still healthy, happy, and more and more keen to do other things outside the house now - like swimming, walking and karate. But it&#39;s not &#39;balanced&#39; - or not how an outsider would see &#39;balanced&#39; - he still games for the better part of most days.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to ask your husband if he thinks that DS would be anymore active if he were at school, sat at a desk all day long? He&#39;d likely be just as stationary. Is it mostly the lack of activity that is worrying your DS? I know your DS has friends, both online and IRL. For many introverted kids, having friends online is so much easier for them anyway - how fantastic they get that opportunity, and aren&#39;t forced to &#39;socialize&#39; with big overwhelming groups of kids everyday! [&#X1f60a]<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, it&#39;s still early days for you all. If you want to post things on the Facebook page for your husband, what about screenshots of things DS is making/doing in his games with exciting captions of what is going on? Is DS interested in going to Eltham H/S park day at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; on behalf of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keeliebean@...\">keeliebean@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: 05 January 2016 04:49<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Finding balance between gaming and other activities<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for just over a year now.

Although my son is happier at home I feel like we are not fully \ntapping into the joyful side of unschooling. <br><br>He is heavily into \ngaming and we&#39;re supporting that interest - we bought a new gaming \nlaptop a few months ago and heaps of new games in the last Steam sale. \nWe&#39;ve also progressed onto more mature games including finally allowing \nhim to play GTA 5. My son really enjoys playing and watching gamers on \nYouTube. We&#39;ve also connected with a few other unschoolers online. I \nwatch and play with him as much as possible although it&#39;s hard to find \nthe time because my 14 month old is very active and if we&#39;re sitting in \nfront of the laptop he wants to touch everything in range. If I&#39;m not \nwith him I&#39;m usually close by. <br><br></div>Although it&#39;s not always easy to see what he is learning I&#39;m confident that he is learning. <br><br></div>The\n issue we have is that he is not very physically active and apart from \nvisiting his friends he rarely wants to go out and do anything. He never\n has been a very active child to be fair but it really worries my DH who\n thinks it&#39;s unhealthy for him to be in front of the computer all day. <br><br></div>So\n I try to introduce other things but generally it&#39;s not met with much \nenthusiasm. A trip out of the house can be spoiled by moaning and \ncontinuously asking to go home even with incentives like ice cream and \nburgers. I invite him to do activities in the backyard and he&#39;s not \ninterested. He has few interests outside of gaming. He doesn&#39;t want to \nuse our pool, he doesn&#39;t like sports, doesn&#39;t want to go the beach, \ndoesn&#39;t want to read stories.

Look for fun ways to get some physical activity while gaming. XBox Kinect, WiiU, and maybe PS4 (I&#39;m not sure) all have features that allow you to play physical games. Trampolines or jumping on the bed are great while watching youtubes. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My son was very much like this at 7. He got into karate at 9 1/2 and now he divides his time between the two. Efforts to get him to be physical just for the sake of it were met with the response you would expect from someone being told &quot;your choice of activity is inferior,&quot; if even for a moment. Work on trust, and play.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dh felt the same way as yours, I think. He tried all sorts of things to get Wallace off the computer. It was mostly a disaster. I mediated it as best I could, and pointed out all the good as often as I could, and was respectful and honest with my husband about his concerns and his right to an opinion on the matter, and he eventually relaxed. We bought some games that he enjoyed, thay they could play together, as a way to connect. The more my son saw his dad taking an interest in his choices, the more respected he felt. Then, when dh asked him if they could do something together that *wasn&#39;t* on the computer, Wallace knew it wasn&#39;t just to get him to stop with the computer, and he was more interested.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was all about relationships and respect, in my home, not ideas about what &quot;should&quot; be happening. When we embraced the former, worries about the latter fell away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":363268824,"authorName":"","from":"keeliebean@...","profile":"keeliereader","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Finding balance between gaming and other activities","postDate":"1451969379","msgId":76521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG42ZmkxMytxN29yZWhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76522,"prevInTime":76520,"nextInTime":76522,"topicId":76521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all, We ve been unschooling for just over a year now.
