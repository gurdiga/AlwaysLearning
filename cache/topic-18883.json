Maybe some day (maybe sooner than we think &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nlearning will no longer be equated with schooling and even schooling <br/>\nwill no longer mean what it does today - lecturing, testing, imposed <br/>\ncurriculum, grades, assignments, and learning during specific <br/>\nhours/days. Until then, it makes sense to me that we are defined by the <br/>\nfact that we do NOT do those things - we do not do school. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntalk about what we do instead - but that is not what distinguishes us <br/>\nfrom how other people educate their children. My oldest daughter went <br/>\nto school until 4th grade. When she was in school she was schooled, but <br/>\nshe also learned &quot;naturally&quot; - she learned through games and <br/>\nconversation and real life, just like she continued to do, later, as an <br/>\nunschooler. The ONLY difference was that when she was in school she was <br/>\nalso &quot;schooled.&quot; We pulled her out and then she was no longer schooled <br/>\n- hence, she &quot;unschooled.&quot; The natural learning just kept right on <br/>\ngoing, through it all. While it is true that unschooled kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe roadblocks in their natural learning pathways that school sets up, <br/>\nto say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; as if kids in school don&#39;t also learn <br/>\n&quot;naturally,&quot; sets up a false dichotomy. Remember, much of what kids <br/>\nlearn in their lives is learned outside of school, naturally, even in <br/>\nspite of lecturing, grading, homework, assignments, and <br/>\none-size-fits-all curriculum. Even though it takes up far more of their <br/>\nlives than seems healthy to us, school isn&#39;t their ENTIRE life and <br/>\nnatural learning happens in schooled kids lives, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to the question, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the term &#39;natural learning&#39; be <br/>\nmore affirming than the use of the negative in the term &#39;unschooling&#39;?&quot; <br/>\nSuzanne Carter, a poet and homeschooling mom, wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as <br/>\nnegative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me <br/>\nunschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing, <br/>\nunfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is posted on the unschooling.com website, along with a number of <br/>\nother comments and definitions on unschooling, at:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/faq/definitions.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/faq/definitions.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18863,"nextTopicId":18889}}
