That is<br/>\nlike many conversations we have here. Each one seems to help build that<br/>\nknowledge base a little bigger and stronger. I bet you are a very<br/>\nappreciated person in this fellow&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Su -- there are people who will LIKE your son for his bluntness.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, no doubt. LOTS of people like him...some are SO delighted with him.<br/>\nAfter all, he is a really likeable dude. Very funny in unique ways, stand-up<br/>\nimprov is his forte&#39;, he is loyal to people and has a very sweet heart. He<br/>\nchose to go to an art school this year, and many people there put him on a<br/>\npedestal...(&quot;so unfettered, unedited&quot;). This is the first year that he has<br/>\nbeen in a circle such as this...they so appreciate his artwork, his insight,<br/>\nhis writings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has his first set of *real* friends too, ones who get him, appreciate<br/>\nhim, really like him. And they guide him when he&#39;s off...too blunt, or too<br/>\ncrass. They&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, that was too much!&quot; He goes out with them<br/>\nindependently, and they play music together on campus sidewalks, and once<br/>\ntook the bus to the airport so they could record the planes taking off and<br/>\nlanding in the background while they played music. He&#39;s really experiencing<br/>\na freedom with friends that is new and exciting, and he is engaging in the<br/>\nintense creativity that he has had his whole life, only with other people<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What he might need is for you to be even more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>clear with him about the consequences of more clearly inappropriate<br/>\nbehaviors - like swearing in places or in front of people where it is<br/>\nclearly not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate this advice. I think we&#39;ve been clear as ice on this...can&#39;t<br/>\nthink of a way to be clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to clarify, he doesn&#39;t do this when he is out with me, it is mostly<br/>\nwhen he is out with his friends, or by himself...both things are new to him,<br/>\nand he&#39;s learning another set of life lessons...ones that I don&#39;t have so<br/>\nmuch control over. But the environment and the people in it are his primary<br/>\nteachers right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Are there times you don&#39;t go places because<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of it? Maybe make more sure he knows he&#39;s limiting his experiences.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;That is the logical reason for not doing it.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I will absolutely not take him places where swearing won&#39;t work unless<br/>\nhe agrees not to. Depending on how much he&#39;d want to go there, he will agree<br/>\nor not go. I personally don&#39;t care about swearing, and would feel<br/>\nhypocritical if I told him he could not swear around me. We have tried that<br/>\nin exercise though, to practice carefully choosing his words, not<br/>\nswearing...he CAN do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know of a way to &quot;make more sure he knows&quot; he is limiting his<br/>\nexperiences... I continue the dialogue, the processing, the pointing out<br/>\nwhat happened because of this or that, why it happened, how it could be<br/>\nbetter next time. It is what we do regularly. I&#39;ve learned that he will be<br/>\nsure to know something when it&#39;s right for him, and I do what I can to get<br/>\nhim there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part to this statement &quot;he&#39;s limiting his experiences&quot; is a pretty<br/>\ncomplex idea, that without him feeling like his experience is limited, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure he would even believe it. *I* may think he is limiting his<br/>\nexperiences, but his actual experience may be perfectly fine for him right<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Anyway - I&#39;m thinking that it doesn&#39;t do any good to complain that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;others are noticing his inappropriate behaviors and being judgmental<br/>\n&gt;&gt;about it&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HA!

My whole  <br/>\nfamily likes him and we frequently invite him to hang out with us and  <br/>\ngo places with us. He is also very blunt and sometimes hurts people&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings. Or he responds in monosyllables with no expression. He once  <br/>\ntold one of my daughters that he didn&#39;t like her. I was shocked and  <br/>\nshe was hurt - but, later, when we were alone, I asked him, &quot;What did  <br/>\nyou mean when you said you don&#39;t like Roxana?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I  <br/>\nmeant I don&#39;t like her.&quot; &quot;Huh, why not?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know her well  <br/>\nenough to really like her, yet.&quot; (True - Roxana hadn&#39;t been around  <br/>\nhim much AND she&#39;s very reserved around people she doesn&#39;t know  <br/>\nwell.) I asked him, &quot;Do you dislike her for some reason? Is there  <br/>\nsomething you don&#39;t like about her?&quot; He was honestly surprised and  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Of course not. I don&#39;t know her well enough to like her, yet,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that Roxana&#39;s feelings had been hurt. He said, &quot;But they  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have been.&quot; I said, &quot;When it comes to feelings, it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmatter what &quot;should&quot; be, it isn&#39;t a matter of logic.&quot; He said, &quot;I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand that.&quot; I said, &quot;I know you don&#39;t - that&#39;s why I&#39;m  <br/>\ntalking about it right now, to help you understand it, because I  <br/>\nreally like you and want you to hang around with us, but if you hurt  <br/>\none of my kids&#39; feelings, it won&#39;t work.&quot; HE said, &quot;I know you guys  <br/>\nlike me, but I don&#39;t know why. I&#39;m not that likable.&quot; I told him that  <br/>\nit was kind of hard to say why people like other people - that it is  <br/>\nmade up of so many variables, but that one of the things I know my  <br/>\nfamily really liked about him was his enthusiasm for learning new  <br/>\nthings and that he was fun to have around because he openly enjoyed  <br/>\nthings. He asked, &quot;Why would she care if I like her or not?&quot; I said,  <br/>\n&quot;Hmmm, good question.&quot; And I was hard-pressed to answer it in a way  <br/>\nthat made sense to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter more discussion, I finally told him that Roxana is sensitive,  <br/>\nalready, about thinking people don&#39;t like her, so, if he wanted to  <br/>\nhang out with our family a lot, I&#39;d appreciate it if he&#39;d be a little  <br/>\nconscious of not saying negative things to her. And I told him that  <br/>\nI&#39;d tell her what he&#39;d meant when he&#39;d said he didn&#39;t like her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - for the next couple of months - he was so careful that he barely  <br/>\nwould speak when Rox was around. Poor guy. Over time, however,  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve gotten to know each other and now they both like each other  <br/>\nand are comfortable with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu -- there are people who will LIKE your son for his bluntness.  <br/>\nOthers will find it uncomfortable. That&#39;s probably going to continue  <br/>\nfor his whole life. What he might need is for you to be even more  <br/>\nclear with him about the consequences of more clearly inappropriate  <br/>\nbehaviors - like swearing in places or in front of people where it is  <br/>\nclearly not acceptable. Are there times you don&#39;t go places because  <br/>\nof it? Maybe make more sure he knows he&#39;s limiting his experiences.  <br/>\nThat is the logical reason for not doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I&#39;m thinking that it doesn&#39;t do any good to complain that  <br/>\nothers are noticing his inappropriate behaviors and being judgmental  <br/>\nabout it - as true as it is, it IS how things are always going to be.  <br/>\nSo that&#39;s just part of the information that he needs to learn to  <br/>\nprocess, right? As his mom, you probably want to pinch people&#39;s  <br/>\npointy little heads off, when they glare at him. You want to say, &quot;He  <br/>\nis LEARNING, give him a break!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - you might think of those people as your aides - if you help him  <br/>\nsee how he is affecting other people (those who glare or move away,  <br/>\netc.), then he has the information he needs to decide how he wants to  <br/>\ncome across, even to strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Cussing","postDate":"1146460131","msgId":25678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VGSkRBQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4RUIwNjczLTBCRTUtNDY1Qi1COERGLTgxRDgxQjdDOThFN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":25666,"nextInTopic":25689,"prevInTime":25677,"nextInTime":25679,"topicId":25559,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think too much, really. If anything, it is more an  inconvenience to<br/>\nhow they have their preferences set.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how can we know how each person&#39;s preferences are set? Some people are<br/>\nfine with freedom of speech, some aren&#39;t. I&#39;m not ready to force conformity<br/>\nto some people&#39;s preferences. But I am fully prepared to continue to give<br/>\nthe true information of the matter...that some people don&#39;t like cussing.<br/>\nAnd that some people see cussing as a &quot;dumbed down&quot; way to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is important, imho, is if a person IS offended, they ask for it to<br/>\nstop. And if a person is asked to stop, they should stop.

Even though ds LOOKS old enough to have his language<br/>\nalways socially appropriate, he doesn&#39;t yet. I can&#39;t push the river, I need<br/>\nto take it just like I took reading, toileting, etc...lots of modeling, lots<br/>\nof information, even limits sometimes (you can&#39;t swear AT people, or hit<br/>\nthem, or put them down). Most of his behavior is completely respectful, he<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t see why people should be offended if he is talking to someone<br/>\nin public that isn&#39;t offended by swearing, and the bystander gets offended.<br/>\nFrankly, I&#39;m not quite sure myself either. Maybe THAT is the problem :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he usually does figure out if the actual person he is talking to will be<br/>\nokay with it. My mother moved in with us a few months ago, and I watched ds<br/>\nease into occasional swearing with her. She has been fine with it. If she<br/>\nsaid to stop, he would have stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS has had to fully immerse himself in this freedom of speech to be where he<br/>\nis now...inching toward balance. Putting a limit on things with him has<br/>\nusually caused an intensified reaction like that of the dangling carrot.

A child was brought from another state to New Mexico  <br/>\nand was saying with high-class-family relatives.  Law enforcement  <br/>\nwould be likely to trust a long-established local family in a small  <br/>\ntown over some young ex spouse from out of state.  Aside from the  <br/>\nquestion of the relative power of legal documents from this state and  <br/>\nthat, the question was whether it seemed worth it for them to drive  <br/>\nten hours to pick her up if the local police weren&#39;t obligated to  <br/>\nassist them remove the child from that home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion wasn&#39;t the deciding factor, but it was one among some.   <br/>\nThe mom&#39;s boyfriend had taken the phone away from here and inserted  <br/>\nhis opinion.  He sounded redneck/biker, hot-headed, expecting a  <br/>\nphysical altercation (or seemed to be assuming or hoping for one) and  <br/>\nboth his tone and his language useage were nervous-making.  He would  <br/>\nhave very negatively impressed the local police in the town in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just one more example for the general considerations.  Even  <br/>\nwithout bad language, someone can make so bad an impression that  <br/>\nthings (big things) won&#39;t go easily in his favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a matter of a personal prejudice on my part, either.  It  <br/>\ninvolved considerations of where the girl&#39;s father was, how connected  <br/>\nhe was, how very reasonable his relatives were being, and how the  <br/>\nmom&#39;s team (she and the boyfriend) were coming across.  The girl will  <br/>\nbe back with her mom a few days or a week later than it might  <br/>\notherwise have been.
