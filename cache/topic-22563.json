I&#39;ve not read the book, but the first few paragraphs of<br/>\nthe review seemed like a nice example of how rewards can have a very<br/>\nunintended result:<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven Levitt&#39;s three-year-old daughter, Amanda, had not long finished<br/>\npotty training when she decided she actually preferred nappies.<br/>\nLevitt&#39;s wife, Jeannette, used all the methods she knew to convince<br/>\nthe toddler otherwise but to no avail. Levitt, the author of hit book<br/>\nFreakonomics, intervened. He promised Amanda some M&M&#39;s whenever she<br/>\nused the potty.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first few days it worked well with sweets changing hands in<br/>\nreturn for timely toilet visits. On the third or fourth day Levitt,<br/>\n38, took Amanda to the toilet. She passed just a dribble and took the<br/>\nsweets. A few minutes later she was back on the toilet, passing yet<br/>\nanother dribble and putting her hand out for yet more sweets. She&#39;d<br/>\nrumbled the system. Levitt smiles.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never thought my three-year-old daughter could outwit my incentives<br/>\nin just three or four days,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&#39;s a great example of how<br/>\nincentives can have unpredictable effects.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22557,"nextTopicId":22329}}
