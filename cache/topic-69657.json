Occasionally, my mother-in-law would call and see how things were going, and I would say &quot;He&#39;s growing like a bad weed.&quot;  I cringe now writing that, but it&#39;s the language I grew up with.  I thought it was wonderful that he was growing so strongly, but my word choice really irritated her.  I wasn&#39;t aware of how negative my description sounded until one day she told me that she really didn&#39;t like that I compared her grandson to a bad weed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I was defensive, but as I thought about it and looked at my beautiful baby, I realized she was right.  That was the beginning of me hearing so many of the negative descriptions and automatic phrases I was using.  It was very humbling, but deeply enlightening also.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law didn&#39;t speak to me unkindly.  She simply told me how she felt about the words I was choosing.  Maybe you could say to your sister something like &quot;It really bothers me when you call my nieces little monsters.&quot;  Let her think about that for a bit.
