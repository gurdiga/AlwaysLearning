He is also into dinosaurs and all animals.  He wants to know what their names mean.  While I look up individual names, it takes awhile, I fall behind on the questions while I look for bits and pieces here and there.  I was wondering if some basic latin might offer us a handful of things that we can refer to on-the-go.  Does anyone have any recommendations on a resource or better idea?  Maybe just a dictionary?!
