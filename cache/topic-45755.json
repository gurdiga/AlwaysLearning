I&#39;m generally a lurker on the list, but your situation struck a chord with me and I had to laugh a bit, as I&#39;ve always felt &#39;isolated&#39; too and we live smack dab in the middle of the USA! We&#39;ve been hm&#39;schooling for about 18 yrs and unschooling for most of those. As far as I know we are the only unschoolers around here. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest dd was young (she&#39;s 24 now) we were very active in the local hm&#39;schooling group as that&#39;s what she wanted. I pretty much kept my mouth shut about how we do or don&#39;t do things. We never fit in very well, because the group here is very &#39;christian&#39; too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow its down to just my youngest dd.. who&#39;s almost 14. We&#39;ve found its best to not dwell on finding others that hm&#39;school let alone unschool.. we pursue what dd is interested in (right now that&#39;s english riding, the whole hunter/jumper horse thing) She&#39;s not made any real &#39;buddies&#39; but she does hang out at the stable a lot and loves talking horse stuff with all the other girls there. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live on a small hobby farm, I raise dairy goats and we have a couple of horses too. My daughter Laura rides a lot with 2 older ladies(my age..ha).. and enjoys their company. It&#39;s funny how age doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re hanging out with people because of a shared interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one close friend who also hm&#39;schools in the traditional manor, and who overlooks my &#39;weird&#39; ways.. and she has 2 kids that my dd likes to hang out with too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have time for another email pal.. you life sounds very interesting and exotic to me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in MO<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;(I live in the cloud forest in Ecuador where there a NO homeschoolers, let alone unschoolers) and wanting a community where my family and I &quot;fit in&quot;, or at least aren&#39;t so strange compared to the rest of the families here in this small town.

It really resonated with my personal situation. When I read the original post, I felt familiar pangs of being far away from like-minded people (I live in the cloud forest in Ecuador where there a NO homeschoolers, let alone unschoolers) and wanting a community where my family and I &quot;fit in&quot;, or at least aren&#39;t so strange compared to the rest of the families here in this small town. I found myself wanting to go down that path of self-pity where I (and in this case our family) am so unique that there&#39;s nobody to relate to..... But then I remember that that path of self-pity gets me nowhere I want to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have chosen to live in this place because it is beautiful, we are surrounded by a mega-diverse forest, the tourism here makes it so that we can run our lodge and stay at home with our kids and do REALLY fun things like ziplining, horse back riding, swimming in the river that is just a few minutes away, we live car-free, we are surrounded by family (my husband&#39;s) that loves us... I could go on and on.... you get the point... I choose to focus on the things that are right in my life instead of the things that are wrong. <br/>\nThese acts of continual gratitude have has helped me embrace this unschooling life fully and have made me a happy person, thus making my children happy people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have close friends here in the small town I live in. I can&#39;t get past talking about the weather or the upcoming elections or local gossip with most people, even my in-laws. I try to find interesting things to do with my girls during the week before 3pm until their friends are free to play. There are two families in Quito, about 3 hours away that we love to hang out with and get to see once every 6 weeks or so. We camp out at their house, or they come to ours. They are by no means unschoolers, but we enjoy each other&#39;s company, the kids get along great and I love getting to spend extended time (1 or 2 days) with them. The visits feel very fulfilling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have let go of thinking that I need people that are just like me in order to be happy with my life here in Ecuador. Obviously that is not something I can have- I am a 6 foot tall white lady living among small, mostly indigenous Ecuadorians. I find pleasure in connecting with people in the community on their level (not that I&#39;m above them or anything, I just feel like I&#39;m on a different plane at times). The grocery store owner and I have a running joke about his obsession with plastic bags and my dedication to my baskets and canvas bags. I wave and chat with folks on the street and play tag with their kids in the main plaza. I seek to fulfill my social needs by visiting my friends in Quito, chatting online with family and friends in the states, phone calls every once in a while and of course, these beloved unschooling lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that my case is rare in its isolation, but my point is that we can seek out connections with people no matter how different they are from us. (okay, so I wouldn&#39;t want to spend considerable time with some of the parents of my kids&#39; friends - but I do hang out because I know it&#39;s important to my children). I would love to live in a strong unschooling community, but until that happens I&#39;ll keep shooting the shit with man at the grocery store and trying not to roll my eyes when a friend of my daughters&#39; can&#39;t come over because she hasn&#39;t taken a bath.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 6/8/2009 9:34 AM, tsmaddox2001 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Always Learning has changed the way I parent, and now I am even further from the larger pool of potential friends as a Radical Parent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does your financial situation allow you to make it to any of the <br/>\n&gt; unschooling conferences?

I&#39;ll just list the issues and maybe some of you can relate and write back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I decided together to do all these things starting in 1998:<br/>\n<br/>\nWork less and downsize<br/>\nAdopt kids from China<br/>\nUnplug the TV<br/>\nBecome vegetarian<br/>\nHomeschool our kids<br/>\nBecome vegan <br/>\nUnschool our kids<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer my husband of 16 years died quite suddenly from cancer.  While trolling for and signing up for grief support groups, I somehow found your group. Always Learning has changed the way I parent, and now I am even further from the larger pool of potential friends as a Radical Parent.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel lucky to have many friends who would do anything for me and my kids.  All these friends have been accepting and supportive of the paths we&#39;ve chosen but they don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; me.  Sometimes, I can hardly stand to be around their families as they demand chores, obedience, and homeschool work from their kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sold our little vegan natural grocery store when my husband died so now I am a SAHM.  I am learning to love life again, albeit with a broken heart. I feel that radical parenting and unschooling are the most loving and natural things I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I am committed to this path.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout my husband as a partner in all things, I want to move to a place where I will be in a community of like-minded people.
