It has been really hard to <br/>\nget the other girls out of the pool - I suspect they don&#39;t get much <br/>\nswimming. But I will work on that and get their mom on my side too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe running interference with the other kids - well first I have to get over <br/>\nmy own dislike of them. My brain has seized up with sleeplessness and relief <br/>\n(I have heard back from the mom in response to my epistle - more below - <br/>\noooooh gossip - well not entirely) and right now I can&#39;t think of anything <br/>\nthat I could engage with them that would not be equally attractive to Jayn&#39;s <br/>\nfriends. Jayn is already frustrated when James gets out his nintendo or <br/>\nother gadget and the moths fly to his flame. But it is worth some thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I am quite touched by your offer. I&#39;m not sure who I could ask about <br/>\nmediating. I have a feeling there would already be a strong anti-Jayn <br/>\ncontingent primed. She fits in with the home schoolers. I so don&#39;t. I just <br/>\nwant to have as little connection as humanly possible while maintaining <br/>\nreasonable politeness. I may have put the kibosh on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor is it likely to be necessary to seek a mediator, since I have received a <br/>\nrather backtracking email. Rather like some of the ones we see here when <br/>\npeople try to say, &quot;I didn&#39;t say that&quot;, but lo there it is in black and <br/>\nwhite in the archives....unlike in the past, I am not going to stand by and <br/>\nlet her lie to me about what she intended. After calling Jayn names, I am <br/>\nnot allowing her to deny that she said it, by the simple expedient of <br/>\nquoting her back to herself. She is also being entirely disingenous about <br/>\nher dd&#39;s intention (not that I used those accusatory words to her), not <br/>\nrealizing that by quoting a conversation she had with K she has revealed her <br/>\nfull knowledge of K&#39;s plan to join in, not just exercise her right to swim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmongst other stuff I sent this - I think all the BS of the recent past has <br/>\ncaught up with me. This is really approaching the end of the limb stuff for <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;Your description of your prepping conversation with Karine show that <br/>\nyou probably suspected there might be some kind of issue. Wouldn&#39;t it have <br/>\nbeen         kinder to Karine, let alone Jayn,  for *you* to take the <br/>\ninitiative to check with Jayn and I first? We could been the ones talking it <br/>\nover, shielding Karine from     Jayn&#39;s first fear, and then you could have <br/>\nprepped Karine not to expect to be able to join Jayn, and I could have <br/>\nreassured Jayn that Karine would not spoil     her playdate by going <br/>\nswimming, so she would have been more welcoming.<br/>\n<br/>\n     When you have visitors these days I make it clear that Jayn must not <br/>\ntry to join in, even though she often has wanted to. I keep Jayn with me and <br/>\nfind stuff to     do. Beyond a quick word of hello, I discourage her from <br/>\nwatching. I sometimes even take her out if she seems to want to persist in <br/>\nlurking on the balcony, in     order to protect your kids&#39; playtime from her <br/>\nintensity. As I said, we are certain to have many common acquaintances, but <br/>\nthat is no reason for anyone to         believe they are entitled to an <br/>\ninvitation to play with the other&#39;s visitors. I should think that there are <br/>\nenough disparate ages and interests that the friendships         need not <br/>\noverlap so very much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I just got fed up, and recalling a hundred other slights, which truly I <br/>\nthough I had taken the high road on....and still some interesting <br/>\nunschooling principles...<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Just to touch on a slightly wider issue, you accuse us of being <br/>\ninconsiderate. Yes it is true that everyone here has the *Right* to use the <br/>\npool at any time, and     it is a common area, just like the table and the <br/>\nbarbeque - but there is such a thing as kindness and generosity. We don&#39;t <br/>\nalways have to insist upon our             rights  every time, do we? We can <br/>\nchoose to step aside out of thoughtfulness for others and others&#39; rights, <br/>\nand say to ourselves, &quot;Well there are some visitors     using the pool, and <br/>\nsince it is a relatively rare occurence, I can choose to take the higher <br/>\npath and allow them to use it undisturbed.&quot; I have done that many <br/>\ntimes over the years, even before you moved here, and guided Jayn in that <br/>\ndirection, and I know that others of our neighbors have also just refrained <br/>\nfrom         intruding on someone&#39;s private swim, solitary or otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am reminded of the time when [her dh] came home quite early in the day <br/>\nas the sun was high with A... & K..., and Jayn was swimming with her father. <br/>\nThese rare swims are always relatively brief since James gets cold quickly. <br/>\nA... and K... immediately declared their intention of swimming. Jayn, in <br/>\nsoft,             gentle and kind words, as I stood near her, begged, begged <br/>\nyour kids to just let her finish her swim alone with her dad, just for <br/>\nanother 10 minutes until he         got out. They refused. [Her dh] backed <br/>\nthem up citing their &quot;right&quot; to swim.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I moved on to repeating my request for her to tell me when she is going <br/>\nto be out, so that maybe I can get in one more swimming playdate before we <br/>\ngo onto nights and the pool goes off at Halloween.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the spirit of Mea Culpa... I&#39;m not sure that I have done the right <br/>\nthing.  But gosh I feel better for not taking the appeasement route just <br/>\nthis once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I regularly say <br/>\nno. Largely because Linnaea doesn&#39;t like this girl very much. She doesn&#39;t <br/>\ndislike her, and they can play well together, but Linnaea can get frustrated <br/>\nplaying with her fairly quickly and a 6 hour playdate is much longer than <br/>\nshe can sustain. Anyhow, when she does come over I tend to be the backup <br/>\ncompanion. I make sure I am there to be the friend and playmate to this <br/>\nolder sister when I can see that Linnaea is ready to move away from playing <br/>\nwith her. I have to be prepared to do that when I commit to having Linnaea&#39;s <br/>\nfriend and her sister over. It may be that part of your commitment to having <br/>\nfriends over for Jayn is to run distraction for these neighbors. <br/>\nParticularly as Jayn wants to remain friends with the neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there ways that you could circumvent their approach so that they didn&#39;t <br/>\nmake it into the circle of activity? Are there things you can have as a <br/>\n&quot;just in case&quot; that would be interesting and engaging that you could do with <br/>\nthe neighbor kids so that Jayn could get on and play with her guests? Y&#39;know <br/>\nthings like calling them in for a snack or a movie or something, and talk it <br/>\nover with Jayn beforehand so that she might be more willing to exchange the <br/>\npool for coming indoors when her play with these friends is going to be <br/>\ninfringed upon by her neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like it&#39;s always friends.

We have<br/>\none of those in our neighborhood right now.  The girls are Margaux&#39;s<br/>\nage, but Margaux won&#39;t have anything to do with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a LOT of kids in our cul-de-sac right now that are all around<br/>\nMargaux&#39;s age and they all seem to play with these two girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux&#39;s reason for not playing with them is because they don&#39;t play<br/>\nnice, they have that typical school playground behavior, taunting,<br/>\nbullying, and such.  On one occasion Margaux and another neighbor girl<br/>\nwere out trying to join their play and were mercilessly taunted and when<br/>\nthey tried to stand up for themselves in their child ways, the kids<br/>\ntattled on them to their mother who, without having been involved at<br/>\nall, yelled at Margaux and her friend and gave them that whole &quot;nobody<br/>\ntreats my kids that way&quot; kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux&#39;s friend lives right across the way from us and knows these<br/>\ngirls from school.  She doesn&#39;t play with them in school either because<br/>\nshe thinks they are mean.  There is an older lady that lives to doors<br/>\ndown from us (we have a very large cul-de-sac sort of thing with three<br/>\noffshoots off the main one) that watches her grandson on a regular<br/>\nbasis.  She&#39;s outside a lot doing yardwork and sees and hears everything<br/>\nin the neighborhood.  She absolutely will not let her grandson play with<br/>\nthese girls either because they threatened to kill him when they were<br/>\nplaying.  She lets him come play with Margaux though, actually he&#39;s a<br/>\ncute kid who has a little kid crush on her, so I doubt she could keep<br/>\nhim away... but it goes to say that I&#39;m not the only one who observes<br/>\nthis behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t know why all the other kids put up with it and all the<br/>\nother parents seem to be fine with this sort of behavior.  Most of them<br/>\nare no where to be seen though, so I guess they don&#39;t know anything<br/>\nabout it.  I&#39;m not one of those kind of parents, I like to be present,<br/>\nat least within earshot of neighborhood outdoor play when my daughter is<br/>\nout there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were gone last week, we had new neighbors move in that live<br/>\nright across the way from us that have kids Margaux&#39;s age.  She was<br/>\nreally excited to come home and meet them, but found out that those<br/>\nneighbor girls walk them home from school each and every day, so Margaux<br/>\nwon&#39;t go out there to meet them.  When I tried to encourage her to go<br/>\nout anyway, just to introduce herself, she said to me, &quot;mom, it&#39;s not<br/>\nworth it, I have one nice friend and I&#39;m fine with only having one!&quot;. <br/>\nSo, point taken, but I gave her some things to say to the mean mom, if<br/>\nshe ever did decide to go out and play and got yelled at by her again. <br/>\nI told her to put her hands on her hips and say loudly and firmly &quot;Do<br/>\nnot talk to me in that manner.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a strange neighborhood.  The kids all run around completely<br/>\nunsupervised and behave badly towards one another and all the other<br/>\nparents seem fine with this until one of their own kids get hurt and<br/>\nthen they come out of their house all full of fire looking to blame<br/>\nsomeone and yell at whatever child &quot;hurt&quot; their kid.  I&#39;ve seen it<br/>\nhappen over and over again, even though some have moved out and others<br/>\nhave moved in, this seems to be the standard mode of operation around<br/>\nhere.  I find it disgusting, so I&#39;m glad that Margaux has more self<br/>\nrespect than to put up with it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one friend that she has, has an awesome mom, pretty young and<br/>\nsingle, so her daughter is a daycare kid who has some of those kind of<br/>\nobvious traights, but I love the mom anyway, she&#39;s by far the most<br/>\nnormal other person in our neighbor in regards to how she wathces and<br/>\nmonitors her daughter and her daughter&#39;s friends and actually seems to<br/>\ncare wether or not she&#39;s safe and getting along.  The kids spend equal<br/>\namount of time at each of our houses, which to me is a good sign that<br/>\nthings are cool, because we&#39;ve had other kids who only want to spend<br/>\ntime at our house because theirs sucks and my kid (I&#39;m more thinking of<br/>\nChamille here) thought so too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m all for avoidance of kids and parents like the ones you describe. <br/>\nConfrontation with that sort of parent never seems to go anywhere. <br/>\nHowever, I did like Sandra&#39;s idea of having witnesses and a discussion,<br/>\nalthough, in reality I wouldn&#39;t even begin to know how that would look<br/>\nsince I&#39;ve never gotten that far with a parent like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, it is most definitely fall, the air is cold and wet and kids are<br/>\nstaying indoors.  Next summer will be more telling!  This cul-de-sac has<br/>\nthe most amount of kids than I&#39;ve ever seen in the 5 yrs that we&#39;ve<br/>\nlived here, something like almost every single house has a kid or 2,<br/>\nmost of them elementary school age.

I regularly say no. Largely because Linnaea doesn&#39;t like this girl very much. She doesn&#39;t dislike her, and they can play well together, but Linnaea can get frustrated playing with her fairly quickly and a 6 hour playdate is much longer than she can sustain. Anyhow, when she does come over I tend to be the backup companion. I make sure I am there to be the friend and playmate to this older sister when I can see that Linnaea is ready to move away from playing with her. I have to be prepared to do that when I commit to having Linnaea&#39;s friend and her sister over. It may be that part of your commitment to having friends over for Jayn is to run distraction for these neighbors. Particularly as Jayn wants to remain friends with the neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there ways that you could circumvent their approach so that they didn&#39;t make it into the circle of activity? Are there things you can have as a &quot;just in case&quot; that would be interesting and engaging that you could do with the neighbor kids so that Jayn could get on and play with her guests? Could you time indoor activities for the moment when you see the neighbors approaching so that you could call Jayn and her guests in before any potentially negative interaction occurs? Y&#39;know things like calling them in for a snack or a movie or something, and talk it over with Jayn beforehand so that she might be more willing to exchange the pool for coming indoors when her play with these friends is going to be infringed upon by her neighbors. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like it&#39;s always friends.

I asked the mom to check and see if he had a black wooden box  <br/>\nunder his bed.  She came back and said &quot;Yes, but he says it&#39;s   <br/>\nhis.&quot;   Huh.

A public pool or another park or<br/>\n&gt; somewhere they can run around and play but not be seeming (to the<br/>\n&gt; neighbors) to flaunt their &quot;you can&#39;t play&quot; time. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard for me to hear that Jayn was flaunting her playdates, but I <br/>\nsuppose that is the kind of thought they would have. I have no way of <br/>\nknowing (yet) when they will be here or not when I make the date a week in <br/>\nadvance. We have had four wonderful playdates with the same girls when my <br/>\nneighbors were out for the day, which I am still hoping will be the best <br/>\nsolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not at all simple to go to a public pool, although not impossible. Most <br/>\nof the nearish municipal ones are already closed for the winter, and the <br/>\nYMCA costs money and has very limited time family swims during the week - <br/>\nlike an hour and a half. Luckily in a few weeks using the pool won&#39;t be part <br/>\nof the equation, and I am certainly willing to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jayn has <br/>\nguests right now&quot; at my own front door, and encourage them to stay inside. I <br/>\nam going to see if they would be willing to not swim at all, and to play <br/>\ninside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not as simple as meeting at a park, and they do meet up at a park once <br/>\na week after dance class. At our house, in addition to swimming, they watch <br/>\ndvd&#39;s, make up plays, do dress up, play dolls, do coloring, eat - and by the <br/>\nway these are the first drop off playdates that I have been emotionally able <br/>\nto do  - and they haven&#39;t been disasters. I can&#39;t, just can&#39;t (hear my <br/>\npanic), supervise all three at a public pool or park without the other mom <br/>\n(who also has a four year old son, and seems to be really loving the <br/>\narrangement).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m crying now because to please someone who wouldn&#39;t have a moments pause <br/>\ntelling Jayn she can&#39;t join them if they have visitors, and has repeatedly <br/>\nspoken to her harshly when she has knocked at their door, used mean words to <br/>\nJayn that she would never think of using to her own kids, whose kids have <br/>\nbeen cruel enough to make her cry, I would have to totally destroy something <br/>\nreally special that my daughter and her two girl friends have started to <br/>\ntreasure. They hate to leave, they can&#39;t wait to come back, they want to do <br/>\na slumber party without the sleepover. I was so happy that finally Jayn was <br/>\nreaching out to some newer, nicer friends, and so delighted with how much <br/>\nfun they were having in the water and out, how many interests they seem to <br/>\nshare. I&#39;ve loved listening to how they plan their next game, how they <br/>\nlisten to each other and negotiate and are willing to be generous with each <br/>\nother. They&#39;ve been happy yet quiet even in the pool - when the neighbor <br/>\nkids are in the water, other neighbors complain about the level of ruckus. <br/>\nThere haven&#39;t been any pushing &quot;games&quot; (thinly veneered aggression outlets), <br/>\nor roughhousing, or falling over incidents which are all too common with the <br/>\nA & K around the pool. All of these wonders have happened because it has <br/>\nbeen just them without the distractions and demands of a larger group or the <br/>\nlengthy onerous rules of public pools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen these neighbor kids in our house ignore Jayn in order to play <br/>\nher x-box and her nintendo, and tell her she can&#39;t use a particular doll <br/>\nbecause they want it, and carry toys to under the table and arrange the <br/>\npillows so that she can&#39;t fit in the fort. And she is so extremely generous <br/>\nand usually says OK to their requests and gives them her candies and offers <br/>\nthem cupcakes and tells me to save some cookies for them and constantly is <br/>\non the lookout for stuffed toys or other things they might like and wants me <br/>\nto get them as gifts. I made a rule, as distasteful as it was, that Jayn <br/>\ndidn&#39;t leave any toys down there overnight, because if she did they would <br/>\ndeclare that they owned them when she came to collect them. Instead of just <br/>\nsaying, &quot;No that&#39;s Jayn&#39;s&quot; (and you know they have few toys so it&#39;s not like <br/>\nthe doll is disappearing in a crowd of similar items) their mom would lead <br/>\nthem in a long sing-songy &quot;what do you remember...&quot; which tended to be <br/>\nfilled with, let&#39;s just say fantasies of wishful thinking. Everyone&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;opinion&quot; is to be given equal weight, even when it is plainly in contrast <br/>\nto the observed facts or her certain knowledge. While Jayn stands there <br/>\ncrying because K. won&#39;t hand the doll back. I also learnt to put Jayn&#39;s <br/>\ninitials on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when it&#39;s the next playdate with some other child?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy neighbor goes to all the local park days, even the unschooling one. She <br/>\nand her kids are likely to know or recognize almost everyone we know. That <br/>\ncan&#39;t be a good enough reason why Jayn should be forced to share something, <br/>\nsharing that amounts to giving it up completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not like it&#39;s constant. Remember we spend over one third of our <br/>\ntime on nights, when we are not using the pool at all, and not having any <br/>\nvisitors. The other kids have free reign over the pool and courtyard then, <br/>\nand we don&#39;t even know about it. They can&#39;t let us have it three or maybe <br/>\nfour afternoons over the course five weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I can&#39;t control this, but I just wish the mom would act to help her <br/>\nkids feel better and maybe distract or explain, and not tell me that Jayn <br/>\nhas to be ordered to let them &quot;spoil&quot; (in Jayn&#39;s words) her playdate.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I hope that you can<br/>\nhelp make this clear to Jayn that these kinds of requests are simply not an<br/>\noption.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Now these were kids that Jayn and I had invited for the purpose of<br/>\nplaying with Jayn. Simply because Jayn wishes so should be enough, and how<br/>\nthey spent their morning is nothing to do with me. I don&#39;t invite children<br/>\nto play at our house, give them lots of snacks and food, help them with all<br/>\nkinds of toys and costumes, and watch their plays, for any other purpose<br/>\nthan for Jayn to play with them. These girls love coming here, and this is<br/>\nthe first time I realized that they even knew our neighbors at all. Here&#39;s<br/>\nan analogy: It&#39;s like a lady went to lunch with a colleague yesterday, so<br/>\nshe should feel free to join him and his date when she notices him by chance<br/>\nat the same neighborhood eatery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The history of that family is one of self first, last and always. I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen their behavior in museums. If I started saying that her children<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t make requests of Jayn, (and they are often brusque and demanding<br/>\nIMO), if I used that &quot;not an option&quot; language the other woman would be<br/>\noutraged. Her children&#39;s feelings are all that matters in public situations<br/>\nor private ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There have been a couple of times in the past when James and Jayn have<br/>\nbeen playing in the pool (which is not a real big one btw) and they have<br/>\ncome home from somewhere and immediately announced that they are going<br/>\nswimming - as is their right. Jayn has really sweetly asked if they would<br/>\nmind waiting just a little while so that she can finish swimming alone with<br/>\nher dad (which is never long because James get cold and earachey pretty<br/>\nfast) but they have said no, and refused, and been totally backed up by<br/>\ntheir parents - with a lot of jargon thrown around. Yes it was their right<br/>\nto use the pool, but it isn&#39;t kind, or neighborly, or considerate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  And I find it really annoying that she can appear to be so reasonable and<br/>\nopen to negotiate, but I have come to the conclusion that she is using the<br/>\nlanguage of mindful parenting, the jargon of it, as a means of exerting<br/>\ncontrol. There is a hypocrisy there, a two facedness - and her kids are<br/>\nsneakier, and more aggressive than she ever likes to admit. I have the<br/>\nemails to prove that last point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  When Jayn plays with them she always comes back changed for while, more<br/>\nbeligerent, more demanding, more cranky, not relaxed or joyful, as she<br/>\nrecovers from being in a very rule bound home - but always expressed *as if*<br/>\nthe children had a choice even though they really don&#39;t. However having been<br/>\nthrough the difference (in Jayn&#39;s response and recovery) between merely<br/>\nnot-very-nice kids and a truly toxic personality, I have been trying to help<br/>\nJayn keep the relationship alive. Jayn likes these kids, although less than<br/>\nshe used to as she gradually sees more kindly people. This is the same mom<br/>\nwho I posted about recently who wasn&#39;t willing to be a visual presence. I<br/>\nfeel like I am sliding into one of those nasty situations, again like I<br/>\nposted about recently - the temptation to let the relationship implode.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  These kids have a lot of suppressed anger I think. They come to our house<br/>\nto use Jayn&#39;s things. Their mom regularly purges their toys to the Goodwill,<br/>\nso that even 6 months after giving a carefully thought out gift for a<br/>\nbirthday, it&#39;s gone. Yes I feel a bit resentful. And then they are coming to<br/>\nour house to use Jayn&#39;s similar toys. I think Jayn is beginning to see that<br/>\na lot of it is a one way street.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I hate confrontation. I hate it,hate it, hate it.I hate feeling afraid<br/>\nand embarrassed. I feel like moving out tomorrow but we can&#39;t afford to do<br/>\nso. The reason I would want to remain cordial is because Jayn still<br/>\nconsiders these two to be her friends. I have fantasies about screaming<br/>\n&quot;keep your horrible children away from my daughter&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My neighbor&#39;s wish is that I lay down some rules to Jayn about<br/>\nsuppressing her own desires. I think the whole sadness could have been<br/>\navoided if the mom had been a bit more circumspect, as I am with Jayn when<br/>\nthey have guests, and said something like what I have said, &quot;It looks like A<br/>\n& K are busy with some visitors.Let&#39;s wait and play later.&quot; Or just said<br/>\n&quot;Hi&quot; in passing. Or come out herself and checked with Jayn before<br/>\nencouraging K to come out. Or maybe, possibly spent a single minute talking<br/>\nabout being kind to our neighbors, instead of insisting on &quot;rights&quot;. It is<br/>\ntrue that sometimes I have had a battle to bring Jayn in from the balcony,<br/>\nwhen she is not welcome to play (and I guess it&#39;s ok for *her* kids to tell<br/>\nJayn &quot;you can&#39;t play with me and my friend&quot; but not ok for mine to feel the<br/>\nsame way.) But I do it, and sometimes I even take her out rather than have<br/>\nher suffer from watching, or let her be intrusive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Jayn *needs* these one- or two-on-one playdates. Groups and park days are<br/>\nonly part of the picture. Should she be required to share her friends when<br/>\nthey come over?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I have suggested that I arrange future playdates for times when they will<br/>\nbe out anyway, if it is possible, but I have not heard back yet. Here is<br/>\npart of my response, directly in response to the above quote (feeling<br/>\noutraged at the hyporcrisy of that is hard to get past):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I agree that the pool is a communal space, and I have expressed that to<br/>\nJayn. Indeed I was saying so again from the balcony at the time, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink you heard me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  However muscling in on Jayn&#39;s playdate and changing the dynamic, just<br/>\nbecause you happen to know the visitors from another place is another<br/>\nmatter. From Jayn&#39;s point of view Karine and Alan were being very<br/>\ndisrespectful of her and her time to play with these special friends. I do<br/>\nnot think accepting such behavior is a reasonable requirement to make of<br/>\nJayn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I am NOT at all willing to tell her that &quot;asking for her space&quot; (her<br/>\nexpression tonight that she tells me she learnt from you) to play alone with<br/>\nher guests is &quot;not an option&quot;. I WILL coach her to be less reactive and<br/>\nkinder in her expression, BUT she has every right to play with only her<br/>\nvisitors regardless of whether your kids know them or have spent time with<br/>\nthem earlier (as do A... and K.... when they have guests). &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Help! I need some perspective, or better words or something. I&#39;m really<br/>\nstruggling with trying to see her point of view. I think I believe that I<br/>\nshould do so, that I should be reasonable, that I should give her my<br/>\nassumption of good intentions. I also feel like I have done this so often,<br/>\nso greatly and let so much slide that I am close to fed up with the whole<br/>\nrelationship. I do know that I will want to be extra vigilant during any<br/>\nimminent interactions between Jayn and our neighbors, especially the boy,<br/>\nbecause historically there has often been a little bit of underhanded<br/>\nrevenge nastiness, usually verbal, sometimes physical (like the mean<br/>\nspirited hand circling) - and I have seen Jayn just look baffled since this<br/>\nkind of thing goes right past her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Pam, one of the reasons I am so willing to drive all the way to<br/>\nDragontree, aside from the delight of seeing you and the soul&#39;s joy of just<br/>\nbeing around other lovely unschoolers, is that I am almost entirely unlikely<br/>\nto meet up with these neighbors there. That is not the case with any of the<br/>\nother park days that are more local to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Every time it&#39;s a problem with neighbors...it must be me. Is it me? Does<br/>\nit count that James can&#39;t stand &#39;em? Solving the social stuff with<br/>\nunschoolers never seems to be this hard or fear inducing.

Jayn has really sweetly asked if they would mind waiting just a little while so that she can finish swimming alone with her dad (which is never long because James get cold and earachey pretty fast) but they have said no, and refused, and been totally backed up by their parents - with a lot of jargon thrown around. Yes it was their right to use the pool, but it isn&#39;t kind, or neighborly, or considerate. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I find it really annoying that she can appear to be so reasonable and open to negotiate, but I have come to the conclusion that she is using the language of mindful parenting, the jargon of it, as a means of exerting control. There is a hypocrisy there, a two facedness - and her kids are sneakier, and more aggressive than she ever likes to admit. I have the emails to prove that last point. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn plays with them she always comes back changed for while, more beligerent, more demanding, more cranky, not relaxed or joyful, as she recovers from being in a very rule bound home - but always expressed *as if* the children had a choice even though they really don&#39;t. However having been through the difference (in Jayn&#39;s response and recovery) between merely not-very-nice kids and a truly toxic personality, I have been trying to help Jayn keep the relationship alive. Jayn likes these kids, although less than she used to as she gradually sees more kindly people. This is the same mom who I posted about recently who wasn&#39;t willing to be a visual presence. I feel like I am sliding into one of those nasty situations, again like I posted about recently - the temptation to let the relationship implode. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese kids have a lot of suppressed anger I think. They come to our house to use Jayn&#39;s things. Their mom regularly purges their toys to the Goodwill, so that even 6 months after giving a carefully thought out gift for a birthday, it&#39;s gone. Yes I feel a bit resentful. And then they are coming to our house to use Jayn&#39;s similar toys. I think Jayn is beginning to see that a lot of it is a one way street.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate confrontation. I hate it,hate it, hate it.I hate feeling afraid and embarrassed. I feel like moving out tomorrow but we can&#39;t afford to do so. The reason I would want to remain cordial is because Jayn still considers these two to be her friends. I have fantasies about screaming &quot;keep your horrible children away from my daughter&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy neighbor&#39;s wish is that I lay down some rules to Jayn about suppressing her own desires. I think the whole sadness could have been avoided if the mom had been a bit more circumspect, as I am with Jayn when they have guests, and said something like what I have said, &quot;It looks like A & K are busy with some visitors.Let&#39;s wait and play later.&quot; Or just said &quot;Hi&quot; in passing. Or come out herself and checked with Jayn before encouraging K to come out. Or maybe, possibly spent a single minute talking about being kind to our neighbors, instead of insisting on &quot;rights&quot;. It is true that sometimes I have had a battle to bring Jayn in from the balcony, when she is not welcome to play (and I guess it&#39;s ok for *her* kids to tell Jayn &quot;you can&#39;t play with me and my friend&quot; but not ok for mine to feel the same way.) But I do it, and sometimes I even take her out rather than have her suffer from watching, or let her be intrusive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn *needs* these one- or two-on-one playdates. Groups and park days are only part of the picture. Should she be required to share her friends when they come over? <br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested that I arrange future playdates for times when they will be out anyway, if it is possible, but I have not heard back yet. Here is part of my response, directly in response to the above quote (feeling outraged at the hyporcrisy of that is hard to get past):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I agree that the pool is a communal space, and I have expressed that to Jayn. Indeed I was saying so again from the balcony at the time, but I don&#39;t think you heard me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever muscling in on Jayn&#39;s playdate and changing the dynamic, just because you happen to know the visitors from another place is another matter. From Jayn&#39;s point of view Karine and Alan were being very disrespectful of her and her time to play with these special friends. I do not think accepting such behavior is a reasonable requirement to make of Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT at all willing to tell her that &quot;asking for her space&quot; (her expression tonight that she tells me she learnt from you) to play alone with her guests is &quot;not an option&quot;. I WILL coach her to be less reactive and kinder in her expression, BUT she has every right to play with only her visitors regardless of whether your kids know them or have spent time with them earlier (as do A... and K.... when they have guests). &quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\nHelp! I need some perspective, or better words or something. I&#39;m really struggling with trying to see her point of view. I think I believe that I should do so, that I should be reasonable, that I should give her my assumption of good intentions. I also feel like I have done this so often, so greatly and let so much slide that I am close to fed up with the whole relationship. I do know that I will want to be extra vigilant during any imminent interactions between Jayn and our neighbors, especially the boy, because historically there has often been a little bit of underhanded revenge nastiness, usually verbal, sometimes physical (like the mean spirited hand circling) - and I have seen Jayn just look baffled since this kind of thing goes right past her. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam, one of the reasons I am so willing to drive all the way to Dragontree, aside from the delight of seeing you and the soul&#39;s joy of just being around other lovely unschoolers, is that I am almost entirely unlikely to meet up with these neighbors there. That is not the case with any of the other park days that are more local to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time it&#39;s a problem with neighbors...it must be me. Is it me? Does it count that James can&#39;t stand &#39;em? Solving the social stuff with unschoolers never seems to be this hard or fear inducing. Makes me want to move to a cave somewhere....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
