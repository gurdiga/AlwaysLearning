There seem to be a lot of defensive comments around this<br/>\nissue.  I&#39;m curious as to why whenever I say simply that I don&#39;t eat meat -- a<br/>\nsingle, simple sentence, lacking judgemental adjectives of any kind -- I find<br/>\nmyself offending people who a) assume that I&#39;m judging negatively their choice to<br/>\neat meat and b) feel the need to tell me in detail (and often a combative tone)<br/>\nwhy they think that meat-eating is good (or at least not bad) for you.  I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthe same thing happens when I say that I don&#39;t drink (at least not much, at least<br/>\nnot anymore &lt;g&gt;) or that I don&#39;t smoke.  Now I see the same kind of defensive<br/>\nresponses regarding the justification of tv viewing, which some of us may find to<br/>\nbe, like drinking or meat-eating, not the healthiest choice available.  I think we<br/>\ncan learn from these posts to communicate less defensively.  In fact, I wonder if<br/>\nthe judgemental adjective &quot;ugly&quot; had not been used, if this whole flood of<br/>\npro-tv-justification would have been avoided?  I certainly hope so...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;d like to repeat someone else&#39;s comment regarding the AAP -- a pretty<br/>\nconservative group -- which can provide references and resources regarding the<br/>\nnegative effects of TV viewing on little minds.  I believe they also suggest that<br/>\nTV can be too stimulating or distracting for &quot;spirited&quot; kids.  Therefore, given<br/>\nthat advice, please don&#39;t treat those of us who avoid the tube as luddites who are<br/>\ntrying to shelter our kids from &quot;beautiful&quot; entertainment.

That&#39;s fine.  But as<br/>\nI said, I suspect that their children do not become apathetic, miserable<br/>\nwhiners after watching TV.<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have certainly done their share of miserable, apathetic whining.<br/>\nWhen Brit was 4, I spent about six weeks convinced that I was up for Worst<br/>\nMommy of the Year because the child could not NOT burst into tears 430 times<br/>\nper day, every day, with or without perceivable provocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the best of my fuzzy memory, she was not watching any more or less TV<br/>\nduring that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my friend Paula sent me a book called &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; and I read<br/>\nit and a huge weight was lifted as I read that four year olds do this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t let me off the hook for making sure that her environment was safe<br/>\nand pleasant, but it let me be much calmer inside that it was not something<br/>\nhideous I was doing to her, and that helped us both a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael-Anne turned 4 in October, and is occasionally weepy, which is<br/>\nstrange and bizarre behavior for her, and so I changed some things around<br/>\nthat I could change (she wants to stay home a lot, so Wally and I have made<br/>\nit a priority to let her have that option as much as possible) and I&#39;m<br/>\npaying attention to what she seems to need and we&#39;re waiting it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I eat carrots and then get in the car and have an accident, it does not<br/>\nmean that carrots cause traffic accidents. If my child watches TV and is<br/>\nwhiney and miserable, the fault is not necessarily with the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if I was convinced it was the TV, I would not arbitrarily banish or<br/>\nlimit it. I would have absolutely no way of knowing how much TV that child<br/>\ncould handle on a given day, or when that ability changed to less or more. I<br/>\nwould try, however, to help them identify what they were feeling and see<br/>\nwhat we could do to make it better. There are lots of options along &quot;make it<br/>\nbetter&quot; other than &quot;get rid of the TV&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this whole argument of &quot;well, your children are just<br/>\ndifferent than mine&quot; is that it can be given to anything -- I know several<br/>\nwomen who were convinced they didn&#39;t have enough milk to breastfeed: did<br/>\nthat make all of them, or most of them, or ANY of them right? Probably not.<br/>\nBut I got the, &quot;well, I&#39;m just different than you&quot; speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren (and people, and things living and not) are all different, but IMHO<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t excuse parental interference in a child&#39;s search of balance.<br/>\nPart of unschooling is trust, and that includes in our house trusting them<br/>\nto find their own checks and balances, with what help we adults can provide<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t interfere with or over-ride or ignore their own knowledge of<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82903808,"authorName":"Earth Witch","from":"Earth Witch &lt;the_earth_witch@...&gt;","profile":"the_earth_witch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV","postDate":"1012248089","msgId":3164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI4MjAwMTI5LjMxMTY5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwOTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDNTU5MzU4LjNFOTJCQzNEQHdvcmxkbmV0LmF0dC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3160,"nextInTopic":3186,"prevInTime":3163,"nextInTime":3165,"topicId":3129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think if a parent is describing their child that way and the child s behavior is negative, it has a lot more to do with their relationship than the tv.

Personally, I think that people who advocate for<br/>\nunlimited TV happen to have families that are not adversely affected by<br/>\nTV.  This is not true of all families.  I know from personal experience<br/>\nthat TV can adversely affect young children.  And yes, I&#39;ve done<br/>\nextensive experiments with both unlimited, limited and no TV at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Put it on and let it stay on for a full year. No, two years. The reason he<br/>\n&gt; cannot limit himself is because you&#39;re limiting him. There is no way for him<br/>\n&gt; to find his natural patterns if you&#39;re there either demanding or cajoling<br/>\n&gt; him away from the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree with this.  This might be true for an adult or older child,<br/>\nbut I haven&#39;t seen it be true for a young child (under age 6).  From<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve seen, a young child is more likely to watch enough TV to make<br/>\nhimself restless and miserable and still never want to shut it off. <br/>\nYes, you need to have freedom to find your natural pattern, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be at age two!

It didn&#39;t make any<br/>\ndifference how much TV I had watched in earlier years. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know many people will strongly disagree with me.  That&#39;s fine.
