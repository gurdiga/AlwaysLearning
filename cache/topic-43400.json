Judy Garland in a movie about surviving a suicide was an interesting thing for all of this to spiral around. It also spurred conversations about alcohol as a depressant and why it was awful for James Mason to keep getting drunk when he was depressed and why he might have kept reaching for the bottle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point Simon said that he has a really good life and he never feels without options. I thought that was a cool thing to hear. Better than A&#39;s on a report card or a good parent-teacher conference. His life isn&#39;t filled with the intensely fearful moments of knowing that you are going to be in trouble for something that you just did or filled with shame and awfulness that I can remember with such vividness that it can spiral me down into horrible negativity and anger just revisiting them. My dad kept some of the mean notes that I wrote to him and my mom when I was little telling them that they were horribly mean parents and that I felt really bad to be their child. They were probably both funny and sad to him and maybe he wanted to give me perspective if my children felt that way. My children don&#39;t feel that way enough to have ever written me a card saying that they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 5 cats, 4 of whom are the offspring of the remaining 1. 1 of the sibling cats is bullied by all of her siblings and her mom and she got really stressed out. She was peeing all over the house and the furniture. David&#39;s first response was to limit her life to that of an outdoor cat, but we have a conservatory that can be closed off from the rest of the house so we set that up for her. During the day everyone of the humans in her life goes and sits with her. She doesn&#39;t get bullied nearly as much by her feline family and she gets to eat when she wants as her food is separate from the rest. Her life is better having her own room and her own place to withdraw to. When she does get into the rest of the house she tends to head back to her room fairly quickly. She likes feeling calm and good and safe and not scared and stressed and bad. It has been fascinating to watch (after dealing with the smell of cat urine on so many pieces of furniture) her deal<br/>\n with this stress in her life. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 30 March, 2009 6:15:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;economic centered&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I have a decent relationship with my family now, but if I am around  <br/>\nthem for too long, I start going back to that place of negativity and  <br/>\ncritical sarcasm, and it&#39;s hard to maintain my happy calm natural  <br/>\n&quot;Polyanna&quot; attitude.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called &quot;joy.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI think it has to do with gratitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far this morning I posted one &quot;Pollyanna&quot; blog post, talked to  <br/>\nMarty, then Kirby called and we had him on speaker phone, but Marty  <br/>\nhad to go to work, and then I talked to Keith about the weather  <br/>\n(getting colder) while I cleaned the hot tub (involves water, in cold  <br/>\nand wind).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I e-mailed Keith, who&#39;s at work on a Monday:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Subject:     hot tub is clean and filling<br/>\nFREEZING out there, but I remembered that under such circumstances,  <br/>\nthe warmest place is crouched down inside that hot tub!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I checked e-mail and found this post about happy and calm!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy and calm is huge.

They assumed he  <br/>\nwould want to learn the menu and be a waiter, but he doesn&#39;t.    <br/>\nRecently a waiter was busted back to bussing tables and he was  <br/>\nfrustrated by that, and embarrassed, and he quit.   Marty, though, has  <br/>\nfound joy in figuring out ways to do his job more artfully and quickly  <br/>\nand quietly and takes pride in all the tables looking beautiful and in  <br/>\ncheering up the waiters and dishwashers and cooks in various ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a Buddhist concept that&#39;s fairly foreign in Western  <br/>\nCivilization, in recent centuries anyway:  Right Livelihood.<br/>\nIt has to do with morals and mental health, and living a good life.    <br/>\nIt has to do with making a living in such a way that other people are  <br/>\nserved and not harmed, and the person acting is not harmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n From his jobs, Marty gets personal satisfaction, enough money to make  <br/>\nhis jeep payments, to entertain his friends, and to put money in  <br/>\nsavings (he still lives at home so rent and utilities aren&#39;t at stake  <br/>\nyet), and he get exercise, exposure to different kinds of people, the  <br/>\nopportunity to learn about things he didn&#39;t even know existed (foods,  <br/>\nequipment, stories people bring in to work).  He gets to be a calming  <br/>\ninfluence and to make his co-worker&#39;s lives better.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps in western civilization, or at least within Christianity, it&#39;s  <br/>\nrelated to a religious life, or &quot;vocation.&quot;  That&#39;s not always being a  <br/>\npriest or a nun or a minister.   And all of those things can be done  <br/>\nfor better reasons and worse reasons.   Unfortunately, our culture  <br/>\ndoes NOT prize and value those who will take less money to have a more  <br/>\nsatisfying life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unfortunate.  Someone who can go home from work without worry or  <br/>\nguilt is way ahead of the game.   Some people have to pay money to go  <br/>\nto the gym to get exercise, and then buy sleeping pills because  <br/>\nthey&#39;re thinking about work instead of sleeping, and then go to a  <br/>\ncounsellor or psychiatrist because their lives and health are being  <br/>\nruined by stress.   They probably don&#39;t have more available income  <br/>\nthan Marty has. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"Krisula Moyer &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;economic centered&quot;","postDate":"1238427052","msgId":43563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0NDYzREE3LTdFQkMtNEExNi05MDE2LUM3MkVBRDI0MDEzQ0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43561,"nextInTopic":43565,"prevInTime":43562,"nextInTime":43564,"topicId":43400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My 5yo son is mentally retarded and<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned a TON from him about taking joy in the moment, in the task at<br/>\nhand. He downright *loves* doing things that I myself used to consider<br/>\nboring chores like unloading the dishwasher, weeding the garden, sweeping<br/>\nthe floor. Stevie takes such pleasure in those jobs, both the ones he can do<br/>\n(like the dishwasher) and the ones I do that he can help with (like whenever<br/>\nI&#39;m sweeping he has the dustpan at the ready), and that happiness has, over<br/>\nthe years, &#39;infected&#39; everyone in the house, so that I think all of us take<br/>\nmore pleasure in those kinds of mundane tasks than we once did. I have found<br/>\nthat I truly LOVE weeding the garden. It&#39;s peaceful and calming. I used to<br/>\nfind it tedious, maybe because I lumped it into a &#39;boring chore&#39; category of<br/>\nactivity and entered the task with my mind already made up about it in a<br/>\nnegative way. Stevie doesn&#39;t saddle the business (busy-ness) of life with<br/>\nthose assumptions; he takes genuine pleasure in being able to DO. &quot;I do it,<br/>\nMom!&quot; is one of his most frequent statements. I&#39;m really grateful for the<br/>\nthings I&#39;ve learned from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is a bit of a leap, but it seems to me to be the same sort of<br/>\nthing--I remember a passage in The Continuum Concept when Jean Liedloff<br/>\ntalks about learning from the example & cheerful attitudes of the Yequana<br/>\nIndian woman she was living with. There&#39;s a bit where she talks about<br/>\nwalking up (or maybe down) a steep hill and feeling the burn in her leg<br/>\nmuscles, and realizing that once upon a time she would have felt negative<br/>\nand complainy about that, the strain, the tired feeling, but it struck her<br/>\nnow that it was a great thing to feel one&#39;s muscles working, performing as<br/>\nthey ought to, and a great thing to be able to climb a hill, and balance,<br/>\nand have a body able to take her where she wanted to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate people like Stevie and Liedloff who cause me to notice<br/>\nthings I take for granted and to question my assumptions, and remind me how<br/>\nmuch joy there is in the daily tasks of life. (Which are also the reasons<br/>\nwhy I read this list, though I hardly ever post.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLissa, mom of six in San Diego<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;economic centered&quot;","postDate":"1238394616","msgId":43559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5RDA2NkY4LjYwMDAzMDJAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxcGU2dCtvdDJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdxcGU2dCtvdDJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43556,"nextInTopic":43561,"prevInTime":43558,"nextInTime":43560,"topicId":43400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s about being a whole person rather than aiming  <br/>\nto be a wealthy person.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with the same eye that I see that, I also see people charging  <br/>\nother unschoolers $35 an hour or whatever for advice.  Some of those  <br/>\ncharging are honestly thoughtful and experienced people.  Some just  <br/>\nwant $35 and don&#39;t really seem to understand unschooling yet themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is one of the big stressors of anyone&#39;s emotional life.  Among  <br/>\nChristian conservative homeschoolers there were many families in which  <br/>\nthe dad quit his regular job to create or sell homeschooling  <br/>\nmaterials, and at that point, could the mom try to talk him out of  <br/>\nhomeschooling?  Much strife was hushed up and covered over about that,  <br/>\nand much of the hostility toward unschoolers is economic.  I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nwinced at and about at conferences at which the fees charged for space  <br/>\nin the vendor room provided more revenue than conference fees, and  <br/>\nthere I was standing at a podium telling people not to buy anything  <br/>\nuntil they understood natural learning--that children could learn from  <br/>\nplaying with sticks and rocks.   (Not exactly those words, but that  <br/>\ngeneral drift, which made vendors desire to criticize me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney isn&#39;t usually discussed, and there have been comments made by  <br/>\npeople assuming (and being all het up about the idea) that I was  <br/>\nmaking big money, speaking and selling books.  Last year I made $800  <br/>\nor so selling books and Thinking Sticks, which I make out of popsicle  <br/>\nsticks.  I ended up spending money on the Arizona conference, which  <br/>\nwas okay because I got to see Kirby and a couple of Sorooshians. &lt;g&gt;    <br/>\nThe money they gave me for transportation and hotel didn&#39;t totally  <br/>\ncover it, but it was fine.   Most often I speak at conferences for  <br/>\nairfare and a room.  Some speakers who know less than I know charge  <br/>\n$1000 and want a rental car and stuff.  So they&#39;re not thrilled with  <br/>\nme taking transportation and a room.  Sometimes I get transportation  <br/>\nfor one of my kids, as well (as I did to get Kirby to Tempe; then he  <br/>\nspoke too, but he wasn&#39;t compensated with his own room, which is also  <br/>\nfine).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m telling this because what I&#39;m doing is not about money.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nabout sharing something that seems magical when it works.  I&#39;m not  <br/>\npromoting ways to get rich, or anything except fun and peace and joy  <br/>\nand learning.   People who don&#39;t want fun and peace and joy and  <br/>\nlearning don&#39;t need to hang around where I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill my kids &quot;be rich&quot;?  I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t care.  All around  <br/>\nme, at every age level, are people who did not meet their parents&#39;  <br/>\nexpectations.   There&#39;s a depth and breadth of shame, sorrow and  <br/>\nbroken families involved in that.   The expectations themselves cannot  <br/>\nbe undone for any amount of money.   I know two adult men whose  <br/>\nparents consider them failures.  One is a doctor with several  <br/>\ndegrees.  One has a PhD.   In both cases, the siblings are medical  <br/>\nspecialists--surgeons or whatever--and the disappointing sibling is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I do not want for my children.  I don&#39;t want to set them  <br/>\nup to feel that they could be a doctor or have a PhD and still be a  <br/>\nbig disappointment to their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people look at that and see only &quot;low expectations,&quot; or &quot;lowering  <br/>\nthe bar.&quot;<br/>\nMy kids are already doing things adults around them can&#39;t or don&#39;t  <br/>\ndo.  I&#39;m not worried at all.  They are whole and thoughtful.  Neither  <br/>\nof those two things comes from a curriculum in ANY school.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quote was from this page, which is more about politics than  <br/>\nunschooling, but people meet where they meet.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningnet-india.org/lni/data/index.php\">http://www.learningnet-india.org/lni/data/index.php</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an international page for this now, too:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.multiworld.org/taleemnet.htm\">http://www.multiworld.org/taleemnet.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43628,"nextTopicId":43620}}
