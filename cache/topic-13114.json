But this morning my kids are occupying themselves and I have a <br/>\nfew precious moments to myself and thought I&#39;d read my email!  And boy, <br/>\nthere is something going on today, huh?  Or at least on that other list <br/>\nSandra attached.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is downright odd that someone would compare raising dogs to raising <br/>\nkids.  However, it just might point out a blanket societal approach to <br/>\nthem.  Might explain a few things I have witnessed time and time again.  <br/>\nYep, SIT OR I AM COMING OVER THERE! I don&#39;t find those jokes funny at <br/>\nall.  Hitting kids, humiliating kids, controlling kids -- none of that <br/>\nis funny to me.  It is sad beyond comprehension.  It is nightmare <br/>\nmaterial to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA woman I know says that she feels OK about being the only person for <br/>\n25,000 miles in any given direction who feels X about X.  (We live in a <br/>\ntiny little conservative town.....)  She says it makes her solidify her <br/>\nthoughts on any given subject.  At first I understood, but I have come <br/>\nto realize that being with other like-minded people is strengthening.  <br/>\nHaving support is not weak. Having support is comfort and being <br/>\noutnumbered or surrounded by &#39;crazy&#39; people can be so isolating!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad to be a member of this list where we share ideas and support <br/>\nfor raising and allowing learning for children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone for being here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13105,"nextTopicId":13113}}
