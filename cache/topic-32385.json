I generally reply with 2nd grade for Dd(8) and for ds(5) I <br/>\njust say pre-K. Even though he is nearly 6, he is not ready for the <br/>\nkindergarten class at church and is much more comfortable in the 4 & <br/>\n5 year old class. Dd should be in the 2nd/3rd grade class at church, <br/>\nbut she is afraid of that class because the new teachers (parent <br/>\nteam) are making a big deal about everyone reading aloud Bible <br/>\nverses. Therefore, she goes into the Kindergarten class as <br/>\na &quot;helper&quot;, which was her idea and she absolutely loves. She loves <br/>\nto tell me how she helped the others with their papers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like everyone wants to put kids into some kind of category, <br/>\nbut frankly, the more I learn about unschooling, the more I just want <br/>\nto say that they are not in a grade level. Of course, that freaks a <br/>\nlot of people out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the rest of you do about &quot;grade&quot; level? Dd excels at <br/>\nanything pertaining to math, but is not a reader yet. So what does <br/>\nthat make her (in the public&#39;s opinion)? A gifted student with a <br/>\nlearning disability? If she were in school, she would probably be in <br/>\nspecial classes for reading, and be working at below her level in <br/>\nmath just to make things easier for her teacher. She doesn&#39;t have <br/>\na &quot;grade&quot; level. She just IS. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am absorbing all I can about the unschooling philosophy.

My other kids - not so much.  <br/>\nEven right now, I&#39;m not sure if Rosie would be in 11th or 12th grade  <br/>\nthis year - I&#39;d have to figure it out. But she&#39;d know, if I asked her.  <br/>\nIt is SUCH a big deal to the other girls on her soccer team,  <br/>\nespecially - they&#39;re always identifying each other and other students  <br/>\nthey know by which grade they&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 25, 2008, at 11:53 AM, Vicki Dennis wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Been a while since my children are all adults now.<br/>\n&gt; But &quot;in the day&quot; we just said &quot;we don&#39;t do grades&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Had a dual meaning because we did not do grade levels nor report  <br/>\n&gt; cards.

I generally reply with 2nd grade for Dd(8) and for ds(5) I <br/>\njust say pre-K.  Even though he is nearly 6, he is not ready for the <br/>\nkindergarten class at church and is much more comfortable in the 4 & <br/>\n5 year old class.  Dd should be in the 2nd/3rd grade class at church, <br/>\nbut she is afraid of that class because the new teachers (parent <br/>\nteam) are making a big deal about everyone reading aloud Bible <br/>\nverses.  Therefore, she goes into the Kindergarten class as <br/>\na &quot;helper&quot;, which was her idea and she absolutely loves.  She loves <br/>\nto tell me how she helped the others with their papers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like everyone wants to put kids into some kind of category, <br/>\nbut frankly, the more I learn about unschooling, the more I just want <br/>\nto say that they are not in a grade level.  Of course, that freaks a <br/>\nlot of people out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the rest of you do about &quot;grade&quot; level?  Dd excels at <br/>\nanything pertaining to math, but is not a reader yet.  So what does <br/>\nthat make her (in the public&#39;s opinion)?  A gifted student with a <br/>\nlearning disability?  If she were in school, she would probably be in <br/>\nspecial classes for reading, and be working at below her level in <br/>\nmath just to make things easier for her teacher.  She doesn&#39;t have <br/>\na &quot;grade&quot; level.  She just IS.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am absorbing all I can about the unschooling philosophy.  It makes <br/>\nso much sense and my children are so much happier and I am so much <br/>\nmore at peace.  This is the first time, since I began homeschooing, <br/>\nthat I feel completely at peace about my &quot;method&quot; of homeschooling my <br/>\nchildren.  We are just loving and enjoying life and all it brings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, my original question:  How do others respond when someone asks <br/>\nwhat grade your child is in?  <br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Dd forgets what level she is supposed to be because it is just <br/>\nnot something we talk about!  When someone asks her, she sometimes <br/>\nlooks confused and I jump in and help her out.
