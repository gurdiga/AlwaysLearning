Unschooling is<br/>\nall about paying attention to their interests and helping them (whether<br/>\nthat&#39;s finding new action figures for them on eBay, helping them build<br/>\nAction Figure Swim World in the back yard with an old rubbermaid bin, taking<br/>\npictures of the action figures doing various action figure things so they<br/>\ncan keep them in a scrapbook, etc.) and also in bringing bits of the world<br/>\nthat you think *they* might find interesting to them (trips to the zoo, or a<br/>\nfactory that makes jelly beans, or videos or books or websites about otters<br/>\nor Pokemon or bananas).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the pursuit of happiness. In that pursuit, learning cannot<br/>\nhelp but happen.
