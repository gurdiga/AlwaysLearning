We are a family of five.. homeschoolers for 10<br/>\nyrs and then unschoolers.. me and the girls more so than my husband, at<br/>\nleast as far as math is concerned. (and I do need suggestions in this<br/>\narea!!) He is ok with everything but this for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m married.. 21 yrs.. we have 3 daughters.. ages 17, 11, and 6yrs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the country..and are a back-to-the-land homesteading kinda<br/>\nfamily. We raise goats for milk, chickens for eggs and my oldest daughter<br/>\nhas 2 Appaloosas..I also have sheep.  I love herbs, gardening, baking bread<br/>\nand whole foods, feeding the birds, and books of course..I&#39;m always<br/>\nreading.. a stay at home kinda person really.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tend to be Libertarians in our political thinking..  not so sure about<br/>\nour Spiritual side anylonger.. once pretty fundamentalist Christian..(I was<br/>\nraised Lutheran, my husband was no specific religion when we married) but<br/>\nafter experiencing some very bad things done to us by &quot;so called<br/>\nChristians&quot;.. we are once more searching. I personally tend to lean to<br/>\nNative American spirituality now.<br/>\n<br/>\nA special &#39;hello&#39; to Sandra.. I&#39;m a big fan of yours.. reading your site..<br/>\nlistening to you on the unschoolers forum..and also your articles in Home<br/>\nEducation magazine. I&#39;m curious about your spiritual journey..raised<br/>\nSoutheran Baptist..but now?? What changed for you? Or maybe none of my<br/>\nbusiness..and that&#39;s ok too.  Hey, I also am interested in the Medieval<br/>\nstuff that you do.. my family and I once went to a festival near OKC and my<br/>\nsister and brother in law used to be very into it.. sounds like SO much<br/>\nfun!! I also love the Civil war re-enactments that are done locally in our<br/>\narea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.. hear it goes..<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1266,"nextTopicId":1271}}
