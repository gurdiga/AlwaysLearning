Meaning that I don&#39;t dress anything like who I am or <br/>\nwhat I like. I dress in what fits and very &quot;mom-like&quot;. Before I had the twins <br/>\nand especially in high school, I was a serious tomboy. I lived at the beach, <br/>\nskateboarded everywhere and if something wasn&#39;t torn, I didn&#39;t wear it. Kass is <br/>\ncritical like me and really questions everything, she dresses nothing like I <br/>\ndid, until I got to college. Kree is a tomboy and dresses exactly like I did in <br/>\nhigh school. Skulls on everything, the bigger and baggier the better. Rather <br/>\nwear boxers than girly undies. The difference is I didn&#39;t get to dress like <br/>\nthat until I was in high school and rebelled (which by the way, was my BIG <br/>\nrebellion). They get to be who they are now. I don&#39;t know if watching them brings <br/>\nme to a place that I loved and now miss about myself, or if it just strikes me <br/>\nas weird, that although they are so different, they are both like me in many <br/>\nways. I wonder often if I got to be the size I was then and I actually dressed <br/>\nthe way I loved, if they would just die of embarrassment at a mom who feels so <br/>\nat home in &quot;Hot Topic&quot;. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140850796,"authorName":"Rebecca DeLong","from":"Rebecca DeLong &lt;elfmama@...&gt;","profile":"elfmama_2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling myself","postDate":"1063728185","msgId":16321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTE2MTYwMzA1Ljg2MjMucW1haWxAd2ViODA0MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTEzLjA2MjE1OS4yNDIzNC4xMzExMTVAd2VibWFpbDE3Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16320,"nextInTopic":16322,"prevInTime":16320,"nextInTime":16322,"topicId":16275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren  wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1803092159\">Ren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;I have managed to get past some of this, but it&#39;s been 26 years of being told <br/>\nhow to be, and it is so at odds with where my heart tells me I need to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh Rebecca, I can so relate to this sentiment.
