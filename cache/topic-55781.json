Once at our Yearly Meeting (what it sounds like--an annual gathering of Quakers from a certain region) we were gathering to take the kids to the lake for the afternoon. One boy snapped another boy with a towel, and his father went off on him, towering over him, screaming into his face: &quot;ANYTHING CAN BE A WEAPON! YOU HAVE TO BE MORE PEACEFUL!&quot; Scared the bejeesus out of every kid in the room. He went on and on until a Friend took him by the arm and led him out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought the idea that anything can be a weapon was a really scary one to plant in a kid&#39;s mind, it was so paranoid. I also thought getting up into a frothing rage and terrifying 20 children over a snapped towel was, as Sandra pointed out up-thread, way more violent than anything those kids were getting up to with their towels and water guns. It was this twisted example of how extreme thinking--in this case, about peace and pacifism--can get all tangled up and lead to the opposite of what you want. In this case, this dad&#39;s commitment to peace in the world was a big part of why he didn&#39;t have peace in his family. Which is heart-breaking because you can help a family be peaceful much more easily than you can bring peace to the world. He was so caught up in an ideal that he gave up the power he had to influence his little corner of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\nmom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, almost 3<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Gun play and other parents","postDate":"1278780854","msgId":55805,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzQjhCODYzLTQ0NUItNEJEMS04NEFFLThCRUNDRjlCM0VBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxOW5vNis4aDAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxOW5vNis4aDAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55804,"nextInTopic":55806,"prevInTime":55804,"nextInTime":55806,"topicId":55781,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- It s not the responsibility of other people to build your son s self- ...

Frog gigging too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was a police officer for a while when we first got married - then he switched to being an EMT (emergency medical tech) and driving an ambulance.  Never has he killed anyone.  His hand gun from when he was an officer is locked away for safety reasons.  I have my dad&#39;s two guns from when he was a teen some day they will belong to Zac.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son who is now 16 has always loved guns / weapons - in the beginning we had a no play/fake gun policy for the first 4 to 5 years - and he always made his own play guns with sticks, legos, fingers, anything!   We even took him out and showed him what a real gun would do because we have guns in the house - we shot oranges and apples - I don&#39;t remember the age but probably 4 or 5.  We were not trying to scare him but to show him the real danger of what a real gun would do.  Our thought was no play guns - only real guns when he gets old enough. ????  ANYWAY around age 4 or 5 we gave up when it was obvious that a no play guns policy was not diminishing his passion.  We gave up when relatives took him shopping for his birthday and they let him pick out what he wanted and of course he came home with an arsenal!!!!  &lt;BWG&gt; He soon had swords, dart guns, squirt guns, cork guns, rubber band guns, pop guns, nerf, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that is to say he is 16 and he and his dad are off playing Airsoft today.  Military simulation airsoft.  They get dressed up in complete outfits and replay tactical events.  There is a lot of history involved too - they do research on the event, etc.  For example last fall they re-enacted the event that the movie &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is based upon .  They ended up going to multiple thrift stores to get the right type of clothing after researching Somoli type dress for those years.  Today they are wearing full military multicam (not allowed to wear current fatigues - just the discarded styles for safety).  Their guns are exact replicas - with orange tips of course. They wear authentic uniforms.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we drove across the state to go to a state park and on the way I was looking at a book about the state and found that there was a really good museum on a military base we would be within an hour drive of (actually 3 museums within one building).  We went to the park, enjoyed the park, got a hotel room for the night and then drove another hour to the base the next day and enjoyed a day of military museums.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZac is also very knowledgable about any aspect of most wars throughout time and the world.   He knows social and economic causes of wars and results of war.  Inventions that were brought about because of wars and how the invention of a particular weapon advanced society, etc.  Yesterday we were at a book store and he found a book on Samuri swords that he bought - he loves anything to do with the Samuri and Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about the killing to him - though a few good explosions in a game or a movie is thrilling to him ;)  We just went to see &quot;The A-Team&quot; and he loved it!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went through a stage for 2 years where he made wooden swords with a piece of wood, a carving knife and some fine grit sand paper.  His best ones hang on his bedroom wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis love of weapons and warfare have led to knowledge and a passion for:<br/>\n<br/>\n   Roman, Greek, Norse mythology.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Knights Templar and other knights, Scotish, Celts, Picts, Saxon, Norman, Brits, Viking, Roman, Mongol, Chinese, Japanese,<br/>\n   European - not so much but a little, Egyptian, USA, etc.     <br/>\n<br/>\n   American history - social and economic as well as wars and weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Carving, flinting, making chain mail, dioramas, making stop motion films, action film making, still life photography, drawing, map making, hand made a Samuri warrior costume for himself and his horse for a Halloween contest/party and won first place, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Various music from various time periods: calssical, bagpipes, Scotish / Irish / Celtic, African drumming, Swing, Big Band, <br/>\n<br/>\n  Movies - and READING :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Martial arts - he took HapKiDo for 5 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on as his web of interests are so inter woven with history and warfare but I&#39;ll end with - our son is one of the most kind and gentle souls.

The purpose is to play with them in a way that you cannot play with a real gun. <br/>\n<br/>\nReal guns are to be respected . . . much as real knives and real cars (also things that can be used to cause injury or death) should be respected. Learning to respect the harm something can cause doesn&#39;t happen by *not* playing with the toy versions of those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has had a toy weapons collection since he was quite young, and it&#39;s invariably something other kids gravitate towards when they&#39;re over. Some of those kids are not allowed toy guns at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has an air pistol and goes to the gun range with my husband from time to time to shoot that pistol and my hubby&#39;s shotgun. The kid is a good shot and proudly brings home the targets each time they go, but my hubby says Andrew loses interest out there pretty quickly. He&#39;s content going only 3 or 4 times a year; the rest of the time he has no interest in the real guns. He has no interest in hunting, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he likes about toy guns is the very fact that *they are toys*!! Toy guns allow him to play in ways that he has no interest whatsoever in replicating in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterest in toy guns, or even in real guns, does not mean that interest will develop into wanting to kill people or animals. My husband, my dad, and my brother all own guns, but all three of them hone their marksmanship skills at target practice, period. They love the history of guns, they love the old (long!) rifles that used to belong to my great-grandpa that now hang in my dad&#39;s study, they love the skill that goes into making a gun, and they love the skill it takes to become a good marksman.
