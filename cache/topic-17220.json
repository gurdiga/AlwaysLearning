I had told him when I first saw him that I was a homeopath and <br/>\nhad been taking homeopathic remedies from the moment I had fallen and <br/>\ninjured my ankle.  His comment implied that he thought homeopathic <br/>\nremedies were some kind of hocus pocus.  I did not bother trying to <br/>\nexplain hundreds of years of medical history to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost MDs have been thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that anything <br/>\noutside of allopathic pill and surgery pushing medicine is hocus <br/>\npocus.  Doesn&#39;t matter that the better part of the rest of the world <br/>\nuses homeopathy extensively.  It doesn&#39;t fit the American consumer <br/>\nand profit-driven medical model so our medical schools and their <br/>\ngraduates are taught that it is worthless.  Worthless to whom?  To <br/>\nthe person with a chronic condition being told that there is no cure <br/>\nand that they will have to use this suppressive cream or pop these <br/>\npalliative pills for the rest of their lives and just live with it?  <br/>\nOr worthless to the big medical monopoly machine that keeps pumping <br/>\nout profit to everyone who totally buys into it, except, of course, <br/>\nthe consumer?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that the British and French and Germans and most of the <br/>\nrest of the world, are stupid.  And they use homeopathy for about 40-<br/>\n60% of their socialized medical care, for everyone.  It is a well-<br/>\nknown fact that the Royal Family of England has long relied on <br/>\nhomeopathic care, almost exclusively.  But here in our capitalistic <br/>\nprofit-driven reality the MDs, who sleep with the hospital <br/>\ncorporations, who sleep with the insurance companies, who sleep with <br/>\nthe pharmaceutical companies, we cannot have easy access to this type <br/>\nof simple, safe, effective healing. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year our FDA bans more homeopathic remedies, the same remedies, <br/>\nby the way, that they declare are nothing more than placebos, or <br/>\nsugar pills.  Duh?  How come they have to ban sugar pills?  If there <br/>\nis nothing in them and they are just fake, why ban specific ones?  Go <br/>\nfigure. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, enough of my rant.  At least I still have a certain amount of <br/>\nfreedom of speech in this country, if not much else these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157212379,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;strandbe@...&gt;","profile":"susanstrandbe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Spreading the word","postDate":"1067939773","msgId":17220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUzQzM0LTBFQUQtMTFEOC04QUQ3LTAwMDM5M0JBMkE4RUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNjc5Mzc3NzAuMTcwNi45MjcyMi5tMTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17224,"prevInTime":17219,"nextInTime":17221,"topicId":17220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1950784133\">&lt;&lt;He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you did, but it sure worked.
