I<br/>\nwas so frustrated. So after getting booted (honestly, I didn&#39;t know to<br/>\nread for awhile before posting, if I had, I would have learned a<br/>\nton...), I mulled over what.the.heck. I was supposed to do now...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;d &quot;hear&quot; Sandra...&quot;just be with your kids...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, but THEN what? How do I.....?  &quot;just play with your kids....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so then I....?  &quot;Just quit asking and DO already!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still didn&#39;t get it. And so I read. And went back and read some<br/>\nmore. And read on different forums, and read more of Joyce&#39;s stuff,<br/>\nand even more links that I hadn&#39;t of Sandra&#39;s....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I realize that by being with the kids today, I still haven&#39;t<br/>\nsolved the &quot;problems&quot; of tomorrow. My &quot;what-ifs&quot; still aren&#39;t answered. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the thing - they don&#39;t need to be! When we get to tomorrow,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll figure it out. When the &quot;if&quot; happens, THEN we&#39;ll meet it head-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the end, I need to be just as confident of my children&#39;s<br/>\nchoices and their leading me as any of you are of your children<br/>\nleading you. I can&#39;t compare my journey to yours and count myself<br/>\nshort. There isn&#39;t an unschooling measuring stick that says I am<br/>\nbehind. That&#39;s just me still trying to use my schooling ideas to feel<br/>\ngood about my parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wish, however, that I could hear these discussions coming from<br/>\nreal lips, because I know that imagined tones are sometimes harsher<br/>\nthan they&#39;re meant to be. Though sometimes I know that many of you are<br/>\njust like my DH and tell it like it is! I&#39;m the gentler kind - I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to tell it like it is, if it will hurt. Sadly, I tend to stand by<br/>\nand watch you fall instead of warning you because I was afraid you&#39;d<br/>\ntake it the wrong way...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m starting to catch on, and though I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever<br/>\nget a tougher skin about me, I think I have realized (through other<br/>\nsources in my life this week as well) that I am the best mom for my<br/>\nkids and I&#39;m trying to let them be the best kids they can be. My<br/>\noldest, thank goodness, is like her dad and isn&#39;t afraid to tell me<br/>\nwhen I&#39;ve messed up!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...thanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39304,"nextTopicId":39249}}
