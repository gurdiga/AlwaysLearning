I&#39;ve had several people on my Facebook friend list<br/>\nwho have never heard of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome were dismissive &quot;outloud&quot; so to speak on my wall, some real life<br/>\nfriends and in particular I am remembering a former test adminstrator.<br/>\nSo you can imagine. Pffft! on both sides. I didn&#39;t try to hard to tell<br/>\nthem like it is. Unschooling is not what they are thinking, and I&#39;m<br/>\nnot motivated by their remarks to change how someone thinks. Since it<br/>\nis my wall, I figure I get to keep posting what I wish without<br/>\nreference to what others think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not motivated to changing my thinking about unschooling for people<br/>\nwho don&#39;t know diddly about it.  &gt; ^.^ &lt;  Oh I like that phrasing too,<br/>\nHelen. It&#39;s kind of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have been very interested and have sent me messages on the side<br/>\nabout it as well as commented about their interest. Some aren&#39;t even<br/>\nparents yet. So that&#39;s nice.
