Sometimes, though, the pump was dry and we&#39;d use the water that we had in the car to drink on the way (it was in a little red colemon water carrier that had two lids you could drink from and a tap, in case you needed the visual. Dad or mom would pour it down the line. I never really understood how it worked but google brought to me the information. When there is air in the line the pump isn&#39;t sealed as well. Maybe, in your analogy, lists like this are priming of a sort.

Some of you might never  have used a hand pump on  <br/>\na well, but if it&#39;s been sitting a while or the well is deep you  <br/>\nmight pump this big long handle down and up several times, and  <br/>\nnothing happens, but finally you hear the water and then it floods  <br/>\nout, more water than you needed.  Then the next pump can be  <br/>\ncontrolled because there&#39;s water in the pipe already, and it takes  <br/>\njust the lightest touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr similarly, siphoning liquid with a short hose, where the beginning  <br/>\nis scary and creepy and doesn&#39;t seem at all like it would work, but  <br/>\nonce it&#39;s flowing, you don&#39;t have to do anything except make sure the  <br/>\nend of the hose is below the level of the weight of the water or  <br/>\nwhatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning and growth are like a limitless reservoir, but we have  <br/>\nfactors in our culture that limit our access or control or faith that  <br/>\nit could even work, or our feeling of ownership of knowledge of  <br/>\ngrowth and learning.  Experts.  Timetables and charts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust in case it would help anyone else to think of it as the flow of  <br/>\nwater but siphons and hand pumps are unfamiliar, here are some  <br/>\npictures (and they&#39;re just interesting anyway):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bisonpumps.com/\">http://www.bisonpumps.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dsmit.com/dwhp.php\">http://www.dsmit.com/dwhp.php</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat second one is very interesting.  The water container is plastic,  <br/>\nbut it&#39;s a traditional pottery design, because it&#39;s in India.  In the  <br/>\nU.S. we have plastic water buckets, but they&#39;re a traditional metal  <br/>\nbucket design.
