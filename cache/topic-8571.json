I don&#39;t know how close to 17 <br/>\nyour neice is but in WA at 17 she can become an emancipated minor (ooo a <br/>\nwhole year early, I know) as long as no one contests it and it doesn&#39;t sound <br/>\nas if her parents would.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that she was interested in going into college too so another <br/>\nthing you might consider is getting her into running start at CBC.  They can <br/>\nstart there through the high schoool if they are Juniors.  The way it works <br/>\nthen is they can graduate college with a AA degree at the time they would be <br/>\ngraduationg High school.  It&#39;s a good program if you can get in.  I had <br/>\nfriends who did it.  It might be worth it to check with a counselor at <br/>\nRichland High.  It&#39;s 2 free years of college (I think you might have to pay <br/>\nfor books).  It sounds like she has the grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course then you&#39;re involving yourself with the Public Schooles but it is <br/>\nan option.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8570,"nextTopicId":8572}}
