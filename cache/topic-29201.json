My girls (I know the youngest<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was 7, the older would have been about 9 at the time) Really enjoyed cutting<br/>\nbrush with a machete when we were cleaning up our yard. &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOur 12 year old son did a scything course and we bought him a beautiful<br/>\nAustrian scythe which is his pride and joy. He cuts grass for our horses and<br/>\nhe is always polishing or peening or sharpening his blade. He can tell you<br/>\nall the reasons why scything is good for body and soul, and also why the<br/>\nAustrian scythe is better than other scythes too.. with huge enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas he cut himself yet? Yes! Ended up at A&E for a few hours to get his<br/>\nthumb fixed up. He can explain in detail what went wrong and what he did and<br/>\nhow it won&#39;t happen again.
