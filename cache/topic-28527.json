Stuffed bookcases. Bookcases stuffed with books, <br/>\neven, as well as stuffed with puzzles and games and videos and just plain stuffed. <br/>\nI love poking through other people&#39;s bookcases - it&#39;s fun for me to see what <br/>\nthey have that I also have, and even more fun to find new things beside old <br/>\nfamiliar things. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s my house. I have a book fetish. It&#39;s sad, really. There are too <br/>\nmany books for them all to be out and displayed in ways that make them <br/>\navailable to everyone living here without having to ask me for help. *I* know what&#39;s <br/>\nin the house and where it is, but except for a few key collections actually in <br/>\nbookcases (still thousands of books) the family hasn&#39;t a clue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you dislike TV a WHOLE LOT MORE than I dislike books. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. I&#39;m inspired to tell a story I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t shared on <br/>\nthese lists before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be very anti video game. In 1981 my parents gave me an <br/>\nIntellivision system as a present for my then 3yo son. Oh man. I played and played and <br/>\nplayed that game. I was obsessed. Well, that convinced me for sure. These things <br/>\nare dangerously addictive. I controlled the time my kid could play the games <br/>\nand I absolutely refused to buy that cool Nintendo system we kept hearing <br/>\nabout. It was too good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there things stayed for a very very long time. Eventually we got <br/>\ncomputers and some computer gaming entered my kids lives, but still, I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>\nhave those video game systems in MY house. Too addictive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1999 my younger son Patrick, then age 7, brought home a Game Boy Color <br/>\nsystem from his best friend&#39;s house. His friend had loaned him the system for the <br/>\nweek because he wanted Patrick to level him up in the game they were <br/>\ncurrently working on. I decided the best response was just to let him play it as much <br/>\nas he wanted, not fight over it, given that the system would only be there for <br/>\na limited time. Well. The game boy sat in my son&#39;s room almost all week <br/>\nunplayed, then the last two days he remembered he&#39;d promised his friend he would <br/>\nplay the game for him so spent a lot of time making up for forgetting it all <br/>\nweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about that a lot. First, the kid was really good at the games with <br/>\nvery restricted access. Why was I withholding from him something he was very <br/>\nskilled at? Second, clearly the games were not addicting for him. He&#39;d had the <br/>\ngame with free access and even knowing he&#39;d be returning it at the end of the <br/>\nweek he&#39;d chosen other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of my kids still living at home received Game Boy Color systems for <br/>\nChristmas that year. (They were then 15, 7 and 7) I have wonderful pictures <br/>\nof the three of them sitting around together playing those games. They played <br/>\nfor many many many days straight. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then we&#39;ve had a video game explosion around here. I bought a Nintendo <br/>\n64 system for the house, and many games. Patrick saved for and bought a used <br/>\nGame Cube system. Sarah saved for and bought a Playstation 2 system. They <br/>\nbought an Xbox system together. I gifted the family with the new Wii system a few <br/>\nmonths ago. They&#39;ve moved on through the Game Boy Advance systems to the <br/>\nNintendo DS. I got my own handheld systems and play with my kids. Patrick found an <br/>\noriginal Nintendo Entertainment System at a rummage sale, boxed, with two <br/>\ncontrollers, the gun controller, and several games, for 5 bucks. That sent him on a <br/>\nquest to collect &quot;vintage&quot; video games, the Nintendo systems and games from <br/>\nbefore he was a player (many from before he was born). We tracked down copies <br/>\nof old text adventure games for the computers, even. (Zork, Hitchhikers Guide <br/>\nto the Universe)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey love video games. They play a lot of them. They save to buy games, trade <br/>\ngames with friends, have video game parties. When they have new games they <br/>\nsometimes play very late into the night. They&#39;re on a first name basis with the <br/>\nstaff at the Game Crazy Store. And yet... the video games, beloved as they <br/>\nare, are just a small part of their very big lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick takes a bike ride every day of the year that there isn&#39;t ice on the <br/>\nstreets. Sarah rides several days a week, usually longer rides to places she <br/>\ncan sketch nature. Patrick is outside many hours every day - now that it&#39;s warm <br/>\nthe block teens are playing kickball in the street some afternoons, or he&#39;s <br/>\noff with his skateboarding pals in the schoolyard :) or at the skatepark, or <br/>\nfishing the lagoon, or up a tree. They read books, watch movies, go to watch <br/>\nShakespeare with a group of friends. Patrick works at learning guitar, engages in <br/>\nlong philosophical discussions, and ponders the mysteries of physics and the <br/>\ncalculus. Sarah sketches, paints, and works on her novel. And they play video <br/>\ngames.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we drove two hours (roadwork! Grrr) into the city so Sarah could have <br/>\nher dance injured hip examined by a specialist. Both Patrick and Sarah have <br/>\nbeen playing the new Pokemon games for DS this week. Patrick brought his DS <br/>\nalong. Sarah brought a book. It was all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI regret the time I spent fearing video games. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\n See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: TV and Video Games","postDate":"1178195520","msgId":28543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxY2tvMCtodnZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYxYmI0aitiaDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28542,"nextInTopic":28546,"prevInTime":28542,"nextInTime":28544,"topicId":28527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... probably dislike TV a little ...

He has a genuine <br/>\npassion for videogames and will play them for hours on end. Sometimes <br/>\nI play, too, but he&#39;s so far ahead of me, if I do sit in, it&#39;s <br/>\nusually to watch him play.

But it isn&#39;t the  <br/>\nbooks that deserve our appreciation. It&#39;s the ability to transport  <br/>\nourselves to different worlds and different times. It&#39;s the ability  <br/>\nto visit Africa and Mars and Hogwarts. It&#39;s the ability to hear the  <br/>\nwords of people who are dead or thousands of miles away or speak a  <br/>\ndifferent language. The printed word is no longer our only access. It  <br/>\nisn&#39;t even the best access.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;not the best&quot; doesn&#39;t mean worthless. &quot;Not the best&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>\neven mean &quot;not as good as&quot;. It just means there are other resources  <br/>\nthat are worthy of appreciation depending on our needs and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy putting books on a pedestal we devalue other resources that are  <br/>\njust as valuable, and, depending on the person or the situation, even  <br/>\nmore valuable. A visual person won&#39;t get as much from a book as a  <br/>\nvideo (or from experiencing it). A subject that&#39;s highly visual like  <br/>\nan erupting volcano, a Shakespeare play ;-), a running cheetah have  <br/>\ntheir essence stripped from them when reduced to words on a page or a  <br/>\nstill picture. In fact it&#39;s down right arrogant for those who learn  <br/>\nwell through reading to disparage visual interpretations of stories  <br/>\nas being &quot;less than&quot;. Visual people (like artists) need to absorb  <br/>\nvisuals as word people (like writers) need to absorb words.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks don&#39;t need to be on a pedestal any more. Nor do they need to be  <br/>\nkicked out of the club. They are part of a tapestry of access to the  <br/>\nworld that includes visiting and TV and videos and CDs and the  <br/>\ninternet and playing and video games and talking and lectures and ...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: TV and Video Games","postDate":"1178158821","msgId":28535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxYmd0NSs3b2JjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYxYmI0aitiaDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28530,"nextInTopic":28541,"prevInTime":28534,"nextInTime":28536,"topicId":28527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s an interesting thing.

Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur daughter excelled throughout 12 years at school in the UK and <br/>\nAustralia. Including three years at a posh private all girls school <br/>\nin London where she excelled amongst the excellent. She graduated <br/>\nfrom high school here in 2002 in the top 1% of students in the <br/>\nAustralian Capital Territory. She&#39;s currently in the final year of a <br/>\nfive year Law degree at the University of Canberra and a degree in <br/>\nForensic Science at the Canberra Institute of Technology that she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen running alongside it for the past three years. She already has a <br/>\nBA that she completed two years ago. She was inspired to take the <br/>\ndegree in Forensic Science by watching CSI on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son went to school for two years before my wife and I took him <br/>\nout in 2002 at his request, since when he&#39;s been at home with me. <br/>\nThe &#39;house rules&#39; that were operational before he went to school have <br/>\ncontinued to apply. He can do whatever he likes. Amongst other <br/>\nthings, what he likes most of all is playing videogames and watching <br/>\nTV. So that&#39;s what he does most of the time. When he was at school, <br/>\nhe spent most of his second year in a remedial reading class. He came <br/>\nout of school hating books and refuses to read them. He hasn&#39;t had a <br/>\nreading lesson since he left school, yet his reading is excellent. <br/>\nHis critical thinking is excellent. Nobody taught him that. He <br/>\nlearned it by osmosis. How far ahead he is of where I was when I was <br/>\nhis age in his understanding of the world he lives in is truly <br/>\nawesome. Playing video games, watching TV and DVDs gives him constant <br/>\naccess to learning opportunities that are denied to children confined <br/>\nto school classrooms for most of their time. His latest interest is <br/>\nCSI.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom of choice is a far deeper - and more important - issue than <br/>\nwhat people appear to be doing on the surface. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome random neural firings. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;indymediaroom&quot; <br/>\n&lt;indymediaroom@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new.
