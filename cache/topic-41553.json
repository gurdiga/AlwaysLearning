It&#39;s been promoted <br/>\na lot. People love Calder&#39;s Circus, which is a miniature reproduction of an actual circus, <br/>\nmade from wire, cork, wood, cloth and other household objects. Calder would perform the <br/>\ncircus for people as his &quot;day job&quot; and the exhibit has videos showing how he performed it, <br/>\nbringing it to life for kids.<br/>\nOne of the things that I love about the Alexander Calder story is something I learned <br/>\nabout him on a PBS American Masters program. Apparently, when he was a child, all <br/>\nCalder wanted to do was play with wire. He loved to make little toys and things with scraps <br/>\nof wire and his mother completely indulged this. I love this story because as a parent, we <br/>\nall know that child who refuses to do what they are supposed to do and is obsessed with <br/>\none seemingly useless endeavor. How aggravating it is to try to bend children to our will <br/>\nand get them to conform to the requirements of society. I love the idea that there is value <br/>\nin the play of children and their obsessions and that, let to flower and grow, we may all be <br/>\nsurprised by what comes out of them.<br/>\nWhy kids will like Calder: The Paris Years<br/>\nCalder exemplifies the mystique of the artist as a child who never grew up. His work is <br/>\nwhimsical, imaginative and fun. Of course, kids will be drawn to the Circus piece, which is <br/>\nbasically a big (beautiful) toy, and watching a grown man play with it is even more fun. But <br/>\nchildren also like Calder&#39;s wire portraits for that same whimsy and imagination. They are <br/>\nchild-like, innocent and puzzling. And of course his mobiles are so popular for children, <br/>\nthey became a nursery staple.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do and talk about:<br/>\nPuzzle over the fact that Calder invented the mobile. Really, something that we have in our <br/>\nrooms at home started out as an art object, invented by an artist? Cool.<br/>\nAfter being inspired by how Alexander Calder uses everyday objects to create new things <br/>\nand his inventiveness Children may be inspired to try their own inventions and creations. <br/>\nBuy a little bit of wire or use other household items to create your own animals, people, <br/>\ncircus or anything you feel inspired to do. Or if you&#39;re not a do-it-yourselfer try a wire art <br/>\nkit, which has everything kids need to make colorful jewelry or other fun stuff from wire.<br/>\nThere&#39;s also an exhibit of Calder&#39;s jewelry at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that might <br/>\nmake a nice counterpoint for a second trip</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41544,"nextTopicId":41462}}
