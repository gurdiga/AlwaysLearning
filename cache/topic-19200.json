I&#39;m sure she&#39;s happy with it or she wouldn&#39;t be where she<br/>\nis. From the glimpses that you gave she knew her own mind and went with her<br/>\nheart. I wish her the best and brightest.:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Scary I know! We have been school free since &#39;96 too. My oldest,<br/>\nMichael, is 18. He started Community College in Sept &#39;03 fulltime. Got his<br/>\ndrivers license in Jan &#39;04. He took a seasonal job for Christmas and<br/>\nValentines day. Now he&#39;s taking a break from school and enjoying his<br/>\nfriends. Most of them are Seniors this year. He is currently battling<br/>\ndepression and the road has been hard for him but I think it&#39;s getting<br/>\nbetter. I&#39;m so thankful we found this lifestyle. This would have been a<br/>\ntotal nightmare if we hadn&#39;t. He keep thing to himself enough as it is.<br/>\nLuckily he does talk to me. His Dad&#39;s another story. Well that&#39;s quite<br/>\nenough from me. Glad to see you here. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n&quot;Do not look back on happiness or dream of it in the future.<br/>\nYou are only sure of today; do not let yourself be cheated out of it.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n-- Henry Ward Beecher, US abolitionist & clergyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\non 4/3/04 7:52 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey Barb!!  Another familiar face here!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yup, Kat&#39;s life has changed so drastically in the last year.  She got her<br/>\n&gt; license Jan of 2003, first job April 2003, engaged in May 2003, moved out<br/>\n&gt; and in with her fiance July 2003, and then tied the knot at a civil<br/>\n&gt; ceremony two weeks ago.  &lt;sigh&gt;  She was ready, but her dad and I were<br/>\n&gt; not.  What is it with these kids?  You raise them to think for themselves,<br/>\n&gt; make their own decisions, and then they really go out into the world and do<br/>\n&gt; just that!!!  Scary!!
