There&#39;s this misconception that people need to understand all of math in order to do it. The reality is they can learn the part they need. My daughter never needed to learn to manipulate fractions to use percents. And yet that&#39;s the order they go in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarpenters are whizzes at manipulating fractions in their heads. Can do a good chunk of the math that gets taught in geometry. But the rest of math isn&#39;t necessary to use those pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason people think all of math is necessary is because of Sputnik ;-) The Russians beat us into space so the was the big push to get kids prepared to be scientists and engineers. To do that, they taught everyone who was able all the math that anyone might need for the sciences. The focus was never on what any individual might need. It was all about a production line that turned out a uniform product ready to feed into the sciences.* The basic idea was to give everyone everything and then they could throw away what they didn&#39;t need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s been done that way so long that people think all of math is necessary in order to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n*[And I don&#39;t mean that image to be negative of schools. The whole point of public education 100 years ago was to raise the general level of education in a population that was largely immigrant and do it cheaply. The goal was getting kids to read, to do basic math, to prepare them to be useful in the workforce. It worked well for that. But the model has persisted. And it&#39;s been called on to educate kids in ways it was never designed to do. Now people believe school is the best way to learn. When in reality it&#39;s a very poor way to learn, goes entirely against how we naturally learn new things, and why it&#39;s so hard for kids to learn there. It&#39;s just cheap! Or was before it was asked to do more than it really ever could.]<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Edutainment","postDate":"1348743975","msgId":69130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0NUQ1NTFBLTEyNDktNDNDNy04NDQzLUE3NTVEMjZERjM3QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3MjY2Q0UzLTM4QUUtNEJENC05NDI5LTAzN0QzMDQzNTc5MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGszdnRnbCs4MnZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjcyNjZDRTMtMzhBRS00QkQ0LTk0MjktMDM3RDMwNDM1NzkxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":69129,"nextInTopic":69131,"prevInTime":69129,"nextInTime":69131,"topicId":69113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Focus less on the end result and more on the process of decision making.-=- Yes.

Talking must have given her brain a workout :-)  One habit that was really helpful for me to break, was talking in terms of &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never.&quot;  Choosing not to use those words allowed me to see more clearly what was really happening.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example...My son isn&#39;t a big book guy.  If I thought reading only happened from being engaged with books, I might say that he shies away from reading.  In truth, Ethan reads a lot.  Just tonight he was enthusiastically reading aloud to me pages of statistics from a game he started playing recently.  There are pages and pages and pages of these statistics, and he must have half of them committed to memory already.  If I didn&#39;t see the value in what he was doing, I would miss all of learning that is happening.  My perception of his strengths would be incomplete.  My evaluation of his weaknesses would simply be wrong.  I might believe he didn&#39;t like reading or math, despite the reality that he was reading and using math for fun every day!<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking the time to notice the challenges your daughter *does* take on might help you see past the ones she isn&#39;t interested in or ready for yet.  It might also help you see what *her* goals are for herself more clearly.  From there, you can really start to be her partner!   Partnering in learning is the coolest part of unschooling for me.

Or &quot;learning through living&quot;. It&#39;s something to think about. Your kids are little. Why did you feel a need to justify their early childhood by giving some kind of lable? You don&#39;t have to answer that, it&#39;s a food-for-thought kind of question.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Gray had an article in Psychology Today about how the study of child psychology has become the study of educational psychology. It has become common practice to conceptualize childhood in terms of education. The looser and looser use of &quot;unschooling&quot; is part of that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; is there room in the unschooling philosophy for an end-goala vision of a basic education/set of values that can be worked toward as a part of &quot;living through learning&quot;?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I imagine I&#39;m still asking the wrong question.  Is anyone else feeling as frustrated as I am right now?)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re asking very normal &quot;new to unschooling sorts of questions! That&#39;s okay! In a sense, they&#39;re always the &quot;wrong&quot; questions because they&#39;re starting from outside unschooling - but there&#39;s nowhere else to start ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re starting by looking at goals - your goals for your kids. That&#39;s not terrible in and of itself but those goals have been defined by an educational process you&#39;re not very happy with. Take a break from looking at those goals and look at learning itself: what is it? how does it work? Look at the ways adults learn - not how they learn in colleges and technical schools but how they learn at home, with friends, with their hobbies, on the job. How do 20 year olds learn to be 30? How do men and women learn to be parents? <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is so natural and so very, very personal that trying to set &quot;learning goals&quot; for another person is a bit bonkers. Try to imagine doing that for another adult and that makes sense. Where people tend to get bogged down applying that idea to kids comes from a deep-seated belief or concern that children can&#39;t or won&#39;t learn the &quot;right&quot; things unless they are taught. The trouble is, teaching doesn&#39;t have a very consistent track record! The &quot;good&quot; kids learn what they&#39;re supposed to learn and the &quot;bad&quot; ones don&#39;t (at least not easily)- because learning isn&#39;t about teaching. A whole lot of the time, it&#39;s a side effect of living. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that sense, your daughter is &quot;bad&quot; - she&#39;s not agreeing to learn what you want to teach. Congratulations! You&#39;ll have a much easier time unschooling, if that&#39;s what you choose to do, than if you had a &quot;good&quot; kid. Really, you&#39;re daughter will make a good check on you - she&#39;ll let you know when you&#39;re too busy looking at your own agendas instead of at who she is and what she finds wonderful. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo start there: what does she find wonderful? I suspect part of the problem you&#39;re having is you don&#39;t really know - you&#39;re looking in the wrong directions: at your goals rather than at who she is right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I continue to provide interesting outings, interactions, toys, books, ideas, discussions, free time, etc. on a daily basis hoping that something will strike her fancy and she&#39;ll be interested and we can go from there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nYup, that&#39;s where you&#39;re getting stuck - you&#39;re imagining &quot;interest&quot; will look a certain way. Interest in &quot;learning&quot;. Step back from that. Interest looks like a child having fun. What&#39;s fun for her? What does she enjoy? Not &quot;what does she enjoy learning about?&quot; but what does she actually like to do? Play with dolls? Run around in the sprinkler? Watch Spongebob? Jump on the bed? Talking to you or a friend? Those are interests -  real interests that real little kids have while living life. And! while they&#39;re doing those things they are learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d like her to be able to &quot;think like a scientist&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does that mean? Especially when you consider how many scientists are quoted as saying good science comes from thinking like children! Do you mean you want her to go on being curious about the world? Then feed her curiosity without overwhelming her with more than she wants. When she says &quot;look mommy!&quot; stop and look - be curious too. Offer her new and interesting things, but don&#39;t push them on her - nothing kills curiosity like pushing. <br/>\n<br/>\n Do you want her to ask lots of questions? Ahhh, now, that&#39;s a problem - because some kids don&#39;t ask. My daughter, for instance, isn&#39;t a questioner, she&#39;s a theorist. She jumps right to &quot;that happens because&quot;. And then later she&#39;ll revise that theory to suit new data. Asking questions and posing theories are both aspects of scientific discovery - which a person starts with has more to do with personality than anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;d like her to be comfortable with the language of math<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which math? I&#39;ve done a number of different things over the years and needed a different &quot;language of math&quot; for each. I don&#39;t need to consider surface area to volume ratios in my current profession. In my last, I didn&#39;t need to worry about seam allowances, the turn of the cloth, or correcting for stretch. My partner also works with math and doesn&#39;t need to know any of those things - and I can barely understand him when he starts talking about fret spacing and scales and I don&#39;t know what all. Neither of us learned the math we&#39;ve used in real life in schools - we learned it through hobbies and on the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling kids learn about math in ways which are often surprising to adults because they don&#39;t look anything like learning math. They learn by figuring things out and by doing things. Sometimes it&#39;s really obvious, like when my daughter says &quot;I&#39;m looking for a 2x3 lego&quot; - oh, hey, she&#39;s learning about arrays! Sometimes it&#39;s less obvious like when she divides something into quarters in her head and I&#39;m left wondering how she learned to do that (well, it&#39;s half of a half, mom &lt;eye roll&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Above all, I want her to enjoy learning and to see it as part of a fulfilling life<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for that to work, you need a better grasp on what learning is. Right now your biggest problem is you have a very incomplete picture of &quot;learning&quot; in your head. Here&#39;s a nice place to start getting a bigger, more complete picture:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/connections/\">http://sandradodd.com/connections/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRead that, follow some of the links, spend some time learning about learning. Not too much time, because you&#39;re a busy mom, right? ;) Read a little and then go hang out with your kids and relax into the learning that&#39;s going on around you. You may have a hard time seeing it all at first, that&#39;s okay. You&#39;re learning too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But part of her is that she shies away from challenges, responsibilities, and hard work.  She always has.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a little kid. It&#39;s Okay if she doesn&#39;t climb Mt Everest this weekend ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent people learn in different ways. One of the ways some people build confidence in their skills is by sticking with what they know until they&#39;re confident enough to try something new. Others leap into new things and struggle along, maybe giving up half-way, maybe pushing through. In addition, it&#39;s common for people to learn different things in different ways - so some people will be very conservative trying new things in some areas and launch into new endeavors happily in others. For instance, I don&#39;t like challenges involving my car - no, no, no. But give me a challenge involving fabric and I&#39;ll work my tail off learning something new. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I know from many experiences that if she is given a push, she can work through the discomfort and come out the other side very proud and successful.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people like to be coaxed or nudged. But even people who like to be coaxed don&#39;t Always like to be coaxed - it&#39;s a situational sort of thing. Pushing can feel like bullying - or hazing. People go along with hazing because it feels so good to get to the other side and then turn around and haze the next newcomer, having learned it&#39;s a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; We go about our daily lives as a family and the children learn about the world around them as they go.  We try to provide exposure to many different activities, places, people, ideas, and things.  We provide open-ended toys and supplies, books of all sorts, educational items, and lots of free time.  We do puzzles together, pretend play together, cook dinner together, go to the gas station together<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your daughter enjoy those things? keep doing them! If she&#39;s getting bored, she may be ready for something new. That&#39;s a common phase around age 6 or 7, kids are outgrowing &quot;little kid stuff&quot; and want something bigger and more, but aren&#39;t sure what and don&#39;t want to be overwhelmed. If you throw out examples of things your daughter enjoys, people can help you brainstorm - or if you&#39;re on facebook, there&#39;s a page for getting exactly those kinds of ideas called &quot;My Unschooler is Interested in...&quot; (just list one or two things, though, it&#39;s an idea page, not a bragging page!)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!\">http://www.facebook.com/#!</a>/groups/383815885025681/<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336246301,"authorName":"CarenKH","from":"&quot;CarenKH&quot; &lt;dharmamama1@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Edutainment","postDate":"1348696405","msgId":69122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGszdnRnbCs4MnZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGszdm1mNisyZ2ozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69121,"nextInTopic":69123,"prevInTime":69121,"nextInTime":69123,"topicId":69113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=-= I listed some of her personality traits not as derogatory descriptors, but as practical realities.

I hoped a gentle push could relieve the boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those aren&#39;t the only choices. A better choice for unschooling is *trusting* the living that you&#39;ve been doing -- &quot;interesting outings, interactions, toys, books, ideas, discussions, free time&quot; -- *without* looking for a way to &quot;go from there&quot;. Look instead for engagement. Engagement indicates she experiencing something that&#39;s connecting dots for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you enjoyed making souffl�s and your husband had been waiting and watching for an interest in you that he could &quot;go from there&quot; with, how would that feel? Wouldn&#39;t it feel like he had some agenda to improve you? That he didn&#39;t really care that you were enjoying your souffl�s. What he wanted from you was progress, to show him that you were improving in a way that he could see and appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people don&#39;t like feeling like other people&#39;s improvement projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I listed some of her personality traits not as derogatory descriptors<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you read the list of traits about someone else&#39;s child, you would have seen them clearly as negative. And that&#39;s something you&#39;ll need to work on to allow unschooling to flow: that you can write out a big long list of negative traits and call them &quot;practical realities.&quot; &quot;Practically&quot; speaking a half filled cup is both half empty and half full and yet it makes a huge difference in how someone approaches life which half they focus on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can reframe what you wrote in positive terms, you&#39;ll not only be a step closer to unschooling but a step closer to an even better relationship with your daughter. Positive doesn&#39;t mean easy! Positive won&#39;t change who she is, but it will change how you see her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf full? Or half empty?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  is there room in the unschooling philosophy for an end-goal�a vision of a basic education/set of values that can be worked toward as a part of &quot;living through learning&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not in the way you&#39;re asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you want from unschooling -- &quot;thinking like a scientist&quot;, reading, understanding the language of math -- *does* come -- more or less depending on a child&#39;s natural inclination -- by living a rich, full life being supported in exploring interests, by you being engaged with her explorations, by being her sounding board and asking questions because you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s getting in your way is not having seen this happen. Most people are only familiar with kids who are force fed learning and kids who avoid learning (to recover from the force feeding.) It&#39;s not much to base trusting that kids will learn what they need without being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will help is reading about unschooled kids. Going to conferences. Those of us with now grow unschoolers had to take the end result &quot;on faith&quot; ;-) But now there are lots of grown unschoolers who have shown that they do learn how to weigh what they know and understand to make decisions, do absorb how math works by using it to help them make decisions, do learn to read by living rich, supported lives of exploration. They go to college. They hold jobs. They get up on time and act responsibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t work well when Mom has an agenda for the child that isn&#39;t the child&#39;s agenda or isn&#39;t part of what will happen naturally. It&#39;s okay to have an &quot;agenda&quot; that an unschooling child will learn to read, be able to say please and thank you, be able to wipe her own butt, be able to calculate a tip by 18 ;-) But expecting a child to demonstrate a particular type of learning that isn&#39;t part of who she is when mom gets worried will get in the way of unschooling. The child will feel it as the mom not being happy with who she is, wanting her to be a different child. Just as you would feel if your husband&#39;s expectations of you didn&#39;t match your own expectations for yourself. It would feel like he was trying to mold you into his ideal wife rather than loving the person he married.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At this point I would ask that you please let me know how my &quot;learning through living&quot; differs from your &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It differs because she turned 6! -- the magical school age -- and then you didn&#39;t trust it any longer to get her what she needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s why many unschoolers will insist that unschooling can&#39;t be happening until a child would be in school. It&#39;s easy for parents to see how kids can live up to 5 without being taught what they &quot;need&quot;. There&#39;s loads of examples of kids doing exactly that all around us. But once 1st grade starts and the pressure is all around that the stuff they &quot;need&quot; is hard to learn and must be pushed in starting as early as possible *THAT&#39;S* what separates the &quot;we&#39;ve been doing this since birth!&quot; folks from the unschooling folks. You trusted it for 0-5. But you lost confidence that it would work beyond 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Edutainment","postDate":"1348691221","msgId":69120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0RDBBRTBBLTlCODktNDk3Mi04NzdBLTcyQjlGNjYxRjdFNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGszdm1mNisyZ2ozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGszdm1mNisyZ2ozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69119,"nextInTopic":69121,"prevInTime":69119,"nextInTime":69121,"topicId":69113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-(Am I still misunderstanding every concept in a completely offensive way?)-=- Maybe not every concept, but you do seem to be trying to backpedal and assure","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-75838021\">-=-(Am I still misunderstanding every concept in a completely offensive way?)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe not every concept, but you do seem to be trying to backpedal and assure us that you don&#39;t really need to know what we know.

Being new to unschooling and not fully understanding it, I should not have presumed to use that term.  I should have used the phrase &quot;learning through living&quot; which is what I called our early education philosophy before I had heard of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Learning through living&quot; for us means just that.  We go about our daily lives as a family and the children learn about the world around them as they go.  We try to provide exposure to many different activities, places, people, ideas, and things.  We provide open-ended toys and supplies, books of all sorts, educational items, and lots of free time.  We do puzzles together, pretend play together, cook dinner together, go to the gas station togetherand through all that my oldest (6 yearsthe others are 2 years and 8 months) picked up letters, numbers, counting, colors, walking, using the toiletshe became a well adjusted, age-appropriate, social, happy, experienced and knowledgeable 5 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n(At this point I would ask that you please let me know how my &quot;learning through living&quot; differs from your &quot;unschooling&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit to feeling societal pressure for formal schooling.  When she was 5 I tried a few formal lessons.  These took 10 minutes or less per day and were meant to be fun, yet structured (games and books mostlyno worksheets).  She didn&#39;t seem to like it.  So I made them more fun, yet still structured.  She tired of it.  More and more fun has been applied and I now feel burned out by it.  Besides that, I don&#39;t care for the approach.  It bothers me that I&#39;m trying to force her (however fun it&#39;s supposed to be) to learn something that is uninteresting to her simply because it&#39;s the next lesson in the book.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want something different.  And I don&#39;t mean school at home.  In fact, I don&#39;t at all care for that and I realize that she doesn&#39;t respond to it anyway.  I&#39;d like something informal--learning through living as we have been for years--but with a certain end-goal in mind.  For example, I&#39;d like her to be able to &quot;think like a scientist&quot;, but I don&#39;t need her to memorize scientific knowledge on an arbitrary timeline.  I&#39;d like her to be comfortable with the language of math, but I don&#39;t need her to complete a calculus course by the time she&#39;s 16.  I&#39;d like her to eventually be able to read well, but I don&#39;t need her to do it before the end of &quot;first grade&quot;.  Above all, I want her to enjoy learning and to see it as part of a fulfilling life, not some boring thing that must be done to please someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original question was &quot;can unschooling work for my child?&quot; and the answer was yesthank you, I get it, it can work for every kid.  I also see that I need to ask if unschooling can work for meand I can only answer that once I truly understand unschooling, which apparently I don&#39;t.  So I&#39;ll ask a different question: is there room in the unschooling philosophy for an end-goala vision of a basic education/set of values that can be worked toward as a part of &quot;living through learning&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I imagine I&#39;m still asking the wrong question.  Is anyone else feeling as frustrated as I am right now?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI listed some of her personality traits not as derogatory descriptors, but as practical realities.  I love her, she has many awesome strengths, I enjoy spending time with her, I respect her and accept her for who she is.  But part of her is that she shies away from challenges, responsibilities, and hard work.  She always has.  I know from many experiences that if she is given a push, she can work through the discomfort and come out the other side very proud and successful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I&#39;ve been feeling kind ofstuckwith my daughter because in &quot;learning through living&quot; she has become bored and stagnant when left to her own devices.  I hoped a gentle push could relieve the boredom.  The push I&#39;ve been giving is in trying to make &quot;introducing certain things through living&quot; super fun, but that&#39;s not working.  Leaving her to her own boredom feels like abandoning her.  I continue to provide interesting outings, interactions, toys, books, ideas, discussions, free time, etc. on a daily basis hoping that something will strike her fancy and she&#39;ll be interested and we can go from there, but that&#39;s not happening.  I&#39;m not sure what to do, and I don&#39;t feel I have a clear picture of what model I want to seek advice from  <br/>\n<br/>\n(Am I still misunderstanding every concept in a completely offensive way?)<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Edutainment","postDate":"1348681035","msgId":69118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGQ0ZCMTc4LTJGOTQtNDA0Ny1CQzFBLTMwMkNCRTgxNUNCRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMyRDIwQjk1LUE0NDEtNEYxRS1BMTU2LUIzMEI3QUQ5RkExMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGszdjI3aStnazQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MzJEMjBCOTUtQTQ0MS00RjFFLUExNTYtQjMwQjdBRDlGQTEyQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":69116,"nextInTopic":69119,"prevInTime":69117,"nextInTime":69119,"topicId":69113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-* She s 6.

It is also fundamental to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you can take a break from trying to educate her and start to try to get to know and appreciate her as she is.  At the moment you&#39;re seeing the things about her that frustrate you because you&#39;re focussed on outcomes that are of little or no interest to her.  And she has enough spark in her not to simply comply with your wishes.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to spend lots of time with her on her terms, genuinely supporting her in her plans and desires and ideas, you would be getting closer to unschooling.  And you would be helping her to grow and learn in the ways that are most meaningful to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t require children to be of any particular type.  Fundamental to the philosophy, is that children are accepted for who they are.  Parents support them in their explorations of the world and embrace their unique ways of living and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is quite a different approach from what you&#39;re used to, so start with stepping back from trying to educate her.   At the same time, notice more the things she&#39;s interested in and how she explores them.  She is trying to learn about the world and it would help her to have your support in her endeavours.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 27/09/2012, at 12:07 AM, mvm34534 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My daughter is 6.

Unschooling won&#39;t help you &quot;fix&quot; her into that ideal child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it can be, if you embrace it, is a way to love and appreciate who the child is that you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can start right now by shifting your view.<br/>\n<br/>\n* She&#39;s someone who has strong opinions. This is a great characteristic for leaders. Such kids can be helped -- AS THEY&#39;RE DEVELOPMENTALLY ABLE -- to be open to others and their ideas. The best way you can help her is by being open to her ideas, by working your own needs in when you&#39;re meeting her needs, by working others needs in when you&#39;re meeting her needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n* She&#39;s 6. There&#39;s a reason people aren&#39;t allowed to sign contracts until they&#39;re 18. She *shouldn&#39;t* be expected to &quot;take responsibility.&quot; You should trust that she&#39;s still figuring out how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by &quot;responsibility&quot; you mean she does damaging things and doesn&#39;t seem to care, if you can give us examples, people here can help you see more clearly what&#39;s going on. It might be age. It might be a response to your attitude towards her. It might be the result of many little things that have built up. Whatever it is, it&#39;s something that makes sense to her in order to protect herself. If so, the deal then would be to find what she feels she needs to protect herself from and get that out of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n* She is someone who is grazing right now. She wants to skim the surface to gather a bit about everything. She may get deeper when she&#39;s older. Or she may always enjoy knowing a little about everything. That&#39;s how her brain makes sense of the world. If you can only respond to certain types of brains, rather than being able to feed what your unique child is reaching for in the way she&#39;s reaching for it, unschooling will be very difficult for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n* She&#39;s someone who enjoys sharing the experience of discovery with others. For her it&#39;s a social activity. At 6 she realizes you have way more ideas about the world, can show her way more than she can discover on her own with the much lesser skills she has right now. *Right now* doing is far more engaging for her than searching and exploring blindly. As she grows, as her exploring skills grow, that will change, but it&#39;s probable she&#39;ll always enjoy doing some or most things with someone else rather than on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n* She&#39;s someone who enjoys learning in ways that are different from what they must limit themselves to in school in order for 1 teacher to pour the exact same information into 30 kids at a time. It&#39;s actually surprising that anyone survives it, let alone likes it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can see her for the wonder that she is, if you can embrace her exactly as she is, then you&#39;ll be able to create an environment that supports her exploring what interests her. If you can&#39;t, you&#39;ll be less likely to damage your relationship if you put her in school so at least you aren&#39;t the one pushing her to be someone other than who she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":526735221,"authorName":"haydee deldenovese","from":"haydee deldenovese &lt;shybarbie22@...&gt;","profile":"shybarbie22","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Edutainment","postDate":"1348672557","msgId":69115,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRlpqNytTRHNuNDBjNkI0OEdIZE03ZEpaUHA3NWdLSmFnZ1NkSl9oQVpER0VtYngtZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69114,"nextInTopic":69116,"prevInTime":69114,"nextInTime":69116,"topicId":69113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It feels like you have described my daughter, so it will be very interesting to read the others comments...
