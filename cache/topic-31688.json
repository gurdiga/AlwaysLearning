In and around Newcastle,when we lived in Sedgefield, near Stockton -on-Tees bullying or SEN were the main reasons for Home-educating. Not folks who were walking away from schooling, but folks for whom the school environment was not a welcoming experience. In Norfolk, where we live now, there are more people who are actively choosing not to put their children in school than who are choosing to remove them from school because of difficulties. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe drive near Nottingham occasionally on our drive oop nort to see friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ---- <br/>\nFrom: Anthony Aduhene &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anthony@...\">anthony@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 6 January, 2008 9:00:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Hello and introduction<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Sarah,<br/>\njust wanted to say hi as my husband is from West Sussex (Worthing).

She wasn&#39;t taking them to<br/>\nfulfill college requirements or anything like that. She took voice classes<br/>\nand ceramics classes and photography and so on. We used them in the same way<br/>\nothers went to a dance studio or karate studio, etc. Not as &quot;going to<br/>\ncollege.&quot; As she got up into usual college age, maybe 19 or 20, she decided<br/>\nshe wanted to get a degree and only then did she even look at what the<br/>\nrequirements were.Again, I recommend, &quot;The Uncollege Alternative,&quot;<br/>\nespecially as inspiration for those who feel uncomfortable about not being<br/>\non some sort of college-prep path.

He does a couple of mornings at a Steiner Kindergarden at the moment and I am trying to get back into a little working from home for myself.  I managed to push homeschooling/unschooling to the back of my mind but it&#39;s come up again even bigger!<br/>\n <br/>\nI am working on living magically, trusting that the money will manifest that we require.
