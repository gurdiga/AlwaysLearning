Doing things for my family, friends, neighbours, plants, animals, strangers, even people that I&#39;m not fond of. Sometimes big things, but most often lots and lots and lots of little things - a smile, a kind word, some encouragement, a friendly gesture, sharing a helpful link, listening to someone&#39;s troubles, sharing a funny story or an inspiring one, etc. I notice that it is infectious and that the person I shared a kindness with often does something to light up another person.

I&#39;m still trying to get unschooling (in my <br/>\nmind) and apply it, but even the small changes that I&#39;ve made have brought so <br/>\nmuch more happiness to our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we took our children to an indoor waterpark, which we have done many <br/>\nother times. We always go on the Lazy river and I have always used my strength <br/>\nand what I want (or don&#39;t want) to avoid the buckets of water that fall and the <br/>\nwaterfalls. It just didn&#39;t appeal to me. However, I&#39;ve been making a choice to <br/>\nsay yes more often to my children. So as my daughter directed our float to the <br/>\ndumping water I did not do anything to change that direction. Oh the joy on her <br/>\nface and the laughter we both shared when that water was dumped on my head. I <br/>\nwish I had a picture of her face at that moment. We did go around the river a <br/>\ncouple more times and she did not direct us to the waterfalls anymore, I would <br/>\nguess because she knows I usually avoid them. As we got out and were heading to <br/>\na slide she hugged me and told me that she loved me and that I was the best mom. <br/>\nShe said that she hopes that she grows up to be just like me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have a long way to go but I&#39;m so glad to see things in a different <br/>\nlight.

You must  <br/>\ncultivate your mind if you wish to achieve enduring happiness.  You  <br/>\nmust furnish your mind with interesting thoughts and ideas.  For an  <br/>\nempty mind seeks pleasure as a substitute for happiness. &quot;      W.L.  <br/>\nPhelps<br/>\n<br/>\nI had saved this quote, years ago.  I went to look up this Phelps; he  <br/>\nwas a literature professor at Yale, among other things.<br/>\nI like the quote because it connects and sorts out lots of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I found it hoping to share it with some people tomorrow  <br/>\n(not unschooling related), and noticed the &quot;pond&quot; and &quot;springs&quot;  <br/>\nterms, so it reminded me of my talk on &quot;Flow&quot; at a recent conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s something alive and lively about happiness and learning and  <br/>\nthought.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is the difference between watching TV with a happy mind  <br/>\nfull of interesting thoughts and ideas, and watching TV with an empty  <br/>\nmind, dependant on external things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is the difference between kids who walk around at night  <br/>\nand break bottles and spray graffiti, and those who could afford  <br/>\nbottles and spray paint, but have other better things to do at night  <br/>\n(even if it&#39;s watching TV).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night on Wife Swap (which Holly and I watched together), there  <br/>\nwere two families.  Neither fit the definition above of happiness.   <br/>\nNo member of either family fit that.  Their happiness was all  <br/>\ndependant on external things.  One family was too controlling and  <br/>\nshaming, and the other was too loose and scattered, but in neither  <br/>\nwas there cultivation of mind, nor any emphasis on interesting  <br/>\nthoughts and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the New York Times article and the UPI shorter report on that that  <br/>\nfollowed ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschooling.blogspot.com\">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a> ), the objections to  <br/>\nunschooling seem based on the assumption that happiness is dependant  <br/>\non external things, and our children can&#39;t be happy because they  <br/>\nwon&#39;t have those externals--school friends, quick college degrees and  <br/>\nthe money that *might* follow... whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the filling of a family with the happiness that springs from  <br/>\ninward thoughts and emotions, maybe the sharing of ideas through  <br/>\nwords, music, images, stories, is part of what creates an unschooling  <br/>\nnest.  Maybe what makes unschooling work well is a cultivation of  <br/>\nmind, and the sharing of minds, in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68517,"nextTopicId":68550}}
