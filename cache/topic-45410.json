I&#39;ve never one single time heard <br/>\nher complain about her parents being controlling. We&#39;ve spent <br/>\nconsiderable time together, traveled together, and she doesn&#39;t even seem <br/>\nto notice that we have a very different kind of relationship. She just <br/>\nmerrily goes about her life, within the very clear and strict boundaries <br/>\nset up by her mother. She&#39;ll be going offf to college, away from home, <br/>\nnext year, but I really think she&#39;ll take all her mother&#39;s controls with <br/>\nher. I don&#39;t think she will go crazy with the sudden freedom, I think <br/>\nshe&#39;s incorporated all the limits and will mostly stick with them. She <br/>\nmight overeat a little, without her mom to tell her when to stop, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s about it. And she&#39;s happy and she likes her parents. So - does <br/>\nthat contradict everything we ever talk about here?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve often said that coercion results resistance or apathy - kids resist <br/>\neither actively or passively, or they give up and &quot;don&#39;t care&quot; about <br/>\ntheir parents, they may not fight them, but they disconnect from them. <br/>\nActive resistance means open conflict arises between parents and kids <br/>\nand passive resistance means sneakiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it isn&#39;t always true. Some kids totally accept the parental control <br/>\nand internalize it.  That situation fascinates me - I think it is a <br/>\nparticular combination of genetics and compatible personalities plus a <br/>\nkid who has a sort of &quot;if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em&quot; attitude. Also, <br/>\nthere is an element of the kid being so controlled that they really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know there is any other alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: good advice and bad advice","postDate":"1243185601","msgId":45503,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2YnZrMSs2MjNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwMzAwQjZBLTVCNjctNENFMy05Rjk0LTNGOTg3MzA5RDAzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45494,"nextInTopic":45505,"prevInTime":45502,"nextInTime":45504,"topicId":45410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... he won t seek his bed until his his ... mandate a family quiet time  ...

If there is one thing that unschooling requires without a doubt, it would be flexibility.

Yet even easier and much less complicated <br/>\nis to make changes that come from happiness and are totally <br/>\nnon-punitive.  Punishment is a LOT of hard work, hard on people, hard <br/>\non relationships, hard on survival rates and safety, high on risk and <br/>\ndeath and chaos.  Considering what I&#39;m doing is guilt-free living, and <br/>\nthus more sustainable than doing and justifying things I don&#39;t fully <br/>\nunderstand the effect of.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while, changing what I do and think becomes natural, less to <br/>\nthink about and more to act on.   Certain things I used to feel dubious <br/>\nabout are now no-brainers: treat children (and others) kindly and <br/>\nwisely, and what I get back will more likely reflect the same toward <br/>\nme.  And actually it has a ricocheting effect.  Even people who haven&#39;t <br/>\nseen me much lately tell me I&#39;m different.  They notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love unschooling principles for clarifying what I truly believe about <br/>\nliving and my own faith really.  Shedding whatever is causing me grief <br/>\nand guilt just works better than finding who&#39;s to blame and juggling my <br/>\nthoughts in a gadzillion conflicting ways.  I don&#39;t spend so much time <br/>\nimagining the kind of mother I&#39;d be without unschooling principles.  I <br/>\nused to feel much more frightened that I wouldn&#39;t be able to get <br/>\nunschooling.  When I do reflect on the horror of where I was headed <br/>\nit&#39;s wonderful that my own real life is lovely by contrast.  Some <br/>\nthings change slowly and it&#39;s hard to be patient.  Yet I&#39;m growing more <br/>\naware everyday and I keep changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this is easier on my heart *and* my mind.  At first, new thoughts <br/>\nwere disturbing and so difficult.  Coming to unschooling lists, as I <br/>\nhave been for several years now, and entertaining new thoughts has <br/>\ngotten easier.  I&#39;ve been able to take them in stride and flow with <br/>\nthem until experience reveals the truth of my actions and brings good <br/>\nto the surface right where my family can enjoy it.  Good is no longer <br/>\nrelegated to the future or put in someone else&#39;s hands.  I don&#39;t feel <br/>\nhelpless or hopeless like I used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of all is the freedom!  The freedom is in realizing the <br/>\nmany many options I couldn&#39;t see once upon a time, long ago and far <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were other great beginnings.  Yet in so many ways, unschooling <br/>\nwas the first day I started living.<br/>\n<br/>\nParaphrase of Neverending Story quote:  And the more wishes you make, <br/>\nthe more magnificent [your life] will become.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] good advice and bad advice","postDate":"1243004928","msgId":45455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBQTdCMUI2LTk0MjMtNERDMS1CN0QwLUEwMzg4NURCQjc2Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwNzEzQkVCRkRERjQxNUM4RkNFNTVEREVBN0FCQjI5QFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDUxMDdFNUU4LThCRjItNDFFMy1CNDZELTk3OEJGMzFDNjkwOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDRBMTVDOUJELjAwMDAxMy4xMjIwOEBNT1JHQU4tQzc0NzNFQzM+IDw3QkIzQkM4Mi0xREU3LTRGREItQjk5MC00NUNERjQ4RDBDM0VAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwzMDMwMEI2QS01QjY3LTRDRTMtOUY5NC0zRjk4NzMwOUQwM0ZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw3OTc5MS43ODgwMy5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw1NURBOTAyMzNENjE0NjQ5QTIyMENFRjExNjJFOEIyM0BSb2NrZXRTYXVjZTI+IDwxMjcwMTkuNTY5MzYucW1Ad2ViODE1MDEubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiA8NjA3MTNCRUJGRERGNDE1QzhGQ0U1NURERUE3QUJCMjlAUm9ja2V0U2F1Y2UyPg=="},"prevInTopic":45454,"nextInTopic":45456,"prevInTime":45454,"nextInTime":45456,"topicId":45410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-So, yeah, I see how awful she s treating her kid but she s convinced it s right!

But once someone&#39;s on an irrational rant, it just kinda  <br/>\nhas to play itself out to its irrational end.   Maybe she&#39;ll think  <br/>\nabout some of these things when she&#39;s exhausted from the fury and come  <br/>\nback and apologize, or maybe she&#39;ll fortify herself with the idea that  <br/>\nshe&#39;s right and we&#39;re crazy, which will fuel her up for her next  <br/>\nexplosive incident.

One was a mom  <br/>\ndefending spanking or something that was making her child cry.   When  <br/>\nI said &quot;HEY, but...&quot; she wrote back that my words had made her cry.     <br/>\nOH DUH!   And I was supposed to feel guilty?  A grown woman&#39;s crying  <br/>\nabout guilt she SHOULD feel?   But complaining about it... in public....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another mom had described the way she was treating her daughter  <br/>\n(not good) and then said the daughter was depressed (and wanted our  <br/>\nhelp) and I wrote that I&#39;d be depressed too.    Shitstorm with  <br/>\nfireworks.   It was to be okay for her to tell a thousand strangers  <br/>\nshe had a depressed teen, and to outline some of the causes, but for  <br/>\nme to say &quot;Wow&quot; was somehow mean and abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one person finds ways to find joy spending time with her child,  <br/>\nall that emotional woundedness is lessened in the world on average,  <br/>\nand the few moms who just wanted us to say &quot;Good job!&quot; about whatever  <br/>\nnonsense they were revealing don&#39;t prevent other moms from seeing that  <br/>\narray of ideas and going with the soft and sweet ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling won&#39;t work for everyone.

I&#39;m grateful that they were verbal  <br/>\nat an early age and not destructive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the first time a mom has come and said her child was  <br/>\nexplosive and uncontrollable and violent, and then at the slightest  <br/>\nhindrance here the mom went explosive and verbally abusive and  <br/>\nirrational.   There can be a connection.   There can&#39;t NOT be a  <br/>\nconnection.   Even without genetics, a mother who is harsh and mean is  <br/>\nlikely to have a harsh and mean reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just spent Holly&#39;s entire life (as she was born when Kirby was  <br/>\nfive, during our first year of unschooling) helping people unschool,  <br/>\nseeing people fail (and often seeing why) and seeing people succeed  <br/>\n(and often getting to work with them for years as they also helped  <br/>\nothers, after they got it).   I DO know more about unschooling than  <br/>\nsomeone who joined the list last week and thinks locking a child in  <br/>\nhis room is good, right or safe.  What if there&#39;s a fire?  What if  <br/>\nhe&#39;s throwing up, or needs the bathroom?    But that&#39;s not about  <br/>\nunschooling at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce knows a lot about unschooling.  Robyn does.   LOTS of the  <br/>\ncontributors to this list, and the quieter readers, know a lot about  <br/>\nunschooling.  That&#39;s pretty wonderful, for people who come here for  <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill unschooling work for everyone?  No.<br/>\nWill it work better for those who will consider changes than for those  <br/>\nwho are happy with mainstream &quot;solutions&quot;?  Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/confidence\">http://sandradodd.com/confidence</a><br/>\nand lest anyone think I&#39;m sending people to something I wrote, that  <br/>\npage has Joyce, me, Jenny Cyphers and Schuyler Waynforth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"katherand@gmail.com","from":"katherand@...","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] good advice and bad advice","postDate":"1242950133","msgId":45432,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4ZTRiYjM3YmNmMWE1ZTc0NzA4M2VhNTNiNGMzNGYxQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwMzAwQjZBLTVCNjctNENFMy05Rjk0LTNGOTg3MzA5RDAzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUxMDdFNUU4LThCRjItNDFFMy1CNDZELTk3OEJGMzFDNjkwOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDRBMTVDOUJELjAwMDAxMy4xMjIwOEBNT1JHQU4tQzc0NzNFQzM+IDw3QkIzQkM4Mi0xREU3LTRGREItQjk5MC00NUNERjQ4RDBDM0VAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwzMDMwMEI2QS01QjY3LTRDRTMtOUY5NC0zRjk4NzMwOUQwM0ZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45430,"nextInTopic":45434,"prevInTime":45431,"nextInTime":45433,"topicId":45410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... types of choices, soon when he chooses the obvious choice repeatedly, a routine will develop, and the problem will vanish.

Until it all turned into <br/>\na nightmare with the punishments, rewards, threats and removals. It seems <br/>\nwrong to turn what should be safe haven into the punishment room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine the cruelty and horror and fear being felt by a child who is <br/>\nafraid of the dark being threatened with removal of the only light. I still <br/>\nget up in the middle of the night to stand by the door of the bathroom with <br/>\nmy daughter who is 9.5 and just a little nervous at times. The response from <br/>\nthis callous mother to her son&#39;s misery is to dish out more punishment and <br/>\ncall it &quot;his choice&quot;. This with the acknowledgment that he has a difficult <br/>\ntemperament.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this possibly less verbal child has no outlet, not even drawing with <br/>\ntoothpaste, for his frustrations, my fear would be that he will start <br/>\nturning on himself physically - maybe pulling out his hair, extreme chewing <br/>\non his fingers, toes or cheeks, throwing himself into walls, hiding a blade <br/>\nand cutting himself.

Do<br/>\nthe nightly routine, of pajamas, teeth, stories and be tucked in, and  <br/>\ngo to<br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat has never happened.  My son has a behavioral disorder, I won&#39;t go  <br/>\ninto<br/>\nit because when I did, the post wasn&#39;t let through.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he&#39;s in constant motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven today, at almost 9 years old, he won&#39;t seek his bed until his his  <br/>\nbody<br/>\ncontrols his will, by basically shutting down on it&#39;s own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave up &quot;putting him to bed&quot; years ago, because it was impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however, mandate a family quiet time at a certain hour, generally  <br/>\nwhen<br/>\nit gets dark outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was an explosive child too, at the age of yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI basically cleared out his room of all stuff that could be dangerous  <br/>\nto him<br/>\ndressers, hard plastic toys, lamps and any other thing with a cord, and<br/>\ncovered all the outlets with locking covers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he had a few softcover books in there, a huge pile of stuffed  <br/>\nanimals and<br/>\na mattress on the floor.  It was not on a bedframe, because he liked  <br/>\nto jump<br/>\non his bed, and could get seriuosly hurt falling off a raised one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the stuff was taken out of his room, to make a safe environment  <br/>\nfor an<br/>\nextreme child.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike your son, he would throw stuff when he was mad. If there were no  <br/>\nhard<br/>\nitems in his room, than no one would get hurt/nothing would get  <br/>\nbroken, and<br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t get the satisfaction of hearing something crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, his clothes and clothes dresser were taken out, so he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nmake<br/>\na mess with them by strewing them about when he got angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd most importantly, a lock on his door.  He couldn&#39;t be made to take a<br/>\ntime out in a corner or chair like on nanny 911, so his near empty  <br/>\nroom was<br/>\nhis time out area, and still is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to the sleep issue, I would just make him understand that  <br/>\nit<br/>\nwas quiet time, and give him choices, he could stay up and do  <br/>\nwhatever, read<br/>\nbooks, play a game, etc. But in one hour he&#39;ll have to go to his own  <br/>\nroom<br/>\nfor the night.    If he made a fuss about going, then he&#39;d have to go  <br/>\nthere<br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, like on Nanny 911, when the parents give ultimatums,<br/>\nthings are hard on the kids, I would put him in there, and he&#39;d kick the<br/>\ndoor and scream.   Then I&#39;d say, &quot;if you want to do that, then I&#39;ll  <br/>\nhave to<br/>\ntake the light bulb out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLike most kids, he doesn&#39;t like being in the dark, but it was a sort of<br/>\ndicipline that could be used, that wouldn&#39;t hurt him, and he chose it,  <br/>\nby<br/>\nnot choosing to accept that it was quiet time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few light bulbs being taken out (these were the over head celing<br/>\nbulbs, so there was no danger of fingers in open sockets)  for a  <br/>\ncouple of<br/>\nminutes, he knew I was serious about what I said.  If he didn&#39;t like  <br/>\nsitting<br/>\nin the dark, he would be quiet in the evenings, after it was dark  <br/>\noutside.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe would also have to stay in his room during quiet time. The door could<br/>\nstay unlocked, if he stayed in his room quietly.  If he couldn&#39;t stay  <br/>\nin his<br/>\nroom himself, then it would be locked. This was also dictated by his  <br/>\nactions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow during quiet time in his room, he can do any manner of things kids  <br/>\ndo in<br/>\ntheir rooms, his choices of this were limited by only being able to play<br/>\nwith the non hard objects in his room, so his choices were play with the<br/>\nstuffed animals or read books.  He&#39;s an avid reader and loves inventing<br/>\nAnimal Town scenerios for his stuffed animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI even would offer a new book he hadn&#39;t read, for complying with the  <br/>\nquiet<br/>\ntime for several days. He LOVES new books, so this was a good incentive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, while in his room, as the night went on, he would just fall  <br/>\nasleep at<br/>\nsome point. I would go in there before I went to bed, and put him in  <br/>\nhis bed<br/>\nif he wasn&#39;t in it, and cover and tuck him in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe would then have to be locked in for his own safety at night.  He was<br/>\nprone to getting into things, and doing things if left unsupervised  <br/>\n( if he<br/>\nawakened, while I was asleep).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also forgot to say, that his room is the the master bedroom, because  <br/>\nit<br/>\nhas a bathroom off the bedroom, so he can go any time he needs to,  <br/>\nwith out<br/>\ndisrupting any one else in the house hold. This bathroom is also empty  <br/>\nof<br/>\nstuff. So I don&#39;t find the walls painted with toothpaste in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would simply try the &quot;choices&quot; method of doing things, it is the only<br/>\ndisipline&quot; that works with my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust state what you&#39;d like him to do, then another slightly<br/>\nunpleasent/unliked choice as the other choice, as I did, with the door  <br/>\nbeing<br/>\nlocked or not, the lightbulb coming out, or not, and the go to your  <br/>\nroom, or<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you could even give the choice of: &quot;you CAN choose a book, and  <br/>\nput your<br/>\npajamas on now, OR you CAN go to your room right now,&quot; which would you  <br/>\nlike?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost would choose the book, pajamas and the accompanying attention,  <br/>\nvs. No<br/>\nattention by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make just about everything (except education style), these  <br/>\ntypes of<br/>\nchoices, soon when he chooses the obvious choice repeatedly, a routine  <br/>\nwill<br/>\ndevelop, and the problem will vanish.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncentives and rewards help reinforce good choices as well.  A reward  <br/>\ncould<br/>\nsimply be a hug and a kiss, words of praise, that sort of thing, vs.  <br/>\nBeing<br/>\nset apart&quot; alone with no interaction/time out.  Most kids would not  <br/>\nchoose<br/>\nthat choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this with my son with &quot;family culture&quot; type stuff, such as putting<br/>\ndishes in the sink, dirty clothes in the hamper,etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a way for him to realize that every person in a family, has the  <br/>\nsame<br/>\nresponsibilities when it comes to general home/self maintenance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t fair for one person to be &quot;Cinderella,&quot; and the others to be  <br/>\nthe<br/>\nstepsisters&quot; who expect the &quot;maid&quot; to take care of their every whim.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time he&#39;s out on his own, these things will happen  <br/>\nautomatically for<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(The post above is NOT unschooling advice; please disregard it for the  <br/>\npurposes of learning to unschool.)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62589750,"authorName":"JudithAnneMurphy@aol.com","from":"JudithAnneMurphy@...","profile":"shepherdlass","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] good advice and bad advice","postDate":"1242946170","msgId":45425,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkNS40ZmZkMTcxNS4zNzQ3MzQ3YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45424,"nextInTopic":45426,"prevInTime":45424,"nextInTime":45426,"topicId":45410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"While no-one likes their messages to be bounced (I ve had a couple that were, but for the very good reason that they were irrelevant to the wider group), it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1407421108\">While no-one likes their messages to be bounced (I&#39;ve had a couple that  <br/>\nwere, but for the very good reason that they were irrelevant to the wider  <br/>\ngroup), it seems disproportionate to release this much vitriol.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 21/05/2009 23:26:16 GMT Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jonaia@...\">jonaia@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I  said about Cinderella, is true, a mom on the other list felt the <br/>\nsame<br/>\nway  too. <br/>\nIt may be true for you and the other mom but I can&#39;t see how you can  <br/>\ngeneralize from this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, He WILL be self sufficient.
