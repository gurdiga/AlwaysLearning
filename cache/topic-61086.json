This is something I realized about myself very early on as a<br/>\nmother--sometimes I would be in the middle of playing a game with my toddler<br/>\nand realize I&#39;d drifted away, mentally, and was making autopilot responses<br/>\nwithout being really tuned in. Many times when that happened, I would<br/>\nactually be *thinking* about the sweet moment we were in the middle of, my<br/>\nlittle girl and I, mentally narrating it the way I might write it down<br/>\nlater, instead of really engaging in the game, looking in my daughter&#39;s<br/>\neyes, smiling a real, present smile, living the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad that in those early days I was reading unschooling chats on AOL,<br/>\nwhere people like Sandra and Pam and others, whose kids were a bit older,<br/>\nwere talking about mindfulness. I worked on being more mindful, turning my<br/>\nthoughts back to the thing that was happening *right now* rather than<br/>\nthinking about the thing that had happened *a few minutes ago* which I might<br/>\nwant to write down *later*. I put those words in asterisks because for me it<br/>\nhas been very important to be aware of *where in time* my thoughts are<br/>\nfocused--past, future, or this moment right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good that I began thinking about thinking, and learning how to change<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m thinking about, when my oldest was a baby, because I have five more<br/>\nkids now and lots more past, present, and future stuff to think about!<br/>\nGiving my full attention to the present moment, the present person, still<br/>\ntakes mindfulness and effort---I don&#39;t mean effort in a bad or negative way,<br/>\nnot a draining-and-depleting kind of effort; I mean it&#39;s something I think<br/>\nabout and make choices about regularly, frequently, moment to moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other things about mindful parenting that come more automatically<br/>\nto me, like knowing how to help kids work out conflicts. I think it&#39;s sort<br/>\nof like driving a car--there are some parts of driving that, after decades<br/>\nof experience, I can do automatically and seldom have to *think* about how<br/>\nI&#39;m doing them, like shifting gears or putting on a blinker. But I DO have<br/>\nto *think about* and pay attention to things like making a left turn when<br/>\nanother car is coming. I&#39;m not a great judge of distances and speed,<br/>\nnaturally. When there are other cars coming and I want to make a turn, I<br/>\nhave to look and think and focus in order to know when to turn safely. The<br/>\n&quot;looking and thinking and focusing&quot; isn&#39;t a big deal, it isn&#39;t taxing, but<br/>\nit does take more attention from me than, say, flicking on my blinker or<br/>\nputting my foot on the brake to stop at a red light.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has excellent depth perception and is a great judge of distances<br/>\nand relative speed. He can make left turns without needing as much mental<br/>\nfocus on the task as I do. That part of driving comes more automatically to<br/>\nhim than it does to me--but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not a good driver, or less<br/>\ncapable of making left turns. It simply means I have to think about left<br/>\nturns with a different degree of attention than he does. Likewise, a natural<br/>\ntendency to get lost in my own thoughts doesn&#39;t mean I *can&#39;t* pay attention<br/>\nto the present moment, or be a good listener. After 15 years of practice,<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned lots of ways to focus my attention on the present moment, just<br/>\nlike I&#39;ve learned how to make left turns. :) Some things that help me stay<br/>\n&#39;in the moment&#39; are looking into my kids&#39; eyes, smiling, fixing a snack for<br/>\nus to share together, playing games like Mario Kart (it&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>\nwander off in thoughts about the scene you&#39;re writing when you&#39;re dodging<br/>\nbanana peels and bombs) or Munchkin or Scrabble, singing, reading together,<br/>\nwatching movies, looking at family photos together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m playing with one of the younger ones--cars or Lego or dolls,<br/>\nsay--and I find my thoughts starting to drift away, often I&#39;ll remember<br/>\nsomething Sandra wrote about smelling your child&#39;s hair. It&#39;s on the peace<br/>\npage and the context is about staying calm and peaceful, but it applies to<br/>\nbeing mindful and present, too:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Smell your child&#39;s hair.

My 9 year old spends a lot of time on the computer so I have two computers set up next to each other. I can be on the computer working while my daughter is next to me. Having her next to me allows me to stop occasionally and stroke her hair and tell her I love her. I can occasionally look over and ask her what is going on in her game. It also allows her to say, &quot;hey mom, check this out&quot; if she gets something really cool in her game. Having the toys and TV in the same space allows my younger kids to be playing around us so that I can do the same with them. I can be on the floor with the 2 year old and 4 year old and not be too far away from my 9 year old. If my 6 year old wants to be next to her big sister, she can be there and they help each other with their games. If my 6 year old wants to play with the younger two, she can. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe smallish house works to my advantage for being present for my kids because I can call out to them from any room in the house without too much trouble. Even when my kids are engrossed in their own games, I make it a point to check in with them and see what they are playing or how their game is going. Sometimes, I call out to them just to say I love you. It&#39;s really sweet because they have started doing the same to me. My 6 year old will run up to me and say &quot;Mom, mom, mom&quot; in a rather urgent voice. When I say, &quot;What?&quot;, she will grin and say, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Being present","postDate":"1304696671","msgId":61097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlxMTUwditrb290QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlxMDhsdStxdHVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61093,"nextInTopic":61098,"prevInTime":61096,"nextInTime":61098,"topicId":61086,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************** I wonder if you re imagining present as being some special super-aware, super-engaged state?

Now and then a child needs a whole lot of that, but more often kids just need normal sorts of attention - think &quot;available&quot; rather than &quot;present&quot; maybe. If you&#39;re &quot;available&quot; both physically (in the same room) and emotionally (responding to smiles, questions, touches and offering some of those, too) then your child will let you know when he needs more than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re used to tuning him out, work on being more available even if what that means right away is something as simple as brining your projects into his space or setting up more fun kid-stuff in your space (assuming you have a house with that much space ;)).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; When I try and sit with myself and my feelings, I start to feel terrible...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes &quot;siting with feelings&quot; is more like wallowing than any kind of healthy self-reflection and then its not such a good thing to do. If you want to get in touch with your feelings more, it could be better for you to notice them in passing rather than trying to &quot;sit with&quot; them. Knowing you&#39;re a little grumpy can be helpful in terms of making better choices. Sitting around in grumpiness can bog you down and make it harder to think clearly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I am replicating a lot of her behaviour and I really don&#39;t want to, but I find it hard to do otherwise. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall steps forward are still steps forward! Replicating &quot;a lot&quot; of your mother isn&#39;t the same as being your mother. You get to be someone else, a different mother. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can think of a time when you&#39;re defaulting to a behavior you don&#39;t like, try to think of an alternative - I mean right now, or at least outside of the moment when you&#39;re defaulting. It&#39;s much harder to come up with alternatives in the moment, but if you come up with an idea &quot;for next time&quot; that gives you a choice. You can stop and choose to do something different. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Being present","postDate":"1304688794","msgId":61093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2NzI3MkVGLTEyQ0QtNDIzMy1BNzMxLUI1MTk3MEU3MDlCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlxMHFodSt2bmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlxMHFodSt2bmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61091,"nextInTopic":61097,"prevInTime":61092,"nextInTime":61094,"topicId":61086,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-when I am really participating and having fun with them, it is wonderful for so many reasons.-=- I ve seen in my life and others that being the best mom I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2061038753\">-=-when I am really participating and having fun with them, it is wonderful for so many reasons.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen in my life and others&#39; that being the best mom I could be, even a few moments a day, helped my own sense of sorrow about childhood issues, and made me feel successful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It is very difficult, very confronting, to face up to our deepest problems, things that could stretch back to our own childhoods.

We&#39;ve had conversation after conversation about how she could start to deal with things, but it never leads to action. Now she&#39;s 38, in a dead-end relationship with a man who&#39;s just had a vastectomy, and wondering if she wants kids, and if so, how on earth she could make it happen. A big mess that&#39;s only gotten worse over the past decade, and now with major life consequences. She often says that she likes to keep busy so she doesn&#39;t have time to think, and when she does find herself in a quiet moment she&#39;s in tears of despair at how unhappy she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very difficult, very confronting, to face up to our deepest problems, things that could stretch back to our own childhoods. But without that willingness to face and overcome our problems, it&#39;s very likely that we will end up repeating the same behaviours, and, unfortunately, passing those problems on to our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, I struggled all my life with feelings of worthlessness, until in a breakthrough moment I fully grasped that I am not worthless, that I am a worthwhile person, and that I will pull out all stops to preserve my kids&#39; sense of self-worth undamaged. And what that means on a day-to-day level is playing with them - sitting down on the floor and playing horses, fetching props and scissors, paper etc, making up stories, and so on. There are times when I am not fully concentrating, when I am waiting for a chance to duck off and do one of the housework jobs, but when I am really participating and having fun with them, it is wonderful for so many reasons. My kids feel loved, they feel that I want to be with them. Our shared experiences create strong bonds of understanding, and a continuity in the fabric of our lives. And I feel like I am doing a good job of being their mum, my confidence grows, and my ability to deal with all sorts of daily situations improves.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeelie, in your case I would suggest that you gather your courage and squarely face the &#39;big stuff&#39; (you mentioned your partner and your mother), but also on a day-to-day level, think about how precious your son is, how fleeting his childhood is, how brilliant it would be to build a really strong, connected relationship with him. Housework can still be done, but perhaps in a more piecemeal fashion, or by making it a game that your son can join in. And, by playing with him, trying to see the world through his eyes, you get a second chance at childhood wonder, which is so soothing to a jaded and weary soul.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;keeliereader&quot; &lt;keeliebean@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since I have been reading about unschooling and working on my relationship with my son a few things have become apparent to me and I feel stuck.
