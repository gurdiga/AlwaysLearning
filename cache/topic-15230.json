They&#39;ve seen it at different places but don&#39;t pay <br/>\nmuch attention to it--something like that was how I put it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimes change.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the kids have gotten to where they want to go to the library to <br/>\nwatch Thomas videos on the computer game. They want me to drive 90 miles <br/>\nto the train museum so they can watch train videos. Hmmm...time to get a TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Brian and I went to a pawn shop and spent $225 on a combo TV/VCR/DVD <br/>\n(figured I&#39;d get less flack for one big expenditure and on bit thing <br/>\nthan on a whole bunch of stuff). Then we bought two train videos, a dump <br/>\ntruck video, two Thomas videos, and checked out video policies at the <br/>\nlibrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TV&#39;s in the living room--which I don&#39;t like--I&#39;d envisioned it in <br/>\nthe playroom--but doing fine. The kids are happy, and perhaps the next <br/>\ntime we go to the train museum we can enjoy the trains, although they <br/>\nhave a DIFFERENT video than we have, so perhaps they&#39;ll want to watch it <br/>\nstill.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15129,"nextTopicId":15231}}
