I haven’t been near or with my kids as much as I usually am (meaning on my computer while they entertain themselves and get their own snacks, which they clearly don’t mind as much as I do). Guilt, guilt, guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis poured out into hidden ‘have-to’ thoughts that I didn’t really realize I was having.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI do run everything about the show and I work hard to make it as comfortable as possible for everyone who is there with me: staff, family, volunteers and customers. My girls spent time yesterday making comfortable places to lie down out of plastic bags, rolled mats and beanbag chairs. They played their DS’s, had swordfights with some dowel rods, and my littlest ran up and down the hall with a tattered black garbage bag ‘cape’ tied around her neck, striking superhero poses.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two older girls decided they’d like to work at the show because they would both like to buy a laptop. They already know how many hours each day they’ll have to work to earn enough money to buy one and spent time alternating between working and relaxing yesterday. My littlest realized that if both of her sisters were going to buy laptops, she would have our one ‘kids’ computer at home all to herself, so she figured out that she didn’t need to work at all (smart girl!), although she joined us when the jobs looked fun. We managed to get home before 9pm last night and I told all of the girls that they could relax and sleep in and wait until their dad gets up for work and he would drop them off at the hall today. They all insisted that they wanted to go with me first thing in the morning and begged me to wake them before I left (one even picked clothes out last night and had them in her bed with her). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted it wasn’t all peaches and roses yesterday. At times one wanted to go home, a couple of times they fought with each other, and a couple of them hurt themselves, but that would happen on a typical day here at home too. Clearly they’re not miserable, frustrated, and feeling neglected. During the day I help them as often as I can and work to keep our interactions calm and kind, even when I’m stressed. I love doing the show because it gives me a chance to exercise my analytical skills and problem solving on a massive scale. I also have always loved showing my kids that they can do anything they choose, big or small (they’ve watched the show grow tremendously over the years), and that hard work and treating others with respect can be very rewarding on many levels. They also know I’m working hard at this show to earn some extra money for our cross-country road trip next month so we can do more fun things along the way. And yet the guilt still nags that my choices impact their lives, even if it doesn’t seem like it bothers them nearly as much.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for inner peace and calm &gt;&gt;Katie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex Polikowsky","from":"Alex Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to Deal with Highly Structured Periods of Time","postDate":"1363641522","msgId":71008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM5RDRBMUFCLTM1MEMtNDZBNi04Rjg1LThDQjdCNDVGRjEwMUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjM2Mzk0MzMuMTY1OTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwMS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAyNmUwMWNlMjM4NCQ2NzFlY2M5MCQzNTVjNjViMCRAc3ppaXNvZnQuY29tPiA8MTM2MzYzOTQzMy4xNjU5Ny5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIwOTAxLm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71006,"nextInTopic":71022,"prevInTime":71007,"nextInTime":71009,"topicId":70998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That is a great idea Jenny!

That can look like they &quot;love&quot; it at first but &quot;end up&quot; miserable. Do check that they really do love being there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso your kids are not a homogenous mass. Maybe some like it more than others. Maybe some are more miserable than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have a really long event, like a craft show, Jayn will often come along with me in the morning, but not stay the whole time. Is there a reason why Dad can&#39;t come by after work and collect them rather than have them there til 10pm? If he is working late shift hours, can he bring them over before he goes to work rather than have them start so early?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin got in first with pretty much the same practical suggestions I was going to make. Jayn has been picked up from events I was doing by her friends to go out with them rather than stay on at a dull grown up event too. Jayn also brings her hand held gaming device with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things are out of your/anyone&#39;s control, but that does not mean everything is so. It can be a residue of conventional parenting, to act as if many things are out of your control when the truth is that you are making choices. Sometimes it&#39;s a lot easier to tell children &quot;that&#39;s how it has to be&quot; than to do the mental gymnastics of finding other options. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is some fuzzy all or nothing thinking going on. If this is your event, and you are organizing the food, surely you are not as helpless as you seem to feel about including items your kids like. Too long a day? If you are in charge make the day shorter. Too long a week? If you are the organizer, make the event fewer days. You don&#39;t have to defend your event to us - I&#39;m just tossing ideas for different ways thinking about it, so that if you are thinking is &quot;it has to be this way&quot; - well maybe it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really do have the choice not to create this tradeshow, or continue to run it yourself. So seeing it AS a choice is the first step to seeing other choices and ways to be flexible and accommodating and facilitating for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

During this time<br/>\nthey only have limited access to foods they like (I&#39;m responsible for<br/>\nfeeding large groups of people and have volunteers pick up prearranged meals<br/>\nand deliver them, because I can&#39;t even leave during the day). There&#39;s no<br/>\ninternet connection, no video games, no comfy bed or couch, and<br/>\nunfortunately not much access to me during the hours we&#39;re there for the<br/>\nweek of the show.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring air mattresses and snacks as much as I can to make sure they&#39;re<br/>\ncomfortable, but needs are hard to predict or plan for. Now that they&#39;re old<br/>\nenough, they can help a little and get involved in running the event, but<br/>\nthey do end up miserable now and then and want and need things that I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t give them while I&#39;m there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you dealt with something like this? Do you just explain it as a<br/>\n&#39;season&#39; and make the best you can of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70870,"nextTopicId":70933}}
