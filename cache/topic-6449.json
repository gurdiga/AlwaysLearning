But my kids never did go to school, and we&#39;ve been and  <br/>\nstayed close all that time.  They&#39;ve talked to me when they were  <br/>\ndrinking.

We went to lots of churches in small groups to see<br/>\nwhat would happen. We didn&#39;t get glad handed, but then<br/>\nagain, nobody was &quot;politely shown to the basement&quot;<br/>\neither.

But to me, it makes me feel better to not<br/>\ngive any of my money to a company that has had such serious problems.<br/>\nSure, maybe they are doing better now... but.... The original complaints<br/>\ncame out in the late 80&#39;s, and Mark and I decided then not to eat<br/>\nthere.  The only reason we did so on that night is that I was alone,<br/>\ntraveling with two children who had slept through our usual stopping<br/>\nplace (barstow) and the kids woke up, hungry, right before this little<br/>\ntown with a huge thermometer in the middle of the desert.  I had a few<br/>\nthings to eat in the car but not a meal and we were still 2 hours<br/>\noutside of Vegas, where Mark was playing for 9 weeks.  We would go every<br/>\nother weekend.  I had been trying to get out of town, to beat traffic,<br/>\nand was planning on stopping at the grocery store in barstow but when<br/>\nthe kids were asleep I changed my plan and pushed on, thinking I&#39;d stop<br/>\nfor food in vegas.  When we hit baker and the kids were awake, there<br/>\nweren&#39;t a lot of choices. So I too thought--hmm, those cases happened in<br/>\nNorthern CA, and in Florida, and that was a few years ago, surely<br/>\nthey&#39;ve changed, and I have two hungry kids and I&#39;m white.... So I<br/>\nstopped.  Wrong decision.  So for me, I just won&#39;t give my money to<br/>\nDenny&#39;s, and I won&#39;t risk taking my children into a place where this has<br/>\nhappened to them, I won&#39;t even suggest it, even if they would allow it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or encouraging kids to stick<br/>\n&gt; tongues out at it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have a very good point, but I think for Lexie and Janene, it&#39;s very<br/>\ncathartic.  Lexie especially still struggles over this and I think it<br/>\nmakes them feel better. But I think you are right, I think I will<br/>\nmention next time that maybe they need to put this behind them, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d hate if a family stuck their tongue out at my house every time<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; passed by, or my business, or my church, or my favorite record store,<br/>\n&gt; if it<br/>\n&gt; was based on something that happened several states away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Now you&#39;ll probably say &quot;Hey!

I was married there, as was my<br/>\nsister. I attended youth group there, taught sunday school and also<br/>\nworked in the Mother&#39;s day Out program for about 6 months one year, when<br/>\nI was in college.  My sister&#39;s in-laws go to church there still and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure I&#39;m still a member on the books, at least.  I have fond memories of<br/>\nthat church, and I might visit once in a while but I doubt if I&#39;ll ever<br/>\nattend again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why?

Millie Conrad (my sister&#39;s in laws) have been<br/>\ngoing to that church for as long as we have known them. It was the<br/>\nchurch of my youth, my parents ran the youth program when I was a<br/>\nchild.  Millie was my brother&#39;s preschool teacher in 1974 something, and<br/>\nthen Julie and her son were married, and then my grandmother lived with<br/>\nher mother-in-law for a while, until the mil died and then Millie found<br/>\nanother old lady from the church for my grandmother to live with until<br/>\nthat old lady died... anyway, I guess that church and our family are<br/>\npretty interwined together.

He used to apologize to my sister and I because we (as he would say) &quot;had to go to school with them&quot;. I really didn&#39;t understand what he was talking about. My grandmother, (his mother) would make racial slurs to my sister and I about black parts of town, of which I really never understood. I don&#39;t know what it was that made me not see what they were saying. I was always the kind of person who saw people, not color. It was when I became an adult that I saw racism, but to my surprise it was against me. The truth is, I will  never know what it feels like to be called a nigger... (that word is hard to type, yuk). What surprised me was how racist some black people were. At first I thought it was just simple racism, when they called me racist names, and referred to my children in the same way. But now, while it still hurts, I think it was more of a feeling that they wanted to retaliate for all the hurtful racist remarks made to them by other white folks. I think we all need to realize that racist remarks, or web sites or books or any form of racism is harmful. It doesn&#39;t matter if the racist remark is intended for white or black folks. We are all human beings, all with feelings, and it&#39;s harm is more outreaching than you might think. I am so sorry for what happened to you at Denny&#39;s.

I DO feel differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had never really considered this whole angle. I guess for me,<br/>\n&gt; sheltering my kid from a lot of the evil in life has never been an<br/>\n&gt; option, it just wasn&#39;t possible... she&#39;s just been there, and we<br/>\n&gt; talked a<br/>\n&gt; lot about things, but she knew. I was a single mom getting aid from<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; state when she was born, and stayed that way until she was almost 5,<br/>\n&gt; while I went to college. We paid for food with funky colored &quot;money&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; got shit from the other people in line for buying things that were<br/>\n&gt; &quot;too<br/>\n&gt; expensive&quot; or &quot;too junky&quot;, we went to too many appointments in big<br/>\n&gt; crowded places where you get there at 6:30 to get a good place in<br/>\n&gt; line,<br/>\n&gt; even though the door doesn&#39;t open until 7, and there&#39;s always a<br/>\n&gt; security<br/>\n&gt; guard at the door and kids running around and being hit, and<br/>\n&gt; someonething<br/>\n&gt; inevitably goes wrong, if not for us than for someone else, who then<br/>\n&gt; screams and swears until she is escorted out by said security guard.<br/>\n&gt; And<br/>\n&gt; WIC was another appointment, and then there&#39;s the Section 8 annual<br/>\n&gt; inspection... and we visited her father in the jails and prisons until<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; she was almost 4, which involved waiting, and being searched, and<br/>\n&gt; going<br/>\n&gt; through the metal detector, and waiting some more, and riding the bus<br/>\n&gt; (she still remembers the bus at Perryville)...We lived right down the<br/>\n&gt; street from the welfare office when she was born, and people would<br/>\n&gt; come<br/>\n&gt; by and throw food to our dog and we&#39;d go out and ask them not to<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; it made her sick, but gently... it was all there, and we saw a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people and they all had stories...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And there&#39;s the whole issue of letting her visit with her dad<br/>\n&gt; unsupervised, which I started doing when she was 5 or so, because it<br/>\n&gt; seemed to solve more problems than it created... but he does have that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;checkered past&quot;, she needed to know that if he drinks or smokes pot,<br/>\n&gt; call me, and I&#39;ll come get her, and if he hits her, call me, and tell<br/>\n&gt; me... none of that has ever happened with the two of them (well,<br/>\n&gt; except I<br/>\n&gt; suspect he&#39;s smoked), but it all happened with  him and me. Now her<br/>\n&gt; dad<br/>\n&gt; is homeless, living in his car, and she knows that, although for the<br/>\n&gt; first few weeks she didn&#39;t. It sucks, she&#39;s worried about him, she<br/>\n&gt; offered her bedroom floor to him, but he wouldn&#39;t take it... so she<br/>\n&gt; got<br/>\n&gt; him to take a wool blanket and a cake she baked, and felt better, and<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; often sleeps at the highway rest stop nearest to our house, so we see<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; driving home... but it makes you think differently about &quot;the<br/>\n&gt; homeless&quot;<br/>\n&gt; when that means Dad...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t realize that he was homeless.  This must be so hard for all of<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a point here. We live differently than a lot<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; people, I guess... it never would occur to me not to tell my kid if<br/>\n&gt; someone we knew had that link on his webpage. It would never occur to<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; to hide that. Maybe that comes from having been hated as the lazy<br/>\n&gt; drain-on-the-system welfare mom with the bastard kid. I also spent 6<br/>\n&gt; years in the psych hospital gulag before Cacie was born, being hated.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe being hated makes you respond differently to hatred, in any<br/>\n&gt; form.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t know if this is better or worse, maybe she would be a<br/>\n&gt; happier<br/>\n&gt; person if I&#39;d been married and middle-class and she didn&#39;t know about<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; this stuff as a little kid. I haven&#39;t spent any time thinking about<br/>\n&gt; it,<br/>\n&gt; really. I imagine she&#39;d be a different person.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, she would be, but then, I love you both just the way you are.<br/>\nSappy, I know, but the truth.  Your experiences have shaped you and I&#39;ll<br/>\nnever forget how when Anthony (my nephew) wanted to move the bed into<br/>\nthe other room when we stayed with you and you not only said OK but was<br/>\nvery much positive about him doing this--you felt this was a perfectly<br/>\nacceptable and wonderful idea and by this ONE ACTION and ATTITUDE I<br/>\nlearned more then I learned from many parenting books.  Anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with what you said.  It would have been nice to protect my<br/>\nchildren from racism and all the other crap out there, but I couldn&#39;t.<br/>\nJanene was only 9 months old and she has no memory of not being served<br/>\nat denny&#39;s but Lexie does.  They pass a Denny&#39;s and stick their tongues<br/>\nout and I almost want to teach them the finger so they can do that, but<br/>\nfor now their antics of flipping off Denny&#39;s with their tongues and body<br/>\nlanguage is enough.   I cried for a long time over Denny&#39;s, because it<br/>\ndid shatter Lexie&#39;s innocence. For months and months afterwards we&#39;d go<br/>\nout to eat and as we would get out of the car Lexie would ask &quot;mommy are<br/>\nyou sure they serve black people here?&quot;  And while occassionally I would<br/>\nlaugh and say &quot;no they serve chicken and steak, not humans&quot; mostly I<br/>\njust reassured her that I believed there wouldn&#39;t be a problem but I had<br/>\nmy doubt too.  Always before I woudl walk into a place to eat, knowing I<br/>\nwould be served, demanding not only simply food, but good service, that<br/>\nmy ice water be filled up promtly and that my food be cooked to my<br/>\nliking but now, I had doubts that I would even be served ice water at<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine has a little white, beautifully red headed child named<br/>\nmeg.  Meg is a year younger than Lexie and the other day her mother was<br/>\ntelling me she bought a book and it wasn&#39;t until she was reading it to<br/>\nMeg that she realized that the book was talking about how everyone has<br/>\ndifferent color skins and how they can still be friends.  She said she<br/>\ndistracted Meg and didn&#39;t finish the story--she said Meg doesn&#39;t realize<br/>\nthat Lexie and Meg have different colored skins and has never had the<br/>\nidea that children of different colors might not get along and she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to plant that idea into her child&#39;s head. And while I<br/>\ndisagree with the first point (I&#39;m sure that Meg has noticed the<br/>\ndifference in skin color, she just doesn&#39;t care and hasn&#39;t commented on<br/>\nit as yet), I don&#39;t know that it is always such a good idea to protect<br/>\nour children from the bad stuff.  Although maybe if my children were<br/>\nwhite and I lived in an area where I was able to fool myself better and<br/>\nsay that racism is less than it was 30 years ago, maybe I would want to<br/>\nprotect my children.  But I don&#39;t, and we don&#39;t, and I can&#39;t fool<br/>\nmyself.  Racism is alive and well, although more subtle--most of the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s sad but Mark and I have talked about an aspect of education that<br/>\nmost of you have never thought of--how do we prepare our children for<br/>\nthe first time they are called a nigger.  What will they say, how will<br/>\nthey respond.  I remember being called a nigger lover when I was about 7<br/>\nand I had never heard the word and had no idea how to respond.  How does<br/>\none respond to that?  Lexie has watched Roots, she&#39;s read Amastad, not<br/>\njust the kid&#39;s version but I read to her the adult version, and she<br/>\nwatched the movie. She is getting an education about her past so that<br/>\nshe can be better prepared to deal with the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know the answer to the question.  I guess if this man is<br/>\nnot the teacher, and only is one of the other members, then I&#39;d leave<br/>\nwell enough alone. But I would let my son know, and I&#39;d let him know<br/>\nwhich one.  Two years ago we lived near a white supremist. I would see<br/>\nhim driving and walking his dog, etc.  I knew he was--he had a bunch of<br/>\ntelling stickers on his white truck, shaved head, and stared at me every<br/>\ntime he saw me and the girls together.  Lexie was younger but now, I<br/>\nthink I would point out his car, point out the confederate flag and the<br/>\nother stickers--she needs to know this person, and know that he is not<br/>\none to trust. See Lexie, this is why, this is the signs, see the flag,<br/>\nsee the shaved head, be aware, be careful.  Knowledge is power,<br/>\ninformation is key to making good decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said last night at a LLL meeting--I only read books that say<br/>\nwhat I want to hear, that say breastfeeding is good, to not circ, etc.<br/>\nI was thinking--how narrow minded that is.  I read everything and then<br/>\nmake up my own mind.  It was only after reading Ferber&#39;s book that I<br/>\ntruly understood why someone might want to do that to a baby, and also<br/>\nthat everything the man said was not bad--he had some good ideas about<br/>\nsleep, just not about teaching babies to sleep alone.

I guess for me,<br/>\nsheltering my kid from a lot of the evil in life has never been an<br/>\noption, it just wasn&#39;t possible... she&#39;s just been there, and we talked a<br/>\nlot about things, but she knew. I was a single mom getting aid from the<br/>\nstate when she was born, and stayed that way until she was almost 5,<br/>\nwhile I went to college. We paid for food with funky colored &quot;money&quot; and<br/>\ngot shit from the other people in line for buying things that were &quot;too<br/>\nexpensive&quot; or &quot;too junky&quot;, we went to too many appointments in big<br/>\ncrowded places where you get there at 6:30 to get a good place in line,<br/>\neven though the door doesn&#39;t open until 7, and there&#39;s always a security<br/>\nguard at the door and kids running around and being hit, and someonething<br/>\ninevitably goes wrong, if not for us than for someone else, who then<br/>\nscreams and swears until she is escorted out by said security guard. And<br/>\nWIC was another appointment, and then there&#39;s the Section 8 annual<br/>\ninspection... and we visited her father in the jails and prisons until<br/>\nshe was almost 4, which involved waiting, and being searched, and going<br/>\nthrough the metal detector, and waiting some more, and riding the bus<br/>\n(she still remembers the bus at Perryville)...We lived right down the<br/>\nstreet from the welfare office when she was born, and people would come<br/>\nby and throw food to our dog and we&#39;d go out and ask them not to because<br/>\nit made her sick, but gently... it was all there, and we saw a lot of<br/>\npeople and they all had stories...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s the whole issue of letting her visit with her dad<br/>\nunsupervised, which I started doing when she was 5 or so, because it<br/>\nseemed to solve more problems than it created... but he does have that<br/>\n&quot;checkered past&quot;, she needed to know that if he drinks or smokes pot,<br/>\ncall me, and I&#39;ll come get her, and if he hits her, call me, and tell<br/>\nme... none of that has ever happened with the two of them (well, except I<br/>\nsuspect he&#39;s smoked), but it all happened with  him and me. Now her dad<br/>\nis homeless, living in his car, and she knows that, although for the<br/>\nfirst few weeks she didn&#39;t. It sucks, she&#39;s worried about him, she<br/>\noffered her bedroom floor to him, but he wouldn&#39;t take it... so she got<br/>\nhim to take a wool blanket and a cake she baked, and felt better, and he<br/>\noften sleeps at the highway rest stop nearest to our house, so we see him<br/>\ndriving home... but it makes you think differently about &quot;the homeless&quot;<br/>\nwhen that means Dad...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a point here. We live differently than a lot of<br/>\npeople, I guess... it never would occur to me not to tell my kid if<br/>\nsomeone we knew had that link on his webpage. It would never occur to me<br/>\nto hide that. Maybe that comes from having been hated as the lazy<br/>\ndrain-on-the-system welfare mom with the bastard kid. I also spent 6<br/>\nyears in the psych hospital gulag before Cacie was born, being hated.<br/>\nMaybe being hated makes you respond differently to hatred, in any form. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t know if this is better or worse, maybe she would be a happier<br/>\nperson if I&#39;d been married and middle-class and she didn&#39;t know about all<br/>\nthis stuff as a little kid.
