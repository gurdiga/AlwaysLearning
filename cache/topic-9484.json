When what one drives says so much? I imagine there are a<br/>\nfew big urban centers and college towns where the car one drives isn&#39;t very<br/>\nimportant, and one can use public transportation, but in many places, what<br/>\nkind of a job you get or whether you are hired at all is dependent on your<br/>\nvehicle and how it *looks*. Now, I&#39;ve worked in factories, in kitchens, in<br/>\nschools, in corporations. A few of the jobs used education as a means of<br/>\nsorting out the unworthy but for many of those places one&#39;s transportation<br/>\nsaid a lot about who you were and what you could do/be for the company. It<br/>\nisn&#39;t any wonder to me that people who live in cheap little rentals will drive<br/>\nan expensive car. That car represents how people in the outside world will see<br/>\nthem...
