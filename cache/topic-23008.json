There are too many choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child I enjoyed watching my father work on building projects  <br/>\naround the house. But as an adult I find doing them myself isn&#39;t  <br/>\nnearly as much fun. I&#39;d much rather help someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the feelings you&#39;re going through. You want someone to tell  <br/>\nyou how to get him to change so you can get what you want. But the  <br/>\ntruth is that you can&#39;t do that without hurting him and hurting your  <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although it is so much better than it used to be, he will still ask<br/>\n&gt; for the 2 hours of the babys nap to play with me the whole time,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, look at it from his point of view. He used to have you all to  <br/>\nhimself. Now he has to share you with the baby. But when that daily  <br/>\nopportunity comes when he can pretend it&#39;s still just the two of you  <br/>\nyou want to work it so you&#39;re away from him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thereby stealing all of the only time that i have for anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get up earlier. Go to bed later. Hire someone. Get a mother&#39;s helper  <br/>\nto spend some time with your son. Invite other kids over. Help him  <br/>\nfind friends so he&#39;s out of the house for a bit. Rethink the task you  <br/>\nhave to do. Someone said they only used just enough dishes for one  <br/>\nmeal so she had to wash them right away so she never had a huge pile  <br/>\nof dishes to do. Some people store their clothes in the laundry in  <br/>\nbins and hanging racks so doing the laundry is *much* easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to dismiss the ideas because it would be easier and more  <br/>\nconvenient if he&#39;d just change, but you won&#39;t be able to get him to  <br/>\nchange. If you make his happy childhood your priority you&#39;ll find  <br/>\nways to make things simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And if I say no, i just wind up feeling so guilty that i go and play.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your heart speaking. Listen to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he looks back on his childhood he&#39;s going to have either the  <br/>\nimpression that you were always there for him or that you were always  <br/>\ntoo busy. You *can&#39;t* get him to see the importance of the tasks  <br/>\naround the house. He&#39;s not old enough. He can only interpret &quot;I have  <br/>\nother things that need done,&quot; as saying other things are more  <br/>\nimportant than he is. And it&#39;s going to be especially hard if you&#39;re  <br/>\nsaying during the only time he sees that you belong to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That is one of the reasons we went back to structure. I enjoy playing<br/>\n&gt; with my son quite a bit, but 2 hours of pretending to be the<br/>\n&gt; zookeeper for a fort zoo is toooooooooo much. How do you handle this<br/>\n&gt; type of thing ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By telling him that it isn&#39;t your favorite thing to do but you&#39;ll do  <br/>\nit for 30 minutes. Before he asks, maybe in the morning, tell him  <br/>\nthat you&#39;d like to find some other things to do during the 2 hours of  <br/>\nthe baby&#39;s nap because you have a hard time playing zoo keeper that  <br/>\nlong. Make a list. That way he knows what&#39;s coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Second, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i<br/>\n&gt; guess is the only way to put it with him friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That could be a reaction to extreme stress. It&#39;s a 5 yo version of  <br/>\n&quot;Thank goodness I don&#39;t have to do that stuff anymore!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWild animals who&#39;ve been caged tend to bolt if they get the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He seemed to get<br/>\n&gt; the notion he was above them and that he was smarter, and it<br/>\n&gt; reflected in his relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t project adult motivations on a child. I child who says &quot;I  <br/>\nhate you!&quot; isn&#39;t saying the same thing as an adult. They&#39;re coming  <br/>\nfrom a totally different mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe his partner. Help him be a better friend. Help him find better  <br/>\nways to relieve his stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A couple questions from a newbie..TIA !","postDate":"1127152821","msgId":23020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZGYwMWM1YmQ0NCQwMzg2Zjg1MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRnbW9kaCt2bDA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23019,"nextInTopic":23022,"prevInTime":23019,"nextInTime":23021,"topicId":23008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I could be wrong, but that is my understanding from the list description:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families. This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion-there are hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.

You may find <br/>\nthat, having satisfied his need not only *for* you but to know he can <br/>\ntrust you, his demands on your time and attention will decrease.  You <br/>\nhave to be patient, though, and absolutely cheerful and sincere; no <br/>\nsighing and clockwatching.  If zookeeping isn&#39;t your thing, after <br/>\nawhile, suggest something else, but still -- if it&#39;s within his time, <br/>\nit&#39;s fair to do what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i<br/>\n&gt; guess is the only way to put it with him friends.

I have done some unschooling (a couple weeks) then I <br/>\ngot nervous and went back to the homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a couple questions you may be able to help me with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, my son loves to be with me, and I with him. But without an <br/>\nactivity handed to him, he will want me to amuse him at all times. <br/>\nAlthough it is so much better than it used to be, he will still ask <br/>\nfor the 2 hours of the babys nap to play with me the whole time, <br/>\nthereby stealing all of the only time that i have for anything else. <br/>\nAnd if I say no, i just wind up feeling so guilty that i go and play. <br/>\nThat is one of the reasons we went back to structure. I enjoy playing <br/>\nwith my son quite a bit, but 2 hours of pretending to be the <br/>\nzookeeper for a fort zoo is toooooooooo much. How do you handle this <br/>\ntype of thing ?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i <br/>\nguess is the only way to put it with him friends. He seemed to get <br/>\nthe notion he was above them and that he was smarter, and it <br/>\nreflected in his relationships. I dont know if that is just because <br/>\nhis self esteem is so good that he is just going to relate taht way <br/>\nfor awhile or what. Any info would help !<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23016,"nextTopicId":23014}}
