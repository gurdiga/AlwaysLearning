Kass & Kree, 11 yo twin dd&#39;s, asked today if I could start <br/>\n  giving them spelling tests. I was taken aback and said, &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what <br/>\n  you want....&quot; They said they don&#39;t want to write out definitions and they <br/>\n  don&#39;t want to write them 3 times each or anything like that, but that they <br/>\n  would like to write a sentence using each word. I&#39;m torn between wondering if <br/>\n  they are feeling like they are behind in something, (they have been playing <br/>\n  with the kid next door whom we, dh & I can&#39;t stand) or if they are just <br/>\n  leading themselves in wanting to pursue mastering spelling. I don&#39;t want to <br/>\n  make a big deal about it and have them think I don&#39;t want them to learn these <br/>\n  things, but they specifcally said test and my hair on the back of my neck <br/>\n  stood up. Yuck, was all I could think. So when I get done writing this I will <br/>\n  begin to make up a list of words, but any feed back from you all would be <br/>\n  greatly appreciated. I asked them why they wanted to do this and they said <br/>\n  they were bored today and were thinking if they had words to study, they <br/>\n  could be doing that. I don&#39;t buy that as the true reason, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>\n  disuede them from learning irregardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks in advance,<br/>\n  Rhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Maybe I just need to not <br/>\nbe wigging out. Kass & Kree, 11 yo twin dd&#39;s, asked today if I could start <br/>\ngiving them spelling tests. I was taken aback and said, &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what <br/>\nyou want....&quot; They said they don&#39;t want to write out definitions and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to write them 3 times each or anything like that, but that they <br/>\nwould like to write a sentence using each word. I&#39;m torn between wondering if <br/>\nthey are feeling like they are behind in something, (they have been playing <br/>\nwith the kid next door whom we, dh & I can&#39;t stand) or if they are just <br/>\nleading themselves in wanting to pursue mastering spelling. I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nmake a big deal about it and have them think I don&#39;t want them to learn these <br/>\nthings, but they specifcally said test and my hair on the back of my neck <br/>\nstood up. Yuck, was all I could think. So when I get done writing this I will <br/>\nbegin to make up a list of words, but any feed back from you all would be <br/>\ngreatly appreciated. I asked them why they wanted to do this and they said <br/>\nthey were bored today and were thinking if they had words to study, they <br/>\ncould be doing that. I don&#39;t buy that as the true reason, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndisuede them from learning irregardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14547,"nextTopicId":14245}}
