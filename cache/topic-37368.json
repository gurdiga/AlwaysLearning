I have even written this email two or three times with differentwords and changed my mind on sending it, thinking that we could be creativeand come up with something ourselves, but I think I need an outside POV.Even writing this email I feel like I am being selfish and that I should beable to come up with a solution.There are 4 of us in our family. DH and I plus Marti (8) and Lilly (almost5). Marti likes playing by herself a lot these days and really likes stayingat home. She rarely willingly likes to go anywhere. The rest of us love tobe out and about. Lilly gets way bored just staying home all the time, as doDH and I. We often find ourselves catering to Marti, but then feeling tornbecause that isn&#39;t fair to the rest of us, especially Lilly. Yesterday, wetook an hour and 15 minute bus ride to a park that we haven&#39;t been to sincelast fall. We were there an hour and Marti wanted to go home. Lilly didn&#39;t.We ended up going home to appease Marti.How do we respect Marti&#39;s needs and still respect Lilly&#39;s needs? I know thatone of us (adults) could stay home with Marti while the other went out withLilly. There are about 3 hours per night that we are all up and here andthat doesn&#39;t include getting dinner. By the time DH gets up (3rd shift)Lilly is already bored to tears. I try to play with her, but she tires of meand I just can&#39;t fulfill her need to play by myself. Marti doesn&#39;t want toplay with her either.Having only three hours also doesn&#39;t leave room for much. Lilly is a varietysnob, lol! If we go to the same place very often she easily gets bored withit and being that we are dependent on the city bus, it takes us up to 4times as long to get someplace as it would if we had a vehicle. That ties upthe 3 hours, and then some.So, on one hand, I have Marti who, it seems, doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere ordo anything. I have even tried &quot;bribing&quot; (although I don&#39;t think of it asbribing), but that only works every so often with her. On the other, I haveLilly who loves to be busy and play. I just can&#39;t seem to do both.
