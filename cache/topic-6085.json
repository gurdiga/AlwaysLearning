Yes, he&#39;s <br/>\nshy. Yes, he squeals in fright a lot and hides...but he&#39;s also friendly and <br/>\ncuddly and loving. He comes out of his cage and runs freely through Conor&#39;s <br/>\nroom. He feeds from my hand and looks forward to our visits. He lets us hold <br/>\nhim and cuddle him and also lets us know when he&#39;s had enough and needs to <br/>\nscamper away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got him a dwarf rabbit as a bunk mate and friend and he has become much <br/>\nmore outgoing and brave. They are a joy to watch together. They both feed on <br/>\nthe guinea pig pellets and whatever fruit and veggie scraps we have on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiggies are GREAT. You just have to understand them and learn to help them <br/>\nbe brave and a little adventurous. Hmmm...I&#39;ve got a kid like that. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"pets...mice, rats","postDate":"1018276907","msgId":6085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1LjFhOTA4ZGJlLjI5ZTMwNjJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6089,"prevInTime":6084,"nextInTime":6086,"topicId":6085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Rats. Rats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had mice (stinky), hamsters (VERY cute and can stuff TONS of food in <br/>\nthose pouches!),  guinea pigs (why bother?), gerbils (too skittish---like, <br/>\nnot quite &quot;domesticated&quot;), rabbits (beautiful and cuddly), and rats. We adore <br/>\nRhia and Olivia. They&#39;re funny, smart, cute, and absolutely delightful!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rat is, by far, the best rodent pet we&#39;ve had. They are terrifically <br/>\nsmart and easy to keep. They come in great exotic colors and coat textures. <br/>\nIf they get out (or someone forgets to put them back in the condo!), they may <br/>\nwander a while, but they either come when called or eventually crawl up your <br/>\nleg for attention. They love to ride in the car!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey eat almost anything. We keep lab blocks in the cage at all times, but <br/>\nthey get pasta and salad and rice and salmon and oranges and nuts <br/>\nand---basically whatever we have, they&#39;ll eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re SO trainable: I hosted a rat class last year---all the kids got <br/>\nratties (the first batch was 15!)---we each got two/three females. The kids <br/>\ntrained their ratties to do rope tricks, play soccer, swim and do water <br/>\ntricks in the tub---among other things. A couple of the children got more <br/>\nrats a few months later. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got them from a couple of breeders in FL. I&#39;d be happy to look in my <br/>\ncontracts for their names and numbers/addresses if you&#39;re interested. They <br/>\nbreed show rats (but ours are not show quality). These breeders handled the <br/>\nbabies from day one. They are VERY well socialized and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some ratlinks:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Florida rat fanciers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flratfanciers.homestead.com/home.html\">http://flratfanciers.homestead.com/home.html</a> <br/>\n    <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.afrma.org/&quot;\">http://www.afrma.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rodentfancy.com/rmfe/index.shtml&quot;\">http://www.rodentfancy.com/rmfe/index.shtml&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: RMFE - RAT and MOUSE FANCIERS for EXCELLENCE&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6082,"nextTopicId":6087}}
