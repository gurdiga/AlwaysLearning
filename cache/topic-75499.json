Helping others is good for further clarifying our own ideas.   So probably I&#39;ve just totally agreed with CASS but there are others who hang around too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are here because they hope for strife.  They like a good car wreck.

That&#39;s fine.  Some wish the discussion was as busy as it used to be.  I would wish so too, if yahoogroups&#39; archives hadn&#39;t become clunky.  They used to be elegant and hard to search.  Now they&#39;re easy to search, but difficult to find the reference and read once you get in there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a subtle complaint.<br/>\n-=- Anytime anyone posts something the more experienced members will point out word choices or ideas that miss the mark.

If someone comes in all wild and prickly, and one of my first thoughts is that I&#39;m going to throw him out if he doesn&#39;t settle (I&#39;ve changed to &quot;he&quot; because a couple of recent melees have involved men), the dissection of the words might be done for the benefit of other readers, so that they can see how far from calm a mass of unclear thoughts (or schoolish thoughts, or negative thoughts) can take a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the clarification is for the benefit of the person who wrote.  Always, secondarily, it&#39;s for the benefit of everyone who&#39;s reading.   And I always remember that new readers don&#39;t know who&#39;s who at all (nor do I, completely, nor can anyone, fully).   Someone who joins today might read something that sounds good to  her, and if the idea isn&#39;t clarified or rearranged in a more unschooling-useful way, she might print it out and put it on the fridge and say it came from the Radical Unschooling discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like for the good ideas to shine, and the bad ideas to be shined up, if possible.

So clarity of thought is a tool to be discovered, built, honed, along the way to understanding unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat tool is useful elsewhere, though. <br/>\nAnd the better and more clearly a

&nbsp;The nuance of language and the underlying thoughts they reveal is an ongoing topic. &nbsp;Words reveal the thoughts behind them and the reason that most of us hang around here is a desire to clarify our thinking. &nbsp;Often newcomers will think it&#39;s nit-picky and will feel offended but, as you pointed out, small changes can make a large impact. &nbsp;Like the idea of &quot;have to&quot; versus &quot;choice&quot;, for example. &nbsp;It sounds like such a simple idea but it is actually quite profound. &nbsp;</span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"

anyone posts something the more experienced members will point out word choices or ideas that miss the mark. &nbsp;It is not done with the intention of insulting the poster, it is done in a spirit of clarification and helpfulness. &nbsp;That&#39;s a big reason why people are asked to observe for awhile before posting. &nbsp;Clarity of thought is the goal &amp; not simply comforting or reassuring

&nbsp;We find that parents are eager to say &quot;yes&quot; to invitations on Fridays. &nbsp;My son has a friend who is usually home alone or with his younger brother on Fridays so he will often text me to see if he can come over (sometimes with the brother). &nbsp;This works out great for us. &nbsp;If my son wants him over I say &quot;yes&quot; and go pick him up. &nbsp;If Ben is not in the mood I just tell him that we&#39;re not available. &nbsp;Both of my kids prefer to have their friends over to our house anyway.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div><span

One couple wanted children and couldn&#39;t have them (pituitary tumor in the female partner—the drugs to keep it from growing would harm a fetus, and stopping the drugs for nine months would let the tumor grow, and it was inoperable).  So being around them with babies seemed cruel, and we needed to find new friends with children anyway.  But we&#39;ve been to their house twice in two months, and Keith&#39;s going over there to watch the super bowl.  So time frames get longer, when you have a project coming up that&#39;s going to last 18 years. :-)  Some of those friend and relatives may come back around, and it might not take as long as you fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n(about picky details of communications)<br/>\n-=- Is it a lack of being truly present in the moment?

The first thing I thought when we left was that I would never put us in that position again.

I don&#39;t like it that I did that - chose to not focus on some things that might create a crappy environment for my kids because I wanted something so bad.

It doesn&#39;t help me to learn to be more attuned to my kids and occasionally (like after this camping adventure) it makes me want to hide away in a cave. I think there may be some relationships in our life that naturally fall away the further we go down this path, but I don&#39;t want to encourage that artificially by making mistakes like I did with the camping thing.

I never thought about the difference between &quot;Stop hitting me&quot; and &quot;Please stop hitting me&quot; - I mean previously I didn&#39;t think/see that the latter left an opening for the child to NOT stop. When compared, I&nbsp;<i>can</i>&nbsp;see how the latter may seem &quot;wimpy&quot; or misleading (i.e. giving the false impression of a choice), but before this time I would have not thought twice about throwing in the &quot;please&quot; (Hmmm, not thinking twice just sounded like a big problem in general, actually... Or maybe it&#39;s not thinking carefully? Knee-jerk please?). It seems like not attaching &quot;ok?&quot; to the end of sentences if it is something there really is no choice about. Before reading this list I might have thought that such a distinction (the please vs no please on the above sentence) was kind of &quot;picky&quot;, but I realize now that it is part of really thinking and speaking clearly. That is, admittedly, hard for me at times - a skill I feel I am from &quot;mastering&quot; but really want to work on because I know it is beneficial to ALL of my relationships.

Up till this point we have had pleasant interactions and enjoyed each other&#39;s company. However, camping together was a totally different experience. They were physically generous, sharing their huge sleeping tent, shade tent, cooking setup, etc. because we have little to no camping gear (an offer they made before the trip), but they were emotionally quite reserved and even distant at times. What we felt happened was that they decided in the first evening of being together that they basically didn&#39;t really like our kids or our parenting style and pretty much kind of ignored our two girls for the rest of the trip (my husband said he even saw his cousin &quot;snarl&quot; at my daughter when she was communicating in a way that he found displeasing).  </div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">They didn&#39;t attempt to play (or otherwise connect) with the kids even once (an idea that I probably should never have had; just because it felt very natural for me to play with their daughter and try to create fun opportunities for all the kids to play together doesn&#39;t mean they will be that way) and at every perceived opportunity gave my husband advice on parenting. His cousin told him that he should be more &quot;assertive&quot; as a father and mentioned the book &quot;Babywise&quot; (&quot;On becoming Babywise&quot;) at least three times. [They actually told us about the book before our first girl was born and I read it, but when she came out I found myself at the Dr. Sears website reading madly because the principles of attachment parenting were what really resonated with me, despite my own mother and grandmother saying things like &quot;If you pick her up every time she cries you&#39;re going to spoil her.&quot; We basically found attachment parenting and never looked back.]</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">One thing that came up that seemed to be a big issue (or I thought so by their body language, looks, and comments at various stages) was that our 3 year-old was &quot;whining&quot;. My husband&#39;s cousin said to my husband that you have to &quot;nip that kind of behavior in the bud.&quot; </div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Lately - like just in the last two weeks - there has become an urgency and emotional bigness to much of her communication. Requests or small things that annoy or frustrate her (a twisted dress strap, the wrong cup, etc.) can come out with a stressful tone and urgency that may seem &quot;unwarranted&quot; from this couple&#39;s perspective, but are her genuine experience at that moment. We have been trying to figure out how to best navigate it, and usually say something like, &quot;Please use your normal voice&quot; or &quot;Take a deep breath and slow down, please, so I can understand you.&quot; If a request is framed like a demand, I usually say &quot;I would appreciate a kind request&quot; or &quot;Can you please ask me in a kind way with a normal voice?&quot; Am I on track with these kinds of responses or is it further screwing things up? Maybe a &quot;normal&quot; voice is too abstract a concept? I feel like calling it whining is coated in judgment and doesn&#39;t help (i.e. it doesn&#39;t felt right to me to say &quot;Stop whining&quot;). Could it be that I am missing other signals and it is a function of needing food or playtime together or something else? Maybe feeling uncomfortable in a new environment? </div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Because it is such recent behavior, we are still trying to get a handle on dealing with it, but I didn&#39;t feel it was so frequent or intense that it should ruin their holiday. I felt like every time she &quot;whined&quot; I had to have some response that was going to make them happy (because we were basically in &quot;their&quot; space). It felt as though we were under a microscope and that was a really stressful experience. Sharing such an intimate space can be tough, but it can also be joyful. It didn&#39;t feel like they brought much joy to the table. What I have read about brain development says that the emotional part of the brain is really growing from around 3-5, so I feel like this kind of behavior is fairly &quot;normal&quot; or age-appropriate. Is that totally off? I understand it was annoying for them, but I don&#39;t think intolerance helps anyone learn or feel happy or peaceful.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">This piece from Sandra really made me think:</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">- - IF (just if) your regular mode of communication is to coat words in words and then have introductory phrases, that will very likely cause children not to understand you, first of all; not to take you seriously; and eventually not to listen to you. - - </div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">I think I do this - use too many words sometimes - and I am trying to get better about simplifying communication. I also feel like it is important to empathize with where she is at, yet that can seem long-winded at times. Is that best saved for a later, more quiet moment? Maybe some of the other communication that this couple heard us using seemed long-winded (i.e. &quot;unassertive&quot;) and that is why the cousin made the comment re assertiveness? I am not so much concerned about what they think as I am about whether we are handling things in a way that is helping her (and not just to make that moment easier, but to help with future communication).</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">I don&#39;t want to take up more space listing all the rings that happened during the trip that I found upsetting, suffice to say that their vibe was different - not as friendly or easygoing as usual, and at times quite stressed out. I felt like my kids were an annoyance to them and that they felt we were really screwing up as parents. I don&#39;t place a lot of stock in their opinions, but the experience has made me not want to be around them. I am not sure how to proceed from here. I feel like it would be awkward to have no contact, but the things we experienced (again, too many to innumerate here) made me want to keep my children away from them. They are family and it could easily get awkward with the wider family if we didn&#39;t figure out a good way of handling it.

I feel like calling it whining is coated in judgment and doesn&#39;t help (i.e. it doesn&#39;t felt right to me to say &quot;Stop whining&quot;). Could it be that I am missing other signals and it is a function of needing food or playtime together or something else? Maybe feeling uncomfortable in a new environment? -=-<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nWhen my ids were receptive and not really truly upset but just whining casually, I sometimes used the same tone and whined back.  That&#39;s how they got the difference in the tone. I would say (in the same whiney voice) something like &quot;I don&#39;t KNOW why it&#39;s raining,&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t understand you very well when you WHIIINE.&quot;  ONLY when it could be fun and funny and light.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nI do agree that if parents never say anything about it and don&#39;t distinguish between mature communication and babyish, that it can cause a child to be babyish more and longer than they might otherwise be.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nBut as to sharing a tent, I&#39;m surprised you ever thought it could possibly be a good idea.

That&#39;s how they got the difference in the tone. I would say (in the same whiney voice) something like &quot;I don&#39;t KNOW why it&#39;s raining,&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t understand you very well when you WHIIINE.&quot;  ONLY when it could be fun and funny and light.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that if parents never say anything about it and don&#39;t distinguish between mature communication and babyish, that it can cause a child to be babyish more and longer than they might otherwise be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to sharing a tent, I&#39;m surprised you ever thought it could possibly be a good idea.  So the FIRST thing to learn from that is not to get your family into a situation where you can&#39;t withdraw and be alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeals with relatives, for a while?  Restaurants—not your house, not their house.  Holidays?  Get a motel room.  Show up early!  Stay late!

Up till this point we have had pleasant interactions and enjoyed each other&#39;s company. However, camping together was a totally different experience. They were physically generous, sharing their huge sleeping tent, shade tent, cooking setup, etc. because we have little to no camping gear (an offer they made before the trip), but they were emotionally quite reserved and even distant at times. What we felt happened was that they decided in the first evening of being together that they basically didn&#39;t really like our kids or our parenting style and pretty much kind of ignored our two girls for the rest of the trip (my husband said he even saw his cousin &quot;snarl&quot; at my daughter when she was communicating in a way that he found displeasing). &nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">They didn&#39;t attempt to play (or otherwise connect) with the kids even once (an idea that I probably should never have had; just because it felt very natural for me to play with their daughter and try to create fun opportunities for all the kids to play together doesn&#39;t mean they will be that way) and at every perceived opportunity gave my husband advice on parenting. His cousin told him that he should be more &quot;assertive&quot; as a father and mentioned the book &quot;Babywise&quot; (&quot;On becoming Babywise&quot;) at least three times. [They actually told us about the book before our first girl was born and I read it, but when she came out I found myself at the Dr. Sears website reading madly because the principles of attachment parenting were what really resonated with me, despite my own mother and grandmother saying things like &quot;If you pick her up every time she cries you&#39;re going to spoil her.&quot; We basically found attachment parenting and never looked back.]</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">One thing that came up that seemed to be a big issue (or I thought so by their body language, looks, and comments at various stages) was that our 3 year-old was &quot;whining&quot;. My husband&#39;s cousin said to my husband that you have to &quot;nip that kind of behavior in the bud.&quot;&nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">Lately - like just in the last two weeks - there has become an urgency and emotional bigness to much of her communication. Requests or small things that annoy or frustrate her (a twisted dress strap, the wrong cup, etc.) can come out with a stressful tone and urgency that may seem &quot;unwarranted&quot; from this couple&#39;s perspective, but are her genuine experience at that moment. We have been trying to figure out how to best navigate it, and usually say something like, &quot;Please use your normal voice&quot; or &quot;Take a deep breath and slow down, please, so I can understand you.&quot; If a request is framed like a demand, I usually say &quot;I would appreciate a kind request&quot; or &quot;Can you please ask me in a kind way with a normal voice?&quot; Am I on track with these kinds of responses or is it further screwing things up? Maybe a &quot;normal&quot; voice is too abstract a concept? I feel like calling it whining is coated in judgment and doesn&#39;t help (i.e. it doesn&#39;t felt right to me to say &quot;Stop whining&quot;). Could it be that I am missing other signals and it is a function of needing food or playtime together or something else? Maybe feeling uncomfortable in a new environment?&nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">Because it is such recent behavior, we are still trying to get a handle on dealing with it, but I didn&#39;t feel it was so frequent or intense that it should ruin their holiday. I felt like every time she &quot;whined&quot; I had to have some response that was going to make them happy (because we were basically in &quot;their&quot; space). It felt as though we were under a microscope and that was a really stressful experience. Sharing such an intimate space can be tough, but it can also be joyful. It didn&#39;t feel like they brought much joy to the table. What I have read about brain development says that the emotional part of the brain is really growing from around 3-5, so I feel like this kind of behavior is fairly &quot;normal&quot; or age-appropriate. Is that totally off? I understand it was annoying for them, but I don&#39;t think intolerance helps anyone learn or feel happy or peaceful.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\">This piece from Sandra really made me think:</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\">- - IF (just if) your regular mode of communication is to coat words in words and then have introductory phrases, that will very likely cause children not to understand you, first of all; not to take you seriously; and eventually not to listen to you. - -&nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">I think I do this - use too many words sometimes - and I am trying to get better about simplifying communication. I also feel like it is important to empathize with where she is at, yet that can seem long-winded at times. Is that best saved for a later, more quiet moment? Maybe some of the other communication that this couple heard us using seemed long-winded (i.e. &quot;unassertive&quot;) and that is why the cousin made the comment re assertiveness? I am not so much concerned about what they think as I am about whether we are handling things in a way that is helping her (and not just to make that moment easier, but to help with future communication).</div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\">I don&#39;t want to take up more space listing all the rings that happened during the trip that I found upsetting, suffice to say that their vibe was different - not as friendly or easygoing as usual, and at times quite stressed out. I felt like my kids were an annoyance to them and that they felt we were really screwing up as parents. I don&#39;t place a lot of stock in their opinions, but the experience has made me not want to be around them. I am not sure how to proceed from here. I feel like it would be awkward to have no contact, but the things we experienced (again, too many to innumerate here) made me want to keep my children away from them. They are family and it could easily get awkward with the wider family if we didn&#39;t figure out a good way of handling it.
