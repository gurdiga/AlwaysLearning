And poor husband said almost word for word what I&#39;m feeling...we are to the point we don&#39;t want to hear their lovely little voices anymore.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an idea for you having to do with mindfulness.  First, I don’t think you’re listening to their lovely little voices, I think you’re listening to the voice in your own head in a way that’s causing you to be judgmental and unhappy.   Since you mention Jon Kabat-Zinn I’ll suggest trying to cultivate that quality of mind which will let you experience your real life in a way that doesn’t leave you judging it.  The danger of making a judgment like  “not ...any time for me anymore” is that you begin to find ways to qualify that so that anything your kids want from then on will seem like too much.  Maybe you can revisit Jon Kabat-Zinn.    <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you’re really listening to your kids and not your sense of injustice I think you’ll find that answering them and interacting with them is intellectually rewarding and stimulating and fun.  It’s not something you *have* to do.  It’s something you *get* to do for a very little while.   You can’t change this need your kids have right now.  You can only change how you see it, how you think about it and meet it.  And  that’s good because that’s entirely in your power to do.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was little and I was home with him all the time two things helped.   I’d get up early and go for a run before David went to work and I’d get outside with Dylan to play and run around as much as possible.   Dylan talked early and talked a lot and many of his games involved me taking direction and delivering dialog like an actor in a play.   There isn’t much time for thinking your own thoughts when you’re talking to Space Command, trying to outrun Interpol, and smuggle monster back to Monster Island.   But that was as rewarding and fun for me as it was for him.  More, maybe because I still remember it and mostly he doesn’t. &lt;g&gt;     Really focusing on him though, was the most important thing.  Really living those monster stories instead of thinking how much I’d like a shower, really listening to his little voice instead of thinking about how long it will take to get the dishes done, that made all the difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Help we&#39;re sinking&quot;","postDate":"1316290564","msgId":62959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1MnY2NCtvcGZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVBQUJFNDE5LUVCQzUtNDQ0My04OEVFLTJBQjlFMTVFMjZCMkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62950,"nextInTopic":62961,"prevInTime":62958,"nextInTime":62960,"topicId":62950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There&#39;s a game called &quot;dead lions&quot; that can be fun, but involves some quiet.  Not total quiet, but it might be a start.   Watching videos that aren&#39;t raucous, but have nice music and pretty scenery might be a way to move from constant chatter to less.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids are asking questions, you could practice giving short answers.  One, three, five-word answers, rather than wikipedia-type responses.  Elegant, profound answers.  Or fantasy answers, like &quot;I WISH the answer were... &quot; and spin a little fantasy.

We knew a family that moved 50 miles from the city because the mom was attached to the idea of having chickens and a horse and a pig.  Thing is, where they moved wasn&#39;t really great for the horse or the pig--no shade, no grass, no natural water.  And she spent nearly every day driving one of her three kids to Albuquerque, through a mountain pass that wasn&#39;t always safe or open.  MANY times she could have stayed in town, but there was nobody out there to feed her animals, so she had to drive back in the dark, late, or the animals went hungry.  It would have been much, much safer and less expensive for her to choose her children&#39;s needs over her personal belief that it would be good for them to grow up with farm animals.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Just some ideas or how others or your self got through the very needful times...

You imagined a bank, and you imagined yourself poor.  Your words have made you less than human.   Those words came from your thoughts.  Recast your thoughts in different words or images:  You are the mother of two children bright and energetic enough to ask you questions!  You have a husband who loves you, who talks to you about important things, who loves your children.  You have an intact family, living in a home you love.  Look around you.  You&#39;re in the minority.   Look for what you have, and what your resources are for having more [emotionally, visually, auditorially (?)]  What can you taste or smell today that would make the day a little better?  Where is your abundance?  What do you have plenty of? <br/>\n<br/>\nLook at what you do have, and you won&#39;t have time or energy to focus so closely on what you imagine others have that you don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou ARE human.
