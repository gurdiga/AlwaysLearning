Yes. To learn naturally as a part of living life? Yes. Her needs are going to be more intense in some ways, but not fundamentally different from the needs of other humans. She&#39;ll probably need to &quot;deschool&quot; in some ways much much longer than others and need more help for longer. It might help you keep the idea of learning, and what sorts of things support natural learning, in the front of your mind. Here&#39;s a handy link for that:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She would be perfectly happy to keep me all to herself. Is there a way to form appropriate attachment? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, she doesn&#39;t need an &quot;appropriate attachment&quot; so much as a re-do of her early childhood - and that&#39;s rough, especially as you have other kids. Do you co-sleep at all? That&#39;s something which could help her, if she&#39;s interested. But besides looking for ways to help her feel more loved and connected, it&#39;s good to realize you may never be able to fill her all the way up -that&#39;s one way of thinking about what it means to have an attachment disorder. You don&#39;t get &quot;perfect&quot; you get to help, you get to move things closer to fine than otherwise. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something I think about with Ray from time to time. He doesn&#39;t have attachment issues, but he does have big holes in his life. Now and then, when I&#39;m really down about how less-than-ideal his life is, it helps me to stop and consider what his life might have been without unschooling - and since I have a few years of homeschool and school to use as a comparison, it&#39;s really easy for me to see that we&#39;ve done a whole lot to make his life much, much better than it would have been.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;this new therapist... explains how if I control everything for my daughter she will learn to control herself.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one where it helps to step away from the word &quot;control&quot; and consider the principles behind what the therapist is saying. People like regularity. People like patterns. People like to feel safe and secure. In conventional parenting, &quot;control&quot; creates regular patterns and a sense of safety. The downside is that controlling another person makes it harder for that person to learn to make thoughtful choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nNotice what helps your daughter feel a sense of predictability and safety. Look for ways to offer her more of those things. When Ray was younger, it helped him to have meals and snacks at regular intervals - above and beyond having food available, it helped him have a *routine* . So I created a routine of regular meals and snacks around his natural rhythms. That helped me get breaks from running around, it helped him have a sense of predictability, and it helped keep him from getting stressed from running low on fuel. I created the routine, but it wasn&#39;t randomly assigned times, it was times which worked for Ray. Similarly, Ray had a hard time searching for things - he&#39;d melt down if he couldn&#39;t find things easily. So I made sure his things and things he&#39;d want to look for (movies, snacks, etc) easy to find by keeping them organized and put away. It was a little more work at first, but compared to dealing with Ray melting down... no, it was waaaay less work than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, from the outside, that could look like &quot;structure&quot; or &quot;control&quot; but it was done in response to his actual needs, not based on a theory of what &quot;kids like him&quot; needed. And it wasn&#39;t about controlling Him so much as making the environment friendly and easier for him to navigate so he had less stress in his life. He didn&#39;t have a stress-free life because at that time we had a 50/50 custody split so he was going back and forth from our house to a very chaotic situation where he didn&#39;t always know where he was going to sleep and when or where he would eat. But by making One home predictable and reassuring, he was less stressed overall and could manage the rest of his life more easily. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a different situation from your daughter, but the principles are still the same. You Can&#39;t make her whole life easy and predictable and secure - in part because of her past. But making things predictable, helping her have a sense of the patterns in part of her life will make it easier for her to handle the rest. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327852347,"authorName":"Tress Miles","from":"Tress Miles &lt;milesdt@...&gt;","profile":"abacaxi7476","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Attachment and radical unschooling","postDate":"1333550090","msgId":66553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRkxLeTMzPT1WaUMrVjBISDZTZXd2Ml9RTFc0Yy1rVGpOSm1UNi1XK1B2VkRkZU9QQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsZGs3cCs2dTJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpsZGs3cCs2dTJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66541,"nextInTopic":66554,"prevInTime":66552,"nextInTime":66554,"topicId":66538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Tiffani, I have a 9 year old adopted daughter with attachment issues.
