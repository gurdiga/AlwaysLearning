We each have times we would rather be home than anywhere else. But my kids will often jump at the chance to do something fun as a family. Having their Dad around, or going with another family, adds a component of enjoyment to activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it can be difficult to see the value of being at home. If you or your husband believe learning happens outside the home, this is something to explore as you deschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are so many fun things to do at home. Someone recently shared these with us:<br/>\nhttp://www. Pixelpapercrafts.com<br/>\nHttp://www.instructables.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-minecraft-papercrafts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the other fun things we do at home -<br/>\n&quot;Painting day&quot; where we each paint on stretched canvas or decent quality watercolor paper.<br/>\nBoard games<br/>\nBuilding things with Legos or boxes or playdoh or magnetic kits or wood, hammer, nails<br/>\nBaking and cooking<br/>\nVegetable garden and yard work<br/>\nMinecraft!<br/>\nSkyping with friends<br/>\nCreating Let&#39;s Play videos and posting to YouTube<br/>\nPlaying Barbies (sometimes these are recorded and sent to YouTube also)<br/>\nSewing with the machine<br/>\nSwinging in the tree swing<br/>\nRiding bikes<br/>\nPlaying with the hose and buckets (with or without washing the car)<br/>\nWatching tv or movies or YouTube<br/>\nWalking the dog<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there is so much to explore at home, it might not seem necessary to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRead a little about Learn Nothing Day. It is something that reminds me how learning works and helps me see the connections my kids are making all the time. (Sometimes we plan our own &quot;unofficial&quot; Learn Nothing Day at other times of the year so we can all affirm how we are learning all the time.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not getting out much","postDate":"1401415275","msgId":74364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyNUIwODYyLTYzRDUtNDU5Mi1CMzYwLUI4RDBEOTE1RkY2N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQ00tMVlWOE5TNUZSMDQ0V3hBNnhLTS05MWdHPWV4TnNmQjZTX0t5cGVyRzRkeGV5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQ00tMVlWTVFHMlBGb0QwWG8zcHFVempMNHNudUhReEgtUVh5cXA3cVpELTZ5dnVSUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENBQ00tMVlWOE5TNUZSMDQ0V3hBNnhLTS05MWdHPWV4TnNmQjZTX0t5cGVyRzRkeGV5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74363,"nextInTopic":74365,"prevInTime":74363,"nextInTime":74365,"topicId":74363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- My husband wants me to do more outside things with them and I always offer but -=- What kinds of things?
