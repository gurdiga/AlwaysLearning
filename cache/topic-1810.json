They<br/>\nhad a good time!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie made the effort to drive from her MIL on St<br/>\nSimon Island in Georgia down to MY HOUSE just north of<br/>\nJacksonville yesterday. Julie lives in Texas! We were<br/>\nSO excited anticipating their arrival...and then they<br/>\ndid! Julie has five adopted children.  She brought the<br/>\ntwo older ones Adrian, 11, and Zack, 8, with her.  It<br/>\nwas so GOOD.  Roy is 8 and never met any unschoolers. <br/>\nAll of the kids had attended school at one point, so<br/>\nthey even had that in common.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was so worried as my house looked like 52-card<br/>\npick-up, and the $%#@^%$&% MS has been bothering me,<br/>\nbut Julie quickly reassured me.  Zack and Roy wandered<br/>\naround inside and outside and did little boy stuff. <br/>\nRoy was so delighted to have a BOY, not just Mama to<br/>\ndo things with.  Roy is NOT a loner, as I have always<br/>\nbeen.  It was easy to see that we did things way<br/>\ndifferent than at Julie&#39;s house, but she made it OK. <br/>\nWe even play &quot;Sorry&quot; different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would sure be fun if lots of us could get<br/>\ntogether....there is space here (29 acres...pristine<br/>\nriver to swim, depending on weather and floods, etc)<br/>\nto camp out.  May would be a good time.....before it<br/>\ngets too hot here. Indoor plumbing :) electricity.<br/>\nFirewood....unless there has been a drought at that<br/>\ntime and there is a temporary burn ban....but we do<br/>\nhave a kitchen and on the porch a fish cooker....<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of us are trying to arrange to get together,<br/>\nabout then, but the more the merrier.  Everyone wants<br/>\nto go to the conference in October, including<br/>\nme....but that is such a long time away! This would be<br/>\nfor the children. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone thinks it might be fun  or that it would be<br/>\nparticularly not fun, please e back. Travel would be<br/>\nthe biggest expense.  Which is a problem for lots.

The 1/8&quot; plug goes into the sound input jack (on the iMac it has a<br/>\npicture of a microphone next to it). The RCA plugs go into the back of the<br/>\nHiFi. The receptacle should be labeled &quot;Rec Out&quot; or &quot;Line Out.&quot; If you&#39;re<br/>\nbuying a second hand turntable be sure that your HiFi has a &quot;Phono&quot; input<br/>\nThe turntable needs that kind of input to sound correct.  Some Hifi&#39;s make<br/>\nyou select what is being recorded, if that is the case, set it to phono.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe software you need comes with Roxio Toast Titanium 5.0.1. This is a<br/>\ndifferent version of Toast that is usually included with a CD writer. The<br/>\nsoftware for recording from LPs or cassettes to your computer is &quot;Spin<br/>\nDoctor&quot;, and it is in the &quot;Roxio Music&quot; folder of the Roxio Toast program.<br/>\nBe sure to set the input in the Input menu to &quot;Sound In.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe software has fairly clear instructions on how to record the music to the<br/>\ncomputer using pop and rumble filters to get rid of unwanted LP noise, how<br/>\nto delineate individual songs as tracks, to name them and to transfer them<br/>\nto the Toast software that writes the CD.  The package also has software to<br/>\nprint labels and duplicate CDs.  Once it&#39;s all set up it&#39;s way easier than<br/>\nwriting out this post&lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your iMac doesn&#39;t have that &quot;mic&quot; jack on the side, it gets much more<br/>\ncomplicated. But Input devices that utilize the USB buss are made.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a Windoze user, Roxio&#39;s product is Easy CD Creator.
