That doesn&#39;t mean you have to forbid other rap music, but if socially conscience rap is available (and just as good, some of it better in some cases IMHO) then why not present it to them.  They might prefer it as well.  You won&#39;t know until you expose them to it.  A lot of the rap of the 80&#39;s is much more socially aware and has less of the bump and grind element.  A lot of it does have to do with drugs and appalling living conditions, but that could open up some interesting discussions.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Chuck D (formerly of Public Enemy) is a rapper with an environmental and political conscience.  Although, he does swear a lot &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kanye West and Common also have positive messages.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Daara J is a rap group from Dakar in Senegal has a social conscience.  Their album is called, &quot;Global Hip Hop: Beats and Rhymes--The Nu World Culture&quot;.  You&#39;d probably find it in the world music section.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Afrika Bambaataa was one of the first rappers to put politics in his music (he sampled Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Malcom X in songs).  He was around in the 80&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s done anything current.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It would also be worth checking out some of the female rap artists like Queen Latifah (most of her rap was from &#39;88 to &#39;98).  I don&#39;t really know much about other female rap artists.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I would say, let this be an adventure and learning experience for all of you.  Try it out, if something you listen to is offensive to you, tell your girls that and explain why it offends you.  Again this could open doors to some amazing discussions and growth.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Have fun with it,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Meghan<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNow that&#39;s room service!

It is possible to rap and do hip hop without being racist and denigrating women.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There&#39;s A Tribe Called Quest, Common, Mos Def, The Coup, Nas, and many others.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Of course, if you also object to lots of swearing, then you might have a more difficult time.  I never had a problem with strong language around my kids (I cuss like a sailor myself), but I understand that other parents do.  I myself never censored my daughters&#39; music--and when my oldest was a teenager she really stretched the limits of my tolerance!

I¹m thinking that¹s what I should do.  They¹re not<br/>\ninterested in any particular group, they mostly want dance music (they love<br/>\nthe show ³so you think you can dance² ).  Part of me wants to ³protect² them<br/>\nfrom it.... gawd... even as I write this it feels so false and ridiculous.<br/>\nI¹m thinking that the whole ³nasty hip-hop² theme is similar to gaming and<br/>\nunlimited TV.... hmmm... I guess just placing the question on paper is<br/>\nprompting all sorts of discussions in my mind.  So with that I¹m guessing<br/>\nthat getting them what they want will at one point spark very interesting<br/>\nconversations about misogyny, the use of swear words, perhaps a whole<br/>\ndigging into the hip-hop culture.....<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps true protection comes with knowledge and free choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny views would be helpful though.  Perhaps I¹m not seeing something I need<br/>\nto be looking at.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nVida<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28995,"nextTopicId":29047}}
