Here were some of my instructions.  The topic is to <br/>\ndescribe different styles of homeschooling.

(If you&#39;re not interested, sorry for the not-just-unschooling <br/>\npost.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier I had this, but it was softened somewhat.

In answer to your <br/>\nquestions, I did not get an attachment so I don’t know what tone you were <br/>\nusing.  We were shooting for an authoritative tone, but not harsh or ‘know it <br/>\nall’ in style.  We really want to make sure that there are professional <br/>\nreferences included, as the audience we are targeting is composed of people <br/>\nthat value research and such…&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[my draft is only 824 words, so there&#39;s room to beef up]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think the main thing to remember is that the audience may know nothing <br/>\nabout homeschooling, may be resistant to wanting to understand homeschooling, <br/>\nand may actually be attempting to prosecute a homeschooling family.

It can be a challenging way <br/>\nto have to think while writing because it may seem so foreign...you may want <br/>\nto consider it like drafting text for a school textbook on <br/>\nhomeschooling...sort of like you have a section of a chapter to write.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are walking a fine line because the targeted audience will have degrees <br/>\nand feel like their opinions on homeschooling are correct (because of their <br/>\neducation), but many have a somewhat negative view of homeschooling....most <br/>\nof which actually comes from lack of knowledge about it (in my opinion and <br/>\nexperience, at least).  No educator is taught about homeschooling unless they <br/>\nhave gone to the most alternative of schools---and even then I have only seen <br/>\nhomeschooling briefly addressed in university curriculum.  So, we need to <br/>\ngive it to them simply, and quickly, but with a strong infrastructure of <br/>\nresearch and support wherever possible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------DRAFT by Sandra is below -----------------------------<br/>\n(comments are welcome--please!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMethods of Homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling methods cover the same range educational theory does, in that <br/>\nsome believe strongly in &quot;the three R&#39;s&quot; as the frontline of their efforts, <br/>\nand others lean more toward deductive reasoning and &quot;learning to learn.&quot;  <br/>\nThis range of choices is a great advantage to homeschoolers, because each <br/>\nfamily and each learner can eventually discover which method works best for <br/>\ntheir personalities, learning styles, talents and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most structured homeschooling situation involves a purchased curriculum, <br/>\nused on a school-style schedule.  The oldest of these is The Calvert School, <br/>\npurchased by the school year and by individual grade.  Once for missionaries&#39; <br/>\nchildren and the bedridden, it comes with all necessary supplies, including <br/>\npencils.   Two in current use are Abeka and Sonlight, both with a Protestant <br/>\nChristian point of view.  Seton is a popular Catholic curriculum.  For older <br/>\nstudents, The American School is sometimes employed.  The same curriculum <br/>\nonce advertised on matchbook folders for returning GI&#39;s  in the 1950&#39;s and <br/>\n60&#39;s, it is one way to obtain a high school diploma.  There are several other <br/>\ncurriculæ on the market as well as online courses. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome families design their own curriculum, mixing and matching different <br/>\nsources, perhaps using a purchased math series, but designing their own <br/>\nliterature courses and using a history overview such as The History of US, or <br/>\nother such summaries.  In this way the child goes at his own pace through <br/>\nmaterials and the families supplements as interest and need dictate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage is that it looks like school.  For many children that is also <br/>\nthe disadvantage, if school&#39;s methods are not suited to their learning style. <br/>\n And another disadvantage is it takes learning designed for large groups and <br/>\napplies it to one child, which is not usually an efficient use of time and <br/>\neffort in a home environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA less linear and more intensive  method is &quot;unit studies.&quot;    Units can be <br/>\npurchased or downloaded from the internet, or easily designed by parents.  <br/>\nWith unit studies, a subject such as &quot;Japan&quot; or &quot;whales&quot;  is chosen, and the <br/>\nstudent explores the history, geography, literature and science regarding the <br/>\ntopic, working in mathematics and writing about aspects of this study, in <br/>\norder to simultaneously study a particular subject and exercise the various <br/>\ndisciplines the parent wishes to teach.  With unit studies, art and music are <br/>\neasily incorporated.  Units typically last a week or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThematic studies are common at many alternative schools of late.  While <br/>\nsimilar to unit studies, a theme such as &quot;treasure&quot; or &quot;families&quot; is the <br/>\nfocus of inquiry for a month or more, and are easy to adapt to a <br/>\nhomeschooling situation.  Sometimes classic literature provides the base <br/>\ntheme, as advocated by Charlotte Mason&#39;s methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth unit studies and thematic studies can be used with children of different <br/>\nages and  abilities simultaneously, which is a great advantage to children <br/>\nlearning together without the limits of &quot;grade levels&quot; to the advantage of <br/>\nall the learners and facilitators.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome homeschoolers say they are using a &quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; method, by <br/>\nwhich they mean they are picking and choosing from the methods above as suits <br/>\neach child&#39;s strengths and learning style.  The flexibility of being able to <br/>\nfocus on the learner instead of the material itself is the greatest benefit <br/>\nof homeschooling, and once the parents gain confidence in their child&#39;s <br/>\nleaning, both child and parent can adapt learning to their everyday lives in <br/>\na way schools dream of doing, but homeschoolers can actually accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate dream of educators was once called &quot;the open classroom.&quot;  When <br/>\napplied to homeschooling, it is also known as &quot;natural learning,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;interest-based learning&quot; or for those who come to this method by the <br/>\nwritings of John Holt, &quot;unschooling.&quot;  This is similar to unit studies, <br/>\nwithout having clearly delineated units.  A child&#39;s interest in Mongol tribes <br/>\nmight last his whole life, with him coming back to that and building on it <br/>\nwhenever opportunity arises.   If one has a fascination with flight, the <br/>\nparents will encourage that as long as the interest is strong, and be willing <br/>\nto drop it or return to it a month or two years later, while other interests <br/>\nare interwoven, and parents learn to see the learning opportunities in both <br/>\nspecial and common everyday activities, rather than separating &quot;schooltime&quot; <br/>\nfrom living.   With natural learning, summer and vacations are often the <br/>\nrichest learning seasons, and it doesn&#39;t matter what grade a child would be <br/>\nin if he were in school.  He learns every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage is that an enriched life becomes the classroom and the <br/>\ndisadvantage is that outsiders find it harder to see the learning as it <br/>\nhappens.   While this method rarely worked in public school settings,  it can <br/>\nwork given the real world as the open classroom. With the state of the <br/>\ninternet, video information, and the easy availability of a quality and <br/>\nquantity of excellently illustrated books never imagined thirty years ago, <br/>\nthe world is accessible to people as never before.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11692,"nextTopicId":11654}}
