I was Alexandria Julianne Ramsay, AKA Alec.  We owned horse farms and raced in the major horse races.  We WERE these people, we played this game with model horses, bikes, pretend horses.  We rode horses to school (our bikes), we rode pretend horses around the neighborhood and playground, we raced them in the Kentucky Derby (I won once).  All this stemmed from the Black Stallion books.  We also read and reenacted Star Wars a dozen or more times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the same thing with TV.  I pretended I was in Battlestar Galactica (the original TV series), all kinds of pretend play.  There were other shows, of course, but I remember that one &#39;cause I saved up my money and bought a cardboard replica of the control system of a fighter to play with in my room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son pretends to be a Baby Blue Girl Kitty.  Last year it was more often and more intense, we called him by that name, I spoke to him in meows as well as human speech.  He has been a Spider Rider, Kung Fu Panda, the Avatar, pokemon, and more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I am grown up I do role playing games. I think of it as a way for me to try out different aspects of my personality that I do not get to access as much in daily life.  Seriously, how much use do I have for a Mobster or a Tesla-Welder wielding master lockpicker and thief in real life?  Not much, but they sure are fun to be for pretend.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin K. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed cash?

So this year I have tried unschooling with her and she is just not interested in anything other than watching tv or movies. I am at a lost with her. I have even bought educational movies but she knows what I am trying to do and doesnt want to watch it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;tiffermomof5&quot; &lt;tiffermom@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I copied this from a post back in Oct 08.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; YES, unschooling would be great for a child who is for whatever<br/>\n&gt; reasons &quot;behind the curve&quot; in some area, but the parent can&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; utter the word &quot;unschooling&quot; and expect the child to change and start<br/>\n&gt; learning all kinds of cool things on her own.

The preteen years are a time of transition between kid interests  <br/>\nand more grow up interests. TV and video games and what looks like  <br/>\nvery &quot;shallow&quot; interests like fashion and beauty and pre-teen social  <br/>\ninteractions (like in the Nickelodeon and Disney shows) seem to fit  <br/>\ntheir needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t last forever! (Or at least not in that form.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best thing you can do is step back away from trying to mold  <br/>\nor steer her and be a friend. Find out what she likes about her  <br/>\nfavorite programs. Just ask conversationally. Don&#39;t look for her to  <br/>\nconvince you they&#39;re worthwhile! She&#39;s already showing you by  <br/>\nwatching them that they are worthwhile to the person she is at this  <br/>\ntime. Watch some with her so you know who the characters are and  <br/>\ntheir relationships with each other so you&#39;ll understand when she  <br/>\ntells you something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am wondering if I<br/>\n&gt; completely let go and embrace her television watching will she get  <br/>\n&gt; lost<br/>\n&gt; in there?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only kids I&#39;ve known who got lost in TV were the ones who used it  <br/>\nas an escape from life. If she feels you&#39;re someone she wants to  <br/>\nescape from -- critical, watching and judging what she does (even in  <br/>\nsilence), pulling or pushing her to do something else -- she could  <br/>\nretreat to the TV where she&#39;s accepted for who she is, where her  <br/>\nhumor and interests are fed and supported and she&#39;s not seen as not  <br/>\nas good as her brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(You may not put it into words like that but if she&#39;s ever heard an  <br/>\nencouraging tone in your voice when the boys asked to do something  <br/>\nand a sigh or a flat okay when she wants to do something (when you  <br/>\nwished she&#39;d pick something that seemed more worthy of her time) then  <br/>\nshe knows. Kids pick up a huge amount from tone and body language  <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re saying.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She is supper sweet to little kids, she<br/>\n&gt; wants to be a teenager but she pesters them so much they get  <br/>\n&gt; annoyed and<br/>\n&gt; she does not seem to fit in with kids near her age.

She&#39;s in between child and teen and doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nfit into either camp at the moment. Teachers will tell you the  <br/>\npreteen years are a holding pen. ;-) They really don&#39;t know what to  <br/>\ndo with middle schoolers because they&#39;re all over the board in  <br/>\ninterests and abilities so it&#39;s hard to reach them. So it&#39;s not  <br/>\nunusual that preteens wouldn&#39;t be able to relate to each other. (And  <br/>\nschooled teens don&#39;t want &quot;kids&quot; hanging around so it would be an  <br/>\nunusually socially savvy preteen who could fit in.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My biggest problem is parenting my daughter.<br/>\n&gt; We are SO different.

By joining her and exploring  <br/>\nit with her, at least enough to have a conversation with her. What if  <br/>\nshe were into motocross or rodeos or existential plays or Mandarin  <br/>\npoetry or ... How would you support those interests that were far  <br/>\noutside your own?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect your fear that if you support &quot;shallow, unworthy&quot; interests  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll be creating a shallow person might be getting in your way of  <br/>\nembracing them. What you&#39;re in effect doing, though, is driving her  <br/>\nto them because those outlets support who she is when you don&#39;t.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re feeling more like a friend than you are. That sounds harsh  <br/>\nbut she can only react to how she feels not how you want her to feel  <br/>\nor how you want her to understand how you feel. If the TV is feeling  <br/>\nmore supportive and friendly, it&#39;s where she&#39;ll turn for comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":352545834,"authorName":"tiffermomof5","from":"&quot;tiffermomof5&quot; &lt;tiffermom@...&gt;","profile":"tiffermomof5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Learning to unschool a large family","postDate":"1250750077","msgId":46842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg2aXFwdCsxMGZsMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46843,"prevInTime":46841,"nextInTime":46843,"topicId":46842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I copied this from a post back in Oct 08.
