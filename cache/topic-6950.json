If you have a barn full <br/>\nof hay or live in wet woods (also rare) you might get them.  I pulled dozens <br/>\nof ticks out of cats&#39; ears when we got barn-kittens a couple of years ago.  <br/>\nWe might find one on the dog once in a while if we&#39;ve been to the mountains <br/>\nfor a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo earthquakes or volcanos expected.
