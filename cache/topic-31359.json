Eg: <br/>\n&quot;Are her lips pointed? No. Make them rounded and soft&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, Jayn did a couple of drawings following the instructions and then <br/>\ndecided herself that she preferred to just look at the characters and do her <br/>\nown drawing. She felt that her results from her own techniques were better <br/>\nand more in tune with her creative vision. And tbh I think her own drawings <br/>\nhave a lot more life in them than the structured ones from following the <br/>\ninstructions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case she didn&#39;t take the book as a criticism, but I have noticed in <br/>\ngeneral that she prefers her own method to any kind of intructional thing, <br/>\neven though she will often give the thing a try. For example she watched a <br/>\nperson doing fabric painting and making illustrated pillows on a craft show, <br/>\nand then drew a couple of her own renditions on paper to try out the style. <br/>\nBut her purpose in watching such craft shows is to be inspired, not because <br/>\nshe or I or anyone else in her life see her as somehow lacking something.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery now and then when we are at the bookstore I will come upon an art book <br/>\nand show it to her. Also we get several magazines that are about her <br/>\ninterests - Art Doll Quarterly, Doll Crafter, Haute Doll etc - which <br/>\nsometime feature how to&#39;s, plus the couple of artist magazines that I get <br/>\nwhich have how to articles. She enjoys looking at the sometimes, but she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take them as being a comment on her own work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that rather than bringing a drawing book home unasked, point out <br/>\nbooks about pokemon artistry and the art of anime characters next time you <br/>\nare at the store, or pick up some magazines about Pokemon and anime that are <br/>\nnot necessarily kids mags (ie not Nickelodeon magazine) and aren&#39;t how to <br/>\ndraw publications, but still support his interest and will foster his <br/>\nability to visualize the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso just keep supplying high quality tools and real art supplies. The <br/>\ndrawing tools make a big difference to Jayn&#39;s various styles - fine line <br/>\nmarkers and mechanical pencils produce a much different result than starting <br/>\nwith crayons or colored pencils. She likes having the variety and choices of <br/>\nall her materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

He was showing me some of his fabulous creations <br/>\ntoday,  complete with names and &quot;skills&quot; (he didn&#39;t use to include their skills <br/>\non  paper, but would tell us-at this point, he is making them &quot;roadsign&quot;  <br/>\nmini-pictures and explaining what the mini-pictures mean). His drawings are  still <br/>\nmostly stick-figure, but bodies kind of fleshed out from the stick part,  <br/>\nIYKWIM, and I was wondering if I should bring a book about &quot;how to draw&quot; into  the <br/>\nhouse. If it were me at that age (heck, likely if it were me at *this* age),  <br/>\nI would likely take a book like that to mean that my drawing was being judged <br/>\n and found lacking, so I don&#39;t want to induce this in my child(ren), but <br/>\nwho&#39;s to  say their thoughts would even venture that way?
