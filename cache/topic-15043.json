He<br/>\ndoes sound like he needs some sort of help. It would freak me out if some<br/>\nguy I didn&#39;t know wanted to fiddle with my hair! It sounds as if you have a<br/>\ntricky situation on your hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only other suggestions - does he have relatives anywhere you could<br/>\ncontact? Or maybe emailing Tony Attwood - I believe he&#39;s in Australia but<br/>\nmay have some suggestions. Believe me I&#39;m no expert - we have had one Dr say<br/>\n&quot;Asperger Syndrome&quot; and a psychologist say &quot;Doesn&#39;t fit the criteria closely<br/>\nenough for it to be Asperger Syndrome&quot; so the jury is still out so to speak.<br/>\nIt&#39;s from the reading I have done that I get many &#39;Aha&#39;s!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I can&#39;t be more help. There are so many disorders out there that are<br/>\nso similar it can be hard to know sometimes - and they&#39;re only a label. From<br/>\nmy reading most Aspies are just a bit odd or eccentric by their mid to late<br/>\n20&#39;s or early 30&#39;s. A lot of them function really well - maybe your<br/>\nnieghbours is also a low intelligence thing as well. How does he do in his<br/>\njob? Is he like this with his co workers?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Alison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15040,"nextTopicId":15049}}
