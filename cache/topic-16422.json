I am shaking I am <br/>\n&gt; so angy.  I am just wanting to vent and maybe have some input as to <br/>\n&gt; what I can say to her or any of my family members,, I know this is <br/>\n&gt; just the beginning....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me give you a brief background... I come from a family of 5 kids <br/>\n&gt; (happened in 7 years) I am the Third child... with two older siblings <br/>\n&gt; and two younger siblings... My two older sibling (sisters) have <br/>\n&gt; daughters within a year or so of my own daughter age 6.  They are the <br/>\n&gt; ones that are very into &quot;school&quot;  My two younger sibs don&#39;t have kids <br/>\n&gt; but only add to the opposing opinion....  My Dad doesn&#39;t say anything <br/>\n&gt; and my mom acts as though I have joined a cult that shaves heads and <br/>\n&gt; tortures Lord only knows....  Thankfully we live away from each other <br/>\n&gt; and we rarely talk about education.  A few times when the subject has <br/>\n&gt; come up, my mother FIRMLY mentions her feelings on homeschooling...  <br/>\n&gt; very much opposing.  She is freakishly passive aggresive about it... <br/>\n&gt; after the conversations I am always thinking... heyya wait... (It <br/>\n&gt; never seems worth going back to clarify)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel I am a fairly assertive person.  Since my husband I have been <br/>\n&gt; married (11 years) we have always done things differently than the <br/>\n&gt; rest of our families (sometimes it feels like the world!) .  When it <br/>\n&gt; came to parenting...  ..attachment parenting...  child led...whatever <br/>\n&gt; it was.. we were different from them....  It is just what *we* chose <br/>\n&gt; that worked for us... Overall...  We just like to hang out with our <br/>\n&gt; kids.. discover life... play.. learn together as a family and lead a <br/>\n&gt; *PEACEFUL* life....  From the very beginning we have always gotten the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;you shoulds&quot;... the &quot;you better&quot; and on and on... we decided after <br/>\n&gt; struggling a few years that we gave up caring about people &quot;shoulding <br/>\n&gt; all over us&quot;.... <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So the first crop of babies are in the area of &quot;school age&quot;........  <br/>\n&gt; Arriving at another difference in perspective, parenting and <br/>\n&gt; ideals.....  Why don&#39;t they just leave us alone?!?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just said to my husband last night... you know ... it is just a <br/>\n&gt; matter of time before we are going to get blasted with &quot;questions&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Because it is the fall ... my daughter would be in the first grade...  <br/>\n&gt; They really are wanting to &quot;talk&quot; about everything... I believe  it is <br/>\n&gt; so they can give us the&quot;answers&quot; and &quot;save our children&quot; after <br/>\n&gt; discussing their concerns.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today must have been my lucky day... I just got blasted....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I called my sister kim who lives 45 minutes away....  I was telling <br/>\n&gt; her about a warehouse that was selling these software programs for $1 <br/>\n&gt; - $4 bucks!  She went into this thing about how her daughter (now 2nd <br/>\n&gt; grade) has sooo much homework every night that she just can;t see <br/>\n&gt; having her do anything else academic....  I said... &quot;wow.. I don;t <br/>\n&gt; blame you!!... wow!  homework?&quot;... My sister then went on to say how <br/>\n&gt; awful it has been.. that she comes home and has to do these sheets on <br/>\n&gt; every subject.. &quot;  I interjected..(thinking I was being sympathetic) <br/>\n&gt; ..&quot;That is too bad... what an infringement on family time!&quot;... the <br/>\n&gt; light conversation turned,,,,,  My sister started talking rapidly.,... <br/>\n&gt; (The oh my gosh... I am saying something bad about my prized <br/>\n&gt; educational system.. hit her)  She went on to say  WELL... I was <br/>\n&gt; talking to SO MANY of my friends .... they feel it is SO IMPORTANT <br/>\n&gt; that they start NOW so that when they are in the 5th grade they are <br/>\n&gt; trained to do &quot;important&quot; homework.... She took a<br/>\n&gt; breath.. seeing that I was about to board a train that was going to <br/>\n&gt; end in derailment... ... I said.. &quot;oh man... you know what Kim, we <br/>\n&gt; just can&#39;t talk about this... I feel so very differently...  &quot;    <br/>\n&gt; Defensively she said &quot;Now wait a minute... All my friends think that <br/>\n&gt; was SUCH A BLESSING to have that because what are they going to <br/>\n&gt; do?.... Get dumped with homework in the 5th grade??&quot;... I repeated.. <br/>\n&gt; Kim.. We just have to agree not to talk about this.... I just can&#39;t go <br/>\n&gt; there.... Kim couldnt get passed that she was trying to &quot;explain&quot; to <br/>\n&gt; me that it is SO IMPORTANT to have these daily sheets completed to get <br/>\n&gt; prepared....  and really that I should listen to her because &quot;when my <br/>\n&gt; daughter gets into the 5th grade she is going tohave to do it <br/>\n&gt; too&quot;...... ...  what?  wait... She just wasn;t getting it... Is there <br/>\n&gt; some kind of law out there that every child in the &quot;fifth grade&quot; has <br/>\n&gt; to have homework?....  I kept thinking.. she knows we homeschool.... <br/>\n&gt; does she think that a teacher comes to our<br/>\n&gt; house and assigns us this????   I calmly said... (probably in a very <br/>\n&gt; shakey voice though) Kim... we need to talk about something else.... <br/>\n&gt; Kim replied very snotty and in her big sister (15 month older) <br/>\n&gt; voice... &quot;What... we can;t talk about my views on education?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (silent scream)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I continued... Kim.. It isn&#39;t about that... I just see things <br/>\n&gt; differently....  She just couldn;t get it... She asked... What do YOU <br/>\n&gt; do?  Getting stupidly caught in a what I thought as an easy answer I <br/>\n&gt; responded... well... we unschool.  We feel it is important for kids to <br/>\n&gt; run jump play, explore, discover and enjoy....  She urgently asked,,, <br/>\n&gt; WELL.. what DO you DO on a typical day?  She went on and said...  <br/>\n&gt; asked?....  I mean your daughter Obviously knows how to read...    I <br/>\n&gt; took a deep breath and said...  That is just it Kim... WHY is it so <br/>\n&gt; obvious that she should know how to read?  Our society deems <br/>\n&gt; intelligence based on reading and writing,,, we don&#39;t... whether she <br/>\n&gt; can read or not or any child for that matter.... I tried using the <br/>\n&gt; analogy of a child learning to walk... they get their on their own <br/>\n&gt; time....    I then said (knowing that I had already said too much in a <br/>\n&gt; no win situation) We don&#39;t learn A to Z we learn the letters as we <br/>\n&gt; live.. in the end we have a complete set.... She<br/>\n&gt; jumped in...  We did too.. we taught H first and then.. and then,,,,  <br/>\n&gt; She just couldn&#39;t get it.. Then she asked,. &quot;Well what do you do on a <br/>\n&gt; typical day??&quot;  I said every day is different..  She said.. Do you do <br/>\n&gt; math with her (asking in a total flabergasted tone)  I said, yes. we <br/>\n&gt; cook.....         &quot;You cook.&quot; she replied in a very bewildered <br/>\n&gt; condescending way.... I said... yeah, you should see how she has <br/>\n&gt; picked up on her fractions...  My two year old started crying in the <br/>\n&gt; background....  She asked... when do you teach her things...?  I <br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t responding because I was talking to my little guy... I could <br/>\n&gt; hear her chattering about something...  My son started crying more...  <br/>\n&gt; I picked him up... She then asked... in a very.. sweet calm way as if <br/>\n&gt; the title to me was going to be.... &quot;Honey,&quot;... then she <br/>\n&gt; asked..(firing them out)..  Do you ever get a break from your kids? <br/>\n&gt; Are you and your daughter ever apart from each other?  Do they get the <br/>\n&gt; opportunity to learn from other people other than<br/>\n&gt; you?....  I simply said.. when she wants art we go to an artist,, when <br/>\n&gt; we need science she goes to a scientist at a college... history in a <br/>\n&gt; museum...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; really getting frustrated because I feel they get so much from <br/>\n&gt; everybody.. including us... but in their way.... I said... Kim... <br/>\n&gt; gotta go... before I could say anything else.. SHE said,, GOOD        <br/>\n&gt; BYE and hung up on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ahhhhhhhhhhhh   Do I come from a freakishly narrow minded family?  Has <br/>\n&gt; anyone ever encountered this?  I get the lovely opportunity to be with <br/>\n&gt; the older-sibling-hens that will have a field day over just this <br/>\n&gt; conversation.... I know I need to just let it go.. but yowsee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another really concerning area... Kims daughter that is in the second <br/>\n&gt; grade - just 4 months older than my daughter whom we say is in the 1st <br/>\n&gt; grade...  is CONSTANTLY grilling my daughter about everything.... She <br/>\n&gt; obviously gets things from her mother...  Her cousin asks... are you <br/>\n&gt; really homeschooled?  What is 2 plus 2?  She will brag about a field <br/>\n&gt; trip they went on or what they do at recess.....

I am shaking I am so angy.  I am just wanting to vent and maybe have some input as to what I can say to her or any of my family members,, I know this is just the beginning....<br/>\n <br/>\nLet me give you a brief background... I come from a family of 5 kids (happened in 7 years) I am the Third child... with two older siblings and two younger siblings... My two older sibling (sisters) have daughters within a year or so of my own daughter age 6.  They are the ones that are very into &quot;school&quot;  My two younger sibs don&#39;t have kids but only add to the opposing opinion....  My Dad doesn&#39;t say anything and my mom acts as though I have joined a cult that shaves heads and tortures Lord only knows....  Thankfully we live away from each other and we rarely talk about education.  A few times when the subject has come up, my mother FIRMLY mentions her feelings on homeschooling...  very much opposing.  She is freakishly passive aggresive about it... after the conversations I am always thinking... heyya wait... (It never seems worth going back to clarify)<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel I am a fairly assertive person.  Since my husband I have been married (11 years) we have always done things differently than the rest of our families (sometimes it feels like the world!) .  When it came to parenting...  ..attachment parenting...  child led...whatever it was.. we were different from them....  It is just what *we* chose that worked for us... Overall...  We just like to hang out with our kids.. discover life... play.. learn together as a family and lead a *PEACEFUL* life....  From the very beginning we have always gotten the &quot;you shoulds&quot;... the &quot;you better&quot; and on and on... we decided after struggling a few years that we gave up caring about people &quot;shoulding all over us&quot;....  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo the first crop of babies are in the area of &quot;school age&quot;........  Arriving at another difference in perspective, parenting and ideals.....  Why don&#39;t they just leave us alone?!?!<br/>\n <br/>\nI just said to my husband last night... you know ... it is just a matter of time before we are going to get blasted with &quot;questions&quot;  Because it is the fall ... my daughter would be in the first grade...  They really are wanting to &quot;talk&quot; about everything... I believe  it is so they can give us the&quot;answers&quot; and &quot;save our children&quot; after discussing their concerns.....<br/>\n <br/>\nToday must have been my lucky day... I just got blasted....<br/>\n <br/>\nI called my sister kim who lives 45 minutes away....  I was telling her about a warehouse that was selling these software programs for $1 - $4 bucks!  She went into this thing about how her daughter (now 2nd grade) has sooo much homework every night that she just can;t see having her do anything else academic....  I said... &quot;wow.. I don;t blame you!!... wow!  homework?&quot;... My sister then went on to say how awful it has been.. that she comes home and has to do these sheets on every subject.. &quot;  I interjected..(thinking I was being sympathetic) ..&quot;That is too bad... what an infringement on family time!&quot;... the light conversation turned,,,,,  My sister started talking rapidly.,... (The oh my gosh... I am saying something bad about my prized educational system.. hit her)  She went on to say  WELL... I was talking to SO MANY of my friends .... they feel it is SO IMPORTANT that they start NOW so that when they are in the 5th grade they are trained to do &quot;important&quot; homework.... She took a<br/>\n breath.. seeing that I was about to board a train that was going to end in derailment... ... I said.. &quot;oh man... you know what Kim, we just can&#39;t talk about this... I feel so very differently...  &quot;    Defensively she said &quot;Now wait a minute... All my friends think that was SUCH A BLESSING to have that because what are they going to do?.... Get dumped with homework in the 5th grade??&quot;... I repeated.. Kim.. We just have to agree not to talk about this.... I just can&#39;t go there.... Kim couldnt get passed that she was trying to &quot;explain&quot; to me that it is SO IMPORTANT to have these daily sheets completed to get prepared....  and really that I should listen to her because &quot;when my daughter gets into the 5th grade she is going tohave to do it too&quot;...... ...  what?  wait... She just wasn;t getting it... Is there some kind of law out there that every child in the &quot;fifth grade&quot; has to have homework?....  I kept thinking.. she knows we homeschool.... does she think that a teacher comes to our<br/>\n house and assigns us this????   I calmly said... (probably in a very shakey voice though) Kim... we need to talk about something else.... Kim replied very snotty and in her big sister (15 month older) voice... &quot;What... we can;t talk about my views on education?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n(silent scream)<br/>\n <br/>\nI continued... Kim.. It isn&#39;t about that... I just see things differently....  She just couldn;t get it... She asked... What do YOU do?  Getting stupidly caught in a what I thought as an easy answer I responded... well... we unschool.  We feel it is important for kids to run jump play, explore, discover and enjoy....  She urgently asked,,, WELL.. what DO you DO on a typical day?  She went on and said...  asked?....  I mean your daughter Obviously knows how to read...    I took a deep breath and said...  That is just it Kim... WHY is it so obvious that she should know how to read?  Our society deems intelligence based on reading and writing,,, we don&#39;t... whether she can read or not or any child for that matter.... I tried using the analogy of a child learning to walk... they get their on their own time....    I then said (knowing that I had already said too much in a no win situation) We don&#39;t learn A to Z we learn the letters as we live.. in the end we have a complete set.... She<br/>\n jumped in...  We did too.. we taught H first and then.. and then,,,,  She just couldn&#39;t get it.. Then she asked,. &quot;Well what do you do on a typical day??&quot;  I said every day is different..  She said.. Do you do math with her (asking in a total flabergasted tone)  I said, yes. we cook.....         &quot;You cook.&quot; she replied in a very bewildered condescending way.... I said... yeah, you should see how she has picked up on her fractions...  My two year old started crying in the background....  She asked... when do you teach her things...?  I wasn&#39;t responding because I was talking to my little guy... I could hear her chattering about something...  My son started crying more...  I picked him up... She then asked... in a very.. sweet calm way as if the title to me was going to be.... &quot;Honey,&quot;... then she asked..(firing them out)..  Do you ever get a break from your kids? Are you and your daughter ever apart from each other?  Do they get the opportunity to learn from other people other than<br/>\n you?....  I simply said.. when she wants art we go to an artist,, when we need science she goes to a scientist at a college... history in a museum... <br/>\n <br/>\nreally getting frustrated because I feel they get so much from everybody.. including us... but in their way.... I said... Kim... gotta go... before I could say anything else.. SHE said,, GOOD        BYE and hung up on me.<br/>\n <br/>\nahhhhhhhhhhhh   Do I come from a freakishly narrow minded family?  Has anyone ever encountered this?  I get the lovely opportunity to be with the older-sibling-hens that will have a field day over just this conversation.... I know I need to just let it go.. but yowsee.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother really concerning area... Kims daughter that is in the second grade - just 4 months older than my daughter whom we say is in the 1st grade...  is CONSTANTLY grilling my daughter about everything.... She obviously gets things from her mother...  Her cousin asks... are you really homeschooled?  What is 2 plus 2?  She will brag about a field trip they went on or what they do at recess.....  I have HEARD it...  In the past I have said.. wow... sounds like fun...  we do crazy things like that too....  (What I really want to do is slam dunk her... I hate that in me!)  What in the heck do I say to my daughter???  I don;t want her to be nasty, but I don;t want her to feel walked on either???!!<br/>\n <br/>\nHELP~!<br/>\n <br/>\nCynthia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

Kids are force-taught to sound out words and read boring stuff like &quot;jack & jill and their dog bill&quot;  (really a title my neighbor&#39;s 2nd grader is reading).  I mean, who wants to read that?  My brother and I used to think it great fun to just choose a World Book letter at random and read about all sorts of stuff.  My sister really took off when she read her first Heinlein book.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest was forced to read at 6 in school, but really didn&#39;t do it for pleasure until he was 12 or so, starting with the Goosebumps stories, then he discovered Lord of the Flies, which he&#39;s read so many times his copy is tattered.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor your neice, it may or may not be happening now -- maybe she&#39;s just curious about letters, or sounds and really enjoys being read to, but isn&#39;t ready to read herself.  What I&#39;m saying, is don&#39;t attach too much expectation to it.  I found with my oldest that he resisted learning to read himself -- or to letting others know he could read -- because he worried that once we know he could read, we&#39;d stop reading to him, leaving him alone with books when he really craved the one-on-one time of being read to.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

I had never made any point of<br/>\nteaching the kids to read--at the time I thought that was school&#39;s job<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;.  I simply read to them.  The Hobbit, The Wind in the Willows,<br/>\nanything that would hold my attention and theirs.  Dad was the one<br/>\nwilling to read the little golden books over and over every night--maybe<br/>\nbecause they were short :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then went on to assist his older brother (just turned 5 at the time)<br/>\nto learn to read--Jon (younger) would sit by Chris and read to him,<br/>\nanswer his questions.

I don&#39;t remember a<br/>\nparticular moment in which he was suddenly reading, but it came to pass<br/>\nover that summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little more active in my daughter&#39;s learning to read--which<br/>\nmeans I continued reading to her, but also played more word games (a<br/>\nfavorite, still, is to come up with all the words we can think of which<br/>\nrhyme), made written lists of really simple words that rhyme when she<br/>\nseemed to be interested, and got a workbook (Dr Seuss again, and<br/>\nsuperbly designed) as much because we were moving and facing long car<br/>\ntrips (2 cars, so I had to drive the whole trip).

She went through<br/>\nsome really obsessive periods with writing. I think she learned most of her<br/>\nletters around 2.5/3 and would write them on long strips of paper.

For her, it wasn&#39;t important that her writing made no sense<br/>\nto adults. When she asked me to read it, I sounded her writing out as best I<br/>\ncould. When she wanted to know what it meant -- I would be honest and tell<br/>\nher I didn&#39;t know. I remember telling her that maybe her word/words meant<br/>\nsomething in another language -- she liked that! Oh - the other really cute<br/>\nthing I remember is that she would sit at her computer - which is directly<br/>\nbehind mine - and would type &quot;emails&quot; to me on her word processing program.<br/>\nAgain, strings of letters -- I couldn&#39;t make heads or tails out of it -- but<br/>\nshe understood it and was very proud of herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe learned to read really simple stuff between 3-4 and her writing started<br/>\nto indicate the words she could read - like cat, dog, mom, dad, and some of<br/>\nher friends names. She also got into copying words from kid dictionaries at<br/>\nthat age. Now she&#39;s into writing &quot;chinese&quot; with a feather and ink -- looks<br/>\nvery cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nHurray for letting kids do what they please...be it writing, legos, knex,<br/>\nslopping in the mud, barbies....whatever! &quot;One thing leads to another&quot;.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Our three year old daughter loves to write. She makes lists and crosses<br/>\nthings off. Asks us to spell things and writes t410hem down. Write us<br/>\nletters. Interviews us and writes down the answer. All of it perfectly<br/>\nindecipherable to us. She writes individual letters and does so from left to<br/>\nright and from top to bottom just like normal writing.

Has it always been this way, or did you have rough <br/>\npatches?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is only 10, but he&#39;s very independent and strong willed.  <br/>\nGood traits, yes, but I tend to be a worrier and have a hard time <br/>\nfinding the balance between accepting his desire to be on his own <br/>\nand make his own decisions (like ride his bike everywhere, including <br/>\nhigh traffic areas, without a helmet for example) and my very strong <br/>\nneed to protect him.  It sometimes feels like protecting our <br/>\nrelationship is in direct conflict with protecting *him*. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example... there was a party at the beach near us the other <br/>\nday that went on past dark... a very big party with bonfires etc.  <br/>\nThe ocean was quite rough due to the aftermath of the hurricane, and <br/>\nhe was swimming and riding the waves while I was there during the <br/>\nday to pay close attention in case he needed help.  I needed to <br/>\nleave after dark because my 4yo was tired and cranky and 10yo wanted <br/>\nto stay with friends.  That was fine with me, but one stipulation <br/>\nwas that I didn&#39;t want him to go back in the water again... the <br/>\ncombination of rough surf, no lifeguards, after dark, and the fact <br/>\nthat the only other adults he&#39;d be in the presence of had been <br/>\ndrinking and were socializing and not paying attention was too much <br/>\nfor me.  This resulted in a very tense argument between the two of <br/>\nus, and I&#39;m alarmed that these clashes are happening more frequently <br/>\nas he gets older.  The *most* alarming thing to me is his seeming <br/>\nbelief in his own invincibility.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s a mother to do in these situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI can certainly relate to the terror of having an &quot;invincible&quot; child.  I wasn&#39;t always so trusting.  A couple years ago, I couldn&#39;t tolerate the suffering in my relationship with the kids and found a teacher to help me move from a stance of fear to love.  I used to think that I loved the kids, and what I actually was was afraid that something terrible would happen to them and I wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it.  I was living in survival/adrenalin mode - exactly the opposite of the environment I wanted to create for my kids or myself. Now I know the difference between love and fear.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI still get afraid sometimes.  I stop and just feel it before doing anything about it.  I tell them directly &quot;I&#39;m afraid&quot; and why.  That is so honest and open that they listen and respond.  Whereas, if I just try to make them do what I want I become a force which, by natural law, creates it&#39;s own counterforce.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy paying attention to my gut feelings, not my mind racing, I model for them how to pay attention to their real feelings that do sense danger, rather than all the thinking about what might go wrong.  It&#39;s important to feel safe in the world and use that quiet inner guidance system.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just became certified to teach the parenting class, The Gift of Being Welcomed.  I&#39;m hoping to start teaching a class in a few weeks.  We do have a yahoo group where we discuss the welcoming response.
