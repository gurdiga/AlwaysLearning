Usually it&#39;s just a matter of reminding or<br/>\ninforming them the group is inclusive and they either stay or go away once<br/>\nthey have that information, but there are a few atheists and agnostics in<br/>\nour group who get *really* upset about the assumptions. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve had<br/>\nenough bad experiences that it&#39;s pardonable, but it does make them look<br/>\nover-reactive (to most, including the other atheists and the Christian-Lites<br/>\nlike me &lt;g&gt;) in context.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Re: Stepping in the hornet&#39;s nest and<br/>\nintro<br/>\nDate: Mon, Dec 17, 2001, 1:38 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe you could tell your atheist members you&#39;ll keep praying that<br/>\nthey&#39;ll learn some manners. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe.
