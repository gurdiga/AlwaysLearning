It can be breath-taking and heartbreaking all rolled into those <br/>\nconversations, but I think I am most grateful that they truly listen to all the music <br/>\nwe enjoy and want to understand the perplexities of society because of some <br/>\ngreat lyrics. Just Friday, while at another homeschooler&#39;s birthday party, we <br/>\n(adults) discussed music and it&#39;s effects on our society. We, DH & I, do not <br/>\ncensor the music the girls listen to, but rather try to learn what it is the <br/>\nsinger/songwriters are trying to say with them. I knew I would get a few eyeballs <br/>\npopping out when I said that during the party. Not everyone understands why we <br/>\ndon&#39;t censor their music as most parents I know do censor their kids music. <br/>\nOf course I have difficulty from the unschooler&#39;s perspective, especially when <br/>\nmusic is not &quot;allowed&quot; for some kids due to the lyrics, but I accept that not <br/>\neveryone is willing to subject themselves to hear things they are convinced as <br/>\njust negativity to sell records. It just isn&#39;t that way for us, we see that <br/>\nmost songs are a story and generally have something to be gained, even those <br/>\ndrenched in profanity. Kass & Kree don&#39;t understand such censorship yet, maybe <br/>\nthey never will, since they haven&#39;t been subjected to that and may never be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who by the way Dar, after I posted those lyrics and hit send I <br/>\nthought, wow, what if SHE is the same Dar???
