Listening is not reading...<br/>\n<br/>\nObjects of worship need to have paper, the fewer **pictures** the<br/>\nmore holy, the nicer the cover the more reverence.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I sent it out with &quot;the fewer words&quot; but that&#39;s not what I meant.<br/>\nI&#39;m kind of out of it the past couple of days; sorry.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this was so interesting, because my thoughts immediately went <br/>\nto the Judaism I grew up with, and how book-worship might figure into <br/>\nthat tradition... being the &#39;people of the book&#39; and all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, first, given that there wasn&#39;t technology/media, and writing/paper <br/>\nwere the only choice aside from oral tradition, Judaism doesn&#39;t fit into <br/>\nthat category of what objects of worship need to have, at least in my <br/>\nmind.  The Torah, when looked at from outside of the tradition looks <br/>\nlike the book Sandra described - a modern printed book, with gold leafed <br/>\nedges, and a ribbon to mark your place. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut... traditional Jews don&#39;t see that as the book of worship.  That is <br/>\njust a &#39;copy.&#39;  The real thing is read from, listened to, read out loud <br/>\nby a live person, every week.  And its not a &#39;book.&#39;   Its a scroll, <br/>\nprinted on animal hide of some sort, written by hand by a special <br/>\nscribe.  The book itself as tons of words, and the letters themselves <br/>\nare derived from &#39;pictures&#39; of a sort (Aleph, the first letter of the <br/>\nalephbet, represents of Ram, Bet, the second letter, is a picture of a <br/>\nhouse, etc).  And then the Rabbis throughout history took each of those <br/>\nwords and added more words of interpretation (which gives me problems in <br/>\nother ways... but its intriguing and mind-boggling the sheer quantity of <br/>\ninterpretation that Judaism encouraged, and also the inter-connectdness <br/>\nof the interpretations, and also the fact that people who lived together <br/>\nand believed the same things often came up with completely opposing <br/>\nunderstandings of the texts). <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and its interesting that the written Torah is considered only equal <br/>\nin holiness/value, not more, to the Oral Tradition, which is less widely <br/>\nknown about among non-Jews and non-traditional Jews. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, also interesting.  The way the Torah is learned is not through <br/>\nreading, or listening, its through discussion.  The traditional method <br/>\nof Jewish &quot;education&quot; is actually called &#39;learning&#39; not teaching or <br/>\neducation.  And the form is for two people who are partnered up to <br/>\nlearn/translate/read a particular part of the text, and then sit and <br/>\nargue about its meaning.  Argument is the principle method of <br/>\nunderstanding meaning.  Isn&#39;t that interesting?  I&#39;m fascinated <br/>\nsometimes with that, because its a completely different understanding of <br/>\nhow learning occurs from mainstream education... and it seems extra <br/>\nstrange to me that religious Jewish schools still use that form of <br/>\nlearning for those subjects, but have completely taken up the mainstream <br/>\nunderstanding of education for the modern subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ve gone off topic for a moment.  But I thought the book thing <br/>\nwas interesting. Are other religions this way? <br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54131,"nextTopicId":54105}}
