I want to share in his excitement, it&#39;s just really hard to embrace something I find so lame.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pokemon marked the beginning of my being able to truly embrace my son&#39;s interests.  I remember the moment clearly.  We were in a bookstore, and Ethan picked up a Pokemon guide book.  He fell in love with the characters.  My mind went to, &quot;Oh no, not Pokemon!&quot;  I&#39;m embarrassed to say that I would have said something like, &quot;Oh, we don&#39;t need Pokemon&quot; in the past, and I would have directed him to something *I* thought was more valuable.  Thankfully, I didn&#39;t do that this time, and that decision led us into the Pokemon World in full.  I&#39;m so happy it did, because I learned so much about Ethan, and so much about learning, by really getting into his excitement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched all of the shows.  Like you, I cringed at first.  They were loud and repetitive and simple to my ears.  To Ethan&#39;s ears, though, I could see they were exciting, empowering and every show had something for him to think about, and act out later.  We did a lot of acting out in the yard.  Ethan was always Raichu.  I liked the little quiet Pokemon (I forget the name now).  He protected me.  He loved that!  He loved that part of Pokemon - that these cute characters were so brave and strong.  He loved their special abilities.  He loved learning them, and then imagining what it would be like to have his favourites.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played the card game, which I ended up really liking.  For Halloween, we made a Raichu costume.  So many people (kids and young adults) in our town knew who he was.  He felt so proud of that.  I think he felt like the hero, Raichu, himself.  We took out books from the library and searched for cards on Ebay.  I like drawing, so I picked up a how-to book on Pokemon characters.  I made window stickers and drawings that we hung up on the walls.  I made a couple of simple hand puppets for him and his friend to use.  Surprisingly, Ethan was not interested in the video game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI soon found myself exclaiming how much I loved Pokemon to adult friends (who mostly groaned).  Then, gradually, the interest waned.  I felt kind of sad, to be honest.  We explored some other Manga, but so far, there hasn&#39;t been the same appeal.  Although, he did really like The Avatar series.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDid I really love Pokemon?  I did, but not because I thought it was brilliant, although there are some really brilliant aspects.  I loved it because I shared it with my son.  I got lost in the play with him.  I really got to know him.  And, in sharing this experience with him, I was finally able to see the learning that happens outside of the restraints of schoolish thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPokemon does have a lot of math, reading, art etc.  But, more importantly, it is the experience of fully and joyfully embracing that which captivates one&#39;s imagination that brings learning to life.  Learning, then, becomes bigger than subjects.  It becomes a living curiosity that doesn&#39;t stop at math, reading and art, but moves fluidly through all experiences, making connections everywhere - building the structure on which the person will inevitably stand solidly.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Are we stuck?

Robyn Coburn wrote once, and I wish I could find it, about watching television that she wouldn&#39;t have chosen, but that Jayn had, for plot devices or for costuming or for something else. You could watch the show for scenes being recycled. You could look for how the characters are the same or how they are different. You could dissect the show as you watch it instead of being annoyed by it. Find your own joy in Pokemon. You could think about the biology and what kind of animals or plants the pokemon are drawn from. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I love Pokemon. I have a great affection for Team Rocket and Meowth (that&#39;s right). When Simon was 3 and 4 and we lived in Japan we would get a Pokemon figure every time we went into downtown Kyoto, or anywhere, really, that had the figures. But it was an exchange for his coming along with us. Linnaea was tiny, so she didn&#39;t need any inducement. I&#39;ve set up those figures in little tableaus in so many different places. And they were fabulous in the B&#39;damen battles. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We drew Pokemon. We made Pokemon out of coloured glue on acetate paper and then put them in the windows. Simon learned about inches and feet and centimetres and metres from having me show him how big Pokemon would be from the information in the Pokemon book we got from a garage sale. We talked about where they get all that size from when they change from one form to another. I read a lot about SatoshiTajiri (I think Sandra may have some of that on her website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/game/pokemon)\">http://sandradodd.com/game/pokemon)</a> and why Pokemon are as they are. When Simon was 4 my brother gave him a gameboy and I bought Pokemon gold for him. He would cuddle on my lap and I would play the game, reading all the text as we went through it. It was so wonderfully sweet to be with my boy, sharing the excitement and puzzle solving together. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I miss Pokemon. I miss that kind of play and discussion and Jessie and James and Misty and Ash and Brock. Brock&#39;s fabulous. I know the characters now are much different than they were, and I don&#39;t know much about them. It helps me to focus on them and their interests now to know that it is all temporary. I live time in a linear way. I get each day, each moment as a series. And once those moments have passed, the next one fills up the space. I don&#39;t get to go back and have that Pokemon time again. And my memory is phenomenally imperfect. That knowledge has helped me, on more than one occasion, to be sweeter, kinder, more engaged, more patient, than I might otherwise have been. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Schuyler<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________<br/>\n&gt; From: Kim Zerbe &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim.zerbe@...\">kim.zerbe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, 22 November 2011, 9:17<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Are we stuck?

Are you suffering from a touch of SADs that&#39;s making you feel like watching Pokemon over and over again is torture? Can you do something to help you feel better? fuller? more capable of engagement? Can you realign your vision, your thinking, to see Pokemon from a different angle? Robyn Coburn wrote once, and I wish I could find it, about watching television that she wouldn&#39;t have chosen, but that Jayn had, for plot devices or for costuming or for something else. You could watch the show for scenes being recycled. You could look for how the characters are the same or how they are different. You could dissect the show as you watch it instead of being annoyed by it. Find your own joy in Pokemon. You could think about the biology and what kind of animals or plants the pokemon are drawn from. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love Pokemon. I have a great affection for Team Rocket and Meowth (that&#39;s right). When Simon was 3 and 4 and we lived in Japan we would get a Pokemon figure every time we went into downtown Kyoto, or anywhere, really, that had the figures. But it was an exchange for his coming along with us. Linnaea was tiny, so she didn&#39;t need any inducement. I&#39;ve set up those figures in little tableaus in so many different places. And they were fabulous in the B&#39;damen battles. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe drew Pokemon. We made Pokemon out of coloured glue on acetate paper and then put them in the windows. Simon learned about inches and feet and centimetres and metres from having me show him how big Pokemon would be from the information in the Pokemon book we got from a garage sale. We talked about where they get all that size from when they change from one form to another.
