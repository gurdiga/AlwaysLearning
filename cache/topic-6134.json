Last night <br/>\nshe said <br/>\n&gt; she was really sad because her friend Sarah Louise, who is younger <br/>\nthan she <br/>\n&gt; is, has been reading chapter books for a long time, and Holly can&#39;t. <br/>\n  I said <br/>\n&gt; maybe you can, and she tried some of a Boxcar Children book, just <br/>\nreading to <br/>\n&gt; herself.  She got frustrated.  She asked how kids can learn to read <br/>\nfaster.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I told her there was a book called something like Teaching your <br/>\nChild to <br/>\n&gt; Read in 100 Easy Lessons, and we could look for one.  She said okay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So today we went to the homeschool-specializing used bookstore here <br/>\n(Title <br/>\n&gt; Wave).<br/>\n&gt;  As we were pulling in, I said &quot;I really thought about saying no <br/>\nabout this <br/>\n&gt; book, because I would like for you to know you can learn on your <br/>\nown.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She said, &quot;I know I can learn on my own, but I&#39;m getting tired of <br/>\nwaiting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I asked for the book.  They&#39;d just gotten one in, and although <br/>\nthe first <br/>\n&gt; 2/3 is too easy for her, the back part wasn&#39;t.  I had store credit, <br/>\nso that <br/>\n&gt; was free, more or less &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the owner recommended a local reading book that&#39;s better, she <br/>\nsays, and <br/>\n&gt; Holly liked the look of it, so we got that for $20.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my virginity is gone now, I bought a piece of educational <br/>\ncurriculum!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We also picked up the new, free homeschooling newsletter (a <br/>\nglorified <br/>\n&gt; activities schedule) which had articles by four moms Holly knew <br/>\n(counting <br/>\n&gt; me), and so she knew the kids they were talking about too.  And <br/>\nthere were <br/>\n&gt; quotes by homeschooling kids in town, and Holly was one of them.   <br/>\nSo that <br/>\n&gt; was cool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We got home, and went through two pages of one of the books, and six <br/>\nwords <br/>\n&gt; into the third page, Holly said I don&#39;t want to do this book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Me, in a moment of lack-of-philosophy, said &quot;We just got $30 worth <br/>\nof books <br/>\n&gt; because you wanted to, so you&#39;re going to do them!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m so cool...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So she started to get tears in her eyes, and I accused her of acting <br/>\njust so <br/>\n&gt; I would leave her alone.  (Also we had planned to work on it until I <br/>\nhad to <br/>\n&gt; take Kirby to work, and we had five more minutes.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But she said it was hard and she was making too many mistakes.  So I <br/>\nleft <br/>\n&gt; that page open and told her to look at it later if she wanted to, <br/>\nand we were <br/>\n&gt; both happier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When she can read chapter books and feels successful, I can take <br/>\nboth books <br/>\n&gt; back to the same store and get credit to buy a FUN book with, so <br/>\nit&#39;s not a <br/>\n&gt; total $30 loss.  It will be $15 book credit, and $15 invested in <br/>\neither <br/>\n&gt; helping her or convincing her schoolish help can be something to cry <br/>\nabout.  <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know which yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] mouths of babes","postDate":"1018655485","msgId":6139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWMxZTI3YyRmNTExZWZhMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2MC5jMGNmMTEyLjI5ZThiM2JhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6137,"nextInTopic":6140,"prevInTime":6138,"nextInTime":6140,"topicId":6134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Back when I was a school-at-homer (DOH! ;-), I used the Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons book.

My son was about 5 and we went through it okay with *some* frustration here and there. We got about 3/4 done with the book and my son didn&#39;t want to do it anymore so I said he could stop. BUT, he was reading pretty well by that time - seems he did learn to read with the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried the same thing with my other son at about the same age (a couple years later) and he just DID NOT get it. After the first few easy lessons, when they started getting into reading paragraphs, he struggled so much. It just wasn&#39;t working like it was supposed to, like it had with my other son. I let him give up that book but made him continue with phonics workbooks. These were such a struggle for him to do, I could see his frustration each time he did the workbooks, even though I was sitting right there beside him. He wasn&#39;t getting it! We even tried the ever-popular Phonics Game (because it&#39;s a fun card game! :-p) and he could only kind-of read the 3 letter words, nothing harder than that, no matter how many times we tried playing and S-O-U-N-D-I-N-G out the letters and sounds in each word.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt about that time I discovered unschooling, was actually specifically drawn to the article at the unschooling.com website concerning late readers. I was hooked from that point on! I knew I had FINALLY found the answer to our homeschooling problems. I found people who had the same problems as I did - kids who didn&#39;t like to sit down and do book learning, late readers, frustrated households. And the best part was that I as I learned more about unschooling, I realized that I didn&#39;t have the problems I thought I did afterall. The problems I thought I had were just my kids learning things at their own pace, the way it really should be. I am so thankful to have found unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince dropping all workbooks, phonics lessons, reading lessons, etc. last Sept., my 9 yo hesitant/late reader recently surprised me when I found him in bed one night reading a Pokemon chapter book. I asked him &quot;Can you read that book now?&quot; and he said &quot;yeah, most of it. Some words are a little hard but I just skip over those&quot;. He had tried reading that book several times already in months past and was still too frustrated with his reading level to stay with it. But this past week, HE GOT IT! He is starting to read BECAUSE I stopped trying to teach him reading. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 12, 2002 3:03 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] mouths of babes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/12/02 12:28:56 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Joylyn<br/>\n  Mom to Lexie (6) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lexie&#39;s the one at the conference!

Janene decided she wanted an<br/>\norange and that it needed to be cut and so<br/>\ndid, cutting her finger in the<br/>\nprocess. I can&#39;t blame her or mark or myself<br/>\nor the fact a knife was<br/>\navailable--just last month I cut my finger<br/>\npretty badly, and I&#39;m a grown up,<br/>\nor at least that&#39;s what people say.   So,<br/>\nmark takes her to urgent care.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe doctor and nurse, as they are examining<br/>\nthe finger, talk to Lexie and<br/>\nJanene and make comments about how smart they<br/>\nare, etc.  Then Lexie breaks<br/>\nthe news--we homeschool.  What does that<br/>\nmean.   You don&#39;t go to school at<br/>\nall, asks the doctor.  Nope, Lexie says.  You<br/>\ndon&#39;t go to school in the<br/>\nafternoons? Take a math class? Nope, says<br/>\nLexie.  Doctor looks at Mark and<br/>\nsays &quot;don&#39;t you want them to be around other<br/>\nchildren?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMark tries to explain that they are around<br/>\nlots of other children, every<br/>\nday.  Lexie, who is still wearing her &quot;thing<br/>\n1&quot; tag from the Dr. Suess day at<br/>\nthe park, and who is wearing obviously<br/>\nmismatched clothing, again in honor of<br/>\nDr. Suess, tells the doctor &quot;I&#39;m around a lot<br/>\nof kids, I go to Girl Scouts,<br/>\nto Soccer, to Park days.&quot;  Mark continues<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not sure why they call it<br/>\nhomeschooling, that&#39;s a misnomer, as we are<br/>\nreally never at home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOK so Janene&#39;s finger is glued with purple<br/>\nglue (dermabond) and they go<br/>\nhome.  Later that night her finger starts to<br/>\nbleed again so back we go.<br/>\nLexie said it was like Dejavu (after I<br/>\nprovide the word), as we parked in the<br/>\nsame spot, had the same doctor, same nurse,<br/>\nand were in the same room.  This<br/>\ntime the doctor just puts a bunch of strips<br/>\non Janene&#39;s finger, taping it up<br/>\nwell.  The doctor continues to asks questions<br/>\nabout homeschooling, now he is<br/>\nconfused because I work all day. How can I<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; my child if I am not<br/>\nthere.  Lexie explained that she just learns<br/>\nthrough life and that daddy<br/>\n&quot;really just provides transportation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\nMom to Lexie (6) and Janene (3)<br/>\nFor great nursing clothes and slings, go to<br/>\nwww.4mommyandme.com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wasn&#39;t it Mark Twain who said it takes a<br/>\nvery dull person to spell a word only one<br/>\nway?&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6166,"nextTopicId":6141}}
