Xander has<br/>\nalways been on a strict sleeping/mealtime schedule, even though the rest of<br/>\nour day is quite relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my mind has been opened to the logic behind radical<br/>\nunschooling/peaceful parenting I am struggling with what to do in some<br/>\nareas. We have mealtimes pretty much sorted out (we still have our regular<br/>\nmealtimes, but we also have all of Xander&#39;s &quot;dry-food&quot; [crackers, dried<br/>\nfruit, etc] available for him to access whenever, and we&#39;ve just created<br/>\nand printed up food charts for the wall to give him the opportunity to tell<br/>\nus if there&#39;s anything he wants from the fridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sleep-times. Gosh. Xander is still so young that it seemed only<br/>\nyesterday I wasn&#39;t getting any sleep at all! I am absolutely terrified that<br/>\nif I change his schedule (or let him dictate his schedule) it&#39;s going to<br/>\nresult in crusty mummy, crusty baby and, as a result, crusty daddy. I know<br/>\nI shouldn&#39;t be projecting, but I feel his sleep-schedule is not only the<br/>\nlast truly structured thing in his life, but it&#39;s also the one thing that<br/>\nwill have the most impact if it all goes wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese last few weeks, since I have really &quot;let go&quot; and embraced the<br/>\nunschooling/peaceful parenting philosophy, my relationship with my son has<br/>\nbeen better than ever. Unbelievably better. Amazing even. I thought I was<br/>\nrelaxed before, but now I&#39;m on a completely different level. And I think as<br/>\na result of that, this &quot;enforced&quot; sleeping-schedule is rubbing him the<br/>\nwrong way, and in the last couple of days he&#39;s really started getting angry<br/>\nat bed-time. Tonight was the worst so far, hence this email!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I let my 15-month-old have freedom to choose his sleeping times<br/>\n(including having a bath at night - we live in the tropics so it&#39;s not<br/>\nideal to go to bed after sweating all day - though I do recognise that if<br/>\nthat DOES happen it&#39;s not the end of the world), without throwing our lives<br/>\n(especially our sleep!) into absolutely chaos? I know I&#39;m dramatizing, but<br/>\nI&#39;m truly struggling and I would appreciate any advice in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards,<br/>\nJenna.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65079,"nextTopicId":65101}}
