My oldest son had a huge crush on my youngest cousin (they are only 2mos apart in age) until about age 8 or so.  It did pass.  We let Andy have his little fantasy for now, knowing he&#39;ll outgrow it and that raining on his parade now would break his heart.  He&#39;s had other crushes, and recently a friend confided to me that her 7yo daughter has a crush on Andy.  We seem to have entered the boy/girl years already.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday, Andy told me he really likes an older girl we know, but says he&#39;s afraid to tell her.
