Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said all, so I&#39;ll ammend my statement <br/>\nto &quot;many children on occassion take things that are not theirs to take.&quot; <br/>\n For instance, Lexie was taking the coins and dollars that I would take <br/>\nout of my pocket and put them in her piggy banks.  When I asked her <br/>\nabout it, it was obvious she didn&#39;t realize there might be a problem <br/>\nwith that.  I told her just to ask as I might have plans for that money. <br/>\n Now she comes in and says &quot;can i have these coins?&quot;  Janene was taking <br/>\nthe money from the girl scout dues tin.  She didn&#39;t realize she was <br/>\ndoing anythign wrong.  When I discovered this, I asked her to not do <br/>\nthat anymore as it wasn&#39;t our money and that if she needed money to <br/>\nsimply ask me.  No big deal.  At age four, I&#39;m sure she thought that it <br/>\nwas just a nice place to get money to put in her special wallet.  (I <br/>\nalso replaced what she took).  But she was technically stealing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wrong to call it stealing.  But yes, I do think that the majority <br/>\nof children need to be taught that they have to pay for things before <br/>\nthey eat them or leave the store, and that the toddler rule of <br/>\npossession is not necessarily true.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I was also remembering my nephew when he was two took a candy bar <br/>\nfrom a store.  I didn&#39;t notice until he was out of the store. <br/>\n Technically this is stealing.  But the reality is--he didn&#39;t understand <br/>\nthe rules of aquisition.  (spelling?)  I understood it, the candy was <br/>\nright there, at his level, and so he took one.  There is candy at the <br/>\nbank that you can just take (in a bowl on the table, suckers, for the <br/>\nkids).  The rules of our society are often complex.  The other day we <br/>\nwere at the store and after getting the items I wanted, I said, OK, <br/>\nlet&#39;s go home and Janene said, astonished, &quot;but mommy, we have to PAY <br/>\nfirst.&quot;  Like I had meant, let&#39;s leave without paying.  But she&#39;s <br/>\ngetting the rules down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are also children that steal for other reasons.  A need that <br/>\nis not being met, whether attention or food or happiness.  but for most <br/>\nkids, it&#39;s simply a part of learning the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn, who has drone on long enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 11/20/02 6:58:12 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; All kids steal. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; THAT is extremely stereotypical!
