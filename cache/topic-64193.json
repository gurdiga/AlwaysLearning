There does seem to be a strong relationship between violence and violent video games.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what I&#39;m observing with Neo is very different. He is drawn to these games *because* they don&#39;t hurt real people so he can play with the ideas of combat strategy and skills without harming anyone to do it. For him it&#39;s a safe way to explore these fascinating puzzles. For him the draw is finding better puzzles to solve not finding ways to cause real pain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There seems to be two types of people who are drawn to violent entertainment. One are people like Neo who have no desire to hurt real living things but are fascinated by the mathematical strategies of the hunt. They&#39;re people who appreciate separating the skills from the bad consequences they don&#39;t want to inflict on real living things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other kids are hurting, angry, disconnected, often kids who adults connect to through their behavior rather than connect to through who the kids are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe Sebastian has met up with a slew of bad teachers who have punished him for bad behavior rather than trying to see the need beneath the behavior, trying to help him meet the needs in safe and respectful ways. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I&#39;m betting he feels the person inside him is unloved and so feels why should he care about anyone else. And these angry, hurt feelings are drawn to violence and self destruction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is something we&#39;re very conscious of with Neo. We want him to see us as his partners, people who will help him find respectful ways to meet his *underlying* needs, rather than feeling his needs have to pass some test of approval. We don&#39;t want him to feel our answer is likely to be no since, if the need is great enough, he&#39;ll go to someone else who doesn&#39;t have his best interest at heart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you read Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The relationship approach by Mira Kirchenbaum?

In other words, he suggests that the environment or atmosphere in which violent videogames are played is more of a determinant of the player&#39;s subsequent behaviour than the games themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share that opinion.  I have a 16 year old son who has had a passion for &#39;violent&#39; videogames for as long as I can remember (he&#39;s in his room playing one as I write - Assassins Creed 2).  He also happens to be the most amiable and kindhearted teenage boy I&#39;ve ever met.  Coincidence?  Maybe not.  Perhaps I could claim that playing violent videogames causes amiability and kindheartedness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else Marc Prensky tells me is that, in his experience, people who are &quot;anti&quot; videogames tend to be people who don&#39;t play videogames.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played nearly all the videogames my son has played.  I wouldn&#39;t have had it otherwise.  It&#39;s only in the past year or so that I haven&#39;t because his skills are so far ahead of mine now I became an embarrassment to play with and it was no fun for either of us any more.  Such is life.  There are only so many humiliating defeats a grown man can take. :-)  In any event, I shared the exploration of violent behaviour through pixels on an electronic screen with my son for many years and I enjoyed myself.  I&#39;ve run through the streets of Saints Row merrily lobbing hand grenades at innocent passers by, I&#39;ve blown the heads off Nazi zombies with a double barreled shotgun, I&#39;ve crushed Russian soldiers under tanks, not to mention all the thousands of non-human representations I&#39;ve slashed, shot, blown up or zapped.  The number of times this has given me even the slightest urge to do something similar in reality is zero.  It&#39;s never happened.  But of course I&#39;m a mature adult, aren&#39;t I?  Children are children and don&#39;t know any better.  Hmm ...  Not necessarily.  My son knows better than I do and always has done that they&#39;re games not real life.  It&#39;s me who has the associations in my mind that can add unnecessary interpretations to what&#39;s happening.  My son enjoys the games for the playing of the games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I consider the potential effects of violence in videogames on the developing mind of a child, I don&#39;t have to guess.  I don&#39;t have to consult an &quot;expert&quot; who will quote research that I strongly suspect has been undertaken from an anti-videogame bias to begin with and about whose parameters and methodologies I know nothing (there&#39;s nothing scientific about the so-called &quot;social sciences&quot;, by the way, but that&#39;s another story).  I know what I know from real life experience, and I know that violence in videogames - even a ton of it every day - doesn&#39;t cause actual violence.  Can it be a contributing factor?  Yes, I think it can be if the games are a *reflection* of violent life circumstances.  Where life circumstances are warm and friendly and conducive to happiness, such as they have been for my son, those circumstances prevail.  And I have to say that they have prevailed without any need to &#39;counteract&#39; or fight against any supposed negative effects of videogaming.  In the 13 years that my son has been a &quot;gamer&quot;, videogaming has simply never been an issue, in the same way that reading books has never been an issue, and watching TV has never been an issue, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be perfectly frank, when somebody says to me, &quot;Violent videogames cause violent behaviour&quot;, my initial thought is, &quot;That&#39;s bullsh*t&quot;.  And I mean it.  Seriously.  It&#39;s a mantra that belongs in a museum of simpleminded mantras along with &quot;Rock and Roll will rot your brain&quot; and the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman behaviour is far more complex than that, and sometimes digging a little deeper into that behaviour instead of looking for a scapegoat is a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ten cents worth on the topic anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Email from concerned family member","postDate":"1323449532","msgId":64197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0RDcxNUUzLTI3QkMtNEQ0MS04ODI3LTc5MkU5RTNDNkM4RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpic2NvcCtrb3JtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpic2NvcCtrb3JtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64196,"nextInTopic":64234,"prevInTime":64196,"nextInTime":64198,"topicId":64193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He and my cousin have a 15 year old (his son from a previous marriage) who has been arrested twice, has ran away and has been experimenting with drugs.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-983633147\">-=-He and my cousin have a 15 year old (his son from a previous marriage) who has been arrested twice, has ran away and has been experimenting with drugs.

There does seem to be a strong relationship between violence and violent video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I&#39;m observing with Neo is very different. He is drawn to these games *because* they don&#39;t hurt real people so he can play with the ideas of combat strategy and skills without harming anyone to do it. For him it&#39;s a safe way to explore these fascinating puzzles. For him the draw is finding better puzzles to solve not finding ways to cause real pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seems to be two types of people who are drawn to violent entertainment. One are people like Neo who have no desire to hurt real living things but are fascinated by the mathematical strategies of the hunt. They&#39;re people who appreciate separating the skills from the bad consequences they don&#39;t want to inflict on real living things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other kids are hurting, angry, disconnected, often kids who adults connect to through their behavior rather than connect to through who the kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Sebastian has met up with a slew of bad teachers who have punished him for bad behavior rather than trying to see the need beneath the behavior, trying to help him meet the needs in safe and respectful ways. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I&#39;m betting he feels the person inside him is unloved and so feels why should he care about anyone else. And these angry, hurt feelings are drawn to violence and self destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something we&#39;re very conscious of with Neo. We want him to see us as his partners, people who will help him find respectful ways to meet his *underlying* needs, rather than feeling his needs have to pass some test of approval. We don&#39;t want him to feel our answer is likely to be no since, if the need is great enough, he&#39;ll go to someone else who doesn&#39;t have his best interest at heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The relationship approach by Mira Kirchenbaum?

Have you noticed any change in Neos Behaviour?:  over sensitivity? - cursing?<br/>\nwithdrawn to only wanting to play the games? - mood swings? <br/>\nI&#39;ve had talks with 2 other parents whos kids play online with Sebastian and identified all of these symptoms on their kids not to mention the beginning of drug use mostly experimenting getting high with house products which apparently is a big thing<br/>\nwith gamers being that they are too young to get their hands on street drugs and they get high with some house cleaning products prior to playing the games to prove themselves as being able to fight under any condition, this is how they are initiated into<br/>\nthe elite clans and many of then end up dead on their kitchen floor. Nuria it is very difficult to raise a teen in this age and age, and these games raise the hormones of these kids through the roof making a disaster out of a hot mess for a parent. You have a beautiful family<br/>\ndon&#39;t let this nightmare into your home. the first thing that went through my head when the shit hit the fan with Sebastian was: &quot;Damn, I should have had a no violent game rule with Sebastian&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNuria</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64483,"nextTopicId":64364}}
