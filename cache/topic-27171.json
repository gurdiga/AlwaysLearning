When teachers or homeschooling parents try to force kids to  <br/>\nthink about things that don&#39;t matter to them, they, naturally, don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink any harder than they must in order to get a decent grade (if  <br/>\nthey care about grades) - and the whole thinking process can feel  <br/>\nvery inauthentic to schooled kids - like it isn&#39;t really their own  <br/>\nthinking that they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons that clear critical thinking skills are so  <br/>\nimportant is so as not to be swayed or manipulated by statements such  <br/>\nas this HSLDA alert.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the most important critical thinking skill is to always read  <br/>\neverything while keeping in mind the author&#39;s underlying motivation.  <br/>\nIn other words, read ALL seemingly objective statements as, in fact,  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s beliefs that are based on their own biases, self-interest,  <br/>\nworld view, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, once we&#39;re aware of the basic facts - that HSLDA is a  <br/>\nright-wing political organization that uses homeschooling as a  <br/>\nplatform for promoting their overarching agenda, then we can evaluate  <br/>\neverything they say with that in mind. (If anybody hasn&#39;t look into  <br/>\ntheir activities, just spend a few minutes googling &quot;The Generation  <br/>\nJoshua Project&quot; and the goals of Patrick Henry College.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing our knowledge about this organization and the people and  <br/>\nactivities they support, we can understand that providing legal help  <br/>\nis their way of garnering a devoted following which they then use to  <br/>\nsupport certain political goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things to keep in mind - a fact and an idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nCongresswoman Republican Marilyn Musgrave is an extremist - extremely  <br/>\nanti-United Nations, anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage, anti-science,  <br/>\nand anti-environmentalism. You decide if you&#39;re actually worried  <br/>\nabout her being voted out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt puts homeschooling legal freedom more at risk for HSLDA to create  <br/>\nthe impression that all homeschoolers are right-wing Republicans/ <br/>\nmembers of the Christian Right and that Democrats are all anti- <br/>\nhomeschooling. It is HSLDA, itself, that is endangering our freedom,  <br/>\nby setting up this false conflict. When Democrats DO take over, it  <br/>\nwould be better for homeschoolers if they were NOT under the  <br/>\nimpression that we are all in synch with HSLDA&#39;s platform.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point isn&#39;t to discuss HSLDA - not appropriate for this list. Just  <br/>\nusing them as a jumping off point for thinking about critical thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how we respond to HSLDA&#39;s alerts is based on our own critical  <br/>\nthinking skills. I&#39;m just saying - if we are finding it hard to  <br/>\nfigure out what HSLDA is up to, then we might give some thought and  <br/>\ntime to developing our own clarity of thinking, research ability, and  <br/>\ndecisionmaking skills - in order to better help our kids learn to be  <br/>\ndiscerning and competent thinkers, themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280852700,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"&quot;Schuyler&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How true is this?

But if tis is true it is scary.  <br/>\nI hope you can shed light on this.  <br/>\nOctober 12, 2006<br/>\n<br/>\nHSLDA--Help Defend Homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nDear HSLDA member,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have less than four weeks to go before the crucial mid-term<br/>\nelections.<br/>\nThe results of this November 7 will significantly impact the direction<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe country because, for the first time in over a decade, control of<br/>\nboth<br/>\nthe U.S. Senate and U.S. House is realistically at stake. A change in<br/>\nparty<br/>\ncontrol could have a wide ranging impact on homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on Home School Legal Defense Association&#39; s experience of<br/>\nprotecting and defending homeschooling on the state and federal <br/>\nlevels,<br/>\nI can<br/>\nassure you that the Republican majorities in Congress are friends of<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not only demonstrated through their actions, with <br/>\nCongresswoman<br/>\nMarilyn Musgrave sponsoring HoNDA, which helped many homeschool <br/>\nfamilies<br/>\nwho were facing discrimination via quirks in federal law, but is also<br/>\nclearlystated in the party platform: &quot;We [the Republican Party] defend<br/>\nthe option for homeschooling and call for vigilant enforcement of laws<br/>\ndesigned to protect family rights<br/>\nand privacy in education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis strong, positive stance on homeschooling is not shared by many<br/>\nDemocrats and their education union allies. It is very clear that the<br/>\nDemocrat Party&#39;s ties with the National Education Association have and<br/>\nwill<br/>\ncontinue to influence its stance on educational freedom, and we know <br/>\nhow<br/>\nthe<br/>\nNEA feels about homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to remind you what will occur should Democrats take the<br/>\nmajority in the U.S. House: George Miller of California will likely be<br/>\nthe<br/>\nChairman of the Education Committee. Twelve years ago, George Miller<br/>\nattempted to<br/>\nintroduce an amendment that would have required that all teachers,<br/>\nincluding homeschool moms, be certified teachers.<br/>\nHe will try something similar if he ever gains the chairmanship of <br/>\nthis<br/>\nimportant committee.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur homeschooling freedom is fragile. One amendment passed by a<br/>\nDemocrat-controlled House and Senate could find its way into law.<br/>\nHSLDA will do everything, with your help, to stop this from happening,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nour job, to defend your right to homeschool, will be much easier with<br/>\ngovernment leaders who support our position. We are all in this <br/>\ntogether<br/>\nand the homeschool community must play its role to defend our<br/>\nown freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lines are clearly drawn for us on the homeschool, life, and <br/>\nmarriage<br/>\nissues. I am convinced that we must do all that we can to ensure that<br/>\nRepublicans maintain control of Congress on November 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo that end, HSLDA PAC has endorsed candidates in key races around the<br/>\ncountry, and in the last week of the campaign, the PAC is sending out<br/>\nnumerous teams of homeschool students to participate in key House and<br/>\nSenate<br/>\nraces. These young people will be working hard to &quot;Get-Out-The- Vote.&quot;<br/>\nThey<br/>\nwill campaign door to door, make literature drops and call thousands <br/>\nof<br/>\nvoters. This work must occur if we are to prevail. Time and time <br/>\nagain,<br/>\nit<br/>\nhas been shown that an effective grassroots effort can sway a <br/>\npolitical<br/>\nrace, even if the polling data is against your candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m asking that you not only vote and volunteer for the pro-family<br/>\ncandidate in your area, but that you help support these young people <br/>\nin<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nefforts.The PAC will be helping pay their travel, lodging, and food<br/>\nexpenses for<br/>\nthe last week of the campaign. It is possible to donate online to the<br/>\nHSLDA<br/>\nPAC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27163,"nextTopicId":27179}}
