They may have been the chief  <br/>\nlinks between Wright&#39;s work and the general popularity of the notion  <br/>\ntoday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2008, it was announced that the word had been added to Merriam- <br/>\nWebster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary.[4][5]<br/>\n<br/>\nRole in culture<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile mondegreens are a common occurrence for children, many adults  <br/>\nhave their own collection, particularly with regard to popular music.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a few mondegreens may be seen in closed-captioned live  <br/>\ntelevision broadcasting of impromptu speeches, interviews, etc. (for  <br/>\nexample, a local news report of a &quot;grand parade&quot; might be captioned  <br/>\nas a &quot;Grandpa raid&quot;). The prevalence of mondegreens in this context  <br/>\narises in part from the use of stenotype machines and the need for  <br/>\ncaptions to keep up with the fast pace of programs. This machine is  <br/>\nused not to type out words directly as a common keyboard but rather  <br/>\nto record the syllables of the words being spoken. Thus, the  <br/>\nstenographic recording is a phonetic transcription of the words being  <br/>\nspoken. Software is then used to translate the phonetic syllables  <br/>\ninto proper words. Given some unusual syllabic constructions, and the  <br/>\nsophistication of the software, errors come in as the system tries to  <br/>\ndistinguish where the word break is in the syllable stream.  <br/>\nTypically, the software uses pre-programmed information that matches  <br/>\nsyllable clusters to written forms, then suggests captions from which  <br/>\na human &quot;captionist&quot; chooses. Mistakes may come from inadequacies in  <br/>\nthe program&#39;s recognition capability, from the failure to provide the  <br/>\nsoftware with vocabulary specific to the context, from the  <br/>\ncaptionist&#39;s own mishearing of the words, or from the need for the  <br/>\ncaptionist to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made  <br/>\nclear by what is said next.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn popular culture<br/>\n<br/>\nSee also: Soramimi<br/>\n<br/>\nSome mondegreens arise from &quot;false friends&quot; or false cognates. In  <br/>\nboth cases a phrase in one language may be misheard as a semi- <br/>\nsensical phrase in another language, called a Soramimi. The humorous  <br/>\naspect of these has given rise to a music video genre known as  <br/>\nanimutation, in which music in a different language (often Japanese,  <br/>\nalthough others such as Swedish exist) is &quot;misheard&quot; into English,  <br/>\nand illustrated. Engrish mondegreens can also occur when English  <br/>\nlyrics are reproduced by singers of Asian languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may happen in the opposite direction as well: i.e., English  <br/>\nwords of a song are misheard, intentionally or not, to mean something  <br/>\nelse in a native language, often with a humorous effect. An example  <br/>\nis a Russian joke in which the song &quot;Can&#39;t Buy Me Love&quot; was announced  <br/>\nas &quot;кинь бабе лом&quot; (pronounced [kinʲ babʲe lom]), which  <br/>\nroughly translates as &quot;Throw a crowbar to the old woman&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples in song lyrics<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tThe &quot;top 3&quot; mondegreens submitted regularly to mondegreen expert  <br/>\nJon Carroll are:[1]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1.\tGladly the cross-eyed bear[3] (from the line in the hymn &quot;Keep  <br/>\nThou My Way&quot; by Fanny Crosby, &quot;Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the  <br/>\ncross I&#39;ll bear&quot;)[6] Carroll and many others quote it as &quot;Gladly the  <br/>\ncross I&#39;d bear&quot;. Ed McBain used the mondegreen as the title of a  <br/>\nnovel. Also, this mondegreen is paraphrased by the band They Might Be  <br/>\nGiants in their song &quot;Hide Away Folk Family&quot; (Sadly the cross-eyed  <br/>\nbear&#39;s been put to sleep behind the stairs, and his shoes are laced  <br/>\nwith irony.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2.\tThere&#39;s a bathroom on the right (the line at the end of each  <br/>\nverse of &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by Creedence Clearwater Revival: &quot;There&#39;s  <br/>\na bad moon on the rise&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t3.\t&#39;Scuse me while I kiss this guy (from a lyric in the song &quot;Purple  <br/>\nHaze&quot;, by Jimi Hendrix: &quot;&#39;Scuse me while I kiss the sky&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Creedence&#39;s John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually capitalized on  <br/>\nthese mishearings and deliberately sang the &quot;mondegreen&quot; versions of  <br/>\ntheir songs in concert.[7][8][9]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tThe film &quot;Angels In The Outfield&quot; makes a reference to the  <br/>\nmishearing of mistakes &quot;O, say can you see&quot; from The Star-Spangled  <br/>\nBanner as &quot;José can you see?&quot;.[10] Bill Dana used this mondegreen in  <br/>\na comedy bit as the Hispanic character José Jimenez. Columnist Mike  <br/>\nRoyko made the same joke about José Cardenal after the ballplayer had  <br/>\nrecovered from an eye infection. In Beverly Cleary&#39;s children&#39;s novel  <br/>\nRamona the Pest, Ramona refers to the &quot;Dawnzer lee light&quot; (dawn&#39;s  <br/>\nearly light).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tIn Stevie Nicks&#39; song Edge of Seventeen the line &quot;Just Like a  <br/>\nWhite Winged Dove&quot; is often misheard as &quot;Just like a One Winged  <br/>\nDove&quot;. [11][12][13][14] The title itself originated from a mishearing  <br/>\nof &quot;age of seventeen&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tIn an episode of the television sitcom Friends, Phoebe believes  <br/>\nthe lyric from Elton John&#39;s &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, &quot;Hold me closer, tiny  <br/>\ndancer&quot; is actually &quot;Hold me close, young Tony Danza.&quot;[15]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tIn the CBS sitcom The Nanny, &quot;The girl with kaleidoscope eyes,&quot;  <br/>\nfrom the song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; by The Beatles, is  <br/>\nmisheard as &quot;The girl with colitis goes by.&quot;[1]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\t&quot;A wean in a manger,&quot; using the Scottish word for a baby, instead  <br/>\nof &quot;Away in a Manger.&quot; Gervase Phinn used &quot;A Wayne in a Manger&quot; as  <br/>\nthe title of a book about a children&#39;s nativity play.[16]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\t&quot;Tell the Huns it&#39;s time for me&quot; (from the song &quot;Beneath the  <br/>\nLights of Home (In a Little Sleepy Town)&quot; sung by Deanna Durbin in  <br/>\nNice Girl? (1941): &quot;Turn the hands of time for me&quot;) on the BBC radio  <br/>\nprogramme Quote Unquote in 2002.[17]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tMairzy Doats, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman and  <br/>\nJerry Livingston, works the other way around. The lyrics are already  <br/>\na mondegreen (the song is sung in a fake West-country accent), and  <br/>\nit&#39;s up to the listener to figure out what they mean. The refrain of  <br/>\nthe song repeats nonsensical sounding lines:<br/>\n<br/>\nMairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey<br/>\nA kiddley divey too, wooden shoe (or, if you prefer, &quot;wouldn&#39;t chew&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only clue to the actual meaning of the words is contained in the  <br/>\nbridge:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled  <br/>\nand jivey,<br/>\nSing &quot;Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n From this point, the ear can figure out that the last line of the  <br/>\nrefrain is &quot;A kid&#39;ll eat ivy too; wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;, but this last line  <br/>\nis only sung in the song as a mondegreen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tThe Joni Mitchell cover of the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross song  <br/>\n&quot;Twisted&quot; includes a mondegreen: the original lyric They all laughed  <br/>\nat A. Graham Bell was misheard and subsequently recorded by Mitchell  <br/>\nas They all laugh at angry young men.[18]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tMike Sutton, a mondegreen director on YouTube with the username  <br/>\n&quot;Buffalax&quot;, uploaded several non-English music videos which were  <br/>\nedited to include subtitles of the written English approximation of  <br/>\nthe video&#39;s original language&#39;s sound. These include Internet memes  <br/>\nsuch as Moskau (originally German), Tunak Tunak Tun (originally  <br/>\nPunjabi), Indian Thriller (originally Telugu) and Benny Lava  <br/>\n(originally Tamil). The latter, involving the video for Prabhu Deva  <br/>\nSundaram&#39;s song, &quot;Kalluri Vaanil&quot; from the Indian Tamil movie, Pennin  <br/>\nManathai Thottu, has occasionally been referred to as &quot;the web&#39;s  <br/>\nhottest clip&quot; [19] On the Internet, both the terms &quot;Buffalaxed&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;Benny lava&quot; are now synonymous with mondegreens, &quot;words or phrases  <br/>\nmisheard in ways that yield new meanings.&quot;[20][21]<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples in television<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\t&quot;Mondegreens&quot; is the name of a segment on the Australian music  <br/>\nquiz show Spicks and Specks (ABC TV).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther examples<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tA controversial example is found in the movie Who Framed Roger  <br/>\nRabbit, where Donald Duck in a scene chastises Daffy Duck, exclaiming  <br/>\n&quot;Doggone stubborn little...&quot; Donald&#39;s quacks have frequently been  <br/>\nmisheard as &quot;God damn stupid nigger&quot;, resulting in a hard-to-put-down  <br/>\nurban legend.[22]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t•\tThe games Mad Gab and Babble-On feature mondegreens as puzzles  <br/>\nfor players to solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples in languages other than English<br/>\n<br/>\nHebrew<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Naturally, mondegreens are a universal phenomenon. They often occur  <br/>\nwith songs taught to groups of children by nannies or teachers. An  <br/>\nIsraeli example is mukhrakhím liyót saméakh ‘We must be happy’  <br/>\ninstead of (the high-register) úru akhím belév saméakh ‘Wake up,  <br/>\nbrothers, with a happy heart’, from the well-known song Háva  <br/>\nNagíla (Let’s be Happy). Thus, a foreigner interested in learning  <br/>\nthe original song had better not ask an Israeli for its lyrics.  <br/>\nConsider also the ‘non-phonetic mondegreen’ (employing  <br/>\n‘mondegreen’ more broadly) with the Israeli children’s song  <br/>\núga, úga, úga, bámagal nakhúga. The original meaning is ‘Round,  <br/>\nround, round, let us move in a circle’ but it is interpreted by most  <br/>\nIsraeli children as the homophonous ‘cake, cake, cake, let us move  <br/>\nin a circle’, cf. Israeli [Hebrew] ugá ‘cake’ (note that úga  <br/>\n‘round, roll, draw a circle! (masculine, singular)’ is outdated).  <br/>\nThis song might have made many Israeli children perceive the default,  <br/>\nunmarked cake as round – like Yiddish kúgļ ‘kugel, kind of  <br/>\npudding’ (popularly etymologized as Israeli [Hebrew] keigul ‘like  <br/>\na circle’) and Yiddish shtrúdļ ‘strudel, type of fruit  <br/>\ncake’.&quot;[23]<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Mistaken Sayings, Proverbs, etymology","postDate":"1223542775","msgId":39270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMTQ3NEYyLTMxMkItNDQwQy1CNTEwLTY4REY4QzMwRDA2NUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjajZ0MStibXZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdjajZ0MStibXZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39268,"nextInTopic":39271,"prevInTime":39269,"nextInTime":39271,"topicId":38914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

To report immediately to my superior any weld that I believe is not  <br/>\nthoroughly dependable for the service for which it is intended.<br/>\n3. To do all in my power to advance the cause of welding.<br/>\n4. To give my employer, at all times, my best effort, loyal service,  <br/>\nand honest workmanship.<br/>\n5. To strive each day to increase my knowledge and skill in the art of  <br/>\nwelding.<br/>\n6. To extend all possible assistance to welders less proficient than  <br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n7. Realizing the appearance as well as quality is important in a weld,  <br/>\nalways strive to improve my workmanship.<br/>\n8. Always to be punctual.<br/>\n9.
