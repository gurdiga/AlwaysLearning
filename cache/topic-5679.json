We were staying in<br/>\nTyson&#39;s Corner, VA since that&#39;s where my DH&#39;s conference was.  Alexandria<br/>\nis just across the Potomac from Washington, not sure how far as the roads<br/>\ngo though.  It&#39;s a neat city.  The Torpedo Factory was cool - it&#39;s an<br/>\nold WW2 torpedo factory that has been changed into artist&#39;s studios. Some<br/>\nof the artists just sell things there; others actually make their art<br/>\nthere too.  It&#39;s on the river.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a fabric person one of the best fabric stores in the world<br/>\nis in Rockville, MD.  It&#39;s called G Street Fabrics - I visited it twice!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe flew in and out of Baltimore rather than Dulles or National - it<br/>\nwas cheaper and not that much farther away from where we needed to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Washington a lot.  If you want to visit the Capitol or White House<br/>\ncontact your congress critter.  They can get you tickets for those without<br/>\nstanding in line once you get there (my experience is pre-9/11 though).<br/>\nAlso if anyone in your family is really, really into airplanes, there<br/>\nare Saturday tours of the Paul E. Garber facility in Silver Springs, MD.<br/>\nThis is an annex to the Air and Space Museum and is where all the<br/>\nrestoration work is done on their exhibits.  We got to see the Enola<br/>\nGay as it was being worked on!  They also store some of their planes<br/>\nthere when they are being shown.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are trying to figure out what we want to do for travel this year.<br/>\nIt probably won&#39;t be until September since my DH&#39;s work schedule is<br/>\npretty tight still.

We&#39;re about 10 miles from DC westwards.<br/>\nI would park in DC on the mall and get out fora couple of hours. Well worth it<br/>\nto gawp at the White Houseand Capitol building.
