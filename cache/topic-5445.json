We have a lake here, too with a public <br/>\n&quot;beach&quot;. (I like water!) Y&#39;all don&#39;t HAVE to go home at all---stay around a <br/>\nweek or so and visit! We have a big garage, big back yard for tents, and lots <br/>\nof floor space ( just NOT for the conference weekend! I&#39;M not even staying at <br/>\nhome!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr do you mean some time OTHER than conference weekend? Columbia&#39;s fairly <br/>\ncentrally located on the east coast if you&#39;re talking about NY to <br/>\nDisneyworld/land (whatever)---10 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the registration form I&#39;m asking for your unschooling.com/AlwaysLearning <br/>\nscreen name.

And the ball <br/>\nroom was full of foam balls or those ball-pit balls like at McD&#39;s (can&#39;t <br/>\nremember now).  There was also a quiet room, where kids could go if they <br/>\nwanted to do quiet things.  And a girls only room, and a boys only room, <br/>\ntoo.  And a game room.  And a piano that anyone could play set up in the <br/>\nmiddle of the common areas of the conference part of the hotel. And one <br/>\nyear there was a room set up as a Waldorf style kindergarten.
