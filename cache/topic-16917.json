Violence... <br/>\nColumbine... where do kids get the idea to kill other kids??  TV.***<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Britain passed the Juvenile Offences Act of 1847 which said young<br/>\npeople shouldn&#39;t go to the same prison as adults.  They did it because of<br/>\npublic concern over the huge numbers of young kids going to jail (not<br/>\njust on murder charges) with adult criminals.  Some figures show the<br/>\ncrime rate in England jumped from 5,000  crimes a year around 1800 to<br/>\n20,000 a year sometime in the 1830s.   No one can blame tv for that one. <br/>\n<br/>\nFourteen year old Jesse Pomeroy  was arrested in 1874 for the murder of a<br/>\nfour-year-old.  He was released and immediately killed a ten year old<br/>\ngirl and then another four year old.  No tv. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1924 nineteen year olds Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold murdered Bobby<br/>\nFranks just to see what it was like.   They were from well off families,<br/>\nnice neighborhoods.  Never saw tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Bath, Michigan in May, 1927 Andrew Kehoe who was fifty (five?- don&#39;t<br/>\nremember) committed the worst case of school violence in American<br/>\nhistory.  First he killed his wife, locked his animals in the barn and<br/>\nblew them up,  blew up the school where he was a handyman and blew up his<br/>\ntruck full of shrapnel.  More explosives were set to go off to kill<br/>\nrescue workers but were found by the police.  In all, thirty eight<br/>\nchildren were killed and seven teachers.  Sixty some others were injured.<br/>\n  Mr. Kehoe never saw a tv set. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes TV create violence, really?  Maybe guns create violence.  Knives. <br/>\nBaseball bats.  Hammers. Axes, shovels, saws?  Rope?  Dynamite?  Sharp<br/>\nsticks, rocks?  Maybe it&#39;s language causes violence because most killers<br/>\nspoke.  Maybe it&#39;s books. Clothing? Day time night time wind rain snow<br/>\ntrees birds frogs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHistory is full of killers, some really damn weird ones who never saw TV.<br/>\n The Borgias come to mind easily, and so maybe religion or Pope-ness,<br/>\nPope hood? is the cause of crime.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor lots of kids, even the bad guys on TV are nicer than the real life<br/>\ncrazy people they live and go to school with. <br/>\n <br/>\nDeb L, TV loving, movie watching, book reading,  true crime fan who never<br/>\nonce shot or stabbed or poisoned anyone.

I&#39;ve been looking for Kevin a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I was asking was because Jesse would know where Kevin was.  <br/>\nKevin&#39;s name is Kevin Williams, and I lost contact with him when Holly was a baby.  <br/>\nHe was a funeral director.   Jesse is female.  I couldn&#39;t remember her last <br/>\nname when I wrote to Joe (though he would have because they were sweet at one <br/>\ntime), so I ddn&#39;t name Kevin&#39;s either, and after Joe&#39;s e-mail came back I <br/>\nthought if I could ONLY remember that story, I would remember Jesse&#39;s last name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is &quot;that story,&quot; from Deb&#39;s e-mail:<br/>\n&quot;Fourteen year old Jesse Pomeroy  was arrested in 1874 for the murder of a<br/>\nfour-year-old.  He was released and immediately killed a ten year old<br/>\ngirl and then another four year old.  No tv. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Jesse is female.  Her last name is Pomeroy, but &quot;Jesse&quot; is a name <br/>\nshe adopted as a teen, because she is descended from relatives of that Jesse <br/>\nPomeroy.  Her great grandfather was his parent or sibling (I forget the details).<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse and I were in a group of five people who travelled to Pennsylvania <br/>\nabout 23 years ago in a van that broke down BADLY, repeatedly.  So we spent ten <br/>\ndays in Maryland with acquaintances while the van was in the shop twice there.  <br/>\nJesse and I went every day by bus and metro to the Smithsonian, and then <br/>\nstarted on the Library of Congress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking up wombats, how boy scouts are described by Russians and <br/>\nChinese (para-military political action organization).  Jesse was looking at <br/>\nmicrofilm of 19th century newspaper accounts of the Jesse Pomeroy stuff.  I liked <br/>\nlooking over her shoulder sometimes, at the side stories and those few ads which <br/>\nhadn&#39;t been excised.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse&#39;s mom was mean to her and Jesse ended up being the kid who stayed home, <br/>\nso partly out of reactionary spite, Jessy became macabre and dramatic.  She <br/>\ndrove a hearse.  She was a make-up artist for the dead.  She collected ancient <br/>\nEgyptian stuff to decorate their home (against her mom&#39;s will, generally) so <br/>\nthat it looked like an Egyptian-themed Louisiana whorehouse of the late 19th <br/>\ncentury.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she did then and still uses &quot;Jesse Pomeroy&quot; as her own name.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike kids.  I haven&#39;t seen her since I had any. She would never, ever have <br/>\nany.  She doesn&#39;t like much of anyone.  She had a sister who was in the habit of <br/>\nfinding international travel by being an efficient secretary who put out in <br/>\nthe extreme, with a perference for exotic locales and elevators.  Jesse herself <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have men touch her (nor women).  Joe flirted and tried, but Jesse <br/>\nwas impermeable to intimacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yesterday I wondered what her last name was, and today Deb presented me <br/>\nwith a much-memory-flood-inducing reminder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have met SO many weirdly fascinating people in my life, and there are so <br/>\nmany bizarre stories of people I have interacted with myself that there is no <br/>\nsoap opera on TV that matches my own real life.  Others have said the same, that <br/>\nmy life is way beyond what people would believe could have all happened to <br/>\none person.  So when people say TV lies and exaggerates, I think &quot;Well, it lacks <br/>\nimagination, very often.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still in contact with two of Joe&#39;s ex girlfriends.  I know all their <br/>\nchildren, current husbands, other exes....
