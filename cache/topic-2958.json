I know this is a very emotional and tense time.<br/>\nWhile I have not had a lump found, I have had a couple of life threatening<br/>\nmedical issues and my 2yo son has a life threatening illness.  The first<br/>\ntime around, nothing much helped me.  I was a mess.  I came very close to<br/>\nbleeding to death and was aware of it at the time.  I expected to be<br/>\nterrified but I was very calm, almost analytical (probably shock).  But I<br/>\nfound that to be very comforting the second time around.  I new that if<br/>\nworse came to worse, I wouldn&#39;t be scared and I know that my son wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be scared either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also a fairly spiritual person and I found that to be a help.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2948,"nextTopicId":2946}}
