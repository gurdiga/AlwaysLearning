I&#39;ve spent my life <br/>\nsteeped in the old trappings that kept me down.  Yesterday, I was <br/>\ntalking with Allie and tried to explain why I am reluctant to learn <br/>\na new skill.  I grew up with a mom who didn&#39;t understand why anyone <br/>\nwould want to do anything difficult.  Anytime I wanted to try <br/>\nsomething that she thought was going to be difficult or too <br/>\nchallenging, she&#39;d remind me that I&#39;d probably fail and then be <br/>\ndepressed.  She said it wasn&#39;t worth trying if the outcome would be <br/>\nmiserable.  And I won&#39;t even go into the times I had school teachers <br/>\ntell me I had no talent with the subject and suggest I switch to a <br/>\ndifferent class.  Ugh!  With my children, I try to focus on the <br/>\nexperience and not the outcome.  I just want them to enjoy life to <br/>\nthe fullest and not be afraid of trying things.  So Allie gave me a <br/>\nhug and a kiss and told me she&#39;d be happy to teach me how to knit as <br/>\nshe learns.
