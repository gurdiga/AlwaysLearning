I saw this advertised on Neopets.  It says &quot;Habbo-- <br/>\nhangout for teens&quot; and it seems one registers for free, creates an  <br/>\nicon that looks like a Lego person, and it looks like they can have  <br/>\ntext conversations with other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I don&#39;t know.  Holly, my youngest, is already using  <br/>\nMySpace as her virtual world (and many of her real-life friends keep  <br/>\nin touch with her there), but this looks simpler and cute.
