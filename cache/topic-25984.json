Often I knew it was  <br/>\nbecause the parents were made at each other and hadn&#39;t coordinated  <br/>\ntheir days well, because one parent would bring the kids in some  <br/>\npressured last-minute desperation, and the other parent would pick  <br/>\nthem up later, clearly flustered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I figured every time that what the kids needed was a break.  None  <br/>\nof them liked to discuss the parental problem if there was another  <br/>\nkid there.  A couple of the three might talk to me about it if he or  <br/>\nshe was the only one there, but if there were two kids in earshot,  <br/>\nthere was  a total cut-off from even thinking of the parents, it  <br/>\nseemed.   The parents are separated now; it didn&#39;t work out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what the kids needed, especially the boys, was escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir sister would sometimes just find a quiet place and draw or  <br/>\nwrite or look out the window, or if Holly was there they would so  <br/>\nsomething quiet and girly together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I knew they were coming, I would check with my kids about what  <br/>\nvideo systems could be set up for them to play, and I&#39;d try to have  <br/>\nat least two systems, all set up and ready to go.  They could play  <br/>\nalone or two together, but if I could let them just play and play and  <br/>\nplay, it seemed the best possible thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt their house, even computer games were considered stupid.  At my  <br/>\nhouse, I let them do what they wanted to do.  I fed them or didn&#39;t.   <br/>\nI tried to make sure the temperature in the room was good and there  <br/>\nwas ventilation and they had a bottle of bought water.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents would never have DARED suggest I do anything different,  <br/>\nbecause I would have risen up and defended their kids to them, and  <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to risk for a second stirring up my commentary on  <br/>\nhow they were being as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell!  I  didn&#39;t realize I still harbored some of the emotional  <br/>\ndefense I had about that. &lt;g&gt;  For a while, I was picking the mid-kid  <br/>\nup after school one day a week and taking him to an animation project  <br/>\nhe was working on at the university.  He didn&#39;t want to be going to  <br/>\nschool.  His brother and sister were still homeschooled, but he was  <br/>\nhis dad&#39;s least favorite [clearly; not just my opinion] and he had  <br/>\nmade him to to Albuquerque Academy against his will, &quot;for his own good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were younger, they and Holly used to do radio shows  <br/>\n(there&#39;s one tape recorded somewhere) with commercials, usually  <br/>\ninvolving pets or stuffed animals playing real animals.  There&#39;s a  <br/>\nvideo they made once, before Holly knocked the video camera down and  <br/>\nit broke.  Again, a play about a pet shop.  &lt;g&gt;  They had no pets at  <br/>\ntheir house, so our dog and cats were also popular attractions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t babysitting so much as refuge, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] creating constructive stress/conversations about unschooling","postDate":"1148838358","msgId":25986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNjc4NUYzLTY3QkQtNDEzMy05MEQyLTY0MUQxNzk1QzE3N0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwQTREODBELTZDNTctNDA4MS04RDlDLUYzMEYzRDU0MTgwNEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM2ODI3NCQ3MDM4MWE2MCQ2NzAxYThjMEBNT01TT1dOPiA8OTBBNEQ4MEQtNkM1Ny00MDgxLThEOUMtRjMwRjNENTQxODA0QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25985,"nextInTopic":25987,"prevInTime":25985,"nextInTime":25987,"topicId":25984,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
