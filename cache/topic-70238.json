Being full of meanness<br/>\nis a terrible way to live. When you&#39;re angry, anything that passes through<br/>\nyour consciousness can be misidentified as the �cause� of your anger. Then<br/>\nSandra, or Joyce, or Pam or anyone points out you&#39;re being mean to your<br/>\nchild, or your partner, or even yourself, and you feel bad, and you<br/>\nincorrectly identify the source of your bad feeling as someone being �mean�<br/>\nto you...by pointing out that you are being mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe full cup metaphor is mentioned often here. It is a really useful tool.<br/>\nWhen somebody comes here with their cup full of poison, they sometimes get<br/>\nit slapped out of their hand. The list leaders assume, since you came here<br/>\nof your own free will, that you want to, y&#39;know, stop drinking poison. This<br/>\nis the opposite of mean. If someone pushes you out of the path of a<br/>\nspeeding truck, do you get up and harangue them about your scuffed shoe?<br/>\nTurns out, yeah, some people do. Hopefully, next time, we do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have posted some super-weak stuff on this list. I&#39;m so embarrassed I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even stand to re-read it yet. I&#39;d like to invite my husband to join<br/>\nthe list but I&#39;m mortified to have him read what I wrote. Whoops. I learned<br/>\na lot anyway. I felt bad and sad and mean after reading what was written in<br/>\nresponse to me. It helped me tremendously. Not feeling bad in itself, but<br/>\nthe bad feeling is the information that tells you where you&#39;re going wrong,<br/>\nlike the pain that tells you to get the sand out of your eye, or your hand<br/>\nout of the fire. I&#39;ve been able to make my life much better since Sandra<br/>\nwas �mean� to me, and when I can explain why, I&#39;ll be able to give advice<br/>\non the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how any of this can be changed by changing the rules of the<br/>\nlist. Whatever amount of time you ask people to wait before posting, some<br/>\npeople will decide it doesn&#39;t apply to them. I think anyone who comes to<br/>\nthe list so panicky that two weeks seems like too long to wait before<br/>\nposting is going to post anger and fear. I can certainly understand if the<br/>\nlist leaders are weary of it, but watching someone sort out their anger in<br/>\npublic can be highly instructive. Maybe the newbie required reading could<br/>\ninclude some of the �best of the worst� of people freaking out in public<br/>\nhere on the list.

Not too long after first joining AL, I had become frustrated by something posted here (can&#39;t remember the specifics now) and had the urge to jump into the discussion. But I was a newbie, and didn&#39;t want to give in to the urge to jump in quite yet, plus I was frustrated by the thread, and that wouldn&#39;t have been helpful for the discussion. So not too long after first joining the list, I chose to click &quot;Leave This Group&quot;... but Yahoo continued to send the daily digests to my inbox. I simply kept reading those daily digests (without the easy-click ability to join any discussion.) So I continued to read along with the daily digests, and I read your Big Book of Unschooling, and I added Just Add Light to my inbox as well (I also found that to be a helpful/gentle reminder to be sweeter/be their partner.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI officially &quot;rejoined&quot; your list tonight, so I could post this response. Nothing is different for me, except I now have activated full access to post as an active member again.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, this the first time I&#39;ve ever posted here. However, probably just like many hundreds/thousands of your other not-so-new list members, it isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been *tempted* to post. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour welcome message and guidelines for the group seem very clear and acceptable. And they make sense, especially given the nature of what this list is about. Your reminder to &quot;read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch&quot; is what kept me from falling into the old pattern of being over-reactionary when I was a new member. You clearly state that this is not a social network, unfortunately I agree that many new members simply don&#39;t read the guidelines. (There is so much to learn... take some time, take a breath.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor months now, I spend careful time each day reading this AL digest. I&#39;m hooked, I look forward to it with my coffee, and it&#39;s working for me. But I must say, I can often sniff out the newbies who probably didn&#39;t read those guidelines. And with their posts, I smile, and sigh, and say &quot;here we go...!&quot; <br/>\n-- So in that light, no I don&#39;t think a week or two is a long time to adhere to the moderators&#39; request of not posting. I think your FAQ link was helpful to read. Read, read, read! -- There is so much in your archives that can answer so very much if the time is taken to dig, to listen, to read for a while. I still fall down the rabbit hole of your website, reading old threads and following links that answer tons of questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, as mildly annoying as I find some of the repeated/offended remarks, and there does seem to be quite a bit lately, it all serves as a reminder of how very much there is to learn about clear communication and about clarifying one&#39;s understanding of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my first few months of reading here, it was those same kind of defensive/confused remarks and disagreements that were actually helpful to observe. At the very least, I learned what was acceptable on this list. The occasional hurt/confused/push-back discussion can actually serve as a learning tool and another way to help clarify how all of this works. It is just when it happens over and over that it makes me want to gloss over those discussions (even though I know I may miss some golden nugget of wisdom in there somewhere.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"More peace, in this discussion","postDate":"1357612605","msgId":70238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQyMTA1NTEzLTdGOTUtNDA1Qi05NjM4LTZFODVCMEQ2MTk4N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70251,"prevInTime":70237,"nextInTime":70239,"topicId":70238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There have been a couple of instances lately where a new member posted too much too soon, and didn t like the response.
