The fear of elevators is because<br/>\nshe thinks she might get stuck in there, although this has never happened to<br/>\nus.  I get claustrophobic too, but I thought it was because my older<br/>\nbrothers used to hold pillows over my head. :-(  I have panicked inside dark<br/>\ntents.   Now I know I have to sleep with my head close to the entrance.  I<br/>\ndo have a little motion sickness too, but never when I&#39;m the driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a discussion with Lisa yesterday, asking her about her concerns and<br/>\nsharing some of your ideas.  She said if she must endure the 4 hour ride,<br/>\nshe would like to stay at Gramma&#39;s for a few days, rather than just one, as<br/>\nwe would if we went with Dh this weekend.  She also felt as if the trip was<br/>\nsprung on her suddenly.  She would prefer to have more advance time to &quot;get<br/>\nready&quot;.  She said peppermint helps, laying down helps, and she liked the<br/>\nidea of frequent stops.  She does prefer my car to any other.  We&#39;ve had it<br/>\nsince before she was born.  She said the &quot;new car smell&quot; of Dad&#39;s truck<br/>\n(1999) and Gramma&#39;s car (1995) makes her feel worse.  I&#39;ve thought about<br/>\nhaving a DVD player in the car too.  I wonder if looking at moving objects,<br/>\nlike a video screen, is better for some kids than looking at a book.  I can<br/>\nread in the car though without it bothering me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that there are other issues involved here for me.  I want to<br/>\nplease dh by accompnaying him on the weekend trip, and please my mom by<br/>\ncoming to visit her.  She does come to visit here too, but of course likes<br/>\nit when we visit her.  I have plenty of guilt issues going on with my mom.<br/>\nI&#39;m very good at guilt!  No matter how much time we spend with her, I hear<br/>\n&quot;nobody visits me&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m so sad you are leaving&quot;, rather than just<br/>\n&quot;thanks for coming, it was great to see you&quot;.  Well, that is another topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reminding me that what is important is helping my daughter feel<br/>\nsafe and as comfortable as possible.  We do have dreams of buying some kind<br/>\nof bus or motor home for taking road trips in real comfort...  She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to get sick on buses, but planes are awful for her.  She hasn&#39;t been on<br/>\na train.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12458,"nextTopicId":12337}}
