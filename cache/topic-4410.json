I<br/>\n&gt;can usually short circuit the stress and my bad behavior by identifiying<br/>\n&gt;exactly what the pressure is.  I am chronically, pathologically early--I<br/>\n&gt;hate to be late for anything.  This causes a lot of time-coercion in my<br/>\n&gt;life, as you can imagine.  (My husband is chronically late, but he just<br/>\n&gt;thinks it&#39;s because he&#39;s an optimist.  i.e., he thinks he can get more<br/>\n&gt;done than he actually can. :)  So when I feel the time crunch and start<br/>\n&gt;hurrying Will, I try to remind myself that it&#39;s OKAY to be on time.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Interestingly, when it comes to a project or job, I work better under<br/>\n&gt;deadline pressure, and often save the largest and most creative tasks<br/>\n&gt;for the last minute.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The money-coercion thing I handle best by planning ahead for everything,<br/>\n&gt;and using Quicken.  :)  I put money-to-blow right there in the budget<br/>\n&gt;(luckily we generally have some to blow).  It usually goes for the Big<br/>\n&gt;Kid meal on the way home from the skating rink, when Will is<br/>\n&gt;demonstrating the hungry-uglies because he should have eaten something<br/>\n&gt;besides cookies for breakfast, or stuff like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, if you can remember that it&#39;s not the kids, it&#39;s the time or money<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s making you stress out, you&#39;re one step closer to happy childhood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tuck<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2002 07:21:54 -0600<br/>\n&gt;   From: KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 210<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Thanks for letting us know, Sandra.

If I buy all the soap making stuff and say you decide how<br/>\n&gt;you want to use this, we usually will not have a finished product.  What is<br/>\n&gt;the best way to help them discover and yet minimize frustration? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You need to want to make soap yourself, or else they need to want to make<br/>\n&gt;soap themselves, because if you  just want them to make soap, there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;frustration all around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And if you say &quot;Do you want to help me make soap?&quot; they will probably say<br/>\n&gt;yes.  What they will mean is they want to do something new and fun.<br/>\n&gt;Whichever part of helping is NOT new and fun will go on the meter too, so<br/>\n&gt;they might not make it through the project if you involve them totally too<br/>\n&gt;soon (like when the stuff&#39;s still in the box).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So like a chef&#39;s helper or the tech-guy who sets up the TV demonstration in<br/>\n&gt;advance, have things at an organized and interesting place before you call<br/>\n&gt;them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If Holly wants to help me make cookies, I don&#39;t make her find the pans and<br/>\n&gt;see if there&#39;s vanilla.   She wants to stir, or to measure, to form dough, or<br/>\n&gt;to put them in the oven.  She doesn&#39;t have a two-hour attention span.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So settle for them being in on the fun parts, and don&#39;t unreasonably expect<br/>\n&gt;them to either do it all, or to even pay attention to it all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And if you make some with oatmeal and some without, you could either tell<br/>\n&gt;them &quot;some people like scratchy soap&quot; or not, and then let them decide on<br/>\n&gt;their own whether they themselves do or not later on, when the soap&#39;s cured,<br/>\n&gt;and they try it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Soap is a little like molding ceramics.  It&#39;s such a long-term project that<br/>\n&gt;younger kids have forgotten the beginning of it by the finished-project time.<br/>\n&gt;  So don&#39;t envision one solid experience, but the parts of it.  (Unless this<br/>\n&gt;is soap that&#39;s ready to use pretty soon and doesn&#39;t need to cure in stages.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But basically, if you don&#39;t want to do it yourself, don&#39;t even start.  If the<br/>\n&gt;kit costs money and you&#39;ll be resentful if the kids aren&#39;t thrilled and<br/>\n&gt;industrious, wait until later, if ever, to do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That sounds negative, but in the meantime there are half a million other<br/>\n&gt;things in the world that they might like better.  Instead of getting them to<br/>\n&gt;like what you think they will like, playing and goofing around and going for<br/>\n&gt;walks and discovering what they DO like will make a less frustrating path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 7 Feb 2002 08:49:15 EST<br/>\n&gt;   From: SandraDodd@...<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: animal behavior was chemistry sets<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 2/6/02 6:51:58 PM, homeschoolmd@... writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;  They have lots of books on animal intellegence and animal behavior in the<br/>\n&gt;library that I think Virginia will love.

Our solution was to sell our home ourselves.  It worked<br/>\n&gt;out really well since I got to make all the appointments and I knew when<br/>\n&gt;people were coming.  There was a company in VT (where we lived) that listed<br/>\n&gt;your home on their website, in their FSBO catalog and gave you all the<br/>\n&gt;paperwork.  It only cost about $300 for 3 months listing.  We sold our house<br/>\n&gt;for our asking price to the 7th viewers.  In all I showed the house 10 times<br/>\n&gt;in 20 days, but a couple times I had more than one showing in a day.  It was<br/>\n&gt;easier to be able to do my own scheduling.
