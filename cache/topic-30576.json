I think a lot of <br/>\nWaldorfy parents start looking into unschooling as their children age <br/>\nbecause it seems, to them, to be a logical progression. Several of the <br/>\nWaldorf websites mention unschooling very positively. But I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthey are prepared for what unschooling really is. I hope they weren&#39;t <br/>\ntoo turned off...hard to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yesterday as my principal-friend Gillian (yes, my best friend is a <br/>\nteacher/principal! &lt;G&gt;---LOTS of interesting dicussions there!) and I <br/>\nwere painting Duncan&#39;s room (he&#39;s getting a more grown up room), I <br/>\nmentioned the Waldorf parents at the conference. Gill had been offered <br/>\na job 30 years ago to work in a Steiner school in Germany. She chose <br/>\nnot to because of the four year training period. But she wasn&#39;t all <br/>\nthat *up* on the philosophy, so we talked a bit about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was wondering why/how the philosophy had progressed from the early <br/>\n1900s to now. What would Steiner had thought about where his movement <br/>\nhad gone? Would he have changed with the times? TV (BIG Waldorf no-no, <br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t even exist during Steiner&#39;s lifetime)? Legos? Video games <br/>\n(yeah---right! I doubt it!)? Computers? (SURELY!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that also got us taking about John Holt. We know that Holt became <br/>\nmore and more radical as he aged. And many unschoolers (me included) <br/>\nhave been accused of taking his philosophy &quot;too far.&quot; That he really <br/>\njust meant HOMEschooling. But I can&#39;t find anywhere in his writings <br/>\nwhere school at home was ever considered an option. I think he saw that <br/>\nas simply a stepping stone to real unschooling: some parents might need <br/>\nto do a little &quot;school-at-home&quot; to get their feet wet before they <br/>\ndiving into unschooling. You know---just a little paddling/treading <br/>\nbefore they took the plunge? I don&#39;t think he ever meant for parents to <br/>\nbring school home in any way or shape. I think he figured they would <br/>\nSEE that learning happened all the time, that children are natural <br/>\nlearners if they just took the children OUT of school and had them at <br/>\nhome a bit. The &quot;schoolwork&quot; would simply disappear after a while when <br/>\nthe parents figured it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt UNDERSTOOD that we are natural learners. ALL of us!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say for sure that he would have embraced video gaming, but I <br/>\nreally think he would *certainly* have seen its value just by observing <br/>\nchildren at play! He would have to have seen the huge connections being <br/>\nmade and joy in the faces of the children while they play and learn. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine his suggesting that they were harmful in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was incredibly progressive. Embracing new technologies would have <br/>\nbeen right up his alley to me! He had to have loved challenges and <br/>\nlearning anything new. Can&#39;t you see him at level 68 in WoW? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave &quot;we&quot; taken Holt too far? Possibly. But I think he was clearly <br/>\nmoving in a more radical direction in his last book, and I think he <br/>\nwould have had to have been appalled at the school-at-homers (doh!) <br/>\nthat are driving the learning right out of their children by being so <br/>\nmuch like school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see more discussion about Holt & Illich and how others <br/>\nthink their thinking would have progressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd not that it matters *here*---but Rudolf Steiner and Maria <br/>\nMontessori as well (I can do them on my own. &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.
