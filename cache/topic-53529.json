We are still recovering. Our kids went from living in a big Victorian home all with their own decorated rooms to a beat up trailer with the boys sharing one small room and my daughter&#39;s new room has enough space for a bed. We also lost our Suburban and now drive a beat up little $500 subaru. I only mention the *stuff* because it represents a lot of the sacrifice they have had to make but they are all so so so much happier we are together as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the separation did do a lot of damage.

You, and even he, may have come to terms with it, but it still happened and it still impacts your life and his.  I might help to see, instead of anger, deep concern.  I haven&#39;t seen any anger anywhere in this thread.  Divorce, even the best ones, if they involve a child, there is damage, there is loss.  To dismiss that because it happened 6 yrs ago may ignore all the wakes it created.  It&#39;s like an earth quake with after shocks.  Sometimes after shocks are as big as the actual earth quake and sometimes they are smaller.  You can&#39;t go back and stop the earth quake from happening and you can&#39;t stop the after shocks, but you can make your lives easier to live with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n***We connected better, but he still shunned most interactions with Craig.***<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of dads don&#39;t relate well to young children.  This is especially true if they aren&#39;t around a lot.  Dads need bonding a touch to stimulate the hormonal bonding process.  If a dad isn&#39;t able to do that, it doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t eventually get there.  It bothers me that you are still using that as an excuse or reason for the divorce, the lack of dad/son interactions.  Kids do pick up on that and are not likely to blame the dad as much as they blame themselves.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread  Radical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272567650","msgId":53616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyRkI4NTU5LUFFMEQtNDY0Ni05MzZCLTI3RTdBQUY5MkQ5REBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHAyeGZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI5MTA1MG85ZjFlYTc1ZmdmZWFmZDFhM2U0N2M1YzE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG0yZ2ZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI4MTMzNmc0ODI1YzJhM21mNWE1MDQ2Zjc4YThjMWFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MzI4QUFGNjYtREExMi00QTUyLTgxMzUtRDE2RUUyMDA2OTU5QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8cDJ4ZmQ4YjAxMjYxMDA0MjkxMDUwbzlmMWVhNzVmZ2ZlYWZkMWEzZTQ3YzVjMTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53615,"nextInTopic":53617,"prevInTime":53615,"nextInTime":53617,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You turned it into (him and me) and it was never about him, it was about you and your husband.  It could&#39;ve been about you and your husband and him.  Obviously you can&#39;t go back and undo that.  Kids are never ok with divorce.  Sometimes they overcome it and move on because it&#39;s human nature to adapt to ones environment.  You&#39;ve helped your son adapt and that&#39;s a good thing.  It might be good to know that it was still about you, you could have helped him adapt in an environment that included his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The reason I KNOW is because since removing corn syrup (which was now 5<br/>\nyears ago) the behavior has happened only once***<br/>\n<br/>\n***So the fact that I suspected food was not because I was being dismissive of his<br/>\nfeelings, but because the behavior wasn&#39;t new entirely. The reason I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nseen it as often is because we didn&#39;t have soda around much when I was<br/>\nliving with my ex. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at the age of 11, a normally unsteady and sometimes tumultuous time in a kid&#39;s life, he went through the loss of a parent, moving, acceptance of a new partner of moms, dietary change, new parenting philosophy, new friends, loss of old ones, and you still think it&#39;s all about the corn syrup.  I don&#39;t doubt that some people are sensitive to corn syrup.  I&#39;ve seen it.  I know what that looks like.  I think you are lucky, and it could be partly because you are unschooling, that your son didn&#39;t drown in the deep end.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can tell you that he&#39;s been a happier child since the divorce - in<br/>\nlarge part because he now has a dad who is present in his life.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile your new husband and your son&#39;s step dad may be a great guy, he will never replace your son&#39;s dad.   Even if your son and his step dad grow a great bond between them, at some point in your son&#39;s life he&#39;ll seek out his father.  I&#39;ve seen this happen many times in many different families, in many different ways.  To say that your son has been happier since the divorce, is more about your own self soothing.  You won&#39;t ever know.  Once a person has gone down a path, one that they can&#39;t go back on, they have no way of knowing which way may have been better, or happier making.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** This was<br/>\nhappening more often, but not all the time, not even regularly, and that&#39;s<br/>\neventually what led me to suspect food. I&#39;m not the only parent that has<br/>\nnoticed a cause/effect relationship between corn syrup and their child&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior - it&#39;s due to the way it&#39;s processed, not due to the fact that it&#39;s<br/>\na sweetener.***<br/>\n<br/>\n***To people who have no food issues, those of us who&#39;ve<br/>\nfound relief - both adults and children - utilizing the Feingold program<br/>\nseem like nutcases***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the Feingold website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Numerous studies show that certain synthetic food additives can have serious learning, behavior, and/or health effects for sensitive people.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes a person sensitive?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always so simple to just blame food.  Food can cause negative reactions in some people, it does cause reactions for everyone.  Our bodies use the ingredients in varying ways.  It&#39;s all part of our biochemical processes.  How people react to their environment and stress is also a biochemical process.  What comes first, the chicken or the egg?  That&#39;s the sort of argument this is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get really sick when I eat beef or pork.  When I was a kid, I used to choke those meats down against my will.  Many times, I used honey to do so.  I can&#39;t eat honey anymore.  My naturopath had posed the idea that it might be guilty by association.  What a person reacts to in their diet could very much be a part of their environment as a whole.  I don&#39;t discount the fact that there are foods and other things that do cause allergic reactions in people.  People who are allergic to cats, generally can&#39;t be around cats without sneezing and getting watery eyes.  I&#39;ve also heard that there are ways to bathe cats to make their fur less allergenic.  It involved vinegar or something... anyone who actually wants to do that, has GOT to really love cats, because boy oh boy, have you ever tried to bathe one?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps corn syrup is like honey.  It&#39;s guilty by association.  It seems far better to not make such a big deal about the corn syrup and let your son avoid foods he doesn&#39;t like and eat what he does like, corn syrup or not.  It could be a choice.  A small choice.  This kid had one of the biggest things in his life taken away from him, it wasn&#39;t his choice and he was powerless to do anything about it.  Corn syrup, he has power over, why make it something else that he&#39;s powerless about?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread  Radical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272565623","msgId":53609,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2ODU3Q0E0LUFBRDItNDc3NC1CRjRBLUY3MjY2NEJFOTI4Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHAyeGZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI5MTA1MG85ZjFlYTc1ZmdmZWFmZDFhM2U0N2M1YzE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG0yZ2ZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI4MTMzNmc0ODI1YzJhM21mNWE1MDQ2Zjc4YThjMWFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MzI4QUFGNjYtREExMi00QTUyLTgxMzUtRDE2RUUyMDA2OTU5QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8cDJ4ZmQ4YjAxMjYxMDA0MjkxMDUwbzlmMWVhNzVmZ2ZlYWZkMWEzZTQ3YzVjMTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53607,"nextInTopic":53615,"prevInTime":53607,"nextInTime":53610,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=It s all water under the bridge now, and I regret that my post caused such a furor on the list.

The<br/>\n&gt; amount of time he was gone (4 years worth of time gone out of the 5-1/2<br/>\n&gt; years on the one ship) meant there was not much time to work on our<br/>\n&gt; marriage.

My husband has been away from his family more than he&#39;s been with us since he joined the Marines 8 years ago. Every time he leaves, especially when it&#39;s for a long deployment, he comes back a little more disconnected from the rest of us. He&#39;s been away for a long time. The kids have grown more than he could&#39;ve imagined. They are different people from when he left. He&#39;s only had to think of himself and his job for months and months, living like a bachelor for all intents and purposes. It takes a long time to readjust to family life after that. When he&#39;s barely home as long as he&#39;s been gone before leaving again, none of us have the time needed to fully assimilate him back into the family life. We struggle with this all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gone through times when I thought my husband didn&#39;t care. He had no interest in working on making our marriage and our family life better. He was oblivious to what anyone else thought or felt. I&#39;ve been angry and hurt. I&#39;ve been self-righteous. I&#39;ve felt unloved and completely alone. I&#39;ve thought we had no passion, no romance. I had no romantic feelings toward him at all, thinking we were just friends, if even that. Every time he&#39;d leave and come home, I&#39;d feel like we were starting all over again. The man I was married to, who was going to come back into my home to live and sleep in my bed, was a stranger. I had to work at feeling connected to him again if that was what I wanted. I couldn&#39;t just sit back and wait for him to do what I wanted. How would he know? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting twist on that is that during the post-deployment debriefings, the Marines are told not to come home and just push right in and start taking things over. They are told to come home almost like outside observers for a while until they get a feel for how things are and can step back into their roles without stepping on someone else&#39;s toes. People definitely change over those times. That can certainly account for much of the seemingly disconnectedness and aloofness. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I cannot even begin to understand the things he saw and did when he was away. I can&#39;t understand how those things have affected him. He doesn&#39;t tell me about them because he doesn&#39;t want that stuff to touch us. I respect that. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to know. That means he has a lot of things inside himself that he has to wrestle with. He needs a lot of down time. Maybe he&#39;s even afraid to get too close to us again because he knows he&#39;ll just have to leave us again and he remembers how painful it was the first time. It&#39;s easier to stay disconnected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what my point with that is. I guess that, like others have said, it&#39;s up to each person to make a commitment to the marriage and do what they need to do to make things work regardless of what the other person does (except in cases of abuse, of course). I&#39;ve not been through a divorce with children but I have been a single mother. I don&#39;t ever want to go back to that. I am a single mother in a lot of ways now with my husband gone so much but I&#39;ve got it better than I did, I think, because on top of everything else I don&#39;t have to also work outside the home. My husband gives us everything he earns and I am so grateful for that. He has given me the ability to be home with my children so that we can unschool. I know that he loves us and is committed to us even if he doesn&#39;t always show it the way I want him to just by that action alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;d have to worry about not being able to unschool if we got a divorce. I&#39;m not naive enough to think my husband would never object to it but I think I know where things stand enough to know he probably wouldn&#39;t fight unschooling unless there were some obvious problems with the kids. There are other reasons that I think it&#39;s important for us to stay married and I&#39;m not going to jeopardize those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread  Radical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272543275","msgId":53596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMkZEMzc0LUE1ODYtNDhBNi1CNDQ5LUYxMzUyQzNDRUNDN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgyamZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI4MjAxN3FjNmQ0NGU0MnQ5NTYzZTFkYzQ5ZWU4YmEyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG0yZ2ZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI4MTMzNmc0ODI1YzJhM21mNWE1MDQ2Zjc4YThjMWFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8OTFEMzkyODQtNUU5RS00NTNELUI4QjYtNDA1NUM2NTI2Qzg0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8M0Y2NzA3ODMtOTFEMy00MzI0LUE4QjMtMUJFRjFDQjRFQTI3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8aDJqZmQ4YjAxMjYxMDA0MjgyMDE3cWM2ZDQ0ZTQydDk1NjNlMWRjNDllZThiYTJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53593,"nextInTopic":53603,"prevInTime":53595,"nextInTime":53597,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My son was okay with this a long time ago.

I just got a copy but haven&#39;t read  <br/>\nit yet.  My friend Lori Odhner has and she does marriage counselling.  <br/>\nIt changed her views, and when she got a copy of The Big Book of  <br/>\nUnschooling (I sent her one because she was one of those first La  <br/>\nLeche League leaders in my life and I had named her) she got excited  <br/>\nand asked me to come and speak at a marriage conference.  The funding  <br/>\nfor that has fallen through so there might not be one next year, but  <br/>\nshe lives in a smallish town in a limited college community and is  <br/>\nhaving a hard time saying those things to people she knows so well so  <br/>\nshe wanted someone from outside the community.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t want to talk or think about it.  And in the case of the  <br/>\nboy mentioned above, it can&#39;t be changed now, but for any family not  <br/>\ndivorced who considers it sometimes,  it&#39;s worth knowing some of the  <br/>\ndownsides.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to shame people who are divorced, but I don&#39;t want this  <br/>\nlist to be a divorce support or divorce encouragement group, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I read the post to which I&#39;m responding, I had written this on  <br/>\nanother list:<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\nI had a long exchange with someone I know only on facebook and<br/>\nonline. She asked if I had heard from another such friend. I hadn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an appeal for help I couldn&#39;t give. This has happened before,<br/>\nand it&#39;s sad, and it will happen again, but I thought discussing it<br/>\nhere might help a little bit with future prevention.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivorce proceedings were so far advanced that the father was asking<br/>\nfor full custody because of unschooling. I was asked to provide some<br/>\nsort of proof or defense. There isn&#39;t one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no defense. There is no guarantee or right or freedom that<br/>\nlets someone bypass the judicial system. Unschooling doesn&#39;t outrank<br/>\nlaws or social expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time that I can help is before the divorce, before the unschooling<br/>\neven, and that&#39;s reminding people that marriage is more important than<br/>\nunschooling. If that sounds stupid, maybe think of it as a peaceful<br/>\nmarriage with unschooling as an agreed-upon element being the most<br/>\nstable unschooling situation I have ever seen or can imagine. (Well<br/>\npeople do imagine perfect other situations, but they&#39;re in the rare-to-<br/>\nimaginary category.)<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples I&#39;ve used before have been that deciding to unschool is like<br/>\nbuying a yacht. It&#39;s a big deal and both partners need to agree on it<br/>\nor it could cause a divorce. Switching to unschooling is like<br/>\nswitching to an unusual religion. The only way a family can change<br/>\nreligions is for the family (not just one parent) to convert.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case in which unschooling is the cause of a divorce, those<br/>\nchildren have been done a great disservice at best, and could<br/>\npotentially be separated from any possibility of unschooling, and<br/>\nseparated from their mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the unschooling sites and books ever written or ever to come can<br/>\nchange that. Pretty words can&#39;t change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just marriages, but that would be another topic.

She invested everything, put the idea of divorce or separation as far out from the possible as what she could do. And it wasn&#39;t happy, her marriage, it wasn&#39;t good. But she wanted to know that she had made every effort. She didn&#39;t worry about his share, about what he needed to do to make it work, it was all about what she could do. She did everything she could to clear the slate of all the bitterness she may have felt, to breathe only fresh air into the marriage and not the stale, angry stuff that she&#39;d been coughing up in the days that led up to her decision.  My memory, &#39;cause I can&#39;t find the post anymore, is that the more she invested, the more he invested back. The more her husband saw of her being generous and kind the less he felt needy and desperate to get his share. By putting up and shutting up she upped the value of the marriage to them<br/>\n both and they both began to invest more and more and more. And they stumbled, but the more they had behind them of caring and kindness and generosity, the more quickly they recovered from the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that it works in my own life. The more I give, the more I enjoy giving, the more what comes back wraps me up and makes me smile. I can give a lot with a martyred air, but if I stop acting the role of the long suffering, and start embracing the joy of my life, well, it becomes a gift to give. And when I hear the voice of discontent, the voice of &quot;all that I do&quot; beginning in my brain, I do everything I can to dance out the voices that are about how good I got it, &#39;cause I got it real good. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to justify your decisions to this list. Your actions, your decisions are not something anyone here can make you accountable for. We are just a bunch of folks who&#39;ve come together to try and figure out the best ways to unschool happily and better. One of the biggest ways of doing that is to make the partnership that your children live in and with a good and strong partnership. It is the lucky and the few who manage to move from one marriage through divorce and continue to unschool the children from that marriage. And it is even luckier children who come through a divorce unscathed; I was relatively ambivelant when my parents got divorced, but more and more I&#39;ve grown to regret their decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a fairly quiet, at the moment, list (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingpartnerships/)\">http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingpartnerships/)</a> that is about looking for ways to make a partnership sing with unschooling as the framework. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193310064,"authorName":"JoyErin","from":"&quot;JoyErin&quot; &lt;joyerin@...&gt;","profile":"werefree2learn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread Radical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272526218","msgId":53590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBNTU0QjFDNzgwODQ4RTA5RTVGMDVCNzZFODM2MUQyQERhZFBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG0yeDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI4MTk1OHo5YzllNmEyOXcxZmRjNjAyZjQxNzMwYWY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG0yZ2ZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI4MTMzNmc0ODI1YzJhM21mNWE1MDQ2Zjc4YThjMWFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8OTFEMzkyODQtNUU5RS00NTNELUI4QjYtNDA1NUM2NTI2Qzg0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8M0Y2NzA3ODMtOTFEMy00MzI0LUE4QjMtMUJFRjFDQjRFQTI3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bTJ4M2E5M2ZmZjExMDA0MjgxOTU4ejljOWU2YTI5dzFmZGM2MDJmNDE3MzBhZjVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53586,"nextInTopic":53591,"prevInTime":53589,"nextInTime":53591,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= This means that they will be GLAD to accept or have someone name culprits other than the parents.

Hopefully you can find a<br/>\nway to not repeat the same mistakes.*~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they can be, but my ex was not the sort to work through problems in<br/>\nfront of other people. When I asked him about seeking help, a way to work<br/>\nthrough all of this, his answer was no. He would not do it, and nothing I<br/>\nsaid could get him to go. I tried at different times during our 15 yr<br/>\nmarriage. One person can not make a marriage work, no matter how hard they<br/>\ntry. I gave all I could, and when I realized what my husband&#39;s attitude was<br/>\ndoing to my son, that&#39;s when we left. Yes, all of those things can be worked<br/>\nthrough, but how does one work through having a spouse who wants little to<br/>\nnothing to do with their child? One who pushes away the child, and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsee the look of hurt on his face. I did not enter into this decision<br/>\nlightly, and was fully aware of the fact that I was making a decision that<br/>\nwould impact my son greatly. But as parents, we have to weigh matters<br/>\nheavily when it comes to the best way to help our children grow up happy,<br/>\nhealthy, and as little damaged as possible. Is that not why we&#39;ve chosen to<br/>\nunschool?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~*Something that inspires me, is hearing long time married couples talk<br/>\nabout their relationship. Many of them lived through all of the<br/>\nthings you mentioned, yet stayed together. It&#39;s ok to admit that you<br/>\nwere selfish and made a mistake that cost a lot of peace for your<br/>\nchild, whether or not you can see it or agree with it. What&#39;s done is<br/>\ndone, but you could probably help your son by owning it and<br/>\napologizing for it.*~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was okay with this a long time ago. The divorce was 6 years ago. We<br/>\nsat down and talked about the divorce and what it meant for the two of us<br/>\n(him and me), several times in the first year. Whenever he had a question or<br/>\na concern he came to me, or to his eventual stepdad, whomever he needed to<br/>\naddress the issue with, and we sat and listened and answered his concerns as<br/>\nfully, and seriously, as we could.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~*I very strongly believe that erratic behavior is caused by<br/>\nenvironment. Divorce is way bigger than corn syrup, in environmental<br/>\nchanges. To say that the divorce was amicable and easy for the<br/>\nparents and therefore makes it somehow easy for the kids too, is<br/>\ncompletely blinding yourself. It&#39;s better than a yucky divorce for<br/>\nsure. Having a good step parent is better than having a yucky, and<br/>\nthat&#39;s great. None of those things make divorce any less painful for<br/>\na kid. Men change, dads change, moms change, women change; you didn&#39;t<br/>\naccount for that and your child paid the cost of your short sightedness. *~~<br/>\nYes, divorce is way bigger than corn syrup. I looked back, just to make sure<br/>\nand I never said, or implied, that the divorce was easy on Craig. We did<br/>\nwhat we could to make as painless as possible, but I know it wasn&#39;t pain<br/>\nfree. I can tell you that he&#39;s been a happier child since the divorce - in<br/>\nlarge part because he now has a dad who is present in his life. My ex wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthere, physically much of the time (he had much sea duty so he was gone a<br/>\ntremendous amount of time, and his shore duty was spent with many odd hour<br/>\nshifts), and when he was actually home, emotionally he wasn&#39;t there. Yes,<br/>\npeople change, and my ex did change in ways that I didn&#39;t expect, but one<br/>\nthing that never really changed (and that I&#39;d always hoped would) was his<br/>\nbehavior towards his son.<br/>\n~~*How in the world can you KNOW that it wasn&#39;t the divorce that caused<br/>\nthe erratic behavior? That, again, seems very short sighted. To<br/>\nblame it on food just seems mean to me and completely dismissive of<br/>\nyour child&#39;s very real feelings that were exhibited in erratic behavior.*~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I KNOW is because since removing corn syrup (which was now 5<br/>\nyears ago) the behavior has happened only once, as I said in my addendum -<br/>\nwhen he&#39;d had ice cream made with a corn syrup base. It also happened while<br/>\nwe were living in Washington (when he was between ages 2-1/2 and 8-1/2) and<br/>\nwhile we were living in California (between ages 8-1/2 and almost 11). So<br/>\nthe fact that I suspected food was not because I was being dismissive of his<br/>\nfeelings, but because the behavior wasn&#39;t new entirely. The reason I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nseen it as often is because we didn&#39;t have soda around much when I was<br/>\nliving with my ex. He preferred iced tea or sports drinks, and I don&#39;t drink<br/>\nsoda... so I didn&#39;t have as many opportunities to observe the behavior. When<br/>\nI did see it before (and before we&#39;d researched alternatives treatments to<br/>\nADHD), I thought he was just having a bad day, or that it was because of who<br/>\nhe&#39;d been hanging around with, and dealt with it as I could. This was<br/>\nhappening more often, but not all the time, not even regularly, and that&#39;s<br/>\neventually what led me to suspect food. I&#39;m not the only parent that has<br/>\nnoticed a cause/effect relationship between corn syrup and their child&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior - it&#39;s due to the way it&#39;s processed, not due to the fact that it&#39;s<br/>\na sweetener.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably sounds extreme, maybe even crazy or cruel, to someone who&#39;s not<br/>\nliving it; to remove a food, or to suspect it in behavior issues.<br/>\nUnschooling sounds extreme, even crazy or cruel (to the point that there are<br/>\nthose saying that unschoolers should be investigated for child abuse) to<br/>\nsomeone not living it. To people who have no food issues, those of us who&#39;ve<br/>\nfound relief - both adults and children - utilizing the Feingold program<br/>\nseem like nutcases (I&#39;ve gotten that look from people). Unschoolers<br/>\n(especially radical unschoolers) seem the same way to those who have never<br/>\nresearched it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura W<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread \tRadical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272509901","msgId":53586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG0yeDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI4MTk1OHo5YzllNmEyOXcxZmRjNjAyZjQxNzMwYWY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNGNjcwNzgzLTkxRDMtNDMyNC1BOEIzLTFCRUYxQ0I0RUEyN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxtMmdmZDhiMDEyNjEwMDQyODEzMzZnNDgyNWMyYTNtZjVhNTA0NmY3OGE4YzFhZkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDw5MUQzOTI4NC01RTlFLTQ1M0QtQjhCNi00MDU1QzY1MjZDODRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CSA8M0Y2NzA3ODMtOTFEMy00MzI0LUE4QjMtMUJFRjFDQjRFQTI3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53585,"nextInTopic":53590,"prevInTime":53585,"nextInTime":53587,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the erratic behavior?

What is wrong with<br/>\nbeing friends with someone you chose to have children with? The whole<br/>\npassion thing can come and go in a long term relationship. It&#39;s very short<br/>\nsighted to leave a marriage for that reason.*~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first husband and I were having issues by the second year of our<br/>\nmarriage, tension and arguments about money were a pretty common aspect of<br/>\nour marriage prior to his enlistment in the military (which eased some of<br/>\nthe tensions and some of the arguments about money, but not all). We&#39;d been<br/>\nmarried almost 5 yrs and Craig was 8 mos old when my husband enlisted. The<br/>\namount of time he was gone (4 years worth of time gone out of the 5-1/2<br/>\nyears on the one ship) meant there was not much time to work on our<br/>\nmarriage. A one-night stand he had while deployed - and I did not find out<br/>\nabout until just before we moved back to California - also weakened what<br/>\nthere was of our marriage. By the time I sought divorce, we&#39;d been married<br/>\nalmost 15 years and he&#39;d been in the Navy for 10 years, and our relationship<br/>\nwas more like roommates than spouses - we led separate lives. He came home<br/>\nafter being gone for a week, sat in his chair and watched the golf channel<br/>\nall day Friday, went golfing early in the morning on Saturday, had little to<br/>\ndo with his son or me... and expressed no real emotion for either of us, and<br/>\nvery rarely even said a whole lot to either of us. He and Craig share an<br/>\ninterest in golf. He took him once, expressed what a good player Craig was,<br/>\nand never took him again, though he went every Saturday. He had no tolerance<br/>\nfor Craig having any friends over when he was home - and since most of<br/>\nCraig&#39;s friends in the neighborhood were schooled, weekends were the time<br/>\nthey had available for playing. That is not the normal up and down of a<br/>\nmarriage or any loving relationship. I didn&#39;t expect constant lover-like<br/>\nbehavior. What I hoped for was a loving companionship - not a nearly silent<br/>\nroommate, who had little to do with me, and even less to do with his son.<br/>\nWhen I told him that I thought we should get a divorce, his very first<br/>\nresponse was &quot;What will you do for money?&quot; When I told him what I&#39;d thought<br/>\nabout for that, he agreed, and it was done. We set out an arrangement for<br/>\neverything (including custody and child support) and had it notarized, and<br/>\nfiled non-contested. That was it. There was nothing left of this marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling aspect that Sandra mentioned ~~*quote: unschooling when dad<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea :unquote*~~ was a non-issue by the time of<br/>\nthe divorce. His dad had problems with it at first, because it was<br/>\nunfamiliar and way outside of his comfort zone. After we&#39;d been unschooling<br/>\nfor a year, his discomfort lessened, and by a couple years in he was fine<br/>\nwith it. Unschooling was not an issue in our lives and neither the cause of<br/>\nthe divorce, nor of Craig&#39;s erratic behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the erractic behavior I was referring to, it was really erractic. It<br/>\nwas something I&#39;d seen in California before the divorce was even a<br/>\npossibility, but not often. Something I&#39;d noticed in Washington, but not<br/>\noften. We didn&#39;t see it often in Colorado either, and it was odd. The worst<br/>\none happened in California, but the one that really made us think after we&#39;d<br/>\nmoved to Colorado was almost as bad. It goes like this: Craig goes out to<br/>\nplay, comes in and gets a snack and something to drink, and then goes<br/>\nback out to play. Most of the time, life goes on as normal. On those rare<br/>\ndays, as I let him know it was going to be time to come in soon - for<br/>\nwhatever reason, an out-of-the-blue meltdown happens. First he argues, flat<br/>\nout angry yelling on his part, then he becomes indecisive, doesn&#39;t know if<br/>\nhe wants to come in, stay out, eat dinner, not eat dinner, play a video<br/>\ngame, watch tv, build legos (mind most of this is coming from him - I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had much time to say anything), and then fully dissolved in tears<br/>\nhe&#39;s on the floor sobbing as though his world has ended. At that point, I<br/>\ncould comfort him - prior to that I&#39;d have been pushed away forcefully. All<br/>\nof that happens in less than ten minutes. In Colorado that meltdown happened<br/>\nmore often, but still not with any predictability. We&#39;d already modified his<br/>\ndiet to help control his ADHD (www.feingold.org for more information),<br/>\nremoving all artificials (color, flavor, sweetener, preservative). I&#39;d<br/>\nremember reading about similar reactions on the Feingold members board, and<br/>\nchecked his diet diary that I was keeping since we were testing a food the<br/>\nweek of the worst meltdown in Colorado (he was laying on the floor crying<br/>\nthat he was too hungry to eat, but turning down all foods). We started<br/>\nlooking at ingredients of things he&#39;d had and realized that he&#39;d had a<br/>\ncouple of things with corn syrup in them. It made us wonder, but we weren&#39;t<br/>\nentirely certain. Later that week he had a soda, and the reaction happened<br/>\nwithin a half an hour. So we decided to take corn syrup out of his diet for<br/>\na few weeks (it meant looking close at everything, because it&#39;s in strange<br/>\nfoods - like Wheat Thins for instance), and then test the corn syrup foods.<br/>\nUpon having a fruit cup (the liquid in the cup was corn syrup) and then a<br/>\nlittle bit later, a soda (and these were things that were usually around the<br/>\nhouse, and that he was normally allowed to have), we got a similar reaction<br/>\nto what had prompted this test before. Because he&#39;d had these reactions<br/>\nbefore corn syrup was ever suspected, and before I&#39;d changed his diet even,<br/>\nwe knew we had found the cause. Since we have removed corn syrup completely,<br/>\nwe&#39;ve only seen this reaction once - that was when he went with a friend and<br/>\nhad ice cream at a place that made their own, we didn&#39;t realize they used<br/>\ncorn syrup in their ice cream base. He got over that reaction, told both me<br/>\nand his step-dad that he hated the way that it had made him feel (out of<br/>\ncontrol) and has since been very good about reading labels or asking<br/>\nquestions to make sure that corn syrup (or dextrose) is not listed in the<br/>\ningredients.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Craig and his step-dad, they actually have a relationship, they talk,<br/>\nthey go places together, they have shared interests and spend time together<br/>\ndoing them, affection is expressed between them (as opposed to Craig&#39;s dad<br/>\nwho very often would push him away if Craig asked for a hug). Craig is able<br/>\nto ask a question and get an answer instead of getting brushed off or<br/>\nignored. Is their relationship perfect? No, but it&#39;s definitely better than<br/>\nwhat he had before. Was I selfish for getting divorced - possibly, and<br/>\nbelieve me I thought about it for months before I said something. What it<br/>\ncame down to was this: What is better in this case - staying with a man who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really care for his son, and rejects all affection from his son, or<br/>\nleaving and starting a new life where Craig wouldn&#39;t have his loved<br/>\nrebuffed? I chose the latter, and it worked for us. Had there been a<br/>\nrelationship of love and caring between Craig and his dad, circumstances<br/>\nmight have been different. His relationship with his dad is better now -<br/>\nmore like an uncle and nephew - but not anything like what he and my current<br/>\nhusband have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sussing out culprits (brought from the thread Radical Unschooling Question)","postDate":"1272476500","msgId":53543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxNzg1NC4zMzU2OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFDN0IwNTg5LTZCRTUtNDZBQy1CRkU0LTAxMzU4ODNDOTA5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53538,"nextInTopic":53575,"prevInTime":53542,"nextInTime":53544,"topicId":53529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Moving a child around, unschooling when dad doesn t think it s a good idea, and getting a new boyfriend (no matter HOW cool-to-perfect the new boyfriend is)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-299679285\">***Moving a child around, unschooling when dad doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a good <br/>\nidea, and getting a new boyfriend (no matter HOW cool-to-perfect the <br/>\nnew boyfriend is) would mess up Jesus.

She says he&#39;s gossipy and needy for attention, to the extreme.  He confided in me once about his parent&#39;s divorce.  He was 11.  He still hasn&#39;t gotten over it, he&#39;s almost 15.  He&#39;s been to counseling, acted out, beyond normal preteen hormonal weirdness.  He resorts to drugs and manipulative friendships.  His mom is really really nice.  She tries as best as she can.  She&#39;s at least aware enough to KNOW that it was the divorce that did it, that changed her son&#39;s behavior during a crucial time in his life.  That&#39;s the age that kids need more of their parents and more security and more of everything.

If it becomes not a crime, then there are factors  <br/>\nwithout the finger of guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving a child around, unschooling when dad doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a good  <br/>\nidea, and getting a new boyfriend (no matter HOW cool-to-perfect the  <br/>\nnew boyfriend is) would mess up Jesus.  Though it makes parents feel  <br/>\nbetter to look at their own decisions in the best possible light,  <br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s important to look at it from the child&#39;s point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child who&#39;s just gone through a divorce needs lots more parental  <br/>\nfocus and attention for a while to feel secure, but very often that&#39;s  <br/>\nwhen the parents go into a depression or a new relationship, both of  <br/>\nwhich leave the child on his own more than he needs during his own  <br/>\npainful transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back over life and all the divorces I heard of from whatever  <br/>\nangle, kids are assured it&#39;s not their fault.  But I think that phrase  <br/>\nis partly intended to convey &quot;and it&#39;s not going to affect you for  <br/>\nlong, and it&#39;s none of your business.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53415,"nextTopicId":53608}}
