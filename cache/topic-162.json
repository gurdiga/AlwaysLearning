It is different but no less amazingly wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is excitement, thrill, sense of completion, sense of &quot;rightness&quot; or of <br/>\nbeing &quot;in tune&quot; (there&#39;s that music analogy again) with the universe -- it is <br/>\nthe &quot;brain&quot; having an AHA moment, not the heart. It is a little or big burst <br/>\nof understanding about how things work in our world and having either a <br/>\nflashing moment or a slow dawning of understanding about how the universe <br/>\nworks in patterns that repeat and make sense at many many different levels. <br/>\nThis is the level at which it feels spiritual to me. It is that level of <br/>\n&quot;connectedness&quot; and patterns and things working in a way that makes some kind <br/>\nof ultimate sense and that it is something we can strive to understand while <br/>\nknowing we can never fully understand. This is somehow related (and I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nthat I can&#39;t express this more articulately) to my own belief that our <br/>\npurpose in this life is to strive to know God - who is unknowable (and who is <br/>\nnot limited to the simple anthropomorphic concept of a deity that most <br/>\nreligions teach). So - striving to comprehend something that uncovers or <br/>\nopens my eyes to patterns in the universe seems part of that spiritual <br/>\npurpose.  But - so is EVERYTHING else that involves learning; all things that <br/>\ngive us glimpses into human nature or into the nature of the universe.

We do have many of these things (and in<br/>\nthe Connections line, have another book called The Pinball Effect, shelved with history).  I&#39;m<br/>\naware, as is my math squirrel, of the dangers lurking in frightening math books, but I&#39;m willing<br/>\nto take a chance.  Our library has wild and broadly overlapping sections on history, geography,<br/>\nreligion, education, science, cooking, philosophy, literature, biography, and a bunch of other<br/>\n&quot;topics&quot;.  In spite of the overlaps, it helps us to locate things.In the section we could call<br/>\nmath are only a couple of  &quot;fun with math&quot; type things that I bought when I was supply teaching,<br/>\nand a textbook or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the math in this and that; I even see that it IS a full infusion of the whole<br/>\nuniverse, but are there any writers who are able to let me in on their sense of wonder, on their<br/>\nAHA&#39;s and on what grips them in mathematics?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try it this way,--I am touched emotionally, sometimes moved to tears by music, poetry,<br/>\nprose, paintings, photographs, films, dance, plays and people&#39;s actions.  I&#39;ve not yet been<br/>\ntouched by anything that I recognize as mathematical, but I believe it to be possible.  Are<br/>\nthere people who experience the world through mathematics and can communicate the passionate,<br/>\nthe beautiful or the emotional part of it?  My husband suggests that math doesn&#39;t work this way,<br/>\nprecisely.  He suggests that music and architecture ARE  mathematical expressions of the beauty<br/>\nand wonder of the universe, that it is, in itself, divorced from emotion and all that (I may not<br/>\nhave that last part quite right).<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy, you wrote<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure what to recommend.  I find a lot of it fascinating but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; also a mathematician!  I learned early in my life that I thought differently<br/>\n&gt; about math than those around me - I liked it!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to have a window on your experience of math.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You could start with the history of mathematics - how it got started, how<br/>\n&gt; it developed, etc.  Check out Marvin Gardner&#39;s books - he writes (or wrote)<br/>\n&gt; a column in Scientific American about mathematical games.  In fact any<br/>\n&gt; mathematical game book might be a good starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The development from philosphy I know and have read a little about.  I&#39;ll do some more and I&#39;ll<br/>\ncheck out Marvin Gardner.  Mathematical games and game theory stuff may not be a way in for me<br/>\n(math squirrel is scratching away), but perhaps for the others living here.  I&#39;ll try this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also what interests do you and your family have?  Carpentry and quilting<br/>\n&gt; both involve geometry for example!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interests?  We all enjoy reading and going to second hand bookstores or library book sales.  Les<br/>\nis an actor, as was I before getting the papers to teach drama and English, so interpretting<br/>\nwritten language and making it come alive are  kind of an all-encompassing way of life around<br/>\nhere.  But this is not exactly an interest, more something we try to keep under control.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, trying to figure out why people do what they do and trying to understand the world from<br/>\ndifferent people&#39;s perspectives (hence this current curiousity about making a little excursion<br/>\ninto mathematicians&#39; minds). I do what comes along and am interested in most of it for a time.<br/>\nBasic carpentry if there&#39;s something that needs to be built, or electricity if something  it<br/>\nneeds rewiring, knitting a pair of socks, or sewing something, but these are not really<br/>\ninterests. When not working, Les reads mostly history, philosphy and literature (bridge and<br/>\nchess books to relax when working on a show). They do airplane models together and talk about<br/>\nthe history of aviation, both in itself and as it relates to various wars and such. Ned is<br/>\ninterested in streetcars, airships, computer games, urban planning, transportation in general,<br/>\nmodel trains, board games.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlenty of math here, I think, but tool math, not gorgeous math or inspirational math  or math as<br/>\nthe key to the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s thoughts made some connections for me, too.  I&#39;m going back to mulling this over, and<br/>\nwatching where this thread goes, but if anyone thinks of any books that might help me to flip<br/>\nthe switch, let me know.
