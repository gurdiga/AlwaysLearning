Lori","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-699721478\">I had side mail and responded, and mentioned Lori Odhner as a possible  <br/>\nresource, and looked Lori up to make sure she was findable, and we  <br/>\ncommunicated.  Lori (who with Carol Rice was one of the two La Leche  <br/>\nLeague leaders who so profoundly changed my life when Kirby was a  <br/>\nbaby) said she loved reading &quot;Public School on your own Terms,&quot; an  <br/>\narticle I had sent in the e-mail response to the other mom.   So I  <br/>\nwent to read it to see what Lori would&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have changed in twelve years.  Most people have, probably, so that&#39;s  <br/>\nnot a big deal, but because this article is really out there in many  <br/>\nplaces (in Linda Dobson&#39;s book, and so in Japanese, and various other  <br/>\nplaces), I wanted to bring one little passage here and say something  <br/>\nfor the record.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-In families in which student-directed learning is the primary  <br/>\nfocus, children taking control of their own learning by deciding  <br/>\nwhether to pursue it at home or at school can be liberating for all  <br/>\ninvolved, and educational in the extreme for their teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Although the ideal might be children who have never gone to school  <br/>\na day in their lives, reality isn�t always ideal.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was writing for a newsletter in California which was not &quot;a radical  <br/>\nunschooling newsletter&quot; (not that anything was, twelve years ago), but  <br/>\nwas a politically-leaning &quot;reject government schools&quot; newsletter.  I  <br/>\nlost my gig as an invited, featured columnist over this article.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer use terms like &#39;Student directed learning,&quot; or &quot;taking  <br/>\ncontrol of their own learning.&quot;  I quit thinking that way a long time  <br/>\nago, and I was using phrases others were using anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis phrase which sounds really inspiring, maybe, is also not in my  <br/>\ncurrent voice or vocabulary:  &quot;The philosophies of choice, freedom,  <br/>\nchild-led learning, �bliss-led learning,� and personal responsibility  <br/>\ncan be honored and spread to new audiences by parents treating  <br/>\nchildren as humans with rights and responsibilities whether they are  <br/>\nsixteen, twelve, or eight years old.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to include all the terms in use in those days to describe  <br/>\nunschooling.  I certainly get it all and can defend it, but &quot;child-led  <br/>\nlearning&quot; has caused problems for people trying to get unschooling to  <br/>\nwork.  I used to assume that people would begin with a busy, enriched  <br/>\nand enriching life, but not everyone was making the same assumption or  <br/>\nstarting from the same place.  Some said &quot;We&#39;re unschooling, starting  <br/>\nnow,&quot; and then watched the kids to see when they were going to take  <br/>\ncontrol or direct their own learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices in an environment maintained with learning in mind are  <br/>\ndifferent from choices in a quiet, boring place.  If I were a kid, my  <br/>\nchoice in a quiet, boring place would be to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when I write that, in 1996, Holly was five years old.  Now she&#39;s  <br/>\nnearly eighteen.   -=-Although the ideal might be children who have  <br/>\nnever gone to school a day in their lives, reality isn�t always ideal.- <br/>\n=-    Holly has been to school five or six days in her life, but she  <br/>\nwas visiting, not enrolled, and wasn&#39;t always visiting a class of  <br/>\npeople her own age.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I didn&#39;t compromise my beliefs, and continued to clarify and  <br/>\nstrengthen them through discussions with other unschoolers, I have  <br/>\nchildren who have never gone to school.  A full set.  This is better  <br/>\nfor me than a college degree.  I&#39;ve done something really special now,  <br/>\nsomething I&#39;m proud of.  I stuck with a project for nineteen years.  I  <br/>\nwas willing to let the kids choose not to stay home, and so I took  <br/>\nthat gamble knowing that if home wasn&#39;t interesting enough school  <br/>\nstill existed.  If school was better than home, there it always was,  <br/>\nwalking distance from the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while Holly did consider going to middle school.  She asked kids  <br/>\nabout what they liked and didn&#39;t like, and she would sit outside when  <br/>\nschool let out and watch all the kids, see what they were wearing,  <br/>\nobserve the fashions of how to wear what kinds of backpacks, and think  <br/>\nabout it.   We talked about what she might need to do if she wanted to  <br/>\ngo, and while I wasn&#39;t wholly encouraging, I was willing.  She would  <br/>\nhave needed to practice her handwriting, and learn the pledge of  <br/>\nallegiance and a few things like that.  Not much.  She stayed home,  <br/>\nthough, and so I have &quot;the ideal&quot; as I stated it when Holly was  <br/>\n&quot;kindergarten age.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t register Holly to homeschool.  I had a backup plan (a copy of  <br/>\nthe registration papers, notarized with a date, in case anyone asked;  <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t sent it in, though).  I did that for a few years.  The  <br/>\nstate&#39;s processes and policies changed for registration, so I quit  <br/>\neven doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m rambling now, but it takes a while to tell twelves years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45844,"nextTopicId":46082}}
