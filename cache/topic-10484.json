Try this, the wind is tricky. The kids found mud and made a mud<br/>\ntarget, then painted with mud for awhile. We raked lots of wet colorful fallen<br/>\nleaves. Riley and I made bread. Tessa kneaded alot. I made chicken soup. We<br/>\nall have runny noses and coughs. We found out it&#39;s difficult to hear cars on<br/>\nthe road when the wind blows, so we didn&#39;t ride bikes around. Riley mastered<br/>\nthe pogo stick. He is up in the 100&#39;s now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to my first parent-teacher conference ever. My daughter now has<br/>\nofficial grades on record. I&#39;m still OK with her school experience. She is<br/>\nmaking very good friends with her teacher. She gave a book she bought and read<br/>\nas a present to her teacher&#39;s daughter, Somehow Ashley knows she likes pandas.<br/>\nI love spontaneous giving and felt proud seeing her send off something she<br/>\nbought a day earlier. She doesn&#39;t plan on going to 4th grade next year. She<br/>\nwill finish this year.. She is liking school mostly and is enjoying the work<br/>\nshe is responsible for.<br/>\n<br/>\n The house is mostly a mess, too small, and piled with our life. It&#39;s warm, 2<br/>\nkids are asleep and one reads. She picked up Harry Potter 4 again and is<br/>\nhooked. I&#39;ve yet to read it, but will as soon as she drifts off to sleep.<br/>\nTechnically, we are all home sick and I loved not having to go anywhere today.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10478,"nextTopicId":10431}}
