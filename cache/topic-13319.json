I&#39;ve always said and I<br/>\n&gt; stand by it today, I&#39;ll take a houseful of head colds any day over the<br/>\n&gt; stomach flu.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as food issues and food freedom, I myself feel that young<br/>\n&gt; children need to be guided and encouraged with what they eat.  I try to<br/>\n&gt; not have much &quot;junk&quot; food in the house but if it is here (thanks to dh)<br/>\n&gt; the girls would choose a bag of Cheetos over dinner.  I would let that<br/>\n&gt; slide on night maybe, but when they begin to expect that night after<br/>\n&gt; night I feel it would be wrong not to step in and say no.  If children<br/>\n&gt; are supposed to a protein daily, and your 2 yr old NEVER chooses<br/>\n&gt; anything with protein, what&#39;s a mom to do.  Sometimes kids don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; the knowledge to make the right choices.  I try very hard to give them<br/>\n&gt; choices and options, but in the end it&#39;s my job to make sure they are<br/>\n&gt; healthy and growing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do think that coming off a stomach flu, when your stomach can be<br/>\n&gt; tender and the body needs to catch up on lost calories, that&#39;s probably<br/>\n&gt; a good time to be relaxed about what they&#39;re eating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My sister&#39;s fil has diabetes and is in the last stages of the disease.<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s very sad.  I think because it is genetic, families with it need to<br/>\n&gt; be careful.  Maybe if you read up on it and spoke with doctors about<br/>\n&gt; what threat diabetes is to your family, you could have information to<br/>\n&gt; show you dh that he could relax a little.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck and feel better!

(The older two <br/>\nare now adults.)  My husband&#39;s mother is a diabetic, along with several of <br/>\nher 9 siblings, and her father was, too.  My husband has over half of the <br/>\nrisk factors for developing Type II (adult onset) diabetes.  It is clearly a <br/>\ndisease brought about by making bad food choices over a long period of time.  <br/>\nIt seems to me that making good food choices is harder the more insulin <br/>\nresistance you develop, so it&#39;s a vicious cycle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want my son or my husband to be a diabetic.  My husband and I have <br/>\nspent a lot of time learning about the disease and talking about it with an <br/>\neye towards prevention.  I talk to my son about listening to his body when <br/>\nhe&#39;s hungry, and I help him think about the food he&#39;s eaten lately, and think <br/>\nabout what opportunities he&#39;s going to have to eat in the near future.  (Are <br/>\nwe going out to dinner?  What will he eat at company picnic tomorrow?)  On <br/>\noccasion I ask if he&#39;s had any protein lately, especially if he&#39;s acting <br/>\nlistless or grumpy.  He&#39;s done some experimenting with food and the way he <br/>\nfeels afterward.  Donuts, he&#39;s discovered, make him very sleepy or cranky a <br/>\nfew hours later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay with him that I ask him questions about what he&#39;s eaten or plans to <br/>\neat.  He knows about diabetes and that he could be at risk, and he knows <br/>\nabout a lot of other things that could happen as a result of making choices <br/>\nwith his food (obesity, GERD which also seems to be in his family, etc.).  <br/>\nStill, I have rarely if ever said he couldn&#39;t have something he wanted, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t label food as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.  He has a varied palate, likes to try <br/>\nnew things, eats way more fruit and vegetables out of his own volition than <br/>\nhis friend who has been raised vegetarian!  He&#39;s asked for smoked salmon <br/>\nbecause it looked good in the store tho he&#39;d never tried it, and begged for 2 <br/>\nweeks for me to take him to try lobster.  (The smell of seafood makes me <br/>\nnauseated, I was waiting for Dad to come back from a trip so HE could take <br/>\nhim!)  The other day we were at the Blue Plate for lunch and he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nanything except banana pudding, so we ordered it.  For years the only thing <br/>\nhe would eat at Mexican restaurants was the cheese dip.  The other night at <br/>\nEl Nopal he ordered a tamale with rice and beans and cleaned his plate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think the whole freedom of food choices thing is working.  My husband <br/>\nhas been harder to convince, but he learned with the older two, who are his <br/>\nstep-sons, so the youngest has been spared.  Once, soon after we were <br/>\nmarried, he tried to get in a battle of wills over food with my middle son.  <br/>\nJon eventually complied and ate the food, but as soon as he left the table, <br/>\nthrew it up on the kitchen floor.  My husband will tell you he was then cured <br/>\nof the battle-of-wills part.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing them to making their own food choices and listening to their bodies <br/>\nwas a little harder for him.  I asked him to observe the way his mother eats. <br/>\n Her blood sugar is controlled with pills.  Yet her house is filled with <br/>\nsweet things.  She cooks lots of good foods, and cans her own vegetables.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s as if some doctor told her she could have sweets AS LONG AS she eats <br/>\nthe good stuff, too.  So she eats a few green beans and a small piece of <br/>\nchicken breast, and then loads her plate up with starchy pasta and potatoes <br/>\nand her sugar-free cakes (which are made with flour which also turns to sugar <br/>\nin the blood).  I&#39;m not blaming her so much as observing this with my own <br/>\neyes.  I believe the disease causes her cravings for sweets, and that&#39;s very <br/>\nhard to fight with simple willpower.  The way she cooks is the way my husband <br/>\nwas raised.  I asked him if he thought that was working?  (Like Dr. Phil, <br/>\n&quot;How&#39;s that working for ya?&quot;)  Did it work for him as a child?  Is it working <br/>\nfor her now?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe couldn&#39;t say that it worked.  And he realized he didn&#39;t have anything to <br/>\nlose by changing it around for his child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs with most of the changes unschooling brings to a family, it takes evidence <br/>\nseen with their own eyes over time to convince some people.  I asked my <br/>\nhusband to trust me, and he did, and he became convinced.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142809109,"authorName":"BADOLBILZ","from":"BADOLBILZ &lt;ynxn96@...&gt;","profile":"thedollymama2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When parents disagree","postDate":"1049724229","msgId":13320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFOTE4NTQ1LjkwMTAyMDFAZnJvbnRpZXJuZXQubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDgwMTU3NDUuMTA0OTY5ODEwNzY0OC5KYXZhTWFpbC5ub2JvZHlAZ3JvdmVyLnBzcC5wYXMuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":13319,"nextInTopic":13321,"prevInTime":13319,"nextInTime":13321,"topicId":13319,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Mary, sorry to hear everyone feels sick.

I&#39;ve always said and I <br/>\nstand by it today, I&#39;ll take a houseful of head colds any day over the <br/>\nstomach flu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food issues and food freedom, I myself feel that young <br/>\nchildren need to be guided and encouraged with what they eat.  I try to <br/>\nnot have much &quot;junk&quot; food in the house but if it is here (thanks to dh) <br/>\nthe girls would choose a bag of Cheetos over dinner.  I would let that <br/>\nslide on night maybe, but when they begin to expect that night after <br/>\nnight I feel it would be wrong not to step in and say no.  If children <br/>\nare supposed to a protein daily, and your 2 yr old NEVER chooses <br/>\nanything with protein, what&#39;s a mom to do.  Sometimes kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe knowledge to make the right choices.  I try very hard to give them <br/>\nchoices and options, but in the end it&#39;s my job to make sure they are <br/>\nhealthy and growing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that coming off a stomach flu, when your stomach can be <br/>\ntender and the body needs to catch up on lost calories, that&#39;s probably <br/>\na good time to be relaxed about what they&#39;re eating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister&#39;s fil has diabetes and is in the last stages of the disease. <br/>\n It&#39;s very sad.  I think because it is genetic, families with it need to <br/>\nbe careful.  Maybe if you read up on it and spoke with doctors about <br/>\nwhat threat diabetes is to your family, you could have information to <br/>\nshow you dh that he could relax a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and feel better!
