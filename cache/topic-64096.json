Maybe talk about adrenaline (maybe not using that term).  Marty described it, when  he was little:<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n I was mad. What do you guys think I should have done?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said, &quot;I know what to do, mom, when itï¿½s in your arms and in your legs.&quot; Marty was, at the age of three, describing an angry rush of adrenaline.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just breathe. Breathe deep breaths.&quot; That was the trick I had taught the kids, something I learned when I learned meditation. Oxygen will calm someone down.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that down when it happened, and wrote something about it later.  I had gotten tired and cranky and overwhelmed and swatted Marty on the leg.  People learn to find better ways gradually, and from wanting to find better ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut waiting until the kids are that angry and figuring out how to stop them isn&#39;t as good as backing up a few steps and figuring out how to avoid the anger stage.   I got better at not getting angry myself, but still, sometimes (of course) I get frustrated.  It&#39;s been a long time since I blamed others for &quot;making me angry,&quot; though.  I came to realize it was my reaction, and often it was because of other stresses, or hunger, or lack of sleep, or distraction about other problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say &quot;forgive yourself and move on.&quot;  That&#39;s good advice if &quot;moving on&quot; is moving toward a better choice the next time.  It&#39;s not good advice when it means &quot;sweep it under the rug; don&#39;t feel bad about anything you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some ideas for gradually moving toward having a more peaceful family in here, and in the sound file at the bottom.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Breaking others things in anger","postDate":"1323346656","msgId":64174,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjMzNDY2NTYuNDc1MDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzE5Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdDNTZDOEIxLTAwNEUtNDczMS04NDczLUE1Qjk2QzBEQ0U0MkB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":64173,"nextInTopic":64175,"prevInTime":64173,"nextInTime":64175,"topicId":64096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For clarification about being present, I m always present normally Being present is often more than just being there.

My daughter is 6 in a couple of weeks and I have a 2 1/2 yr old boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked out the causes of the two anger rages (a phonecall that went on too long and a disagreement about need to brush hair before a museum visit) and we&#39;ve done some problem solving around it. Plus there have been a few other factors which have caused the anger outbursts to be bigger/longer than normal (getting over colds and a few late nights).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not had too many problems dealing with her anger before, although I really have to work hard on maintaining my cool when she keeps trying to bite me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe current issue is breaking other peoples property in anger. During tonights outburst, she smashed her brothers toy box that holds his farm animals. Two days ago she ripped all the leaves off her Dads plant and cut up her younger brothers favourite pyjamas with scissors. <br/>\nMy first question is- when she is in the middle of destroying the item, do I wrestle the scissors off her? Do I hold her back from the plant till she calms down? Physically restraining her doesn&#39;t feel right, but I need to protect the things?<br/>\nSecondly, I told her tonight that she would have to pay to replace the PJs and toy box from her pocket money. I felt at the time that that&#39;s what happens- if you break something on purpose, you have to replace it. I didn&#39;t do this in anger or as a threat straight afterwards, but during a chat and cuddle we had afterwards. <br/>\nBut now I&#39;m not so sure. It feels like I&#39;m trying to &quot;teach her a lesson&quot;. Which isn&#39;t right. Do I just replace the things myself? She is very very sorry afterwards, she knows what she has done is wrong. Making her her pay to replace them- is that punishment?<br/>\nI&#39;m confused ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny light you may be able to shed would be appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nVanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling/unschooling (...

One.  (Later it was decided it was a plantain, which makes a big difference to some people, but I can&#39;t tell why.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine bought the books that came out during those excavations.

They weren&#39;t to actually cut or eat the pineapple, because that would cost them way too much, but just use it for its looks and return it undamaged so someone else could rent it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just too much for &quot;an educator&quot; to worry about.  That&#39;s for historians and archeologists and botanists and stuff.  They don&#39;t have to know those things, professional educators.  And one thing school seems to be all about, and increasingly so, is not to do ANYthing you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do, and not know anything that won&#39;t be on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling/unschooling (...

When people put their kids in a school, they drive there, sign papers, and leave the kids.  They KNOW which school their kids attend, because they have papers, an address, when they show up to pick the kid up he&#39;s there (ideally).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I think sometimes when people &quot;transfer&quot; their child from school to unschooling, they drive there (join a group), sign up, and think that they are now unschoolers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling has to be built, though, and we can&#39;t even send the parts.  People can buy a kit to buy a house (or have been able to in various times in the past, anyway)--used to be from Sears Robuck.  There were (might still be) log cabin kits sold in Colorado--every beam, every piece of rebar, diagrams, doors and windows.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In terms of houses, unschooling happens in whatever house you&#39;re already in, with the parents you already are, and the children you&#39;ve already created or gathered up.  We don&#39;t supply anything but the philosophy and a ton of examples and encouragement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, there are people &quot;selling&quot; unschooling (sometimes somewhat literally) who don&#39;t have a clue how it really works, because they themselves haven&#39;t done it for long, or haven&#39;t done it well, or haven&#39;t really done it at all.  They repeat the inspiring parts of what I&#39;ve written, or Joyce or someone else has written, and they think if they do what we&#39;re doing (what they think, from some distance we&#39;re doing) and &quot;do it nicer,&quot; that they will be leaders in the field.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People come here who have learned about unschooling other places, and assuming unschooling is some sort of monolithic, elemental thing, they complain to us that the log cabin kit they think they bought elsewhere didn&#39;t make a good house.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For anyone who has read this far and is confused, I recommend these links, in this order, for grounding:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/checklists\">http://sandradodd.com/checklists</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your unschooling needs to grow out of your own understanding of learning and parenting.

They KNOW which school their kids attend, because they have papers, an address, when they show up to pick the kid up he&#39;s there (ideally).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think sometimes when people &quot;transfer&quot; their child from school to unschooling, they drive there (join a group), sign up, and think that they are now unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has to be built, though, and we can&#39;t even send the parts.  People can buy a kit to buy a house (or have been able to in various times in the past, anyway)--used to be from Sears Robuck.  There were (might still be) log cabin kits sold in Colorado--every beam, every piece of rebar, diagrams, doors and windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of houses, unschooling happens in whatever house you&#39;re already in, with the parents you already are, and the children you&#39;ve already created or gathered up.  We don&#39;t supply anything but the philosophy and a ton of examples and encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, there are people &quot;selling&quot; unschooling (sometimes somewhat literally) who don&#39;t have a clue how it really works, because they themselves haven&#39;t done it for long, or haven&#39;t done it well, or haven&#39;t really done it at all.  They repeat the inspiring parts of what I&#39;ve written, or Joyce or someone else has written, and they think if they do what we&#39;re doing (what they think, from some distance we&#39;re doing) and &quot;do it nicer,&quot; that they will be leaders in the field.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople come here who have learned about unschooling other places, and assuming unschooling is some sort of monolithic, elemental thing, they complain to us that the log cabin kit they think they bought elsewhere didn&#39;t make a good house.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who has read this far and is confused, I recommend these links, in this order, for grounding:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/checklists\">http://sandradodd.com/checklists</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYour unschooling needs to grow out of your own understanding of learning and parenting.  This list, my books, my unschooling site, Just Add Light and Stir, and many other such resources by others can be used to help you build that understanding, but beware of shoddy materials and bad advice.  Choose your tools individually, rather than buying a cheap kit. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294145392,"authorName":"deedmeyer","from":"&quot;deedmeyer&quot; &lt;deedmeyer@...&gt;","profile":"deedmeyer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Learning all the time","postDate":"1323184423","msgId":64146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpibGJmNyt0NjNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjMxMzQxMDAuNDIzNjMuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjEyMDYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64137,"nextInTopic":64147,"prevInTime":64145,"nextInTime":64147,"topicId":64096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is it wrong that I am still confused about this?
