We&#39;re in a large-ish inclusive group and go to weekly park<br/>\ndays and my daughter also does on-again off-again ice skating lessons with<br/>\nthem, so Wally and I end up talking a lot to the other parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been with them for about 18 months now, and we&#39;ve been cheerfully out<br/>\nof the closet as radical unschoolers from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nice thing is, they&#39;re good people. They don&#39;t understand us completely<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;, but when they talk curriculum we just sit or do something else. When<br/>\nthey ask unschooling questions (&quot;How will they learn...&quot;) we answer. And we<br/>\ntalk about a lot of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the women is extremely anti-gun, anti-violence, etc. At one of the<br/>\nfirst park days we attended, something came up about one of the women whose<br/>\nhusband hunts, and I mentioned Wally is a competitive target shooter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe anti-gun homeschooler and Wally are now good friends. Her husband brings<br/>\npacking peanuts home from work by the sackload for us to use for our mail<br/>\norder business. Wally went with their family to MacWorld in San Francisco<br/>\nthis year. We&#39;ve been to their house for dinner and game night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, friendships can happen in the unlikeliest places. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were looking to the park day group for unschooling support, I&#39;m sure<br/>\nI&#39;d be wild with frustration, but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, it&#39;s uncomfortable. Sometimes, one of the parents will say<br/>\nsomething like, &quot;Devin couldn&#39;t come to park day last week because he didn&#39;t<br/>\nfinish his math.&quot; Sometimes, I want to grab Devin on the spot and adopt him.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt; But we get through.

I am definitely feeling that way myself at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been homeschooling my boys (9 & 10) for 5 years with this group, going along with all they do. But since September my ideas have changed towards radical unschooling, which I am doing now. There is one person in the group who understands and says she is *mostly* an unschooler, but I can see she does not unschool quite like I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to go to the group because of the friends my boys have made with the kids in this group. And I have no problem with the kids, I think they are all very special. But I am longing to meet with other unschoolers who share my (new) philosophy. I&#39;m not having much luck finding anyone. So until I ever do meet other &quot;real&quot; unschoolers, I&#39;m sticking with my original group and finding my unschooling support online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also understand about helping others in their journey -- I&#39;ve been much more outspoken recently about unschooling and what it is and why I&#39;m doing it. Most people I talk to say &quot;yeah, it&#39;s a good idea but I could never do it. I need my kids to have more structure, to have a classical education, blah, blah, blah&quot;. I&#39;m feeling more and more isolated in all the curriculum talk and using Saxon and homeschooling &quot;all year long&quot; because they feel so behind in their school work. I tell them &quot;it&#39;s great at our house - it&#39;s like summer vacation every day, all year long&quot; and they look at me like I&#39;m a little crazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all I can say is I hear you and understand how you&#39;re feeling and I&#39;m jealous you even have some other unschoolers in your group!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\non the lookout in Phoenix, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bronwen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi list!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My name is Bronwen and I just jumped on this list.

I realized<br/>\nthis because recently there was a secret blow out where my parenting<br/>\n(philosophy) came into question (by a woman who has been homeschooling her<br/>\n12 year old *one* year) ..ugh..  It was &quot;handled&quot;.  But now I feel<br/>\nuncomfortable and a bit defensive..I really am a radical unschooler.  ( I<br/>\nhave this underlying yearning to &quot;nail&quot; the woman with words..hee hee<br/>\nbecause as you all must know, I&#39;m RIGHT- unschooling rules!, BUT ..i have to<br/>\nbe diplomatic..)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I am really feeling good about helping others on their journey<br/>\nwith this- understanding what real freedom means..  but now I am wondering..<br/>\nI mean, do you all mix with the &quot;homeschoolers&quot; frequently?-  am I really<br/>\ngoing to be of help there? am I going to get a feeling of community and<br/>\nsupport from a group that generally doesn&#39;t share my philosophy and have<br/>\nchildren younger than mine?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I guess the bottom line is I will keep going as long as my sons want<br/>\nto,  and I really enjoy at least two people in the group, . there are<br/>\ndefinately no other &quot;better&quot; groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny one work on this kind of thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for letting me process,<br/>\nBronwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3595,"nextTopicId":3603}}
