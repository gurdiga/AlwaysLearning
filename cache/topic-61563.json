To make one valedictorian, dozens or hundreds or thousands of kids in that same graduating class are not the valedictorian.   And some percentage of those who might have been graduating have dropped out before graduation.   And some who are graduating have barely graduated and might feel not-very-smart for the rest of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler was writing about people who go on to university.<br/>\nMANY who graduate don&#39;t even think about university because by the time they squeak through graduation they had school and everything that looks like school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said &quot;slag and waste&quot; above, I meant human waste.  Every school knows that a fairly big percentage of their kids will fail.  WILL fail.  Not &quot;might fail.&quot;  School is set up to sort the best from the worst.  Being &quot;best&quot; is worthless without some having been measured &quot;worst.&quot;  And those kids are whole humans with parents who love them.  And they fail.
