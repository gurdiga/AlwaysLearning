Well, tonight they<br/>\n&gt;sent out word that YahooGroups in the USA will also be down, from Friday<br/>\n&gt;night thru Sunday morning (so at least it&#39;s supposed to be less time than<br/>\n&gt;UK).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you want to see the official message, go to the home page of yahoo<br/>\n&gt;(http://www.groups.yahoo.com) it&#39;s a service announcement on the right hand<br/>\n&gt;side.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I followed the link, clicked on another link &quot;for more information,&quot; <br/>\nand found this notice:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Dear Yahoo! Groups Members,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Yahoo! Groups service will be down Friday March 15 9:00 PM PST <br/>\n&gt;(GMT-8) as we move our servers to a new facility. We expect the <br/>\n&gt;service to be back up the morning of Sunday March 17.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;During this time the web site will be unavailable and email will not <br/>\n&gt;be delivered. (Some users may experience email non-delivery notices, <br/>\n&gt;but all email should be delivered once service has resumed.) Please <br/>\n&gt;note: once the service is back up, there will be email delays due to <br/>\n&gt;backlog. We expect these delays to last no longer than 1 day. Please <br/>\n&gt;do not re-send email to your group as it will only add to delays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Yahoo! Groups Team </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5448,"nextTopicId":5492}}
