I don&#39;t<br/>\neven think falling in line helps set someone up for &quot;big monies and easy<br/>\nliving&quot;.  The only people that I&#39;ve known that have &quot;big monies and easy<br/>\nliving&quot; had really generous and wealthy parents.  Someone worked very<br/>\nhard to earn that &quot;big monies and easy living&quot; to pass on to the next<br/>\ngeneration.  Just look at Paris Hilton, the Hilton family started off<br/>\nwith a B and B, and the man who started the hotel chain, did all the<br/>\nduties a bell boy would do, carry luggage to and from the train to the B<br/>\nand B that his parents owned.  He worked HARD for years and took a<br/>\ngamble at expanding and it worked.  I doubt very much that he &quot;fell in<br/>\nline&quot; to get that hotel empire up and going!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery person that has been successful like that has NOT been a person<br/>\nthat has fallen in line!  Perhaps, one day, that person will realize<br/>\nwhat I lie they&#39;ve been told!  I went to school for 17 yrs and I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave &quot;big monies and easy living&quot;.  I have small monies and happy<br/>\nliving.  Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m shy of the 20 yrs mark that this<br/>\nperson suggested.  Ahhh if only I&#39;d stuck it out for another 3 more<br/>\nyrs... but I&#39;m thinking I&#39;d still be a stay at home mom, and my student<br/>\nloans would just be bigger.  I have friends that pay out over a thousand<br/>\ndollars a month for student loans.
