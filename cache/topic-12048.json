Sort of babysitting rather being a parent of the great awakening!<br/>\nBrianna is 10. I am constantly amazed at the wonder of her. She does so many<br/>\nthings, says so many things that I would miss were I working outside our<br/>\nhome. It&#39;s only Brianna & me, (well we have a dog and three birds) She&#39;s a<br/>\nconstant joy. Why would anyone want to miss this?<br/>\nI have wondered why people have kids only to put them here, place them<br/>\nthere.<br/>\nI can&#39;t buy that &quot;we need two incomes&quot; argument.<br/>\nBrianna & I are a one-income family, and it&#39;s low income. We don&#39;t have many<br/>\nthings. We do have each other. We do have a relationship that&#39;s based on<br/>\ntrust, love, respect with a great dose of humor.  Brianna would be shocked<br/>\nif I said something like that. She would also not believe it!<br/>\nI feel sorry for those that are just going through the moves, not really<br/>\nparticipating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCoyotes Corner<br/>\nVery Cool Stuff for the World<br/>\n&lt;www.coyotescorner.com&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 30, 2003 4:22 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] ...doing great<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Huh&quot; indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder whether she&#39;ll put him up for adoption soon or if she really meant<br/>\nto have a living, breathing, thinking baby in her life?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;m back from maternity leave as of yesterday!

Man, this stuff is so sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiam and I were talking one day, and he had heard that some moms are really <br/>\nglad to see their kids off to school at the end of vacations (I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nwhere he heard this from), and he says he thinks that these moms &quot;hate <br/>\ntheir kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it made me remember when I was little.  My mom worked full time-plus <br/>\n(meaning weekends and late nights), and when summer vacation rolled around, <br/>\nwe kids got packed off to sleep-away summer camp for the whole summer (save <br/>\nthe last two weeks before school started, which was our family&#39;s summer <br/>\nvacation when we would go away to the beach - I went straight from camp to <br/>\nthe beach and only got to be home the weekend before school started again <br/>\nin September).  From my perspective now, I know she wanted us to have fun <br/>\nand all and she worked real hard to be able to send three kids to <br/>\nsleep-away camp for SIX weeks, but back then I couldn&#39;t get over the <br/>\nfeeling that she just really wanted to get rid of us kids.  I know I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have taken it so personally, but there you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also vividly remember thinking that if I had had the choice, I would have <br/>\nloved to have stayed at home and be with my friends and folks and sleep <br/>\nlate and go to the park and enjoy a lazy summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji, reminiscing now about lazy summers.  -=-sigh-=- only 21 more weeks <br/>\nto go (but who&#39;s counting) (G) <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2375171,"authorName":"sluror@juno.com","from":"sluror@...","profile":"sluror","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ...doing great","postDate":"1043904917","msgId":12050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTI5LjIyMzUxOS4tMzM1ODYzLjAuc2x1cm9yQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12048,"nextInTopic":12052,"prevInTime":12049,"nextInTime":12051,"topicId":12048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-387888362\">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m back from maternity leave as of yesterday!
