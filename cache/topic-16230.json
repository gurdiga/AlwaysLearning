Do any of you have experiences with this?<br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why was it okay to get the German program, but the math is causing <br/>\nyou conflict?  I have never seen unschooling as rejecting all school <br/>\nlike things.  In fact,  my dd just expressed to me that she would <br/>\nlike to learn a little more math.  Stuff kids in school are learning, <br/>\njust so she knows what it is.  So now I&#39;m on a search for a good math <br/>\nprogram.<br/>\nSo what did your dd finally choose?<br/>\nCarly (almost 13) has never been one to care about school or what <br/>\nthey were doing there.  She&#39;s been the ultimate unschooler, <br/>\ncompletely rejecting their notions.  This new attitude suprised me, <br/>\nbut does not concern me.  If we start learning more math and she <br/>\ndecides, &quot;oh never mind, this isn&#39;t fun/interesting/what I thought it <br/>\nwould be....&quot;, then that&#39;s a learning experience.  If she finds she <br/>\nlikes it, sees it as a puzzle to figure out....whatever, that&#39;s cool <br/>\ntoo. I&#39;m not going to question her motives or try to dissuade her.  <br/>\nI&#39;m going to trust her in knowing what she wants, and help her <br/>\nachieve her goals and accept her decisions, whatever the outcome.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] new to this group-help-long","postDate":"1061663726","msgId":16233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWMzNjlhNSRjMzU4YzE4MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJpNXAzaitxYjc0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16232,"nextInTopic":16258,"prevInTime":16232,"nextInTime":16234,"topicId":16230,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Why not contact the colleges she is considering and ask for an application package to determine exactly what each requires?

I have two children, a daughter age 15, and <br/>\na son age 12. I practice attachment parenting, I breast fed both kids <br/>\nuntil they were over three. We have always homeschooled, neither has <br/>\never had a curriculum. Lately my dd has been looking forward to <br/>\ncollege. She wants to go soon, and wants to start using some sort of <br/>\ncurriculum. I have asked her why she feels she needs this, and she <br/>\nfeels she lacks some of the math knowledge needed. I am confused as <br/>\nto where this has all come from. She can do calculations in her head. <br/>\nShe has helped me with budgets and other things for years and knows <br/>\nthings like percentages, place values, how to multiply and divide. <br/>\nWhat more does she need to know, that she can&#39;t learn once she gets <br/>\nthere? She is worried about a transcript, which most of the colleges <br/>\nshe wants to go to require. I showed her all the journals I have kept <br/>\nover the years, I told her how we can sit down together and put a <br/>\ntranscript together. We can put down all of the theater productions <br/>\nshe has been involved in, samples of her art work, she can write a <br/>\npaper in German to show her ability there. (we did buy a German <br/>\nlanguage program when she was ten, and she loves it.) We can have a <br/>\nwonderful, creative, well rounded transcript. She states that most of <br/>\nthe colleges she is looking at require at least two to three years of <br/>\nhigh school math and she is afraid she does not have it. I have <br/>\nassured her we will come up with a great way to translate what she <br/>\nhas done into some sort of schoolease jargon. All of this and she <br/>\nstill isn&#39;t reassured. She sent away to some companies and has poured <br/>\nover catalogs and says she has found the program she wants to work <br/>\nthrough. I have looked at it, it isn&#39;t too expensive, it seems <br/>\ncomprehensive. I have no doubt she will be able to work through it. <br/>\nThat isn&#39;t my problem. I am having as much trouble with my <br/>\nphilosophical values, as she is with hers. I have embarrassed the <br/>\nunschooling, child-led lifestyle since before my kids were born. I am <br/>\nhaving conflicting emotions. On one hand I should get this for her <br/>\nbecause she has initiated it, it is child-led because she wants this, <br/>\nnot me. On the other hand I reject prepackaged curriculum and all <br/>\nthat comes from that. Do any of you have experiences with this?<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16238,"nextTopicId":16259}}
