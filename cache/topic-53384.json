If I were a needy kid again,<br/>\nyou&#39;re house is where I&#39;d gravitate.<br/>\nI imagined creating this kind of home for my kids (I then thought it&#39;d be<br/>\nafter school and weekends ;)), where the neighborhood would congregate, so<br/>\nmy kids would still be with me. I do remember the overwhelm, especially when<br/>\nmy kids were younger. We had a pool and lots of fun stuff to play with AND<br/>\nparents who *gasp* played WITH kids!!!! And had fun!!!! What a novel concept<br/>\nwe introduced to our neighborhood.<br/>\nMitch&#39;s last summer was like you mentioned: I wanted to be with my family<br/>\nalone and the whole neighborhood wanted to be at our house and our kids<br/>\nwanted to be with the family and their friends. We were already connected as<br/>\na family in this intense way, a way like no one else we knew; to continue<br/>\nthis connectedness in the face of DH&#39;s cancer was just bizarre. And<br/>\nbeautiful.<br/>\n*I* realized that all too quickly, this too shall pass, all of it.  I<br/>\nconnected with Mitch by co-parenting with him for every last minute I could<br/>\nhave his support.<br/>\nTHIS is what this stage of our marriage was about: the family, the kids, the<br/>\nlaughter, the win/win/win of it all.  We went into our marriage with a<br/>\ncommitment to these things, believing we&#39;d have time to focus more on us as<br/>\nthe kids eventually stopped being kids.<br/>\nWhat we shared, in those last few weeks of Mitch&#39;s life, was an example like<br/>\nnone other to those kids in the neighborhood.

We spent a lot of time, when the kids were  <br/>\nyounger, at medieval-themed camping events.  We would be there two or  <br/>\nthree days, or a couple of times for a week, and our camp invariably  <br/>\nbecame the place other kids would come over in the morning to play.   <br/>\nSo what we did was to make sure we had a clear place for them to &quot;play  <br/>\nboffers&quot; (foam swords) and that we had enough for several kids.  I had  <br/>\na basket of &quot;medieval toys&quot; (wooden and metal things I had picked up  <br/>\nover the years that could have been around before 1600--carved horses  <br/>\nand a wooden elephant, string toys that climbed, small wooden dishes,  <br/>\na couple of those wheeled persian brass horses, some temple toys from  <br/>\nIndia (small metal wheeled animals).  We put those out where younger  <br/>\nkids could play with them.  We had a wooden rocking horse (not  <br/>\nelaborately carved, very simple) and we would take that.   We would  <br/>\nput out water and little-kid snacks (monkey-platter-style).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit to us was that we knew where our own children were and  <br/>\ncould protect them and enjoy watching them play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat came to mind because it wasn&#39;t &quot;our house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve used Katy&#39;s plan too, to not be home when school was out.  At  <br/>\nour old house we had a swingset, treehouse, sandbox and covered patio,  <br/>\nand there were about a dozen other kids our kids&#39; ages within the  <br/>\neight or ten nearest houses.   I would suck it up and let them come  <br/>\nover, and pay enough attention that I could address a problem and  <br/>\nmaybe tell a kid to be nicer or go home.

My first thought, though, is that it sounds like your kids really want to be with their friends! Can you find a way to focus on their joy, rather than your desire for peace and quiet?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you NEVER have family time, but closing the curtains so your kids can&#39;t see other kids seems a little extreme. If they see them, and want to play, find ways to facilitate that. Find other ways to meet your need for quiet, at other times. I&#39;m an introvert, so I understand that need - I&#39;ve learned to embrace my kids&#39; joy, though, and appreciate each moment they&#39;re happy and engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what made the difference for me, when I stopped trying to take time away from my kids for &quot;me&quot;? I took a drum circle into a kid&#39;s cancer ward at the hospital here, and seeing kids who *couldn&#39;t* get up and play, who were NOT being boisterous and loud - that made a HUGE impression on me. It was so... unnatural. Your kids are kids. Kids are loud, and messy, and things break. Kids are more important than a muddy yard, or things. Since your kids are younger, maybe you didn&#39;t experience the noise and mess so much with *just them*, so you&#39;re seeing these &quot;others&quot; as the problem. But your kids WANT that!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the change needs to happen within YOU.

No one responded to my previous post. Maybe I<br/>\n&gt; was too vague before. Or maybe I sounded like a jerk.<br/>\n&gt; It was an understatement to say I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed. There are 6<br/>\n&gt; (sometimes 7) households who have kids in our two adjacent culdesac blocks,<br/>\n&gt; and the neighborhood kids (all schooled) gravitate toward our property<br/>\n&gt; nearly everyday. The exception is when the weather is bad. They sometimes<br/>\n&gt; trickle in and out throughout the day, different kids coming and going, but<br/>\n&gt; sometimes they end up here all at once. They come as soon as they get home<br/>\n&gt; from school or their after school programs...as soon as we get up in the<br/>\n&gt; morning on the weekends (or during their vacations from school)...and as<br/>\n&gt; soon as they see us come home (when I manage to get us out of here once in a<br/>\n&gt; while.) My kids, especially my 6 year old, wants to be out there playing<br/>\n&gt; with any of them, anytime he sees someone out. Even if we were in the middle<br/>\n&gt; of something, or if we had plans(even plans for things he really did want to<br/>\n&gt; do.) Sometimes I get split between my kids if one or more wants to go out,<br/>\n&gt; and one wants to stay in, or if I was in the middle of trying to give my<br/>\n&gt; toddler a bath when neighbors start showing up; for example. When my<br/>\n&gt; daughter sees my son(s) go out, she almost always immediately wants to go<br/>\n&gt; out too. Sometimes I let the neighbors come in, but it gets so loud and so<br/>\n&gt; messy that I think I&#39;m going to burst. The neighborhood kids are almost all<br/>\n&gt; older (except for the 4 year old boy across the street who is not nice to my<br/>\n&gt; daughter) and they range in ages from 7 to 10. So their parents are never<br/>\n&gt; supervising them outside, even the 4 year old&#39;s parents don&#39;t supervise him<br/>\n&gt; very closely since we live right across the street and there is very little<br/>\n&gt; traffic. Two of the dads have told us that if his child/kids get to be too<br/>\n&gt; much just send them home, but there are two problems with that, one or both<br/>\n&gt; of my sons get really upset if I tell their friends to go home (or if I try<br/>\n&gt; to get us to go in the house) and sometimes the neighbor kids just don&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt; home...they just linger in front of our property or keep playing in the<br/>\n&gt; street. I can&#39;t control other people&#39;s kids, it is not MY street, I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; actually make anyone else go home and stay out of sight. And I feel like I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t get a good stretch of peaceful time either. I can&#39;t just send my kids<br/>\n&gt; out to play alone, nor do I want to. I HAVE to be around...especially since<br/>\n&gt; the dynamics (and safety) changes as the kids come and go...and of course,<br/>\n&gt; my kids are young. If I get pulled away from the group of kids (for a diaper<br/>\n&gt; change, going in to grab water, trying to attend to my dogs or cats, or<br/>\n&gt; whatever) then I sometimes come back to find that a neighbor kid has pulled<br/>\n&gt; out my hose and made a mud puddle or broken something. It&#39;s like if I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t specifically forbade something (you know, made a rule) then they<br/>\n&gt; figure it is fair game. Sometimes I just want to hang out with my own kids<br/>\n&gt; during the daytime, and enjoy my own yard with my own kids alone; but my son<br/>\n&gt; escalates into full blown crying if I try to say his friends can&#39;t play with<br/>\n&gt; him right now. I feel so trapped and powerless. I&#39;d like to spend time with<br/>\n&gt; my husband, but when he&#39;s home, we are often split between him playing with<br/>\n&gt; a crowd of kids (including some of ours) in the front or in the street, and<br/>\n&gt; me trying to prep food or take care of another kid in the house. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m bitter when imagining the other parents getting to enjoy quiet, kid-free<br/>\n&gt; days at their homes while I&#39;m treated like their daycare (without the<br/>\n&gt; benefit of income or other parent provided snacks.) I am not saying that I<br/>\n&gt; want a kid free home myself, but I just want it to be friend-free more<br/>\n&gt; often. I know my home is fun and attractive to kids in the neighborhood, and<br/>\n&gt; I know that some day I will be so grateful that my kids are here and not off<br/>\n&gt; somewhere else. But right now I&#39;m feeling taken advantage of and I can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; a way out. My friend in another state suggested that we tell all of the<br/>\n&gt; other kids&#39; parents that we want one or two specific days to be alone with<br/>\n&gt; our kids and to not have their kids come over. I thought that was a good<br/>\n&gt; idea, but the more I thought about it, I figured it won&#39;t work. All of our<br/>\n&gt; households live so close it wouldn&#39;t matter what we told the parents of<br/>\n&gt; those older kids. On the sunny days the parents would just tell their kids<br/>\n&gt; to go outside to play, and then my kids would just see the other kids<br/>\n&gt; playing in the street (or other yards) and would want to go outside to play<br/>\n&gt; with them too...no matter what we had planned. My kids are so young too,<br/>\n&gt; that they stop listening (and often walk away) if I try to explain. It is<br/>\n&gt; also impossible to talk when it escalates to crying and screaming.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I cracked this evening when we came home from an outing to find 2 of the<br/>\n&gt; friends out waiting for us. My husband sighed at the sight of them, and I<br/>\n&gt; said I&#39;d tell them to go home. Which I did, but they didn&#39;t go. And my 6 yr<br/>\n&gt; old started crying and saying he wanted to play with his friends (even<br/>\n&gt; though we had all talked about other evening plans on our way home.)Then<br/>\n&gt; another, and other kid showed up. And I was about to be the crazy crying<br/>\n&gt; lady on the driveway. So I had to run to the bathroom, shut the door, scream<br/>\n&gt; at the top of my lungs, and cry by myself...and let my husband go hang out<br/>\n&gt; with the crowd again. I was sobbing, and imagining yelling at them to all<br/>\n&gt; get the f- off my property, and almost convincing myself that we have to<br/>\n&gt; move. To somewhere with land.<br/>\n&gt; And no friends.<br/>\n&gt; Crazy, I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having vented all this, I know logically that it is not worth the<br/>\n&gt; relationship to make Evan feel bad and have him cry when he simply wants to<br/>\n&gt; go play with his friends. And I try to tell myself all the time that it is<br/>\n&gt; all about my attitude and I should be present and have fun no matter what.<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;m tired of being present for so many kids, kids who are parented<br/>\n&gt; differently, and who pass along so much school type social stuff that my<br/>\n&gt; husband and I then have to deal with, and help our kids navigate through.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I&#39;ve tried things like putting a sign on the door that says, &quot;Do<br/>\n&gt; not knock&quot; or closing my curtains when I see the kids in the street (before<br/>\n&gt; my kids see them,) to try to buy myself a little more alone time with them.<br/>\n&gt; But it feels kinda sneaky, and then I&#39;m also back to wishing I could go<br/>\n&gt; outside and enjoy the sun and not be trapped inside.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I&#39;ve typed a bunch. At least my husband was awesome to take care of<br/>\n&gt; everything so I could take a time out and write this.

So I&#39;m trying to be<br/>\ncreative here:<br/>\n<br/>\n- (taking a long term approach as in this I&#39;m thinking so many parents have<br/>\nforgotten how to have that kind of fun - maybe your neighbours need to<br/>\nrelearn it?) --- maybe if you could find a way to make it seem like fun for<br/>\nthe other parents (anyone else have ideas for that?), say invite them to<br/>\nparticipate in outdoor games with you or your husband and the children?<br/>\nWhen they rediscover the fun... maybe they&#39;ll step up more?<br/>\n- what kind of outdoor games benefit from a bit of structure that need older<br/>\npeople, and are fun for older people?<br/>\n- could be on a family by family invitation maybe,<br/>\n- or even try to create one or a series of block parties - it might take a<br/>\nbit of planning to organise games enough to involve parents so they don&#39;t<br/>\nsit around chatting/eating & ignoring kids.<br/>\n- it  might be worth identifying the best stories that highlight the best<br/>\nparts about being there which you and your hubby have experienced - stories<br/>\nto share to entice the other parents out?<br/>\n- how much time have you spent with the other parents? Have you discovered<br/>\ntheir talents or areas of interest that some of the children might be<br/>\ninterested to discover eventually?<br/>\n<br/>\n- from another angle, maybe the occasional direct request over a friendly<br/>\ncuppa?  Mention something you need to do, and something else the children<br/>\nwant to do together, and is there a time the other parent might be available<br/>\nto help the children out with their activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t done any of the above as a deliberate move to get parents<br/>\ninvolved, but in some places we&#39;ve lived that is how things casually came<br/>\nabout with one or two families: from connecting socially with neighbouring<br/>\nfamilies we become more cooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not directly useful, maybe they will stimulate better ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nMica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197421595,"authorName":"Katy Jennings","from":"Katy Jennings &lt;kjennings95@...&gt;","profile":"coyotegoddess95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Need help & ideas!

Can you get out of the house before they get out of school, and not come home until it is too late for them to come?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just one or two days a week, get out of the house, maybe have a picnic dinner and have your husband meet you in a park or something after work and eat there.  Let your kids play, go home fairly late.  Just a couple of days a week may give you a break.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can plan things for weekends I would get out before they are out!  Then relax somewhere.  We camp a lot, especially during the summer, gone the whole weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not good with dealing with people, so my ideas are all about getting away!  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRichard, now 14, had a few friends that used to drive me nuts when he was little.  Mean kids, I never understood why he liked them.  They would be at the house all of the time, I provided snacks and drinks, they never went to anyone else&#39;s house to play.  It was getting expensive, and I was getting frustrated.  But it trickled off.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would have told them that they needed to be nice to be at my house, but there were never any specific incidents, it was just a feeling of not nice-ness at times, I couldn&#39;t exactly put my finger on it to figure out how to fix it.  I probably was not present enough, I don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest meanest thing was when one of the kids broke Richard&#39;s favorite cup, on purpose, when Richard had let him use it because it was his favorite.  Richard was trying to do something nice for his friend, and the boy set it on the ground and did a running kick, it shattered.  Richard cleaned it up quickly and told me later (they were 8 or so, I had been just inside watching some, but not as close as I should have been).  I was going to talk to him about that the next time he came, but it was a while before he did, and after that it was less and less that he came over, and Richard was ok with that.  Maybe he knew that he had crossed a line, or maybe Richard said something, I don&#39;t know.  He still lives down the street, but never comes by now.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other kids were brothers, and their dad got divorced from their step-mom (they lived with their mom, but were at dad&#39;s a lot, right across the street from us), then the dad lost his job and moved away.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow Richard&#39;s best friend lives across the street (down a few from where the other kids lived), he is 3.5 years older than Richard but they have been best buddies for 5 or 6 years.  He is great.  He just joined the army, leaving for basic in July, Richard and I are both sad.  Richard does not have a lot of friends, he tends to be like me, a few really good friends rather than tons of &quot;just ok&quot; friends, as he puts it.  It will probably be pretty hard when he leaves.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had some great ideas for you.  Kids get older, the dynamics between them change.  I hope things get better soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":326782993,"authorName":"Vidyut Kale","from":"Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt;","profile":"vidyutgore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need help & ideas!

Things are looking awful, someone else<br/>\nhas all the power and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt likely will not change the situation directly, but I&#39;d invite you to look<br/>\nat what else is there. What is also happening as your kids head out to play<br/>\nwith these tempting (for them :P) other kids. The bonds of friendship being<br/>\nformed, asserting their own social life (gracelessly as it seems), loads of<br/>\ndoing all kinds of stuff. Loads of learning (like playing a video game all<br/>\nday :D). I find that if I can become able to tune in to what&#39;s working well,<br/>\nbad situations hassle me less and stop being bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its a cultural thing, but I grew up in a housing society - perhaps it<br/>\ncould be called an apartment complex? (buildings with apartments and<br/>\napartments in them and common playground). Gangs of kids were more the norm<br/>\nthan the exception. I can completely visualize the situation, because &#39;been<br/>\nthere&#39;. Camped out in front of friend&#39;s places trying to get them out, had<br/>\nfriends camped outside our door.... I don&#39;t know a single thing short of<br/>\nimprisonment that could have stopped us from doing that, which our schooly<br/>\nfamilies couldn&#39;t do, forget someone who is sensitive to the desires of a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to live in a rural society in a past life and had some beaooootiful<br/>\nhorses. I didn&#39;t have a single child, but all the village kids could be<br/>\nfound hanging out somewhere near our camp (nomadic horsewoman). Didn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter where we were. Didn&#39;t matter if the kids knew us. Didn&#39;t matter if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want them around, or if they were complicating work, or crowding my<br/>\npersonal space. They were like permanent features of the camp. It was like<br/>\nits no use saying &quot;that window is really okay sometimes, but I wish it would<br/>\nbecome a wall once in a while :D&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized that my place was a kid magnet because they thought it was cool.<br/>\nThere were plenty of horsemen, but the way I was with my horses and Pye (my<br/>\ndog, bitch actually) made my horses more &#39;real horses&#39; to those kids - even<br/>\nkids whose families owned a couple of them. They were fascinated by my<br/>\nresponses to their non-verbal language. It was magic. They were fascinated<br/>\nby the care, caring in illness, finding out what&#39;s wrong (THAT was a big<br/>\none!). They wanted to be a part of that picture. Many parents told me that I<br/>\ncould just ask them to follow me, and like the pied piper, they would come<br/>\nalong.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions were like a blizzard, and I used to get tired of answering them. I<br/>\nactually love interacting with kids (which probably was what attracted<br/>\nthem), but I was one person, and at least half a dozen kids, all day. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t leave camp at all, because I was scared one of them would give in<br/>\nto temptation and get too close to the horses and have an accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started telling them odd jobs, feeling vaguely guilty about putting<br/>\nthem to work. My objective was to keep them occupied and out of trouble<br/>\nwhere I could see them. I wish I had a kid I could mix in with them and<br/>\ndirect the entire gang with suggestions to one child (I did start using some<br/>\nof the older regular ones like that - sort of &#39;hosts&#39;, particularly when I<br/>\nhad to go anywhere - to keep everyone away from the horses). But these kids<br/>\nloved working. To them, that was &#39;real work&#39;. Mucking? Drinking water?<br/>\nChopping wood (older ones)? Whatever. &quot;We love all this stuff. (Just don&#39;t<br/>\ntell us to go.)&quot; This evolved to &#39;maths and english&#39; tutions - with fees in<br/>\nwood, grass, butter, milk, rice, odd jobs.... when parents started hanging<br/>\naround too, trying to get me to make their kids &#39;smart like me&#39;. I never did<br/>\nmanage to get rid of the kids. Eventually I left the mountains and returned<br/>\nto the city (not because of the kids :P).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is that sometimes these things are larger than us and<br/>\nhave a life of their own, regardless of who owns the property they happen<br/>\non. It may not be so in your case. You may successfully &#39;kid control&#39; your<br/>\nlife. But even if that doesn&#39;t happen, there are things you can do with the<br/>\nsituation that you will like better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case it is a tremendous compliment to you and the environment you<br/>\ncreate, if kids will come there voluntarily and consistently. Its like<br/>\nexotic butterflies being attracted to a garden. They flap in our faces,<br/>\nsure, but they are also very beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need help & ideas!

Or maybe I sounded like a jerk. <br/>\nIt was an understatement to say I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed. There are 6 (sometimes 7) households who have kids in our two adjacent culdesac blocks, and the neighborhood kids (all schooled) gravitate toward our property nearly everyday. The exception is when the weather is bad. They sometimes trickle in and out throughout the day, different kids coming and going, but sometimes they end up here all at once. They come as soon as they get home from school or their after school programs...as soon as we get up in the morning on the weekends (or during their vacations from school)...and as soon as they see us come home (when I manage to get us out of here once in a while.) My kids, especially my 6 year old, wants to be out there playing with any of them, anytime he sees someone out. Even if we were in the middle of something, or if we had plans(even plans for things he really did want to do.) Sometimes I get split between my kids if one or more wants to go out, and one wants to stay in, or if I was in the middle of trying to give my toddler a bath when neighbors start showing up; for example. When my daughter sees my son(s) go out, she almost always immediately wants to go out too. Sometimes I let the neighbors come in, but it gets so loud and so messy that I think I&#39;m going to burst. The neighborhood kids are almost all older (except for the 4 year old boy across the street who is not nice to my daughter) and they range in ages from 7 to 10. So their parents are never supervising them outside, even the 4 year old&#39;s parents don&#39;t supervise him very closely since we live right across the street and there is very little traffic. Two of the dads have told us that if his child/kids get to be too much just send them home, but there are two problems with that, one or both of my sons get really upset if I tell their friends to go home (or if I try to get us to go in the house) and sometimes the neighbor kids just don&#39;t go home...they just linger in front of our property or keep playing in the street. I can&#39;t control other people&#39;s kids, it is not MY street, I can&#39;t actually make anyone else go home and stay out of sight. And I feel like I can&#39;t get a good stretch of peaceful time either. I can&#39;t just send my kids out to play alone, nor do I want to. I HAVE to be around...especially since the dynamics (and safety) changes as the kids come and go...and of course, my kids are young. If I get pulled away from the group of kids (for a diaper change, going in to grab water, trying to attend to my dogs or cats, or whatever) then I sometimes come back to find that a neighbor kid has pulled out my hose and made a mud puddle or broken something. It&#39;s like if I haven&#39;t specifically forbade something (you know, made a rule) then they figure it is fair game. Sometimes I just want to hang out with my own kids during the daytime, and enjoy my own yard with my own kids alone; but my son escalates into full blown crying if I try to say his friends can&#39;t play with him right now. I feel so trapped and powerless. I&#39;d like to spend time with my husband, but when he&#39;s home, we are often split between him playing with a crowd of kids (including some of ours) in the front or in the street, and me trying to prep food or take care of another kid in the house. Sometimes I&#39;m bitter when imagining the other parents getting to enjoy quiet, kid-free days at their homes while I&#39;m treated like their daycare (without the benefit of income or other parent provided snacks.) I am not saying that I want a kid free home myself, but I just want it to be friend-free more often. I know my home is fun and attractive to kids in the neighborhood, and I know that some day I will be so grateful that my kids are here and not off somewhere else. But right now I&#39;m feeling taken advantage of and I can&#39;t see a way out. My friend in another state suggested that we tell all of the other kids&#39; parents that we want one or two specific days to be alone with our kids and to not have their kids come over. I thought that was a good idea, but the more I thought about it, I figured it won&#39;t work. All of our households live so close it wouldn&#39;t matter what we told the parents of those older kids. On the sunny days the parents would just tell their kids to go outside to play, and then my kids would just see the other kids playing in the street (or other yards) and would want to go outside to play with them too...no matter what we had planned. My kids are so young too, that they stop listening (and often walk away) if I try to explain. It is also impossible to talk when it escalates to crying and screaming.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI cracked this evening when we came home from an outing to find 2 of the friends out waiting for us. My husband sighed at the sight of them, and I said I&#39;d tell them to go home. Which I did, but they didn&#39;t go. And my 6 yr old started crying and saying he wanted to play with his friends (even though we had all talked about other evening plans on our way home.)Then another, and other kid showed up. And I was about to be the crazy crying lady on the driveway. So I had to run to the bathroom, shut the door, scream at the top of my lungs, and cry by myself...and let my husband go hang out with the crowd again. I was sobbing, and imagining yelling at them to all get the f- off my property, and almost convincing myself that we have to move. To somewhere with land. <br/>\nAnd no friends. <br/>\nCrazy, I know.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving vented all this, I know logically that it is not worth the relationship to make Evan feel bad and have him cry when he simply wants to go play with his friends. And I try to tell myself all the time that it is all about my attitude and I should be present and have fun no matter what. But I&#39;m tired of being present for so many kids, kids who are parented differently, and who pass along so much school type social stuff that my husband and I then have to deal with, and help our kids navigate through. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ve tried things like putting a sign on the door that says, &quot;Do not knock&quot; or closing my curtains when I see the kids in the street (before my kids see them,) to try to buy myself a little more alone time with them. But it feels kinda sneaky, and then I&#39;m also back to wishing I could go outside and enjoy the sun and not be trapped inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;ve typed a bunch. At least my husband was awesome to take care of everything so I could take a time out and write this.
