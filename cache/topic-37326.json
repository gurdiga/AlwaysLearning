I always thought it was a blue screen, not green.<br/>\nDonny Osmond is a very good sport, in my opinion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWc6QQ9JlMc&feature=related\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWc6QQ9JlMc&feature=related</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis was hilarious.  I have seen Weird Al more times than I can count at the<br/>\nOrange County Fair.  He really is amazing.  I will show this video to Drew<br/>\nwhen he wakes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw Donny Osmond in concert when I was about 10 at the Southern California<br/>\nGirl Scout Diamond Jubilee Roundup at Glen Helen.
