I was worried that the friendship was headed for a fall and that would have been a big loss for my son.</div><div><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">One day, after this had been going on for awhile, I was driving the boys back from football practice and the friend said &quot;I don&#39;t know why adults get so worried about video games. &nbsp;I learn so much from video games! &nbsp;I learn about maps, geography, airplanes... so many different things.&quot; &nbsp;I said &quot;I totally agree. &nbsp;My kids learn tons from video games.&quot; &nbsp;The kid&#39;s mouth literally fell open and he sat in stunned silence for a few seconds. &nbsp;He then exclaimed &quot;Oh my God! &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe it! &nbsp;You are the first adult to ever understand!!&quot;</span></div><div><br></div><div>After that I noticed that the way he treated Jade and I started to change. &nbsp;He looked at us and our environment differently and he started to open his mind to the idea that maybe not all girls and adults suck! &nbsp;His resistance to us quickly dropped away and now the boys will actually invite Jade to do things like play Dungeons and Dragons, be part of their xbox band or &quot;Just Dance&quot; together, ride bikes with them. &nbsp;This boy&#39;s home life is often unstable and now he really seems to understand and appreciate the value of having us be here for him and often his little brother. &nbsp;He is nothing but respectful and helpful.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes the boys like to make cardboard buildings and burn them down with flaming cottonballs tossed from a miniature trebuchet my son and I made. &nbsp;Fortunately we are able to accommodate activities like that. &nbsp;One day they wanted to do this and the friend said &quot;think of all the great stuff we&#39;ll be learning! &nbsp;We&#39;ll be learning about physics, fire safety...&quot; I responded &quot;that line of reasoning will always work with me. &nbsp;Let&#39;s just make sure you do it safely.&quot; &nbsp;The smile on those boys faces - makes my heart want to burst just thinking about it.</div><div><br></div><div>-Cass</div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-1193192672 .ygrps-yiv-1193192672ExternalClass

is very cool Erin [😊] We had a similar experience - Kai was holding my phone for me on the way to a friends house (our first visit) and told me I&#39;d missed a turn, and navigated us back on track  - he was very pleased with himself back then! Now he&#39;s always my map reader!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHe also learnt from maps in video games - pretty much every game has a map, and with things like Minecraft there are even mods that allow you to mark waypoints and navigate home - which is super cool..\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe only time we get paper maps is usually at the zoo or animal sanctuary these days, but he can read a paper map just fine too!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJo\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________\r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; on behalf of Erin Waterbury <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:erinwaterbury@...\">erinwaterbury@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSent: 01 May 2016 19:01\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Seeing learning\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have a fun moment of seeing learning to share from yesterday.

Thank you for sharing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough we had some kids’ books that involved maps, I know the video game guides that had diagrams of the games helped my kids understand maps, for sure.  <br/>\nThat was “the olden days,” though.  Kids tend not to use paper game guides.  So the newer version is knowing how to use a smartphone! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning on CBS Sunday morning there was a fatoid put on the screen, that according to the most recent U.S. census, there are more Millenials alive now than Baby Boomers.  So Kirby and Marty and other 80’s-born people are outnumbering the post-WWII babies now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was born in 1953.  Many people my age waited a while to have children, and there was a kind of baby-having craze (here, in the U.S., anyway) in the 1980’s, it seemed, among all childbearing ages.  Baby boomers are starting to fade out now.  So the learning we saw in that big batch of kids was very cool, and surpriseing, but it’s not like the iPad and phone using younger children now,.  They might never know how to use a dictionary or encyclopedia—those will be as quaint as an old manual typewriter is—but they can fly through the internet like happy birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":470923233,"authorName":"Erin Waterbury","from":"Erin Waterbury &lt;erinwaterbury@...&gt;","profile":"pjsmomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Seeing learning","postDate":"1462125693","msgId":77049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTk1qNFl0K2hlak9HemFYQXJCQmthUGJjQ0FBNytxRWlBUEJ0OTkzaGJYNXlVUHZBd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77050,"prevInTime":77048,"nextInTime":77050,"topicId":77049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a fun moment of seeing learning to share from yesterday.
