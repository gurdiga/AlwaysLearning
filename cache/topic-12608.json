I will miss him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls and I were up nearHollywood today on an errand and stopped by <br/>\nhis star.  There was a huge flower arrangement from the Mayor and a <br/>\nballoon arrangement from someone else, a few candles, etc.  Someone had <br/>\nput a little stuffed kitty in a sweater and a blue sweater by the star, <br/>\nand there were a few notes.  Lexie and Janene wanted to leave something <br/>\ntoo so we went back to our car and found a little finger puppet.  I put <br/>\nit on top of the flower arrangement, on the upper most unopened flower. <br/>\nLexie and Janene wrote notes on 5x7 notecards and I wish I would have <br/>\nhad my camera.  I watched him as a child, on a very small black and <br/>\nwhite tv, and he was important to me.  I always felt like he was telling <br/>\nme *I* was special, that *I* was important, and I always wanted to meet <br/>\nhim.  Sadly that will never happen now.  I had a very difficult <br/>\nchildhood with friends, who often told me how much I didn&#39;t fit in, and <br/>\nMr. Rogers counteracted that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; An interesting thing I noticed about explaining everything was in a Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Rogers<br/>\n&gt; book about moving.

When we had foster kids and were moving, one day I heard a <br/>\nbunch of noice in their room.  I went in and they were destroying the <br/>\nold dresser I had for them, one I had had as a child.  I had repainted <br/>\nit for the kids and they had broken one drawer and were starting on the <br/>\nnext.  I stopped them and asked what they were doing.  They answered <br/>\nmatter-of-factly that we weren&#39;t going to get our money back so they <br/>\nmight as well destroy everything.  They were only five and six, but I <br/>\nguess living in furnished apartments and foster homes had made an <br/>\nimpression.

He has been around much longer than Sesame Street.  <br/>\nMany of us have invited Mr Rogers, with his positive songs delivered <br/>\nin his gentle voice, and his neighborhood of kindly friends, into our <br/>\nhomes every day since early childhood.  His show was basically so <br/>\ngreat, that it remained virtually unchanged throughout it&#39;s <br/>\nexistance, without every suffering in populatrity.  A true piece of <br/>\nAmericana is the segment in the beginning of his show where he <br/>\ncomes &quot;home&quot; to the living room of the set, and changes into his <br/>\ntrademark red cardigan and canvas sneakers while singing his show&#39;s <br/>\ntheme song &quot;It&#39;s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.&quot;  All in one <br/>\nsegment he has charmed us with flattery and asked to be friends, made <br/>\nhimself an accessible and human adult (by changing shoes and sweater) <br/>\nand displayed a sense of fun in how he does it.  It&#39;s classic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom misterrogers.org<br/>\n<br/>\nFred McFeely Rogers (1928-2003)<br/>\nWe are very sorry to deliver the sad news that Fred Rogers died on <br/>\nFebruary 27, 2003 after a brief battle with stomach cancer. We are <br/>\ngrateful for the many people, young and old, who have cared about his <br/>\nwork over the years and who continue to appreciate Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>\nNeighborhood on PBS. We hope that you&#39;ll join us in celebrating his <br/>\nlife by reflecting on his messages and taking them into your everyday <br/>\nlives. <br/>\n <br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an educator, songwriter, puppeteer, producer, and children&#39;s <br/>\ntelevision programming pioneer, Fred Rogers has entertained and <br/>\neducated children for nearly 50 years. Seen daily on public <br/>\ntelevision stations across the country, the Mister Rogers&#39; <br/>\nNeighborhood series, with its unique approach to helping young <br/>\nchildren learn about themselves and their world, has been recognized <br/>\nby educators and early childhood professionals and confirmed by early <br/>\nbrain research. As the longest running program on public television, <br/>\nthe Neighborhood series is more important for today&#39;s children than <br/>\never before. <br/>\n<br/>\nLyrics to Theme Song for Mr. Rogers Neighborhood<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a beautiful day in this neighborhood,<br/>\nA beautiful day for a neighbor.<br/>\nWould you be mine?<br/>\nCould you be mine?...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a neighborly day in this beauty wood,<br/>\nA neighborly day for a beauty.<br/>\nWould you be mine?<br/>\nCould you be mine?...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let&#39;s make the most of this beautiful day.<br/>\nSince we&#39;re together we might as well say:<br/>\nWould you be mine?<br/>\nCould you be mine?<br/>\nWon&#39;t you be my neighbor?<br/>\nWon&#39;t you please,<br/>\nWon&#39;t you please?<br/>\nPlease won&#39;t you be my neighbor?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Mr. Rogers","postDate":"1046388577","msgId":12633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMy4zZGVmYmYxLjJiOGZmOTYxQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12631,"nextInTopic":12638,"prevInTime":12632,"nextInTime":12634,"topicId":12608,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/27/03 3:49:53 PM Central Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes:  Oh, but you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-125357715\">In a message dated 2/27/03 3:49:53 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Shyrley who sometimes feels like an alien &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, but you are my dear, you are.<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m an alien, I&#39;m a legal alien, I&#39;m an Englishman in New York.....&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
