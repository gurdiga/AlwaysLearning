So it’s not “Deb Lewis writing” in the best sense, but when I put it on the page where it will live, I will link to my Deb Lewis collection for sure. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you will probably see right away which page of mine this is destined for.  Maybe (I’m thinking) I will build links into the code of that page and then hotlink the heck out of this:<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled with your request for this intro. It&#39;s been a real battle.  Left to my own devices, I wouldn&#39;t have catered to your every whim. I&#39;m not some version of a short order cook, after all. I shouldn&#39;t have to be at your beck and call. I&#39;m not your slave. I don&#39;t owe you anything. The world doesn&#39;t revolve around you. It&#39;s like you want everything handed to you on a silver platter. As if you have to be waited on hand and foot. Well, I suppose there’s no sense in throwing a fit. I&#39;ll finish what I started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd about your readers, they&#39;re glued to their screens, taking the easy way out. They&#39;ve turned into zombies. You could talk until you&#39;re blue in the face, but you&#39;ll never be able to do enough. If you give them an inch, they&#39;ll take a mile. They are manipulative, and you need to teach them you are not their puppet. You might have to resort to bribery to get them to stop fussing and fighting. They&#39;ve seriously got the gimmes. You could literally stuff good information down their throats, and they&#39;d still be bouncing off the walls, all hyped up. You could leave them to fend for themselves but then they&#39;d be at each other&#39;s throats. They really feel if mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will spoil your appetite for helping others, but it serves you right. I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end. Whatever. You do you. Just remember, all things in moderation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n__________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSo fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78487,"nextTopicId":78488}}
