I can&#39;t help thinking it will<br/>\ndamage their internal motivation, and their already<br/>\ngreat love of books and stories. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like this kind of program either.

(I think the original study was done with kids painting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I believe that when doing animal conditioning for a reward the whole thing only works if the animals are underfed.  As we know, bribing kids with candy and Nintendo time only works when those items are kept in pretty short supply.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Logging their reading without commenting to them and surprising them with the treat would work for me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22382,"nextTopicId":22338}}
