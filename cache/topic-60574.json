My daughter (Anna) loves it so much that she went<br/>\nthrough a period of carrying it around with her. She read it when she was<br/>\n14yo, and it&#39;s still in her stack of favorite books that she keeps by the<br/>\nside of her bed. I bought our used copy through Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna also liked the Teenage Liberation Handbook, but I think the Kendall<br/>\nHailey book was more inspiring for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlake Boles&#39; book would be a good one to share with a skeptical spouse -<br/>\nit&#39;s very logistical and (I think) written for someone new to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Cara B<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Apr 10, 2011 at 1:09 PM, sheeboo2 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brmino@...\">brmino@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A dear friend is considering unschooling her soon-to-be in high school<br/>\n&gt; daughter.
