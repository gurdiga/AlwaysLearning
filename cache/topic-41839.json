But that&#39;s another tirade entirely.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband comes from big families. He&#39;s one of three, his mom is one of<br/>\nnine, his dad one of three, but grandpa one of like 11 or 12 or something.<br/>\nDysfunction junction every way you look.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parenting mentor/guru, the person to whom I look whenever I&#39;m really<br/>\ndesperate about something, has 10 children. Because she and her husband<br/>\nreally, really like them. Her oldest two are boys, 26 and 24, married women<br/>\nthat my pal adores, girls who both came back to her house for college<br/>\nbreaks, rather than their own homes, and the two boys bought houses on the<br/>\nsame street as each other, so they could raise their families together. I<br/>\nfigure anyone who can pull that off is someone I want to emulate. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI now have three children. I only was planning on one. Then he was, frankly,<br/>\nincredible, and my husband and I said... let&#39;s do that again! And had #2,<br/>\nwho is an amazing person. And we were going to stop there, but then I<br/>\nconceived, and miscarried, and that was so gutwrenching, that I knew that #3<br/>\nwas a good idea. And now she&#39;s here too, and the dynamic with three kids is<br/>\njust awesome. It&#39;s like she&#39;s the salt in the dish the other two made, that<br/>\nevens everything out and unifies it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving three kids in the SF Bay Area of CA sucks. I get looks and comments<br/>\npretty much every time we venture out in public. You know, cause three is<br/>\nsooooooo extravagant and we are being soooooo wasteful of resources. Never<br/>\nmind that because of thrift, hand me downs, and homebirth, baby #3 cost<br/>\nbasically nothing. Never mind that we live on a boat and use approximately<br/>\none eight of the resources we did to run a house on land with one fewer<br/>\nperson. People will judge, and it&#39;s been my experience so far that they<br/>\njudge on their own preconceptions, and not on the evidence before them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s OK; we had our family because *we* wanted to, because we wanted<br/>\nto share the joy that we could create amongst ourselves, not because we were<br/>\nlooking to garner the approval of some of the most child-hostile people on<br/>\nthe planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, it&#39;s hypocritical of me to judge the Octuplet mom. OTOH,<br/>\nknowing what I know about the energy needs of just three kids with three<br/>\nyears between them, I have no clue how a single human being could possibly<br/>\nhope to really raise them. If she&#39;s got answers, I&#39;d love to hear them.
