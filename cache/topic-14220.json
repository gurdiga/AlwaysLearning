Or shrooms. <br/>\nTried pot once after college and almost choked on the smoke. And I went to a <br/>\nhippy college where there were plenty of drugs. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Junior high I even tried to start an anti-drug group. Someone once <br/>\ndescribed me as being like &quot;Someone who&#39;d Lost a Friend to drugs.&quot; (This was <br/>\nnot said in a loving, compassionate tone.) My goodness, what a good girl I <br/>\nwas! <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who <br/>\nknew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the <br/>\nresults of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. Everytime I <br/>\nsee one of them I just want to offer my kid a joint.<br/>\n<br/>\n(No, not really, in case you managed to miss that I&#39;m kidding. Put the phone <br/>\ndown. Calling Child Protective will really not help anything.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14212,"nextTopicId":14234}}
