Just yesterday, I was feeling restless, the house was cluttered, that kind of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-774574552\">I am getting better at the whole doing housework without feeling pissy thing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust yesterday, I was feeling restless, the house was cluttered, that kind of thing.  Turns out I was PMSy, but that&#39;s part of what makes the moment even sweeter for me, since when I&#39;m that way I&#39;m more likely to be cranky than gracious.  Earlier in the morning, I had casually mentioned to Andy that maybe he could neaten up his room. He told me he likes it messy.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had cleaned the living room, unloaded (and reloaded) the dishwasher, and started gathering socks and underwear to wash with the sheets.  Remembering that Andy had complained about having the wear the same socks &#39;every time&#39; I went into his room to look for socks.  His room was an explosion of stuff everywhere -- duct tape stuck to the carpet, apparently just for fun, clothes, toys and scraps of paper everywhere, and clearly -- from the smell -- it was time to put new litter in the mouse cage.  I sorted thru it all, filled a shopping bag with paper scraps and tape, emptied and replaced the mouse litter, put all the toys in a box, thru all the blankets on the beds.  As I was finishing up the mouse cage, Dan insisted on filling the water bottle, and did a great job with it (and he&#39;s only 3).  Andy came, saw it all, and said, &quot;You cleaned my room?&quot;  I answered that I had been looking for socks, needed to clear trash out of my way, and changed the mouse cage because the smell bothered<br/>\n me -- that it had never been a mission to clean his room, really just to find socks.  And, it really wasn&#39;t clean, just less cluttered and lighter by some trash.  Along the way, I found the missing nail clippers -- a bonus!<br/>\n <br/>\nSeveral minutes later, he came to me in the kitchen and invited me to see his room.  I was busy making lunch, but guessing where this was going, I asked what I&#39;d see if I went to his room.  With a grin, I asked if he&#39;d already messed it up again.  He said, &quot;Yes.  When my room is clean it&#39;s like I&#39;m in another dimension.  When I can see the floor, it&#39;s like a 4th dimension.&quot;  I laughed with him and said, &quot;Really? It&#39;s your room, you have it any way you like it.  I didn&#39;t clean it for you, or because I expect you to keep it clean.  I cleaned so I could find your socks for the laundry.&quot;  And it really was okay with me. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat was different this time?  Because in the past, I&#39;ve gone on about how other people could help me clean.  Yanno, the whole martying Mom thing.   As I started cleaning yesterday morning, I reminded myself of something I read about living peacefully with your kids.  I clean and do other needful things for me, because I want them done or I think they need to be done.  I&#39;m not doing all this for other people, and it&#39;s not fair to ask them to do it just to please me.  I&#39;ve invited these children into my life, to live in our home, not so that I could turn them into slave labor to keep my house clean.  It&#39;s also not part of my job to teach them how to keep house.  They&#39;ll figure out how they like things kept, watch me do it and choose to do it themselves, or not -- as they wish, not as I insist.  And it really is so much more pleasant to do things myself than to force others to do my bidding.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOkay, so now it sounds like rambling, but it was a really big moment for me.  I&#39;ve always been something of a control freak, so the living part of unschooling is often harder than giving up the schooly part.  It&#39;s just part of that natural progression from unschooling newbies still clinging to some pretense of control to the freedom of just living together.<br/>\nThis is nice!<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Everyone told me I&#39;d<br/>\nknow my baby in the first moment, that I&#39;d hold him and know him and how<br/>\nbonding and beautiful it would be.  But when he was born and we looked at<br/>\nhim here was a brand new person with his own mind, not a copy of me or<br/>\nhis dad.   That astounded me.  It seems so stupid now, but he was a<br/>\nstranger we needed to get to know and so we found ourselves asking<br/>\nquestions like &quot;what if he doesn&#39;t like that?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother moment was when my mother said she wished she&#39;d never hit any of<br/>\nher kids.  She said upon reflection she came to see that children respond<br/>\nto their environment and that when they&#39;re behaving in ways we don&#39;t like<br/>\nthere&#39;s always a reason, and a gentle, helpful solution, but mom&#39;s are<br/>\nsometimes too stressed or busy to notice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had decided before Dylan was born that we&#39;d never spank him and that<br/>\nwe&#39;d listen to him and let him be himself.  In moments since then when<br/>\nhis dad had a hard time with the letting-him-be-himself philosophy he&#39;s<br/>\nsaid he was expecting Dylan&#39;s &quot;self&quot; to be more like his own. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I watched Dylan push a chair to the counter and climb for<br/>\na glass I knew he was some kind of super genius!&lt;g&gt;  That was the<br/>\nbeginning of wondering what all he&#39;d learn by living.   I still had a<br/>\nhard time not believing there was some magic in teaching that could<br/>\ndeliver the world to my kid at some future date, but that took care of<br/>\nitself in the moments I was really paying attention to what Dylan was<br/>\ndoing.   What our kids show us will push out our years of schooling but<br/>\nwe have to let it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we started with the beginning foundation of unschooling, and when<br/>\nDylan said he didn&#39;t want to go to school it was easy for us to listen to<br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam Hartley wrote that having the opportunity to take care of our<br/>\nfamily&#39;s needs (cooking, housework) was our gift to them.  That was<br/>\nanother moment of enlightenment for me, that I had made these choices,<br/>\nhusband, home, stuff, child and that all those things made my life<br/>\nbetter.  I got rid of the things I was resenting.  I tore out the carpet<br/>\nI was having to wash too frequently because of critter accidents and was<br/>\namazed that a mess or spill wiped up quickly, no stains, no worries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra changed things for my husband.  She wrote about treating our kids<br/>\nthe way we wish we&#39;d been treated.  It wasn&#39;t easy for David to admit his<br/>\nparents might have done better, he felt ungrateful and disloyal.  But<br/>\ngiving his son what he never got emotionally has been a healing thing for<br/>\nhim.  It eased a lot of personal anguish and it&#39;s given Dylan a loving,<br/>\ninvolved dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are people who can&#39;t unschool.  They are the folks who are<br/>\nunwilling to rethink everything they thought they knew.  They are afraid<br/>\nor unwilling to give up control.  And they are convinced kids aren&#39;t good<br/>\nor smart or capable until an adult makes them so.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling parents need to be willing to honor their child&#39;s<br/>\nindividuality.  That&#39;s hard to do if all you want is for your kid to fit<br/>\nin and make you look good.   It&#39;s hard to do because then you have some<br/>\nethical obligation to meet that individuals needs.  That individual might<br/>\nwant or need something you wouldn&#39;t have chosen for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve heard &quot;I unschool, I don&#39;t un parent!&quot; <br/>\nwhen the conversation has turned from kids having control of their<br/>\nlearning to kids having control of their lives.  A parent&#39;s comfort with<br/>\nand ability to see life and learning as the same thing is essential to<br/>\nunschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hiding in there, in that unwillingness to give kids control, is the<br/>\nfear that children allowed their individuality will walk all over their<br/>\nparents.  There&#39;s big, weird psychology in the idea that our own little<br/>\nchildren will grind us into dirt given half a chance.

I think sometimes (maybe pretty often?) schoolers/homeschoolers get to the concept that kids/people learn best when they are interested in something and that initially brings them to unschooling.  As beginning unschoolers they are looking for &quot;rules&quot; or at least definitive guidelines &lt;g&gt;, to make unschooling successful for them.  Akin to the &quot;rules&quot; of school or school-at-home.  They want to trade out the rules that aren&#39;t working for them for a set they believe will work better.

Because I dream big I would <br/>\nlike to think that unschooling can be a reality for everyone <br/>\nespecially if more unschooling communities develop instead of <br/>\nschools to cover where home unschooling is impractical. But you all <br/>\nhave probably figured that out about me already :) so what I would <br/>\nlike to add to this discussion is that unschooling will be much <br/>\neasier to talk with people about when there is even more written and <br/>\ndiscussed on the subject, the more people are &quot;subjected&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;exposed&quot; to new ideas the more the ideas become real or probable <br/>\nto them. Just as homeschooling is a bit easier today that it was 20 <br/>\nyears ago because more people are doing it and more has been written <br/>\nand &quot;media&quot; -ed about it so we could hopefully conclude that the <br/>\nmore people know about unschooling then the more people will be <br/>\nwilling to accept it.<br/>\nI am so definately new to unschooling because as I read one of the <br/>\nearlier posts on this topic it poped out at me why the &quot;newbies&quot; to <br/>\nunschooling say something like &quot;their child stopped watching TV <br/>\ntoday and actually spent some time reading&quot; meaning that perhaps <br/>\nthey thought the only activity of value to their child for the day <br/>\nwas the reading, that they didn&#39;t place the same value on TV viewing <br/>\nas they did reading. I think unschoolers believe that ANY activity <br/>\nthe child wishes to do of their own occord should have value - that <br/>\nmore value shouldn&#39;t be placed on one activity than another. <br/>\nSo that is where I am - my ds is doing activities that matter to him <br/>\nand he is definately developing even more of his sturdiness as I <br/>\nlike to call it. OK not that &quot;Mom - I&#39;m busy&quot; or when I&#39;m explaining <br/>\nsomething he ask about that he usually abruptly stops me the second <br/>\nhe &quot;gets it&quot; and usually stops me mid-sentence with a &quot;Stop - I <br/>\nunderstand&quot; or &quot;Yeah, I know&quot; or the RARE &quot;OK - Thanks&quot; then walks <br/>\nimmediately off, LOL! So what I have learned so far from this <br/>\nbeginning &quot;level&quot; is that being an unschooling student&#39;s mom is not <br/>\nall happy and hugs (although we have those times also) but that you <br/>\nbest have some tough skin and somekind of activity or hobby to keep <br/>\nyourself busy when your children don&#39;t need your attentions, because <br/>\nit&#39;s not as if you have to entertain or be &quot;teacher&quot; to your child <br/>\nas much as perhaps just be there for them when they need you.

On the one <br/>\nhand you could easily say, &quot;Oh, unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone,&quot; and on some level <br/>\nyou&#39;d be right. But I think that -- in theory -- unschooling could work for anyone/<br/>\neveryone, but only if they really throw themselves into the mindset wholeheartedly <br/>\nand give it a real chance to take root. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s tempting to say that unschooling is only for certain types of people because then <br/>\nwe can be the rebels, the mavericks who are blazing a bitchin&#39; new trail. It&#39;s scary to <br/>\nmost people to imagine a world with no schools. Would society fall apart? Or would it <br/>\nbe better? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for some family to say, &quot;We tried it and it didn&#39;t work.&quot; What does &quot;tried&quot; <br/>\nmean? That you took your kids out of school for three months and when they weren&#39;t <br/>\nwinning spelling bees or solving quadratic equations but rather were watching TV, <br/>\nplaying video games or surfing the web you decided the experiment was a failure?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does &quot;work&quot; mean? (Not to get too Clinton-ish with defining simple words, lol.) <br/>\nFor one family it might mean the difference between discord and harmony, the <br/>\ndifference between having an antagonistic mistrustful relationship with kids you <br/>\nhardly ever see and having a close relationship with kids you are really proud of. That <br/>\ncould be considered &quot;working&quot; in some families. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other families it&#39;s not working unless the child is performing light years ahead of <br/>\ngrade level, or demonstrating a clear trajectory that will land them in a certain field, <br/>\nbe it medicine, law, aeronautics, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, there are no people in the world I would rather spend time with than my <br/>\nhusband and daughter. The thought of saying goodbye to her for 13 years except for <br/>\na few hurried stressful moments in the morning and a few moments (probably spent <br/>\nnagging about homework) in the evening is repugnant to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think back on what I learned in school and even though I&#39;m only 31, I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember much that was good or useful. I can&#39;t add or subtract easily in my head, <br/>\nand forget about higher math. I couldn&#39;t tell you squat about history besides what I&#39;ve <br/>\nread as an adult. I don&#39;t remember diddly about the periodic table or any of the laws <br/>\nof physics that were drilled into my head. I only remember what interested me: books <br/>\nand authors, grammar, poetry, art, music, biology. And I went to a private school! <br/>\nImagine the amazing unschooling experiences I could have had for $15K per year for <br/>\n13 years! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I DO I remember is countless moments of frustration and humiliation, at the <br/>\nhands of my teachers and especially my peers. Why on earth would I subject my <br/>\ndaughter to that? It would probably be worse for her, since I can&#39;t afford to send her <br/>\nto private school. Plus she is spirited and sensitive and stubborn, three things that <br/>\nwon&#39;t help her in the school environment. I was already so thoroughly &quot;broken&quot; by my <br/>\ndistastrous home environment that I hadn&#39;t any spark left to rock the boat at all, so I <br/>\njust went with the program meekly. I can&#39;t see dd being that resigned and self-<br/>\nnegating. I certainly don&#39;t plan to break my daughter&#39;s spirit, and I&#39;m not about to <br/>\nstand by and let it happen in a school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care what she decides to do with her life. It&#39;s her life. All I want for her is to <br/>\nenjoy her childhood, something many children don&#39;t get to do. When she is older, I <br/>\nwant her to be able to pursue what she is interested in, whatever that may turn out to <br/>\nbe. I won&#39;t judge. And when she is an adult, I don&#39;t want her to be suddenly thrust out <br/>\ninto the world with no idea of how it really works, or to be trapped in a McJob, <br/>\ndeferring her happiness until retirement. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that most people who unschool are giving their children an amazing gift: the <br/>\ngift of being able to be a child. There is no rush. All that needs to be learned will be <br/>\nlearned, each thing in it&#39;s own time, in a natural way. There is also plenty of time for <br/>\nlearning what the real world is like, how to navigate the world safely, how to handle <br/>\nmoney, how to deal with different types of people and situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that parents who unschool are also showing their children, &quot;You are worth it,&quot; <br/>\nby choosing (for example) to be a single income family and doing without certain <br/>\nthings to make unschooling possible, by choosing to be with them day in and day out, <br/>\nby strewing their paths with interesting experiences and listening to them whenever <br/>\nthey want to talk, whatever they want to say, without judging or belittling. If children <br/>\nare raised to feel they deserve a good, fulfilling life, they are not going to be content <br/>\nin a McJob. They most likely will not get trapped in a toxic relationship, romatic or <br/>\nplatonic. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion it is 99% guaranteed to work if you really pratice true unschooling. But <br/>\nto bring up Yoda again, you can&#39;t just &quot;try&quot; you have to &quot;do.&quot; Please all of you keep in <br/>\nmind that everything I wrote above is just my opinion. My dd is only 8 months old so I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say conclusively, &quot;unschooling worked for me.&quot; However I promise to keep you <br/>\nall posted on whether I was right or not!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the real question/newness (if any) is in the middle","postDate":"1075162705","msgId":18470,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTI2LjE2MTgyNS4xNTQwLjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18469,"nextInTopic":18472,"prevInTime":18469,"nextInTime":18471,"topicId":18464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Mon, 26 Jan 2004 15:06:03 -0800 Pam Hartley ...

And glad I finally got your whole post. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI hope we can discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going to post something last week on some what of the same subject,<br/>\nbut never did.  I&#39;m glad it was you that started it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think there are some sort of levels in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we can call it beginner, intermediate or advanced.  Of course<br/>\nyou can&#39;t<br/>\nput labels on it that way.  (I know Kelly was joking around earlier when she<br/>\nreferred to the list that way,  but we know what she means.)   There are<br/>\ndifferent levels of<br/>\nawareness in it.  Maybe its how far a person wants it to permiate into their<br/>\nlife.  But yet that&#39;s when we start getting into trouble.  &lt;g&gt;  Because<br/>\nisn&#39;t unschooling living your life,  so isn&#39;t it going to encompass it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat hit me and what got me thinking last week was a simple statement from<br/>\nsomeone on one of the lists,  something like, &quot;they are finally off the<br/>\nPlaystation&quot;  or equally &quot;they are finally doing something other than video<br/>\ngames&quot;.   These types of statements now jump out at me.   When I first<br/>\nstarted unschooling,  I&#39;m sure I would have said the same thing and not<br/>\nblinked twice at the statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as I read something like that,  it really bothers me.   I don&#39;t always<br/>\nrespond to comments like these because people aren&#39;t always ready to hear<br/>\nthe criticism.  Which could be good or bad of me,  in helping them<br/>\nunderstand unschooling.   I want to say something to the effect of &quot;so what<br/>\nif they are still playing video games?&quot;     Isn&#39;t a big part of<br/>\nunschooling,  accepting where our children are?   My child might end up<br/>\ndesigning games, programming, testing games,  what-ever.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that a good place to be in?      I think so.<br/>\nI think that is the beauty of unschooling.   But I&#39;m at that point.  I see<br/>\nthe sense in it.  Its crystal clear to me,  now.  It wasn&#39;t at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of questioning could be applied to all sorts of topics,  we&#39;ve all<br/>\nseen them,  from chores to going to church.   Doesn&#39;t it just permeate into<br/>\nall parts of our lives if we practice respectful parenting?   With my family<br/>\nwe first started homeschooling in an ecletic type style,  then went to<br/>\nunschooling,  then the unschooling went into practically every crevice of<br/>\nour lives.   It was the whole snowball effect. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then it goes back to where the parent is in that awareness.   Also maybe<br/>\nwhat the objective of the parent is.   If a person is caught up in a child<br/>\nlearning certain things,  its pretty hard to be ok with what the child wants<br/>\nnow.   If a person&#39;s objective is the child&#39;s happiness,  well, then I think<br/>\nits alot easier to foster the unschooling environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it depends alot on where the parent&#39;s mindset is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it depends on the level of acceptance they are at. Acceptance of their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s choices and also acceptance of what other people have to say if<br/>\none is discussing unschooling.    I guess my mind goes to people who come to<br/>\ndiscussions looking for resurrance or that they are doing things OK.   Like<br/>\nwith the whole restrictions thing.    In a different place they might get<br/>\nthe pat on the back,  here or other places you&#39;re going to be questioned on<br/>\nit.   At that point I think is where a person can either open up their mind<br/>\nand think through what they are doing.   Or they can shut down and say, &quot;<br/>\nno,  that doesn&#39;t/won&#39;t work&quot;.   Possibly getting defensive and all that.<br/>\nThat might be where a person either stops at one level or goes on to the<br/>\nnext.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it comes down to how far an individual lets unschooling go.  Does it<br/>\nencompass your whole life or does it stop with the learning;   but wouldn&#39;t<br/>\na true unschooler say the learning never stops so why would the unschooling?<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n~who is not saying she is at the top level &lt;g&gt;  just making some<br/>\nobservations that have been jumping around in my brain the last few weeks~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the real question/newness (if any) is in the middle","postDate":"1075152672","msgId":18465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwMTU4NzIwLjUwOTAzMDlAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE4MC4yNTE1ODIwYi4yZDQ2OWUzN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18464,"nextInTopic":18466,"prevInTime":18464,"nextInTime":18466,"topicId":18464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I m not a soccer player; some of you are or have been or could be. ** Dancing in and out of your analogy: I m way to heavy to be a good soccer player, but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1976667044\">**I&#39;m not a soccer player; some of you are or have been or could be. **<br/>\n<br/>\nDancing in and out of your analogy:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m way to heavy to be a good soccer player, but sometimes I do play <br/>\nsoccer with the moms and kids at our park day on Tuesday.

Does someone else saying you can <br/>\nmake you able to?  No.  Does someone else saying you can&#39;t prevent you?  No.  <br/>\nWhat will enable a person to do ANYthing?  Talent, interest, ability, desire, <br/>\naction—things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a soccer player; some of you are or have been or could be.  Some of <br/>\nyou play no musical instruments while I do; some of you could, some have too <br/>\nlittle talent, interest and desire in that area.  Cooking, engine tune-up, lens <br/>\ngrinding, geological prospecting, oil painting… some we do, some we don&#39;t, <br/>\nsome could, some couldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when and if people come to an unschooling source or resource, does <br/>\ntouching the book or joining the group guarantee understanding or success? <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I wrote when I woke up:<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone can&#39;t handle real questions about their own thoughts, unschooling <br/>\nwill not come easily.  If others asking &quot;WHY do you think what you say you <br/>\nbelieve?&quot; makes them so angry that they slam away muttering, how will they handle <br/>\nthe simpler questions of friends, neighbors, and grocery store clerks?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout examining our own past learning, our fears and the times and ways we <br/>\nhave shut out input and feedback,, the conscious direction of our thoughts <br/>\nwon&#39;t be easy.   Unschoolers need to come to the point that they can face their <br/>\npast so that they can make peace with it, and pass the peace on to their <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s favorite parts of movies tends to be the &quot;training scenes&quot; of <br/>\nheroes and avengers.   From old Hong Kong kick flicks through Star Wars, Zorro, <br/>\nBuffy and the Matrix,, there are people carrying water, walking on rice paper, <br/>\ncatching flies with chopsticks, lifting, sensing, enduring and growing strong <br/>\nand calm.  He helped me gain an appreciation for that traditional glimpse <br/>\ninto what makes the change in a person&#39;s outlook and skills.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople new to unschooling are easily unbalanced with a question like &quot;Why?&quot; <br/>\nor &#39;How do you propose to do that?&quot;   We can help them find that balance, but <br/>\nit has to be their own real balance and knowledge, not them parroting our <br/>\nwords.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool calls test scores &quot;knowing.&quot;  If we &quot;knew&quot; everything we had ever spat <br/>\nback out on a ten-question Friday quiz, school would be the most successful <br/>\nthing in the history of the world.    I have a piece of paper that says I <br/>\n&quot;know&quot; Middle English, and for a phrase or two I might, but what I did was to keep <br/>\nin the 80% range of cooperation and performance for four months one time as a <br/>\nteacher presented information about Middle English.   What I do know, I <br/>\nlearned by caring about it, and following it up in the years to follow.   Some <br/>\npeople think they know geometry or the history of Rome, but if they look at what <br/>\nthey know it will probably be divided into what someone else said they knew and <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve learned from their own curiosity and fascination.  If all they <br/>\nhave is what they repeated back on tests in school, they will know less than <br/>\nthey could.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn learning to unschool, what people learn to speak back on Friday is too <br/>\nsmall to count.  What they do &quot;in the field,&quot; with their own real children, in <br/>\nreal time, on difficult mornings, on feverish evenings, on boring afternoons or <br/>\ndays filled with bickering is the hard part.  The unbalancing, frightening <br/>\ntimes when they feel alone are when they do or do not.  We can play Yoda on lists <br/>\nlike this, but we can&#39;t lift your child out of the mire of school.  You have <br/>\nto believe that you can do it, and then you have to maintain your resolve and <br/>\nyour balance and your focus for years.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it could be an article, or maybe it&#39;s just me muttering to myself to <br/>\nimprove my own thinking.<br/>\nProbably it would be better as a discussion here.  Someone lately said this <br/>\nwas an advanced unschooling list. &lt;g&gt;  I know there are beginning unschoolers <br/>\nhere too, and that&#39;s fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI read something last night that Kelly Lovejoy is writing about stages of <br/>\nunschooling, and maybe I dreamed about it, and woke up with a thought like a <br/>\nsticker.  Some people don&#39;t want to hear that there are higher levels of <br/>\nunschooling thought.  People have been &quot;shushing&quot; such ideas for years, and I had some <br/>\nurge to shush Kelly last night.  Some people&#39;s first move is to be angry that <br/>\nanyone else thinks they know more about unschooling than others.  I get harsh <br/>\ninsults every few weeks by people who show up cocky and overconfident and <br/>\nclueless and unbalanced (one way or another).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the answer is for those who have been helping others to stop <br/>\ndoing that.   I don&#39;t think the answer is for us to deny for all time even to <br/>\neach other that there ARE beginning levels and more advanced levels.  Joyce <br/>\nFetteroll said something on UnschoolingDiscussion last month about something being <br/>\ntoo difficult for beginners (which might be what inspired Kelly&#39;s upcoming <br/>\narticle, or not) and my first response was fear and then laughter (I kept it <br/>\nprivate).  She was right, it was just the idea that she WROTE it and put it out <br/>\nin public.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we need to bury that idea again or can we safely discuss it?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18662,"nextTopicId":18666}}
