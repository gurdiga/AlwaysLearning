Some schools are more like that than others.  Some people pay extra to have their kids in schools that are MORE like that.  You are doing it for less, I imagine.  Perhaps that should be the talking point... what is and is not school and how it should look at home.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help I don&#39;t  understand Unschooling!","postDate":"1265052427","msgId":50368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzMjVCREU0LTRBNkEtNEExOC1BRTlDLUMwRDE3MDUxNjg0OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhrNzg2NyszcXVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhrNzg2NyszcXVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50366,"nextInTopic":50389,"prevInTime":50367,"nextInTime":50369,"topicId":50366,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But I want to be sure they are learning what they need to be up to grade level. -=- There s your problem.
