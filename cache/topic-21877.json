I was reading by the age of 5 and reading adult books by 7 so was very concerned when my eldest ds by the age of 8 showed no reading skills at all. I had panicked when he was about 5 and started looking for methods to help him. I always got so stressed during these sessions and one day lost my temper with him. It ended in tears and me feeling like a monster, I asked him after we had talked it through if there was anything I could do to help and he said just leave me alone. 3 years on and nothing and I were hiding from any situation that meant family or friends would put him to the test. The other day we got down the old dos computer and I was looking at the old style WP programmes and typed up a sentence of 13 words and Axel with out hesitation read 10 of them and just needed a little help with sound to decipher the other 3. I was stunned; he can read but just does not want to read books at the moment. I am not saying anything to him; as if we mention it he goes sort of &quot;well what&#39;s the big deal&quot; sort of thing. I have been there to answer his questions when he has asked me what words say or what sounds they make and that is all since my fateful trying to push when he was 5. I hope this helps others as it is so good to see that what we believe is true is. Martin and I are so excited by this.<br/>\n<br/>\nJay and Family<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooled52\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooled52</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream</a><br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 266.7.1 - Release Date: 09/03/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21860,"nextTopicId":21878}}
