For example no country<br/>\ngets an explorer until the year that country actually did start exploring.<br/>\nSo Spain and Portugal are the only ones with explorers at the start.<br/>\nRob played Turkey and he said it was fascinating.  The downside for him<br/>\nwas that it was slow - he played a lot of hours and still had only gotten<br/>\nto the late 1500s! The second version of that game is out this fall too;<br/>\nmy older son wants it.

I am not putting anyone down if this is the way they believe I <br/>\njust am not sure what to call this sect.

To <br/>\nothers tv was ok but only videos. To many the internet was a sin. My daughter <br/>\nwas loved Twain then and we were told that his books should be burned. Once I <br/>\nwas standing there looking at a catalog of posters of Native Americans and a <br/>\nlady walked up and gave me a lecture on the &quot;dirty heathens.&quot; It was at this <br/>\ntime the kids and I decided that the pe classes were not worth it.

Some are more accepting of things than others. <br/>\nFI, if they don&#39;t do Halloween there, it&#39;s a big clue that they may have <br/>\nobjections to any mention of magic, sorcery, otherworldly beings (gnomes, <br/>\nfairies, etc.) and the like. This would leave out a lot of the magic-based <br/>\nfantasy games (including D&D and the collectable card games Magic, Legend of <br/>\nthe Five Rings and the new Harry Potter stuff). Some have objections to <br/>\nfantasy and imaginative stuff altogether. Some have objections to any <br/>\nwar-like content. Some object to the use of dice or cards in any context. <br/>\nSome don&#39;t care as long as you don&#39;t cuss, chaw or drink while you&#39;re doing <br/>\nit. I guess you all would need to make the call on how far you are willing to <br/>\ngo to cater to their beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of decent history-based games like Civilization, History <br/>\nof the World (now out of print, but an excellent game if you can find it), <br/>\nDiplomacy, Settlers of Catan, Shogun (I think now called Samurai Sword, not <br/>\nsure), Broadsides and Boarding Parties, Axis and Allies, Kingmaker (I think), <br/>\netc. These are not necessarily role-playing, more strategic/tactical, but <br/>\nrole-playing elements can be added. And of course, all the Avalon Hill games <br/>\nlike Panzer Blitz, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo easy-to-learn card games (although they&#39;re cards, and you may run into <br/>\ntrouble with that unless you can explain it&#39;s more like Uno than gambling ;^) <br/>\nare &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (by GMT Games) and &quot;Great Dalmuti&quot; (I think by Wizards of the <br/>\nCoast, although that&#39;s the only &quot;wizard&quot; content ;^). Both of these can <br/>\ninclude a good deal of roleplaying in the course of play and have the <br/>\nadvantage of appealing to and being suitable for a broad range of ages. Both <br/>\nalso have really excellent art and have stimulated a lot of <br/>\nresearch/discussion in our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother historical route that involves research and cool art is miniatures <br/>\nwargaming -- little scale armies based on historical armies -- which veteran <br/>\ngamers often classify under the title &quot;Ancients.&quot; One of the easiest and <br/>\nsatisfying (i.e., games don&#39;t have to drag on for days) systems I&#39;ve run into <br/>\nis DBA (De Bellis Antiquitatis). Players research and paint their figures (or <br/>\ncan buy them painted, natch) and then pit the armies against one another <br/>\nunder a set of easily-grasped rules. This game, like Risk, involves dice, so <br/>\nagain, there may be some resistance in your community even though this isn&#39;t <br/>\ndirectly gambling. There are a lot of great websites online devoted to this <br/>\ngame, but one of my favourites is my friend&#39;s: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~kuijt/dba.html\">http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~kuijt/dba.html</a> -- there is also an online version <br/>\nof DBA (called DBAOL ;^) which is really excellent: www.dbaol.com -- also <br/>\nvarious clubs. If you have any DBA questions, I know that any of the links <br/>\nyou can find from the Kuijt address above will win you a tonne of encouraging <br/>\ninfo, and the maintainers of the websites will happily talk your ears off <br/>\nabout it. :^)<br/>\n<br/>\nPendragon is a D&D alternate which is (roughly) based in Arthurian legend. <br/>\nSupposedly less hack-and-slash, more roleplaying. Ditto Prince Valiant, which <br/>\nis set against the background of the comic strip. Both emphasize playing the <br/>\ncharacter of chivalrous knight. Heroes and Champions are both roleplaying <br/>\ngames that are based on comic book superheroes. Again, fantasy, but maybe <br/>\nmore palatable... One future-based game is Traveller; there are others of <br/>\nthis ilk.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoo! I just remembered a couple of somewhat-reality-based roleplaying games <br/>\nwe used to play -- one was called Boot Hill, and was set in the Wild West. <br/>\nStill involved killing, however. But no magic. One bullet could kill. There <br/>\nwas another one that was technology-based -- involved making up gee-whiz <br/>\ncontraptions like Q does in James Bond movies and having characters &quot;learn&quot; <br/>\nskills. I think it was called Top Secret. It was fantasy in the same way all <br/>\nspy thrillers are, but not magic. Again, prolly involved killing though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll killing-based games can be converted to defeating- or stunning-games, we <br/>\ndiscovered. Just takes imagination and willingness to fiddle with words. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a roleplaying game called Toon (or maybe Toons?) where you don&#39;t die, <br/>\njust get hit in the face w/ pies, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if all else fails, your kids can make up their own roleplaying game, <br/>\nperhaps based on Narnia (admittedly very otherworldly, but often accepted <br/>\nwhere others are not because of C.S. Lewis & underlying Christian content of <br/>\nseries) or Pilgrim&#39;s Progress. Or convert D&D to be reality-based. Instead of <br/>\nencountering goblins, perhaps a very bad headache? Do you have aspirin along? <br/>\nNo? Well, you succumb! :^D Dragons might be a loss of faith -- which can be <br/>\nfought off by quoting the right bible verse! OK, so perhaps it looks like I&#39;m <br/>\nreaching here. But my brother and I honestly went down paths like these <br/>\nsometimes in order to play with kids in our community. I don&#39;t know how far <br/>\nyou guys are willing to go to engage those around you in play. Some of the <br/>\nbest games we played were ones we made up ourselves (once you figure out how <br/>\nto develop a fair &quot;universe&quot; [i.e., system of play], possibilities are <br/>\nendless).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;m leaving out vast piles of obvious suggestions I should be making, <br/>\nbut I&#39;d better stop now before this becomes a novel.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nWynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":296,"nextTopicId":314}}
