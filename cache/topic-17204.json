He<br/>\ngets along with kids of all different ages and is way ahead of his age peers<br/>\nacademically.  They just decided to move him up a grade so he&#39;d be<br/>\nchallenged more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTim is really liking school, but he knows he doesn&#39;t have to be there and<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t give a darn about his grades.  So far, he&#39;s gone every day but<br/>\none when we went to the art museum instead, and today, because he&#39;s got the<br/>\nflu.  And he&#39;s done most all the work, although he refused to color the<br/>\ntrain cars according to the instructions after doing the math problems<br/>\ninside them.  The teacher threatened him with a poor grade if he didn&#39;t<br/>\ncolor them and he told her he didn&#39;t care and I wouldn&#39;t care, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat earned me a phone call from the teacher, who was unpleasantly surprised<br/>\nto learn that Tim was right that I didn&#39;t care, and that I thought<br/>\nworksheets are a poor way to teach children anything.  His new teacher<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t believe in worksheets and thinks children need lots of opportunities<br/>\nto learn by doing.  I think we&#39;ll get along just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, don&#39;t fear Holly going to school.  There really are some good<br/>\nteachers out there who are fun and challenging and she might get lucky and<br/>\nhave someone like that.  Or she could get by the books, worksheet-happy<br/>\nteachers and last about 3 days.  Either way, she&#39;ll be fine because she has<br/>\nparents that love and support her, and don&#39;t value her based on grades or<br/>\nschool status.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17203,"nextTopicId":17205}}
