He&#39;s done a lot of skateboarding and says it&#39;s entertaining to have pain free crashes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s never been into the Grand Theft Auto type games but enjoyed playing Fable for awhile - it&#39;s a game set up so the main character can be Good or Evil or anything in between, and the end game plays out differently based on those choices. It&#39;s rated... &quot;teen&quot; I think - fade out scenes for the sex. He played it for both extremes, played to find out if his character (the main character is always male) could marry another man, played to see if he could have sex without getting married (no), tried to see how many &quot;spouses&quot; he could have in how many towns and generally had fun pushing the parameters of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n He&#39;s a nice guy. Now and then he has gotten himself into some iffy situations, but he has gotten out of them quickly - he has no interest in fighting in real life, not even the casual drunken fisticuffs which are something of a norm in the redneck south, and certainly not anything involving knives or guns. He&#39;s careful and sensitive in his relationships. Games didn&#39;t make him who he is, they&#39;re for fun, and maybe sometimes a way to consider difficult subjects safely, but not some kind of practice for real life. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Video game/TV viewing","postDate":"1356889264","msgId":70059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFRkY0NUI5LTQxMkYtNEQ1RS1CRkZGLTU3OEEwQzYyRkQ1N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTY4MDY0MjYuNTY4NzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NDUwMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ4NEM1ODQ3LTk0RUQtNDBGNC1CNDZBLUEwRDQzOUVEMzRBNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGtibjhndCtlc3JxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM1NjgwNjQyNi41Njg3Ny5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTg0NTAzLm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70052,"nextInTopic":70060,"prevInTime":70058,"nextInTime":70060,"topicId":70008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

No real prostitutes or cops are killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes roleplaying is about playing a role you&#39;re drawn to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes roleplaying is about exploring what life is like when the rules are different.<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote recently:<br/>\n<br/>\nGames are about exploring a world where the rules are different. It&#39;s fun to &quot;kill&quot; things in a game *because* it&#39;s not real life. In a game you get to do things you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to do in real life. In the case of war, you get to experience the strategy of hunting and killing�and being hunted and killed�without having to kill real people, without hurting their families and friends.<br/>\nDoes reading murder mysteries make people want to get away with murder?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying a game, reading a book, doesn&#39;t change the real life consequences of those actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the technology of war, always have. All those machines and their powerful and destructive abilities are really cool. But it doesn&#39;t make me like what they&#39;re designed to do. If there was never a need for another war, that would be wonderful. I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. At one point I could have done some serious damage to someone. It didn&#39;t make me want to hurt people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I do want to encourage that kind of disregard for human life and I know it is a game. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I assume you mean you DO NOT want to encourage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t disregarding human life. They&#39;re playing the role of someone with a disregard of human life. They&#39;re seeing what it&#39;s like to be someone like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you think you son would like to actually be someone like that? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would it feel if you over heard your husband saying &quot;I don&#39;t want my wife reading murder mysteries. I don&#39;t want her to treat life so casually as though murder were an easy solution.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t that sound really disconnected? Like he&#39;s judging you from the surface rather than from knowing and trusting who you are?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids have a better handle on the difference between reality and fantasy than adults seem to. Your head may be saying it knows the difference but your emotions are saying they&#39;re the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you play? Not everyone will love video games any more than all people will love The Beatles. But playing them to understand better, to get to know your children better, will grow closer relationships. I personally find it really off-putting when someone rants about a show then says they&#39;ve never seen it. Don&#39;t judge things by what they look like. Don&#39;t judge people by the surface.

I get really uncomfortable when the game has a lot of sexual stuff in it or a lot of cussing.  My teen sons were not into video games but my 11 year old son is really into them.  He has been asking for games where the label says sexual content. I do not think that is his reason for wanting them but it is in there. He current plays Teen and Mature content games.  I know there are games where the player can kill prostitutes and cops and such and I really do not like that. Again I do not know that my son would even be interested in that part of the game. I do want to encourage that kind of disregard for human life and I know it is a game.

Learning can happen while one is walking in the woods, watching a movie, riding a horse, playing a video game, reading a book, playing a board game, cooking or hanging out telling jokes.

Probably because there aren&#39;t any.  I have experience with<br/>\nunlimited gaming, decades of it.  My two oldest would rather game than eat<br/>\nor sleep, though eventually those needs do get met!  My oldest was obsessed<br/>\nwith Pokemon on the game boy when he was 7.  It escalated and intensified<br/>\nfrom then on, and he was unschooled from then on too.<br/>\n<br/>\n We had to concern ourselves with the recommended age groups several times<br/>\nbut he showed us he could master them and he is far more interested in<br/>\npuzzle style games and depth of plot than just shoot em ups.  He did play<br/>\nthe shooter games, but he loved hacking them.  It was fascinating to see<br/>\nwhat he did.  He wold make the guns shoot other guns out instead of<br/>\nbullets, etc.  he has always wanted to go into gaming as a profession and<br/>\nprobably will.  He loves creative games like minecraft and unusual games<br/>\nlike portal.  He knows the best game creators and respects them. He is very<br/>\ndismissive when people claim that violent killers &quot;were known to play video<br/>\ngames, oh my!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second teen has followed in his footsteps but his interests are slightly<br/>\ndifferent.  He is an athlete who practices 4 hours a day 5 days a week.  He<br/>\nis homeschooled but he uses an online college prep school so he is NCAA<br/>\neligible for his sport.  He and his teammates and friends love to play the<br/>\ngroup shooting games all together.  They can have fun and get together at<br/>\nall hours and their parents don&#39;t have to drive them all over.  He also<br/>\nlikes to shoot real guns at ranges, maybe 3-4 x a year,  we do not own<br/>\nguns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he plays too much.  But he still does it.  He is expected to do<br/>\nwell in school and he is.  I wish he&#39;d go outside more.  I have not found a<br/>\ngreat solution.  But he does do school and plenty !!! Of sport.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext son has some developmental delays and is 9 but maturity of a 7.  He<br/>\nhas also loved gaming forever too.  Unschooled too.  Plays a lot of the<br/>\ntime.  He is not allowed any of the shooting games except minecraft which<br/>\nisn&#39;t really.  He was thrown off Toontown years ago for hacking and then<br/>\nalso from club penguin for the same thing. I admit to being a little proud<br/>\n( he called it &quot;finding glitches&quot; where he could float in the air and have<br/>\nunlimited money etc)  but of course not for breaking the rules /things he<br/>\nagreed to.  Since we moved, he is back on Toontown ( new ip) and very<br/>\ninvolved in it.  My worst thing about this is that when they go to battle<br/>\nthe bosses there are other people on the team depending on you. And the<br/>\nattack lasts a loooong time.  Well, what if your mom as to take you some<br/>\nwhere?  This is not good because I do not like making him unhappy and<br/>\nmaking him let down other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me is envious of those no screen families.  So many other<br/>\nactivities.  My kids tend to find other things &quot;boring.&quot; I worry that<br/>\ngaming is to life like porn compared to real life sex.  It may affect<br/>\nneurotransmitters like some kind of opiate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the other part of me says we are going down this tech path as humans<br/>\nand we go where it leads and try to bring our humanity, goodness, and<br/>\nmorality to the process.  They talk tech and are very interested in where<br/>\nthings are going.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never bought them grand theft auto but the oldest has still &quot;gotten<br/>\nit&quot; somehow and showed it to me and showed me the fun parts of it and he is<br/>\nnot interested in the hooker parts and prefers to play a cop rather than a<br/>\nbad guy.  He showed me how creatively it was made, etc.  his dream is to<br/>\nmake hockey games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\nExcuse all the errors, babe sleeping in my arms<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, December 29, 2012, Tiffani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have never had limits on anything like tv, video games or computers.<br/>\n&gt;  My husbands loves video games so my kids have always had them available.<br/>\n&gt;  I am currently struggling with types of games.

I eat many local foods, as do my husband and son.  We know<br/>\nour meat farmers personally and love farmers&#39; markets and belong to a CSA.<br/>\nTheir blog post really bothered me - and then as I thought about why, I<br/>\nrealized it was because I don&#39;t eat local for the reasons the authors were<br/>\nfocused on when they wrote. They were arguing against things that weren&#39;t<br/>\neven on my radar.  The questions they were asking about local food (did it<br/>\nreally cost less, is it really better for the environment, is it a practical<br/>\nway to feed the world, etc. as I recall) weren&#39;t my questions.  I eat local<br/>\nbecause local food tastes good - because I like knowing who grows my food -<br/>\nbecause of a lot of reasons.  Their economics-perspective, in that case,<br/>\nwasn&#39;t helpful to me - so I set it aside and went on happily eating my food<br/>\nbecause I *wanted* to and not because it was going to please or not-please<br/>\neconomists who weren&#39;t eating with me anyway :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, when I read Pam&#39;s article for the first time years ago -<br/>\nit immediately clicked for me.  It explained in a totally different language<br/>\n(economics) so many things about why restrictions don&#39;t work - and was so<br/>\nclear about what happens when parents try to restrict TV or food or<br/>\nvideogames or anything else.   Do I personally boil the whole world down to<br/>\nthe same ideas and use the same terms economists do?  Nope.  But can I<br/>\nappreciate what Pam is saying, understand it, and send it off as the best<br/>\nexplanation I have yet found for anyone who asks me why we don&#39;t try to<br/>\ncontrol my 9 year old&#39;s eating, watching, playing, etc.?  Yep :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I posted the article on my own Facebook wall, I&#39;m certain I have<br/>\nrelatives and friends who have closed minds and closed ears on the topic of<br/>\nrestrictions, or different not-up-for-discussion opinions on the subject,<br/>\nwho would read it and feel about it the same way I felt about the local food<br/>\nblog entry - they&#39;d be disagreeing and jumping up and down and telling me<br/>\nhow wrong it all is.  But that doesn&#39;t mean it really is wrong - it means<br/>\nthey can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) see where it&#39;s right - or that it simply doesn&#39;t speak<br/>\nto their own particular rationale behind restrictions, and so it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nclick with them (there are articles out in the world that speak against<br/>\nrestrictions from different perspectives - psychology, people&#39;s unhealthy<br/>\ndesire for control over others, etc. - the economist&#39;s is but one view, but<br/>\nit&#39;s such a clear and direct view in this case, it seems just about perfect<br/>\nto me :-)).   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the article makes sense to you, and if reading it inspires you to stop<br/>\nand pause and think every time you debate trying to restrict your kids as<br/>\nthey game or eat or play, then that&#39;s great!  Guaranteeing it will make<br/>\nsense to others is beyond what you can do.  I wouldn&#39;t stop eating CSA<br/>\ncarrots because grocery store carrots are cheaper - and you&#39;re not going to<br/>\nget people to agree with Pam simply because you know she&#39;s right :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Video game/TV viewing","postDate":"1356812088","msgId":70028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtibml2bys2Ym52QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70025,"nextInTopic":70030,"prevInTime":70027,"nextInTime":70029,"topicId":70008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes kids will ask &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; when they realize you&#39;re saying yes a lot more, but if they don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t make some kind of announcement like &quot;no more rules!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since you&#39;re already there...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The little ones are weepy and bickering by the end of the day<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you bringing snacks and drinks? That can help. Are there enough games to go around? What are they bickering about? <br/>\n<br/>\n2 player games? It can take a certain amount of bickering for some kids to figure out how to play 2-player games together, and every player isn&#39;t suited to 2-player games - or at least not with just anyone. My daughter gets very crabby playing 2-player games unless the other person has the same goals for the game. She does well with group projects on Minecraft, but she&#39;s choosey about them - she makes sure she and the other builders have the same goals to start with. Lately she&#39;s been dabbling in fan-fiction and trying to decide if she wants to write a story With someone else - and her experience with games is helping her decide what kind of person would make a good writing partner for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo bickering isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing - it&#39;s part of how they&#39;re learning about complex social skills like teamwork and compromise. Do make sure there are enough games to go around so no-one is stuck with the option of either playing a 2-player game or not playing at all, and make sure other needs are being met. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think some of the frustration is coming from too much time indoors, it can help to plan something fun to start first thing in the morning so you can sweep up the whole crew to go do something and work out some &quot;ants in the pants&quot; before they all settle down to some serious gaming. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;the big kids are zombies.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You mean they&#39;re getting so involved in doing something they enjoy they&#39;re forgetting to eat, sleep, and bathe? That would describe many of the artisans I know, including my partner ;) Passionate people can sometimes get alllllll wrapped up in a project. It helps to bring food and gently take care of details for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, I&#39;d like to know what other people&#39;s experiences have been with transitioning to the unlimited screen time, especially in regard to pre-teen/teenage boys and gaming.  How long did it take for them to level out?  etc.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson left school and a home with severe restrictions on computer use when he was 13 - a big instant change, since we weren&#39;t going to impose the restrictions he had been used to - and for close to two years spent the majority of his waking hours playing Runescape, mostly at night. Now he&#39;s 19, just got back from working on an organic farm all autumn, and is currently out digging a foundation for an improvement on his little cabin in the woods. He&#39;s rarely even in front of a computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 11 and unschooled from the start and if her life were measured in &quot;screen time&quot; there would be a lot of it. A great deal of what she does involves a computer: writing, reading online, drawing, animating, games, socializing, researching. I don&#39;t expect that to &quot;level out&quot; in the sense of her giving up the computer for other things. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact &quot;leveling out&quot; is kind of insulting. It implies that passion is undesirable, a fault. When will my daughter&#39;s writing &quot;level out&quot;? My partner&#39;s artistry? I wouldn&#39;t want either of them to be anything other than who they are, for all they&#39;re sometimes inconvenient people who don&#39;t wash dishes or fold laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":459359078,"authorName":"Regan","from":"Regan &lt;oregano3@...&gt;","profile":"persea112","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Video game/TV viewing","postDate":"1356808399","msgId":70023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQjVFODAxLTEzNzMtNDRFMy04NDE5LTY3N0FCOEU4ODI1OEBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70019,"nextInTopic":70025,"prevInTime":70022,"nextInTime":70024,"topicId":70008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It might be helpful to focus on being kind to your children, rather than on letting go of previous limits.

Your focus on screen time (either feast or famine), is getting in the way of your childrens&#39; peace and happiness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you focus more on helping your children have wonderful days, the ends of those days are less likely to be full of &quot;weepy&quot;, &quot;bickering&quot; and &quot;zombies&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour previous limit on video games and tv wasn&#39;t helpful.  But neither is a reactive response on your part, of simply providing them with the converse.  When there has been any kind of unwanted lack, lots of care and support and time are usually needed to happily make the transition to abundance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA fundamental aspect of unschooling, is the importance of supporting your children in their explorations of the world.  It is more fundamental than whether or not you limit their access to tv. <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp your children enjoy more access to things that were previously limited.  It will take time for it to feel peaceful to them and will be different for each child.  The more you are engaged with your children through this process, the more smooth will be the transition.  Tuning in to where they&#39;re at with it all, will help you to support them as they transition from living an arbitrarily limited life to one in which their desires are important.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 29/12/2012, at 1:37 PM, Howdy wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Throughout the past 2 years we have evolved from 5 kids (8, 9, 11, 13, and 15) in private school to homeschooling, and finally this winter to unschooling.

He&#39;s a handy man. He doesn&#39;t like to sit and talk. He enjoys finding things that aren&#39;t working, and fixing them. The faucet in our kitchen was leaking. It was slowly ruining our wooden counter tops. He wanted to fix it. He wanted me to help, so that I might be able to do the same thing one day when he wasn&#39;t there. I like that kind of thing, so I happily agreed. He found our tool box, handed me a couple tools, asked me to wait a moment, and told me he would be right back. While he was in the other room momentarily, I (over-enthusiastically) began to take the faucet apart. He returned just as I was disassembling all the pieces, paused in the doorway, and said, &quot;Oh, no! What are you doing? Do you know how they all go back together?&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot; He signed and said, &quot;You don&#39;t just take things apart without paying attention to all the pieces and how they fit together. Slow down. Pay attention to what you are doing. Otherwise, you just end up with a big mess that may or may not be workable in the end.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time, my feelings were hurt. It had been something I had heard from my dad many times in the past. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t until I did the same thing with Unschooling, that I understood his point. I can&#39;t be a plumber without understanding the way all the plumbing components come together to work as they do. I can&#39;t be an Unschooler without an understanding of how natural learning occurs and how meaningful relationships function best. Neither can happen simply because I wish for it, or claim it to be so. Both can happen when I slow down, pay attention to what I&#39;m doing, and notice how the parts come together to make a well-functioning whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can be long-winded at times...but that&#39;s another story...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed appropriate here.  The best thing I did after I realized I took apart all the of the pieces before I knew what I was hoping to accomplish (both with my dad and with unschooling) was to slow down, become a bit more humble, pay attention to those who know more than me, listen, try a bit, watch, and learn.  And, with unschooling, spending as much time with my son as possible, doing the things he loves was, and is, key to understanding how he learns and what is valuable to him.  It also has the added benefit of being a lot of fun most of the time :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304763189,"authorName":"jencookies43","from":"&quot;jencookies43&quot; &lt;cookiesforthree@...&gt;","profile":"jencookies43","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Video game/TV viewing","postDate":"1356802301","msgId":70018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtibjlkdCtsbXRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70016,"nextInTopic":70019,"prevInTime":70017,"nextInTime":70019,"topicId":70008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They will regulate themselves on this. My internal regulator is to wake up at dawn and fall asleep at sundown.

My kids have no problem with video games or TV. I sure did. Even though I played with them and had fun, I couldn&#39;t let go of that thought in my brain that I was somehow leading them down a bad road. I stopped one day and really took some time to think about what was causing me so much anxiety about TV and video games?  I had full access to TV as a child and games were quite new in the 70&#39;s and I really wasn&#39;t very interested in them later in life, until the Internet became available. What I discovered was my need to control and protect. I did not have the relationship with my parents that I have with my kids. When I saw something on TV that I did not understand or something on the news that scared me, I did not feel comfortable talking to my parents about it and kept it inside and worried away at it and it grew to more than what it was. My parents were violent with me, so I really felt no safety in my little world. <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to today. My kids do have me to help them feel safe and guide them to comfort and be a comfort to them. I do play games with them or am at least nearby if not in the same room.  I really stink at Black Ops, so I tend to be the last person in the house invited to play this game with them. Maybe if they need target practice I&#39;ll get invited.  My middle son taught himself to read while playing games. I love watching most of the shows my kids watch. Our house favorite is The Regular Show. My kids delight when I tell them it reminds me of my teen years in the 80&#39;s with hair nation rock and silly 80&#39;s jargon. This often leads to other discussions about my teen years, etc. So grateful for DVR&#39;s. My youngest will pause during most shows to start a conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur life did not end up revolving around TV and video games, which was a fear of mine. These things are part of our life and they revolve around our life. We do many other things as well. We connect, we play at the park, we have snowball fights, we bike ride as fast as we can downhill, we drop cupcakes from 20 feet in the air just to hear the splat, we talk about our view points when others bring up horrible subjects of real life shooters who have played video games (gee, hasn&#39;t everyone under the age of 30???), we lay around in bed together talking, laughing, wrestling with our dogs, and just last night stayed up till 4am playing a new video game. I actually passed out long before 4 am, but the kids tucked themselves in bed about that time. We also spend time apart working on our own little projects or two of us might be working on a project together. We have two engineer types in the house that can get completely absorbed in soldering irons and shop tools.  I love how life ebbs and flows. Swirls in different directions or just stays on one course for a while. I just love my life and my family. It&#39;s a good thing to have fun and make memories and bonds of love and trust.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Video game/TV viewing","postDate":"1356797658","msgId":70015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4NEM1ODQ3LTk0RUQtNDBGNC1CNDZBLUEwRDQzOUVEMzRBNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtibGwwbStpNGR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70013,"nextInTopic":70016,"prevInTime":70014,"nextInTime":70016,"topicId":70008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Fast forward to 9 days of our kids looking at screens for 7-12 hours apiece, we question it. -=- If they were reading, would you say 9 days of our kids","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-795895116\">-=-Fast forward to 9 days of our kids looking at screens for 7-12 hours apiece, we question it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they were reading, would you say &quot;9 days of our kids looking at paper&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Anyway, I&#39;d like to know what other people&#39;s experiences have been with transitioning to the unlimited screen time, especially in regard to pre-teen/teenage boys and gaming. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids didn&#39;t transition because we didn&#39;t limit. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Screen time&quot; is a boogeyman.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you measure cloth time at your house?

It&#39;s not about computer time. It&#39;s not about television. It may not have fallen within your original search. It&#39;s about time with a child even though the title of the piece is how to unschool. It&#39;s about being generous with your time with your children. While they are playing are you hanging out with them? Are you looking for ways to connect with them and with their interest? Are you touching them while they play, making sure that they have food at regular intervals during the day, bringing them drinks? Are you taking the time to be with them, at least the same amount of time that you were spending with them before you decided to do it? <br/>\n<br/>\nWeepy and bickering suggests tired and hungry. Rather than laying hungry and tired at the door of television watching and video game playing think about how long a day they&#39;ve had, think about what they&#39;ve eaten. Feed them. Set up something quiet and calm for them to do. Read to them. Watch a movie together. Listen to music. Or maybe go out somewhere. To the mall. To a movie. For an evening swim at an indoor pool. <br/>\n<br/>\nA zombie is a lurching, brain-seeking, fictitious creature. That might be fun. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really what you mean. It may help if you think about what you mean and write those words instead of grab for the word that seems funny while also being cruel. It&#39;s also not descriptive. I don&#39;t really know what it means. Whatever it means, it could indicate that you think video games or television watching are the equivalent to being dead and that they have risen again to lurch about. It indicates that you don&#39;t yet see video games or television watching as a valuable thing. You see them as something that you want your children to self-regulate to a level that is in accordance with what you deem appropriate. Maybe that isn&#39;t true, but the use of the term zombie isn&#39;t a happy embracing of their choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nNor is the vision of them looking at screens. I have screens on my windows to keep insect out. I need a few more.

Just this moment, or that moment past, Linnaea came over and asked me to compare, for cuteness, owls versus cockatiels. Sloths won. But giant earthworms came into the discussion.

That whenever people come and say something isn&#39;t working with unschooling her first thought is that they need to spend more time with their child or with their children. Time. Spend time with your children. Hang out with them while they are doing what they love. Find out why they love it. Know that it has value because these valuable people value it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s not about computer time. It&#39;s not about television. It may not have fallen within your original search. It&#39;s about time with a child even though the title of the piece is how to unschool. It&#39;s about being generous with your time with your children. While they are playing are you hanging out with them? Are you looking for ways to connect with them and with their interest? Are you touching them while they play, making sure that they have food at regular intervals during the day, bringing them drinks? Are you taking the time to be with them, at least the same amount of time that you were spending with them before you decided to do it? <br/>\n<br/>\nWeepy and bickering suggests tired and hungry. Rather than laying hungry and tired at the door of television watching and video game playing think about how long a day they&#39;ve had, think about what they&#39;ve eaten. Feed them. Set up something quiet and calm for them to do. Read to them. Watch a movie together. Listen to music. Or maybe go out somewhere. To the mall. To a movie. For an evening swim at an indoor pool. <br/>\n<br/>\nA zombie is a lurching, brain-seeking, fictitious creature. That might be fun. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really what you mean. It may help if you think about what you mean and write those words instead of grab for the word that seems funny while also being cruel. It&#39;s also not descriptive. I don&#39;t really know what it means. Whatever it means, it could indicate that you think video games or television watching are the equivalent to being dead and that they have risen again to lurch about. It indicates that you don&#39;t yet see video games or television watching as a valuable thing. You see them as something that you want your children to self-regulate to a level that is in accordance with what you deem appropriate. Maybe that isn&#39;t true, but the use of the term zombie isn&#39;t a happy embracing of their choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nNor is the vision of them looking at screens. I have screens on my windows to keep insect out. I need a few more.
