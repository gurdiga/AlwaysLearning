It looks  <br/>\n&gt; exactly like what it&#39;s supposed to look like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And related to that, in zen paintings (Chinese brush paintings), there  <br/>\n&gt; are solid dark lines, and more watery lines, more grey.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With singing voices, someone can be right on a pitch and stay there-- <br/>\n&gt; not slide up to it, or down to it from another note, but it it exactly  <br/>\n&gt; where it is without hesitation and then stay there, with a clear  <br/>\n&gt; difference between the silence and that note, as with a black ink line  <br/>\n&gt; where the edge of the ink is separate from the white of the paper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are other kinds of singing voices and styles where people  <br/>\n&gt; purposely make their voice raspy so the tone is &quot;wide&quot;--not always at  <br/>\n&gt; the vibration of the note they&#39;re representing, so it&#39;s more like  <br/>\n&gt; sketching that note, or shading it, or using the watery ink.

She  <br/>\nasked what &quot;clear&quot; was, with singing.   I had left the chat, but wrote  <br/>\nlater and said sorry I had missed the question and offered to try to  <br/>\ndescribe it.<br/>\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sure! I&#39;m curious.   When a signer is clear, their fingers form each<br/>\nletter and handshape cleanly, in a visually pleasing way.  I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing that&#39;s what a clear voice is like as well?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe art is a better analogy.   Sometimes people sketch with a pencil  <br/>\nor with paints so that they&#39;ve made lots of short lines that end up  <br/>\nbeing the shape of something, but some people can make one very bold,  <br/>\nsharp line without hesitation and there&#39;s no waver in it.  It looks  <br/>\nexactly like what it&#39;s supposed to look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd related to that, in zen paintings (Chinese brush paintings), there  <br/>\nare solid dark lines, and more watery lines, more grey.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith singing voices, someone can be right on a pitch and stay there-- <br/>\nnot slide up to it, or down to it from another note, but it it exactly  <br/>\nwhere it is without hesitation and then stay there, with a clear  <br/>\ndifference between the silence and that note, as with a black ink line  <br/>\nwhere the edge of the ink is separate from the white of the paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other kinds of singing voices and styles where people  <br/>\npurposely make their voice raspy so the tone is &quot;wide&quot;--not always at  <br/>\nthe vibration of the note they&#39;re representing, so it&#39;s more like  <br/>\nsketching that note, or shading it, or using the watery ink.   The  <br/>\ndifference between note and not-note isn&#39;t as precise or surprising  <br/>\n(surprising isn&#39;t the word; stark? but stark sounds uncomfortable...)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say &quot;clear as a bell&quot; sometimes, but a clear singing voice is  <br/>\nway more clear than a bell.  Bells have after-tones and overtones...  <br/>\nvery messy, physically (meaning the physics of the vibration of the  <br/>\ntone).<br/>\n<br/>\nI sing, but I&#39;m not a singing coach, so I&#39;m probably missing some  <br/>\naspect of terminology here.

I don&#39;t much  <br/>\nlove vibrato, but even with vibrato it needs to average out to the  <br/>\nright pitch.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you think of other ways to describe a clear singing voice?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44287,"nextTopicId":44293}}
