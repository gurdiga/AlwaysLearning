His team would play a match on Saturday mornings and<br/>\npractice on Thursday evenings. Most of the practice consisted of<br/>\ndrilling in the various techniques. Patrick just wanted to play<br/>\nbaseball and wasn&#39;t very keen on spending time throwing a baseball to<br/>\na partner over and over again or jogging around the playing field and<br/>\nthings like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time in his second year, when Patrick was playing for the under<br/>\n10s, there was a recruitment drive to get more 7-10 year olds<br/>\ninterested in playing. It was to run for one half term on Tuesday<br/>\nevenings and was sponsored and free, so no money involved, and there<br/>\nwas an incentive of a free (sponsor labelled) backpack and an MLB cap<br/>\nand t-shirt. Pat was told that if he came along to this he could skip<br/>\nthe Thursday practices, and that it would be just playing baseball,<br/>\ngiving newbies a chance to get a feel for the game (nothing to put<br/>\nthem off, like drills and such!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Patrick thought that was a pretty good deal, playing baseball<br/>\ntwice a week and no drills. We came along to the first week, Patrick<br/>\nwith his glove and in his club uniform, he got his free backpack and<br/>\na Cardinals cap and t-shirt, and all the kids took to the field. But,<br/>\nof course, this was baseball for the benefit of total beginners, so<br/>\nthe coach set up the tee for T-ball. On seeing that, Patrick walked<br/>\noff the field.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was sitting on one of the benches and he came and sat down next to<br/>\nme and said he thought he would be playing baseball, he wasn&#39;t going<br/>\nto play T-ball and he wanted to go home (when he&#39;d been a beginner,<br/>\nhis team coach had pitched to the batters underarm, so he&#39;d never<br/>\nused a tee and I guess he thought T-ball was baseball for babies).<br/>\nAnyway, the guy running the evening followed Patrick over and asked<br/>\nhim what the problem was. Patrick told him he&#39;d come to play baseball<br/>\nand wasn&#39;t going to play T-ball. So the guy was saying something<br/>\nlike, &quot;Come on, you went to all the trouble of getting dressed up in<br/>\nyour uniform and you&#39;re here now, so you don&#39;t want to miss all the<br/>\nfun, do you?&quot;. He looked at me anticipating I would back him up, but<br/>\nI looked up at him and said very pointedly, &quot;He said he&#39;s not playing<br/>\nT-ball.&quot; So the guy stopped talking, kind of shrugged and walked away<br/>\nand Patrick and I went home, no questions asked. I felt really quite<br/>\ngood about both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reminding me. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: parental decisions, choices, progress","postDate":"1238604402","msgId":43619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyMDVwaStzNWZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1NTdGMkNFLTYxN0MtNERDOS04NjM0LUZGMjA3MDEyNjlBMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43609,"nextInTopic":43651,"prevInTime":43618,"nextInTime":43620,"topicId":43568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At a<br/>\nmeeting with his teacher and the school counsellor a few days after<br/>\nthe decision, we agreed as a courtesy to the school that Patrick<br/>\nwould complete the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a totally stupid agreement. The final seven weeks turned out<br/>\nto be very tough for both Patrick and myself - I was the one who was<br/>\ntaking him to school every morning and picking him up in the<br/>\nafternoon, plus I was in school for at least some of the time every<br/>\nday for &quot;moral support&quot; in one way or another - morning assembly,<br/>\nhelping with the reading program and in the canteen, whatever it<br/>\ntook. It was a huge, huge effort that took massive doses of &quot;positive<br/>\nthinking&quot; to cope with and it was all totally UNNECESSARY. We went<br/>\nthrough it because *I* decided to honour the agreement I&#39;d made. It<br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter to anybody else, they just got on with their lives.<br/>\nEven when it got tough, I didn&#39;t have the sense to think, &quot;Maybe we<br/>\nought to forget what we agreed to and quit right now.&quot; What an idiot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely, if I had my time over again, I wouldn&#39;t even have<br/>\nbothered with a meeting with the school&#39;s representatives after the<br/>\ndecision to remove my son had been made; I would have taken Patrick<br/>\nout of school on the day and too bad if the school didn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m probably adequately &quot;deschooled&quot; these days (&quot;Schools?<br/>\nYeah, don&#39;t *they* have an overinflated sense of their importance in<br/>\nthe world?&quot;) and I&#39;ve been able to make it up to my son and more and<br/>\nwe&#39;re both over it (we had the conversation a few years ago).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe year after my son quit school, a local karate club was recruiting<br/>\nnew members and Patrick was curious so my wife and I signed him up<br/>\nfor a trial period that cost $120 (a non-refundable deal). I took him<br/>\nalong to the first evening&#39;s class - which, as it happens, was in the<br/>\nassembly hall at his former school - and the guy running the class<br/>\nhad all the kids lined up and doing drills and was shouting out his<br/>\ninstructions like a sergeant-major, and I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Hmm ... I<br/>\nwonder if Patrick is going to take to this&quot;. Patrick didn&#39;t like it<br/>\nat all. So he quit after the first lesson. My wife and I simply wrote<br/>\noff the $120.

Listening to<br/>\nParenting Peacefully is my #1 recommendation for beginning to collect voices<br/>\nto live in your head; voices who can lead you where you want to be - in<br/>\npeaceful relationship with yourself and your loved ones. You can do both at<br/>\nthe same time, Sandra speaks of this (in my head, often) as Practice What<br/>\nYou Want to Be Good At.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI remind myself, while breathing, that I do not have the energy to address<br/>\nthe voices who may insist I *cannot* __________; I work tko reinforce and<br/>\nlisten to the voices that lead me to what I *CAN* do.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone CAN channel their inner unschooler.  Invite your image of your<br/>\nfavorite unschooler to sit in the corner of your living room - act as if you<br/>\nare doing unschooing under their watchful eyes and advice. I praqcticed this<br/>\nfor MONTHS before I even met Sandra in real life.  Being in her space and<br/>\naround her children really helped reinforced those visits, along with the<br/>\ncassette of the talk ;) I have other unschoolers I still call upon to<br/>\nvisit-in-spirit, depending on my situation-at-hand (I had a whole team ready<br/>\nfor my recent visit to the school-thinking friends and in-laws last week -<br/>\nit *still* helps keep me calm and in practice of what I really want to be<br/>\ngood at).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to remember, too, that even the calmest, most confident<br/>\nunschooling parent, had normal, human baggage to overcome, too.

Kids, like<br/>\nadults react in the way all people do, to control and lack of choices. <br/>\nThey will do everything in their power to resist, their whole existence<br/>\ndepends on sovereignty and the search for it.  If you seek to control<br/>\nanother, I imagine, the first thing you do is to remove choices to<br/>\nestablish power and dominance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been dealing with this for years, this hurt child, friend of my<br/>\ndaughter.  I was grappling with my own feelings of lack of control and<br/>\nchoices about what I CAN do.  I&#39;ve been thinking about this since<br/>\nyesterday&#39;s conversation.  I&#39;ve thought about it before.  There was<br/>\nsomething different about our conversation yesterday, it was as if, for<br/>\nthe first time, she has recognized that she has choices, which is<br/>\nsimultaneously beautiful and scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve allowed, to an extent, this man dictate how things will go, and do<br/>\nas much damage control as possible, just so that our kids can spend<br/>\nsmall amounts of time together.

This relates to another topic recently about<br/>\nfailure to meet standards.  Making choices involves trial and error and<br/>\nlearning.  Without ever making the choice to try something, wether the<br/>\noutcome is successful or not, we will never learn from it.
