Some never <br/>\nconsidered that ideas have origins and histories.<br/>\n+++++<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe somewhere in between...or maybe both. The possibilities are infinite. <br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy reading/hearing/learning histories and origins but that doesn&#39;t mean that my ideas came from there. Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was driving a friend&#39;s child to the lake, he is 5 or 6. Wolfgang was in front with me. The boy was telling me about how when we got to the lake he was going to fill up a balloon with water in the lake, to make a water balloon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI started to say, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that is going to work. You need...&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWolfgang put his hand on my arm and said softly, &quot;He can discover that on his own. Can&#39;t he?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI smiled and nodded my head. The boy continued talking with excitement about all of *his* ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hardly think he is the first person to have the idea to fill a water balloon in standing water and I don&#39;t think he was the first person to have realized it doesn&#39;t work very well for water balloons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose were *his* ideas and his discoveries and the only deep history behind them might be that someone created balloons and latex but none of that necessarily influenced him. Because if those people didn&#39;t invent balloons someone else might have...maybe someone else did...but they didn&#39;t know how to get it out to people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome ideas are simply logical conclusions on thought and sometimes it&#39;s impossible to conclude where or if they originated from anywhere specific. Everything is connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because someone thought it first doesn&#39;t make it their idea. Or does it? There is a possibility that someone thought it before them but never wrote it down or shared it with anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an example of this...I discovered the Freedom to Learn Blog on Psychology Today back on Dr. Gray&#39;s very first post in July 2008. I posted both the first and the second entry on my local unschooling list. It spread, FAST. Now he is speaking at the Northeast Unschooling Conference. It that because I posted on our list, probably not. Was that a factor? Maybe...who knows. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who found it early on. I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only one who read it and thought &quot;unschooling!&quot; But it was certainly my idea at the time. I came up with that connection but it was a logical idea. I&#39;m clearly not the only one who has come up with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are plenty of examples in history about parallels. Societies and people making the same discoveries without ever having contact with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThought/ideas/conclusions are all evolutionary. They evolve for adaptive reasons, curiosity, connection or through mistakes and surprises. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also devolve but that&#39;s an entirely different thing isn&#39;t it? Or is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are connections, there are influences sometimes they are clear sometimes they are not either way they are everywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife, ideas, inspiration it ebbs and flows just like thought and and ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bad Seed?","postDate":"1279127217","msgId":56059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERGMEM0RkRGLUE4RkEtNDA5RS1BOTAwLTM1ODkwMzVENERFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsSnR3ckVMV2o4ZU54aTZ6aXRtS25xb3paUnhmUTFtMGxjUTdGcUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":56053,"nextInTopic":56076,"prevInTime":56058,"nextInTime":56060,"topicId":55956,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Was she able to process the changes that created more options for her?-=- Yes.

And now when the woman giving birth may<br/>\nalso have no biological relationship to the child...........................<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many &quot;records&quot;  the attempt to have birth certificates serve dual<br/>\nfunctions (tracing biological heritage as well as designating &quot;legal&quot;<br/>\nrelationships) means they are not very good at either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think they should have some other notation.

Not parentage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mixed feelings about re-issued birth certificates, but it&#39;s really standard now. We were not presented with any option to do anything but have Yehva issued a new birth cert with our names as her parents as part of the process. It makes many things easier--it&#39;s one document I have to present for proof of ID and relationship, rather than 2 (birth certificate and stack of papers from the court finalizing the adoption). It does seem strange to me, though. I would have been very happy with a birth certificate that reflected both birth and adoptive parents, and then, too, that would be a record that an adult adoptee, or her descendants, could use to trace both adoptive and biological families. It would be both more honest and more complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s the most horrible abuse of public records imaginable, though. That&#39;s awfully strong language. People use public records to track and stalk ex-girlfriends, or to steal people&#39;s identities. Those are two things that seem worse to me than my daughter&#39;s birth certificate listing as her mother the woman who took her home from the hospital and who has cared for her since instead of the woman who gave her up at birth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  And they want to teach the rest of the world a lesson,  <br/>\n&gt; so they don&#39;t ever discuss the adoption.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is really uncommon these days. It&#39;s generally considered healthier for everyone to be honest about adoption. I suppose it&#39;s kind of ironic that there is a big movement toward open adoption at the same time that revised birth certificates have become the norm--we have tons of info about Yehva&#39;s birthparents, for instance, although we do not have a fully open adoption. In the US at least it is pretty much not done anymore to pretend that an adopted child is biological, and it&#39;s common for agencies to advocate for open adoption with both birth families and adoptive families.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\nmom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, almost 3<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bad Seed?","postDate":"1279048530","msgId":55966,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZFMzFDQThELTAxQUUtNDlDQy05QzRDLTg2QUE0NUMwOUYyM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQyRjlERTgyNTdGNzRDNUVCQzkwMkEzOENFQTIwRUU5QEx5bGFQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluNVpzY0h2T1VxUWNkNUw5Nm83VUVfbXlxSjVEOHE2TG5FMUkzN0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEE2OTY0OEQ0Nzc1OTQ0NzY4RDMwOTQ0RjQxQjkzQ0JGQEx5bGFQQz4gPDY0MUExNEU1LTBFNjItNEY2Mi1BRUE5LTlEMkVBMDIyMzdGQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEQyRjlERTgyNTdGNzRDNUVCQzkwMkEzOENFQTIwRUU5QEx5bGFQQz4="},"prevInTopic":55962,"nextInTopic":55967,"prevInTime":55965,"nextInTime":55967,"topicId":55956,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- the story about the adult who wouldn t call his mother on her birthday, to me, offered no evidence or compelling argument for genetic or chemical","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-133323954\">-=- the story about the adult who wouldn&#39;t call his mother on her  <br/>\nbirthday, to me, offered no evidence or compelling argument for  <br/>\ngenetic or chemical influences - there was NOTHING about that  <br/>\nrelationship, really, first hand. also, adoption and fetal alcohol  <br/>\nsyndrome etc, would make for an obvious &quot;reason&quot; for &quot;bad seedishness&quot;  <br/>\nthat would have been mentioned by the psychiatrist - not just - bad  <br/>\nseed, no reason, if that makes any sense. ...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article wasn&#39;t a full analysis of a child&#39;s entire life and his  <br/>\nparents&#39; entire upbringing and their genetic breakdown, though.
