But what I see in my kids and hear from stories like these are so different. I do not think I will ever be able to see studying and learning quite like an unschooling person can. <br/>\nI find it fascinating observing my kids.<br/>\nI think if a parent takes the time to really watch their kids doing things and learning they would also be impressed like I am.<br/>\nSo take the time. Watch them. Observe. These unschool kids are so different and so amazing !<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Always Learning &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 6, 2012 1:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Holly&#39;s math final<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s 21 and is taking a remedial math class at the community college.
