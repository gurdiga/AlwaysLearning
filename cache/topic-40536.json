Parents need to have boundaries around themselves that <br/>\nprotect their body and things and sanity, and respect their kid&#39;s <br/>\nboundaries as well.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good book, just skip the &quot;boundaries with kids&quot; section.

Lack of focus and clarity, but maybe a fine focus  <br/>\non spreading the idea that anything and everything is as good as  <br/>\nanything and everything else, so that someone can make money running  <br/>\na school to help people homeschool.  By accepting money, she makes   <br/>\nherself &quot;an expert.&quot;  And if an expert says unschooling is this or  <br/>\nthat, and people paid her to say so, what does that do for people  <br/>\nlike me, and Joyce?

It didn&#39;t have to be at the kitchen  <br/>\ntable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis paragraph from that Bob sent made me think of that:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But what you find on this spectrum is what we call school at home  <br/>\non one end, which is what I just described, and then on the other end  <br/>\nis the opposite.  It�s more of a bottom up rather than a top down.  <br/>\nIt�s actually engaging your children in a discussion, where you want  <br/>\nto check to see what is their learning style?  Do they learn better  <br/>\nwhen they�re jumping on the trampoline reciting the multiplication  <br/>\nfacts, or when they�re sitting with a workbook and memorizing flash  <br/>\ncards and that sort of thing?  What is the learning style?  What are  <br/>\nyour children�s goals? What do they want to accomplish with their  <br/>\nlife?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what a child&#39;s goals are or what they want to  <br/>\naccomplish.  Odds are they haven&#39;t thought about it, or if they  have  <br/>\nan idea or a plan it will change.  Marty used to want to be a police  <br/>\nofficer.  I treated it as a serious any-minute-now goal, but Keith  <br/>\nwanted  me to discourage it.  It didn&#39;t matter either way, except  <br/>\nthat with support and being treated as someone who had a possible  <br/>\nplan, it was all Marty&#39;s decision and doing when he changed his mind  <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter whether a particular kid learns better while  <br/>\njumping or humming or writing or listening to music, if you aren&#39;t in  <br/>\na hurry to stuff him with facts, and if you don&#39;t have rules against  <br/>\njumping, humming, writing or listening to music.  And it&#39;s really  <br/>\nnone of my business what my children&#39;s &quot;learning styles&quot; are.  That  <br/>\nconcept is probably twenty years old or more, and was all the rage  <br/>\namong educators for a while in the 1980&#39;s.  Most people learn  <br/>\ndifferent things different ways anyway, so if someone is &quot;a visual  <br/>\nlearner&quot; she won&#39;t learn from a headset and a droning voice.  But it  <br/>\nalso doesn&#39;t mean she will learn everything in the world if she can  <br/>\nsee pictures on paper.  She might learn NOTHING if she doesn&#39;t have  <br/>\nany idea what people are showing her pictures of, or why, or if she  <br/>\ncan&#39;t see the things in motion instead of flat and still, and  <br/>\nprobably EVERYone would do better if they could see a real example  <br/>\nand moving pictures and still pictures, and hear about it, and maybe  <br/>\nhear and touch and taste and smell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unschooling works no matter what &quot;learning style&quot; or eventual  <br/>\ngoals any child has.  Provide a rich environment and encouragement  <br/>\nand hang out with them to answer their questions and provide them  <br/>\nwith more stuff and ideas and they&#39;ll learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one part.  I might get to other parts.  It&#39;s kind of daunting  <br/>\nin its length, I agree with Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334795970,"authorName":"Dan Lake","from":"&quot;Dan Lake&quot; &lt;danthedad@...&gt;","profile":"dlake97124","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling and eclectic homeschooling expert","postDate":"1227732730","msgId":40577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2OTkzNTc4MDgxMTI2MTI1Mm01M2NlOWI3YW4yYTAzYTYxMzJlYTAwZTA0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdnamRsNitxcWc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdnamRsNitxcWc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40536,"nextInTopic":40585,"prevInTime":40576,"nextInTime":40578,"topicId":40536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s very long so I ll have to finish reading it tonight.
