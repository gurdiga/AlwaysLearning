He hoped the program would  <br/>\nbe big enough that he&#39;d become a specialist in something they really  <br/>\nneeded fixed or maintained in person. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I wanted to go into space.  I read lots about it,  <br/>\nand then it passed in favor of wanting to become a teacher, or a  <br/>\nmissionary, or a writer.   The last three urges have been satisfied  <br/>\nin one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are ways to encourage interests without funneling a kid  <br/>\ntoward a single point.  Balancing information with parallel, related  <br/>\nfields she might not have considered might be one way.  Marty has  <br/>\nconsidered police work, and is always aware of it out of the corner  <br/>\nof his eye.  I don&#39;t discourage him at all (though Keith wishes I  <br/>\nwould) but when things come up, that interest is a factor. Hard to  <br/>\nexplain.  When he was talking about maybe going to the university for  <br/>\na while, but still applying to the police academy when he&#39;s 21, we  <br/>\ntalked about what kinds of things might be helpful to take in two or  <br/>\nthree years even without a degree.  We talked about chemistry and  <br/>\nphysics, if he was interested in forensics; about sports and P.E.  <br/>\njust for general strength and stamina, to know more about how not to  <br/>\nget hurt being physical, and in case he wanted to be involved in the  <br/>\nPolice Athletic League.  But I&#39;ve kept the big door open to the  <br/>\npossibility that he&#39;ll do something altogether different that he  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t even considered  yet.  And he has noticed that the police cars  <br/>\nare parked in neighborhoods where the houses aren&#39;t very expensive  <br/>\n(city police take their cars home with them at night here), so they  <br/>\napparently don&#39;t make much money.   But those factors are neither  <br/>\n&quot;deciders&quot; nor paths he would have to back out of.  He wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\nwasting time or going down the wrong track or failing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the article about becoming president, there&#39;s this: &quot;So what IS a  <br/>\nworthy goal for us to set for our children? I heard about a family  <br/>\nwith a chart on the wall culminating in a scholarship to Notre Dame.  <br/>\nIt worked backwards into the present, so that if the child met all  <br/>\nthe lower-level goals, the scholarship was a done deal. The kid was  <br/>\nonly nine years old or so, and the parents had made the chart  <br/>\nthemselves, but hey! People need GOALS!! (In our collective defense,  <br/>\nthese people weren�t homeschooling.) What are their odds of failure?  <br/>\nA scholarship to Harvard would be a failure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd years back, when the AOL homeschooling forum was wildly active,  <br/>\nsomeone told a similar story, of a timeline in a child&#39;s room that  <br/>\nwent along two walls, and was a set of goals for a sport.  I think it  <br/>\nwas swimming, but it could&#39;ve been gymnastics (Nancy do you remember  <br/>\nthis story?) and it had the dates by which she needed to win regional  <br/>\nand state and national titles to go to the olympics or some such.   <br/>\nThe kid was youngish.  I really wish I had kept it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Would anyone happen to know..","postDate":"1147866064","msgId":25893,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERFRjc5RDVCLThFMDgtNEM3Ny04NDI4LTBEMTY1QTVGNEMwNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0ZTh1dSs0MWw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU0ZTh1dSs0MWw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25892,"nextInTopic":25894,"prevInTime":25892,"nextInTime":25894,"topicId":25875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
