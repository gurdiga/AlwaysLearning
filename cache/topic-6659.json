At a planning meeting, it was announced that<br/>\nmost of the moms wanted to splits with GS to go with a knock-off<br/>\nultra-conservative group because GS is too soft on &quot;the gay issue.&quot;  Many of<br/>\nthe moms talked about how offended they were by GS&#39;s stance on the topic.

However,<br/>\nwe continue to see these women and children at support group functions.<br/>\nAdriane and I both continue to be genuinely friendly.  I have had quite a<br/>\nfew cold shoulders from that circle but Adriane has faired better and is<br/>\nvery pleased with herself for making decisions that back up her morals.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who is also pretty proud of Adriane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6619,"nextTopicId":6537}}
