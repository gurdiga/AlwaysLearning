I didn&#39;t give birth to #3, so didn&#39;t have that pregnancy-and-recovery piece, but she seems to have responded to me being a &quot;replacement&quot; mom by deciding that I should hold her all the time, waking or sleeping, for the first three months of her life. David and I figure we did literally hold her (or have her in the sling) about 23 1/2 hours a day for those months. So I know a little bit about the challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as activities, depending on your energy level and motivation, you can either remind yourself that a baby in a sling is incredibly portable and just go do stuff anyway, or settle in to enjoying a quiet time with your kids. We watched a lot of movies together, played video games, played board games, and also went to some activities that we didn&#39;t want to miss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as thoughts, I would remind myself (and am doing so now, during an extended period of ill-health) that life is long and goes through seasons. You may have a time of lower activity for awhile, but as the baby gets older and you get your energy back, your life will become more active as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Sandra mentioned asking other moms for help. You may not have family in the area, but I have found that other moms involved in activities my kids are in are very happy to help out, especially when there&#39;s a new baby. Some people are actually flattered to be asked for help, because it says to them that you see them as a friend. I once had a woman gush about that to me when I asked her if she would come clean my bathroom, for heaven&#39;s sake, when we were moving into a new house and I was exhausted and overwhelmed and everything was covered with dust from having the floors redone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re involved in a local homeschool group at all, that can be a big source of help. I don&#39;t have a local unschoolers group, but I hang out with a mixed group, and they are like an army ready to mobilize when somebody has a baby or a husband having surgery or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my friends modeled a really wise behavior when they had their first baby: if people called and asked to come visit the baby, they would say, &quot;Sure, and can you just swing by the store and bring some diapers and a gallon of milk on your way?&quot; Or when people were there, they&#39;d say, &quot;Hey, would you mind emptying the wastebaskets while you&#39;re here?&quot; or sweeping the kitchen floor or whatever--these little five minute jobs that people are happy to do but that can really add up and feel overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric 8; Carl, almost 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling plus a newborn","postDate":"1268294689","msgId":51889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBMTNBNjBDLUU4RTAtNDNDOC1CNjgwLTVBRDMxRURDNjJENUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhuOWZnaytxOTJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhuOWZnaytxOTJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51881,"nextInTopic":51899,"prevInTime":51888,"nextInTime":51890,"topicId":51880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
