Why would anyone want to live on Beer and<br/>\n&gt; Twinkies?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 10yr old dd asked for Twinkies about a year ago, because she had<br/>\n&gt; eaten some somewhere else and wanted more, so I bought them and she<br/>\n&gt; ate one. The rest sat there in the box for a long time(they were not<br/>\n&gt; fit to eat)until I threw them away. She could have them anytime she<br/>\n&gt; wants, but passes them by at the store all the time. She sometimes<br/>\n&gt; gets on a powdered sugar donut binge, but after a while, that slows<br/>\n&gt; down on that, too. Everyone in our family loves chocolate and we<br/>\n&gt; have Ding Dongs in our pantry all the time and dd could have them any<br/>\n&gt; time she wants,but she has eaten maybe one in the last year. She<br/>\n&gt; loves that EZ-Cheese on scrabbled eggs and I tried to tell her one<br/>\n&gt; time that she shouldn&#39;t have it because I thought it was just like<br/>\n&gt; cholesterol in a can. She wanted eggs EVERDAY with EZ-CHEESE for a<br/>\n&gt; month. When she finally realized that I wasn&#39;t forbiding her to have<br/>\n&gt; it, she slowed down on it and went back to her powdered sugar donut<br/>\n&gt; binge.....hehehe!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beer....Wine....both have been offered to her, and she couldn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; past the smell...that may change someday, and I am so very thankful<br/>\n&gt; now that I don&#39;t have to bite my tongue while she has beer and<br/>\n&gt; twinkies on a daily basis. I might think of running from<br/>\n&gt; unschooling..hehehe!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She just has no desire to have things or binge on things, just<br/>\n&gt; because it is forbidden, because it&#39;s not forbidden.

There was an ongoing discussion there, which I linked in my own<br/>\nblogpost if anyone is interested. The blogger and I actually agree on<br/>\nmore than we disagree about, but she&#39;d posted some things about<br/>\n&quot;neglectful&quot; parenting and it riled me up a bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was said that if her child wanted nothing but beer and twinkies for<br/>\nbreakfast she&#39;d be a bad parent to let them have it. It was also<br/>\n&quot;neglectful&quot; to let your child&#39;s teeth rot, which we had an ongoing<br/>\nchallenge with Jalen about and I disagreed strongly with that point of<br/>\nview. Anyhoo, it&#39;s all there. I talked about my &quot;neglect&quot; by letting<br/>\nmy child choose and by NOT strapping him down in order to fix his<br/>\nteeth when I thought it was in his best interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want a bunch of people to go read the post and then go read<br/>\nat her blog and post a bunch of stuff. It&#39;s died, let it die. But it<br/>\ndoes make for interesting reading.

A friend of  <br/>\ntheirs once, for fun, talked several guys into pooling money to make  <br/>\na &quot;Twinkie Casserole.&quot;  Half of that fluffy mess stayed on our  <br/>\ncounter for a few days, and the leftover ingredients were there a  <br/>\nwhile, untouched.  Half a jar of marshmallow cream.  I&#39;d never owned  <br/>\nany before, my kids didn&#39;t want any, and after a year or so I threw  <br/>\nit away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last few things my kids have asked for from the store:  plums,  <br/>\napples, macaroni and cheese, pizza, milk and cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two girl scout cookies in a bowl in the fridge, open,  <br/>\nuntouched for days.
