I have been reading for years different philosophies in learning.  I think I thought I knew and agreed with unschooling, but could not put my finger on it exactly.  I would not claim it.  Now I get it.  My kids do not need me to make all the connections for them in learning.  They are allowed to make their own connections.  What they come up with has been more insightful then what I could &quot;teach&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA question I have (which may or may not be answerable) is what is something that has made unschooling great in your family?  What is something that you have done or tried that has not been helpful?  Thanks, Michal-mom of 3 boys</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56409,"nextTopicId":56466}}
