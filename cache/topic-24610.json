The weather is<br/>\ngloomy and some color would brighten their days.  Anyone who wants to send<br/>\nflowers can send them to her home:<br/>\n<br/>\n1218 South First Avenue<br/>\nSioux Falls, SD 57105<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, they are putting together a slideshow, and would appreciate people<br/>\nemailing any photos they would like to be included on the dvd to Karen<br/>\nBuxcel: buxcel@...<br/>\nI asked Kelli what we could do for Hayden. She feels very strongly<br/>\nthat the<br/>\ncomputer fund is the best thing we can do for him - that it&#39;s<br/>\nsomething that<br/>\nwould really bring him joy.  So anything that can be done as far as<br/>\nspreading the word about and contributing to the fundraising site<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dianasheart.com/)\">http://www.dianasheart.com/)</a> will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\nOne idea Kathryn and I had for the NE conference was the possibility of<br/>\nrunning a $10/ticket raffle.  My first thought was that maybe we could put<br/>\ntogether another quilt. Unfortunately I&#39;m useless with a needle, so this<br/>\nidea would require a volunteer to put the quilt together.  If anyone would<br/>\nbe willing to volunteer or has another idea for something we could raffle,<br/>\nplease let us know.<br/>\n~Rue</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24608,"nextTopicId":24611}}
