I<br/>\n                              think there are<br/>\na couple of things.

And the way that you do that is you<br/>\nhave to, I<br/>\n                              think, be<br/>\npretty patient as a parent. We know that kids<br/>\ninitially reject<br/>\n                              a lot of new<br/>\nfoods unless they&#39;re sweet or salty, and it&#39;s<br/>\nonly with<br/>\n                              repeated<br/>\npresentations, non-coercive presentations,<br/>\nthat kids learn<br/>\n                              to eat a lot of<br/>\nthose foods.<br/>\n<br/>\n                              ALAN ALDA<br/>\n(NARRATION) Without that kind of perceptive<br/>\nparenting,<br/>\n                              our kids are<br/>\ncaught in two terrible traps. First we say<br/>\nfinish your<br/>\n                              food, then we<br/>\nput too much food on the plate. Then we say<br/>\nthat high<br/>\n                              fat, high<br/>\ncalorie snack foods are forbidden -- so kids<br/>\nwant to binge<br/>\n                              on them. But it<br/>\ngets worse. Take a look at our next story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK there is a LOT more, and it&#39;s really<br/>\ninterestinga nd worth going to read, but the<br/>\npoint is, I wonder if for kids who are<br/>\nforbidden something, that they want it more.<br/>\nEven if it&#39;s tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, my son has is spirited and<br/>\n&gt; passionate, easily<br/>\n&gt; overstimulated by environments that are<br/>\n&gt; chaotic or noisy and hyper.  My<br/>\n&gt; instincts are that he is better off without<br/>\n&gt; tv for quite some time<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But what does he think? What is his opinion?<br/>\nYou say below he is verbal--I&#39;m sure he has<br/>\nan opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (videos<br/>\n&gt; too, except we do view our family life<br/>\n&gt; videos on our computer, because it is<br/>\n&gt; real to us and helps us enjoy our past and<br/>\n&gt; present.)  I may add he is also<br/>\n&gt; very verbal, surprisingly early, and loves<br/>\n&gt; to converse, is very social with<br/>\n&gt; strangers and friends and seems to enjoy<br/>\n&gt; his life very much.  He is<br/>\n&gt; sensitive to the feelings of others, and<br/>\n&gt; easily concerned if he hears<br/>\n&gt; another child crying, wanting to help or<br/>\n&gt; get him help.  I feel good about<br/>\n&gt; his little person and I think he does too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:-)  you obviously love him very much.  You<br/>\ndescribe my children too, and they watch tv.<br/>\nhmmm maybe it&#39;s not the tv so much but the<br/>\nparent.  (can I blame it on me?) or maybe<br/>\nit&#39;s just the kid?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel good about protecting his<br/>\n&gt; innocence and childhood at this time in his<br/>\n&gt; life.  Childhood is short, life<br/>\n&gt; compartively long, plenty of time to add<br/>\n&gt; vices, but hard to learn what life<br/>\n&gt; would be like without them once vice is<br/>\n&gt; established.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to protect my children&#39;s innocence<br/>\ntoo.  I want them to be kids.  We, my kids<br/>\nand I, talk about this a lot.  I don&#39;t forbid<br/>\nLexie to watch things, but I do highly<br/>\nsuggest that something isn&#39;t appropriate for<br/>\na six year old. However, on occassion I have<br/>\nlet her watch something I felt was not<br/>\nappropriate.  A good example of this was the<br/>\nshow that came on after star trek.  She<br/>\nwatched it 3-4 times, it&#39;s like a cross<br/>\nbetween a cop show and the x files, can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the name. Anyway, on the 5th or so<br/>\nshow, she got scared!  She has not watched it<br/>\nsince and she&#39;s more willing to listen to me<br/>\nwhen I say something isn&#39;t appropriate.  I<br/>\nalso came intot he room and she was reading<br/>\none of my holocaust books.  She is six, and I<br/>\njust am not ready for her to go there.  I<br/>\nasked her to trust me on this and wait.  She<br/>\nsaid ok. Id idn&#39;t move the books or box them<br/>\nup or get rid of them. They are still<br/>\navailable to her.  But because I trust her<br/>\nand she trusts me, I don&#39;t think she will<br/>\nread them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone on this list wants our<br/>\nchildren to loose their innocence<br/>\nprematurely, I think we (or me, I should only<br/>\nspeak for myself) are working hard at seeing<br/>\nour children as independent beings with<br/>\nwonderful minds and the ability to make<br/>\nchoices for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your civil discourse during this<br/>\n&gt; thread, I appreciate the ability<br/>\n&gt; to discuss different choices without<br/>\n&gt; feeling or feeling the need to be<br/>\n&gt; arguementative.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but sometimes I like to argue.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Terrie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            Yahoo!

Do you think if your child had more exposure to tv he would stay mesmerized all the time by it? Or do you think that because it was so &#39;new&#39; to him it was a source of fascination? I liken it to when I am on a &#39;diet&#39;..When I am, and I try to &#39;limit&#39; my sweets/fats, anytime I am around something sweet (chocolate is the worst!!) or fattening (French fries!!!) I almost feel like I HAVE to have them..It&#39;s a craving!  But, when I am not on a &#39;diet&#39; when I am just eating what I want and not counting calories or fat, then my consumption of those things are very easily limited..I can say &quot;Nah I dont feel like that right now&quot; much easier in those situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if that analogy is making sense, but do you think it&#39;s possible that by limiting the TV you will find that when the time comes for you and you DO introduce it, it will be something your son will want almost constantly because it is &#39;special&#39; and &#39;new&#39;? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd do you think that you will follow this type of an example for a lot of other things in your family&#39;s life? (Ie you decide whether or not it should be introduced and when, and set those limits for your son?) If so, what types of things do you see this being the &#39;norm&#39; for?<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free if you&#39;d like to continue this with me offlist if it would be more comfortable for you, I am enjoying our exchange as well but dont want you to feel like you are having to argue your points with anyone in order to answer my questions honestly =).<br/>\n<br/>\nNichoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFertility Friend Online Support Guide <br/>\nNow you CAN conceive online..<br/>\nwww.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Abrahamson, Daniel & Teresa <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, January 28, 2002 8:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: Any other families without a TV Re: [AlwaysLearning]TV,Videoand unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichoel:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I cannot recall if I included this, but we have plans to at some point when<br/>\n  the time instinctively feels right, to include media such as televison,<br/>\n  because of several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that it is<br/>\n  not avoidable in the wide world, and one needs to be educated about the<br/>\n  effects of media, the power it can have, and the lack of reality of much of<br/>\n  it.  Also, I expect to enjoy with him, at the appropriate time, films and<br/>\n  video that add  dimension  to learning about the world at large.  However at<br/>\n  a young age, I think he has enough important things to learn about his<br/>\n  little world he lives in and that is best done through his experiences with<br/>\n  his world, friends, environment etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son has had a few unplanned tv viewings, and I was distressed by the<br/>\n  memorized state he went in to, and he wanted to be 1 inch away from it the<br/>\n  entire time.  Also, my son has is spirited and passionate, easily<br/>\n  overstimulated by environments that are chaotic or noisy and hyper.  My<br/>\n  instincts are that he is better off without tv for quite some time (videos<br/>\n  too, except we do view our family life videos on our computer, because it is<br/>\n  real to us and helps us enjoy our past and present.)  I may add he is also<br/>\n  very verbal, surprisingly early, and loves to converse, is very social with<br/>\n  strangers and friends and seems to enjoy his life very much.  He is<br/>\n  sensitive to the feelings of others, and easily concerned if he hears<br/>\n  another child crying, wanting to help or get him help.  I feel good about<br/>\n  his little person and I think he does too.  I feel good about protecting his<br/>\n  innocence and childhood at this time in his life.  Childhood is short, life<br/>\n  compartively long, plenty of time to add vices, but hard to learn what life<br/>\n  would be like without them once vice is established.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your civil discourse during this thread, I appreciate the ability<br/>\n  to discuss different choices without feeling or feeling the need to be<br/>\n  arguementative.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Terrie <br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
