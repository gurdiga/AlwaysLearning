Her husband who I <br/>\nnever really met though he met me when I was little was Papa.  When my neice <br/>\nwas born My mother insisted on being called Grammi and it stuck just fine.  <br/>\nShe decided to have grandkids call my dad Papa but he&#39;s never really liked <br/>\nit.  So he&#39;s been pretty much whatever you wanted to call him.  Some 14 <br/>\nyears later a different neice came along and started saying Grammi and <br/>\nGrampy which has evolved into Grammi and Grumpy which is painfully fitting <br/>\nand which he actually really likes.  LOL  My husbands father is Grampa Phil.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I want to be a Nana like my Nana.  By I also like the korean word <br/>\nfor grandma (DH is Korean) Which ends up sounding like Harmony with a slight <br/>\nL sound on the R. (kinda like Ha-lra-mo-nee)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when my first neice started talking she had a close relationship with <br/>\nmy sister Alicia.  She would call her Annalicia (Aunt Alicia all strung <br/>\ntogether).  So when she first said my name she called me Annakatie.  It was <br/>\ncute and fun for many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
