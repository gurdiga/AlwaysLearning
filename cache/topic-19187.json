Such programs seemingly exist for college-<br/>\nbound high school students who seek to out-wit the competition when <br/>\ntheir fate is determined at college admissions time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the early college programs that this writer noticed in the <br/>\nbook are: &quot;Introduction to Computer Integrated Surgery&quot; at Johns <br/>\nHopkins&#39;s &quot;Hopkins Precollege Program;&quot; the &quot;International Relations <br/>\nProgram for High School Students&quot; at Georgetown; and, Cornell <br/>\nUniversity Summer College&#39;s &quot;Exploration in Architecture.&quot; In a <br/>\nworkable way, the editor has arranged these and hundreds of other <br/>\nearly college programs into 80 career-oriented categories such <br/>\nas &quot;Toward the Making of a Surgeon,&quot; &quot;Toward the Making of a <br/>\nDiplomat,&quot; &quot;Toward the Making of an Architect,&quot; and &quot;Toward the <br/>\nMaking of a Filmmaker.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile some, or even many, of these early college programs have long <br/>\nbeen known to college counselors and students at elite secondary <br/>\nschools like Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles or Georgetown Day <br/>\nSchool in Washington, D.C., the structure of EARLY COLLEGE PROGRAMS <br/>\nattempts to appeal to virtually all college-bound high school <br/>\nstudents in all income brackets. For example, there is a special <br/>\nsection for students interested in early college programs at <br/>\nprofessional art schools, and yet another for students wishing to <br/>\nattend an early college program at one of the U.S. military <br/>\nacademies; in other words, a high school stint at either the Rhode <br/>\nIsland School of Design or West Point can look pretty impressive <br/>\n(perhaps extremely so) at college application time. Further, one can <br/>\ngo all out and spend thousands of dollars to attend <br/>\nStanford&#39;s &quot;Summer College for High School Students,&quot; or opt for the <br/>\none-week, &quot;All Girls-All Math&quot; program at the University of Nebraska <br/>\nat Lincoln for just a hundred bucks. Importantly, information on <br/>\navailable scholarships, as well as a special section for <br/>\nunderrepresented youth, is included in the book, too. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe helpful part of the book might be the &quot;Toward the Making of a <br/>\n[enter your career here].&quot;  If you put it on your site, you might <br/>\nfocus on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis review is definitely written with a schooly perspective (outwit <br/>\nthe competition -- bah), but I could see this helping the unschooled <br/>\nteen who really knows what they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] advice on listing this?","postDate":"1080852528","msgId":19195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5LjNlNzZlMTY0LjJkOWRkYTMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19192,"nextInTopic":19196,"prevInTime":19194,"nextInTime":19196,"topicId":19187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/1/2004 10:03:18 AM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: Good.
