My oldest, 8 now, has an ability to take all of my energy. She has a<br/>\ncup which no matter how much I fill with love, still always seems empty to<br/>\nher. I can spend all day and night with her engaged and she still needs more.<br/>\nI have 2 other kids, 6 and 3 now who I feel for because Ashley needs so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nI too have wondered is there something else going on. So far I feel she is<br/>\nthriving and I have not gone to any specialists. She has her deal about<br/>\nclothing. Only inside out satin these days. Only 1 pair of sandals. She has<br/>\nhad these traits off and on her whole life. She wears a bathing suit for<br/>\nunderclothes and sleeps naked. She is obsessed to me with how clothes feel.<br/>\nShe finds problems not solutions. I&#39;m learning not to react. Sandra showed me<br/>\nhow to continue loving her. I hold this 75 lb baby and sing her songs I did in<br/>\nthe sling. I even brought her sling out and wrap her in it. I tell her about<br/>\nher baby self and have made memory pages for her for her own books. She can be<br/>\nvery unlovable during a clothing tantrum. She yells alot too, over simple<br/>\nthings. Big frustrations. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I had all three asleep after a day at the beach. Ashley woke<br/>\nand was very needy. I was very needy too. After 1 1/2 hours driving I wanted<br/>\ntime to be with myself and hubby. I was feeling icky having a tantrumy kid<br/>\nwhen I expected 3 kids asleep and time with Tim. I asked Tim to join us and we<br/>\nboth sat with Ashley. Her feet were not right, too dry she said. So there we<br/>\nwere, all three of us, Ashley with her feet in a bucket of water at 10pm.<br/>\nSomething Tim said got her mood switched and we had a few giggles and instead<br/>\nof whimpering Ashley waking the babies, she went off to sleep alone. I also<br/>\ngot to have Tim with me while dealing with an unpleasant childen. Very<br/>\nsupportive and I&#39;m going to try this same angle again.<br/>\n<br/>\n I so get tired of parenting alone waiting to be with Tim. I have had to pull<br/>\nhim in, let him know I like being with him with the kids. Still romantic, like<br/>\na date in public. The loving feelings can flow. He connects with the child and<br/>\nwith me. I can not believe how easy we get into 1 parent with the children, 1<br/>\nparent getting time to do chores, personal stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the side, Ashley got her ears pierced yesterday.
