I said if that would be better we could provide money to help them with groceries and he could live there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I felt better letting him know there might actually be options.  Then when he was calmer he felt a bit that he was choosing to stay home—choosing not to pursue those options.  And he probably thought about them, and decided it wasn’t so bad where he was (compared to the nearish and stated alternatives).  At the same time, I tried to amend the factors that were frustrating him (sometimes having to do with younger siblings, or scheduling, or something I could help with to stave off a future problem).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone feels stuck or crowded or powerless in some aspect, the pressure can build up and blast out in a seemingly unrelated direction.  Rather than accepting the blow-ups, backing up to what happened before that might help.  Hunger?  Lack of sleep?

I&#39;d like to clarify and offer some more info; from the responses to my post, I think maybe I didn&#39;t include enough info. When my own nervous system is hyper-aroused and I&#39;m having huge feelings, I sometimes have thoughts similar to the ones my son expresses when he&#39;s angry. I don&#39;t say them aloud, though, and I am quickly able to shift my perspective from that level of negativity. He is less able to do that, at age 8, than I am at age 38.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">When he&#39;s happy, he readily expresses how much he loves his life and he often tells my husband and me how much he loves us. Words do matter, and we often respond to his angry expression with &quot;I love you even when you&#39;re feeling hateful&quot; or something akin to that. He knows his words have an affect on others but talking at any length to him when he is flooded with big feelings is not helpful. Later, when he&#39;s calm, we sometimes talk about it while we are snuggling or playing but not every time. Sometimes, we answer with something very absurd and silly and it helps us move to a less negative space.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>My 10 year old has occasionally said similar things when she is very upset but very rarely these days...it was something she did more when she was younger.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Clarissa</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632890898ygroups-quoted\"><br><br>---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote :<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1632890898ygrps-yiv-2065388367\">-=--I think this is possibly a jump to conclusions without knowing more about the child or that family&#39;s dynamics. -=-<br>\n<br>\nPossibly, but I don’t think so.<br>\n<br>\n-=-I think this is possibly a jump to conclusions without knowing more about the child or that family&#39;s dynamics.

My kid loves his life and says so all the time. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this about a child who loves his life and says so all the time?<br/>\nThat cannot also be a child who says “I hate you” (to a parent) and “My life sucks.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nImportant detail:  <br/>\n-=- While most of our experiences have been good ones, we&#39;ve had a couple of coaches &quot;with the boys will be boys&quot; attitude.  Thus I instantly had to turn myself into a hovercraft, hanging around the dugout and needing to support him. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou did not “instantly have to” but you chose to.  If you’re thinking, and writing, and posting “have to” you’re not looking at choices.

Anyway, from watching some of these YouTube gamers he began to gain a language that helped him navigate these situations. &nbsp;He&#39;s developed a sort of &quot;spice&quot; that he has woven into his being, which allows him to remain his sweet laid back self, but also let kids know when he needs to that he is not to be messed with. &nbsp;He is respectful and clear and holds his space powerfully.

His anger is expressed with &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;My life sucks&quot; and he often has a negative first reaction to new situations. Watching his favorite YouTubers has been impactful in him handling his big feelings and reactions. They definitely still occur, but more and more often, he is willing and able to think of a situation in which Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Jack Septiceye (among others) handled a tough situation and to consider it. Recently, he was watching a YouTuber (his name is Corey but I can&#39;t think of the name of his channel) who moved to Alaska with his girlfriend and was experiencing somewhat of a culture shock.

It wasn&#39;t working, and after a while I lost my cool.  I yelled him that he needed to stop immediately.  He did.  I shocked him, and the rage ended immediately and he was able to move into a calmer form of being upset. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think an honest angry response from someone who IS usually able to choose how to act can be powerful.  It’s reasonable, too. People DO get tired of over-the-top responses from a person.  And when a family pretends that bad behavior is okay, they become part of the problem.  By that I don’t mean that they should always point out the bad behavior, but neither should they say “No problem” about it.    Faking anger, or yelling in a cold-blooded attempt to shock a person isn’t the same as what’s described above—attempts to be calming, and then a loud exasperation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it has affected his friendships.  He is a child I have worked with since he was young on developing social skills to get along with other kids.  Other kids want to play games, and he gets upset if he doesn&#39;t get his way or he loses.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while, could you provide or recommend activities all the friends would enjoy that are less competitive?  Or maybe have a code word with your son so that if he’s getting angry, you can call him away from the game for a moment? And if calling him away from the game turns into you apologizing to the other kids and asking them if they want to finish the game without him, still it might save him some friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few years when we avoided playing games with Kirby—when  he was 8, 9, maybe 10.  I would say I didn’t want to play if he was going to be angry about it.  So sometimes I gave him another chance and sometimes we ended the game early.  He didn’t want us to cheat to let him win.  He didn’t want Holly (five years younger than he is) to “play wrong.”  I used to let Holly make whatever move she wanted, on her turn, when she was too little to play, and even if it didn’t affect the other plays, it bothered him.  He wanted everyone to play right, and full-on, AND for him to be the winner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe dice games would help a bit—dice can’t be controlled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing we did with good benefit a few times was to play on teams, so that the adult on his team could comment on the likelihood of the next move, or discuss options for their team, and then voice “the team”’s response.  Kind of modelling better behavior, and partly keeping the emotion spread out and not focussed in one dangerous beam.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also helped him see when he was getting angry, and to help him breathe or stand up and stretch or something, to relax and let the adrenaline subside.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Kirby grew up to be a facilitator of other people’s gaming—was a Pokemon Gym Leader in the early card-tournament days, after he had played the game for a year or so at various book stores and gaming shops he was asked to oversee the game at a gaming shop, when he was 13.  They hired him when he was 14, so he was getting paid, and he went on to help organize and judge Magic the Gathering tournaments, and other Collectible Card events.  Later, he was a gamemaster for World of Warcraft, and was promoted to help train, oversee and encourage other gamemasters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo an intense interest in games, even in a kid who’s volatile, still might be the beginning of a life of peaceful gaming. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: child crying and screaming when losing a game or video game","postDate":"1472202136","msgId":77414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDOUQ0OTRBLTY0Q0QtNDI2MS05MDU4LTJBM0UyMUE2RjVFNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTTZBM04xZXNadGtNRDhaQm5hQnoyWEhaZjBVMDQyOHhhcHdWdFJnOEUrNUpOOGJRQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNDMDFCM0FFLUY2NzYtNDhDQS05RjRDLTczRTgyQTFENUJBRkB5YWhvby5jb20+IDxDQU02QTNOMWVzWnRrTUQ4WkJuYUJ6MlhIWmYwVTA0Mjh4YXB3VnRSZzhFKzVKTjhiUUFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77413,"nextInTopic":77415,"prevInTime":77413,"nextInTime":77415,"topicId":77402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My mother despised Pokemon and didn t hesitate to say so at length, so I grew up thinking that only stupid, uncreative people could possibly like it.

When she was younger she behaved much like your son does with win/lose games.   My own family - I mean myself, my parents and siblings -  are very British middle class, and we go to great lengths to hide our emotions and feelings.  That stiff upper lip thing ;)    My husband&#39;s family are not like that at all, they tend to shout and throw and kick things when they are angry.   I suspect that truly good mental health exists somewhere between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to help my daughter find ways to react less, or to hide her reactions.  She is very in touch with her emotions and likes to talk about them and analyse them.  She eventually told me that our attempts to help her hide her frustration at losing made her feel like we were asking her to not &#39;just be herself&#39;.    Like we wanted her to be someone different.  It seemed to me she was describing the &#39;authentic self&#39; that so many people who write about mental health talk about.  And our attempts to get her to tone down the volume on her emotions were perceived by her as denying her authentic self.   We continued to talk about these things over the years, but more about the concepts, not about her own behaviour, as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one time she had been playing cards at her Grandma&#39;s house, and her Grandparents had talked to her about the concept of a &#39;poker face&#39;, and had tried to encourage her to develop a poker face.   At their house she politely declined, saying she didn&#39;t think it was right to cover up her feelings to that extent.  Her Grandparents were struck by how fluently she talked and thought about the concept, but they were also completely nonplussed by how firmly she was convinced that a poker face was not for her.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have lost a couple of friends partly because of this issue along the way.  But discussing it with my daughter enabled me to realise that I also felt somewhat stifled and on edge with these particular friends.   Letting these friends drift away has actually left us happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays my daughter avoids playing certain types of games with certain types of people.   She also has a punch bag, stress balls and other physical outlets for when her feelings are too big for her to contain them.   She has learned how to distract herself with movies, music or running around the garden when she starts feeling overwhelmed with her emotions and doesn&#39;t want to actually get upset.   Equally, sometimes, she allows herself to get upset, and lets it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"","from":"semajrak@...","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: child crying and screaming when losing a game or video game","postDate":"1472160639","msgId":77406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5wbm8xdisxN3BsZnMxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5wZ3Qzbytlc2s3ZmVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5wZ3Qzbytlc2s3ZmVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77405,"nextInTopic":77407,"prevInTime":77405,"nextInTime":77407,"topicId":77402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Then, I won without really trying to, and he got very upset with yelling, screaming, and clear actions of anger with screaming through gritted teeth,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1353387208\"><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">***Then, I won without really trying to, and he got very upset with yelling, screaming, and clear actions of anger with screaming through gritted teeth, strained and red face, banging his fist in his hands or on the table, and trying to reset the game so he could try to win instead.***</span><br style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;\">In the moment I would clearly say &quot;Stop. &nbsp;That&#39;s not okay.&quot;

A couple of years ago she was having a tough time with the game Octodad and raging off and on throughout the day. Since it was because she was stuck at one particular point in the game, I looked up some lets plays to see how to get past that point. We watched a Markiplier letsplay, which did indeed help her get past the hard part, but to my surprise, it helped her deal with her emotions. She began imitating his reactions. Raging, but in a funny way, laughing at herself or the situation. The more Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, etc. videos she watched, the more tools she had to deal with her emotions. I guess it helps seeing how older, more experienced gamers deal with the frustration that can come up.

After all it&#39;s supposed to be enjoyable for both people when playing a game. Be honest with him about how it makes you feel, &quot;the loud yelling/screaming doesn&#39;t make me feel good, it&#39;s scares me or hurts my ears&quot; or words to those effect, instead of the focus being on him and changing him, let it instead be on how to makes you feel.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></div><span style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\">&quot;I want him to have this fun resource, but my patience is worn down from the yelling and screaming, and I don&#39;t know how to help him any more&quot;.&nbsp;</span><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\">Telling him he has a problem that he needs help with may be getting him stuck and obsessed about fixing himself (eg sticky tape on mouth).&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\">Maybe have a chat about being aware of others in the family, how it interrupts the household calmness for you or others when he yells and you are not expecting it.</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);\"><span style=\"\">Hope something here helps.&nbsp;</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-948699122AppleMailSignature\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-948699122AppleMailSignature\">Sarah</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-948699122AppleMailSignature\"><br></div>Sent from my iPhone</div><div><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 23 Aug 2016, at 4:44 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tanyaz1@...\">tanyaz1@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type=\"cite\">This afternoon when he got upset that I won the Connect4 game, I was trying to stay present with him and help him calm down. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t working, and after a while I lost my cool. &nbsp;I yelled him that he needed to stop immediately.</blockquote></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414534980,"authorName":"","from":"tanyaz1@...","profile":"tanyaziegler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"child crying and screaming when losing a game or video game","postDate":"1471936440","msgId":77402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5wZ3Qzbytlc2s3ZmVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77403,"prevInTime":77401,"nextInTime":77403,"topicId":77402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thought there were, and I ve been searching for, previous threads about helping kids who get very upset about losing games.

This was when he said he just hates losing so much and it makes him angry. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The other day, we had a plumber here, and my son was playing his football game while the plumber was here without a peep. &nbsp;He may have taken a break at one point before he got upset; but as soon as the plumber left, he resumed his game, and the yelling and crying started again.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So these examples tell me he can control the anger for a short time, but then it will burst up if he doesn&#39;t walk away. &nbsp;He has told me other times that he figured out that if he pretends to be the game announcer / commentator when he&#39;s playing Madden, then that helps him to not get angry because his role is more neutral even though he&#39;s actually controlling one team. &nbsp;Another time he has put tape on his mouth to help as a physical reminder to not yell and cry - totally his idea. &nbsp;So he&#39;s working on it, and he has had some little successes, but I&#39;m wearing down and&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;\">it has affected his friendships. &nbsp;He is a child I have worked with since he was young on developing social skills to get along with other kids. &nbsp;Other kids want to play games, and he gets upset if he doesn&#39;t get his way or he loses. &nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p>And, honestly, it&#39;s getting really old to listen to all the time in the house with the video game playing. &nbsp;He is REALLY into tackle football right now. &nbsp;It has been a pleasure to watch the learning dance he has done around this new interest of his, and he really wants to play Madden and it&#39;s helping him to learn the game. &nbsp;I want him to have this fun resource, but my patience is worn down from the yelling and screaming, and I don&#39;t know how to help him any more. &nbsp;(My husband&#39;s patience is even thinner.) &nbsp;At one point, I asked my husband to take away the college football game because my son was really having a hard time with it. &nbsp;He was told that he could have it back after a few days if he thought he could play it without yelling and crying. &nbsp;I know it was a punishment, but I needed a break. &nbsp;He&#39;s been told he can only be allowed to play it if he can seem to be able to handle it. &nbsp;If not, then he&#39;s not ready to play it. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>On a side note, his dad has a similar history. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t play board games very often because he can&#39;t stand to lose either. &nbsp;He used to angrily shout while playing video games, but doesn&#39;t really do that any more. &nbsp;The first year I knew him, he flipped a checker board in a bit of anger because he thought I was going to win. &nbsp;I was so shocked, it seemed to come out of nowhere. &nbsp;So we don&#39;t play board games, other than once in a great while we will play as a family. &nbsp;He pretty much says he hates board games though. &nbsp;The other night, my son talked him into playing Connect4. &nbsp;The first game, my son was winning. &nbsp;My husband was trying to end the game prematurely stating no one would win. &nbsp;I suggested they play it out because I saw that my son could force a win. &nbsp;My husband dumped the checkers instead of giving my son the opportunity to play his winning piece. &nbsp;I left to run errands, and my son told me that they continued playing and my son won 5 games, and my husband won 4 games. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I admit I have a big fear that it&#39;s possible my son will not outgrow this because his dad hasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how else to help him or if what I&#39;m doing is having any effect. &nbsp;</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77409,"nextTopicId":77473}}
