And not always night.<br/>\nJanuary 12, 1989, 40 hours of labor started.

Kirby went to the best cake shop in town to get him  a <br/>\ncake.  It said &quot;Marty Sucks,&quot; and had beautiful blue roses all  around.<br/>\n <br/>\nMarty&#39;s sitting right here, playing Halo II with eight guys, one of whom he  <br/>\nknows. Having a good time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really like Marty.
