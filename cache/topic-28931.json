I have an online business (bloggingwithflair.com) and I&#39;m writing a <br/>\nbook this year. My children are 11, 9, 6, and 2. I had a lot of time <br/>\nthat needed to be devoted to the business start up but it&#39;s starting to <br/>\nfall into a sort of routine now. First and foremost, I could NOT do this <br/>\nunless I was unschooling. We need all areas of our lives to be flexible <br/>\nand &quot;tidal&quot;. In the morning I check on the needs of  my clients, then <br/>\nduring the baby&#39;s nap I put in two hours of web work. I do the bulk of <br/>\nmy work when my husband gets home, for an hour before dinner and then <br/>\nseveral afterwards. I&#39;m strict about two things: mornings through noon <br/>\nare sacred &quot;kid and house&quot; times (will rarely even answer the phone) and <br/>\nI always stop early enough to have some wind down time with my husband <br/>\n(usually 45 min or so on weeknights). We eat all three meals together <br/>\nbecause he comes home for lunch. Saturdays I usually work half a day; <br/>\nthat is when I write. I do the housework during the week so it&#39;s clean <br/>\nfor the weekend and other than my work time, we spend the rest of it <br/>\nrelaxing, hiking, swimming, church going, and just being together as a <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to work fast, to know how to multi-task, and when to set a firm <br/>\nboundary that can&#39;t be crossed. There are times when certain things just <br/>\nmust have a high level of respect. I try to be *in* the moment as much <br/>\nas possible. When I can&#39;t remember what needs doing next, I meditate, <br/>\nwhich always helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t struggle with guilt other than sometimes I feel stretched a <br/>\nlittle thin. I wish there was more of me to go around! When that gets <br/>\nfeeling really strong, dh helps me to step back and just focus on one <br/>\nthing, which is usually doing something fun and relaxing with the <br/>\nkids.... no housework, no computer, an easy meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings and Onward~ Tia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGold Standard wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ********Who else out there is self employed in doing what they love<br/>\n&gt; whilst<br/>\n&gt; unschooling their kids?

I have been wanting, trying to stop <br/>\nworking full-time but I grew up with little more often then with <br/>\nmore. I am scared about going back there and I do not want my kids to <br/>\nexperience that. I thought that because my mom watched Jade and Dylan <br/>\nthey were free to be and that it was going to meet everyone&#39;s needs <br/>\nbut even though it sounded great in my head it feels wrong.

Unschooling has changed us a lot <br/>\nand everyday I see something I could do different to make them smile. <br/>\nRealizing that I was putting my security before my kid&#39;s security <br/>\nmade me feel really bad but it also was the final straw. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to thank all those who share the lives with me it helps me <br/>\nmake connections and creates a better life for our family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ********Who else out there is self employed in doing what they love <br/>\n&gt; whilst<br/>\n&gt; unschooling their kids?

Those are the people I need to hear from as we are<br/>\n&gt; in the same boat!***********<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I groom dogs, am the director of a state homeschool accountability <br/>\n&gt; association, and coordinate the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>\nConference. <br/>\n&gt; None is full-time, but all are time-consuming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My children are older: 19 and 11. When Duncan was littler, I gave <br/>\nup <br/>\n&gt; the conference one year because it was just taking too much time <br/>\naway <br/>\n&gt;  from the family. We&#39;re all older (and more experienced) now. They <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt; understand the importance of what I do (all three businesses), and <br/>\nthey <br/>\n&gt; get something out of each one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Generally I work early morning or late at night. My husband, Ben, <br/>\n&gt; leaves each morning at 6:00. I&#39;m usually up by 7:00. Duncan doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; usually get up until about 10:00-ish. Cameron sleeps until 10-ish <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; later too, unless he needs to be at work earlier---but then, he&#39;s <br/>\ngone. <br/>\n&gt; So I get a few hours each morning when the boys are asleep/gone. <br/>\nBen <br/>\n&gt; goes to bed around 9:30; Cameron, at 10:00-ish; and Duncan usually <br/>\n&gt; between midnight and 1:00am ( Late nights are his favorite time for <br/>\n&gt; gaming; butwhen he has a friend over---like tonight---they are out <br/>\non <br/>\n&gt; the trampoline looking at the stars and talking until about <br/>\nmidnight). <br/>\n&gt; He almost always stays up one half hour later than I do---I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow <br/>\n&gt; why. He just likes a little alone time after the rest of us are in <br/>\nbed. <br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt; So I have a few hours each evening too when the boys are asleep <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; occupied.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I schedule all my groom dogs for early mornings (it&#39;s cooler that <br/>\nway <br/>\n&gt; too!), so generally I&#39;m done by the time they wake up (unless Cam <br/>\nhas <br/>\n&gt; to work early). I work out in the garage, so they know where to <br/>\nfind me <br/>\n&gt; if they need me. All my groom clients know that my kids come first, <br/>\nso <br/>\n&gt; I schedule dogs around my kids and our activities. Plus, although I <br/>\ntry <br/>\n&gt; to get dogs out as quickly as possible, I try to be sure to pad my <br/>\n&gt; schedule---just in case the boys need me for something or I get a <br/>\nphone <br/>\n&gt; call or whatever---I hate to rush through a dog.  OH! And I believe <br/>\n&gt; seriously in work smarter, not harder! I price myself at the upper <br/>\nend <br/>\n&gt; of the market, so I get 2-3 times what other groomers get. Fewer <br/>\ndogs, <br/>\n&gt; more $$$. Dog money is fun money! &lt;G&gt; So we use it to buy new games <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; go out to eat (it bought a praying mantis chrysalis, a bunch of <br/>\nladybug <br/>\n&gt; larvae, some caterpillars, and a microscope two weeks ago &lt;g&gt;). The <br/>\n&gt; boys like when I have a dog or two in the morning! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other two, the accountability association and the conference, <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; kind of seasonal---concentrated in a few weeks throughout the year. <br/>\n&gt; Again, the boys are very generous with me because they know <br/>\nunschooling <br/>\n&gt; can make such a difference in other children&#39;s lives. If they ever <br/>\nsaid <br/>\n&gt; (even hinted!) that it was too much or too hard on the family, I <br/>\nwould <br/>\n&gt; dump the conference and the association---in a heartbeat!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really high energy, so I do a LOT each day; but I try to keep <br/>\n&gt; business separate from my time with the boys. I also try to <br/>\nschedule my <br/>\n&gt; own hobbies around them during the day---I garden while the boys <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; swimming (or early in the morning while they&#39;re sleeping). I read <br/>\nemail <br/>\n&gt; early and late and keep the computer on during the day so that I <br/>\ncan <br/>\n&gt; check in several times/day in 3-4 minute spurts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We usually cook together &#39;cause both boys love to cook. Most of the <br/>\n&gt; cleaning gets done in many small bursts through out the day---plus <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt; have someone come clean every other week. THAT helps a lot because <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt; all clean for the maid! &lt;G&gt; Beds get stripped monthly, and toys and <br/>\n&gt; books and games get picked up at a minimum of every other week so <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt; Sandy can find the floor to vacuum. She scours the bathrooms and <br/>\n&gt; kitchen, mops and vacuums all floors, and dusts every little thing <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; the house---makes my life sooo much easier! And everyone <br/>\nappreciates <br/>\n&gt; the clean house after Sandy leaves, so they don&#39;t mind making it <br/>\neasier <br/>\n&gt; for her! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Duncan was younger, I didn&#39;t have so many working irons in the <br/>\n&gt; fire. And I wouldn&#39;t now if they said they wanted me more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as feeling guilty? That&#39;s just what someone says when his <br/>\nluck <br/>\n&gt; has run out in court! I never feel guilty. If I feel that the boys <br/>\nneed <br/>\n&gt; me, I stop what I&#39;m doing. As my own boss, I have that freedom. <br/>\nThat&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; the only way I would do any of this! It&#39;s a balancing act, but one <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt; leans HEAVILY in favor of the boys and their needs/wants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They grow up sooo quickly: Cameron&#39;s 19 and practically out of the <br/>\n&gt; house! I can&#39;t take back these years. I can always work more when <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re gone. But right now, they are my priorities!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; Conference Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n__<br/>\n&gt; AOL now offers free email to everyone.

I have a job that allows me to work 40 hours in 3 days.  I work 3 13 hour nights, so Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday I sleep until 12 or 1pm, Richard who is 11 sleeps until 11 or 12 in the winter (when his friends are in school) and gets up at around 9 or 10 when his friends are out of school because that is what time they come over to play.  He has been a night owl for a few years now, that may change.  He is only awake for a few hours while I sleep, and he knows that he can wake me.  That wouldn&#39;t have worked as well when he was younger.  I get up and make him something to eat if he is hungry, walk the very high energy dog if Richard hasn&#39;t, if it is Sunday I watch racing with him for an hour or two, and make us dinner, he likes to cook, so sometimes he helps me cook and sometimes I help him cook.  I have to be to work by 5:30, so he either hangs out at home and plays xbox or lego until his grandma gets home, or he goes next door to her house where she has cable and internet access.  She gets home from work by 7:30, and they hang out until she goes to bed, then he plays, watches tv, gets on the internet, or sometimes his cousin who is 15 comes over or he goes over there.  Tuesday nights I drop him off at TaeKwonDo before I go to work and either my mom or brother pick him up for me.  I miss him while I am at work, but he calls me a lot and almost always has lots of family around.  I get off at 7 am, that is when I check my email at my mom&#39;s house, check in on him, and go next door and sleep until 12 or 1.  It is not ideal, but it works for us right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is 3 days a week, the other 4 I spend as much time with him as I can (as much as he will allow &lt;g&gt;, he is getting much more independent).  He is busy during the summer, as his friends are actually allowed to play &lt;g&gt; and he attends our local space camp and also participates in junior zookeeper programs twice a year.  He is also a junior instructor at the TaeKwonDo school, so he is there 3 nights a week.  I used to do it with him, and have taken a hiatus. I need/want to start back, especially now that he is old enough that we would be in a class together (he is a much higher rank than me though &lt;g&gt;).  During the winter he isn&#39;t quite so busy and I get to see him more, and that is nice, but he really likes to be busy.  I try to take him out somewhere new every week at least, but when his friends are available he likes to stay home more, and that is fine.  I try to get things that I like to do (or want to get done) and he doesn&#39;t want to do done while he is playing with friends or off at TKD or the zoo or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Friday&#39;s I babysit my friend&#39;s almost-1-year-old, and for a while I worried that it was getting to be too much for him, so I stopped.  After she hadn&#39;t been there for a few weeks he asked me to watch her again, because he missed her.  He really likes young kids, well, all kids really.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I start to feel like I am not doing enough for him, and I take that as a cue to reevaluate my activities and talk to him about it.  If there is too much going on and he needs me more (sometimes he doesn&#39;t notice right away), I will drop something.  If necessary I can go to work up to 2 hours later, and everything else we do is optional.  If my work schedule begins to be too hard on him, I will figure something else out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy house is usually messier than I like it, but that is ok.  It gets mostly cleaned once a week (on Thursday night, usually very late!), since on Fridays we have a little one around.  Tomorrow Richard and I are taking the baby to the zoo, there is a newborn Capuchin monkey that we want to see.  Like I said, this is not the most ideal situation, but I talk to Richard tons about what we are doing, both our separate activities and the ones we do together, and I have no problem adjusting for him.  Some of the advise that I have gotten on the unschooling email lists and people like Sandra and Joyce&#39;s sites has been so beneficial to our lives.  I used to hate cleaning, and I used to take forever to do it because I hated it.  Now I can find joy in it because I think of it as creating a blank slate for Richard, and because I am happy doing it I can do it faster.  And he is happy to help sometimes, and when he is not wanting to help that is ok too, because whatever he is doing is important too.  That comes directly from the people here!  I don&#39;t remember who originally made the &quot;blank slate&quot; comment, but it has really helped me a lot.  Also the recommendations to put your children&#39;s happiness first, when I do that, I am happier.  For me a happy child makes me happier, so yes I do always put his needs (including his wants and desires, those are needs too) before mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am rambling and I need to go and pick up Richard from TaeKwonDo, and then we may make dinner together, though he just got some new (used) xbox games and he may want to play those instead.  Either is fine with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J. in Southern NM<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49413852,"authorName":"Dawn","from":"&quot;Dawn&quot; &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: balance with work and kids","postDate":"1180636722","msgId":28939,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzbjRuaSs4c240QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOTcxNEY5OUExMDA0Ny0xNTE4LUQyQ0RAbWJsay1kMTAuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28931,"nextInTopic":28941,"prevInTime":28938,"nextInTime":28940,"topicId":28931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for this info...

When Duncan was littler, I gave <br/>\nup <br/>\n&gt; the conference one year because it was just taking too much time <br/>\naway <br/>\n&gt;  from the family. We&#39;re all older (and more experienced) now. They <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt; understand the importance of what I do (all three businesses), and <br/>\nthey <br/>\n&gt; get something out of each one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Generally I work early morning or late at night. My husband, Ben, <br/>\n&gt; leaves each morning at 6:00. I&#39;m usually up by 7:00. Duncan <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; usually get up until about 10:00-ish. Cameron sleeps until 10-ish <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; later too, unless he needs to be at work earlier---but then, he&#39;s <br/>\ngone. <br/>\n&gt; So I get a few hours each morning when the boys are asleep/gone. <br/>\nBen <br/>\n&gt; goes to bed around 9:30; Cameron, at 10:00-ish; and Duncan usually <br/>\n&gt; between midnight and 1:00am ( Late nights are his favorite time <br/>\nfor <br/>\n&gt; gaming; butwhen he has a friend over---like tonight---they are out <br/>\non <br/>\n&gt; the trampoline looking at the stars and talking until about <br/>\nmidnight). <br/>\n&gt; He almost always stays up one half hour later than I do---I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow <br/>\n&gt; why. He just likes a little alone time after the rest of us are in <br/>\nbed. <br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt; So I have a few hours each evening too when the boys are <br/>\nasleep or <br/>\n&gt; occupied.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I schedule all my groom dogs for early mornings (it&#39;s cooler that <br/>\nway <br/>\n&gt; too!), so generally I&#39;m done by the time they wake up (unless Cam <br/>\nhas <br/>\n&gt; to work early). I work out in the garage, so they know where to <br/>\nfind me <br/>\n&gt; if they need me. All my groom clients know that my kids come <br/>\nfirst, so <br/>\n&gt; I schedule dogs around my kids and our activities. Plus, although <br/>\nI try <br/>\n&gt; to get dogs out as quickly as possible, I try to be sure to pad my <br/>\n&gt; schedule---just in case the boys need me for something or I get a <br/>\nphone <br/>\n&gt; call or whatever---I hate to rush through a dog.  OH! And I <br/>\nbelieve <br/>\n&gt; seriously in work smarter, not harder! I price myself at the upper <br/>\nend <br/>\n&gt; of the market, so I get 2-3 times what other groomers get. Fewer <br/>\ndogs, <br/>\n&gt; more $$$. Dog money is fun money! &lt;G&gt; So we use it to buy new <br/>\ngames or <br/>\n&gt; go out to eat (it bought a praying mantis chrysalis, a bunch of <br/>\nladybug <br/>\n&gt; larvae, some caterpillars, and a microscope two weeks ago &lt;g&gt;). <br/>\nThe <br/>\n&gt; boys like when I have a dog or two in the morning! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other two, the accountability association and the conference, <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; kind of seasonal---concentrated in a few weeks throughout the <br/>\nyear. <br/>\n&gt; Again, the boys are very generous with me because they know <br/>\nunschooling <br/>\n&gt; can make such a difference in other children&#39;s lives. If they ever <br/>\nsaid <br/>\n&gt; (even hinted!) that it was too much or too hard on the family, I <br/>\nwould <br/>\n&gt; dump the conference and the association---in a heartbeat!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really high energy, so I do a LOT each day; but I try to keep <br/>\n&gt; business separate from my time with the boys. I also try to <br/>\nschedule my <br/>\n&gt; own hobbies around them during the day---I garden while the boys <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; swimming (or early in the morning while they&#39;re sleeping). I read <br/>\nemail <br/>\n&gt; early and late and keep the computer on during the day so that I <br/>\ncan <br/>\n&gt; check in several times/day in 3-4 minute spurts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We usually cook together &#39;cause both boys love to cook. Most of <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; cleaning gets done in many small bursts through out the day---plus <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt; have someone come clean every other week. THAT helps a lot because <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt; all clean for the maid! &lt;G&gt; Beds get stripped monthly, and toys <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; books and games get picked up at a minimum of every other week so <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt; Sandy can find the floor to vacuum. She scours the bathrooms and <br/>\n&gt; kitchen, mops and vacuums all floors, and dusts every little thing <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; the house---makes my life sooo much easier! And everyone <br/>\nappreciates <br/>\n&gt; the clean house after Sandy leaves, so they don&#39;t mind making it <br/>\neasier <br/>\n&gt; for her! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Duncan was younger, I didn&#39;t have so many working irons in <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; fire. And I wouldn&#39;t now if they said they wanted me more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as feeling guilty? That&#39;s just what someone says when his <br/>\nluck <br/>\n&gt; has run out in court!
