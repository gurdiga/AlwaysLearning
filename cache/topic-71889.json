One has childhood epileptic absences and she was clear she did not want to take the medication. We went to see different natural therapists and they suggested homeopathic remedies, Bach flower essences, oils and supplements.

Fascinating!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe twin sister took some supplements, homeopathic remedies and Bach flower essences last year too for other reasons.
