Maybe I have been getting caught up in expectations or <br/>\nsome vision of how Jayn *should be* developing and her maturity level. As <br/>\nshe gets older, and I have clearer memories of my own life at her age, those <br/>\nnoisy mental tapes are coming back in force.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever on the opposite side of this is my tendency to be overly concerned <br/>\nabout the feelings of other people and overly worried about other people&#39;s <br/>\nopinions. I have written about this before. I have what might be an <br/>\nexcessively conservative idea about other people&#39;s boundaries and may be <br/>\nadvising caution to Jayn beyond what is reasonable, and she has both <br/>\nexperience and observation to tell her that I am being too worried (which <br/>\nshe translates as &quot;mean&quot; to her). A long time ago I wrote about the energy I <br/>\ninvested in helping her be quiet at night - this is entirely for the peace <br/>\nof our neighbor. I think what I have is a gulf between my expectations and <br/>\nwhat I insist upon from Jayn in the world and in dealing with others <br/>\n(despite insisting with respect if that makes sense) and the extreme <br/>\nrelaxation of her life at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I referred to Jayn finding the line between her autonomy and her <br/>\ncommunity I should have been clearer. I was talking about our family, her <br/>\nimmediate community. The fact is that when Jayn is out at other people&#39;s <br/>\nhomes or in public places she is generally very pleasant and courteous. She <br/>\nisn&#39;t making unreasonable demands. In public places like the YMCA where we <br/>\nswim, she accepts the rules and complies generally cheerfully. When visiting <br/>\nhomes she takes her cues from the host children most of the time, and <br/>\nfollows rules, sometimes sharing with me later how odd they are in her view. <br/>\nIn playing she is much less bossy sounding than she used to be, as I listen <br/>\nto her play, far more flexible. Although she sometimes gets locked into <br/>\npre-conceived plans or expectations of others, she is getting better about <br/>\nhearing my warnings and suggestions and at dealing with disappointment. The <br/>\nlast L&L conference was the scene of some real growth for her in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, all the areas where James and I are feeling challenged by Jayn&#39;s <br/>\nattitude and behavior are towards us and in our home. She has been so very <br/>\nsweet the last 10 days or so that I&#39;m having trouble coming up with an <br/>\nexample, and I know that so much of her emotional volatility is mirroring <br/>\nmine at different times. This coincides with a period when we have been on <br/>\nour nights and as we came out our neighbors were ill (and we don&#39;t play with <br/>\nsick kids if we can avoid them), so we have been spending a lot of time <br/>\ntogether just her and I, reading, writing, sewing, drawing, playing card <br/>\ngames, playing our new Wii, playing Agatha Christie and Nancy Drew computer <br/>\ngames and swimming at the YMCA. Lots of my undivided focus. Is there a <br/>\nconnection? Maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that when Jayn has been spending a lot of time with certain kids <br/>\nor playing at other homes where there are a lot of rules and strictures she <br/>\ncomes home with more stress to release, and sometimes that takes the form of <br/>\ninsisting on her &quot;rights&quot; even when no-one is trying to remove them. It <br/>\nseems like she is looking for a fight so she asks rudely and makes demands <br/>\nthat of course immediately get my back up and cause teeth gritting. This is <br/>\nwhen I try to remember some of Joyce&#39;s wonderful writing about anger in <br/>\nkids, &quot;Do you love me now, even now?&quot; and breathe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having a hard time treading the line between understanding where this is <br/>\ncoming from and my desire to impress on her that it is &quot;unacceptable&quot;, when <br/>\nthat latter mind set only makes things worse, feeding more negativity into a <br/>\nstressed moment. When does &quot;impressing&quot; some idea on to someone else ever <br/>\nwork well? I have found that silence is best. Just looking at her sadly and <br/>\nwaiting a moment. She will generally wind down and apologise (unasked) and <br/>\ntell me something about her feelings - usually expressed as &quot;tired&quot;, even <br/>\nthough I think it is closer to &quot;fed up&quot;. Yes, definitely just refraining <br/>\nfrom making any comment at all in the heat of the moment is best - but I <br/>\nhave to remember to be still. Talking later in the calm about issues was <br/>\nwhat worked best when she was little. I don&#39;t know when I shifted into being <br/>\nthis person who feels like I must immediately correct Jayn&#39;s behavior or <br/>\nattitude or speech towards me. I think I need to revisit and return to the <br/>\nhappy strategies that worked to promote peace amongst us all when Jayn was <br/>\nyounger.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

If  <br/>\nhe dies or leave I&#39;ll have to &quot;rely&quot; on my self or someone else for  <br/>\nthose things (bill paying, oil changing, wood chopping), and if I  <br/>\ndisappear Keith will need to do his own mending, laundry, shopping  <br/>\nand dishes, or find someone to do those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t rely on my own judgment, even about unschooling and  <br/>\nparenting.  I talk to Keith.  I talk to other parents I trust whose  <br/>\nkids have been through what mine are starting to go through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t rely on my own will.  We just returned home safely from a big  <br/>\nouting yesterday, four people, over 500 miles travelled and home  <br/>\nagain.  I needed them to want to agree to go.  I didn&#39;t personally  <br/>\nearn the $200 for the theatre tickets.  I didn&#39;t do any of the  <br/>\ndriving.  It was my idea, though, and my purchase and planning and  <br/>\nletter to the grandparents.  I wrote the checklist for what to take  <br/>\nin the car.  But if any of those other three had said &quot;not fun&quot; or &quot;I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to,&quot; it wouldn&#39;t have been fun.  It was something we did  <br/>\nas a group.   I relied on them for some parts, and they relied on me  <br/>\nfor some parts, and that&#39;s how it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I met in a Renaissance music group.  No one person can sing  <br/>\nmadrigals alone.  I ended up being the coordinator and leader of that  <br/>\ngroup, through no planning, will or judgment of my own.  The original  <br/>\nintended director never showed up.  I accepted the task tentatively  <br/>\nat first and strongly after a while, and other people relied on me.   <br/>\nAnd I needed to run it in such a way that they wanted to come back,  <br/>\nbecause its impossible for one person to run a madrigal group when  <br/>\nthere&#39;s no group to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m used to group activities and inter-dependencies and  <br/>\nassistances.   I think it&#39;s good and right and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the &quot;one&#39;s own will and judgement&quot; comes at the &quot;do I go on  <br/>\nthis road trip or not?&quot; or &quot;Do I go back and sing again or not?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

To be honest I&#39;m a bit surprised that the<br/>\nidea of autonomy is being considered as a negative, outside of the<br/>\ntranslation difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the context of my little piece on television, I was talking about<br/>\nautonomy as the character&#39;s freedom to make decisions and take actions<br/>\nwithout constantly having to ask permission of their parents or some other<br/>\nauthority. The characters are making decisions and taking actions <br/>\nindependently of authority figures, to an unrealistic outlandish extent.<br/>\nSometimes there are problematic consequences, which is the<br/>\n&quot;hi-jinks&quot;, and sometimes the results are positive. I&#39;m immediately thinking<br/>\nof the time Raven covered herself with clay and feathers and got on a bus to<br/>\nhelp her friend. The underlying paradigm in all these family comedies is one <br/>\nof separation of parents and children, coupled with the belief that the <br/>\nparents &quot;job&quot; is to stymie the whacky plans and put road blocks in their <br/>\nkids&#39; way - two pieces of thinking that are the opposite of unschooling <br/>\npractice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I believe I referred to &quot;more&quot; autonomy. There is a wide variation<br/>\nbetween the notion of &quot;absolute autonomy&quot; - which we can define as no notion <br/>\nor regard for community or other<br/>\npeople - and the near zero autonomy created by the circumscribed life that<br/>\nmost regular kids seem to live - at least the bits of lives that I see when<br/>\nI go out in public and listen to conventional parents with their kids at <br/>\nplaces like the park, the store, museums and the YMCA swimming pool - the<br/>\nconstant barrage of orders and minutiae of control from the parents, the<br/>\nendless ENDLESS checking from the kids as to whether it&#39;s ok to eat a candy <br/>\nor take off one&#39;s<br/>\nsweater or go to the bathroom that the kids seem to take as normal<br/>\ninteractions. And just to clarify I&#39;m talking about asking permission way <br/>\nbeyond what might be<br/>\nconsidered  plain politeness on the part of a youngster, the kind of <br/>\ncourteous checking in that our unschooled kids increasingly show with <br/>\nmaturity like whether the last soda in the fridge is spoken for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found this page of links:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ask.com/web?q=Principle+of+Autonomy&qsrc=6&o=10601\">http://www.ask.com/web?q=Principle+of+Autonomy&qsrc=6&o=10601</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI like this definition of the Principle of Autonomy:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The principle of respect for autonomy, Respect for autonomy, then, should<br/>\nnot be construed as an absolute and foundational value, but a &quot;middle<br/>\nprinciple&quot; that requires every individual to respect every other <br/>\nindividual&#39;s<br/>\nself-determination to an appropriate extent within the context of<br/>\ncommunity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nespecially when combined with this idea:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The principle of autonomy, or self-determination, entails respecting the<br/>\nchoices and wishes of persons who have the capacity to decide and protecting<br/>\nthose who lack this capacity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe freedom (within the law of the land) to make personal decisions and take <br/>\nactions based on one&#39;s own<br/>\njudgment, without having to ask permission of some perceived authority <br/>\nfigure (that<br/>\npermission is not required) - that is what autonomy means to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seems to be a perception that autonomy has &quot;separation&quot; as it&#39;s <br/>\nfoundation which could be a problem for unschooling.<br/>\nHowever these definitions show that the idea of community and the idea of <br/>\nparental guidance,<br/>\n are both included even wrapped up in the working definition of &quot;autonomy&quot; <br/>\nalready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI allow Jayn as much autonomy as I can, especially since in the wider world <br/>\nconventional ideas - about how<br/>\nlittle autonomy she should be allowed, how little &quot;capacity&quot; she must have<br/>\nto understand her own wishes (in conventional thinking about kids), how few<br/>\nrights to enact decisions most parents give their children - conventional<br/>\nideas appear overwhelmingly against granting any autonomy to a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not help with the problem of translating to another language<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps there might be something useful for translations in the idea of<br/>\nindependence of thought. I like the definition in &quot;Now Voyager&quot; (Bette<br/>\nDavis, Paul Henried - 1942). To the best of my recollection:<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte: &quot;Independence of mind means relying on one&#39;s own will and<br/>\njudgement.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was from an adult who had been mercilessly squashed and bossed and<br/>\ncontrolled all her life to the point of having a nervous breakdown and<br/>\nhaving to relearn to trust her own judgment and opinions and become free of <br/>\nfear.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is very determined in protecting her right to express her opinion, her <br/>\nwants, her intended or desired course of action. I believe she has a very <br/>\nstrong sense of self. She is going to make bad decisions sometimes. I have <br/>\nlearnt, with Jayn&#39;s particular temperament, that the negative energy and <br/>\nanger resulting from trying to guide her away from bad decisions (or speed <br/>\nup her process) are usually more than the small amount of negative energy <br/>\nresulting from her persisting in enacting the bad decision - especially when <br/>\nI act as a cushion (to use a familiar example just quietly putting the <br/>\nsweater or the other shoes into my bag.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will loudly protest &quot;it&#39;s MY decision&quot; and doesn&#39;t like hearing at all <br/>\nthat there are times when it is NOT. She is still learning where her <br/>\nautonomy meets the community, still learning how her decisions can affect <br/>\nthe members of her family. I&#39;m still waiting for the full flowering of <br/>\nempathy, even as I am finally seeing moments of it.  We have been having <br/>\nstruggles with what I can only see as her self-centeredness. I am sometimes <br/>\nbaffled. Jayn will say that she is &quot;the most important thing&quot;, and it has <br/>\nbeen hard for her to hear that even if that is so, she is not the only <br/>\nthing. Sometimes the only thing that has changed her obnoxious behavior or <br/>\nher thinking has been very strong disapproval from her father and I. So <br/>\nwhile there is autonomy, there are also boundaries to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet it may be that my thinking on this is all wrong, that I should be <br/>\nthinking more in terms of our family community of three rather than as three <br/>\nindividuals dancing together. Perhaps we could talk a little about hierarchy <br/>\nin family structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
