I received what you were saying with my heart and mind wide open and because of who you are, what you believe and what you are doing I felt empowered and therefore able to express myself to you and to be vulnerable in the group. As a result of our discussion I felt my own intelligence in a way I never had all my life. Because of your stories and talks about unschooling I was able to see my own, unique area of intelligence and to honor the directions I have gone on my own when I followed what motivated me after being &quot;dumbed down&quot; by school and doing what I thought others wanted me to do. This all adds up to a newly blossomed intuition in the area of my children. I now feel more confident and can see the way I can assist my children to find and do what they are drawn to. I am also more comfortable with people who seem very intelligent and who may have scared me out of some of my beliefs. I am intelligent in a different way and it is just as valuable.

We haven&#39;t used a math curriculum for ten years.  We<br/>\nreally do not use curriculum for much but reference.  Like encyclopedias,<br/>\nbut with more focused content and that not everyday.  We are bibliophiles<br/>\nand have bunches of books about bunches of subjects and thousands of stories<br/>\nfrom lots of genres.  WE are a booky family.  My husband and I have advanced<br/>\ndegrees in vastly different studies (from each other) so yeah, we are<br/>\nbooky.  We have books about math because I can&#39;t necessarily answer their<br/>\nquestions.  My kids have known how to research with the internet, books, the<br/>\nlibrary, people, etc... for many many years now.  My son and daughter love<br/>\nplaying with math concepts and wanted an easy to use place to go to to look<br/>\nthis up and read about it and hear about it.  My son particularly is<br/>\ninterested in theoretical physics and wanted to know more formal math so<br/>\nthat he could understand the stuff he is reading about quantum mechanics.<br/>\nHe tells me about what he is reading about, thank goodness that I am not<br/>\nrequired to understand everything he learns...    I get a lot of it though.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you call quantum mechanics a real world application, then he is using<br/>\nit to get to real world application.  I am not really capable of taking him<br/>\nwhere he wants to go, his father can help, but his dad can only be here a<br/>\nlimited time, given that we haven&#39;t found a way to get paid just for<br/>\nexisting or to live without money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a real mathy person.  I am good at calculation and we had lots of<br/>\nfun playing calculation games out in the world with groceries and all of the<br/>\nday to day math.  My husband has degrees in math and math related fields.  I<br/>\nfound number theory and calculus interesting once it got theoretical but not<br/>\nso much so that I sit around and read about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know algebra and can help them right now, but frankly, both of my children<br/>\nenjoy math much more than I do and they asked for a program that would tell<br/>\nthem about schooly math.  I am not talented enough to figure out real world<br/>\napplications for algebra or calculus.  My 12 and 14 year old children are<br/>\nfine with that and so they use the online program to get their questions<br/>\nanswered.  It covers a vast array of math subjects, like calculus and<br/>\ntrigonometry, etc.  They find it interesting like I find psychological<br/>\nresearch interesting (which they do not).  My daughter has sat for hours<br/>\nworking on her own Fibonacci sequence.  No one suggested it, she just did<br/>\nit.  Just like her art, she draws for hours.  I bought a &#39;curriculum&#39;<br/>\nbecause it was a cheap, easy way to get a bunch of post card sized art to<br/>\nlook at.  My son likes to read or listen to a vast array of subjects and<br/>\ntalks about some of them.  I love to watch them discover all of these things<br/>\nthat I may never have known<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit to trying to get him to record some of his stories in some<br/>\nway.  His stories are amazing and I want (perhaps selfishly) to be able to<br/>\nsave them.  He records some of them and asked if I would help him type or<br/>\nwrite some.  I agreed to give whatever help he wanted and we have made an<br/>\nappointment to sit down and figure out how to best do it.  I think he may<br/>\nwant to learn to write.  I will know when he tells me or asks me.  BTW we<br/>\nmake appointments because we have a busy schedule and have to plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur homeschooling has been a lot of them saying &quot;Hey mom, can we....?&quot; and<br/>\nme finding a way to do it.  Or me sayng, &quot;Hey guys, how&#39;d you like to ....&quot;<br/>\nField trips, projects, library trips, book stores, museums.... etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot imagine how we would have done &quot;school&quot;, either at home or in an<br/>\ninstitution.  The closest we come is dance lessons (my daughter is taking<br/>\nsome 7 hours a week) and Kung fu (my son primarily, my daughter in the<br/>\nsummers).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are required by our state law to cover certain subjects, and now that<br/>\nthey are older, my kids and I come up with ways that we can all enjoy to<br/>\nmeet these requirements.  No &#39;programs&#39;, just schedules and fun (aka &#39;want<br/>\nto&#39;s&#39;) and the occasional &quot;have to&quot; (aka chores).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that they know their manners and how to avoid most dangers, my job seems<br/>\nto be facilitator, chauffeur, accounts payable clerk, listener, enterprise<br/>\nmanagement.... and person who shows cooking techniques.

I do safeguard the integrity of this discussion, by trying to<br/>\n&gt; bring suggestions back toward unschooling. People can get mainstream,<br/>\n&gt; school-style advice all OVER the place, for free or for money. There are few<br/>\n&gt; places where consistent, quality unschooling advice is available. (There are<br/>\n&gt; moderators who help me keep this list strong, too, out of the goodness of<br/>\n&gt; their hearts, and their desire to help others understand unschooling.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If someone wants to put that in a negative light, they could say I &quot;police&quot;<br/>\n&gt; the list. It could be said that I &quot;police&quot; my yard, because I pick up trash<br/>\n&gt; and pay attention to whether things are safe and secure out there. It could<br/>\n&gt; be said that I &quot;police&quot; my words, because I try to be careful not to say<br/>\n&gt; things I wouldn&#39;t want quoted more widely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If someone said this in a more positive light, it would be that I take care<br/>\n&gt; of this list, and my yard, that I am careful with my words. I do care for<br/>\n&gt; this list. I care about providing unschooling information for people,<br/>\n&gt; freely. When I started, there was Growing Without Schooling magazine, every<br/>\n&gt; other month, and other than buying Teach Your Own by John Holt (when the<br/>\n&gt; first edition was still available), there was very little help. I was lucky<br/>\n&gt; enough to know two other unschooling families. That might have been a world<br/>\n&gt; record for in-person help in 1991. :-) I had been involved in La-Leche<br/>\n&gt; -League-style attachment parenting since 1986 already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Others jump into unschooling from a school platform, and some don&#39;t jump<br/>\n&gt; far. If some kids are in school and some aren&#39;t, school is always right<br/>\n&gt; there, casting a giant shadow over home life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I only clean and guard my own yard. I don&#39;t go to other people&#39;s yards and<br/>\n&gt; check on the security of their tools or wheelbarrow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;unschooling police&quot; are not going door to door. The &quot;door&quot; to this<br/>\n&gt; list is watched, though. Within this discussion, it would be<br/>\n&gt; counterproductive to call just any old &quot;program&quot; unschooling. Before there<br/>\n&gt; were such separate discussions for different kinds of homeschooling,<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers endured people saying they were unschoolers because they let<br/>\n&gt; their kids do their lessons on the couch or in the yard if they wanted to,<br/>\n&gt; and didn&#39;t limit them to the kitchen table. There ARE some things that are<br/>\n&gt; clearly not unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I suppose that since I have been at this for a few (10) years, it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; bother me. I just replied that labels are only useful when they are useful,<br/>\n&gt; so maybe we aren&#39;t unschoolers... -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If they&#39;ve been using a math curriculum for ten years, you probably<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t imagine that&#39;s what unschooling math could be like in its purest,<br/>\n&gt; most real-world form.

I do safeguard the integrity of this discussion, by trying to bring suggestions back toward unschooling.   People can get mainstream, school-style advice all OVER the place, for free or for money.  There are few places where consistent, quality unschooling advice is available.   (There are moderators who help me keep this list strong, too, out of the goodness of their hearts, and their desire to help others understand unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wants to put that in a negative light, they could say I &quot;police&quot; the list.   It could be said that I &quot;police&quot; my yard, because I pick up trash and pay attention to whether things are safe and secure out there.  It could be said that I &quot;police&quot; my words, because I try to be careful not to say things I wouldn&#39;t want quoted more widely.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone said this in a more positive light, it would be that I take care of this list, and my yard, that I am careful with my words.  I do care for this list.  I care about providing unschooling information for people, freely.  When I started, there was Growing Without Schooling magazine, every other month, and other than buying Teach Your Own by John Holt (when the first edition was still available), there was very little help.  I was lucky enough to know two other unschooling families.  That might have been a world record for in-person help in 1991. :-)    I had been involved in La-Leche -League-style attachment parenting since 1986 already.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers jump into unschooling from a school platform, and some don&#39;t jump far.

I don&#39;t go to other people&#39;s yards and check on the security of their tools or wheelbarrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;unschooling police&quot; are not going door to door.  The &quot;door&quot; to this list is watched, though.  Within this discussion, it would be counterproductive to call just any old &quot;program&quot; unschooling.   Before there were such separate discussions for different kinds of homeschooling, unschoolers endured people saying they were unschoolers because they let their kids do their lessons on the couch or in the yard if they wanted to, and didn&#39;t limit them to the kitchen table.

I saw my job as protecting them from experiencing the anxiety that so many of the adults in their lives felt about how and what they were learning.

Out with the  <br/>\nmonolithic, traditional thinking, in with flexibility and diversity!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that without a clear idea where you&#39;re headed, it&#39;s  <br/>\nhard to figure out how to get there. And when connecting with people  <br/>\nheaded in vague but different directions, how can they help each other  <br/>\nget anywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ideas that &quot;work&quot;. There are many &quot;good&quot; ideas out  <br/>\nthere. There are many ideas that feel &quot;right&quot;. But not all of them are  <br/>\ncompatible. Some of them stop the others in their tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless someone has a clear idea of what &quot;works&quot; means *to them* and  <br/>\nwhat &quot;good&quot; means *to them*, they&#39;re going to be like a bumper car  <br/>\nwith power but no steering, racing around encountering &quot;good&quot; ideas  <br/>\nthat bounce them off in &quot;good&quot; but chaotic directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless someone examines the baggage they&#39;ve picked up throughout life,  <br/>\nwhat feels &quot;right&quot; may only be what&#39;s making the baggage feel more  <br/>\ncomfortable and it can unintentionally damage their relationship with  <br/>\ntheir kids or their spouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiguring out what &quot;works&quot;, is &quot;good&quot; and is &quot;right&quot; isn&#39;t as easy as  <br/>\nit sounds! We all *think* we know what those words mean. We&#39;ve lived  <br/>\nwith them our whole lives, using them effortlessly. But most people  <br/>\nnever stop to think clearly about the things they want, or how well  <br/>\nthose things work together, and where and how they&#39;ll interfere and  <br/>\nwhich take priority when they do and what effect that will have on the  <br/>\nother things they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the list isn&#39;t to define what works or what&#39;s good or  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s right for other people. The purpose of the list is to define  <br/>\nthem clearly for the list, so the direction we&#39;re helping people head  <br/>\nis clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needs to adopt all the ideas talked about here for their  <br/>\nfamilies. But members are asked, for the peace of the others on the  <br/>\nlist, to not interfere with the clear direction the list is focused  <br/>\non. Members are free -- encouraged! -- to find other resources so they  <br/>\ncan mix and match to define what &quot;works&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are  <br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":363518215,"authorName":"Claire","from":"&quot;Claire&quot; &lt;claire.horsley08@...&gt;","profile":"claire.horsley08","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Does anyone feel limited by being on this list?","postDate":"1298616458","msgId":60063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlrN2phYSszMWs0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9TWRXeFI3PV9lUFhBZFZkUHB3c3BHQktzOEp5OF82clBrYjV3cUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60060,"nextInTopic":60064,"prevInTime":60062,"nextInTime":60064,"topicId":60059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-738609061\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I love many aspects of unschooling, especially the respectful and partnership approaches to raising children, but I could do without all the prescriptive &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musts.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the above reveals a lot more about the writer&#39;s mindset than about the nature of unschooling or this list.

Church is not for swimming.<br/>\n<br/>\nA list created and maintained for the purpose of discussing unschooling is not intended for and should not encourage or allow anything other than that stated purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, someone old enough to have children asked me this morning to remove her from the list.  People old enough to figure out how to get ON a yahoogroups mailing list are old enough to figure out how to get off of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen from another list member, I received this.  It tells me what I believe (falsely), lumps me in with all other people my age (falsely) and says I&#39;m not accepting or loving.

I really don&#39;t believe that in <br/>\nlife there is only one way to live or one way to parent.<br/>\nI love many aspects of unschooling, especially the respectful and partnership <br/>\napproaches to raising children, but I could do without all the prescriptive  <br/>\n&quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI admire your perseverance at what is clearly your life work, and I wish you all <br/>\nthe best with it. You are actually my mom&#39;s age and maybe it is your generation <br/>\nbut I find many similarities between you and her in terms of thinking that life <br/>\nshould be one way or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily I think my generation is breaking free of this and is more accepting and <br/>\nmore loving and grateful for diversity.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was in here when the note arrived and she said I should ask the mom this:  If the mom feels &quot;restricted&quot; by this list, she might want to consider how her children feel about being restricted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how many people here would be willing to be welcomed into that poster&#39;s &quot;generation&quot; (and I never knew or cared how old she was), but SERIOUSLY!?<br/>\n<br/>\nDiversity is fine!<br/>\nThis list isn&#39;t for the discussion of diversity.  I KNOW the readership of the list is hugely diverse.  They came here, though, to discuss what will help unschooling work the way it has worked long term in the lives of my family, Pam&#39;s Joyce&#39;s, Deb&#39;s and many other writers here.  Not the way a mom who will reject my ideas because I&#39;m as old as her mother thinks or wishes it would work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t believe that in live there is only one way to live or one way to parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really *DO* believe, because I have seen entire lifetimes be lived, that there are most definitely ways to act, think and be that harm relationships and that prevent unschooling from working.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people leave the list I don&#39;t get notifications.  I don&#39;t care.  I don&#39;t take roll, I don&#39;t get notifications when people join.  I could, but I&#39;ve had it turned off since the list was created.   The only reason for someone to write to me and say &quot;I&#39;m leaving your list now&quot; is to insult me on the way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have perseverance. :-)<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean I appreciate childish behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents of children who are considering unschooling should find as many resources as they want.  This might be one of them.  I&#39;ve never asked ANYone to make this their only resource.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose with mother issues might want to attempt to avoid projecting them onto me, and deal with them in an adult fashion, for the good of their children and marriages/partnerships.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues\">http://sandradodd.com/issues</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60067,"nextTopicId":60106}}
