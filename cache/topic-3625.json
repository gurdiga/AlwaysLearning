I understand why these ideas are threatening and<br/>\nscary for people, I do, but after a while it just gets wearing and isn&#39;t<br/>\nmuch fun. Often, the first step in learning something new is to stop<br/>\nfighting the ideas at the doorstep and just let them come in, and examine<br/>\nthem, and play with them, and then come back and ask real questions based<br/>\non that thoughtful knowledge.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sure not here to adopt anyone else&#39;s truths.

If you are coming here for advice on unschooling, why do you not<br/>\nwant to listen to our answers? We are more experienced than you in this<br/>\narea. We are older, therefore we have been doing this longer and have more<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\nNewbie: Are you saying I am young and don&#39;t have anything good to say at<br/>\nall?<br/>\nOld Timer: No, we are saying in this case we have more experience, we happen<br/>\nto be older and aren&#39;t you here to learn what we have found to be true?<br/>\n(stage goes dark)<br/>\n(applause)<br/>\nOne thing I try very hard to remember is that many times, people take<br/>\npersonally something that was not intended to be personal.

For<br/>\nexample, assuming that all people of the gen X age are<br/>\ndisrespectful, spoiled, and niave. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you mean judging that your &quot;ideas&quot; are less<br/>\n&gt; brilliant - than that&#39;s silly, <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll all judge your ideas on their merits, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope so.  Although I am not sure that is the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are under 34, you are closer in age to my<br/>\n&gt; daughter than to me. Your <br/>\n&gt; experience AS a teenager and young adult can be<br/>\n&gt; valuable to me and I <br/>\n&gt; appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That agrees with what I was saying, that experience<br/>\ndoes not just have to be from the parent point of view<br/>\nto be valuable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Not that your <br/>\n&gt; kids and your experiences might not be a little<br/>\n&gt; different and they certainly <br/>\n&gt; are often interesting to me - I ENJOY hearing about<br/>\n&gt; them - and once in a <br/>\n&gt; while someone might come up with a really<br/>\n&gt; interesting new idea, but mostly <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard it before and seen it with my own eyes.<br/>\n&gt; It isn&#39;t a reflection of <br/>\n&gt; any of you not being brilliant and wonderful and<br/>\n&gt; insightful and fully <br/>\n&gt; understanding of unschooling ideas.

Just wanted to discuss it because some posts<br/>\ncame across as saying that younger age and less<br/>\nexperience means the persons comments are not as<br/>\nvaluable.  I am not sure anyone meant that and I<br/>\npersonally am not offended.  It is a topic I feel is<br/>\nimportant to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n.&gt; But, it is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; natural for the old to remind the young to slow down<br/>\n&gt; and stop talking <br/>\n&gt; themselves and to spend some time listening instead,<br/>\n&gt; especially when they are <br/>\n&gt; talking talking talking and not appearing to realize<br/>\n&gt; that they aren&#39;t really <br/>\n&gt; paying attention, but just spouting their own<br/>\n&gt; opinions. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Funny, as a young person I could say the same about<br/>\nsome older relatives of mine who think they have<br/>\nnothing more to learn.  I may be talking a lot now,<br/>\nbut it was after deep thought on the subject and<br/>\ndiscussing it with my dh and reading the posts here,<br/>\nsome more than once.  I have been on this list since<br/>\nearly Dec. and rarely post, so I hope you do not feel<br/>\nthat I am just spouting my opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Societies in which <br/>\n&gt; age and experience are not respected are really sad<br/>\n&gt; - this society is so very <br/>\n&gt; much like that and it limits our ability to make<br/>\n&gt; social progress. Each new <br/>\n&gt; generation discounting the value of the experience<br/>\n&gt; of the previous one. <br/>\n&gt; Sadder to see it in unschoolers, for some reason.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not discounting my elders.  That is my point, not<br/>\nto discount some one based on age, be they younger or<br/>\nolder.  I have learned a lot from people older than<br/>\nme.  I have also learned a lot from children and<br/>\npeople my age.  I respect people for who they are.  I<br/>\nwould not respect some one JUST because they are<br/>\nolder, though, if their behavior did not merit my<br/>\nrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKitrina<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
