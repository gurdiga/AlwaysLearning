He gripes about the Erectile Dysfunction ads that are on every five minutes.  About a year ago he said &quot;I know that is important to adults but kids get tired of hearing about it all the time.&quot;  So we&#39;ve made a game of being silly about the ads - I&#39;ll say something like &quot;Oh Zac here&#39;s your favorite ad.&quot;  Then we laugh together.  He still says &quot;ewwwww&quot; to romance scenes in movies and jokingly says it when he catches his dad and I kissing or saying romantic things to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son would still run naked through the house, except that I at one point a couple of years ago, told him that I didn&#39;t think it appropriate for us to see each other naked any more - and let him know that the reason is because it was a societal norm thing.  He gets that because we talk with him about societal expectations a lot - some things he does not tend to just pick up on  - we have to discuss them and point them out to him.  Just this week he said he didn&#39;t care if I saw him naked, but it would bother him if other&#39;s saw him - that he just covers up to honor my wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not going to strew to avoid discussion, but to just have the info on hand for his independent &quot;research&quot;  - for example if it is 2 AM and we are asleep but Zac chooses to explore the subject - maybe something on TV sparks his curiosity - the resource would be there.

Richard (12) has never been embarrassed about his body, though he is more private with others recently.  He has even come to me to show me how much pubic hair he has gotten (&quot;LOOK MOM!!!&quot;).  I am more embarrassed than he is when he does that!  I try not to show it though!

There are times that we will hear something on TV that goes above and beyond his knowledge, a recent example was a reference to oral sex (Mom, what&#39;s a blow job?), I just take a deep breath and explain in little increments, giving only as much info as he is ready for and happy with.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t &quot;strew&quot; the sex topic&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A book is no substitute for a parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone here mean&#39;t that a book should be used in place of parental involvement.  I got a book for Richard a few years ago, I think he was 8.  I left it in the bathroom, he read through it some, so did I!  He saw me reading it, I commented about things when I was reading sometimes.  There were some boyish things that I didn&#39;t know (and I told him that)!  He asked if there was a girl version, and that made me remember in 6th grade or so when boys and girls got taken into the cafeteria separately for our little movies.  Everyone knew that the girls movie was about menstruation.  We girls wanted to know what the boys movie was about!  The only thing we could think of was wet dreams, and the boys wouldn&#39;t tell!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI gave that book to another friend of mine who had a son, and recently, at 12, Richard asked where it was.  He is going through new changes and would like to read different parts of it.

His girlfriend even wrote me to let<br/>\nme know when she went on birth control. How wild is that? I never<br/>\nasked them to tell me anything, but they always knew I would be a<br/>\nresource of information without judgement. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been a lot of interesting talks over the last few years but<br/>\nTrevor and Moira&#39;s relationship has spurred a whole new level of<br/>\nopenness. She&#39;s as open and talkative as I am, so I suppose that makes<br/>\na big difference.;) A more private person might not feel the same<br/>\nabout sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice is to try and analyze why you feel uncomfortable with sex<br/>\ntalk. It&#39;s one of the most natural parts of being human and I really<br/>\nbelieve that openness is hugely important. Dh and I don&#39;t hide our<br/>\nsexuality (meaning we talk about it in front of the kids) and we don&#39;t<br/>\nshy away from their questions. GET comfortable. I think that would be<br/>\nreally helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your child&#39;s age, he probably knows a LOT more than you think he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: teen boy development","postDate":"1205964525","msgId":33279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3RTI5NTRFLTYyQTQtNDZEMy1BMkE2LTlBQTA2QzEzREYxREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyczI0ZStzNjg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZyczI0ZStzNjg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33277,"nextInTopic":33280,"prevInTime":33278,"nextInTime":33280,"topicId":33273,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some former discussion and links are here: http://sandradodd.com/sex","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-10057650\">Some former discussion and links are here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sex\">http://sandradodd.com/sex</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: teen boy development","postDate":"1205963726","msgId":33277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyczI0ZStzNjg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyN2UwMWM4OGEwMyQyMWY2MTcxMCRjNWVlNGM0NUB1c2VyZTM4NWNiM2FkMD4="},"prevInTopic":33273,"nextInTopic":33279,"prevInTime":33276,"nextInTime":33278,"topicId":33273,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I hope I&#39;m using the right words.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear hubby was sexually abused at a young age and says he has no idea of what is considered &quot;normal&quot; development. (I hate using the word normal so I put it in quotes as I did not know how else to say what I needed)  I&#39;m clueless too as my parents certainly never discussed anything like this with me.  I know how I developed and my thoughts but I was not a boy. <br/>\n<br/>\nZac is 13 - will be 14 in June.  He is an only child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would appreciate information / resources for us (the adults/parents) and possibly things like how to have conversations about it with your teen.  I find myself getting embarrassed and avoiding and Hubby is at a loss too. I tried putting it off on hubby (you know the ole&#39; go ask your father avoidance) thinking he was the male and would have all the answers but Ed finally told me that was not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when we went to see Transformers a few months ago, the boy&#39;s mother kept going on and on about masturbating and our son asked what exactly that meant.

I&#39;m thinking of strewing - just having it available - not saying &quot;here read this&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of the functionality of it all - I know he is curious about that;  but also the human element of it - emotional feelings, love, responsibility, possible disease risks, etc.  He may not be ready for all that at his age but then again I really don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all your help - I didn&#39;t know who else to ask.
