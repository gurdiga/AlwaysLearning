She gets one every year at this time, when swimming season begins. While <br/>\nwe were there the doctor who saw her, not her regular doctor, stated that her <br/>\nshots needed to be updated. Apparently 7th grade shots that are standard in <br/>\nCalifornia. I&#39;ll admit that as babies, I did do the standard round of shots, but <br/>\nnow that we have changed our lifestyle and I have so many medical issues of <br/>\nmy own, I am constantly looking at pros and cons regarding side effects and <br/>\noverall betterment when it comes to drugs. So I am at a crossroads, Kree was very <br/>\nconcerned at the doctor stating these shots were &quot;needed&quot;. I don&#39;t feel they <br/>\nneed these shots, but am unsure where to go for the info where the bias is not <br/>\ntoward automatically getting your child immunized. I have a compromised <br/>\nimmune system and it is believed to have a strong genetic link in my family. They <br/>\ntwins have not been diagnosed, but both have strong symptoms that makes me <br/>\nworry about it enough to wonder if by having them immunized, could it ultimately <br/>\ncompromise them later. I know this is not a medical posting list, but I trust <br/>\nthat the parents here are well versed in thinking outside the box and figured <br/>\nyou all would give me some heads up. Plus I know everyone here does their <br/>\nhomework when it comes to their children. That&#39;s the part of this list I love the <br/>\nmost. <br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14585,"nextTopicId":14762}}
