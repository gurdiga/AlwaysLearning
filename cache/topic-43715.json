Try saying those words in different languages, or explore the<br/>\nfact that different cultures have different insults (english is obsessed<br/>\nwith sex and elimination, but other cultures talk about the bottom of your<br/>\nfoot or your thumbs or whatever... it&#39;s kind of fascinating...)<br/>\n<br/>\nCartoon insults are also mines of creativity. Kestrel, who is about to turn<br/>\nfour, adopted &quot;Holy clam and cuttlefish!&quot; as his exclamation of choice. I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s from Lilo and Stitch, but I&#39;m not positive.
