The experiment had to do<br/>\nwith learning; the mouse would be taken out and put right back in, over and<br/>\nover.  The result was, with each repetition, it took more time, not less,<br/>\nfor the mouse to find the platform.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOOh yeah!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes, though Encore is my favorite game, it comes the point where I <br/>\njust don&#39;t care.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI love museums, but I learned when I went to England, and confirmed later <br/>\nwhen I had ten days (one day doled out at a time, van in the shop, &quot;we&#39;re leaving <br/>\ntomorrow,&quot; for Ten whole days) in Washington DC, and I saw all the <br/>\nSmithsonian, and the Library of Congress, and then started going to the Library of <br/>\nCongress to read every day that...<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned that I can get museum sick.  Really feeling an urge to get the heck <br/>\nout.  I could be standing looking at the world&#39;s biggest intact silver vein <br/>\n(or whatever very cool thing) and think nothing but &quot;french fries&quot; or &quot;I wonder <br/>\nif it&#39;s raining? I&#39;d rather be standing in the rain than looking at one more <br/>\npriceless, unique-on-earth, incredible thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that you tell the story of the poor swimming mice, I think if they put <br/>\nthe mouse in there too many more times, he might just rather sink and drown <br/>\nthan find the platform.   Had I been forced to look at more museum stuff <br/>\nagainst my will, I could have come to the point that I learned not to see it at all, <br/>\nand then I would be looking at those Revolutionary War guns and thinking, <br/>\n&quot;Well, if the rifles wouldn&#39;t fire, I could throw myself on the bayonette,&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n. . .and that makes me think of school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20222,"nextTopicId":20259}}
