Tears welled up in my eyes as I began to think that maybe, just maybe I might be able to have what you have Sandra, Pam, Joyce and so many others who can reassure us young unschooling families that this lifestyle leads us closer to ourselves and closer to our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents are good parents. They worked long and hard all of my childhood to give us what we had and I respect them for that. They were also unavailable parents. Physically they were at home very seldom, leaving us four kids to spend many hours every day without adult supervision. They were also emotionally unavailable in terms of being able to have deep and meaningful relationships with their children. Now that we are grown, that gap has closed a little and I feel closer to them now then ever. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut imagine my surprise when I had my first child almost 6 years ago and I discovered that I could do it different. Pure joy at discovering attachment parenting, the family bed, long-term nursing, and now unschooling. I feel like I have a chance to create something with my children that I didn&#39;t have with my parents when they were raising me and it feels enormously gratifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can often get caught up in the day to day mechanics of this unschooling life and forget that I have this beautiful thing to look forward to, which is a satisfying relationship with my children as adults. Somebody said somewhere once (how&#39;s that for a reference!) that they were totally thrilled at the prize of unschooling their children: having that deep relationship extend into the adult years. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to say that we should unschool with the purpose of producing these great adults (even though that is what happens). I unschool today because it deeply serves our family today, and I am confident that it will continue to serve us in even greater ways the more time we practice unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, Sandra, thank you for letting me look into these moments with you and your children so that I may have that vision of possibility for our family.  Wow! I feel refreshed and ready to give myself fully to my family and this unschooling life. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmiringly,<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador<br/>\nDivina 5.5<br/>\nSabina almost 4!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

There is a HUGE need for these in our community and at first it seemed like the perfect way for me to make money and stay home with my children.  I even *babysat* a friend&#39;s baby/toddler for 9 months, 3 days a week.  But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that there was no reasonable way that I could design this business so that I could REALLY spend more time with my children.  Not only that but our home/refuge would no longer be that for us -- for most of the week it wouldn&#39;t be our house it would be a place of business.  Even DH, who would have loved for a second income, could see that it would really end up sucking away at our time and freedom, costing us more in less tangible ways than I could ever make up for in money.  And this was all long before I discovered the concept or lifestyle of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it will be difficult to find balance when you can&#39;t give your children&#39;s needs the weight they deserve because of all the other things going on and pulling you in various directions in your house each day.  I am not saying don&#39;t do a daycare, but I am saying that I don&#39;t think that there is going to be an &quot;easy for you&quot; way around this issue -- running a daycare and having an unschooling lifestyle seem like difficult things to balance.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more practical note, could you have sat down with her and invited other children to join you two?  Sometimes she might be okay just having you down on the floor playing with her, even if other children are playing there as well.  Sometimes she might just be crazing one-on-one time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Balance","postDate":"1238878987","msgId":43751,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzN0JDMDZGLUIyMEItNEI5MS1CQzJGLTAzRkRCMDQwNDUyNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmZS41MDk2OGEyZC4zNzA4ZjRlOUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNmZS41MDk2OGEyZC4zNzA4ZjRlOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43745,"nextInTopic":43753,"prevInTime":43750,"nextInTime":43752,"topicId":43703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When some<br/>\n(in my view) extreme behavior came to a head between Karl and those siblings<br/>\n(the whole family really), I wanted to make sure that his continued contact<br/>\nwith them was due to his own choices.  There are privileges there which I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to be part of the choice and so I wanted to give him other<br/>\noutlets for those privileges though I couldn&#39;t financially provide them<br/>\nmyself at home.  So we came up with other options.  Once those things were<br/>\ncleared out of the picture, the factors are such now that if Karl goes over<br/>\nthere, it&#39;s because he wants to be with those kids not because of some other<br/>\nthing or because he&#39;s tagging along with me or his dad, and there by<br/>\ndefault.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, the choice of one&#39;s friends is never really clear and a person<br/>\nfeels obliged to maintain friendships that in one&#39;s heart aren&#39;t truly one&#39;s<br/>\nown but choices born and fed by habit or misplaced virtue.  That is what<br/>\nhappens/ed to so many of us through school or church or club attendance.  An<br/>\nunschooled child can have much less of that kind of obligation, less<br/>\nfuzziness about what friendship really means and more clarity on true<br/>\nfriends, when parents provide room for choice, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Balance","postDate":"1238854114","msgId":43717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBNkUxOUFBLTJENUYtNEVGNy05RUQyLUZFMDRCMDZEODNDQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlDNzY2QUI1NDg2NDRGQjlBN0ZEOTMxNzA0ODIwODdGQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDE1NzY2Ni42MjkwNi5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw5Qzc2NkFCNTQ4NjQ0RkI5QTdGRDkzMTcwNDgyMDg3RkBSb2J5blBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":43712,"nextInTopic":43730,"prevInTime":43716,"nextInTime":43718,"topicId":43703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Longtime unschoolers here with teens talk about the kind of time they are spending with their teens, by the teens invitation and desire. -=- On Thursday","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-100767700\">-=-Longtime unschoolers here with teens talk about the kind of time  <br/>\nthey are<br/>\nspending with their teens, by the teens&#39; invitation and desire. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday Holly wanted to skateboard to the mall.  She&#39;s 17 and a  <br/>\nnew skateboarder.  I was worried that she would get hurt, or get too  <br/>\ntired.   The neighborhoods between here and there have driveway cuts  <br/>\nin the sidewalk, and she&#39;s not good enough to skate up and down those  <br/>\nangled cuts yet.   This was my angst.  She wasn&#39;t wearing long  <br/>\nsleeves.   But all I said was something like &quot;This is like Keith  <br/>\nriding the motorcycle; I worry, but I want you guys to have fun.&quot;  And  <br/>\nI told her if she wanted a ride home to call.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe took enough money for the bus.  She got to the mall even though  <br/>\nthe route she chose  was closed by serious construction (we had looked  <br/>\nat maps of bike paths, but none went safely to the mall for  <br/>\nskateboards).  I helped he with those things and she wanted me to.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe started home, and called for a ride, told me where she was and  <br/>\nthat she needed the bathroom.  I advised her about the nearest good  <br/>\npublic restroom which was also right near a place I could pick her up  <br/>\neasily.   I drove there, she was waiting on a bench, and she got in  <br/>\nthe car.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had gotten on a bus, but it had made a turn south and, afraid she  <br/>\nwas on the wrong bus, she got back off.   It was just going by the  <br/>\nother mall and would&#39;ve gone east again, but she didn&#39;t know.  I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t shame her about it at all.  I just told her that any bus driver  <br/>\nknows all the other routes and schedules in his own area too, and that  <br/>\nit&#39;s really okay to say, before putting the money in the till, &quot;I need  <br/>\nto get to Juan Tabo and Menaul&quot; or whatever.   Next time she&#39;s  <br/>\nplanning to try to take a bus by herself, I&#39;ll also talk to her about  <br/>\nasking for a transfer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, Friday, I had a horribly rough morning; a friend who was  <br/>\ncarrying twins lost one and I was assigned the job of letting our  <br/>\nfriends know.   I wasn&#39;t sure for several hours myself whether she had  <br/>\nlost both.  This came at a bad time for me for similar other reasons,  <br/>\nemotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Holly if she would drive me to the post office.  I had four  <br/>\npackages of copies of -Moving a Puddle- and/or Thinking Sticks to  <br/>\nmail.     Holly, a 17 year old girl with a car to drive, a skateboard  <br/>\nto ride and no school said &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe honestly would love to drive me to the post office.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not one of the things I foresaw when my kids were little. I  <br/>\nthought they would be &quot;typical teenagers&quot; at some point.  Holly is my  <br/>\nyoungest and they&#39;re all much different from typical teenagers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know a few unschooling families whose teens are not as sweet and  <br/>\nhappy as mine are.   Sometimes it&#39;s because of cynicism in the  <br/>\nfamilies or one parent never really participated in unschooling or  <br/>\nthere were still rules and chores and &quot;consequences&quot; (unnatural  <br/>\nconsequences &quot;imposed&quot; by the parents and then called &quot;natural  <br/>\nconsequences&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly drove me to the post office, even though I know how to drive  <br/>\nmyself.  We had fun even though the line was slow, smiling and waving  <br/>\nat people&#39;s babies and toddlers, and talking about the recent doings  <br/>\nof her La Cueva High School friends (she has a small group of friends  <br/>\nshe went to the homecoming dance with--limo ride and all--because she  <br/>\nknew one of the girls from the SCA and was invited into the group).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plan had been we would eat lunch and she would bring me right back  <br/>\nhome, but she cheered me up so much I was willing to stay out longer,  <br/>\nso we went to the mall and I bought her a pair of sandals from the  <br/>\nshoe store where her boyfriend works.  He sold them to us using a  <br/>\nfamily and friends discount.  I didn&#39;t want him to lose his commission  <br/>\nthat way, but he said the savings was bigger than the commission  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been.  We wandered around and shopped together in a very  <br/>\nleisurely and peaceful way.   She ran into a friend and former co- <br/>\nworker who was just about to interview at Industrial, another skater  <br/>\nshop.   She introduced me without any hesitation or embarrassment and  <br/>\nwe had a really nice talk while she was waiting, and we probably  <br/>\ncalmed her down and encouraged her for the interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing calm and positive is contagious.

The choice to unschool is a choice to be actively present <br/>\nand spend far, far more time with our own children than pretty much any <br/>\nother parenting philosophy, more than you think will be needed - and to <br/>\ncontinue to be present and spend far more time for longer than mainstream <br/>\nphilosophies would expect as our children age. My dd is 9 and she wants me <br/>\nto play with her and talk to her and sit near to her for what is probably <br/>\nclose to 10-12 hours every day other than when she has playdates (and I am <br/>\nusually nearby). She sleeps for 10, is awake for 16 (yes longer than 24 hour <br/>\ndays) but my point is the proportion of time is still huge.<br/>\n<br/>\nLongtime unschoolers here with teens talk about the kind of time they are <br/>\nspending with their teens, by the teens&#39; invitation and desire. They talk <br/>\nabout young adults living away who evidently still consider regular and <br/>\nmeaningful contact with their parents as essential to their own happiness. <br/>\nThis is the investment we are making with our little ones, and our middle <br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily Jayn and I have a lot of crossover interests. We do a lot together, <br/>\nincluding creative work, and she is more willing now to spend time with her <br/>\nfather, and he does take her off for several hours at a time intermittently, <br/>\nand I then write like crazy - which is what I &quot;do&quot; now - writing that is <br/>\ndefinitely an investment in long term future prosperity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can put in earplugs and write on the other side of the room when she has <br/>\ncertain kids over for playdates (those that tend not to need help with <br/>\nnegotiations) but there are other kids when I choose to be much more <br/>\nfocussed and I continue to listen more actively.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; it provides peer interaction for my younger daughter.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo would school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of Jayn&#39;s playmates and associates are in her life by her choice. They <br/>\nare not coming in to her home because I have brought them here for reasons <br/>\nof my own. Having a bunch of kids foisted on your child every day, who are <br/>\ninescapable in her own home, is not the same as allowing her to choose her <br/>\nplaymates from a crowd at the local home schooling park day, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It is a balancing act of meeting my business obligations, personal <br/>\nobligations and my children&#39;s needs.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other people unschooling and offering daycare in their home for <br/>\ngreater or fewer numbers of kids. I don&#39;t know how they do it. I&#39;m being <br/>\nreally honest here. It seems to me that you are saying you want help finding <br/>\nbalance, but maybe what you are really looking for is support in partly <br/>\nunschooling, because I don&#39;t know what really balancing a daycare and <br/>\nunschooling would look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know how daycare operators can give their own children the <br/>\nfocus and attention that real, flourishing, magical, successful unschooling <br/>\nseems to demand of me for my child when they are bringing any number of <br/>\nother children in to their home and being asked to realize the expectations <br/>\nof the other children&#39;s parents on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nPositives and negatives change when held up to the light of unschooling. <br/>\nPriorities change when examined through the lens of unschooling. It may be <br/>\nthat you will never see the full benefits of unschooling, or the full <br/>\namazing transcendent brilliance of natural learning moments while you are <br/>\nchoosing to run a daycare. It&#39;s a bit like the person on Sandra&#39;s site who <br/>\nwrote that &quot;unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional <br/>\nparenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a vegetarian for about 15 years. When I told people I was a vege, <br/>\nalmost invariably the first thing they would say is &quot;I don&#39;t eat much meat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d said it myself to my vege friends before making the change. It&#39;s wasn&#39;t <br/>\nuntil I actually stopped eating meat that I realized just how much meat was <br/>\nin my diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I was making dinner and told him yes, but could he wait till after dinner.  After dinner he wanted me to make some cookies and he wanted to help, so we did that.  Then I cleaned up while he played with his siblings.  Then he wanted to read me a book.  By this time I was tired and wanted to get in bed and read my email and watch a movie.  He on the other hand asked again about the dominoes.  Now, he is 6 and not 2 but I asked him nicely if he would not mind if we waited till morning because I was very tired.  He accepted this.  Today, I have built with legos with him, read to him, played Mario and Sonic at the Olympics and Rock Band, played house etc...    Therefore he was much more accepting of my request to wait till tomorrow than if we had done little together.
