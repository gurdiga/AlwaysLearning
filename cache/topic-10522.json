Perhaps I am arrogant to <br/>\nchoose a politically correct stance and cling to it with feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my thinking:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI HAVE seen families with shit for brains, and while I feel sorry for my <br/>\nkids, I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to hang around with them, nor to marry them, <br/>\nnor to work with or for them, nor to live in their neighborhoods.  [Some of <br/>\nthose families are my blood relatives, which might be about to cause my <br/>\ncurrent theory (not belief, not conviction) to bite its own tail.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I believe not taking a stand when one<br/>\nbelieves that harm will come from keeping silent is evil.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do too and have been in trouble more than once in this lifetime, starting <br/>\nat a young age, for saying &quot;That&#39;s not right&quot; to people who were my social <br/>\nsuperiors.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;A stand that forces others to bend their individual will to<br/>\nothers point of view against their individual experience would have the<br/>\npotential for great evil. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only times I&#39;ve had that power were when I was teaching 12-15 year olds <br/>\nin a public school, and when I became a parent.  I think perhaps my many <br/>\nyears of being in the decision making seat with great evil on one side and <br/>\nwhat I saw as my duty on the other have made me arrogant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO... mathematicians and programmers here, please:   What are our number of <br/>\noptions here?  Let me not suggest a model that&#39;s as pig-ignorant as &quot;either <br/>\nevolution or six day creation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many combinations of factors are we considering, just in a simple summary <br/>\nof current options?  I&#39;m not a logician and I might have duplicates, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re not probably arranged perfectly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nborn in sin / innocent<br/>\n<br/>\nspanking / no spanking<br/>\n<br/>\ninbred intelligence / empty vessel<br/>\n<br/>\nattachment parenting / techno parenting by the clock<br/>\n<br/>\nadversary / partner<br/>\n<br/>\nbreastfeeding or attempted / unconcerned with even trying<br/>\n<br/>\ndaycare / no daycare<br/>\n<br/>\npreschool / no preschool<br/>\n<br/>\nschool / homeschool<br/>\n<br/>\ncurriculum / no curriculum<br/>\n<br/>\nteaching / natural learning<br/>\n<br/>\nrules / principles<br/>\n<br/>\nmore control / less control<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a bad set of criteria because there are some (many?) which will <br/>\nexclude or prevent others.  Maybe that&#39;s just the way multiple sets of <br/>\ncriteria go.<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;I believe and so must you unthinkingly,&quot; is different from &quot;I believe this<br/>\nand I want you to think about it too.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI never even did that when I was teaching.<br/>\nMaybe I haven&#39;t been so close to evil as my conscience sometimes thinks I <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10513,"nextTopicId":10523}}
