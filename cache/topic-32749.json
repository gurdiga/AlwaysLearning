I usually read him to sleep or lie with him, (he breasfed to sleep until 15 months). Until about a year ago we had a set bedtime and routine and since then we have been more relaxed about staying up later. Recently he has been wanting to carry on playing or watching beyond the time that I want to go to bed myself but he cannot and does not want to go to sleep by himself. If I stay up late so that I can read to him when he is ready I will be grumpy the next day so I have insisted that he finish watching or playing so that I can read to him and then go to bed, even though he always asks for &#39;just one more&#39;. Tonight he wanted to try watching the iPad in bed and go to sleep by himself, but was unable to which meant that I got out of bed to go tuck him in, etc. <br/>\nSo I am looking for ideas how I can manage this peacefully when he doesn&#39;t want to stop watching what he is enjoying but needs me to sleep. He is usually so tired by the time I start reading that he hears little of the story but the sound of my voice is enough to send him off. <br/>\nBTW He likes to go to sleep in his own bed but usually comes to ours in the wee hours of the morning. On the occasion that he has slept all night in our bed we have none of us had a good nights sleep.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nSara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":121442839,"authorName":"Susan Reeve","from":"Susan Reeve &lt;ksreeve@...&gt;","profile":"ksreeve","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Sleep","postDate":"1204779768","msgId":32749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMzRjRFNTI4LjExNTNEJWtzcmVldmVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74177,"prevInTime":32748,"nextInTime":32750,"topicId":32749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Scientific American Mind - February, 2008 Irritable?

Take a Nap<br/>\nSleep deprivation leads to heightened emotions<br/>\nBy Katherine Leitzel<br/>\n <br/>\nParents of toddlers have known for years that tired kids have trouble<br/>\ncontrolling their emotions. But recent findings from neuroscientists at<br/>\nHarvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, extend far<br/>\nbeyond temperamental tykes. After the researchers kept adult volunteers<br/>\nawake for about 35 hours, they found with MRI scans that sleep deprivation<br/>\nimpairs the ³rational² prefrontal cortex¹s control over the amygdala, the<br/>\nbrain¹s emotion center. The result is the moodiness that often accompanies<br/>\nexhaustion, described by the team as an amplified response from the brain¹s<br/>\nemotion hub. The study also suggested that sleep deprivation interferes with<br/>\nthe ability of the prefrontal cortex to make logical decisions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74176,"nextTopicId":74184}}
