The leader has a lot of freedom in running the troop, so a girl&#39;s experience really will depend on the leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I sat through my leader training, they discouraged mixed age troops.  I spoke up several times to say that our troop was mixed and that it was working well for us.  We&#39;ve always had brownies and juniors, and one year had daisies in addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur last two years we had girls aged 6 to 11.  Our troop had public-, private-, and homeschooled members.  Next year we are switching to a cooperative and all homeschooled troop that will be brownie, junior, and cadet.  We have enjoyed having the schooled girls in the troop, but being all homeschooled will allow us to schedule things during school hours.  Being cooperative will allow us more flexibility in activities and will spread the leader - load.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I hate selling things, I will say that people seem to love buying girl scout cookies.  The council encourages us to sell as many as possible, but there is no pressure.  We are not even required to sell them.  But our troop members want to.  We use the money for troop supplies and for special events that the girls choose.  They have used the money to go rock climbing, horse vaulting, swimming, to a ceramics studio, bowling, mini-golf, and a pizza party.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably my biggest dislike of girls scouts is the way that rewards are used.  The girls get prizes for selling cookies and they get badges for completing activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to share ideas (pros and cons) with others interested in girl scouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Girl Scouts","postDate":"1055781858","msgId":15108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMy5iM2UzNjU0LjJjMWY0ZGUyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15107,"nextInTopic":15110,"prevInTime":15107,"nextInTime":15109,"topicId":15080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/15/03 10:45:18 PM, pamsoroosh@mac.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1128624223\">In a message dated 6/15/03 10:45:18 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; 4H seems to get better as kids get older - has more of an unschooling <br/>\nnature to it, too.

They say they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; want girls to learn leadership and independence, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then they have the girls fundraise for the Council.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Girl Scouts keep anywhere from 30 cents to 50 cents a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; box for the cookies they sell.  Not exactly a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; business deal.  Selling cookies is a tremendous amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of work...as well as a tremendous liability...because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you have to send Council the money on the due date<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whether the troop sold the boxes or not.  They want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you to order hundreds extra and do booths, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sometimes you have good sales and sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The Councils also have so many rules and regulations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whew! They can overwhelm leaders at times.  Ah hem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My assistant and I do break quite a few though at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; times! ; )<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am having a senior&#39;s moment....the woman who did the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reptile show for our homeschool group...can&#39;t remember<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; her name, but anyway, she wanted to display and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discuss venomous and non-venomous snakes at a Girl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Scout workshop for leaders.  She said she didn&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to take up anyone&#39;s time.  But people could&#39;ve looked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at them during the breaks.  They told her that snakes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; weren&#39;t allowed at the camp.  She told me that she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t help laughing and asked the Council if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thought there weren&#39;t any snakes at the camp.  They<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; told her that snakes were too traumatic for many women<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and girls.  In fact, that Council doesn&#39;t want you to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; say snake if you see one. You have to call it in on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the walkie-talkie and say, &quot;I have spotted Mr.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No-Shoulders.&quot;  The reptile woman...smile...I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stand it when I can&#39;t remember people&#39;s names... said<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; she wouldn&#39;t have believed it if she hadn&#39;t heard it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; herself. She said instead of teaching the leaders<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about snakes, and there are plenty at the camp, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; leaders learned how to make a campfire using candy. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; laughed hysterically because we did the same thing at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; my training!!  I live in the Low Country, so I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have loved to have been up close with a diamondback<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rattler so I would know what it looked like in case my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; troop and I come across one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A service unit on another occasion had asked her to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; workshops for their weekend camp for girls.  She said<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; she thought it would be better if she taught the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cadettes and then they could teach the other girls.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; She would be more of a mentor.  She said she had no<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desire to be the sage on the stage.  She thought this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was about girls and leadership.  Apparently not!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, the leaders of the service unit decided to call<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the weekend Creepy Crawly Thangs.  She said that she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; told them that she had hoped that she could talk with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the girls before a title was picked, but they said no.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; She bowed out because she said a lot of folks in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; state kill everything that moves as it is...and if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something is creepy and crawly and a THANG, then they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really will kill it.  She said she knows that she will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; never get asked to do anything again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; All this to say that you gotta remember that if you do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Girl Scouts that there are headaches too.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; headaches were more around the cookie sales.  We sold<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; so many boxes and got so little money back.  The other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing is that the paperwork is voluminous.  Truly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; voluminous.  Then, even if your girls vote on a field<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trip or activity, then some Councils insist everything<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; goes through them.  There can&#39;t be much spontaneity<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because there are deadlines and usually they are a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; month to 3 weeks in advance of the event.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My Council prefers that troops be all the same age.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is very different from Boy Scouts where the older<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; boys can role model and teach the younger ones.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My assistant and I always let our girls decide stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If someone doesn&#39;t want to do something, we help them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find the resource people or whatever to do what they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; want.  There aren&#39;t as many cadette and Senior troops<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as there are Brownies and Juniors.  Girls won&#39;t stay<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in an organization that tells them what to do all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time or puts limits on everything.  My troop wants me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to convert our troop to a Boy Scout Venturers group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; when they all turn 14.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There was something else I was going to say...I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I need an herb for memory!!  Oh, I know.  Some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Councils have their own political agenda. I am pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberal myself, but I am not into trying to convince<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anyone else to believe what I believe or what Council<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; believes.  They sent out this letter that encouraged<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; us not to support Bush. I don&#39;t think it is right for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; me to express my views on Presidential candidates.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now I wouldn&#39;t be against having the girls discuss how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one evaluates candidates.  This is just one example.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There were other political issues that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; controversial that I avoid...like abortion.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; want to tell my girls what to think.  I would rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; teach them how to evaluate positions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, that is my two cents...or was that ten?...on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Girl Scouting!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rachel Minninger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SBC Yahoo!

I am a Girl Scout leader, and I have not always been happy with the Girl Scout Councils.

They say they<br/>\nwant girls to learn leadership and independence, but<br/>\nthen they have the girls fundraise for the Council. <br/>\nGirl Scouts keep anywhere from 30 cents to 50 cents a<br/>\nbox for the cookies they sell.  Not exactly a great<br/>\nbusiness deal.  Selling cookies is a tremendous amount<br/>\nof work...as well as a tremendous liability...because<br/>\nyou have to send Council the money on the due date<br/>\nwhether the troop sold the boxes or not.  They want<br/>\nyou to order hundreds extra and do booths, but<br/>\nsometimes you have good sales and sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Councils also have so many rules and regulations. <br/>\nWhew! They can overwhelm leaders at times.  Ah hem. <br/>\nMy assistant and I do break quite a few though at<br/>\ntimes! ; )<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having a senior&#39;s moment....the woman who did the<br/>\nreptile show for our homeschool group...can&#39;t remember<br/>\nher name, but anyway, she wanted to display and<br/>\ndiscuss venomous and non-venomous snakes at a Girl<br/>\nScout workshop for leaders.  She said she didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto take up anyone&#39;s time.  But people could&#39;ve looked<br/>\nat them during the breaks.  They told her that snakes<br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed at the camp.  She told me that she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t help laughing and asked the Council if they<br/>\nthought there weren&#39;t any snakes at the camp.  They<br/>\ntold her that snakes were too traumatic for many women<br/>\nand girls.  In fact, that Council doesn&#39;t want you to<br/>\nsay snake if you see one. You have to call it in on<br/>\nthe walkie-talkie and say, &quot;I have spotted Mr.<br/>\nNo-Shoulders.&quot;  The reptile woman...smile...I can&#39;t<br/>\nstand it when I can&#39;t remember people&#39;s names... said<br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t have believed it if she hadn&#39;t heard it<br/>\nherself. She said instead of teaching the leaders<br/>\nabout snakes, and there are plenty at the camp, the<br/>\nleaders learned how to make a campfire using candy. I<br/>\nlaughed hysterically because we did the same thing at<br/>\nmy training!!  I live in the Low Country, so I would<br/>\nhave loved to have been up close with a diamondback<br/>\nrattler so I would know what it looked like in case my<br/>\ntroop and I come across one.<br/>\n<br/>\nA service unit on another occasion had asked her to do<br/>\nworkshops for their weekend camp for girls.  She said<br/>\nshe thought it would be better if she taught the<br/>\ncadettes and then they could teach the other girls. <br/>\nShe would be more of a mentor.  She said she had no<br/>\ndesire to be the sage on the stage.  She thought this<br/>\nwas about girls and leadership.  Apparently not!<br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the leaders of the service unit decided to call<br/>\nthe weekend Creepy Crawly Thangs.  She said that she<br/>\ntold them that she had hoped that she could talk with<br/>\nthe girls before a title was picked, but they said no.<br/>\n She bowed out because she said a lot of folks in our<br/>\nstate kill everything that moves as it is...and if<br/>\nsomething is creepy and crawly and a THANG, then they<br/>\nreally will kill it.  She said she knows that she will<br/>\nnever get asked to do anything again. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this to say that you gotta remember that if you do<br/>\nGirl Scouts that there are headaches too.  My<br/>\nheadaches were more around the cookie sales.  We sold<br/>\nso many boxes and got so little money back.  The other<br/>\nthing is that the paperwork is voluminous.  Truly<br/>\nvoluminous.  Then, even if your girls vote on a field<br/>\ntrip or activity, then some Councils insist everything<br/>\ngoes through them.  There can&#39;t be much spontaneity<br/>\nbecause there are deadlines and usually they are a<br/>\nmonth to 3 weeks in advance of the event.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Council prefers that troops be all the same age. <br/>\nThis is very different from Boy Scouts where the older<br/>\nboys can role model and teach the younger ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy assistant and I always let our girls decide stuff.<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t want to do something, we help them<br/>\nfind the resource people or whatever to do what they<br/>\nwant.  There aren&#39;t as many cadette and Senior troops<br/>\nas there are Brownies and Juniors.  Girls won&#39;t stay<br/>\nin an organization that tells them what to do all the<br/>\ntime or puts limits on everything.  My troop wants me<br/>\nto convert our troop to a Boy Scout Venturers group<br/>\nwhen they all turn 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was something else I was going to say...I think<br/>\nI need an herb for memory!!  Oh, I know.  Some<br/>\nCouncils have their own political agenda. I am pretty<br/>\nliberal myself, but I am not into trying to convince<br/>\nanyone else to believe what I believe or what Council<br/>\nbelieves.  They sent out this letter that encouraged<br/>\nus not to support Bush. I don&#39;t think it is right for<br/>\nme to express my views on Presidential candidates. <br/>\nNow I wouldn&#39;t be against having the girls discuss how<br/>\none evaluates candidates.  This is just one example.  <br/>\nThere were other political issues that are<br/>\ncontroversial that I avoid...like abortion.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to tell my girls what to think.  I would rather<br/>\nteach them how to evaluate positions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that is my two cents...or was that ten?...on<br/>\nGirl Scouting!<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Minninger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
