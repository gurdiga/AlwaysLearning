In Austin we had lots of friends of all ages, and a great unschooling community.  Now, here, we have lots of opportunities to be in different unschooling-heavy groups/organizations/activities/park days, but my daughter doesn&#39;t want to participate.  She has always been the social butterfly.  She gets along and likes everyone from newborns to 97 year-olds and all the ages in between, but suddenly she doesn&#39;t want to go out.  She&#39;s not depressed.  She&#39;s just as happy as she&#39;s ever been.  She now lives in a house instead of an apartment.  Occasionally she has said things about making new friends and we&#39;ll discuss the options and requirements (like meeting times) and then she goes off to do something.  Later I&#39;ll bring it up and she&#39;ll say she&#39;s still getting used to her new house.  So, I&#39;m trying not to push it.  I&#39;m enjoying the time we&#39;re spending together, but I must admit that I miss the camaraderie of the unschooling moms once a week at park days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to your concern, I think you should let your kids be your guide in this.  Offer different opportunities as you come to learn about them, but let the children decide if they&#39;d like to partake.  When something strikes their fancy, they&#39;ll want to participate.  Don&#39;t worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nNichole<br/>\nMargaux (7)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] question: i&#39;m feeling pressure to socialize more","postDate":"1095467656","msgId":20853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VIRUNKQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNpZmE2OSs5MTVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20849,"nextInTopic":20858,"prevInTime":20852,"nextInTime":20854,"topicId":20846,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But my memories of the period of time that you are talking<br/>\nabout are mostly at home, keeping everyone safe and happy, delighting in the<br/>\nthings they came up with (my first two were 14 months apart and played<br/>\ntogether nonstop as well) and resting any moment I could. I do remember<br/>\nfeeling tired all of the time too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of time for socializing. And they already are socializing<br/>\nwith each other!
