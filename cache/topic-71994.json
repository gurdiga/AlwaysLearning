I m going","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-195246243\">I love all these ideas about the relationship between the flag and the quote.  None of them are what I was thinking, but they&#39;re all just as valid!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to discuss it in the chat on Wednesday, so any more connections or ideas would be very welcome.  One thing I was thinking is that some people might think that having a boat and going to those places is virtuous, but being on the internet is sin and sloth.  But without the internet, people wouldn&#39;t be able to see that flag without happening to be where the boat was.  There was nobody around that day, or I might&#39;ve asked them about the flag.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upper left is Bretagne/Brittany (a region of France), which I know because Schuyler&#39;s family went there with me to visit my friend Helene a couple of years ago.  I have a plastic shopping bag with that on it, and it has holders inside for baquettes, or wine bottles, or both.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2013/08/dont-miss-it.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2013/08/dont-miss-it.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe center is for the Isle of Man, I think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLower left is Ireland.  Lower right is Wales.  Upper right is 1/4 of St. Andrew&#39;s cross, which represents Scotland. Center bottom is Cornwall.  James Daniel told me that one.    The upper center, I don&#39;t know.  Maybe it&#39;s personal, or reference to a business.  Maybe someone here will know (or know someone who will know).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just favorite places of the boat owners, or maybe places they&#39;ve lived, or maybe it&#39;s a time-share boat, and the owners are from those places.  I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any such thing as a time-share boat. :-)   But one day it was in Liverpool, and so was I.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266347231,"authorName":"Annie Regan","from":"Annie Regan &lt;anniel_5@...&gt;","profile":"anniel_5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Connect and disconnect","postDate":"1377031273","msgId":72005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBQzg3QTQ2LTZBNzItNDM4MS05RjhCLUUwN0FDM0I5OTYxN0B5YWhvby5jb20uYXU+"},"prevInTopic":72000,"nextInTopic":72006,"prevInTime":72004,"nextInTime":72006,"topicId":71994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The flag seemed to have bits of national flags from a range of countries - and some bits that may or may not be from national flags, I didn t recognise them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-370125122\">The flag seemed to have bits of national flags from a range of countries - and some bits that may or may not be from national flags, I didn&#39;t recognise them all.

That&#39;s a pretty colourful flag!&quot;  Now, that I look at it more closely, I see a lot of things going on in there.  Things, that if I was planning a flag, I might not think should go together.  If I was really attached to the style of the Canadian flag, or the Japanese flag, or the American flag, I might think this flag has too much going on.  But, it&#39;s wonderfully complex.  I don&#39;t think I, personally, can know everything that&#39;s going on in the flag--the relevance of everything.  I&#39;m not sure I need to know to enjoy it.

What I love about this flag (and I&#39;m not someone<br/>\nwho is any kind of expert on flags of other countries or ship flags etc) is<br/>\nthat there is a lot going on on this flag.  It seems to be a combination of<br/>\nat least 6 flags all connected by a symbol that looks sort of like a gear,<br/>\nor a wheel or something from the far east or maybe...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet is like that middle symbol - a central location or portal, if<br/>\nyou will, that can &quot;take you&quot; to places through words, pictures, and images<br/>\nall over the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like there is a dragon on the flag in the lower right corner and<br/>\nit reminds me of old maps where as they got to the edges of their &quot;known<br/>\nuniverse&quot; the cartographers would put pictures of sea monsters and<br/>\nsometimes even words that said things like &quot;there monsters be....&quot;  A lot<br/>\nof people feel that way about the internet - they have their areas of<br/>\ncomfort, Gmail, Yahoo, Facebook, Wikipedia, Amazon (not the<br/>\njungle/rainforest...) but know that if not careful you can click into<br/>\ndangerous territory (sort of like taking a wrong turn and ending up lost in<br/>\na bad neighborhood late at night).  A lot of parents fear the internet -<br/>\nlike it&#39;s a bad neighborhood filled with predators and pedophiles around<br/>\nevery corner, trolling xbox live games, giving out &quot;free lives&quot; on candy<br/>\ncrush saga and armor and supplies in World of Warcraft....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flag also seems to be a loud noisy jumble of colors and patterns.<br/>\n Computers can be that too.  Sometimes my computer is a crazy quilt of text<br/>\nand images and music and maps....right now I have seven windows open on<br/>\nthis laptop,  The Just Add Light window with the picture of the flag, my<br/>\nemail, a wikipedia page on the history of the barber pole, two Youtube<br/>\nvideo pages (one Minecraft walkthrough video, and a room tour put up by a<br/>\ntween girl who is showing off her hamster cage and holiday decorations) a<br/>\nmap with directions to someplace in NY State, and Facebook. Those windows<br/>\ndo a pretty good job of covering time and space and people I know, close<br/>\nfriends and family, people who are living and dead, and some people I only<br/>\nknow through words and pictures, and pixels blinking on a screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Aug 19, 2013 at 2:30 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; For anyone who doesn&#39;t see an image, please click this link:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2013/08/dont-miss-it.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2013/08/dont-miss-it.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have two things to tie this two.
