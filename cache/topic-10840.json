Saturday&#39;s take<br/>\n&gt;balanced, but nothing did when I added up all the sales. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;::whew:::  Now I just have to deal with the girl&#39;s propensity to ask people<br/>\n&gt;for money for herself.  I realize this is a cultural issue--she&#39;s a different<br/>\n&gt;race than me.  It happens to me on occasion, little kids--strangers to<br/>\n&gt;me--approaching me and asking for quarters or dollars.  Even had a boy about<br/>\n&gt;9 come up and ask me if he could have a piece of our pizza!  I find it rude<br/>\n&gt;and obnoxious, and realize that others might feel differently.  But what is<br/>\n&gt;that about?  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tuck<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10824,"nextTopicId":10686}}
