You can do <br/>\nthat from the Start button, or just press the windows key (between ctrl and <br/>\nalt) at the same time as E.  Once there, it&#39;s easy to navigate to the files <br/>\nyou want to work with.  To copy, delete, or rename, just put the cursor on <br/>\nthe file and right click.  You&#39;ll get a menu that includes all those.  If <br/>\nyou click on rename, it will put a box around the file, and you just type <br/>\nin the new name and press enter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the Barnes and Noble course, there are *tons* of sites that <br/>\nteach web page design.  If you search on &quot;web page design&quot;, you&#39;ll probably <br/>\nfind lots.  Another way to learn is to view the source code of pages you <br/>\nlike.  Click on view and then source.  You&#39;ll see all the html code.  Try <br/>\nto figure out how they&#39;ve done stuff that way.
