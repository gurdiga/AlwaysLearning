When she was 3 she told me she would start using the potty to poop. Her 4th birthday came and went in October, and she still will poop only in a diaper. Now she tells me she will poop in the potty before she turns 5. Of course, I am hopeful!  I have bit my tongue more times than I care for so that I don&#39;t say all the variety of things I could say to her regarding pooping in the potty. On occasion, I have let her know that I look forward to the day I don&#39;t have to wipe her bum in the way that I must when she poops in a diaper, which requires more effort than pooping in the potty. She tells me she likes to poop in the diaper because she still wants to be a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cope with this by knowing that she won&#39;t be pooping in a diaper for much longer. As many have told me, she won&#39;t be dating in diapers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only advice I can offer is to just know it won&#39;t last forever.

I thought I was going to go nuts with impatience and couldn&#39;t figure out why he wasn&#39;t ready? what would ready look like? what was my role? etc etc.  Then, a few weeks after his fourth birthday, he spent most of the day with a 3 year old friend of his and came home that day and was done with diapers completely. He then had 2 weeks of daily pants-pooping which almost drove me over the edge since I was dealing with a colicky (5-6 hours a day of inconsolable screaming) baby. One morning I watched him like a hawk for signs he needed to poop, then went to make lunch and he pooped the minute I left the room.  I didn&#39;t handle it well and got very upset, but something clicked in him and he &quot;got it&quot; about pooping in the toilet too.  Now it&#39;s been 3ish months and he hasn&#39;t had a single day time accident and only one night time accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in short, I will feel more comfortable about letting my next 2 do it in their own time because once it happened, it was effortless and free of accidents and trauma.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\njames 2005<br/>\ntyler 2007<br/>\naudrey 2009<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry Gigi hijacked and sent my message !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was saying that my kids used the potty very early but had many accidents along the way.<br/>\n&gt; My sister&#39;s boys  started using when they were 4 and older and  it was a like one day they woke up and decided they were done and never had accidents.<br/>\n&gt; So you maybe be done with diapers but running around  with extra clothes and worried about accidents that can happen anywhere!. <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps your perspective!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alex Polikowsky<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":352545834,"authorName":"tiffermom@comcast.net","from":"tiffermom@...","profile":"tiffermomof5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Learning to use the toilet","postDate":"1260642193","msgId":49118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1MTg0MzU0NC40MjA3NjcxMjYwNjQyMTkzNzI0LkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAc3owMDM5YS5lbWVyeXZpbGxlLmNhLm1haWwuY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4OTMwMzgzLUQ2RjYtNDVENy1BMTE4LUNEODY5QzBBNjcyOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49115,"nextInTopic":49122,"prevInTime":49117,"nextInTime":49119,"topicId":49089,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-Some kids don t try to ride a bike until they are able to do all the bike riding bits, and basically get on and go.

We made nighttime adjustments since this was before the<br/>\nmarketing of  larger pull-ups. The only time he had &quot;accidents&quot; in the<br/>\ndaytime was when he was asleep or so sick and feverish that he might as well<br/>\nhave been sleeping.     I had another son who stayed dry at night before age<br/>\ntwo.  If he was wearing a diaper it would be dry when he awoke but within 20<br/>\nminutes it would be saggingly soggy.     When I remembered, I would suggest<br/>\nthat he try to empty his bladder into the toilet or outside but it was more<br/>\nmy knowing that the flood was coming than him being able to control it or<br/>\nrecognizing when he &quot;needed to go&quot;.
