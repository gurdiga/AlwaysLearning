We can&#39;t say &quot;Wait!  Don&#39;t change anything at your  <br/>\nhouse until we&#39;re sure  you really know what you&#39;re doing!&quot;  There  <br/>\nhave been some dismal reports of what happened when the mom read her  <br/>\na while, turned around and said &quot;No more bedtimes!  No more chores!   <br/>\nEat TWINKIES!&quot;   And when her kids passed out midmorning on a pile of  <br/>\ndirty laundry with ants eating twinkie-cream off their fingers, she  <br/>\nseemed angry with some of us, because we&#39;d  written here and there  <br/>\nthat we didn&#39;t have bedtimes, didn&#39;t require chores, and our kids  <br/>\ncould eat what they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome years back there were two or three moms who were &quot;accusing&quot; me  <br/>\nof telling people they couldn&#39;t unschool.  That would only work if I  <br/>\nhad the power to declare that a person COULD unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople come and tell us all the time that they can or can&#39;t  <br/>\nunschool.  Sometimes they say &quot;I am unschooling but....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they&#39;re unschooling because they say they are, or they think they  <br/>\nare, but then they tell US they can&#39;t unschool by going into detail  <br/>\nabout how they can&#39;t trust their kids to learn to read or do math, or  <br/>\nthey are unschooling but their husband doesn&#39;t agree to it, but they  <br/>\nare unschooling after school and on weekends, or they&#39;re unschooling  <br/>\nin the summers, before school starts again, or they&#39;re unschooling  <br/>\nbut the kids need to do workbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat says clear as day &quot;I am not and cannot do what you&#39;re all  <br/>\ntalking about, but I want to go around chirping &#39;We&#39;re UNschoolers!&#39;  <br/>\nregardless of the fact that I don&#39;t get and and am indicating as  <br/>\nclear as day that I don&#39;t want to get it or don&#39;t really think  <br/>\nthere&#39;s anything TO get.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI say people like that can&#39;t unschool.  When I say that, I&#39;m just  <br/>\nagreeing with them, basically.  They&#39;re in one huge exhale of chatter  <br/>\nand justification and wall-of-sound, without any inhale expected.   <br/>\nThey can&#39;t take info in because they&#39;re blowing so much out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome go the other way.  They say &quot;I can&#39;t unschool because my kids  <br/>\nwould never open a book, they would watch TV all day if I let them,  <br/>\nthey would never get out of bed, they would never learn to make  <br/>\nchange or wipe their own asses if they didn&#39;t go to school&quot;  Why  <br/>\npeople come and tell us things like that, I&#39;m not sure.  I think they  <br/>\nwant us to say &quot;That&#39;s okay.  Your kids will be just as happy as ours  <br/>\nare.&quot;  They want some kind of absolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey come to tell us they can&#39;t do what we do, but they want something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26829,"nextTopicId":26700}}
