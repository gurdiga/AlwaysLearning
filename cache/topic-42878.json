Karl isn&#39;t like that at 5<br/>\nbut I was.  Of course I was going to kindergarten so I didn&#39;t have any<br/>\noption but to be around kids I didn&#39;t want to be around.  One cute kid<br/>\n(somehow a picture was taken .. dunno how) declared himself my<br/>\nboyfriend and I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him!  I<br/>\ndistinctly remember outside at recess he marched around the basketball<br/>\ncourt with a little troupe of boys behind him while holding a broom<br/>\nbefore him (used to knock a stuck basketball out of the hoop) and at<br/>\nthe top of his lungs shouted &quot;I&#39;m gonna marry you!&quot; over and over<br/>\nagain.  I was so annoyed and exasperated, and that&#39;s why I have such a<br/>\nclear memory of it.  He liked me and I wasn&#39;t ready for boys to be<br/>\npaying attention to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I look back and it&#39;s a fun little episode in my very young life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had totally got over my aversion by the time I was 11 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Should I try something different now?","postDate":"1236068568","msgId":42885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvaXBjbysyY2NlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvaWFjNitnZmdnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42878,"nextInTopic":42888,"prevInTime":42884,"nextInTime":42886,"topicId":42878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Role play so that you can help him find ways to react that will be more respectful of the <br/>\ngirls he encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd had a friend, when she was 5, who had no use for boys because of the same <br/>\nexperience your son had.  She was not very nice to my son for a long time, but we kept <br/>\nworking on it because she wanted to come over to play with my dd.  We lived quite a <br/>\ndistance apart, so playdates alone were rarely an option in our case.  She finally tolerated <br/>\nhis presence, and now she considers him one of her good friends, and he&#39;s always invited <br/>\nto her birthday parties.

I need advice with my 7yo. son. For a long time now he gets<br/>\nvery upset whenever another kid looks at him. Girls that is! In the<br/>\npast when we took him to the playground and he &quot;freaked out&quot; if other<br/>\nkids were there. I would honor his feelings,ask him if he wanted to<br/>\nleave or keep him near me. Sometimes,slowly,he would get used to them<br/>\nand join in play. He gets extremely upset if a girl looks at him. Like<br/>\ntoday in Bealls,he was in the cart and a girl came around the aisle<br/>\nand he stood up and yelled: She&#39;s looking at me!! I held him and said<br/>\n&quot;it&#39;s okay&quot; and she left and he was glad. Later,I asked him what he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like and he only said girls looking at him. I told him people<br/>\nlook,that he looked at her right? She&#39;s not going to hurt you. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t offer up much info but i did ask him what we can do to help<br/>\nhim and he says keep them away. I said they do have a right to walk<br/>\naround the store.A few years back we were at the park with my friend<br/>\nwho has two little girls and one walked up to him and hit him so he<br/>\nnow has a fear of that happening again.I said it&#39;s probably not going<br/>\nto happen again,trying to reassure him.<br/>\nMy Husband thinks he needs MORE exposure to kids and said even if we<br/>\nleft him alone with some.
