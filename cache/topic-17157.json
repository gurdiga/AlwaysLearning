His teacher got it, the <br/>\nprincipal didn&#39;t hence the small problem at the end of the year, easily resolved <br/>\nwith a smart letter. We are still very good friends with his teacher and see <br/>\nher often, and both kids have adopted her parents who live a few blocks away, <br/>\nas surrogate grandparents. Better than Darin&#39;s mom who lives less than an hour <br/>\naway and almost as good as mine who can&#39;t be closer, but wish they could. So <br/>\neveryone won in this situation except for the principal. &lt;g&gt; His teacher and I <br/>\ntalk at least once a week and she even uses some of my ideas in her <br/>\nclassroom.
