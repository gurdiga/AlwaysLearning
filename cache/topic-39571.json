What made it even more difficult is that I would allow those<br/>\nbehaviors when he wasn&#39;t home and so when he came home and said NO, they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t listen because they always did those things.

I know what I&#39;m not supposed to do, and have<br/>\nthe concept of what I&#39;m aiming for, but I get lost in all the specifics.<br/>\nI went back and key-word searched for some ideas, read a few more pages<br/>\non Sandra&#39;s site (some I read before, some I didn&#39;t) and I&#39;m still<br/>\ncoming up short. This is one area I really wish I had more examples of<br/>\nin my own life to use when I need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, first of would be my son. He&#39;s four and he&#39;s absolutely wonderful.<br/>\nHe is full of life and energy and happiness; is helpful and<br/>\ncompassionate, and just a joy to be around. But when he gets upset,<br/>\nwhich tends to be fairly easily, and quite often, he goes off quickly<br/>\nand loudly. He doesn&#39;t throw a kicking tantrum, and doesn&#39;t hurt things<br/>\nor other people when he&#39;s mad, he just cries loudly. I tried a few times<br/>\nto get him to breathe with me, but he doesn&#39;t want to, and I feel like<br/>\nI&#39;m just forcing an idea on him that he doesn&#39;t understand. He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike to look at me in the eye when he&#39;s in this state.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I just want to help him learn to calm down, be patient, and<br/>\nwhatever it is that he&#39;s mad about we can talk about and figure out.<br/>\nHe&#39;s always been more dramatic in his anger versus his other feelings,<br/>\nbut lately it&#39;s become a constant everyday thing. When his sister takes<br/>\na toy away, or won&#39;t share. When he wants to do something RIGHT NOW and<br/>\nwe just can&#39;t. Very good reasons to feel angry, but it tears me up when<br/>\nhe cries so hard and shuts us out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of it is that he is wanting to be in control of his world,<br/>\nand though I help him with that as much as possible (he gets his own<br/>\nfood, puts on clothes, opens and closes van doors, etc) there are still<br/>\nso many things that he can&#39;t do - like drive to the store on the<br/>\nhighway. We used to have a long driveway we&#39;d let his sister drive down<br/>\nbut now we live in town and don&#39;t get that chance as often.  But even<br/>\nwhen I let him have something he really wants, it doesn&#39;t stop him from<br/>\nwanting it again, now, already.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of it is giving him more &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; than &quot;no&#39;s&quot;, but sometimes<br/>\nit seems like there&#39;s just not enough &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; for him. My daughter isn&#39;t<br/>\nlike this, so it&#39;s new for me. She&#39;s challenged me in many other ways :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing is deferring negative behavior in general. When I first<br/>\nbegan understanding &quot;radical&quot; unschooling (apart from academic) I<br/>\nfinally began to grasp that it&#39;s not letting your kids do whatever they<br/>\nwant all the time, which is how I first understood the term. Safety is<br/>\nstill in place, and it&#39;s more about not limiting their choices to a box<br/>\nthan it is giving them the whole world at their fingertips to get lost<br/>\nin. I loved Sandra&#39;s &quot;balance&quot; page...perfect for how I&#39;m feeling,<br/>\ntrying to find that balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with APing, I already don&#39;t spank, and I don&#39;t do time out. But to be<br/>\nhonest, I still haven&#39;t figured out quite what I should do when the kids<br/>\ndo something that simply isn&#39;t acceptable (hitting one another, grabbing<br/>\ntoys, etc.)  Luckily, either I&#39;m doing some things right, or I have<br/>\npretty good kids, but we don&#39;t have a lot of issues with this. But when<br/>\nwe do, I feel powerlesss, guilty, and unsure of what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight the kids were jumping on the couch. Now, if it was a new couch<br/>\nthen maybe I wouldn&#39;t let them do this, but to be honest the jumping<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really bother me. It does bother DH only because he&#39;s afraid of<br/>\nthe kids getting hurt, and maybe he doesn&#39;t like the noise involved, but<br/>\notherwise it isn&#39;t the jumping on the couches that he disapproved of,<br/>\nit&#39;s the manner in which they were jumping which could result in someone<br/>\ngetting hurt. (other things they do turn out the same way - they are<br/>\nkids, afterall! But running, dancing, etc....)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he had asked them to stop. And maybe asked them again (I was in the<br/>\nkitchen doing dishes, so heard the commotion, but not his requests - he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t shout them.) But they kept jumping (because we used to threaten<br/>\nwith spankings, though we didn&#39;t actually spank anymore, and so formally<br/>\nhe would have threatened them and they would have stopped) and as has<br/>\nhappened before, one of them fell and hurt themselves (not badly, but he<br/>\nmade a huge deal of it at the time so Jim thought he was hurt bad.)<br/>\nJim&#39;s first reaction was to yell and unfortunately state the opposite of<br/>\nhow he actually felt, saying that he can&#39;t feel sympathy for someone who<br/>\nwas &quot;asking for it,&quot; though he did apologize for yelling and explained<br/>\nthat he was only asking them to stop jumping because he was afraid<br/>\nsomeone would get hurt (he is often more afraid of this than I am and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like a lot of the things I let them do, which maybe he&#39;s right,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know?)<br/>\n<br/>\nANYWAY, I kind of got mad because he yelled, and I yelled at him (I<br/>\nknow, not helping) and was trying to explain what he should have done,<br/>\nand he stated, &quot;Well, since we aren&#39;t making the kids listen to us<br/>\nanymore...&quot; , and I tried to quickly think of what he should have maybe<br/>\ndone, so I said, &quot;Well, then get them involved in another activity to<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t jumping anymore, &quot; and he responded that his work was<br/>\nimportant and he didn&#39;t have time to get them involved in something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as I thought about that, I eventually told him that there were at<br/>\nleast three choices he could have made: Let them jump, ignoring them,<br/>\nand watch someone possibly get hurt and end up in the emergency room,<br/>\n(his fear) which takes up LOTS of time, or yell at them to stop and MAKE<br/>\nthem, thus ignoring the style of parenting I&#39;m trying to incorporate, or<br/>\ntake the 5 minutes to pique their interest in something else and go back<br/>\nto finishing up your work, which I understand is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this may not have been the best response, but it&#39;s what I came up<br/>\nwith, and why I&#39;m writing. I told him I make mistakes a lot, too, and I<br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t know how to handle things like that, either. I know we<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to let our kids run &quot;wild&quot; in unshcooling (I think that&#39;s<br/>\nwhere the unparenting comes up, is those of us new to the lifestyle of<br/>\nunschooling who lift all the barriers but have nothing in place to help<br/>\nwhen things get out of control.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve seen Sandra use the term &quot;and mean it&quot; a couple of times,<br/>\nand I read in an old post how she said to look the person in the eye,<br/>\nand in that case remove an object the person was using for harm. But<br/>\nwhat if the person is yelling mean things (like the kid in the car who<br/>\nwas backseat driving - what would you have done if they DIDN&#39;T stop?)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost times I find ways around it by distracting them, etc. But maybe<br/>\nthere&#39;s other things I can do but haven&#39;t thought of. I know other<br/>\nparents are suprised (it may seem silly to those for whom unschooing<br/>\ncomes naturally) when they see that you don&#39;t allow all behaviors of<br/>\nyour children, because that is how I felt. I mistakenly thought that<br/>\ngiving your child freedom to choose meant letting them do and have<br/>\nwhatever they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s the guideing and shaping them, without putting unnecessary<br/>\nlimits on them. And I want to know how to put those necessary limits on<br/>\nthem in gentle ways...Just like my babies. After playing outside for an<br/>\nhour, they always migrate towards the road or parking lot, and I end up<br/>\npicking them up and placing them back in our yard, only to repeat with<br/>\nthe other one (twins.) After half a dozen times I simply take them<br/>\nindoors because they are focused only on that forbidden place, and then<br/>\nthey cry when I stop them. I feel bad that they cry, but the playing in<br/>\nthe road is NOT an option. I have to hope that their crying is okay (and<br/>\ntemperary, of course, as I involve them in something fun inside) as my<br/>\npriority is safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also felt bad last night when we went to the zoo for a halloween<br/>\nnight. It&#39;s an hour away, and the babies don&#39;t do well with long drives.<br/>\nSo they fussed some of the way up there, fussed some of the time there<br/>\n(and were held most of it since they fussed in the stroller) and fussed<br/>\nmost of the way home, with my persistant one crying on and off the whole<br/>\nway. They also do this the few times we&#39;ve been to my parents&#39; home 3<br/>\nhours away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate letting them cry, and used to nurse my other two on long trips.<br/>\nBut I can&#39;t get between their seat and could only nurse one at a time,<br/>\nanyway (I tried when they were younger, and whoever wasn&#39;t nursing cried<br/>\nand made the other one anxious as well. We didn&#39;t make the trip again<br/>\nfor quite awhile.) Bottles and pacifiers never worked for my kids, and<br/>\ntoys and movies only go so far. They know what they want, and it&#39;s out<br/>\nof the car seats. But for the rest of the family, our priority is to<br/>\nenjoy something for the older kids (zoo, or Grandma&#39;s house) We don&#39;t do<br/>\nit often because it&#39;s hard on the babies. But even so, I wonder if I&#39;m<br/>\nwrong in doing it at all, then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI envy people who on another post talked about bringing their babies<br/>\nwith them everywhere. My babies have always slept okay anywhwere we go,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s the getting there that&#39;s difficult. Plus with the twins,<br/>\nthere&#39;s no free arm for me when they both need me and won&#39;t even go to<br/>\nJim. I am often holding one on each hip and rarely do they open up to<br/>\nother people. So it&#39;s hard for me to figure out how to balance the<br/>\nneeds/desires of my older two with the needs/desires of my younger two.<br/>\nSometimes the older ones suffer because of the younger ones (playgrounds<br/>\nare out unless I have another older person to help chase a baby who<br/>\nloves climbing - I can only help one up a ladder.) And sometimes the<br/>\nyounger ones suffer for sake of the older ones (zoo) Is there a way to<br/>\nmake everyone happy? Short of time, that is :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long...these thoughts have been in my head awhile, and<br/>\nafter the short fuse incident tonight, I thought I&#39;d ask.
