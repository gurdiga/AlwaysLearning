There&#39;s lots of learning that&#39;s not about the &quot;facts&quot; <br/>\n  that someone may be saying. I&#39;d say it&#39;s an essential part of <br/>\n  becoming a critical thinker to be exposed to all kinds of information <br/>\n  from all kinds of sources. When you&#39;re not there to filter things for <br/>\n  your kids, how will they have learned how to do it for themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Have you ever noticed that video games make good little soldiers<br/>\n  &gt; who are desensitized to destroying life?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have you ever noticed the many, many kids who play video games and <br/>\n  are clearly not characterized by the above? My son would be one of <br/>\n  them. If you don&#39;t know kids like that, I&#39;m sorry for you. Perhaps <br/>\n  you need to spend more time reading about and/or being with actual <br/>\n  unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; There is absolutely nothing on TV that is accurate<br/>\n  &gt; or valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you don&#39;t realize that you are insulting the many people on <br/>\n  this list who have found lots of valuable things on television. Aside <br/>\n  from the &quot;accuracy&quot; debate, what about just pure fun? What about <br/>\n  entertainment? Since you don&#39;t have a tv, I don&#39;t think you can <br/>\n  accurately describe what&#39;s on right now as worthless. I could make a <br/>\n  compelling argument that we are currently in a golden age of <br/>\n  television. Sure there&#39;s lots of crap, but there&#39;s lots of crappy <br/>\n  books and music and art, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your description of the results of television on people is untrue. <br/>\n  Real people can be more complex and more intelligent than you seem to <br/>\n  give us credit for.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Paula, whose life has been vastly enriched by television and who <br/>\n  still manages to be a non-racist, feminist lover of the environment <br/>\n  who votes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28511,"nextTopicId":28609}}
