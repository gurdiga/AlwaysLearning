I&#39;ve just read it again, and the peace and energy popped back out <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I read all ( the late) John Holt books, some before <br/>\nthe boys were born.  I read all Growing Without Schooling ( from # 1 to <br/>\nthe end), I read all( the late) Donn Reed&#39;s books, and lots more. .&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need us, but we could sure use you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have time and mood one of these days and would be willing to write <br/>\nsomething for the typical days page, that would be wonderful.  &quot;What&#39;s a typical <br/>\nunschooling day&quot; is one of the most-asked questions, and the only book out <br/>\nthere with typical days (A Patchwork of Days) is *very* light on <br/>\nunschooling/liberal/non-structured families.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve collected so far:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical&quot;\">http://sandradodd.com/typical&quot;</a>&gt;Typical Unschooling Days&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; But there are also these moments, I would like to trap in time:  Like <br/>\nwhen the three of them played guitar in a concert last month ( they only <br/>\nstarted to play last November );  or seeing them acting plays they  <br/>\nauthored; Or seeing the twins and one of their friend putting a whole <br/>\nservice for the fellowship  ( Philip was the service leader !  );  Or <br/>\nlistening to  Lewis discussing computer system configurations with one <br/>\nof our specialist friend...( and our friend was awed by his knowledge, <br/>\nwhich was way over my head )&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could trap some moments for others, in part, maybe.<br/>\nThat was great to read, your whole bio post.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the very delayed reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15030,"nextTopicId":12626}}
