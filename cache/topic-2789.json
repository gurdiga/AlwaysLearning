But, on the other hand, there&#39;s no particular reason to believe that. <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m comfortable with holding those seemingly opposing thoughts in my head <br/>\nat one time &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe model of this lifetime that works for me is that we&#39;re here to develop <br/>\nsomething - probably sensitivities of various kinds - to improve our <br/>\ncharacter in some way. And it makes sense to me that there&#39;s a reason for <br/>\nthat and it is either to help civilization progress even though we won&#39;t be <br/>\npart of it after we&#39;re dead - or because we will still be part of it in some <br/>\nway that we can&#39;t at all foresee. It seems obvious to me that we&#39;re built to <br/>\n&quot;learn&quot; and to try to improve ourselves and so the purpose of life, if there <br/>\nis one, has something to do with that. Now - there may be no purpose to life <br/>\nand that&#39;s okay - like Sandra said it doesn&#39;t really matter. I still have <br/>\nfamily and friends and I still have things to do and I still try constantly <br/>\nto figure out how to live a life that seems &quot;good&quot; to me. My behavior won&#39;t <br/>\nbe any different one way or the other. And I&#39;m WAY too much of a scientist to <br/>\njust &quot;accept&quot; on faith that there is an afterlife where some sort of soul <br/>\nlives on. So I think of it as a &quot;model&quot; and it works as a way to live because <br/>\nANY choice of what to believe is just that - a chosen model. This one makes <br/>\nsense to me. It isn&#39;t &quot;science&quot; since it can&#39;t be proved wrong - at least not <br/>\nin this lifetime. But I guess it IS science &lt;G&gt; but only within the <br/>\nconstructs of the model that includes the existence of an afterlife since <br/>\nthat&#39;ll be the time when the assumption of a soul will be tested empirically. <br/>\nWait - I&#39;m going in circles again -- doesn&#39;t that just ALWAYS seem to happen <br/>\nwhen we think about these kinds of things? &lt;BEG&gt; Still, it is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2179,"nextTopicId":2622}}
