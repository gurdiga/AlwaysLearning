It was probably<br/>\n&gt; on the HSC list, but it may have been at a northern California HSC<br/>\n&gt; get-together we went to. Nope (checking archives for June 11 and 12 of<br/>\n&gt; 2001),  it was on the list, and all of the official HCS people who posted<br/>\n&gt; agreed that each child needed to have a responsible adult with them at<br/>\n&gt; each workshop they attended.  In support of this, an example was given of<br/>\n&gt; two children who were dropped off and not picked up at the end of a<br/>\n&gt; workshop. It was suggested that people (even people posting who had<br/>\n&gt; responsible 9 and 11 year old kids) bring  a designated sitter to<br/>\n&gt; accompany he kids to workshops. No one said anything about your<br/>\n&gt; individual child being responsible enough to do anything independently,<br/>\n&gt; unless they had hit the magic age of 13. So if things have changed,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s wonderful, but the message last year was different.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote that example on the HSC list. It was part of an explanation of why we <br/>\nNO LONGER have parent drop-offs - with parents signing kids in and out. The <br/>\nreason is that then the workshop presenters, who want to go on to see the <br/>\nrest of the conference and who have kids of their own to take care of, end up <br/>\nsitting with other people&#39;s kids when the other people forget to come get <br/>\nthem from a workshop. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do that anymore. Parents are responsible for their own kids. This is <br/>\nthe same message I gave last year when I was responsible for the conference. <br/>\nNo changes. The rules say: &quot;Children must be accompanied by a responsible <br/>\nadult at all times.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice this means that YOU, the parent, are responsible for your child. <br/>\nYou cannot dump them at a workshop and leave and expect the workshop <br/>\npresenter to babysit them until you decide to come back and get them. If they <br/>\nneed to go to the bathroom during a workshop, they&#39;ll just leave, and if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t come back, nobody is going to notice. If your child is disruptive or <br/>\ndestructive during the workshop, there will be nobody there to give <br/>\nindividual attention to your child and we&#39;ll ask you to be in the room with <br/>\nhim/her from then on. This applies to children of any age. If you have full <br/>\nconfidence that your child is okay to leave a workshop whenever, to not be <br/>\ndisruptive while there, to handle it if stung by a bee and there is no adult <br/>\nto treat them, to go to the bathroom or get a drink without an adult keeping <br/>\ntrack of them, to find their way around the hotel, to not be upset if they <br/>\nhave trouble finding you, to ask for help if needed, to stay out of the way <br/>\nof automobiles, to stay out of the fountains and the lake, etc., then you <br/>\nbeing on the premises might be enough. If conference staff has to come <br/>\nlooking for you because your child has a problem, then you&#39;ll be reminded <br/>\nthat children are supposed to be accompanied by a responsible adult. It is <br/>\nnot &quot;responsible&quot; if the child can&#39;t find you when they need you. I always <br/>\nmade sure my child was going to a workshop with a buddy - and that they were <br/>\nclear that they were expected to stay together. I have their schedule and I <br/>\ncheck on them regularly. Not a problem. When they were little, either myself <br/>\nor another adult would take charge of a group of kids - taking turns watching <br/>\nover them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish we could assume all parents & kids would act responsibly, and not need <br/>\nto have this requirement as a backup, but they don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: sacramento","postDate":"1015550227","msgId":5382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjLjIzYmFhMDI3LjI5Yjk2YjEzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5381,"nextInTopic":5470,"prevInTime":5381,"nextInTime":5383,"topicId":5381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/7/2002 1:56:46 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...
