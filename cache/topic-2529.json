Their ONLY choice to <br/>\nmake that better is for the new female to spend lots of one-on-one time with <br/>\nher, and for her to accept without resentment lots of one-on-one time with <br/>\nher dad.  Otherwise, the situation will always be that a stranger took her <br/>\ndad away.  There&#39;s no other position for the child if the parents bond <br/>\ntogether and say &quot;We are a unit you will have to deal with.&quot;  Especially for <br/>\na little kid.  But even for a seventeen year old, and I speak from <br/>\nexperience.  My fourteen year old sister was put under the totally-foreign <br/>\nauthority of someone who wanted her to wear pink pantsuits (she didn&#39;t) and <br/>\ntie her frizzy hair back before coming into the house (she did, so she could <br/>\neat and sleep and see her own father).  I was already at college, so the <br/>\naffect on me was that I had no good place to go on the weekends or holidays <br/>\nanymore.  My mom was usually at the bar, and my dad was working and the <br/>\nstepmother (who had effected the sale of the house I was supposed to have <br/>\ninherited without it even being discussed with me) was there, knowing little <br/>\nto nothing about me and caring less. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child WANTS time with the newer family member that&#39;s an incredible <br/>\nopportunity that shouldn&#39;t be passed up.  She&#39;s not trying to separate the <br/>\ncouple as much as be recognized as a whole member of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I was told that the grandaughter of a good (former teacher) friend <br/>\nof mine asked her stepdad to adopt her.  She&#39;s in her early 20&#39;s.  He offered <br/>\nbefore, but she said no, hoping against hope that her dad would perk up and <br/>\npay attention to her.  And she DID have a dad, and she DID have his name, but <br/>\nin retrospect, on a trip out of the country, she realized that the stepdad <br/>\nwas pretty great to her, and the real dad was not.  So she&#39;s changing her <br/>\nname, as an adult, to her stepdad&#39;s name.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether any of that ore is helpful, I don&#39;t know, but maybe you found a <br/>\nnugget of something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2330,"nextTopicId":2530}}
