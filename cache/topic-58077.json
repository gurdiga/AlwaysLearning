Her salary has been tripled and she wants to contribute money every month to our daughter&#39;s college fund.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t actually have a college savings account for our daughter.  I have an account for her, in her name, where I&#39;ve managed to put a small bit away, but that&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: how do unschoolers save for their children&#39;s future?  I don&#39;t want to assume that my 7 year old will or will not want to go to college when she&#39;s older and I know traditional 529 accounts are heavily penalized when the money is used for anything other than &quot;education.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my MIL will be open to a conversation about &quot;seed money&quot; in general, rather than &quot;college&quot; money in particular.  She sees how wonderful unschooling is for our family, and I think she&#39;ll appreciate that N *may* choose a non-traditional educational path, like starting a business, or sailing around the world, whatever.  She may choose to go to university, too, but I don&#39;t want that to be predetermined by our planning, or lack thereof.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny experience, thoughts, suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57967,"nextTopicId":58058}}
