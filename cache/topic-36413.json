We have had other people come in to clean, which was a nuisance because I still had to pick up for them. We had a woman and her two children, victims of domestic violence, live with us for almost 2 years (she was going to stay for one night and it went on from there) and she was a compulsive cleaner. That was great! We loved having cute little girls and a mother who cleaned. I was spoiled by that but we all got used to things being cleaner. When I stopped working for pay, I didn&#39;t want to pay someone to clean. I knew that it was my choice, but I still resented it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Loving What Is&quot; by Byron Katie helped me to change my thinking. Now I clean when I feel like cleaning and don&#39;t when I don&#39;t. But I never resent it anymore. When I want things cleaned up, I do it. If it is before we have people over, then usually everyone will pitch in to help. Or not, if they don&#39;t feel like it. There are cleaning supplies in the boy&#39;s bathroom and I have vinyl flooring all around the toilet area. Guests are welcome to clean up after after middle-of-the-night-boy-aim or I can always pop in to quick clean up. If people don&#39;t like my house keeping they are welcome to not visit. My mother hasn&#39;t been to our house in almost 5 years. We meet at my brother&#39;s house and it is lovely. (My parents live across the country and my brother lives in the next town and has a house cleaner.) It is such a wonderful feeling to be free of the house-pride and anxiety that entailed. And to be free of the resentment about the housecleaning. I also now love noticing how much exercise I get from vacuuming and carrying laundry up and down the stairs. Putting dirty socks away is a great little calorie burning break. It took a while after doing The Work (from the book) but I am really peaceful about the cleaning. I still have plenty of other things to work on, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJae <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197421595,"authorName":"Katy","from":"&quot;Katy&quot; &lt;kjennings95@...&gt;","profile":"coyotegoddess95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cleaning - Was:  &quot;What was I thinking&quot; was Telling our kids the answers v...","postDate":"1215824827","msgId":36517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNy1EQVY3NTUwNTI1REREMkVFREM1REE1MDhCRTkyMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQzNS4yZWQ2OTMzMy4zNWE4ZjVjY0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8NTI4QkIwMUUtRDVEMi00QUIzLTkxNzgtN0I3OEI1QkNDMkYwQG1hYy5jb20+IDwxMjE1ODAwNDU4LjE4Mjg2LjEyNjMwNTE3MTVAd2VibWFpbC5tZXNzYWdpbmdlbmdpbmUuY29tPiA8NjUzNEVBNkItQzlCMC00RUM5LTg0NzktMEQ3MTM4RjVDN0MyQG1hYy5jb20+IDwwMDhEMEExQy0yOEZBLTQ5ODctQkRCQy1FMTNCQTc2ODFEODhAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36479,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":36516,"nextInTime":36518,"topicId":36413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2003810979\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I wash his dirty socks and underwear, I think that someday I might miss the smell of him, and the simple little things like folding his t-shirts.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy step-dad died in February, he hadn&#39;t really been sick (that we knew of!).

It takes me about 2 minutes to clear up some  <br/>\ndishes and stuff that they&#39;ve usually left around - but while I&#39;m  <br/>\ndoing that, I pay attention to what dvd&#39;s are out or what other clues  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve left. Once in a while I&#39;ll go to put something, very quietly,  <br/>\ninto one of their rooms and the other one will be in there, too,  <br/>\nasleep. I LOVE knowing that they were hanging out together and fell  <br/>\nasleep watching tv or listening to music or talking to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery once in a while my husband will say, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be cleaning  <br/>\nup after them. Leave it for them to clean up when they get up.&quot; That  <br/>\nwould have made sense to me, years ago, but now it seems silly. I can  <br/>\nclean it up in less than 2 minutes and spend my morning in a clutter- <br/>\nfree room, which is pleasant for me. And, like I said, I have FUN  <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m straightening up after them - I&#39;m enjoying that minute or  <br/>\ntwo of thinking about them and what they were doing/making/eating/ <br/>\ndrinking, etc., the night before.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;What was I thinking&quot; was Telling our kids the answers v...","postDate":"1215798220","msgId":36413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzNS4yZWQ2OTMzMy4zNWE4ZjVjY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36416,"prevInTime":36412,"nextInTime":36414,"topicId":36413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/11/2008 4:34:22 AM Eastern Daylight Time, s.waynforth@btopenworld.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-335565868\">In a message dated 7/11/2008 4:34:22 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;As I peer closer I can see a bird she made and drawings  she&#39;s drawn and <br/>\nplanes she designed as toys for the kittens.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is so cool-it made me smile and think of the Lion King movie, at the  <br/>\nend where Rafikki is trying to get Simba to look within himself by way of a  <br/>\nreflection in the water and he says, &quot;Look *ha*rder&quot; as he points him to look at  <br/>\nthe reflection again.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s what the trick is-instead of me looking superficially at the  <br/>\n&quot;mess&quot;, I need to &quot;look harder&quot;, look deeper and see what my kids see.
