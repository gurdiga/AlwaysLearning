I have heard over and over and over from people whose kids <br/>\nwere having serious problems at school and parents considered <br/>\nhomeschooling, but the only homeschoolers they came across identified <br/>\nhomeschooling as something for Christians. That kept people from <br/>\npursuing homeschooling, sometimes for years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ===&gt;  In case you think that&#39;s not likely, I&#39;ve already had people tell me that<br/>\n&gt; they would not unschool because it is associated with a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; new-agey stuff.&quot;&lt;===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s likely. I don&#39;t dispute you on that at all. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen that before. I am sure some of those people just were not open to unschooling at all and maybe that was just an excuse used to avoid discussing it further?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will say that although I call myself new to unschooling. I first joined an unschooling over four years ago. I have been a reading member of this list since the summer of 2008? I have only in the last year and a half embrassed the term unschooling for our family...however well before that I would say we are &quot;unschooly.&quot; We have been living without curriculum for over three years now and my kids are 15, 13&  12.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the biggest turn-offs for new unschoolers that*I*  have seen (you have way more experience with this but I do actually meet a lot of almost unschoolers or interested in unschooling through my activism here in NH)...anyway....the biggest turn-off I&#39;ve seen and heard is about*unschooling dogma*  or about judgments from other unschooling parents.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Different discussion. Unless you think that one turn-off justifies <br/>\nanother. Two wrongs make a right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ===&gt;I think the point may have been misunderstood. I doubt anybody here<br/>\n&gt; objects to people choosing to believe in anything they choose to believe<br/>\n&gt; in, including the law of attraction, libertarianism, or anything else.&lt;===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only thing I have to say here is...libertarian thought/philosophy (again I&#39;m not talking about the Libertarian political party either) is just that it is*not*  religion or a*belief system*  it&#39;s a philosophy. It&#39;s not based on anything spiritual or supernatural or whatever. It&#39;s a philosophical perspective on governing people. Much like unschooling is a philosophical perspective on parenting.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Huh? Libertarians believe in certain things. So do unschoolers. I was <br/>\nnot equating &quot;belief&quot; with anything supernatural or religious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ===&gt;I think it is unethical for people to go around identifying unschooling<br/>\n&gt; with the law of attraction or with libertarianism or Christianity or any<br/>\n&gt; other particular belief system.00&lt;===<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unethical? Really...why? I am totally bewildered.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t honest. Honest would be to say, &quot;I&#39;m talking about combining <br/>\nunschooling with this other belief system,&quot; and honest would be to take <br/>\ncare that I was clear about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And to stay on topic how does that make you a better unschooling parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How does what make who a better unschooling parent? Being more honest <br/>\nrather than less?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is grouping it with mindfulness (and yes, I read the explanation on page 199 of Sandra&#39;s book), Attachment Parenting or La Leche League...unethical?<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If someone claimed to be talking about unschooling, but instead talked <br/>\nabout attachment parenting, then yes. Most people involved in attachment <br/>\nparenting don&#39;t even homeschool, much less unschool. If they claimed <br/>\nunschooling was the same as breastfeeding? Huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I truly do not understand. I&#39;m open to hearing though...and I hope that I have not come of angry, upset or otherwise...I am enjoying the discussion (although, I&#39;m very concerned about being unintentionally hurtful - email can be a challenging medium in that way).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have my own personal political and religious beliefs. I have shared <br/>\nalmost none of that on any unschooling lists. It isn&#39;t relevant to those <br/>\nwho don&#39;t share them with me and I&#39;m not here to persuade or argue <br/>\nreligion or politics.  If I wanted to talk with other unschoolers about <br/>\nhow unschooling relates to my own particular religious or political <br/>\nbeliefs, I&#39;d make it clear that that is what we were talking about and <br/>\nthey could choose to participate or not.  I don&#39;t NEED people to share <br/>\nmy political or religious beliefs in order to talk with them about <br/>\nunschooling, though.

We do *not* do/invoke/whatever the Law of Attraction component. We do have friends that do, good friends. And they remain our friends and support us even though that piece is not a part of our life. <br/>\n<br/>\n===&gt;The problem is that people come across <br/>\nradical-unschooling-law-of-attraction-style and think that is what <br/>\nradical unschooling is. &lt;===<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are people who are only looking at the surface. There are also people, I&#39;m sure who come to unschooling *because* of the Law of Attraction component. It could be a gateway. I don&#39;t personally understand the connection (at all) but other people do. If it leads them to a more peaceful loving life with their children. That&#39;s great, from my perspective. What if one of your *kids* (I realize they are grown now) had a sudden interest in Law of Attraction? Would you honor that interest? <br/>\n<br/>\n===&gt;If they aren&#39;t interested in accepting the Law <br/>\nof Attraction belief system, they can be turned off of unschooling.&lt;===<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s unfortunate but I would argue their interest wasn&#39;t that strong to begin with. And probably not open enough to *get* unschooling (at least the whole life unschooling) if they already have such a strong negative attachment to it. <br/>\n<br/>\n===&gt; In case you think that&#39;s not likely, I&#39;ve already had people tell me that <br/>\nthey would not unschool because it is associated with a bunch of <br/>\nnew-agey stuff.&quot;&lt;===<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s likely. I don&#39;t dispute you on that at all. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen that before. I am sure some of those people just were not open to unschooling at all and maybe that was just an excuse used to avoid discussing it further? <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that although I call myself new to unschooling. I first joined an unschooling over four years ago. I have been a reading member of this list since the summer of 2008? I have only in the last year and a half embrassed the term unschooling for our family...however well before that I would say we are &quot;unschooly.&quot; We have been living without curriculum for over three years now and my kids are 15, 13 & 12. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest turn-offs for new unschoolers that *I* have seen (you have way more experience with this but I do actually meet a lot of almost unschoolers or interested in unschooling through my activism here in NH)...anyway....the biggest turn-off I&#39;ve seen and heard is about *unschooling dogma* or about judgments from other unschooling parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n===&gt;I think the point may have been misunderstood. I doubt anybody here<br/>\nobjects to people choosing to believe in anything they choose to believe<br/>\nin, including the law of attraction, libertarianism, or anything else.&lt;===<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I have to say here is...libertarian thought/philosophy (again I&#39;m not talking about the Libertarian political party either) is just that it is *not* religion or a *belief system* it&#39;s a philosophy. It&#39;s not based on anything spiritual or supernatural or whatever. It&#39;s a philosophical perspective on governing people. Much like unschooling is a philosophical perspective on parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n===&gt;I think it is unethical for people to go around identifying unschooling<br/>\nwith the law of attraction or with libertarianism or Christianity or any<br/>\nother particular belief system.00&lt;===<br/>\n<br/>\nUnethical? Really...why? I am totally bewildered. And to stay on topic how does that make you a better unschooling parent? Is grouping it with mindfulness (and yes, I read the explanation on page 199 of Sandra&#39;s book), Attachment Parenting or La Leche League...unethical? <br/>\n<br/>\nI truly do not understand. I&#39;m open to hearing though...and I hope that I have not come of angry, upset or otherwise...I am enjoying the discussion (although, I&#39;m very concerned about being unintentionally hurtful - email can be a challenging medium in that way).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to understand, <br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Attraction -- was Influences - Libertarian","postDate":"1273563828","msgId":54047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRTkwQUI0LjcwNzA4MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyRTNBREI0MkVBMjQ3M0Q4QjAwMjQyNzQ2OTM2MEI1QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","referencesHeader":"PDEyRTNBREI0MkVBMjQ3M0Q4QjAwMjQyNzQ2OTM2MEI1QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4="},"prevInTopic":54027,"nextInTopic":54068,"prevInTime":54046,"nextInTime":54048,"topicId":54027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
