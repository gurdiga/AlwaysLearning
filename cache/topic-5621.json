These were put together<br/>\nby the place that&#39;s doing the field trip.  I&#39;m sure they thought they were<br/>\ndoing us a favor and being very helpful... I just looked at them and thought<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t think we need to be testing them on what plants they saw and what<br/>\ncolors they are&quot;... It will be interesting to see whether anyone whips that<br/>\nout while on this trip as we are not just unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother incident today occurred when I was taking Zak to the Theatre (they<br/>\nhave a matinee series for schools).  We go as a homeschooling group....<br/>\nSomeone asked Zak if he was homeschooled and he said &quot;yes&quot; they then asked<br/>\nwhat grade he said &quot;no grade I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;... &quot;Oh&quot; she said &quot;you don&#39;t<br/>\ndo grades, how sweet&quot; (in a condenscending manner).... I smiled and said<br/>\nNOTHING...what an accomplishment for me....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were tons of kids there all in a row, being told to stand still, be<br/>\nquiet, stop talking, stay in line (this is outside the theatre)... Lots of<br/>\nuniforms and 2 grown ups to about 20 kids, which I&#39;m told is good (whatever<br/>\nthat means)...<br/>\n<br/>\nZak enjoyed Ballet Hispanico for a while and then asked when the acrobats<br/>\nwere coming on (a recent theatre trip).. when I told him that this was a<br/>\ndifferent show he said he&#39;d stay but would prefer the acrobats.  I gave him<br/>\nthe option of leaving, but he didn&#39;t want to... I thought about how those<br/>\nother kids don&#39;t have that choice if they don&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium on Friday and there were a few<br/>\n<br/>\nschool groups there. I noticed that one of the groups had handed<br/>\n<br/>\nout notebooks with questions that their students needed to answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought how sad that those children couldn&#39;t just relax and enjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nthe place. My children learn so much every time we visit - they<br/>\n<br/>\nhad to show Rob all their favorite places - he&#39;s been working too<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch lately and hasn&#39;t been able to go with us. Rob and I were<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch more relaxed when all the school groups left. I don&#39;t think<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan and Alex even noticed them - the aquarium is much too interesting<br/>\n<br/>\nfor them!<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5624,"nextTopicId":5630}}
