The least expensive one is about $30-$40 and would be a good starting place. If you sign up on their website, you&#39;ll get discount offers. There is a 30-day free trial that&#39;s basically the full program. There&#39;s an iPad app too, which is fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter received the more expensive program as a gift, but prefers Flash. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to navigate it alone, though, and she has a few years of experience with drawing software under her belt already. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she use a mouse or a stylus? While getting used to using a stylus is challenging, that might be something to look into as well. Once she gets used to it, she&#39;ll probably find it indispensable. My daughter actually games with hers too <br/>\n<br/>\nHave her check out MAPs and MEPs on YouTube. They&#39;re Multi Animator or Editor Projects where a group of artists get together and each person animates a few seconds of a clip, kind of like an animated music video . It&#39;s a great way to work without getting burned out. If she likes Warrior Cats, there are a ton of Warrior MAP videos and people are always posting openings for new ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56456279,"authorName":"Michelle","from":"&quot;Michelle&quot; &lt;helbywasher@...&gt;","profile":"michellerabbidge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Question about animation","postDate":"1375010740","msgId":71772,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0MnYzayt0NDY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtzdmM2Yys0cjYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71771,"nextInTopic":71776,"prevInTime":71771,"nextInTime":71773,"topicId":71765,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son has really enjoyed using a free program called Minemator to make minecraft animations.
