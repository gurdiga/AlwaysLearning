Just as children deserve respect when they don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand and are asking for advice. I&#39;m not asking for anyone to spend<br/>\nvolunteer time to keep me comfortable.

If you continue  <br/>\ntalking calmly when he&#39;s gotten to the point that he&#39;s emotional, how  <br/>\ndoes that help?  Maybe not talking at all would be better.  Just  <br/>\ncalmly disengage, maybe.  When you feel like talking again, when  <br/>\nyou&#39;re not in public, when you&#39;ve calmed down, ask him if he can  <br/>\nrephrase more calmly.  (That&#39;s one of many ideas; not &quot;the right  <br/>\nanswer.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n** I can see how asking him to rephrase more calmly would work in certain<br/>\nsituations. In the case of remaining calm while he&#39;s angry, I was hoping<br/>\nthat by not getting emotional, I wouldn&#39;t be feeding his anger, that he<br/>\nwould see I was still talking to him and trying to understand what was going<br/>\non, even though he was upset, and sometimes that really does work, he gets<br/>\ncalmed down and talks to me. Obviously it doesn&#39;t work every time. Not<br/>\ntalking to him seems like ignoring him--do you mean something else? <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that disengaging is always possible, in public, because I need<br/>\nto know if he&#39;s coming inside a store with me or staying in the car, etc. If<br/>\nI&#39;ve locked the doors because I think he&#39;s joining us, but he wants to get<br/>\nin the car instead and yells at me, but I&#39;m already in the store, that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help. In this particular instance, which happened on Thursday and<br/>\nprompted me to write in the first place, he had misunderstood where we were<br/>\ngoing, because he wasn&#39;t listening to me while I was talking to my daughter<br/>\nabout how to get to the store. We were stopping at a thrift shop she wanted<br/>\nto go to before it closed. My son got out of the car and started crossing<br/>\nthe street to go where he thought we were going. I told him where we were<br/>\nactually going, tried to explain why I thought he&#39;d gotten confused, and he<br/>\nstarted yelling that that&#39;s not what I had said earlier. Then, as we were<br/>\nwalking to the store, he was really angry and calling me names, etc. He<br/>\nstarted walking back to the car. I hadn&#39;t really responded to his yelling,<br/>\nother than to explain what we were doing, but did ask if he was going to<br/>\nwait in the car or if he wanted to come in with us, and he kept up the<br/>\nyelling. Then he came inside. While we&#39;re inside he&#39;s still angry, then sees<br/>\na large buck knife in a display case and asks if he can buy it. All of a<br/>\nsudden he&#39;s not mad at me. I completely understand how this change can<br/>\nhappen. I was the same when I was younger--sudden mood change from angry to<br/>\nhappy, etc. So that&#39;s not an issue. But I don&#39;t know what I could have done<br/>\nduring all this instead. I am open to suggestions. I know something similar<br/>\nwill happen again and would like to be prepared.  **<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- guess I was hoping that giving him his freedom would  <br/>\nautomatically take care of all the past injustices he’s felt.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you apologized to him?<br/>\nHave you explained (briefly, occasionally) why you&#39;ve changed?<br/>\nA little explanation is better than too much.<br/>\nA little apology is better than too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n** I&#39;ve apologized for not starting on the RU path sooner, told him I wish<br/>\nwe&#39;d known about this sooner, and have tried to explain why we&#39;re changing,<br/>\nbut he&#39;s really not interested in listening to me when he thinks I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto talk &quot;seriously&quot; to him.

Well, I don’t want him treating me<br/>\nwell because he’s afraid of getting in trouble!<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might ask your husband if he was treating your son the way he  <br/>\nwants your son to treat him and you.  Kids learn better by example  <br/>\nthan by lecture.  It will take a while for him to trust that you&#39;ve  <br/>\nchanged, if you can and do change.  You&#39;re not there yet, and it will  <br/>\ntake a while.  Then it will take another while for him to relax and  <br/>\ntrust the new situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n** I have, and DH was saying back in September that he was totally on board<br/>\nwith RU, after the conference, but he&#39;s not with the kids as much as I am<br/>\nand doesn&#39;t need to be thinking about how to be different as much as I do,<br/>\nbecause his time is limited with them. So he listens to what I say about no<br/>\nchores, no rules, etc, but he still wants them to clean up after themselves.<br/>\nI told him that he doesn&#39;t see the things I see during the day, that keep me<br/>\nthinking this can work. He just sees a few hours in the evenings and the<br/>\nweekends. He doesn&#39;t observe their behavior like I do. I&#39;m trying to explain<br/>\nthat this will work if we keep at it, but I&#39;m also still not getting it<br/>\ncompletely, so I have a hard time answering his questions on what to expect<br/>\nfrom the kids, how they&#39;ll change, how this whole thing will work out in the<br/>\nend. And when I&#39;m frustrated and tell him about my big blow-up, he sees it<br/>\nas a reason not to be on this path.

I�m feeling like such a failure right now with<br/>\nmy 8 yo son. We were at L&L this year, and decided then that DH and I wanted<br/>\nto truly become radical unschoolers, but of course, we�re fighting our own<br/>\nupbringings and the last 18 yrs of parenting (he has an 18 yo from a<br/>\nprevious marriage). I don�t feel that I�m failing my daughter (11) so<br/>\nmuch�I�ve recognized that what she displays as anger (or what I perceive to<br/>\nbe anger) is actually just, as she put it, feeling annoyed, not angry.<br/>\nThere�s a big difference to her. And I�m really sensitive to others� moods,<br/>\nso I get defensive, feeling it�s all my fault, whatever it is. And that the<br/>\nanger or annoyance or frustration is directed at and caused by me. But I�m<br/>\nreminding myself that�s not the case usually, and so I try to get a clearer<br/>\nunderstanding from her of what is going on before jumping to conclusions. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, with my son, I can�t have the same level of conversation. He<br/>\ndoesn�t want to talk about any of it. He sometimes treats me<br/>\ndisrespectfully/rudely at home and out in public, and that is such a trigger<br/>\nfor me. I usually try to continue talking calmly to him and ignore the<br/>\nrudeness and hear the message. But that doesn�t always work, especially if<br/>\nI�m feeling tired or particularly sensitive. Of course, it�s because I feel<br/>\nlike I haven�t treated him well in the past, and so this is his normal<br/>\nreaction, even if I am trying to do better. I guess I was hoping that giving<br/>\nhim his freedom would automatically take care of all the past injustices<br/>\nhe�s felt. And I know that�s not realistic. But I still feel awful and just<br/>\ndon�t know how to understand him and his needs better. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day he was really rude to me and I reacted badly. Then at home, I<br/>\ntold DH what had happened, and how I feel it�s my fault for not doing<br/>\n�something� better, and DH had a talk with him, which wasn�t the kind of<br/>\ntalk I wanted him to have, because he basically told Thomas that it really<br/>\nupset him to see me upset and that if he found that Thomas was treating me<br/>\nrudely again, he�d be in lots of trouble. Well, I don�t want him treating me<br/>\nwell because he�s afraid of getting in trouble!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just not coming naturally to either of us and so I start beating<br/>\nmyself up over it. And the fact that I can�t explain well to DH how we�d be<br/>\nbetter parents if we did things differently. It�s just been since September,<br/>\nbut I want things to be joyful and come naturally right now. I know I have<br/>\nchoices I can make each time, but I feel pulled into my past reactions. I<br/>\nfeel like I�m letting my son down each time I do this, and I just don�t know<br/>\nwhat it is that I can do to help him, what it is he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I�m looking for help, and don�t know what my next step is. I keep<br/>\nthinking, gosh, they have all this freedom now, they should see that helping<br/>\nwith dishes or some chore is a nice thing to do together, and then since I<br/>\ndon�t want to *tell* them to help I end up trying to guilt them into<br/>\nhelping. I recognize that. It doesn�t happen all the time, but it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne recent example of how I messed up�I asked Thomas if he would bring in<br/>\none of his drink glasses from the computer desk to the kitchen, since I was<br/>\ndoing dishes, and he just started yelling at me about how *I* never do<br/>\nanything and I make him do everything, which is the complete opposite almost<br/>\nof how things really are. I recognize that either this is how he truly sees<br/>\nit, or he�s just frustrated about something and this is the first thing that<br/>\ncomes to mind to say. But I ended up yelling at him that I�ve been doing all<br/>\nthe cleaning and just asked if he�d bring in one glass. On the other hand,<br/>\nthe same week he helped put away the silverware while I was doing the rest<br/>\nof the dishes, and all I did was ask if he�d help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI really don�t want to get beat up over this on the list, but I need help<br/>\nfiguring this out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSilvia<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Sandra Dodd<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 08, 2007 5:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: anger and sadness in 5 yo<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-There is no magic button you can push - no magic words you can say.<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve already gotten yourselves into a situation, then you can be<br/>\nsuper sympathetic and resolve the situation as quickly as possible. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPam&#39;s whole post was good, and when I went to look for a place to put <br/>\nit, I found other things that might be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming the Parent You Want to Be<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/peace/becoming.html&quot;http://www.sandradodd.com/pea\">http://www.sandradodd.com/peace/becoming.html&quot;http://www.sandradodd.com/pea</a><br/>\nce/becoming.html<br/>\n<br/>\nMothering During a Meltdown<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn&quot;http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn&quot;http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding Anger<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/anger&quot;http://sandradodd.com/peace/anger\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/anger&quot;http://sandradodd.com/peace/anger</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand Pam&#39;s new writing is now here:<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/soothing&quot;http://sandradodd.com/pam/soothing\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/soothing&quot;http://sandradodd.com/pam/soothing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nParenting Peacefully<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully&quot;http://sandradodd.com/parentingpe\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully&quot;http://sandradodd.com/parentingpe</a><br/>\nacefully<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding an Unschooling Nest<br/>\nHYPERLINK &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest&quot;http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest&quot;http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose all have links to other pages, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.5.503 / Virus Database: 269.15.25/1118 - Release Date: 11/8/2007<br/>\n9:29 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.503 / Virus Database: 269.15.26/1120 - Release Date: 11/9/2007<br/>\n9:26 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"wisdomalways5","from":"&quot;wisdomalways5&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"wisdomalways5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: anger and sadness in 5 yo","postDate":"1194635324","msgId":31387,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoMmI3cyszbHI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2REIyNTQwLTRCQzEtNDQyMS05NTg4LTQ0NTU2OTZDNTBEMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31386,"nextInTopic":31408,"prevInTime":31386,"nextInTime":31388,"topicId":31333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She usually sees  <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m getting at pretty quickly and she knows how to turn her  <br/>\nmoods and cheer herself up pretty well.  And she wants to be happy.   <br/>\nAnd I know some ways to remind her of that without making her  <br/>\nangry.   But this has developed gradually over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use different words every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been around moms who use stock phrases, either their own or  <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s.  They use quotes (some families use Bible verses,  <br/>\nothers might use quotes from songs or dichos (northern New Mexico,  <br/>\nfamilies I grew up with) which are like proverbs or maxims (literally  <br/>\nin English, &quot;sayings&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying NEVER say &quot;A stitch in time saves nine&quot; or whatever,  <br/>\nbut don&#39;t say it more than maybe twice in another person&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a mom uses other people&#39;s words instead of her own, she&#39;s  <br/>\ncreating distance between herself and her child.  It can be seen as a  <br/>\nkind of ganging up, whether it&#39;s quoting religious texts (implying  <br/>\nthe mom and Jesus, Mohammed, Vishnu or the Reverent Moon or somebody  <br/>\nboth/all want the child to stop doing whatever it is), or whether the  <br/>\nmom is ganging up with Benjamin Franklin or Eda LeShan or Adele Farber.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet those people&#39;s advice infuse you, and then try as soon as you can  <br/>\nto speak with your own voice, as you would speak to a friend or  <br/>\nsomeone you just met.  It&#39;s a form of baby-talking a child, in some  <br/>\ncases, for the parents to use quotes and other people&#39;s phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.  If it bothers you  <br/>\nto have people use stock phrases, don&#39;t do it to other people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: anger and sadness in 5 yo","postDate":"1194615930","msgId":31365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGMjU0RTdDLUY5OEYtNEU2OS1BMTE3LTY5MEEwMUE1NDEwQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZoMWMzbytxaTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZoMWMzbytxaTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31363,"nextInTopic":31366,"prevInTime":31364,"nextInTime":31366,"topicId":31333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Up to this point, it seemed you were validating him, then that changed when he tried to express himself in a way you felt attacked and judged it to be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-278939390\">-=-Up to this point, it seemed you were validating him, then that  <br/>\nchanged<br/>\nwhen he tried to express himself in a way you felt attacked and judged<br/>\nit to be inappropriate. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be the &quot;validation&quot; is what pissed him off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We try to exist in a nuturing home environment, one that validates<br/>\nall feelings, not just the good.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were times and families (some still) in which children&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings were universally disregarded or punished.

I&#39;m  <br/>\nguessing Ryan has forbidden him to touch some of his things.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nguessing the parents backed Ryan up.  I&#39;m guessing the younger boy  <br/>\nfelt powerless and frustrated and was hoping for the same parental  <br/>\nbackup and protection of his own things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-He replied (this is verbatim), &quot;Yah, I&#39;m okay; it is just so hard  <br/>\nfor me to feel excited.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the thought of getting new toys was reminding him of too many  <br/>\nprior clashes over toys?  Would it help any if there were more toys  <br/>\nthat were not either of theirs specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little I already had some toys, and sometimes we&#39;d  <br/>\nbuy something and instead of it being one of theirs, or instead of me  <br/>\nsaying &quot;It belongs to both of you,&quot; I would say &quot;This one&#39;s mine.&quot;    <br/>\nThen I got to say who played with it (in their minds and in reality  <br/>\nboth) while they were learning to share and learning what &quot;mine&quot;  <br/>\nmeant.  &quot;Mine&quot; doesn&#39;t need to mean &quot;nobody else ever touches it.&quot;   <br/>\nBut when the other people are younger, that can be scary, the thought  <br/>\nthat they might not take care of the thing.  And when the other  <br/>\npeople are older and maybe better at arguments and physically  <br/>\nstronger, that&#39;s scary too.  Those fears produce stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I understand that being sad/angry/frustrated is okay,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be part of the problem.  While being sad, angry or  <br/>\nfrustrated should not be punishable offenses, that doesn&#39;t make them  <br/>\n&quot;okay&quot; in every sense of the word.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can help him avoid those things by making his life smoother  <br/>\nand safer and happier, you should!  All parents should, but for  <br/>\nunschooling parents it&#39;s part of the basic workings of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs (something that shows that learning  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take place under threat, and that hungry and scared people  <br/>\naren&#39;t in a state to learn much) says that for a person to be in a  <br/>\nreceptive state, in a happy state, there are basic needs that need to  <br/>\nbe taken care of first.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I understand that being<br/>\nsad/angry/frustrated is okay, but is it okay<br/>\nfor it to override excitement and happiness? Am I overlooking<br/>\nanything with helping him to feel supported?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of waiting until he&#39;s unhappy to wish he was being happy,  <br/>\nmake the happiness the goal and the priority.  Don&#39;t support the  <br/>\nfrustration, try to avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Am I overlooking<br/>\nanything with helping him to feel supported?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n From the story you told, it seems you might be using phrases that  <br/>\nsound like they came from a book instead of using your own, honest  <br/>\nvoice.  I&#39;ve never liked it when people have done that to me.  When  <br/>\npeople are changing their lives and learning new ways to be,  <br/>\nsometimes they take the advice of a book very literally and use the  <br/>\nexact phrase that was suggested.  Sometimes they keep on doing that  <br/>\nfor months or years, at which point they might be adding to the  <br/>\nstress instead of alleviating it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying &quot;I understand you&#39;re angry&quot; is better than saying &quot;Stop  <br/>\nwhining or I&#39;ll spank you.&quot;<br/>\nSo when one gets to that point of understanding, they should try to  <br/>\nmake even better choices about what to say in future instances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood!

And - don&#39;t ask  <br/>\nquestions at that time - it adds to the frustration because the poor  <br/>\nkid is already on overload and now you&#39;re expecting her to think  <br/>\nclearly about what it is she wants? Be honest and sympathetic - say,  <br/>\n&quot;Oh gosh, this place is kind of overwhelming. Let&#39;s go out and get  <br/>\nlunch or ice cream or something, for now, and maybe come back when  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t so busy.&quot; If she screams, &quot;NOOOOO I don&#39;t want to go,&quot;  <br/>\nthen you can move on, very gently, with, &quot;Oh, okay, then let&#39;s go  <br/>\nlook at the dolls for a while.&quot; In other words, you offer - don&#39;t  <br/>\nask. Then your response is based on her reaction. Try to develop your  <br/>\nown interpersonal intelligence as much as you can - try to think from  <br/>\nher point of view, try to offer what you think would help her be more  <br/>\nhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know that I<br/>\n&gt; need to be more observant and I am working my best at that. AND I am<br/>\n&gt; getting better, but meltdowns still happen (just much less than  <br/>\n&gt; they used<br/>\n&gt; to). What I really need to know is what I can do when the meltdown  <br/>\n&gt; is in<br/>\n&gt; progress. I asked Lil if she wanted to leave, but of course she  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t and<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t always know the words to express what is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just from your post, I felt like you&#39;re pressuring her (not meaning  <br/>\nto) and that might be some of the source of her frustration. I&#39;m  <br/>\npicturing a combination of you not thinking ahead well enough and you  <br/>\nexpecting her to be able to think ahead too well. Like, you might ask  <br/>\nher, &quot;Do you want to go to Toys-R-Us?&quot; and she says, &quot;Yes,&quot; and you  <br/>\njust take that as a complete answer. But you&#39;re the mom, you have to  <br/>\nthink deeper - why does she want to go, what is SHE thinking it will  <br/>\nbe like, when is a good time for her to be there, will she want to  <br/>\nsit in the cart or run around, is she thinking that &quot;go&quot; means &quot;buy  <br/>\ntoys&quot; or maybe &quot;play with toys?&quot; You have to think about &quot;her&quot; - the  <br/>\nreal child and what she can handle.<br/>\nAnd, below, you say maybe you&#39;re asking the wrong questions - I think  <br/>\nmaybe you&#39;re onto something there, but that it is that you&#39;re asking  <br/>\ntoo much of her. I think maybe you&#39;re just asking too many questions.  <br/>\nThink more in terms of offering, supporting, encouraging - less in  <br/>\nterms of &quot;asking&quot; her to decide or choose. I think you&#39;ll find that  <br/>\nreduced her frustration levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I am not asking the wrong questions. I know what I am doing  <br/>\n&gt; is the<br/>\n&gt; wrong way to deal with things. What I struggle with is having a  <br/>\n&gt; substitute<br/>\n&gt; available for when *I* make mistakes. Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. So - from now on, before you go somewhere, have some ideas in  <br/>\nmind. BEFORE you even bring it up to her, think, &quot;Okay, thinking  <br/>\nabout going to Toys-R-Us --- that means a series of possible  <br/>\nactivities -- (1) getting ready and maybe interrupting ongoing  <br/>\nactivities (2) car ride (3) time in the store (4) needing to leave  <br/>\nthe store (5) time spent in line (6) car ride afterward. You have to  <br/>\nconsider each of those - play out a couple of scenarios in your head  <br/>\nfor each so you have some options in mind before you even bring it up  <br/>\nto her.<br/>\n<br/>\nToys-R-Us is a pretty big deal stressful activity for a young child -  <br/>\ntook a fairly large amount of preparation - I might say: &quot;I&#39;m wanting  <br/>\nto go to Toys-R-Us and here is what I have in mind -- going in about  <br/>\nan hour, eating a sandwich before we go, getting dressed in pants and  <br/>\nshirt and shoes, listening to our new Beatles cd in the car on the  <br/>\nway, you can sit in the cart or walk around the store and look at  <br/>\ntoys and help me pick something out for your cousin&#39;s birthday  <br/>\npresent, if you find something you want to buy that costs less than  <br/>\n$5 we can buy that, too. Does that all sound okay to you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child might have something to say about all this - &quot;Mom, can we  <br/>\nhave turkey sandwiches?&quot; or &quot;I want to sit in the cart.&quot; Or whatever  <br/>\n- me listing what I have in mind, what I&#39;m picturing happening, is an  <br/>\ninvitation for her to add to it or object to parts of it, but mostly  <br/>\nit means we are less likely to get into a situation where we have  <br/>\nvery different expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on past experience, with my middle child, I would also have  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;This is one of those stores that can be totally overwhelming,  <br/>\nso if you start to feel like that, just say so and we&#39;ll cut it short.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIF she had a meltdown in Toys-R-Us, I would figure out what the  <br/>\nproblem was and learn from it in order not to bring it about again.  <br/>\nGeneralize to other similar situations. Did I not feed her enough  <br/>\nbefore we left so she was a little hungry? Then next time, bring some  <br/>\ncrackers or cheese or granola bars or something along for her to  <br/>\nmunch on in the car on the way. Was it too much to expect her to help  <br/>\nshop for toys for another child? Then eliminate that problem by not  <br/>\nasking her to do it again - or maybe let her pick out something for  <br/>\nherself at the same time. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might be, like me, really sensitive to the sound in big stores  <br/>\nand shopping malls - that horrible &quot;echo&quot; kind of sound creates a lot  <br/>\nof stress in me - over a period of half an hour the stress builds up  <br/>\nand it is like I start not being able to think, all I can do is sort  <br/>\nof protect my brain from that background sound. I get cranky, short- <br/>\ntempered, really really tired. I&#39;ve mentioned this to people who  <br/>\nclaim they don&#39;t even know what &quot;sound&quot; I&#39;m talking about - so  <br/>\nobviously it doesn&#39;t affect everyone the same way. I like the &quot;idea&quot;  <br/>\nof going shopping - hanging out with my friends or daughters and  <br/>\nlooking, together, at clothes and things, but the reality of it, for  <br/>\nme, is not at all comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - YOU have to figure this out - you are like a detective in a way,  <br/>\nor a psychiatrist, trying to understand what your own child is like  <br/>\nbased on all the clues/evidence. You come to understand how she is  <br/>\nexperiencing the world, and then you try to support her in ways that  <br/>\nwork best for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321996436,"authorName":"missalexmissalex","from":"&quot;missalexmissalex&quot; &lt;missalexmissalex@...&gt;","profile":"missalexmissalex","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: anger and sadness in 5 yo","postDate":"1194546418","msgId":31353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZndmtkaStvazA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0NDhkZTA3NDM1Zjk5ZmIyOGJlZjAxYTIxNjU1ZDNmQGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":31352,"nextInTopic":31354,"prevInTime":31352,"nextInTime":31354,"topicId":31333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Toys R Us makes me really anxious too.

The <br/>\nexample that I bring to you today is: I took the boys shopping for <br/>\nsome cheap-o toys, just for fun. They were browsing around, picking <br/>\nup a few things, here and there, when all of a sudden the 5 year old <br/>\nyells at me, &quot;Ryan (8 yo) CAN NOT TOUCH ANY of my things. These are <br/>\nmine!&quot; I responded, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want Ryan to touch your new <br/>\nthings, hmm, I see&quot; The conversation went on like this <br/>\na couple of times when he screamed out &quot;Stop talking to me! I HATE <br/>\nYOU!!&quot;. So, I crouched down, said, &quot;It is okay for you to be angry at <br/>\nme, or frustrated, or WHATEVER, but it is NOT okay for you to yell at <br/>\nme&quot; He just collapsed in my arms for a hug. SO we make our purchases <br/>\nand we get to the car and I asked him if he was okay. He replied <br/>\n(this is verbatim), &quot;Yah, I&#39;m okay; it is just so hard for me to feel <br/>\nexcited.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any suggestions how we can work through these hard <br/>\nfeelings?
