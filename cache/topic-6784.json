My kids probably know more interesting things <br/>\nto say about it than I do &lt;G&gt;. I never planned an &quot;inertia&quot; experiment for <br/>\nthem, to make sure they knew about it. I took them to science museums though. <br/>\nBut even THERE I didn&#39;t make sure they learned about inertia. They could have <br/>\ngone to the same science museum 20 times and ignored that topic altogether <br/>\nbecause they were busy with other stuff.
