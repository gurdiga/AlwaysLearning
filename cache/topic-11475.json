I take one out every day or two and let it thaw in the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2007416313\">We eat a lot of tofu...just buy firm or extrafirm tofu and always put <br/>\nit straight into the freezer. I take one out every day or two and let <br/>\nit thaw in the fridge. Freezing completely changes the texture and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t use it any other way (except to make smoothies - then I use the <br/>\nsilken style - unfrozen). To use it I don&#39;t bother with the boiling <br/>\nthat most people recommend, I just cut off a chunk, rinse it a little, <br/>\nand squeeze it, like a sponge, to get rid of some  of the moisture. ANY <br/>\nmarinade works well with tofu - it absorbs flavors like crazy. A good <br/>\nway to get started is to just buy the bottled marinades that are sold <br/>\nin the barbeque sauce section of the grocery store. I&#39;ve used citrus <br/>\nand teriyaki and garlic and soutwestern and traditional barbeque and <br/>\nothers. Just bake in the oven spread out on a cookie sheet - 300 <br/>\ndegrees for 20 minutes or so - depends on how you&#39;ve sliced it.  Then <br/>\nyou can slice and use in sandwiches or other ways. I&#39;ve used the <br/>\nbarbequed style in the sauce served on mashed potatoes, the citrus <br/>\nstyle with rice and almonds or with noodles, the teriyaki I cut into <br/>\nchunks and use in stir fry of various kinds. I also roll chunks of <br/>\ngarlicky tofu in crushed cornflakes and fry them or bake them - kids <br/>\nreally really like those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make a variation of a really easy-to-make Persian soup, called <br/>\n&quot;Eshkeneh&quot; - slice 2 white onions and saute in a little oil. Add to 4 <br/>\ncups of water, 1 tsp or 2 tsp of turmeric, 1/2 tsp pepper, and some <br/>\nsalt and 1/4 cup of dried mint and a couple of cups of tofu chunks -- <br/>\nbring to boil, simmer for 20 minutes. Add a few eggs - just crack and <br/>\ndrop into the soup and then cook for another couple of minutes. You can <br/>\nleave out the eggs. Serve with warm bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these are with tofu that has been frozen and thawed. I chop it <br/>\nup and put in into all kinds of things -- it crumbles, too, if you <br/>\nsqueeze out more moisture, so you can add Italian seasonings to it and <br/>\nuse it for spaghetti sauce or Mexican seasonings and use it in burritos <br/>\nor tacos. Now that grocery stores carry more tofu-based products (the <br/>\nbig superstores do), I buy already prepared  tofu products - I bought <br/>\nsomething called &quot;Tofu Steak&quot; the other day - it was a southwestern <br/>\nflavor - nothing I couldn&#39;t have done myself - but the sauce was good. <br/>\nThere was a mango flavored one too - but nobody in my family liked it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, January 6, 2003, at 09:02 AM, Betsy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **I think people needs healthy oils in this world of nasty oils.**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes.

Get the silken tofu <br/>\nand blend about half a container into some frozen OJ concentrate, frozen <br/>\nberries (strawberries, raspberries, whatever you like) Soy milk and maybe a <br/>\nbanana if you like.<br/>\nJust play with the amounts and ingredients, you&#39;ll find lots of neat combos. <br/>\nThe tofu makes it extra creamy and smooth. You can add supplements if you <br/>\nlike also.<br/>\nThat&#39;s how I got Flax seed oil into my kids when they needed it.....<br/>\nI will post more, but must get ready for work right now.<br/>\nOh, one other way my kids love tofu is drained really well (the extra firm), <br/>\nsliced and fried in Olive oil with some Spike seasoning sprinkled on top. <br/>\nGreat for breakfast!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.
