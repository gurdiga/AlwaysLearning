She thinks I&#39;m not going to &quot;get what I need.&quot; <br/>\ni eased her <br/>\nmind by proving that I can still obtain the Bright<br/>\nFutures <br/>\nscholarship through homeschool, but she still thinks<br/>\nI&#39;m going to <br/>\nhave no friends and that I&#39;m lazy, reclusive, etc. <br/>\nDoes anyone have <br/>\nany suggestions of how i can get the legal issues<br/>\nstraightened out <br/>\nand how I can calm my mom down.  Also, I really want<br/>\nto quit ASAP!  <br/>\nSchool isn&#39;t healthy for me at all.  I&#39;m not learning<br/>\nand I&#39;m <br/>\nbecoming very depressive and bored.  Busy work is SUCH<br/>\nA WASTE OF <br/>\nTIME, but my mom wants me to stay in until the end of<br/>\nthe semester <br/>\nand then she&#39;ll &quot;think about it.&quot;  I&#39;m to the point<br/>\nwhere I&#39;m about <br/>\nto just stop going, so any help would be great!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to getting to meet you guys. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Rick<br/>\nP.S.

He asked so many questions that the guy<br/>\nlater came to me to find out how old he was and then told me they should<br/>\nlet ten year olds go to college.  (he meant it in a nice way)   Another<br/>\ncouple there took a liking to him when they found out his name is Dylan<br/>\nThomas, like the poet, and that he could recite rather dramatically, &quot;Do<br/>\nNot Go Gentle Into That Goodnight&quot;.<br/>\nI of course had to carry in my backpack the five hundred pounds of rocks<br/>\nhe collected along the way.   They are now spread out on my good platter<br/>\nlike a Thanksgiving turkey in the middle of the table, and will probably<br/>\nbe there for days while he looks at all of them under the microscope. <br/>\nDylan was merciful and didn&#39;t ask me to go walking with him this morning,<br/>\nand he has a Karate class this afternoon and he&#39;ll be going strong but<br/>\nI&#39;ll be lucky if I make it up the stairs to the Dojo. <br/>\nI do know more today about two 50 million year old volcanoes though and<br/>\nall it cost me was some Arnica gel and vitamin C.  <br/>\nWere going camping this weekend and there&#39;s a 14 mile hike we&#39;ve been<br/>\nplanning so I&#39;ll have to do my whining now and get it out of my system.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9302,"nextTopicId":9312}}
