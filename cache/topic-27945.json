But in a broader discussion of when does school become a better option than homeschooling/ unschooling, i would say as long as the child and parent both desire to unschool, and the environment isnt one that a child would want an 8 hour daily escape from, then unschooling is almost always better. &quot;Cynicism and unhappiness&quot; occur quite <br/>\nfrequently in the school setting, so i don&#39;t neccarily see it as a salve to those particular problems. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  I&#39;m so glad to see this come up now.  Just yesterday I was on the phone with my sister.  I asked how the home/unschooling is going and how her son is enjoying high school.  After years of being a huge proponent of public schooling and NEED for education, my sister pulled her kids out of school after moving to Memphis, TN in Feb 05.  Her son was 12 (almost 13 then) and her daughter 6.  She went into it relaxed, thinking she&#39;d put together her own curriculum. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Gradually, she drifted into unschooling something that looked like it wanted to be unschooling.  Not really unschooling, tho I shared with her lots of links, info, answers to questions, etc.  Her dh is really not on board, thinks they&#39;re doing their daughter a disservice.  My first thought was that it&#39;s always better to get the kids home.  I&#39;m having to reconsider this thought.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  This past spring my nephew visited for a few weeks.  He had already decided then that he&#39;d be returning to school in the fall -- this past August.  In talking with him about this -- my sister had asked me to &#39;talk him into staying home&#39; -- I learned why he wanted to return to school.  They don&#39;t go anywhere -- my sister has health issues, they have only car, she can&#39;t find any nearby groups/activities, etc.  I&#39;ve found local uschoolers for her. Gary and I&#39;ve gone most of the last year sharing one car, for a variety of reasons.  I have days when I don&#39;t feel well.  And yet, I find ways to get out with my kids -- I&#39;m sure she could, too, but she doesn&#39;t!  Her kids end up without social outlets; she doesn&#39;t manage to find a way to show her dh that the kids are learning.  In short, she&#39;s not succeeding at homeschooling.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Then yesterday, while talking about how my nephew is doing in school, she said something and I realized she just totally does not get unschooling or natural learning.  I had invited her to the last two conferences (she could have stayed with me and saved hotel money this past year) but she didn&#39;t make either one.  She has family and friends in Dallas and could easily hit the RE conference, but hasn&#39;t.  I&#39;m beginning to worry that she is doing her kids a disservice, by simply not doing anything consistently enough. I know her well enough to guess that she&#39;s simply overwhelmed and doesn&#39;t feel she has the resources to do any more than she&#39;s doing.  Maybe that&#39;s true -- I just don&#39;t know anymore.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just don&#39;t see her overcoming the obstacles to true unschooling in her house -- or even some kind of relaxed, eclectic homeschooling.  I&#39;m sad to hear her daughter now talking about returning to school -- and my sister telling her that before she can go back, they need to &#39;make progress&#39; or she&#39;ll never pass the test for grade placement.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I guess what bothers me most is that it&#39;s not that unschooling failed them, but that my sister failed to really get/live/share unschooling in a way that helped her children.  I&#39;m beginning to think, given my sister&#39;s underlying traditional mindset, that her kids really are better off in school. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Gary (dh)<br/>\n  Will (22) Andy (10-1/2) and Dan (6) <br/>\n   <br/>\n      Peace is the vibrant space which stimulates the dance of kindness, merriment and freedom. ~ unknown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com\">http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Get your own web address.<br/>\n Have a HUGE year through Yahoo!

Am I doing more damage than good trying to unschool him while I <br/>\nwork on these issues I have?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to be wondering if it would be better to unschool while <br/>\nworking on her issues, even if it isnt the &quot;perfect&quot; (for lack of a <br/>\nbetter word)unschooling that many of us describe, or because this <br/>\nmight take her awhile would her son be better off in school. I guess <br/>\nits a reasonable thing for a scared/unsure newbie mom of a 12 yr old <br/>\nto wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWildflower responded &quot;But I think that as long as children are <br/>\nhaving basic needs met, food, shelter, and love, they are better off <br/>\nbeing unschooled.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person feels that the mountain is so high they can&#39;t possibly <br/>\nget to the top &quot;in time&quot;, should they not bother to climb at all? I <br/>\nwould say, climb as quickly as you can, one boot in front of the <br/>\nother, and don&#39;t worry about the top right now, just take it one <br/>\nstep at a time and try your best to climb as much as you can <br/>\n*today*, if it seems that overwhelming to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess since my son had such a traumatizing experience in school <br/>\n(that he still sometimes talks about over three years later), it <br/>\nwould take ALOT of unhappiness in our home for me to think school <br/>\nwas a better option. I wouldnt recommend someone do a half-assed job <br/>\nof unschooling, or live in an unhappy, negative home. But yeah, i <br/>\nthink even a home that consists of the kind of &quot;benign neglect&quot; that <br/>\nsome parents try to pass off as unschooling is almost always <br/>\npreferable to most school experiences. It can be so much better than <br/>\nthat though, and i would encourage any parent not to settle for less.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Discussion","postDate":"1170832804","msgId":27951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDREM0Y5QTM4LUZFMDYtNDJBMy1BNjA5LUM1RTgyMDM5MjU2MUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVxYmphbCtvdjFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGVxYmphbCtvdjFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27949,"nextInTopic":27952,"prevInTime":27950,"nextInTime":27952,"topicId":27945,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She (niece) usually stays in her room and reads. Would i <br/>\never encourage her mother to homeschool? No, i think school is <br/>\nprobably an escape for my niece. But if her mother was willing to <br/>\nput forth even a *minimal* amount of effort towards spending quality <br/>\ntime with her daughter, or occasionally getting out to do <br/>\nfun/interesting things, then i would say homeschooling *would* be <br/>\nbetter. She has those less-than-ideal parents whether or not she <br/>\ngoes to school, school just adds a whole other layer of stress to <br/>\nher life. She sees our life, and knows it could be different for <br/>\nher, but it won&#39;t be--not at home, not at school, and thats sad. <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, this list isnt a place where we&#39;d want to encourage &quot;good <br/>\nenough&quot; unschooling, or minimal effort. But in a broader discussion <br/>\nof when does school become a better option than <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling, i would say as long as the child and <br/>\nparent both desire to unschool, and the environment isnt one that a <br/>\nchild would want an 8 hour daily escape from, then unschooling is <br/>\nalmost always better. &quot;Cynicism and unhappiness&quot; occur quite <br/>\nfrequently in the school setting, so i don&#39;t neccarily see it as a <br/>\nsalve to those particular problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter that the parents continue to unschool, and work on the <br/>\nbehavior than decide &quot;well i&#39;m not cut out for unschooling&quot; and put <br/>\nthe kids back in school.
