My bestfriend and I are at odds with the whole <br/>\nhomeschooling, attachment parenting life styles. We can talk about our extended <br/>\nfamilies; parents, grandparents, siblings, etc. We can talk about her work, and <br/>\nour husbands, and other friends. But we absolutely cannot talk about my <br/>\nhomeschooling or anything that has to do with attachment parenting. She of the <br/>\nbottle-feeding because she just can&#39;t bear to think about anyone at her breast. Let <br/>\nthe baby cry it out, because they will never learn to sleep or be independent <br/>\notherwise. They have to do homework, go to school, or they will never learn how <br/>\nto socialize, do tests, or any other canned response you choose to insert <br/>\nhere. I just love her, she is like my sister. BUT we just can&#39;t talk about some <br/>\nof the most important things in my life and as you know, that just plain hurts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we were talking about her cousin (also a friend of mine), who <br/>\nis about to have a baby. We were talking about how anal the cousin is about her <br/>\nbabies, and my friend told me that she doesn&#39;t understand why she is that way <br/>\nbecause, (quoting here) &quot;babies have immunities from their mother that last <br/>\nfor months&quot; I said yes that is true if the baby is being breastfed...  insert <br/>\nlonggggg heated discussion here... we ended up getting off the phone angry with <br/>\neach other. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t know how this helps you. But I do understand, as I am sure most <br/>\nhere do too. I wish there were easy answers. I would suggest giving your sister <br/>\nsome books on the subject and referring her to some of the articles on <br/>\nSandra&#39;s site and telling her you are happy to discuss any questions she may have <br/>\nAFTER she reads some. Although, to me, that sounds like assigning her homework, <br/>\nbut if it works... I&#39;ve tried this tactic with my bestfriend, my MIL, and my <br/>\nown sister, so far they all insist on knowing what they know and being closed <br/>\nminded about the whole thing. My MIL said that for every book or article I could <br/>\nproduce on homeschooling, she could produce one that proved it would never <br/>\nwork. While I don&#39;t doubt she could go article to article with me, I wonder that <br/>\nshe could ever find as many anti-homeschooling books as homeschooling books. <br/>\nI hate to be negative about it, and I hope it works for you. I did finally <br/>\ntell my bestfriend that I just couldn&#39;t listen to her complaining about her kids <br/>\nschool, homework, teachers, and class mates because she knows how I feel about <br/>\nall of that. And when she asks me what I would do in such and such situation, <br/>\nI remind her that I am living example of what I think she should do. I guess <br/>\nthat would be my best advice, always be a living example. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople always call it luck when you&#39;ve acted more sensibly than they have. <br/>\nAnne Tyler <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I am so frustrated with family.... anyone\tout there will...","postDate":"1064730103","msgId":16460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCOUJDQzA3LjM1RjFFJWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyOS4zMjAwNjk1NC4yY2E3ZDNmM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16459,"nextInTopic":16462,"prevInTime":16459,"nextInTime":16461,"topicId":16459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
