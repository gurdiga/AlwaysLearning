I mean, doesn&#39;t that prove that<br/>\npublic schools cause violent crime? Where are the cameras? Where is<br/>\nDan Rather? Where is the CBS Evening News team condemning public<br/>\nschools for the crime they foster by compelling kids to be in<br/>\nschool? Feel free to send a copy of this link, this story, to Dan<br/>\nRather on CBS Evening News.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I wonder what would happen if everyone sent every story about<br/>\nevery crime, at least the ones that we hear about, that takes place<br/>\nin our public schools to Dan Rather. Stories about every child <br/>\nmolesting teacher or coach, about every teacher who sends <br/>\npornographic photos of students out, every robbery, every weapon <br/>\nconfiscated, every child threatened or beaten or intimidated.  Do you <br/>\nthink he would see the light and stop drawing terribly flawed <br/>\nconclusions in his news reporting? <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, too, that these are schools which all tax-payers are<br/>\nforced to support and which all children are forced by compulsory<br/>\nattendance laws to attend, except for those rich enough to send their<br/>\nkids to private or parochial schools, or those who have loving caring<br/>\nand sacrificing parents who elect to school them at home. Do you<br/>\nthink Dan Rather would comprehend that his logic and his reporting on<br/>\nthe homeschool stories last week were convoluted? I wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is Dan Rather, by the way, who is still defending his bias in <br/>\nreporting the two episodes of CBS Evening News last week. Maybe the <br/>\nshows sponsors would like to read the stories about public school <br/>\ncrime?<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16760,"nextTopicId":16854}}
