Yes, we&#39;ve all  <br/>\nhad babies, but ther are other things we&#39;ve all known and done that  <br/>\naren&#39;t appropriate to an unschooling discussion too, so I&#39;m  <br/>\nuncomfortable going more deeplyinto toddler details.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principles, though, we could discuss.  Parents can&#39;t make  <br/>\ndecisions about parenting if the space isn&#39;t theirs.

Try changing him standing. I  rarely <br/>\nhad the change struggle doing this. I watch parents trying to keep  their kids <br/>\nlaying down and it&#39;s pure stress and really a parent/child struggle  that&#39;s <br/>\nunnecessary esp for boys..<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as the kitchen it sounds that by implementing the &quot;rules&quot;  in  the <br/>\nkitchen this may have created more of an issue. In our home nothing is off  <br/>\nlimits. I understand you are not in your own home and that is a challenge for  all <br/>\nincluding your unschooling goal. By not creating rules to be challenged  there <br/>\nis less time spent trying to find out what all the fuss is about.<br/>\n <br/>\nOff limits to a child can mean everything but do not touch. Their brains  are <br/>\nin explore mode, they want to know and see. I understand the carrier however  <br/>\nI doubt that it just being newly implemented is going to work. Being safe is  <br/>\nimportant though I also see it as confining a child who doesn&#39;t want to be  <br/>\nthere. Weather it&#39;s a happy carrier or a leash/harness it&#39;s still a restraint  <br/>\n&quot;IF&quot; they are not wanting to be in it.<br/>\n <br/>\n My Cameron is 26 mo now and we just passed the being one-to-all  hurdle. I <br/>\nDO remember trying to cook dinner while he wanted to be held or  was fussy. <br/>\nWhen my solutions failed I simply stopped making dinner until DH  came home to <br/>\ntake over the cooking or the baby. Pre-cooking works  too.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for your sleep..zzz I do hear you also. I have four so the best way for  <br/>\nme to get what I need to get done and have that little more time with the  <br/>\nolder&#39;s is to stay up later. I also have a business at home.. we raise and/or  <br/>\nbreed 6 Brittany (spaniels), I do their shots, training, breeding, baths, food,  <br/>\nnew customer interviews and pick up, web site design/photo&#39;s ,banking and so <br/>\non  between the four kids and my DH wants /needs/hopes and dreams AND MINE. I <br/>\ndo  what I can at night time. I also have a web site for unschooling and two <br/>\nlists I  maintain. So I hear you! If your business is helping your finances I <br/>\nget that  too. I realize there are people who put their money above their family <br/>\nbut when  struggling to survive or get out of a hole it can be frustrating. <br/>\nDo what  you can in time the rest will come. <br/>\n <br/>\nYou said he drinks a bottle,, Can you offer the bottle to DH so you  can do <br/>\nthe things to finalize the day? <br/>\nIs it possible to stay up later? If you are still in bed in the am will the  <br/>\n18 mo old sleep longer? <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the end you are talking about an 18 mo and unschooling him. There are  <br/>\nmany things that can follow(mock) unschooled parenting. You need to figure  out <br/>\nwhat works for this child.<br/>\n I also know that unschooling in this situation mixed with  the age may be <br/>\nsending him mixed messages which I suspect is where you  are getting an upset <br/>\nchild. <br/>\n <br/>\nI wonder where the 11 yo comes into play?

Giving him something he CAN play with may prevent him from finding things he can&#39;t.  Ada likes pots, measuring cups, measuring spoons, wooden spatulas/spoons, a collander, etc<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t have too much success babywearing in the kitchen either just because there isn&#39;t enough movement/action for Ada, since she got to be a toddler.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Diaper changes: when Ada started walking, she started hating lying down for a change.  I have cloth dipes that snap on the sides.  I started snapping them up first (or snapping one side) then sticking her legs through the holes while she is standing and pulling them up her.  So if she is wet and running around, I get her to hold still standing up, unsnap and whip away the old dipe, wipe her with a washcloth, pull the new dipe up, and off she goes.  She does not seem to mind being held still standing up, and I always talk to her while doing it.  It has worked wonders!  I do also EC, by the way ;-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Leaving the park: It helps tremendously with my toddler to say, &quot;we have to go home now.  Say bye-bye to the swings,&quot; and let her pat the swings.  When she says, &quot;Swings!&quot; in a longing voice, I say, &quot;yes, you did some good swinging, didn&#39;t you?  And you went down the red slide, and we had lots of fun doing . . . &quot; etc.  So we talk about having played as we walk to the car, and we say good-bye, and we might talk about where we&#39;re going next, or what fun toy is in the car to play with, or a snack or juice, etc.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Good luck!<br/>\n  Diana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toddler Issues","postDate":"1151452956","msgId":26179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVQTURIQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWM2OWExZCQ0ZDQzYjVkMCQ2NTAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":26178,"nextInTopic":26191,"prevInTime":26178,"nextInTime":26180,"topicId":26169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Christy, Your living situation is definitely a main issue here and needs to be rethought, I think.

I know that people have<br/>\ndifferent levels of interpersonal skill but if you are paying close<br/>\nattention to him, you should see the signs of neediness before it becomes a<br/>\nfull blown temper tantrum. Let him stand on a chair and help you do some<br/>\nthings that are safe. Playing in the sink was always a favorite or washing<br/>\nlettuce or potatoes or something.~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIt may sound like I am shooting down your ideas here but I really wish it<br/>\nwere possible to implement these things.  The kitchen is so very small that<br/>\nhaving a chair out by the sink would block access to the fridge and actually<br/>\naccess to the sink for me.  This is why I have tried using the carrier (hip<br/>\ncarry position) so he can help do things but he just wants down.  maybe I<br/>\njust need to figure out how to get dinner made without being in the kitchen<br/>\nfor very long at a time?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~I remember my sil&#39;s kids throwing huge tempter tantrums and she would<br/>\ngive<br/>\nthem a time out or a swat and it drove me NUTS because you could see the kid<br/>\nasking politely for attention a million times before he had a fit.~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nthis sounds like my sisters, sad but true.  <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~Some kids just need a lot of time in arms too and just because you feel<br/>\nlike you&#39;ve held them all day doesn&#39;t mean that they feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>\nenough.~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nthis is why I got the carrier, thinking it would help but so far he hasn&#39;t<br/>\nwanted to be in it much.  I am thinking about taking walks in the evening<br/>\nwith him in the carrier (as long as he wants to) so we can both get used to<br/>\nit more.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~OH, and one more thing. Stop counting how many hours of sleep you got. I<br/>\nused to do that and it just set me up to have an excuse to get short<br/>\ntempered when I got tired.~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is not really the hours of sleep, it is the feeling of always being tired<br/>\nand completely worn out due to lack of sleep.  When I get quality sleep even<br/>\na couple of nites a week, I am fine but several nights/weeks of very little<br/>\nare starting to take their toll.  <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~How much do you need the extra income from the<br/>\npart time job? More than you need sleep? What can you live without to make<br/>\nup for it?~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as needing the income, we are trying desperately to get out of debt<br/>\nso we can get out of my fil&#39;s house and have our own.  We have no &quot;extras&quot;<br/>\nto cut out, believe me, I have tried and tried to figure out how to get out<br/>\nof this house.  I have also tried and tried to figure out how to change my<br/>\nperspective about living here and make it more kid friendly but I am up<br/>\nagainst a man who is set in his ways and thinks I am spoiling the kids and<br/>\nnot strict enough as it is.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really appreciate the thoughts and ideas and I will try to implement them<br/>\nas much as possible.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nChristy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nUnschooling Mom to Aden (1) and Seth (11)<br/>\nLoving wife of Chet (ann. 7/4/04)<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my blog &/or join my group:<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture\">http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture\">http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go confidently in the direction of your<br/>\ndreams.

I am very new to the respectful<br/>\nparenting style let alone unschooling.  I am sure my issues are not unique<br/>\nand I am not here to whine and complain, just to get some suggestions on how<br/>\nI can better handle some situations.  Our family goal is peace which<br/>\nincorporates mutual respect so in each instance I am wanting to respect<br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs.  I will try to be as complete as possible without making<br/>\nthis email too long.<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst issue, throwing fits.  I say fits because these are not tantrums where<br/>\nhe throws himself down kicking and screaming.  It is more like screaming and<br/>\ncrying so hard he gags.  He does this any time he does not get his way.  The<br/>\nbiggest fits come when he is not ready to get in the car after being<br/>\nsomewhere...anywhere.  If we have a choice of staying longer, we usually do<br/>\nbut there comes a time we have to leave and so ensues the fit.  Other major<br/>\nfit times are diaper changes.  He doesn&#39;t always cry to the point of gagging<br/>\nand he doesn&#39;t always throw a fit but it is often enough that I have either<br/>\njust let him wear the wet dipe for much longer than I like or just take it<br/>\noff and prolong putting another on.  I have even thought about doing EC but<br/>\nI am not disciplined enough to do that plus my dh would freak...lol.<br/>\nAnother time he throws fits is when he wants to be in the kitchen with me<br/>\nand I have to repeatedly tell him not to touch things to the point I cant<br/>\nget anything done.  I have tried putting him in the carrier and wearing him<br/>\nand I have tried putting him at the table with crayons and such but he wants<br/>\nto be down so he can touch things the only thing else I know to do is put<br/>\nhim in the living room where everything is safe and he can still see me and<br/>\nI can still talk to him and such.  When I do that he throws a fit.  I hope<br/>\nthis is good enough description but if you have questions please ask.<br/>\nOtherwise, please suggest things that have worked for you or that you have<br/>\nknown to work for other people.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSecond issue, lack of sleep.  I am not talking about Aden, its me.  Aden was<br/>\non a routine of sleeping by around 8 or so but gradually that has turned<br/>\ninto around 11:30 or so.  We do dinner, playtime, bath, nakey playtime,<br/>\nbooks, bottle, rocking, bed (or at least that is how it used to be).  Now,<br/>\nafter bottle he wants down to play then about 30 min later he wants back up<br/>\nand acts like he is going to go to sleep but then he pops his head up and is<br/>\nready to play again and about 30 min later again wanting to rock.  This<br/>\npattern goes on for however long with me getting frustrated all the while<br/>\nbecause I know what time I need to get up the next morning to either get<br/>\nSeth somewhere or heaven forbid I get to go to the Y and work out.  Not only<br/>\ndoes he stay up for what feels like forever, he tosses and turns most of the<br/>\nnight sometimes which causes even less sleep for me.  We are to a point<br/>\nwhere Seth can go to bed pretty much whenever as long as he is in bed when<br/>\nwe are (I am not ready to let go more than that yet...key word yet).  With<br/>\nAden I cant just go to bed and leave him to play which means I am getting<br/>\nmore and more sleep deprived and more and more depressed about everything.<br/>\nI cant sleep during the day when he takes a nap because that is the only<br/>\ntime I have to work my home biz.  I want him to learn his own body and such<br/>\nyet I need at least 8 hrs of sleep...10 is actually better for me but 8<br/>\nworks okay too.  So how do I encourage him to learn his own body and his own<br/>\nsleep needs while also getting my own sleep needs met or is that a pipe<br/>\ndream?<br/>\n <br/>\nIn Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nUnschooling Mom to Aden (1) and Seth (11)<br/>\nLoving wife of Chet (ann. 7/4/04)<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my blog &/or join my group:<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture\">http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture\">http://groups.myspace.com/unschoolingourfuture</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go confidently in the direction of your<br/>\ndreams.
