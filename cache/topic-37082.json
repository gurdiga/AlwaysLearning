I do imagine, though, that if I had chosen  to have <br/>\nchildren when I was much younger that I would have had more.  I  love everything <br/>\nabout my life as a mom and especially that I&#39;ve been able to  spend so much <br/>\nreally fun time with them.  I attribute much of our full rich  lives to <br/>\ndiscovering unschooling and choosing to embrace it.<br/>\n <br/>\nBrenna was talking today about being open to moving back to a closer  college <br/>\nafter this first year because it was so far away.  I&#39;m happy that  she&#39;s <br/>\nbrave enough and confident enough to go and I really think (like  Sandra said) <br/>\nthat with cell phones, e-mails and social networking that we will  stay in close <br/>\ncontact.  Her room will stay as it is and for now, she&#39;ll be  home for <br/>\nholidays and occasional weekends. I remember a 5 hour drive  not being so far when I <br/>\nwas 18..&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ll see her at the Live and Learn Conference two weeks after we  take <br/>\nher to college.  That will at least help with the initial driving  away from <br/>\nthe campus.  I&#39;m still not sleeping much this week, though.   Waking up at 3 <br/>\na.m. with those thoughts that seem so much worse before the sun  comes up.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLooking ahead, I have so many interests and find that I have more time to  <br/>\npursue them because the kids are older.  I&#39;m still at my happiest with a  house <br/>\nfull of kids playing games or when all four of us are together just  hanging <br/>\nout.  I look forward to grandchildren and maybe even unschooled  <br/>\ngrandchildren...&lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;m also looking forward to spending more time with my 15 year old  son.  <br/>\nBrenna and I have so many similar interests and can finish each  others <br/>\nsentences.  Logan and I not so much. It will be a very good  thing for the two of us to <br/>\nhave this time.<br/>\n <br/>\nDefinitely a new chapter coming up and I&#39;m hoping the reality is a bit  <br/>\neasier than I have imagined it to be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI loved the idea of her taking familiar things and she has been  choosing <br/>\nthings from her room and house today that she will take with her.   Also, the <br/>\ncare packages.  Very good idea.

They knew  <br/>\neach other already, and they decided who would provide what.  We  <br/>\noffered to let Kirby take things that would make his new place feel  <br/>\nhomey and he took some familiar kitchen things, and lamps, and his  <br/>\nown bed.  Some things like pillows helped.  That might be minor, but  <br/>\nknowing that we didn&#39;t say &quot;Get your own new stuff when you get  <br/>\nthere&quot; made it less a separation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had had to wait for a real paper letter or for a long distance  <br/>\nphone call, it would&#39;ve been harder on me, but with cell phones and  <br/>\ninstant message and e-mail and mySpace and all that, I can check in  <br/>\non him by asking Marty and Holly if they&#39;ve heard from him, first  <br/>\npass.  And now Holly&#39;s going out with (odd term, but I can&#39;t think of  <br/>\nthe just-right-one) one of Kirby&#39;s best friends, so Brett hears from  <br/>\nKirby too.  So I can get news without bugging him directly.  And he  <br/>\ncalls me sometimes when he&#39;s walking to work, which is just the right  <br/>\namount of time for him to update me and then he gets there and has to  <br/>\nturn his phone off so it&#39;s done. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have ordered him gifts and had them shipped straight there.  A USB  <br/>\ncannon (controlled by keyboard, and you shoot kind of nerf-dart  <br/>\nthings).  A peaceful background picture and music DVD for the giant  <br/>\nTV they bought together.  A Learn Nothing Day magnet (we gave him a  <br/>\nshirt when he came to visit).   And he orders from my Amazon account  <br/>\nsometimes, but uses his own charge card.  So I see what he ordered.   <br/>\nOF  COURSE he could get his own Amazon account, but he was used to  <br/>\nusing mine before, and he just still does.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Teens transitioning out","postDate":"1218490027","msgId":37082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkYi4zMTFhY2UyNC4zNWQyMDhhYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37083,"prevInTime":37081,"nextInTime":37083,"topicId":37082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a week, my almost 19 year old daughter leaves for college 217 miles from home.
