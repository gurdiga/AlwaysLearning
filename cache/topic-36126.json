Tastes terrible, so after we bought some and decided not to ruin a cake with it, it became backyard spray paint. It doesn&#39;t wash off any faster than the acrylic paint they fingerpainted onto the back porch, though. It&#39;s just not so toxic. One really cool ghosty face has lasted months.  We also used to spread a large (8&#39;x6&#39;) sheet of heavy plastic in the kitchen and give them paints (tempera, usually) and paper, or paper plates, or cardboard boxes, or small unfinished wooden things, or 25-cent baskets from the Salvation Army store.  Often they painted in their underwear, then ended up painting their bodies.  This offers still more fun in the tinted bath which follows.  Plastic comes in huge rolls available at hardware stores.  We also have spread it out on the floor to play in bubble stuff and in uncooked  grits, a winter &#39;sand.&#39;  When the fun is done, roll it up and<br/>\n throw the plastic out.  We have also recently built &#39;log cabins&#39; out of popsicle sticks from the dollar store. One house is very planned and tidy, and one is &quot;like the Weasley&#39;s house, all tippy.&quot;  Emily asked to paint something with acrylic paints again, so they are going to paint the picnic table. This resulted a few years ago in a porch with very sweet multicolored hand prints, etc. I can&#39;t wait to see what will end up on the picnic table this summer.  Cameron                        <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cool Stuff to do Thread","postDate":"1215200004","msgId":36130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdFNTkyQUU1LTY3MTYtNDVFNC1CRkEzLUZBNURBRjU4OEY4QkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM4ZGUwNCQxMzAzYzlmMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBNT01TPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyMTUxOTI2MDMuMTY1Mi45NTUzMC5tNDVAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAxMzAxYzhkZTA0JDEzMDNjOWYwJDY0MDFhOGMwQE1PTVM+"},"prevInTopic":36126,"nextInTopic":36156,"prevInTime":36129,"nextInTime":36131,"topicId":36126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Ohhhh, I m thinking of my 10-year-old Miss Sorscha!
