These are mostly national (country-wide) holidays, though apply to provincial/territorial holidays, too.   Sometimes, we call them &quot;provincial holidays&quot; when they are specific to a province or call them by what they commemorate (such as &quot;B.C. Day&quot; for when British Columbia became a province of Canada) or &quot;civic holiday.&quot;  Just about every province has a civic holiday on the first Monday in August.  In Quebec, June 24 is officially listed as &quot;National Day&quot;, but was always referred to as &quot;Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.&quot;  Clear as mud?
