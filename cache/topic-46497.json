How in the world do we<br/>\nknow that a kid who is forced to attend a learning portion of the museum<br/>\nis learning exactly what is supposed to be learned from it?  We have no<br/>\nway of knowing what goes on in someone else&#39;s head.  The kid could be<br/>\ntuning it all out and examing the patterns on the floor tiles, and I use<br/>\nthat as an example because that is what I would have done as a kid.  The<br/>\nkid could be thinking about the color of the sky outside and wondering<br/>\nwhy it&#39;s blue and not yellow.  If a kid must regurtitate the info, they<br/>\nmay pay just enough attention to be able to do that and then push it all<br/>\nout of their head afterwards, or read the museum boards, which again, is<br/>\nwhat I would have done after examing the floor tiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf given the freedom to explore the museum at my own pace and will, I<br/>\nstill would have examined the floor tiles and read the museum boards and<br/>\nalso the museum collections connected to the boards.  I would have<br/>\ngotten the free pamphlets from the place and taken them with to examine<br/>\nlater.  In fact, this is still the kind of thing I do.  I was never much<br/>\ninterested in guided tours or ranger talks or any of that stuff, I<br/>\nwanted to do my own thing at my own pace.

I would have thought <br/>\nEclectic homeschooler, if you need a helpful label. It takes more than <br/>\neschewing testing to be an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving requirements about following or participating in whatever programs at <br/>\nmuseums, even insisting on attendance, are some of the factors that take it <br/>\nout of being unschooling. I guess I&#39;d be curious to know what happens when <br/>\none or other of the kids says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever this is the idea I want to notice, as an example of a barrier to <br/>\nunschooling:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Once we had some basic life skills were mastered we let him direct his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learning. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have requirements, he isn&#39;t the director. But that&#39;s an aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that the specific of Dave was that he had extra challenges. <br/>\nHowever the broader principle is that all kids, all people, will have the <br/>\nneed to master basic life skills. There may be some debate over the fine <br/>\ndetails of what is a &quot;basic life skill&quot;, but in general everyone has areas <br/>\nto be mastered in order to live happily and comfortably in a community, <br/>\nincluding a famly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe &quot;mastered&quot; is too great a word too. Some of us are spending a lifetime <br/>\nimproving some of our basic life skills, especially as our circumstances <br/>\nchange. Maybe there is a point short of mastery that is &quot;good enough&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the tentpoles of unschooling is that everything counts. Therefore <br/>\nbasic life skills count as learning. This is exactly where the whole <br/>\n&quot;radical unschooler&quot; comes from - that children can be trusted to learn and <br/>\nmake good choices about their personal needs, daily living and life skills. <br/>\nMy daughter has come and is coming to competence in basic life skills in <br/>\nexactly the same way as she is learning to read and do math - in her own <br/>\nway, in her own order, and in her own rather erratic time - usually with <br/>\nannouncements about her thought processes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I have helped by making resources available, sometimes I have <br/>\nhindered by unasked for advice. But at no time was her freedom to then do <br/>\nthe other learning and creative work (and forays into academic thinking) <br/>\ntied to some timetable of having mastered some life skill or other. Frankly <br/>\nI can&#39;t understand how that would work. &quot;I&#39;ll trust you to learn to read <br/>\nwithout lessons only after you&#39;ve learnt to dress yourself, until then it&#39;s <br/>\nlessons and primers&quot;....&quot;Until you&#39;ve learnt to carry your plate to the <br/>\nkitchen yourself, I&#39;ll be choosing your tv shows&quot;....&quot;Oh you&#39;ve learnt to <br/>\nput your dirty clothes in the hamper. Great, now you get to choose what to <br/>\nstudy today.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I don&#39;t think Mary Ann said any of these absurd things. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink any real person has said any of these things. I&#39;m deliberately <br/>\nexaggerating to point out what unschoolers might see as the illogic of that <br/>\nposition that life skills have to be mastered first, before unschooling can <br/>\nbe allowed to begin; to notice the lack of clarity expressed with that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of  &quot;directing learning&quot; is another problematic concept for <br/>\nunschooling. It implies the separation of learning activities from living <br/>\nlife (oh just like the learning portion of the museum visit versus the free <br/>\ntime to play there). It makes it all sound deliberate, a pre-planned road <br/>\nmap (or train track) of learning with a final &quot;learnt that&quot; goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sure isn&#39;t how learning works around here. It is much more organic - <br/>\nintertwined with life, automatic, constant. The inner work has been done by <br/>\nthe time Jayn announces that &quot;3 and 12 make 15 because 5 and 5 and 5 make 15 <br/>\nand 3 and 2 are 5 and 5 and 5 are 10, see?&quot; or some amazing polysyllabic <br/>\nword pops out of her regular speech in perfect context.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us unschooling is about helping Jayn do what she wants to do (sometimes <br/>\nworking around her lack of life skills), without her having to earn the <br/>\nright to do it by demonstrating her mastery of one or more life skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

And then I advise them to the same for all their<br/>\nchildren and for all the people in their lives - help the people you<br/>\ncare about do what they are good at!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all the doctors, specialists, therapists, nutritionists, etc. had<br/>\nsaid this to me each time when we came to work them - it would have made<br/>\nsuch a difference in our lives!  For many years we taught to compensate<br/>\nfor Dave&#39;s weaknesses.  He obsessively read books - we were &quot;in trouble&quot;<br/>\nall the time at traditional school.  They tortured him for not being<br/>\nable to hold a pencil and creating art projects on demand (haven&#39;t<br/>\ncomputers made a joke about learning cursive and you should see him whip<br/>\nout a power point presentation!).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAround 9 or 10 he started to be able to recognize if he had food on his<br/>\nface after eating, he began to looked into our faces (I wept the first<br/>\ntime he looked deeply into my eyes - I had no idea his eyes were such a<br/>\nbeautiful color of green), he could recognize teachers and classmates<br/>\nwhen they were at the grocery store (but wouldn&#39;t know their names), he<br/>\ncould ask for help in a library, he stopped melting away to be found<br/>\nafter much searching under a picnic table, in a quiet corner of a<br/>\ncommunity center behind the bean bag chairs, in between racks of<br/>\nclothing in stores...  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we had some basic life skills were mastered we let him direct his<br/>\nlearning.  He&#39;s been &quot;traditional school free&quot; since after two months of<br/>\nsixth grade he was too stressed out to return.  He&#39;s worked with tutors<br/>\nin areas that interested him in math, science and history.  Now that he<br/>\nis 16, he&#39;s been taking 6-8 units of college classes on line for the<br/>\nlast two years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we travel across America I make it mandatory that both teens join us<br/>\nat the art, science and history museums - but once they see the film or<br/>\nhear the orientation talk, they are free to roam.   They must attend the<br/>\ntours offered by the rangers at the national parks and participate in<br/>\nlocal activities like fish boils, polka festivals, ferry riding,<br/>\nsledding in the snow or the white sands, farmers markets etc.  Dave is<br/>\nrequired to do household activities - he hooks up the tow car, cleans<br/>\nthe tile floors (he hates to vacuum - too loud), grocery shops and<br/>\nwashing the family laundry which his sister folds and puts away.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI meet people who don&#39;t think that studying the Oregon Trail by<br/>\nfollowing it as meaningful as reading about it in a book.  These same<br/>\ntypes of people think that spending two days at Abraham Lincoln&#39;s<br/>\nlibrary isn&#39;t much of a learning experience if there isn&#39;t a test at the<br/>\nend.  I wonder if they&#39;d consider experiencing a blizzard,<br/>\nsleet/snow/black ice, torrential rains, flooding, tornados, a part of a<br/>\nscience curriculum?  Dave decides what he wants to learn in the places<br/>\nwe are at traveling too.  Both kids read the travel books and help us<br/>\ndecide where to &quot;adventure&quot; to next.  But when we are there, I insist<br/>\nthat we live fully - do corn mazes, tour Nasa, hike Canyon de Chelly,<br/>\nvisit Thomas Edison&#39;s birthplace, visit mineral pools. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI always laugh about who is an unschooler.  The rest of the world views<br/>\nthat Dave doesn&#39;t &quot;do school.&quot;  I am not able to teach trigonometry at a<br/>\ncollege level and the five unit chemistry class we took together at the<br/>\nlocal college was extremely humbling for me - fortunately Dave was there<br/>\nto help tutor me.

Everyday things like shaking  <br/>\nhands and introducing himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent of a ten year old imagines that non-Asperger&#39;s kids are  <br/>\nall socially suave, that&#39;s not true.

I also do not think my son is &quot;broken&quot; and needs fixing. I love him and see him as he is. But when your child is &quot;typically&quot; developing and then one morning wakes up with no verbal skills, eye contact and is screaming for 4-6 hours at a time you feel helpless as a parent. So I took him to Childrens Hospital and he saw many specialist to find out why he lost every skill he has naturally obtained. It worried me. Then I found out almost 18 mo. later that he is diagnosed with Autism, it does help a bit. Autism is not who he is, it is a label but it does help others understand the way he responds to them. <br/>\nI love my son very much and Unschooling is a wonderful thing for him. It allows him to be him, there is no telling him to be &quot;normal&quot; or to stop making sounds when he is stressed out or to stop playing with his cars in an &quot;inappropriate way&quot;.( He likes to just stare at the wheels while he rolls them very close to his face on a table). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Maryann Malkoff&quot; &lt;maryann@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding the PPP thread, on a tangent about labels, I have a 16 yo son<br/>\n&gt; who is &quot;on the spectrum,&quot; was diagnosed before he was two, and his<br/>\n&gt; symptoms completely match the text book versions of Asperger Syndrome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Until he was eleven, I refused to let anyone label him.
