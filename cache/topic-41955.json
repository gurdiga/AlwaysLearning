I would love to hear stories of your kids and when they <br/>\nstarted to roll over, especially if they were &#39;late&#39; in doing so.====<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that children are always learning something, and it&#39;s <br/>\nusually not what you think they &quot;should&quot; be learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son never seemed particulary dexterous.  The whole rolling <br/>\nover thing was a little challenging for him.  He had a lot of trouble <br/>\nwith putting beads on a string as at toddler.  As a five years old, <br/>\ncoloring was a real challenge.  However, language was definately his <br/>\nthing.  He was speaking in complete sentences at 18 months, and by <br/>\nthe time he was two I could have an intelligent conversation with <br/>\nhim.  I was shocked to discover he could read shortly after his 4th <br/>\nbirthday.  It seems he put all of his focus into language and the <br/>\nwhole motor skills thing just didn&#39;t interest him.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine my suprise as I watched my second son develop.  At 11 months <br/>\nold I found him in the bathroom sink.  A few days later I found him <br/>\non the kitchen counter eating cookies.  At 18 months he was climbing <br/>\nstairs using alternating feet (a 3yo skill).  However, he wasn&#39;t <br/>\ntalking much by the time he was three.  He didn&#39;t know any of his <br/>\ncolors at four.  At five he still didn&#39;t know many of his body <br/>\nparts.  It seems he focused on motor skills and didn&#39;t pay much <br/>\nattention to language.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11 and 8, both of my boys are talking, reading, and running just <br/>\nfine.  While your little one may not be rolling over, she is <br/>\ncertainly focusing on some other goal.  If you continue to worry and <br/>\nfocus on the rolling over, you may interfere with the skill she is <br/>\nfocusing on.  Just continue to play with her and meet her needs, and <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry so much about what she&#39;s not doing.  Focus instead on all <br/>\nof the great things she is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Almost 6 months old - not turning over yet","postDate":"1234378551","msgId":41977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOTgxLjI5MzA3LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwNGQwMWM5OGM1YSQyZGU4ZGEzMCQ4OWJhOGU5MCRAbmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41971,"nextInTopic":41986,"prevInTime":41976,"nextInTime":41978,"topicId":41955,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son did not rollover until he was 7 months.
