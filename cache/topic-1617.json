It really rocked my<br/>\nworld, shifted my paradigm. Now I see huge bodies of knowledge of which I<br/>\nam almost totally ignorant, I can just see the outlines. My dad talks<br/>\nabout his butterflies and stamps, and both are really whole new worlds to<br/>\nme - even though I&#39;ve been using stamps and seeing butterflies for years<br/>\nand years. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a kid may never learn what &quot;that bug&quot; was, but he may learn all about<br/>\nstamp hinges and glues, or model trains, or human lactation, or weaving.<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s all okay...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

Then I moved to saying that I unschool except for Bible <br/>\nbased unit studies.  Now I&#39;m finally a total unschooler.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that for me, I was very willing to not worry about things like <br/>\nreading and history because those things are natural for me.  DD and I <br/>\nare both good at language related stuff and I see dd reading <br/>\nhistorical fiction so I don&#39;t see a need to worry about it.  Why would <br/>\nI worry about teaching spelling if spelling comes so naturally to us? <br/>\n<br/>\nMath, however, is another story.  I never really understood math.  It <br/>\nalways seemed so complicated.  Even with a mom who is a math teacher <br/>\nwho spent hours with me at night getting me through my math homework, <br/>\nI barely passed my algebra, geometry, and trig and I absolutely hated <br/>\nit.  Even my basic math skills aren&#39;t the greatest.  So because I saw <br/>\nmath as this complicated monster, I figured we had to come up with a <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; curriculum that would teach the &quot;basics&quot;.   I thought <br/>\nthat I certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to teach it naturally since I had <br/>\nno natural ability in that area. I finally gave up after dd got so <br/>\nfrustrated that there was nothing more I could do for her, no matter <br/>\nhow good the curriculum or how clearly I explained.  Not long after I <br/>\n&quot;gave up&quot;, she came to me asking for help figuring out how much more <br/>\nmoney she needed to buy an American girl doll.  Everytime she earned <br/>\nmore money, she did math.  She learned double and triple digit <br/>\naddition and subtraction, with carrying and borrowing, in a matter of <br/>\nweeks. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who likes the idea of unschooling but worries that <br/>\nshe&#39;s &quot;not smart enough&quot;.  She said that &quot;smart&quot; people know  how to <br/>\nanswer their children&#39;s questions on the spot and know enough in their <br/>\nown heads to point stuff out without planning ahead of time.  I do see <br/>\nthat she has a point.  Your child asks you what kind of insect is <br/>\ncrawling on a rock and you immediately tell her the name of the bug <br/>\nand a really interesting fact versus telling her you will look it up <br/>\nwith her later, and either you forget to look it up or when you do, <br/>\nshe has lost interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269338,"authorName":"Cindy","from":"Cindy &lt;crma@...&gt;","profile":"crma53","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling not working??","postDate":"1009477138","msgId":1617,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMkI2NjEyLjZDRjJCMzM1QGl4Lm5ldGNvbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIyNzA5MDgxNC4wMjM0NTU2MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1625,"prevInTime":1616,"nextInTime":1618,"topicId":1617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
