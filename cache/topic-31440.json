It&#39;s wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for me, that link was outdated.  (It&#39;s fixed now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut luckily for me, Robyn and a guy in England whose name I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow, my address worked fine and I could contact Robyn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I love cellphones.  I tried to call Robyn, called her husband  <br/>\nJames who gave me the house phone number (I had saved cellphone  <br/>\nnumbers from when I picked them up at the train station when they  <br/>\ncame to Albuquerque for the Live and Learn conference)...   and I  <br/>\nknow I still haven&#39;t gotten to the point, but that&#39;s part of what  <br/>\nenables the excitement, is the very many things that led up to it,  <br/>\nmost of which we&#39;ll never even know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I could talk to Robyn quickly; that was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the e-mail I got:<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent this email to Robyn at the address for her I found on your  <br/>\nwebsite, but it bounced. If you have a more up-to-date email address  <br/>\nfor her, please could you forward it on to her?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nVoid<br/>\n<br/>\nBegin forwarded message:<br/>\nFrom: The Void &lt;......<br/>\nDate: 12 November 2007 18:25:53 GMT<br/>\nTo: dezigna@(the wrong address)<br/>\nSubject: Elimar: a video<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Robyn,<br/>\n<br/>\nI found your address after searching google for &quot;Elimar juggler&quot;. A  <br/>\nfriend passed on a VHS to me with this video clip on it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juggling.tv/vaults/view_video.php?\">http://www.juggling.tv/vaults/view_video.php?</a> <br/>\nviewkey=18cc9daa29cf58af7a00<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought you would like to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nVoid<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nJUST TODAY, November 12, this guy had put up video of Robyn&#39;s dad  <br/>\njuggling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn had NO video images of her father.  She has very few photos.    <br/>\nShe was a little choked up and a lot happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get to all the other links referenced above from this, and  <br/>\nsee the video clips too:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/jugglingrobyn\">http://sandradodd.com/jugglingrobyn</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe only link that comes up right now if you google Elimar juggler is  <br/>\nthat page.<br/>\nSoon, the other page will show as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m giddy.  This is very exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31453,"nextTopicId":31462}}
