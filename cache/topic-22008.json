Except I&#39;m here to refute a lot of it because I &quot;know&quot; <br/>\notherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if as soon as a baby is born the mother and baby are left <br/>\nto connect<br/>\nthen the bond is set for life and the hormones that are released <br/>\nbecause of this<br/>\ncreates a special emotion which will ensure the baby gets the Mothers <br/>\nlove whole<br/>\nand unconditional. Any intervention at this time stops the normal <br/>\nbonding and<br/>\ncan stop that necessary flow of love. I know this because I feel it in <br/>\nthe<br/>\ndepths of my being and because I know the lack of connection I felt <br/>\nafter the<br/>\nbirth of both my boys because they were not given to me straight away.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBonding&#39;s nice, but that&#39;s a crock. I know adopted children who never <br/>\nsaw their birth moms, but who are happy and contented, who receive <br/>\ntheir adoptive moms&#39; whole and unconditional love. I know moms whose <br/>\nchildren were put to the breast immediately, yet who can&#39;t stand to be <br/>\naround their own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that co-sleeping until the child decides to sleep away from you <br/>\nis the<br/>\nright thing to do, I know this is true because it comes from the depth <br/>\nof my<br/>\nbeing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy babies slept with me but had cribs. I&#39;d never heard of a family bed <br/>\nuntil I started reading on these unschooling lists and message boards. <br/>\nIt may be the &quot;right&quot; thing, and I wish I had done it---but there seems <br/>\nto be no lasting damage to my darling boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when a baby cries its unmet needs should be met straight away, <br/>\nthis<br/>\nensures that the child will grow without a sense of loss and so have to <br/>\nbuy and<br/>\nsurround itself with things in a desperate need to stop the feeling of <br/>\nloss.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLate to this attachment parenting thang, but my babies cried plenty <br/>\nuntil I could meet their needs. Amazingly, they don&#39;t surround <br/>\nthemselves witth things to avoid that desperate feeling of loss. I see <br/>\nMUCH more of this behavior by children whose parents are just plain <br/>\nmean---it has nothing to do with babies&#39; cries.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that breastfeeding on demand until our children decided to stop <br/>\nis<br/>\nessential to the development of their confidence and the normal health <br/>\nof their<br/>\nbody. This too is something I know from the depth of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWould have been nice to know all this years ago. Bummer. I nursed <br/>\nCameron until he was nine months old. Duncan was a whopping four <br/>\nmonths. Again, amazingly they&#39;re VERY confident and healthy. Genetics, <br/>\nmaybe?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that constant skin or body contact for a child until it decides <br/>\nto crawl<br/>\naway is important to the well being of a child and in fact contrary to <br/>\npopular<br/>\nbelief helps the child to gain true independence. This too I know from <br/>\nthe<br/>\ndepths of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoops. No sling here. Beautiful German Kinderwagon (stroller). Both <br/>\ncrawled &quot;on time&quot; and are just as independent as they need to be. I <br/>\nthink it has more to do with attitude and kindness.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that to impose any of my flawed views of the world, much of <br/>\nwhich is<br/>\nbased on a traumatic childhood, is damaging to a child. This I know <br/>\nfrom the<br/>\ndepths of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what flawed world views you have, but I share what I know and <br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve learned. NOT sharing and them having them learn about it <br/>\nlater when it&#39;s been kept secret could possibly much more damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if my child says he is hungry thirsty scared tired lonely <br/>\nbored,<br/>\nfrightened, warm, cold, angry, sad, happy, jolly, full of fun, <br/>\ncomfortable, not<br/>\nhungry, not thirsty and just plain OK then he is right and I have no <br/>\nright to<br/>\nquestion or contradict this<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe. But some kids (and many adults) will tell you one thing when <br/>\nthey mean another. Three year olds are quite interested in doing this. <br/>\nIt&#39;s part of their learning process. It&#39;s up to us to develop the trust <br/>\nfor them to be honest with us---or even to learn to express exactly <br/>\nwhat it is they&#39;re trying to get across. Overly simple example: &quot;My <br/>\nthrooat hurts.&quot; Possible ear infection. Don&#39;t jump to conclusions <br/>\nbecause they *say* one thing. ....and always keep an extra jacket in <br/>\nthe car. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that my children&#39;s natural curiosity will led them to all sorts <br/>\nof<br/>\namazing discoveries like how to read and write and add up numbers and <br/>\ndo a<br/>\nforward roll and ride a motorbike and anything else they chose to do. I <br/>\ndo not<br/>\nhave to push cajole set work teach or inspire. They have all the wonder <br/>\nand<br/>\ndesire to explore and get to know this world of ours.

The things that are hard for me<br/>\nwill be different than the things that are hard for you, and for different<br/>\nreasons. We each have our own personal struggles with being &quot;perfect<br/>\nparents&quot; since we each have had different issues with our own parents, our<br/>\nbelief systems/religious brainwashings, societal influences, etc. In a<br/>\nmoment when you are finding it hard, I would ask yourself the question, &quot;why<br/>\ndoes this particular part of parenting bother me?&quot; and dig deep for the<br/>\nanswer. Maybe you like to be in control and giving that up to be<br/>\n&quot;subservient&quot; is hard, or maybe you were not fully loved and therefore it<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t come easily. I nursed four kids for nine years straight, much<br/>\nof the time tandem-nursing while being pregnant, and I had to work on a<br/>\ndaily basis to let go of irritability and fill myself with love. I was not<br/>\ntaken care of that way when I was little so it wasn&#39;t part of my<br/>\nconditioning, and I was charting a new course for my children. It is a brave<br/>\nand challenging thing to do! And as you obviously know, as important work as<br/>\nthere is. If there is someone you trust to work these issues out with, that<br/>\nis often helpful too. I utilize RC...re-evaluation co-counseling, which  is<br/>\na peer listening program that allows each person to simply get their<br/>\nemotions out. That allows us to think and act better. Simple, but VERY<br/>\npowerful and VERY effective. It&#39;s not always easy to figure out the &quot;why&quot; of<br/>\nhow we are, but we are in complete power to make changes by getting out the<br/>\nnegative crap. Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;2) As I know these are right am I being conceited or as I believe just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more aware than those who do not.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have conviction. I try to be careful with conviction,<br/>\nsince I have so often changed my thinking as I&#39;ve gotten older and had new<br/>\nexperiences, even the thinking that was absolute conviction. I do agree with<br/>\nmuch of what you wrote.  It reminds me of the days when my kids were younger<br/>\nand I was a fierce mama lion protecting my cubs. It is a gift to those<br/>\nlittle ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 2 questions","postDate":"1113483958","msgId":22012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS41YjQ5ZTUyMi4yZjhmYzRiNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22009,"nextInTopic":22022,"prevInTime":22011,"nextInTime":22013,"topicId":22008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"See?

Any intervention at this time stops the normal bonding and can stop that necessary flow of love. I know this because I feel it in the depths of my being and because I know the lack of connection I felt after the birth of both my boys because they were not given to me straight away. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that co-sleeping until the child decides to sleep away from you is the right thing to do, I know this is true because it comes from the depth of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when a baby cries its unmet needs should be met straight away, this ensures that the child will grow without a sense of loss and so have to buy and surround itself with things in a desperate need to stop the feeling of loss. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that breastfeeding on demand until our children decided to stop is essential to the development of their confidence and the normal health of their body. This too is something I know from the depth of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that constant skin or body contact for a child until it decides to crawl away is important to the well being of a child and in fact contrary to popular belief helps the child to gain true independence. This too I know from the depths of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that to impose any of my flawed views of the world, much of which is based on a traumatic childhood, is damaging to a child. This I know from the depths of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if my child says he is hungry thirsty scared tired lonely bored, frightened, warm, cold, angry, sad, happy, jolly, full of fun, comfortable, not hungry, not thirsty and just plain OK then he is right and I have no right to question or contradict this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that my children know what they are capable of and when they are able to do something. I know that they will ask if they need help not just in words but In signs that I must learn to detect. I know that if I am asked for that help I must ask what it is they want me to do and not do what I think they want. This I know from the depths of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that my children&#39;s natural curiosity will led them to all sorts of amazing discoveries like how to read and write and add up numbers and do a forward roll and ride a motorbike and anything else they chose to do. I do not have to push cajole set work teach or inspire. They have all the wonder and desire to explore and get to know this world of ours. I know this from the depth of my being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that all that I have stated above is right and if we are to change the world and stop the negative aspects of this world then these are the things we must awaken in the depths of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 questions are<br/>\n<br/>\n1) How come knowing these things I sometimes find it so hard to implement them. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) As I know these are right am I being conceited or as I believe just more aware than those who do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJay and Family<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooled52\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooled52</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream</a><br/>\nWhen we have children we either are woken to our past to help us heal or we are oblivious to the pain and we inflict it on our children<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nInternal Virus Database is out-of-date.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 266.9.5 - Release Date: 07/04/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22032,"nextTopicId":2929}}
