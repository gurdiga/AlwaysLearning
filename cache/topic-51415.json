A few weeks ago, my 7 year old and I were at Wal-Mart and just looking around in the toy section. She wanted to get ideas for her birthday present list to send to relatives. She saw  the Project Runway Fashion Design set and then she saw a Harumika fashion set which comes with a dress form and different fabrics. No sewing required. We went home and looked it up on Amazon and found 100&#39;s of different fun things on this subject, just type in fashion under kids, so many different things!!!. There are over 12 different computer programs, 1000&#39;s of books...endless possibilities. So she got the basic Harumika set and her older sisters(who are in different areas of the country) sent her fabric swatches and some of their clothes which she cut up and has been playing with for hours and hours. She pulled out some of her Dover coloring books on Japan and started making kimono&#39;s. She has been looking at different era&#39;s, countries and talking abut the differences(like swimsuit styles) and how they have changed. I watch, listen, interact and help by being interested and finding other resources for her to look at. She may or may not continue to be interested, but she knows if she is interested in something, there are  vast amounts of resources out there to help her learn about it. I am a single unschooling mom of 6 kids (31-8) who is on the lower economic scale, and have several years of college without a degree and still learning everyday. I have been unschooling my children since the early 80&#39;s, when I met a couple with teenagers in bookstore in California and they told me about John Holt and I immediately bought his book. I have either ran my own business(es) or as I do now,work as a Nanny/household manager (for 4 teenage boys who go to public school). I discovered this list a few years ago and felt like I finally had peers who understood me! <br/>\n<br/>\nSandieTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jparmer@...\">jparmer@...</a><br/>\nDate: Fri, 5 Mar 2010 09:37:13 -0700<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] BRAINSTORM!
