Kids don&#39;t seem interested in anything apart from saying how bored they are. They never want to go out and see anything because its too hot and sticky, they never want to go to the library. Every day is the same, staying in, playing video games and bickering. We only know 1 home-educating family in the area so they don&#39;t have any friends too see.<br/>\nFrankly, I&#39;m depressed and fed up. If I see another over-scheduling HS Soccer Mom I think I&#39;ll go nuts.<br/>\nAnyone else been through this? What did you do? And no, I can&#39;t drink or take Xanax as I&#39;m pregnant!!<br/>\n <br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
