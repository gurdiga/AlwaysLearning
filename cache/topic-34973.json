The sad","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1704864168\">My son saw a good friend recently and this boy filled him in on all of the recent events of <br/>\nhis life--a new girlfriend, and many other agenda items.  The sad thing about this, and the <br/>\nreason my son then shared them with me, is that these life events are all secrets from his <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis boy is homeschooled by what would appear to be fairly progressive parents.  They <br/>\nlived a very free life until kids turned 12, and then all of a sudden there were part time <br/>\nclasses at the charter school with homework requirements, etc.  And there were the rules:  <br/>\nnot allowed to have a girlfriend until a certain age, and many others that I don&#39;t even know <br/>\nthe details of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he breaks the rules and just doesn&#39;t tell them.  They did find out about the last <br/>\ngirlfriend, and they made him break up with her.  But now there&#39;s a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis parents mistakenly believe that they have a good and trusting relationship.  They have <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; kids and it&#39;s their duty to guide their kids and set the boundaries that will create a <br/>\nsuccessful life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I call &quot;horseshit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are deluded.  Here was my son, sharing the most intimate conversations he has with <br/>\nme, and we&#39;ve had conversations about much more intimate stuff than this, but he actually <br/>\ndoes trust me.  He thanked me for the way we live our life, and brought up some <br/>\nexamples from when he was younger about how he didn&#39;t feel he could trust me then, but <br/>\nthat that&#39;s all gone and he&#39;s so grateful to be able to just talk about anything.  (And, fyi, he <br/>\nsaid I could talk about this as long as everything was very anonymous--&#39;cause he could <br/>\nsee I was a little fired up!)  I just thought about how sad the whole thing was for their <br/>\nfamily in at least three ways:  <br/>\n<br/>\n1.  That there is a bigger and bigger gap all the time in his relationship with his parents, <br/>\nand they are getting farther and farther away from knowing their son.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2.  That the boy is completely losing out on his parents as a source of wisdom that he can <br/>\nactually access and benefit from.  He&#39;s now going to be in the position that I remember so <br/>\nclearly from my own teenagehood of trying to figure it all out for himself, with only the <br/>\nhelp of other teenagers to rely on.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The rules DON&#39;T WORK.  He, like every intelligent child ever to come before him, will <br/>\nfind ways around them if he really wants to.  And those ways will involve deception and <br/>\nmaybe just the hint of danger.  He actually admitted to not even liking the girlfriend all <br/>\nthat much, but it was fun just to have one, so he was with her anyway.  My son thought <br/>\nthat was just all wrong and didn&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents don&#39;t/can&#39;t see it, but they are driving their son away from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35038,"nextTopicId":35043}}
