I asked him tonight, what about Eli made him <br/>\nspecial?  thinking maybe I could help him find another friend like <br/>\nthat.  But, he just looked like he was going to cry and said, &quot;he is <br/>\nEli&quot;.  He says he has no other friends like him.  It breaks my heart <br/>\nthat I havnt been able to help him find other friends that he has <br/>\nthat connection with, feels that comfortable with etc.. I guess I <br/>\ndont really know what my question is.  It is just hard to see him so <br/>\nsad and I feel like I am not doing enough.  <br/>\nI will try to get in touch with Eli&#39;s mother again but havnt had much <br/>\nluck the last few times.
