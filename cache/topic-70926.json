Below is a bit of the beginning of it, and I&#39;ll bring a note when it&#39;s finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a chat in about a half an hour, on pages 198-200<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/2013/03/march-13-moments-and-mindfulness.html\">http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/2013/03/march-13-moments-and-mindfulness.html</a><br/>\nLiving in moments, rather than days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the food chat:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have priorities. A couple of times in the past someone has come and with a (suppsedly, I can&#39;t see, but it seems) straight face they ask whether two priorities can&#39;t be equal. Well.... no.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: So for this chat I&#39;m going to assume that people&#39;s priority is unschooling, natural learning, exploration, children learning in ways the parents trust but might not be able to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: If anyone&#39;s priority is political, or religious or dietary, it would be easy to argue with the idea that letting children figure out on their own which foods they want more of is incorrect, sinful, or poison.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: But having three adult children who were never once &quot;made&quot; to eat anything, and who were allowed and encouraged to try anything they thought looked good, and having followed the progress of many other families who did the same thing, I&#39;m beyond idea and theory, all the way to conviction that it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: And by &quot;works,&quot; I mean even little kids can decide that something won&#39;t be good for them because they have a cold or fever or sore throat, or that something might give them the runs (good thing to know when you are a little constipated, though, what will give your own personal body a jolt that way).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: They don&#39;t eat if they&#39;re not hungry. When they&#39;re hungry, they think about what it is they might want in ways I never could have conceived of doing when I was a kid, or their age.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70839,"nextTopicId":70928}}
