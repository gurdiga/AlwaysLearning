If not, will they strive for <br/>\nimprovement in these areas on their own given support? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose traits will develop naturally in the course of the children doing what <br/>\nthey love and from their taking advantage of natural opportunities in their <br/>\nlives.  They don&#39;t need to &quot;strive for improvement,&quot; the same way they didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to &quot;strive to learn to speak English.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best support a parent can give a child learning to speak English is to <br/>\nspeak happily of many things, to respond to his questions, to expose him to <br/>\nother uses of language (poetry, songs, plays, word games), other accents, <br/>\nfunny rhymes...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best support a teenager can get for developing as a whole person is to be <br/>\ntreated as a person with a life instead of a future-person in preparation for <br/>\na life which might begin (if he&#39;s ready) when he&#39;s 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nModelling language with proper grammar is a good way for parents to help kids <br/>\nwith grammar.<br/>\n<br/>\nModelling curiosity, joy in life, responsibility, punctuality and so forth is <br/>\nthe most support a child needs.  (Well, that and his own alarm clock, and the <br/>\nways and means to pursue the curiosity and joys.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6376,"nextTopicId":6405}}
