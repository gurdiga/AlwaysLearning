Not picking<br/>\non you, this is something I&#39;ve been thinking about.  For example, playing<br/>\nclassical music in order to &quot;enrich&quot; my child&#39;s life rather than singing<br/>\nalong with the Beattle&#39;s and telling my kids things that I know about<br/>\nthem and their music, because I&#39;m more familiar with the Beattle&#39;s than<br/>\nwith classical.  I&#39;m not sure that we can really say that one of those<br/>\nactivities would be more enriching than the other.  I do believe that<br/>\nclassical music has value and we do listen to it as well, but is it<br/>\nreally more &quot;enriching&quot; than modern popular music?  Or maybe you mean<br/>\nsomething else by that term?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling feels a little like &quot;learning how to live&quot; after<br/>\ndecades of school and paid workforce determining how I spent the majority<br/>\nof my time.

That <br/>\nis not any different than any curriculum-user or school-teacher believes. <br/>\nThey believe that kids will learn all kinds of stuff on their own when <br/>\nthey&#39;re interested, but that they need to be forced to learn some things that <br/>\nthey won&#39;t choose to learn about on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is really different than what I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst - there are going to be very cool things that they&#39;ll never learn <br/>\nanything about. That&#39;s reality. NONE of us are going to learn much about most <br/>\nstuff in the world...there is only so much time. So - another principle of <br/>\nunschooling --- &quot;There will be gaps. Let &#39;em be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - Kids want to be competent and if there are things they really do <br/>\nneed to learn, to help them join the adult world, to help them feel competent <br/>\nin their world, they will be interested EVENTUALLY.  It helps to make a list, <br/>\nfor yourself, of what you really truly think is ESSENTIAL for them to learn. <br/>\nMake the list and write a justification for everything on the list. If you <br/>\nreally do have things on that list that you really don&#39;t think your kid will <br/>\never be interested in - then I guess that&#39;s the stuff you have to insist on, <br/>\neventually. But - remember - they don&#39;t have to learn it when they&#39;re young. <br/>\nRoxana is 14 and had NO interest in math for years. None. But now she likes <br/>\nit and is learning algebra with no problem at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThird - everything is connected. An interest in musical theater can lead to <br/>\nan interest in CATS which can lead to an interest in cats (the actual <br/>\nanimals) which can lead to an interest in cat breeding which can lead to an <br/>\ninterest in genetics which can lead to an interest in DNA which can lead to <br/>\nan interest in Jurassic Park books which can lead to an interest in dinosaurs <br/>\nwhich can lead to an interest in whatever happens to come up when we go to <br/>\nthe Natural History Museum sometime in the next few weeks.  One thing leads <br/>\nto another. There is no way to plan that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There could be a *method* to making an enriched environment.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; change the basic *philosophy* of how to *use* the environment, however, <br/>\n&gt; having a method could result in having a richer environment.  Once a method <br/>\n&gt; is outlined it can be improved upon.  I think that is really what I am <br/>\n&gt; looking for.  A method or outline to an enriched environment and enriching <br/>\n&gt; experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay - a method for creating an enriched environment is to be very observant <br/>\nof and responsive to your own kids.  It means, for example, noticing that <br/>\nyour child REALLY likes to build stuff -- and providing materials for that. <br/>\nIt means learning to stay out of the way when a child is exploring and <br/>\ninvestigating and learning to step in and offer new ideas, information, or <br/>\nadvice when the time is right. It means keeping an eye out for things that <br/>\nthe kids might like to have or do or see or places to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an idea. Make an &quot;idea book&quot; yourself. Maybe a set of index cards is a <br/>\ngood way to start. You write all your ideas of cool things the kids could do <br/>\n- each on a card. You and the kids could go through the cards and pick out <br/>\ncool things to do this week or today. Let the kids make cards too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re at all imaginative, you&#39;ll need to buy your index cards at an <br/>\noffice supply warehouse store -- you&#39;ll have thousands of idea cards within a <br/>\nfew months. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling as principles to live by","postDate":"1013722675","msgId":4834,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDIxNDEzMzYwMi4wMGE2MGJkMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDljLjFhZmMxOGZiLjI5OWQ2ZDU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4833,"nextInTopic":4836,"prevInTime":4833,"nextInTime":4835,"topicId":4817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It doesn&#39;t change the basic *philosophy* of how to *use* the environment, however, having a method could result in having a richer environment.  Once a method is outlined it can be improved upon.  I think that is really what I am looking for.  A method or outline to an enriched environment and enriching experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling as principles to live by","postDate":"1013710004","msgId":4817,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxLjFiZGJmNjM3LjI5OWQ1NmI0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4824,"prevInTime":4816,"nextInTime":4818,"topicId":4817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/13/2002 11:31:56 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...

But not an educational method. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to read and think and observe (other unschoolers, yourself, your <br/>\nkids, other families, etc.) and begin to understand the principles involved <br/>\nin unschooling. And then you just live your life according to those <br/>\nprinciples. They aren&#39;t &quot;rules&quot; -- they are general principles that we live <br/>\nby.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - maybe we&#39;d be more helpful if we were more explicit about our own <br/>\nunderyling beliefs/principles:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, number one is that humans learn. (Remember the John Holt quote - Fish <br/>\nfly, etc.? ---somebody repost that, please?) <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I believe this, that humans are hardwired to be learning machines, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to worry about motivating the kids to want to learn. I just have <br/>\nto be there to provide help and support and create an enriching environment. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll take care of the learning part themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if they didn&#39;t appear to be wanting to learn stuff, what I&#39;d do is look <br/>\nfor what was BLOCKING that NATURAL aspect of their human nature. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthink I needed to make them learn. I might, however, look at my own behavior <br/>\nto see if I was doing something that they were resisting against. Or if there <br/>\nwas something else going on in their lives like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my number one principle of unschooling. A LOT flows from that one <br/>\nthing. Maybe other people could come up with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4915,"nextTopicId":4903}}
