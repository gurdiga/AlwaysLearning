I believe that Jesus is about<br/>\nas liberal as you can get.  I&#39;m pretty sure he was into &quot;judge not&quot;, and<br/>\n&quot;love one another&quot;.  I believe that the &quot;do nots&quot; of Christianity refer to<br/>\nour policing our own behavior, not the behavior of others.  I feel it is my<br/>\njob to try to make the world a warmer place for all people, not just the<br/>\nones who live like I do.  In all of the New Testament versions I have read,<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall Jesus ever judging anyone except people who set themselves up<br/>\nas &quot;religious&quot;, rather than loving, and he was definitely &quot;yoked unequally&quot;<br/>\nwhen he dealt with humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I have stopped a friendship was when the persons behavior<br/>\nimpacted me and mine.  So I have friends who are gay, friends who are<br/>\nJewish, friends who are Pagan, friends who are divorced, friends who are<br/>\nalcoholics....I even have a pen pal in prison.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very important to remember that &quot;we have all sinned and fallen<br/>\nshort of the glory of God.&quot;  I sin daily, not proud of it, but I do.  The<br/>\nprostitute&#39;s sin is no worse than mine.  The murderer&#39;s sin is no worse than<br/>\nmine.  I find it amusing that people tend to  find pardon for their own sins<br/>\nand to vilify the sins that they aren&#39;t tempted to engage in.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":837,"nextTopicId":881}}
