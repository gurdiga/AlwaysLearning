Maybe that means the oldest was in school before.  If so, she might be needier than usual.   If she wasn&#39;t in school, then I don&#39;t know that deschooling is a factor here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paragraph quoted up top seems to suggest that you think (perhaps subconsciously) that if you were NOT trying to get closer, they wouldn&#39;t be having jealousy issues.  I suppose some moms&#39; attention is so undesirable that the children prefer their siblings to receive it, but I doubt that&#39;s the way you want to go. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I want more (time and connection) with them too, but when there is lots of interruption and little willingness to work out a solution (if we are all playing), no one is able to connect.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can&#39;t change the reality of your having three children under the age of six.  I had three that way myself, years ago.   Their responsibility to work out solutions and to connect is nil.  It&#39;s yours to find creative solutions.  So it might help to word it in ways that put all the responsibility on you and your husband and not the girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":365496082,"authorName":"mbyerly77@yahoo.com","from":"&quot;mbyerly77@...&quot; &lt;mbyerly77@...&gt;","profile":"mbyerly77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Deschooling/relationships/jealousy","postDate":"1295041226","msgId":58934,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxMzkyMTk5NjQuMTkyOS4xMjk1MDQxMjI2ODIxLkphdmFNYWlsLnNldmVuQGFwMS5wMC5zamMuN3N5cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58941,"prevInTime":58933,"nextInTime":58935,"topicId":58934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are a family of 5- Mom, Dad, 3 girls ages 5, 3, and 3 months.

It helps short-term, but cannot happen everyday. Separate bedtime rituals with me seems to help too, but sometimes my husband gets home very late.  Also, I am often too tired for my 5yo by the time I finish getting my 3yo to sleep, plus the knowing of night nursing ahead of me. I realize this is unfair (to my 5yo) and not working so we are trying bedtime altogether again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel like I am missing something here. I know a lot of this is *normal*, but I want to keep building our relationships.
