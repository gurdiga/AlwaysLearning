Now, everyone had <br/>\npaid BIG bucks to be there learning about an expensive animal that they were <br/>\nall looking at purchasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were split into three groups (Ben & Barbara & I in separate groups). The <br/>\n&quot;teachers&quot; were walking us through practical things like giving shots and <br/>\ntoenail trimming, checking weight and testing fiber. When they would ask who <br/>\nwould like come up to do it themselves, NO ONE would volunteer except me! Why <br/>\nwere they there? They paid big bucks to be there and LEARN??? I did <br/>\neverything---and often more than once! I constantly asked questions and <br/>\npushed the instrustors for answers/explanantions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day we had NOT paid even bigger bucks for a prenatal and birthing <br/>\nseminar, but they offered it to all three of us for the price of one (plus a <br/>\nT-shirt that I held out for! &lt;G&gt;), because we were OBVIOUSLY serious and <br/>\ninterested and it was worth it to THEM for us to be involved!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also asked to come back up a few months later a farm-sit (and attend a <br/>\nbirth) by one of the instructors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing to me that folks will NOT do something new.
