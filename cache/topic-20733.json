I sometimes have trouble but usually I can figure it out because we are together all the time and if I can&#39;t then she describes whatever word I can&#39;t get. I have attributed a lot of this to the fact that we are multilingual at home. Even though she is not speaking French much, she hears it from her dad almost exclusively and we often play with Spanish and other languages because she&#39;s very interested in other languages. Interestingly when she says a word in French it is purely accentless but I&#39;ve had people tell me that her English sounds like has a French accent. Who knows but whatever it is I think that it may be part or why her speech development has been slower. It&#39;s fine for us but she often gets very frustrated when people don&#39;t understand her. She&#39;s never been really talkative to other people only opening up in the last year or so. When people don&#39;t understand her we&#39;ve been working towards alleviating the frustration by either me telling them what she&#39;s saying or her trying to reword it which has helped a bit. There have been a few times that it&#39;s been suggested that we should take her to a speech therapist but we believe that eventually her speech will become clearer but it will be in her time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we also skipped well baby visits. The only couple of times we went were either very traumatic (emergency room visit with the croup where we had to hold her down so they could xray her lungs - not something we wanted to repeat again) and a doc visit where he told us he thought it was something in the air making her sinusy and she was actually sick...Otherwise we didn&#39;t want her compared to some development chart to tell us she was &quot;progressing&quot; appropriately for her age. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Zurro<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=When I had my first son, almost 12 years ago I took him for all the well baby visits, and all those well baby visits did was cause me to stop nursing early, start food too early, diagnose ear infections that I doubt he ever had and cause me stress.

She joined our family when she was 5 months old. Still it appears to be common for adopted children no matter what age they come home to be &quot;delayed&quot; in some way. At 3 years old my daughter could only put 2 word sentences together. We took her for a few speech therapy sessions but it didn&#39;t jive with my unschooling philosophy so we stopped. She is now 5 and we can&#39;t get her to stop talking! lol. I would say compared to other 5 year old she still has some pronunciation issues but otherwise she talks up a storm. I think speech is one of those issue&#39;s like reading, if you child doesn&#39;t do when &quot;they&quot; say the child should be, we start to panic. But how many adults do you see walking around who cannot speak? Back in the day people just waited for their kids to start talking and they all did. There was no speech therapy back when my mom was a kid. In fact my grandmother tells a story of my uncle who didn&#39;t speak a word until he was 5.

Her Doctor addressed this as a concern at her last well baby and she was evaluated by a therapist that found her in the low end of acceptable speech, my husbands family is allways telling me to do somthing about this so called problem. Strangers allways think she is2yo. She was born with a club foot and had some physical therapy from delayed development.My child is 3 and she understands a great deal and can read some. When she speaks she uses usually uses1,2,or 3 words at a time. She seems to enjoy being quiet and will go through long sittings while reading childrens novels. We have many family members that remark about her perhaps problem. She seems so happy that it is hard for me to consider it a problem. She definitely has problems  with c&#39;s, ch&#39;s, sh&#39;s, r&#39;s, l&#39;s and s&#39;s and i think thats it, but my nephew is 5 and has problems with the same sounds and so does half the kids in his class. I am going to bring her to her well baby exam in a couple of months where it is sure to come up so i am just looking for a heads up what to expect. Kids in our area that are 3yo and have speech development are put into school earlier and everyone thinks that is so lovely but i am allready on the path of learning with her and my other child and we all really are enjoying ourselves, i dont really see how putting her in school will help, but i thats just what people usually do. When my son was her age the doctor sugjested speech therapy and early school but i just declined and he just really took off speechwise with out any ouside help, but he did not have any problems with making sounds he was just shy around strangers. I dont want to dismiss any possible genuine problems but i dont want to get caught up what people usually do because it is just how things work in the school system which we are not apart of and the medical world is not acustomed to that perhaps. I was wondering if anybody had any books to sugjest with tounge  twisters to help her work on those particular sounds. Or if their may be any genuine concerns that i can talk to the doctor about. She had her tounge clipped once to help with nursing, maybe we need to be referred to a ENT again for another tounge evaluation. Maybe some kind of massage therapy ? I know these 2 are not usually mainstream but our doctor is pretty good about giving referrals for things she would not nessisariy sugjest herself, so i am trying to find out as much as possible before our next appointment. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone shared their personal experience with this matter.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"Joanna Wilkinson","from":"&quot;Joanna Wilkinson&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling school","postDate":"1095165200","msgId":20789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNpNm9lZysxM3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTE0MDMwMzU0Ljc3MzYxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20777,"nextInTopic":63698,"prevInTime":20788,"nextInTime":20790,"topicId":20733,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
