They eat a lot more candy than they did before, but the cool thing to see is that they don&#39;t eat anything that they don&#39;t REALLY like anymore. They used to eat everything with sugar in it, but now they are finding it harder to choose when they are in the shops because there is so much they don&#39;t like anymore :) (unfortunately, there is so much to choose from, that it will take a while before they have tried everything, they have now moved from candy to cookies to cakes...).

After three months we took him out of school and decided to homeschool him. This is not an easy thing to do in the Netherlands, lots of people have to go to court because of their choice to homeschool, some even get in trouble with child protection services and in extreme cases the children are taken to foster care.

If it is up to my children, I buy a lot of candy, cakes etc. (we only lifted the food restrictions 3 weeks ago, they only eat half of it, the rest I have to throw away because it&#39;s half eaten, or my husband takes it to work and his colleagues eat it :) ).<br/>\nI try to say yes to most of their requests, but how do you handle all the requests for things when there&#39;s no money left in the bank account?<br/>\nShould I give them a fixed amount of money to spend on all the sweets they want?
