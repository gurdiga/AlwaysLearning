I tested the essential oil that is recommended for ticks, Rose<br/>\nGeranium, by putting a few drops-no more!- on our dogs&#39; collars, to see if<br/>\nit would repel ticks. Lo and behold, we went from 20 ticks a day on each<br/>\ndog, to none. The second best essential oil for repelling ticks is American<br/>\nPennyroyal (also called tickweed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple Solution:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 tablespoons vegetable or nut oil (almond oil contains sulfur, a repellent<br/>\nin its own right)<br/>\n10 to 25 drops Rose Geranium essential oil<br/>\nCombine the ingredients in a glass jar; shake to blend.<br/>\nMakes: 2 tablespoons<br/>\nShelf Life: 6 months<br/>\n<br/>\nDab a few drops on your skin or clothing, making sure to avoid eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaution<br/>\nSkip the Pennyroyal if there is anyone pregnant (including pets) in the<br/>\nhome, as it can induce miscarriage. And as always, use essential oils with<br/>\ncaution as they can burn the skin and harm eyes. Don&#39;t use these essential<br/>\noils around cats.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PS Sorry for the ramblings.
