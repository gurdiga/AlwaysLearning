It&#39;s true, for me. In the past, I used to approach my practice in a very methodical way. People talk about &quot;playing&quot; a musical instrument, but I didn&#39;t used to &quot;play&quot; with the sounds I was making. I was always worried: about tone, articulation, dynamics, tempo, and on and on. Even though I&#39;m a very playful person in some ways, I used to feel too inhibited to really &quot;play&quot; music. I didn&#39;t want to be wrong or to fail. Now, I find, more and more, I am able to improvise, to play around with sounds. I&#39;m regaining my joy, and expressing it, and sharing it. It&#39;s something I have long wished I could do, and I&#39;m so happy that I&#39;m starting to be able to now.
