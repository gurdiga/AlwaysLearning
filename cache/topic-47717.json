There&#39;s a series on pbskids.com where you can watch all sorts of things being made (plastic balls, fortune cookies, ect.,)  Max then told me he wanted to learn Spanish - so we found a Spanish alphabet and printed it - then we heard music videos of someone singing the Spanish alphabet and then played a game of his that&#39;s in Spanish.  It&#39;s amazing how kids will find their own groove if you give them the space to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFun tip:  I was recently cleaning out my making box and Max began using all the old make up I was no longer using.  He had a blast and now has a box of make-up art products - his art looked very tribal and he had so much fun sticking his fingers in funny-feeling textures.<br/>\n<br/>\nErika</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47668,"nextTopicId":47698}}
