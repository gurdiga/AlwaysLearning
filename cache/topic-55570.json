My gut instant reaction  <br/>\nin that moment is to say, &quot;wow, thanks!&quot; ... then I remember that  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a no-no for this list. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind anyone saying &quot;Wow, thanks!&quot; as long as they go on to  <br/>\nwrite things that will be beneficial to others.   &quot;Thanks&quot; can be  <br/>\nincorporated into some details or an interesting story--some specifics  <br/>\nabout why it&#39;s a &quot;wow, thanks&quot; situation.   (Not &quot;wow, thanks; I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know that; this is very interesting.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on lists where people post whole posts, with appended other  <br/>\nposts, that say &quot;OMG&quot; or WTF!? or LOL or My Dog just FARTED!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a note a bit ago that said &quot;You have created a clear, deep lake  <br/>\nof unschooling knowledge...&quot;  and that&#39;s pretty sweet.<br/>\nWhat makes it clear is that it&#39;s not muddied up with chit-chat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting to someone on the side of a list isn&#39;t about list etiquette so  <br/>\nmuch as about real-world etiquette, with an exception I&#39;ll mention in  <br/>\na minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf after someone gives a speech in public you want to sidle up to him  <br/>\nor her and shake hands and say &quot;That was a really great speech,&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m so glad you mentioned... [something specific] that&#39;s cool.    <br/>\nFollowing that same person home and threatening him is NOT at all cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn between those two are a range of possibilities.  Offering to take  <br/>\nhim for coffee; handing him a business card; introducing him to  <br/>\nfriends of yours (which he might appreciate or might be bugging him;  <br/>\ndepends, and some people can read that better than others).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome lists are just for chit chat and dog farts and recipes and &quot;So...  <br/>\nwhat are you making for dinner?&quot; kinds of conversations.   In those  <br/>\ncases, if two people disagree about something, it&#39;s accepted for the  <br/>\nlist owner to suggest that if they want to discuss that (politics/ <br/>\nreligion/ethics) they should take it off list.  It&#39;s like sending  <br/>\nteenaged boys out of of the bar if they want to fight.  It&#39;s so the  <br/>\nglassware and chairs won&#39;t get broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis particular room/list is designed for discussions of ethics and  <br/>\nprinciples, so it&#39;s more appropriate to keep the discussions of those  <br/>\nthings on the list, because others came here to read those things.    <br/>\nIf someone asks a question and one list member answers it offline  <br/>\nrather than on the list,  that&#39;s suspicious to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if someone says &quot;I&#39;m in Albuquerque, and...&quot; I&#39;m likely to write  <br/>\nand try to hook her up with something or someone local!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s quite an &quot;it depends&quot; situation.<br/>\nWill the communication be welcome?  Will it help or hurt the  <br/>\ndiscussion and purpose of the list to take the discussion away?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times in the past when the moderator of a discussion  <br/>\nlist has said &quot;you two should take this off list&quot; when someone else  <br/>\nwas being insanely abusive of me.   I had way less interest in being  <br/>\nabused and insulted in private than I did in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find out anyone has gone off list here to be abusive, I would be  <br/>\nglad to throw the abuser off the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone would mind a thank-you note.<br/>\nI also don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.
