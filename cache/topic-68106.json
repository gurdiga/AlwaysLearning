That sounds like a much more realistic barrier to unschooling than any diagnoses. Have they asked you about unschooling? Is it something they&#39;re interested in?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as unschooling and autism in general, why would unschooling a child with a diagnoses be any different than unschooling a child without one? The foundation of unschooling is to facilitate learning in ways that work for your child, that doesn&#39;t change because the child is considered by others to be non-typical. I think most unschoolers would agree that there is already no such thing as &quot;typical&quot; anyway :-) and LOTS of unschooling families would likely have children with long streams of diagnoses if their children were schooled. There is far less need to label a child who isn&#39;t being forced to fit into a system that doesn&#39;t work for him or her. I&#39;m not saying that autism isn&#39;t &quot;real,&quot; just that it doesn&#39;t effect unschooling the way it effects having to get by in a school system. With unschooling, you adapt your life so that it works with rather than against you child. Differences aren&#39;t detrimental, they&#39;re simply part of the information a parent considers when helping a child navigate the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as articles or books, I don&#39;t know what this child&#39;s diagnoses would have been had he been in school, but I think Lyla&#39;s website speaks well to the concerns you might have: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learningthroughliving.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/unschooling-the-atypical-child-by-lyla-wolfenstein/\">http://learningthroughliving.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/unschooling-the-atypical-child-by-lyla-wolfenstein/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":529085650,"authorName":"nsphotoshoot","from":"&quot;nsphotoshoot&quot; &lt;shannonpatel315@...&gt;","profile":"nsphotoshoot","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Autism and Unschooling","postDate":"1341760688","msgId":68106,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0YzhiZysyaDZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68107,"prevInTime":68105,"nextInTime":68107,"topicId":68106,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was wondering if anyone knows of an article or book written by someone who has unschooled a child with mild Autism and had success with it.
