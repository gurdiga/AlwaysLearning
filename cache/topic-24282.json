It is only in<br/>\nindustrialized Western societies such as North America and some<br/>\ncountries in Europe that sleep has become a prvite affair; the<br/>\ncomparison of the latter pattern with that of other groups highlights<br/>\none of the major ways in which the West stands out from the rest of<br/>\nhumanity in the treatment of children.  In one study of 186<br/>\nnonindustial societies, children sleep in the same bed as their<br/>\nparents in 46 percent of the nonindustrial cultures, and in a separate<br/>\nbed but in the same room in an additional 21 percent.  In other words<br/>\nin 67 percent of the cultures around the world, children sleep in the<br/>\ncompany of others.  More significant in none of those 186 cultures do<br/>\nbabies sleep in a separate place before they are at least on year old.<br/>\n In another survey of 172 societies, all infants in all cultures do<br/>\nsome co-sleeping at night, even if only for a few hours. The United<br/>\nStates consistently stands out as the only society in wihich babies<br/>\nare routinely placed in their own beds and in their own rooms; in one<br/>\nsurvey of a hundred societies, only parents in the United States<br/>\nmaintained separate quarters for their babies, and in another study of<br/>\ntwelve societies, all parents but Americans slept with their babies<br/>\nuntil weaning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Feb 3, 2006, at 9:07 AM, Andrea wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; To your benefit, remember<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that we are the only species who don&#39;t den with our family...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Recent western European culture doesn&#39;t get to define our species.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I think really it was only within the last 200 years that the  <br/>\n&gt; idea of individual rooms for children started, I think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Years ago, so I don&#39;t remember where, I visited a stately home in  <br/>\n&gt; England, somewhere south of Cambridge I think, and there was a bed  <br/>\n&gt; from the 16th century (give or take a century; I wish I really  <br/>\n&gt; remembered)  that was wide, wide--wider than two king-sized beds, and  <br/>\n&gt; the docents said they thought it was for a whole family.

The issue for you<br/>\nhusband, is it that he really would like some time with you, alone?  Is he<br/>\nfeeling like he doesn&#39;t get to be with his wife?  I notice that I can&#39;t get<br/>\nin touch with the intimate parts of me if my son is in the room.  If your<br/>\nhusband wants to connect on an intimate level (and have fun), is there a way<br/>\nyou both could leave the &quot;family den&quot; for some fun, say in the living room?<br/>\nJust a thought.  I know how hard it is for everybody&#39;s needs to be met in<br/>\nthis situation, and every family is different.  My husband has never had a<br/>\nhard time with the co-sleeping.  He has had a very big hard time, though,<br/>\nwith me being a &quot;mom&quot; 24/7&quot; and not his mate...To your benefit, remember<br/>\nthat we are the only species who don&#39;t den with our family...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all<br/>\nI haven&#39;t posted here (or anywhere) in quite a while.  I need some <br/>\nperspective.  My kids have always slept in our room.  As babies it <br/>\nwas something I insisted on, when I discovered the sleep benefits.  <br/>\nAs they grew older I tried getting them to sleep in their own rooms, <br/>\nwith the idea of &quot;that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be&quot;, not because I <br/>\nminded them in our bed.  My dh has never been thrilled with the <br/>\nidea.  He accepted the babies, because he knew it really did help me <br/>\nget more rest, but as they grew, he always made comments of them <br/>\nsleeping in their own rooms.  The kids always fought the idea and <br/>\nalways ended up in our bed sometime in the night.  My dh didn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto mind that.  He wanted them to atleast start out in their own room <br/>\nthough( alone time for us was his idea)  It was always a huge <br/>\nstruggle.  Lots of time for me getting them into bed, lots of <br/>\ngetting out of bed, being scared and eventually they would be in our <br/>\nroom anyway at some point in the night.  3 years ago, our son died.  <br/>\nFrom that point on, we all slept in one room.  My now 15 yo stopped <br/>\nafter a couple of months (she had been sleeping in her own room <br/>\nwillingly from about the age of 10-11).<br/>\nMy now 9yo son and 6yo dd don&#39;t seem to have any desire to sleep in <br/>\ntheir own rooms. They would sleep in the same room if they did go <br/>\nupstairs, so it&#39;s not a matter of being completely alone.<br/>\nI have no desire for them to leave.  My dh isn&#39;t home at night <br/>\nusually 3 nights of the week til about 2 a.m.  In the summer it&#39;s 6 <br/>\nnights a week.  We just downsized to a queen(it was free and our <br/>\nking was really bad) and the kids sleep on cushions on the floor <br/>\nnext to the bed.  I thought this would make dh happier because he <br/>\natleast isn&#39;t crowded out of the bed anymore.  But it still is <br/>\nbothering him.  He usually doesn&#39;t make a big deal.  Just snide <br/>\ncomments here and there.  But every once in a while he has a fit <br/>\nabout it in front of the kids and is mad that I&#39;m not backing him <br/>\nup.  I remain calm and do see his side, but I also feel I &#39;m the one <br/>\nthat really has to make the effort and it seems futile anyway.  And <br/>\nit&#39;s not something I want to do.  He&#39;s not willing to really go <br/>\nthrough the process of putting them to be.  He thinks they should be <br/>\nsent to bed and stay there, like he did as a child (or atleast <br/>\nthat&#39;s what he wishes could happen).  That never worked in the past, <br/>\nbut he doesn&#39;t want to hear logic or opinions, he just wants it to <br/>\nbe easy and done.<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking I should just take a stand here.  Usually it blows <br/>\nover, sometimes I make a little effort but end up back to our usual, <br/>\nall going to sleep in my bed together, he accepts it&#39;s not happening <br/>\nand we continue to all sleep in the room.  <br/>\nI&#39;m thinking they will naturally want to sleep in their own rooms at <br/>\nsome point (like my oldest did)  My 9yo seems to want to, but gets <br/>\nscared being alone still.  My 6 yo has no desire.<br/>\nAlso, my oldest went to high school and goes to sleep earlier than <br/>\neveryone else.  The kids rooms are upstairs and they would keep her <br/>\nawake if they were up there.<br/>\nI make an effort for dh and I to have &quot;alone time&quot; at other times <br/>\nthan night.  Dh usually sleeps in late and we can have &quot;alone time&quot; <br/>\nmid morning while the kids are busy doing thier own things, so I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t think that should be an issue with him.  I&#39;m way to <br/>\ntired at night usually, anyway. (Especially if I&#39;ve just spent a lot <br/>\nof energy getting the kids in their own rooms.)<br/>\nSo am I being wrong or stubborn or lazy or a clingy mother here?<br/>\nShould I put his wants over ours?  How can I do that without being <br/>\nresentful.<br/>\nShould i ask him to accept this and realize it is temporary (though <br/>\nnot short term)<br/>\nI would really like to let the kids choose when they are ready.  I <br/>\nwould like them to feel completely welcome by both of us.<br/>\nI think I should really take a stand here, but wanted some <br/>\nperspective first.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24269,"nextTopicId":24299}}
