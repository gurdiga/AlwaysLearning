Sad though it isn&#39;t in its<br/>\ncountries of origin providing some perspective on history for the Cultures<br/>\nwho produced it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did feel odd though that the science and technology and knowledge the<br/>\nMuslims were discovering was at a time when the European Christians were<br/>\nburning witches for using herbal cures, given the whole Christian debate on<br/>\nthis list;)  Funny how history progresses.  I remember being surprised to<br/>\nread at some point as a teen that the Muslims were using science at a time<br/>\nwhen the Christians were putting ashes on their foreheads, and casting<br/>\ndemons to cure the sick.  We get so much from that area of  the world, even<br/>\nthe Greek philosophers/scientists(Euclid&#39;s elements tablet for sale on the<br/>\nsite) got &#39;rediscovered&#39; through the Muslim libraries.  I don&#39;t understand<br/>\nthe development of gender politics there though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when reading about menstruation in Muslim culture seeing two<br/>\npossible interpretations explained:  one contention was that there was a<br/>\nmistranslation from older transcripts that claimed menstruating women needed<br/>\nto be excused to rest as they were vulnerable during this time, and the<br/>\nother contention was that menstruating women were sick/unclean and society<br/>\nneeded to be protected from them.
