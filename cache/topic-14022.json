Yesterday, we went to visit and see the baby.  Their oldest dd  is <br/>\n6, next is 3.  Neither sister likes or is excited about the baby. And my <br/>\nneighbor said they are trying not to hold the baby too much because the <br/>\nother girls get jealous.  It&#39;s so hard for me to keep my mouth shut <br/>\nsometimes, but I did.  How sad for that baby and for the older girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve always included my girls in my pregnancy, home birth, <br/>\nbreastfeeding, all of it.  I always told them that it was &quot;our&quot; baby. <br/>\n The day after my 4th dd was born, the 2 yr old sat and held her on the <br/>\ncouch for almost 2 hrs.  When the 2 yr old was born, my 5 yr old (2 at <br/>\nthe time) held her for the first time and wouldn&#39;t give her back.  The <br/>\nsame when the second was born and my first tried to nurse her so she <br/>\ncould be her mommy, too.  It&#39;s been 5 months now and they still fight <br/>\nover who&#39;s turn it  is to hold our newest.  Some might think I&#39;m just <br/>\nlucky that they all like each other, but I think the parents need to let <br/>\nthe older children know how important they are to a new siblings life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are right next door to each other, us with four girls 7,5,2 1/2, and <br/>\n5 mnths, and them with three girls, 6, 3, and 2 days.  And I don&#39;t like <br/>\nmy girls to play with theirs too much.  The 6 year old is violent. <br/>\n Every summer they take her out into the woods and catch big toads and <br/>\nlet her take them home.  She kills them within one day.  Swings them by <br/>\nthe legs, throws them in the air.  Last summer I called my girls to come <br/>\nhome when she did this and explained to them that the frog was alive and <br/>\ncould feel pain and what that little girl was doing was cruel.  Then <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t go back over.  They wanted me to make her stop, but her <br/>\nmother was right there and she wasn&#39;t saying anything.  I didn&#39;t feel it <br/>\nwas my place, although maybe I should have.  And the 3 yr old is <br/>\npainfully shy and hardly ever even outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I&#39;m just rambling.  I feel so sad for those girls because <br/>\nchildren need touching and affection. All the toads and toys (which they <br/>\nhave tons) in the world won&#39;t make up for the simplest and most basic <br/>\nneed they have, the love of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to go hug my girls now.  Have a great day, everyone!   HeidiC.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13979,"nextTopicId":14035}}
