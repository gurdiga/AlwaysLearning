I Do see the  <br/>\nproblem with it.    I thought someone here might remember where, as it  <br/>\nwas only last year.   Here&#39;s what&#39;s on my page:<br/>\n<br/>\nRECENT QUESTION AND COMMENT<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone wrote to me: &quot;Iâ€™m starting to see why you admire John Holt.  <br/>\nWill you tell me more about him?&quot;<br/>\nI responded:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I admire his courage and his writings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He had oddnesses, and I don&#39;t admire him so much as a human. He  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t married. He didn&#39;t have kids. What he learned he learned from  <br/>\nother people&#39;s kids in classrooms and when visiting in their homes,  <br/>\nand he was SO interested in kids that their lives were different just  <br/>\nfor his being there, so what he saw often was how a child is in the  <br/>\npresence of a really interested and interesting adult. That&#39;s the part  <br/>\nI want to emulate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause John Holt was SO interested in children, every time he  <br/>\ninteracted with one, he saw a child interacting with a fascinated  <br/>\nadult. THIS is one of the things unschoolers need to remember. When  <br/>\nthe adult brings boredom, cynicism, criticism and doubt to the table,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s what he&#39;ll see and that&#39;s how he&#39;ll see it, and it will be no  <br/>\nfault of the child&#39;s whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith your happiest, most open mind, read what John Holt wrote years  <br/>\nago and leave this place stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd, Februrary 2008</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46955,"nextTopicId":13346}}
