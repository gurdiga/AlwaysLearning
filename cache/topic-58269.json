In a way, trolls are amazingly unintentionally<br/>\ninsightful and inciteful. Oh my god! Instead of being bound within the<br/>\ncovers of books and the confines of school, there it is: instructions and<br/>\ndirections and arrows point to all sorts of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about the sign that says &quot;This way to Toledo&quot; and at the end of the<br/>\narrow there&#39;s a huge truck in the way from the viewer&#39;s vantage point? Is<br/>\nthe viewer seeing in two dimensions or three (or more)? Or how about<br/>\nhandmaking the binding and covering of a book rather than limiting oneself<br/>\nto the reading of the pages within? Or writing (or re-writing) the story<br/>\nyourself? Or how about reading between the lines? I like all of those. I am<br/>\na book or perhaps I am a whole library of the things.
