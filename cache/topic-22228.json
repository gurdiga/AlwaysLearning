Something tells me that it&#39;s not a  <br/>\nsmall fair.  Each child spends approximately 3-5 mins. with the judge  <br/>\n(there are multiple judges in each department) talking about their  <br/>\nproject.  We don&#39;t have different age-levels that I&#39;m aware of,  <br/>\nexcept Clover Kids and 4H kids. Clover Kids get just a &quot;participation  <br/>\nribbon&quot; no matter what they do. I think this is dandy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ve gotten blue, red, and white ribbons, in the past, and they<br/>\n&gt; pretty much all seemed like reasonable results - blue for the projects<br/>\n&gt; that they did the most work on, red for the ones that they&#39;d worked<br/>\n&gt; less on, and white for the ones they threw together and didn&#39;t care as<br/>\n&gt; much about. You have to sign up and say what you&#39;re going to submit,<br/>\n&gt; months ahead - and sometimes they didn&#39;t have nearly as much interest<br/>\n&gt; when the time came as they thought they would.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;m no fair expert but our first experience with our club in which  <br/>\nall of our members were first-timers, was very different.  In our  <br/>\ncounty, you have to sign up by July 1 and the fair takes place the  <br/>\nthird week in July.  Most of our kids put their exhibits together in- <br/>\nbetween those dates.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The judges sheets are returned to the kids later - and mine have<br/>\n&gt; learned from those. They really like the feedback.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nDs doesn&#39;t take criticism well, constructive or not.  He really has  <br/>\nno interest in a stranger&#39;s opinions of his thoughts, efforts or  <br/>\nproducts and often has very little interest in my criticism.  He  <br/>\nrealized before he met with the judge that he&#39;d made an error in the  <br/>\namount of tapioca he&#39;d put in and he told the judge.  When she cut  <br/>\ninto the pie, she commented on it&#39;s runniness as it&#39;s only problem.  <br/>\nShe gave him strokes for what little effort he did put into it but  <br/>\nremember, he was there under pressure from me so whatever she had to  <br/>\nsay about his project was not important to him.  He thought it was  <br/>\nall pretty lame. He was almost ashamed that he got the blue ribbon.   <br/>\nHe knew that the pie could&#39;ve been better if not for the simple  <br/>\ntapioca error. He didn&#39;t think it deserved a blue ribbon. The fact  <br/>\nthat she gave him a blue ribbon just made him think that it was given  <br/>\nfreely and without serious consideration of the quality of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;d submit their stuff even if it wasn&#39;t being judged, though.  <br/>\n&gt; It is<br/>\n&gt; the FUN of participating in that huge big splendid cornucopia of<br/>\n&gt; interesting displays that motivates them, not getting a ribbon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Too bad about a kid never wanting to do it again because OTHER kids  <br/>\n&gt; got<br/>\n&gt; blue ribbons, though. That&#39;s a misunderstanding of the point of the<br/>\n&gt; whole thing, I think. It is putting far too much focus on the judging<br/>\n&gt; and ribbons and not on the joy and learning itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really did not mean to say that he didn&#39;t want to do it again  <br/>\nbecause OTHER kids got blue ribbons!  He, in fact, was quite proud of  <br/>\nthe accomplishments of his clubmates. He is probably their biggest  <br/>\ncheerleader but he has no interest in participating in that aspect of  <br/>\nthe fair for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll bake a pie again, mostly because he loves to eat it! &lt;g&gt; He&#39;ll  <br/>\nbake a pie again because his family thinks that he bakes really yummy  <br/>\npies and he enjoys our enjoyment of his pies. He won&#39;t ever bake a  <br/>\npie to find out what some &quot;expert&quot; thinks of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A couple of kids I know do a lot of sewing. They sew because they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; loving to learn how - to make their own clothes - to WEAR the things<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve made for themselves or see others wear things they&#39;ve made for<br/>\n&gt; them. When fair time comes and they choose a couple of things to  <br/>\n&gt; submit<br/>\n&gt; for display, I&#39;m sure they hope to score well, but really it is such a<br/>\n&gt; tiny part of their participation in the whole program, it isn&#39;t a big<br/>\n&gt; deal at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Same for those who grow vegetables and pick some to display. Same for<br/>\n&gt; those who raise animals. Same for those who learn cake decorating.  <br/>\n&gt; Same<br/>\n&gt; for the photography project. The focus of their year is not on winning<br/>\n&gt; something at the fair - it is on the learning and fun and comradeship<br/>\n&gt; with others who have similar interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nDs is a pretty strong introvert.  He prefers to spend the majority of  <br/>\nhis time in quiet solitude reading books, playing RPG video games and  <br/>\ndesigning  new RPG games to play with his few close friends.  He gets  <br/>\ngreat satisfaction from working in the 4H garden raising produce to  <br/>\ndonate to the local soup kitchens and food pantries. He takes his  <br/>\nrole as vice-president fairly seriously and gently keeps a couple of  <br/>\nthe younger members on task during our business meetings. He works  <br/>\nhard to contribute &quot;miles&quot; for our club fitness team that is  <br/>\ncompeting in a statewide physical fitness program. He also encourages  <br/>\nclub members to contribute ideas for recreation activities and give  <br/>\npresentations. During the fair he will help &quot;host&quot; the 4H building  <br/>\nwith his club mates.  He&#39;ll help decorate the club booth.  He&#39;ll even  <br/>\nenjoy browsing all of the exhibits.  BUT, he has absolutely no  <br/>\ninterest in doing 4H &quot;projects&quot; or submitting anything in the fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The 4H building at the fair is really such a wonderful thing - I LOVE<br/>\n&gt; seeing all those blue ribbons!

About a pie?? <br/>\nIt sounds like a very small fair - there is no way ours would have time <br/>\nto &quot;conference&quot; with anybody - they&#39;d have 50 or 100 or more kids to <br/>\nconference with for each of maybe a hundred or more entry categories at <br/>\neach age level. Wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my kids have things to enter into the fair this year - both are <br/>\nsubmitting short stories. They really LIKE to have chances to have <br/>\nthings they&#39;ve produced be on display to the public. Show-offs, I guess <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; -- but, when you write something, you want people to read it - I <br/>\nmean, that IS the purpose. And the same thing with other projects <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had in the fair, in the past. It is great fun to go into the <br/>\nyouth exhibit hall and see their own display there and all the people <br/>\nwalking around looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve gotten blue, red, and white ribbons, in the past, and they <br/>\npretty much all seemed like reasonable results - blue for the projects <br/>\nthat they did the most work on, red for the ones that they&#39;d worked <br/>\nless on, and white for the ones they threw together and didn&#39;t care as <br/>\nmuch about. You have to sign up and say what you&#39;re going to submit, <br/>\nmonths ahead - and sometimes they didn&#39;t have nearly as much interest <br/>\nwhen the time came as they thought they would.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe judges sheets are returned to the kids later - and mine have <br/>\nlearned from those. They really like the feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;d submit their stuff even if it wasn&#39;t being judged, though. It is <br/>\nthe FUN of participating in that huge big splendid cornucopia of <br/>\ninteresting displays that motivates them, not getting a ribbon.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad about a kid never wanting to do it again because OTHER kids got <br/>\nblue ribbons, though. That&#39;s a misunderstanding of the point of the <br/>\nwhole thing, I think. It is putting far too much focus on the judging <br/>\nand ribbons and not on the joy and learning itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of kids I know do a lot of sewing. They sew because they&#39;re <br/>\nloving to learn how - to make their own clothes - to WEAR the things <br/>\nthey&#39;ve made for themselves or see others wear things they&#39;ve made for <br/>\nthem. When fair time comes and they choose a couple of things to submit <br/>\nfor display, I&#39;m sure they hope to score well, but really it is such a <br/>\ntiny part of their participation in the whole program, it isn&#39;t a big <br/>\ndeal at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame for those who grow vegetables and pick some to display. Same for <br/>\nthose who raise animals. Same for those who learn cake decorating. Same <br/>\nfor the photography project. The focus of their year is not on winning <br/>\nsomething at the fair - it is on the learning and fun and comradeship <br/>\nwith others who have similar interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 4H building at the fair is really such a wonderful thing - I LOVE <br/>\nseeing all those blue ribbons!

But <br/>\nphilosophically, they still need to be prepared to deal with the  subjective reality <br/>\nof ANY judging no matter HOW &quot;fair&quot; the rules have been  tweaked to be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have years and years of experience trying to help people make rules for  <br/>\narts and sciences competitions fairer (local, principality, kingdom level in the <br/>\n SCA), and more years trying to talk them out of having the competitions at  <br/>\nall.    It seems there are always people at all stages of desire  and <br/>\nunderstanding for competitions.  In a fixed-size group (or anywhere  where the people <br/>\nknow who&#39;s also NOT in the competition) you get a larger level  of comparison <br/>\nand &quot;value&quot; to prizes and honors and &quot;winner&quot; titles.  I  think we tried every <br/>\npossible way on earth.  And some people were happy  each time and others were <br/>\nin tears.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAn aside for those who are in the SCA, in the more specific parlance of  that <br/>\ngroup:  I&#39;ve been a Laurel for over 20 years and Mistress of the  Pelican for <br/>\ntwo or  three years longer than that.  I was a chronicler  and seneschal.  I <br/>\nwas involved in these rules changes at the publication,  approval, writing, <br/>\ncritiquing and implementation level.  Then at the  debrief and social-clean-up <br/>\nedge again.  It never was worth it to choose an  &quot;arts champion,&quot; and as a <br/>\nLaurel I was looking for artists who were doing things  for real uses, not for <br/>\ncompetitions and displays.  And the competitions and  displays themselves are the <br/>\nantithesis of what club members should&#39;ve been doing  with time, energy, <br/>\nsites and events.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat helped more than anything--in, during and after all that--was to help  <br/>\npeople understand that all judging is subjective, nobody (not even them) could  <br/>\nBE objective, and that they don&#39;t have to enter.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI also designed and saved what seemed to be the fairest judging method I&#39;d  <br/>\never seen.

I believe you Pam but<br/>\n  I&#39;ll be a little more specific about what I found out.  Under the &quot;4H<br/>\n  Exhibit Building Division&quot; instructions in our County Fair booklet<br/>\n  the 4th item says,<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;GOALS: Exhibitor must answer the following questions about the exhibit:<br/>\n  1) What was your exhibit goal(s)?<br/>\n  2) How did you go about working toward your goal(s)?<br/>\n  3) What were the most important things you learned as you worked<br/>\n  toward your goal(s)?<br/>\n  4) What would you like to do in this project area next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Failure to attach the responses to these statements will result in a<br/>\n  lower ribbon rating.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the exhibitor did the above and properly labeled their exhibit<br/>\n  they were awarded a blue ribbon regardless of the effort put into<br/>\n  the exhibit or answering the questions. Needless to say, my son did<br/>\n  not feel that the effort, or lack thereof, that was put into the<br/>\n  exhibit nor the quality of the end product was even considered in the<br/>\n  ribbon award he received.  Maybe he had a goofy judge but as we sat<br/>\n  their waiting for his turn to conference with the judge we saw so<br/>\n  many blue ribbons floating about that it seemed meaningless. Every<br/>\n  one of our club members that exhibited received at least a blue ribbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We did have two club members&#39; exhibits selected for higher awards.<br/>\n  One of our youngest members had a  notebook about his dog, for which<br/>\n  he received a LOT of assistance from his parents in putting<br/>\n  together.  He was awarded a gold ribbon but his age prevented him<br/>\n  from being able to enter it in the State Fair.  Another older member<br/>\n  had a very well designed and put together notebook about the history<br/>\n  and cultural significance of a Sari and illustrated how to wear one.<br/>\n  She received a Purple ribbon and got to exhibit in the State Fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I just don&#39;t get the value in the whole process of grading<br/>\n  and ribbon awarding for 4H projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Chris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Jun 10, 2005, at 5:38 PM, Pam Sorooshian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;  There are specific things judges are looking for - they<br/>\n  &gt; have scoring sheets to work from.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; In addition, very often, a gold medal is also given - this is the<br/>\n  &gt; first<br/>\n  &gt; place winner.

(&quot;The same&quot; in what way?&quot;  That&#39;s the hard question.  &lt;g&gt;)  Is <br/>\nprison art as valuable as similar art made by someone who  had the freedom to <br/>\njump up and go do something else?   Is the carving  kids did on desks as &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nas the carving my husband does on wood?<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly used to draw on her pants, and did some really cool stuff, so I&#39;m not  <br/>\nsuggesting all pants-drawing is school-prison art, just discussing what <br/>\n&quot;value&quot;  is in the value of grades.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne reason I didn&#39;t want to teach anymore (there were several) was that the  <br/>\npay scale was such that it didn&#39;t matter how one worked, just so one showed  <br/>\nup.  So in effect, all the teachers were &quot;making A&#39;s&quot; (or probably making  C&#39;s) <br/>\nregardless of how or whether they taught or inspired.  So motivation  was <br/>\nzilch.  More than that, it was to the lazy and burned  out teachers&#39; advantage to <br/>\ndiscourage spark and creativity in other newer  or more energetic teachers.  <br/>\nIn the same way kids are like to say to kids  at school &quot;That&#39; stupid, why are <br/>\nyou doing that?&quot; rather than &quot;how cool!&quot;   it&#39;s pretty often the same with <br/>\nteachers to other teachers.     The lowest common denominator thinking can ooze <br/>\ninto all the cracks.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo nowadays (past my teaching days) it does seem that test scores are the  <br/>\nonly goal for the school as a whole (they still need some star students to point <br/>\n at to give parents hope and shame the other kids, but they only need a  <br/>\nfew).  I&#39;m guessing that there are instances in which creativity has been  <br/>\noutright banned and shunned, because it doesn&#39;t produce points on tests within  nine <br/>\nmonths.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat&#39;s wonderful about unschooling is that in the absence of semesters and  <br/>\nschoolyears, it&#39;s just fine if our &quot;results&quot; are fifteen years out, or thirty  <br/>\nyears out.   There will be moments when my kids are no kids, when  they&#39;re 35 <br/>\nand 42 and 50, that something they did, heard or saw in these days  kicks in.  <br/>\nAnd it will be &quot;Cool!&quot; not &quot;DOH! It&#39;s too late now!   Why didn&#39;t I think of <br/>\nthis when it mattered, so I could earn school-points with  it?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere were tests done by school reform researchers in the 60&#39;s that showed  <br/>\nthat in the total absence of grades, kids knew which of the other kids were <br/>\nbest  and worst at which subject areas. They could rank themselves and each other <br/>\nas  well as or probably better than any standardized tests.    In  another <br/>\nstudy (reproducible, but how cruel), teachers were given new classes of  kids <br/>\nand false test scores.  Believing these numbers really showed the  kids&#39; <br/>\npotential, the teachers paid more attention to the higher-scored kids  (though the <br/>\nscores were false) than to the lower scores.  But was it just  purely that, or <br/>\nwas it that they knew they were being observed as teachers and  were doing what <br/>\nthey thought the researchers wanted them to do?  And, it  turns out, that WAS <br/>\nwhat the researchers wanted.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s way more complex than it would seem if we talked about it for a  year.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was doing show and tell one year with 7th graders (12 years old, give or  <br/>\ntake, for the benefit of Brits and Holly).  My intent was to give them  chances <br/>\nto speak aloud, and to share personal stories or hobbies or  skills.  Some <br/>\ndid bring something cool, and it was fine if they were really  creative with <br/>\nsomething casual or mundane, like &quot;This chapstick has been in my  coat pocket <br/>\nsince last year, and I didn&#39;t know where it was...&quot;  but  one incident  <br/>\nfrustrated lots of people.  A kid who hadn&#39;t  prepared pulled out his ballpoint pen and <br/>\nshowed us.  Lame.  But two  OTHER kids then did the same thing, and didn&#39;t <br/>\nsay anything more interesting  than &quot;this is my pen.&quot;  The whole game was over.  <br/>\n How, in such a  situation, can the really sparkly ones be rewarded if the <br/>\nonly scrip we have for  payment is literally scrip: letters on paper that they <br/>\ncan cash in elsewhere or  use to get more scrip.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t affect unschoolers except in the further thinking of the  <br/>\nparents.  When you think back on your own schooling, try to think of it  from <br/>\nothers&#39; point of view who were involved too.  When you look at your  kids it&#39;s fine <br/>\nto think &quot;They won&#39;t have to mess with grades,&quot; but when they&#39;re  older they <br/>\nwill mess with SOME form of reward and comparison.  Kirby was  frustrated when <br/>\ntemporary hires made as much as he made at special events the  store put on.  <br/>\nI was crushed when he got a D on a test in the first English  class he took.  <br/>\n(He seemed not to be.)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not just a matter of being competitive.  Even a non-competitive  person <br/>\ncan being to feel discomfort from the &quot;life&#39;s not fair&quot; factor.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":189611316,"authorName":"huntmom1996","from":"&quot;huntmom1996&quot; &lt;jechunt@...&gt;","profile":"huntmom1996","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: giving grades","postDate":"1118232793","msgId":22282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ4Nm5jcCtuZG0yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHSUVOQkRGQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":22261,"nextInTopic":22283,"prevInTime":22281,"nextInTime":22283,"topicId":22228,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mara wrote: ** There is one public school in my area that moved away from grades in the lower elementary grades, but other than that, I ve only heard of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-357189336\">Mara wrote:  <br/>\n** There is one public school in my area that moved away from grades <br/>\nin the lower elementary grades, but other than that, I&#39;ve only heard <br/>\nof private schools where this was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any experience with college teaching without grades <br/>\nin a school where grades are used?***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe public school system ny daughter was in didn&#39;t give grades at all <br/>\nuntil 6th grade, just narrative, paragraph long assessments on each <br/>\nsubject.

A teacher<br/>\nshould be able to give an experience, to share their expertise, and leave it<br/>\nat that. Their supervisor&#39;s judgment of the teacher should come from the<br/>\nstudents&#39; feedback. After all, they are the &quot;customers&quot;. If one is seeking<br/>\nto learn a subject and they take a course, they will know what they learned,<br/>\nand how effective it was for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly is EASIER to reduce a person&#39;s work to a single letter, but I<br/>\nthink it is much more effective to communicate in more detail about what<br/>\nworks, what needs work, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m talking about a children&#39;s school situation here, not a specialized<br/>\nadult course (though as an adult I would prefer the honest, intelligent<br/>\ncommunication over the grade too :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;People don&#39;t get paid (and students don&#39;t pay) for a person to say<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;whatever&quot; all the time or &quot;cool!&quot; whether it&#39;s crap or golden.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is completely possible to communicate intelligently about a<br/>\nperson&#39;s work without grading and have it be much more effective than<br/>\n&quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;. I agree that a teacher is being employed with the goal<br/>\nof the student to learn something, and that can happen through good<br/>\ncommunication.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Or an orchestra conductor who has to  decide<br/>\n&gt;&gt;who&#39;s first chair.

Doing this in the<br/>\nfalse reality of school makes no sense to me (i.e. comparing one child&#39;s<br/>\nwork with another&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also was a teacher from 1986 to 2000 in different capacities and never<br/>\nmarked a single grade for a student.
