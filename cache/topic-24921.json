DH <br/>\nthought it was a great idea, and installed it on all the computers in the <br/>\nhouse.  I think that lasted about oh, 3 days.  Then he uninstalled <br/>\nit.

That is just the reason that I don&#39;t think I could<br/>\never bring myself to do an interview on Unschooling for the mainstream<br/>\nmedia.  As much as I&#39;d like to share about our cool Unschooling life, I just<br/>\nworry that I&#39;d be portrayed as a nut or put on the spot so that I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nsay what I had planned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s awesome that you felt comfortable enough to do it but I am<br/>\nsorry that it wasn&#39;t a more positive experience.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a learning experience for you both though.  Makes you question<br/>\neverything else that is on the news though, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Gail&#39;s experiences with FOX news","postDate":"1143398315","msgId":24921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFMjU2NzYzLUEyMkMtNDI3Qy04OTQyLTdEOUQ0QUU1ODVDRkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24922,"prevInTime":24920,"nextInTime":24922,"topicId":24921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I asked Gail if I could share what she sent when they got home.

I actually considered writing it to the whole  <br/>\nlist because I&#39;d seen your post about it.

I  <br/>\nwish it would have been even a little bit positive about unschooling  <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t think it was.  Mainstream journalism and especially a  <br/>\nstation like Fox is just not going to present us in a positive  <br/>\nlight........yet..&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GailBrocOP@...\">GailBrocOP@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: March 25, 2006 6:45:50 PM MST<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: fox news interview<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Sandra,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to put a positive slant to  <br/>\n&gt; this....but even after decompressing for several hours am just not  <br/>\n&gt; going to be able to do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay.....the limo ride...that was fairly cool...&lt;g&gt;  Nice driver.   <br/>\n&gt; End of the positive part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We got there and were told it would be live.  They showed us where  <br/>\n&gt; we would sit, how the microphone would work and the earpieces.  No  <br/>\n&gt; one at the studio knew what the story was about or who would be  <br/>\n&gt; asking us questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About 5 minutes prior, they sat us in the chairs, put on the wires,  <br/>\n&gt; powdered our faces and told us to look at the camera when we  <br/>\n&gt; talked.  Brenna was about ready to throw up...and we sat there and  <br/>\n&gt; waited and waited and waited.  We could hear Fox News in our  <br/>\n&gt; earpieces with stories of the wife shooting the minister husband  <br/>\n&gt; with occasionally references that said...&quot;It would be some parent&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; idea of a nightmare if your children could study anything they  <br/>\n&gt; wanted to study...stay tuned for our story on unschooling...&quot;  The  <br/>\n&gt; lights were blinding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The anchor introduced the story saying &quot;What would kids do if they  <br/>\n&gt; had control over what they learned?  It&#39;s a frightening thought for  <br/>\n&gt; any parent&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They asked me about unschooling.  I think I made two points just as  <br/>\n&gt; Pam had suggested although the feedback from the earpiece made it  <br/>\n&gt; very difficult.  I said something like &quot;Unschooling has meant  <br/>\n&gt; providing a rich trusting environment where my children could  <br/>\n&gt; explore their interests. That was as much time as they gave before  <br/>\n&gt; another question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next....&quot;Is it like Montesorri school for teens or does she have  <br/>\n&gt; they opportunity to not work at all?&quot;..and they put Brenna&#39;s name  <br/>\n&gt; in there quietly but I didn&#39;t hear and responded thinking the  <br/>\n&gt; interview would last at least more than 60 seconds.  While I was  <br/>\n&gt; answering they were panning to pictures of kids in schools.  I  <br/>\n&gt; think I said something fairly articulate but at that point I  <br/>\n&gt; realized that it really didn&#39;t matter what I said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then they went to Melissa Walker who said some inane thing about  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;What if in exploring your passions your missed out on a class in  <br/>\n&gt; history where they were discussing Roe v Wade and that could have  <br/>\n&gt; led to an interest in law?&quot;   WHAT????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then a Dean of Admissions from Barnard said something about there  <br/>\n&gt; was no way to test the preparedness of an unschooled student and  <br/>\n&gt; that students who followed no structured path are at a huge  <br/>\n&gt; disadvantage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then there was a breaking news story about 7 people shot in Seattle  <br/>\n&gt; and that was the end. No chance for any responses  I&#39;d estimate the  <br/>\n&gt; total time on air to be maybe 2 minutes.  It was a 40 minute drive  <br/>\n&gt; each way to get there and back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, Brenna didn&#39;t get to say anything and she had these really cool  <br/>\n&gt; things to say about her life.. and if she wanted to go to college  <br/>\n&gt; or even get into Barnard (although it wasn&#39;t high on her list)   <br/>\n&gt; that she had complete confidence that she could do it. We  really  <br/>\n&gt; wanted to ask if the Dean had known any unschoolers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So then, we came home...same nice limo driver.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We made about a pact....no more Elle Girl Articles.....no more Fox  <br/>\n&gt; TV news interviews....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not an especially positive experience.....but certainly an  <br/>\n&gt; experience.  Newt Gingrich had been there the day before and the  <br/>\n&gt; studio people said he needed a lot of make up..&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well....Logan said probably only 5 people were watching on a  <br/>\n&gt; Saturday afternoon and maybe no one we knew.  He&#39;s our biggest fan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brenna decided she hasn&#39;t had enough stress for one weekend and  is  <br/>\n&gt; auditioning for a role in a community theatre production of &quot;A  <br/>\n&gt; Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; tomorrow.  She thinks  <br/>\n&gt; she can get a part as a courtesan....that might be more fun than  <br/>\n&gt; our interview.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello to everyone there..  We could use a game of Encore tonight!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25020,"nextTopicId":25033}}
