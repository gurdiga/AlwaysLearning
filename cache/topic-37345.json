It may look like, walk like and act like dislike, but<br/>\nlike/dislike is a moot point to consider because if the philosophy were to<br/>\nchange to agreement on either side, then the tone of the relationships would<br/>\nalso change.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe more if Trai is very obedient and works hard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enough for some free time.

I am overwhelmed that anyone would take the time to <br/>\ntalk to me about our situation.  I have been so encouraged and <br/>\nempowered by all your advice.  I haven&#39;t felt so supported since, <br/>\nwell, ever.  Here in the southeast the general attitude toward <br/>\nchildren is that they belong to their parents in a way similar to <br/>\nowning pets or property and are supposed to blindly obey their <br/>\nparents to the letter.  Period.  No questions asked.  And if they <br/>\ndelay for a moment, that is considered disobedience, because it makes <br/>\nthe parents have to repeat themselves, which means the child didn&#39;t <br/>\ndo what &quot;it&quot; was told in the first place.  Just hearing your replies <br/>\nto me and to the mom who thought I was wrong to support my daughter <br/>\nand her boyfriend has helped me more than I can even say.  You <br/>\nreminded me that I count too and so does Rachel.  I&#39;m morphing back <br/>\ninto myself slowly but surely.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTo update you on Rachel and Trai&#39;s situation:  <br/>\nNot much has changed for Trai, but Rachel has decided to start being <br/>\nless available to Trai&#39;s mom.  Yea, Rachel!!  It means seeing Trai <br/>\nless, but I&#39;m proud of her for seeing that she doesn&#39;t deserve to be <br/>\ntreated like that.  Rachel can&#39;t call him, but Trai is very faithful <br/>\nabout keeping in touch through secret phone calls and the computer on <br/>\nthe days they don&#39;t get together, and they&#39;re still doing fine.  <br/>\nUnfortunately, it has also made Trai&#39;s mom dislike Rachel.  And, of <br/>\ncourse, she&#39;s taking it out on Trai with long lists of jobs for him <br/>\nto do on top of the normal chores she makes him do, which are very <br/>\nexcessive even for a family who believes in chores.  Also, I talked <br/>\nto Trai&#39;s mom and asked her if we could come up with a schedule of <br/>\nregular times that Trai and Rachel can get together.  She loved that <br/>\nbecause of the almighty s word (schedule), and we came up with 3 days <br/>\na week that they can count on for sure being able to get together.  <br/>\nThat took some of the desperation out of the relationship for Trai <br/>\nand Rachel because they know that they will see each other at least 3 <br/>\ntimes a week.  And maybe more if Trai is very obedient and works hard <br/>\nenough for some free time.  His mom actually said that.  Wow, huh?  <br/>\nRachel&#39;s cousin told her that this is a really good way to be able to <br/>\ntell that Trai really cares about her.  Look how hard he works just <br/>\nto be able to see her.

It is completely natural for<br/>\na child to go behind a parent&#39;s back when the parent has set up rules<br/>\nand guidelines in an effort to control that child&#39;s behavior.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbetter to help a child find ways to get what they want in safe and happy<br/>\nways, then strictly forbid it.  Parents set their kids up to defy them<br/>\njust to get what they want and need in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids grow up and meet potential mates, forbidding and controlling a<br/>\nnatural process seems like a really bad idea.  It has always seemed a<br/>\nbetter idea to help a young person through that process with talking and<br/>\nguidance.  All people have reactionary behavior to control and<br/>\nmanipulation.  A parent simple can&#39;t know how that kind of reaction will<br/>\ngo, except that it creates division between parent and child when there<br/>\nneed not be.  Some kids run away or kill themselves or escape through<br/>\ndrugs and other self destructive behavior, some simply grow up and move<br/>\naway and make forced calls on mother&#39;s day or father&#39;s day, some don&#39;t<br/>\neven do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids grow up and do what they want to do regardless of wether the parent<br/>\nwants them to or not.  It just seems so much better to go through that<br/>\nprocess in a manner that ends with parent and child still talking and<br/>\nfriendly.

I had to stop that<br/>\nfrom happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stepped out of the drama.  I don&#39;t talk to that man at all, ever,<br/>\nperiod!  All communication goes through the kids, or sometimes the mom<br/>\nor step mom.  I cut him out of the picture.  Yes, he still does yucky<br/>\nthings, but once I stepped out of all of it, I was able to breathe and<br/>\nrelax and focus on what was good and happy, which was most definitely<br/>\nnot him!  Now watching on the sidelines a bit, I can see him spiraling<br/>\nout of control, he&#39;s lost the game.  Once your kids hate you, you&#39;ve<br/>\nlost, at least that&#39;s how I feel about  it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time he accused me of disrespecting his parenting, and I told him he<br/>\nwas right, that I really had no respect at all for the way he parents,<br/>\nand it&#39;s absolutely true.  It felt good to say it!  I love my daughter,<br/>\nI respect her choices, I love my daughter&#39;s friend and I feel really<br/>\nbadly that she has such a horrible father.  If I could, I would change<br/>\nit, but I can&#39;t, so I don&#39;t try.

Thank you so much for helping me!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I drive Rachel to her boyfriend, Trai&#39;s house and pick her up when<br/>\n&gt; she calls. I try to take him to our house as much as I can too<br/>\n&gt; though. They met at a homeschool co-op type thing that meets for<br/>\n&gt; classes once a week. Rachel wanted to take an art class she saw they<br/>\n&gt; were offering and he was taking a full load of academics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They do have cell phones and texting. He calls her as much as he<br/>\n&gt; can. She&#39;s not allowed to call him, because his mom thinks it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; innapropriate for a girl to call a boy. His mom keeps his cell phone<br/>\n&gt; in her pocket, and he has to ask permission to make a call. She does<br/>\n&gt; make him take it with him when he&#39;s working outside, so he will sneak<br/>\n&gt; calls during those times. He has to erase the call records so she<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t know. Internet communication is easier, because he does this<br/>\n&gt; online high school which requires him to be logged on for at least 4<br/>\n&gt; hours a day. They set up a blog called &quot;Have a Little Lamb&quot; (Rachel<br/>\n&gt; means lamb), and they communicate through that. They also made a<br/>\n&gt; myspace page under the name &quot;Traichel&quot; that they use. But his mom<br/>\n&gt; looks over his shoulder, so it can be a little tricky. And, like the<br/>\n&gt; phone calls, he has to remember to delete the record of those<br/>\n&gt; websites from the history so she won&#39;t find them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you explain a little more of what you mean by detachment?

That<br/>\n&gt; could be. But she&#39;s very upset a lot of the time. I think the<br/>\n&gt; twilight zone feeling she gets from being at his house is getting to<br/>\n&gt; her and making her forget who she is. She seems disoriented a lot,<br/>\n&gt; and she doesn&#39;t leave my side. She is even sleeping in my room again<br/>\n&gt; like she did when she was little. She&#39;s always been very strong, but<br/>\n&gt; she seems to have become a shadow of herself. I also hadn&#39;t thought<br/>\n&gt; about my own history contributing to how stressed I am about the<br/>\n&gt; whole thing.

Thank you so much for helping me! <br/>\n<br/>\nI drive Rachel to her boyfriend, Trai&#39;s house and pick her up when <br/>\nshe calls.  I try to take him to our house as much as I can too <br/>\nthough.  They met at a homeschool co-op type thing that meets for <br/>\nclasses once a week.  Rachel wanted to take an art class she saw they <br/>\nwere offering and he was taking a full load of academics.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey do have cell phones and texting.  He calls her as much as he <br/>\ncan.  She&#39;s not allowed to call him, because his mom thinks it&#39;s <br/>\ninnapropriate for a girl to call a boy.  His mom keeps his cell phone <br/>\nin her pocket, and he has to ask permission to make a call.  She does <br/>\nmake him take it with him when he&#39;s working outside, so he will sneak <br/>\ncalls during those times.  He has to erase the call records so she <br/>\nwon&#39;t know.  Internet communication is easier, because he does this <br/>\nonline high school which requires him to be logged on for at least 4 <br/>\nhours a day.  They set up a blog called &quot;Have a Little Lamb&quot; (Rachel <br/>\nmeans lamb), and they communicate through that.  They also made a <br/>\nmyspace page under the name &quot;Traichel&quot; that they use.  But his mom <br/>\nlooks over his shoulder, so it can be a little tricky.  And, like the <br/>\nphone calls, he has to remember to delete the record of those <br/>\nwebsites from the history so she won&#39;t find them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you explain a little more of what you mean by detachment?

She&#39;s always been very strong, but <br/>\nshe seems to have become a shadow of herself.  I also hadn&#39;t thought <br/>\nabout my own history contributing to how stressed I am about the <br/>\nwhole thing.

I love her<br/>\n&gt; boyfriend a lot.  He and Rachel have a great time together.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think the relationship between the two of them is bad at all.  But<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s from one of those military-like, southern Bible belt, slave<br/>\n&gt; driving, &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; families.  His mom barks<br/>\n&gt; her orders and expects my daughter to obey them.  She literally<br/>\n&gt; screams at Rachel and her boyfriend.  She puts them both down all the<br/>\n&gt; time.  She wields Rachel like a weapon against her boyfriend<br/>\n&gt; threatening to force him to break up with her if they don&#39;t do what<br/>\n&gt; she says, and they have to do it to perfection.  Rachel has walked<br/>\n&gt; their dogs, painted rooms in their house, cleaned up their yard, fed<br/>\n&gt; their horses, cleaned their horses stalls, done their laundry, taken<br/>\n&gt; care of their 2 year old twins, and probably a lot more that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know about.  She never pays Rachel for anything or offers anything in<br/>\n&gt; return for all the work.  She doesn&#39;t even feed Rachel when she&#39;s at<br/>\n&gt; their house.  If they get hungry at his house, Rachel&#39;s boyfriend has<br/>\n&gt; to order a pizza or take Rachel out somewhere to eat.  Rachel has<br/>\n&gt; even called me from a restaurant asking me for my credit card number<br/>\n&gt; when her boyfriend&#39;s mom failed to show up to take them out to eat as<br/>\n&gt; a thank you for something extra they did.  I see Rachel wilting<br/>\n&gt; before my eyes.  Our family is not like that at all.  My own mom was<br/>\n&gt; a hippie unschool mom, and Rachel is a second generation unschooler.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m so surprised that she will respond to such disrespect when she<br/>\n&gt; has no obligation whatsoever to do anything this lady says.  But she<br/>\n&gt; knows that her boyfriend will not be allowed to see her if his mom<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t like her, so she does it all.  Also, I&#39;m finding myself doing<br/>\n&gt; things according to his mom too, because I know how much Rachel and<br/>\n&gt; her boyfriend mean to each other.  I know that if his mom feels like<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re &quot;heathens&quot; she will never let him see Rachel.  I&#39;ve never been<br/>\n&gt; made to feel so low before.

Rachel has walked<br/>\n&gt; their dogs, painted rooms in their house, cleaned up their yard, fed<br/>\n&gt; their horses, cleaned their horses stalls, done their laundry, taken<br/>\n&gt; care of their 2 year old twins, and probably a lot more that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know about.  She never pays Rachel for anything or offers anything in<br/>\n&gt; return for all the work.  She doesn&#39;t even feed Rachel when she&#39;s at<br/>\n&gt; their house.

Also, I&#39;m finding myself doing<br/>\n&gt; things according to his mom too, because I know how much Rachel and<br/>\n&gt; her boyfriend mean to each other.

My own mom was  <br/>\na hippie unschool mom, and Rachel is a second generation unschooler.   <br/>\nI&#39;m so surprised that she will respond to such disrespect when she  <br/>\nhas no obligation whatsoever to do anything this lady says.  But she  <br/>\nknows that her boyfriend will not be allowed to see her if his mom  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like her, so she does it all.  Also, I&#39;m finding myself doing  <br/>\nthings according to his mom too, because I know how much Rachel and  <br/>\nher boyfriend mean to each other.  I know that if his mom feels like  <br/>\nwe&#39;re &quot;heathens&quot; she will never let him see Rachel.  I&#39;ve never been  <br/>\nmade to feel so low before.  It&#39;s not like me to even worry about  <br/>\nthat.  This lady is reaching into my home and wreaking havoc.  I feel  <br/>\nlike we&#39;re being terrorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to handle it at all.  We&#39;ve always lived so  <br/>\nnaturally and peacefully together.  I don&#39;t have &quot;requirements&quot; that  <br/>\nshe has to fulfill in order to be allowed to live in her own house.   <br/>\nFor the first time in Rachel&#39;s life I&#39;m tempted to force something.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d be forcing, and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d even  <br/>\nrespond to such a thing coming from me, but Rachel hasn&#39;t done  <br/>\nanything at all in the past 3 months unless she&#39;s with her  <br/>\nboyfriend.  She&#39;s one of those musician, dancer, artist, poet types.   <br/>\nI think she&#39;s so talented in so many things.  It looks to me like  <br/>\nshe&#39;s just wasting away.  I don&#39;t want her to be involved with this  <br/>\nabusive family, but I do want her to be able to stay with her  <br/>\nboyfriend.  I&#39;m not going to tell her she has to break up with him  <br/>\nlike his mom threatens all the time.  I want her to connect with  <br/>\nother unschoolers, but I don&#39;t really know any.  We have lots of  <br/>\nhomeschooling families around us, but they all think unschooling is  <br/>\nevil.<br/>\n   He he.  (seriously, they really do).  They&#39;re not exactly my  <br/>\nbiggest fans.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have it.<br/>\nI would be glad to share any of this with anybody.  Any counsel would  <br/>\nbe great!  The more the merrier!<br/>\n*****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response to her was this:<br/>\n<br/>\n++++++++++<br/>\nI have ideas about the larger problem, but I&#39;d rather take this to  <br/>\nthe AlwaysLearning list, I think.   I&#39;m thinking of some specific  <br/>\npeople who might be able to help you there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this might possibly help you to think about her mental state  <br/>\nin the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com\">http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRead the intro post and then poke around there.  It&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve  <br/>\nwritten or quoted.<br/>\n+++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I recommended that until I got a chance to put this here  <br/>\nis that if a girl is in love, that would explain the appearance that  <br/>\nshe does nothing when she&#39;s not with the boy and that she seems to be  <br/>\nwasting away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what practical advice might help?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37662,"nextTopicId":37615}}
