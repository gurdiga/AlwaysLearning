As life would have it, I do some work that involves people with TBI. <br/>\n<br/>\nTBIs don&#39;t ever recover. The injured brain material is gone, there is a whole in the brain. The brain does compensate and there are strategies to deal with the results. The hardest part is sometimes he is his old self, then he isn&#39;t. He seems to understand, sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s unpredictable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our strategies: we deal with most everything as a family. When the kids were little, we put on the Barney &quot;clean-up&quot; song or the Snow White &quot;whistle while you work&quot; and cleaned the house together. Now as teens, they like living in a clean house & contribute to maintenance without prompting. <br/>\n<br/>\nDealing with a spouse with TBI doesn&#39;t compare with other people&#39;s spousal issues. It is complicated for medical reasons. They may or may not realize what they&#39;ve said on a variety of levels depending on the part of the brain that was injured, even though they seem okay most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Family harmony and unschooling","postDate":"1301762103","msgId":60524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExRkIzRDZGLUNGQ0UtNDcyQy04MDM5LTExNkE2REE1RjJEOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGluN2NscCttdWg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGluN2NscCttdWg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60523,"nextInTopic":60525,"prevInTime":60523,"nextInTime":60525,"topicId":60489,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-As time went on, I found I was feeling more whole, less frustrated, less sad at my own childhood.

TOTAL and complete &quot;recovery&quot; from childhood hurts isn&#39;t necessary; probably isn&#39;t even possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been true for me. If my kids had to wait for me to be totally recovered from my childhood they&#39;d never get the Mom I want for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of starting out to heal myself, I simply wanted my children to be happier than I had been.  It started in small steps.  If I got advice about how to handle a situation or behavior, and the method resulted in a miserable kid (and a miserable me as well) then I looked for another way.  It just never felt right to keep doing anything to my children that made them unhappy.  Day by day, one situation at a time, I just responded as in the most loving manner I could.  I learned to ignore all the voices telling me what I had to do my child to get him to &#39;behave.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nAs time went on, I found I was feeling more whole, less frustrated, less sad at my own childhood.  The healing came in giving my children what made them happy. My peace and progress have come as a by-product of seeking peace and happiness for my children, not as something I ever specifically sought.  I didn&#39;t really expect to feel as peaceful as I now do about my childhood.  I can talk about my mother without anger (I still can&#39;t talk TO her, but I don&#39;t want to) or judgment or any need to &#39;show her&#39;. I can talk about my and to my Dad, without my heart breaking and feeling unloved. It was a wonderful surprise to me to find peace instead of anger mixed in with the sadness at my childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you find ways to help your husband have more peaceful time with the family? What can you do to make it easier for him to enjoy the kids, and for the kids to enjoy time with their Dad?  How can you remove obstacles to them having fun together? To support them all in their relationship?  Maybe you could think of it as a gift to the little boy he was; the one who was spanked and had his ear pulled?<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often, Moms show up here wanting to know how they can protect their kids from the punitive husband.

Even an hour of focused clutter removal daily can make a huge difference. I once had a &quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; (another option) who would come a couple of times a week. She would play with the kids while I cleaned or clean while I played with the kids -- whichever suited the kids better on any given day. It was great and soo very helpful in managing the mess.

Having someone other than your husband doing at least some if it regularly may make it easier for him to tolerate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a long, cold winter here too. My son is very cold-hearty but my daughter (and I) are not. Around February, my daughter started refusing to go out. Being in the cold became intolerable for her even for short periods. I worked really hard to make home more fun for both kids. I got lots of movies, books and interesting and novel art materials and projects.  I ordered from science catalogs. We made various slimy concoctions for them to play with. We got interesting fruits at the market. I got magazine subscriptions for them. I always had something new and interesting to pull out when we were heading to the doldrums. The days and weeks passed much more happily with so many new and interesting things to explore.

His parents pulled him out of school at 16 and he went off to music school in Hollywood.

And sometimes these ideas seems to help him to be less grumpy and nagging about the messes.

I hope that you are not, in your deepest heart, thinking anything like &quot;this is not a real concern, it&#39;s just because of his accident.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI only say this because it&#39;s a real issue. Some people are really much more bothered by visual disorder than others. In some people it builds up. There is a thing called &quot;clutter blindness&quot; that is a hallmark of hoarders. Unfortunately I have the facility for clutter blindness, and sometimes it does take my dh expressing frustration (and he is really patient about it) for me to notice the clutter. If clutter blindness is a thing, perhaps the opposite is also a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously my situation is different from the OP&#39;s, in that I am the one at home most of the time, although I do spend much of that working. The division of household stuff is something that has been a low grade nagging ache in our (dh & mine) relationship since I started working outside the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever a number of years ago my dh was being really cranky and twitchy and long story short, it turned out that the then current level of mess was bringing up deep seated fears of abandonment. He thought I had ceased taking care of &quot;his&quot; home because I was planning to leave. My astonishment was boundless. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I agree with Sandra, that your day off should be one for reconnecting with your kids, and giving him a break, rather than cleaning the house, I also wonder if you, the grandparent caregivers and your dh couldn&#39;t do some more practical brainstorming about keeping the level of clutter more manageable for dh. (I add that I don&#39;t think it is reasonable to expect an immaculate home in the presence of any children playing, let alone unschoolers who use their home as their lab, workshop and art studio.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome suggestions I have include:<br/>\n<br/>\nGeography - reorganizing the spaces where projects and play occur in the house. Maybe there is a room (or closet - Jayn used to play in the coat closet off the living room) that you can close the door upon, or pull a curtain. Maybe dh needs a place that he can sit where he has a serene view out the window instead of facing the mess, his own cave. Perhaps a playhouse outside would be helpful at least over summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPragmatism - maybe there are ways to reorganize the storage of toys and materials so that they can be cleaned up much more easily - rolling bins, I love labels, low flat bins that slide under beds, stacking things under the hall table and maybe hiding it with a tablecloth, armoires instead of open shelves. Maybe dh needs some easier clean up strategies so that he is not overwhelmed by the task of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay methods - Low tables that have a top that fits over them to hide the set up below, rolling tables that can be moved back to the aforementioned play room, using big trays for ongoing set ups that can be carried away intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for anger, we are working on that over here, and I will be interested to read the responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that Jayn is a total mirror of the emotional state of first me, second dh, and third the state of dh&my relationship. If we are stressed, especially because of outside forces such as money worries or job stressors, Jayn becomes more cranky and even more rigorous in protecting what she evidently perceives as an intention on our part to control her. (Generally this is a mistaken belief on her part, I might add - but that doesn&#39;t mitigate her defensive feelings.)<br/>\n<br/>\n===My oldest daughter goes through periods of increased anxiety that affect her willingness to go places with family members other than me. My daughter&#39;s anxiety seemed to skyrocket over the winter.  She didn&#39;t want to go next door to Grandma&#39;s house on the days my Mother-in-law watches them. She mostly refused to go anywhere with my DH when he would attempt to get them out of the house to change the scenery. She wanted her sister to be with her if they did decide to go somewhere, and did not want her sister to go without her.=====<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that your eldest dd is feeling a lack of control in her life possibly because of the constant shifts in caregivers, or possibly because of what might be a volatility in your dh&#39;s emotional state, or some other reason. This feeling could be causing her to want to exert control on those around her, including her younger sister. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn rarely wants to go on generalized outings, and certainly never wants to go to park days - but she does like going to specific pre-planned events like play dates with her friends. She used to be a lot more flexible about spontaneous notions; now (at 11.5) not so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could organize some visitors for your eldest - a playdate with a parent who stays, while dh takes the younger out on her outing. If dd8 has someone else to play with she might be happier about relinquishing her sister. <br/>\n<br/>\nDh tends to react strongly when he believes that I am under attack from Jayn. It never helps in the moment. What helps is always for me to remain as calm and soft spoken as possible with both of them.<br/>\n <br/>\n====Because I have to work to support our family, my feelings of inadequacy for not being present or being the stay-at-home parent was growing. My DH&#39;s lack of tolerance for the increased fighting and clutter seemed unfair to my daughters.  So the question kept arising, &quot;Would they be better off in school?&quot;====<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s that mirror again. Your dd is possibly (I might say probably) mirroring your emotional state - even if it is unspoken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey =might= be better off in school. They might be better off in a home school co-op situation where they get to make mess elsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I suspect that the girls could simply exchange one set of stressors for another even sharper set, and you could have greater guilt on top of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you and dh to find ways to release his anxiety. I hope you can find a way to be home more. I hope he can find strategies for being calmer in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this brain injury the deal breaker? Maybe Grandma should have more time with the girls. Maybe you and he need more date nights, even just lunch out or a drive to watch the sunset. Helps dh and I a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting to the point of rambling now, so I&#39;ll stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

This","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-84568987\">I am wondering if experienced unschoolers out there can help shed some light on what we may be able to do differently to bring back the family peace. This situation feels complicated by the fact that I work outside the home, and my husband (very supportive of unschooling) and our parents are the primary caregivers. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past couple of months, I have been riding an emotional rollercoaster with regards to family harmony and disharmony. As a result, I have spent many hours exploring whether continuing with unschooling is appropriate, or whether school might be a better answereven if only for the short term.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt times I feel confused and lost, and at other times my conviction one way or another is strong and right. My husband and I have discussed the pros and the cons of both sides, and I have been asking my children which way they want to go. In the end, I still have no clear answers.  My heart wants to continue unschooling wholly and completely. My oldest daughter (8) does not want to be in school, and my youngest daughter (5) does not know what school is all about, but thinks that she would like to be there...sometimes. She just as easily says she does not want to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past two years everything has been fine. Then came December. The kids came down with the first of several serious colds of the winter. Added to the all ready stir-crazy feelings we felt, the weather in December and February was unusually cold and miserable.  Below zero temperatures, no snow for snow play, and a heightened anxiety on the part of my oldest daughter about leaving the house made more some seriously long weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter goes through periods of increased anxiety that affect her willingness to go places with family members other than me. My daughter&#39;s anxiety seemed to skyrocket over the winter.  She didn&#39;t want to go next door to Grandma&#39;s house on the days my Mother-in-law watches them. She mostly refused to go anywhere with my DH when he would attempt to get them out of the house to change the scenery. She wanted her sister to be with her if they did decide to go somewhere, and did not want her sister to go without her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these things seem to have led up to an increase in the fighting between my daughters and an increase in the amount of clean-up we have to do as a result of being at home so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH cannot tolerate fighting between them at all.  He will go from 0 to 100 in a second flat...with zero being kind, loving, and tolerant and 100 being flat-out yelling at them to stop. He and I have discussed this a lot, and he feels like a couple things contribute to his not being able to tolerate this well.  First is his own childhood and his experience with his older sister, and the way his father handled things. Second is the fact that he suffered a brain injury 8 years ago that has caused a decreased ability to tolerate things he might have easily tolerated prior to the accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also cannot tolerate the amount of clutter that generates as a result to the kids playing and creating all day. The piles of drawings, the remnants of playing store, or cars, or school, or polly pockets grate against him and contribute to his stress level.  Even when we clean it up every day, the fact that it is generated the next wears him out all over again. I often spend my one day off mid-week over-cleaning to prevent more conflictbut that results in my girls needing me more, and to more bad feelings because I was cleaning and not being present for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncreased angst between my DH and my DDs led to increased angst between him and me. I&#39;ve had moments of not handling it well within the past several months. Things have been rapidly improving with nicer weather.  But for a while, it seemed that our household was a den of unpleasant talk, sibling conflict, parental angst, and a whole lot of elevated voices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I have to work to support our family, my feelings of inadequacy for not being present or being the stay-at-home parent was growing. My DH&#39;s lack of tolerance for the increased fighting and clutter seemed unfair to my daughters.  So the question kept arising, &quot;Would they be better off in school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then I started off onto the school path with conviction.  I decided to attend the special Kindergarten registration in two weeks. I found out who the 3rd grade teachers are. I got all the paperwork needed to register my oldest for school once again. I started feeling good about this choice.  Easy schedules would lead to harmony. Being in school would prevent the sister conflicts because they would not be together all day. My house would be clean because the girls would not be home for a good chunk of the day. They would see their friends more. My DH would be much less stressed out over clutter and conflict. I would be less stressed because he is less stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I started having second thoughts.  After reviewing the 2nd grade work my friend&#39;s daughter is doing, and thinking about what we might need to &quot;get up to speed&quot; for 3rd grade, I realized how very much I don&#39;t want my kids in school, and why we pulled our oldest out to begin with.  So I had some deep heart-to-heart talks with my DH about what we can do differently to ensure that next winter doesn&#39;t end up like this past one. He is fully supportive of unschooling, but it&#39;s the simple issues like fighting, cleaning up clutter, or the unwillingness to get out and do stuff that wear him down and then stress him out. And he is the one who is with them most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur parents felt the pain of the issues as well, with my mother-in-law heading to the local library to check out books on child psychology and development. And my Mom asking if my youngest would be attending Kindergarten in the fall so that &quot;she can have her own life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile things are much more calm recently, the storm does not feel like it&#39;s over. My oldest is still expressing a deep rage, on occasion, that is directed towards me, and is a challenge all on its own.  Despite our recent discussions on continuing without school, my husband is still reacting to situations, rather than responding with some forethought. (I realize that recent discussions aren&#39;t going to magically change the way he deals with things, but I was hopeful.) I still have feelings of being on the edge...caught between wanting to unschool and wondering if school would be better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore than anything, I feel like I&#39;m missing something that might be the key to bringing in more peace.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for reading, I realize long posts take a lot of time to go through.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7969,"nextTopicId":60535}}
