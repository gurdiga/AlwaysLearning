That has been proven in court, in  <br/>\nthe case in which a girl&#39;s mother (or a girl pretending to be her  <br/>\nmother or whatever) pretended to be a teenaged boy to lead on and  <br/>\nthen crush a neighbor, who killed herself.  No, the judge said there  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a law that had been broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nA reporter who misquotes can lose his job.   A witness who misquotes  <br/>\nunder oath can go to jail.  In a forum like this, though, dishonesty  <br/>\nis not a crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo take money after misrepresenting oneself?  That&#39;s not the same  <br/>\nlevel of &quot;legal,&quot; though the morality matches.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been frustrated lately with a couple of (two or three)  <br/>\nunschooling writers/commenters/speakers (not specifically all three  <br/>\nnor great at those, and not on this list) who have misrepresented  <br/>\nthemselves in small or large ways.  It bohers me because I don&#39;t like  <br/>\ndishonesty a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with ideas, more than with people.  If something makes sense and  <br/>\nwhen you try it it&#39;s  helpful, DO IT.  If you can figure out a great  <br/>\nway to describe your discovery or experience  so that others can have  <br/>\nbetter lives and if you&#39;re willing to do that, wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who&#39;s here just for excitement, I don&#39;t mind if you want to  <br/>\nlurk and hope for fireworks, but don&#39;t build or light any.<br/>\nAnyone who&#39;s here to be stroked and soothed and told you&#39;re doing  <br/>\nwonderfully (regardless of what you write), it&#39;s not the list for  <br/>\nyou.  Search &quot;support lists&quot; and &quot;gentle&quot; at yahoogroups or google.   <br/>\nYou&#39;ll find some of the people who came here and were sure they could  <br/>\ndo better.  (Most aren&#39;t doing better and some aren&#39;t doing at all  <br/>\nanymore.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMisquoting a person, using quotation marks is VERY bad writing, bad  <br/>\nform, and in some situations potentially job-risking or illegal.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not helpful, and it&#39;s not moral.  If you want to indicate that  <br/>\nyou think the person said that, or that they said something like  <br/>\nthat, then say so.    If you delete this mail and don&#39;t know how to  <br/>\nget to the messages at yahoo, and you write &quot;I think she said,  <br/>\n&quot;People shouldn&#39;t be  here to light fireworks&quot; that might be close  <br/>\nenough, but as the message is still here and open, either quote me or  <br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33104,"nextTopicId":33192}}
