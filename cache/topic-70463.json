She has a couple homeschooling girl friends she met years ago through a homeschool group, but they don&#39;t have the same interests now, so they don&#39;t have much reason to get together. She&#39;s recently had good luck meeting people online and making friends that way - but then she&#39;s not interested in doing &quot;girly&quot; sorts of social things, she&#39;s interested in writing and drawing and playing Minecraft, all of which work as well or better online than in person. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"ehulani56","from":"&quot;ehulani56&quot; &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"ehulani56","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Making friends","postDate":"1360101803","msgId":70466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtlcnZqYitsYmlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70464,"nextInTopic":70467,"prevInTime":70465,"nextInTime":70467,"topicId":70463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter has found most of her friends over the years through homeschooling park days, unschooling conferences and interest-based gatherings such as aikido,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-403163693\">My daughter has found most of her friends over the years through homeschooling park days, unschooling conferences and interest-based gatherings such as aikido, gymnastics, and Japanese anime/cosplay events (not all of which are homeschooling).
