Can you occassionally post and tell us how things are going with you?  I am interested in your idea of studying to be a naturopath while still being a mommy.  I think trying to balance &quot;getting something done&quot; and still being there when the kids need something is challenging for me, and I&#39;d like to hear how other people handle this.  My kids are older now (11 and 9), and I have recently taken on a project--redoing a house next door to ours to use as rental property.  I can go next door to work, or out in the garden to work, but there&#39;s a limit to how long I can work.  My kids are old enough to do without me for long periods of time, that&#39;s not the issue.  It&#39;s spending enough time with them.  Face time.  Your kids are younger, so once you get them home with you, you will be working on this same balancing act.  How much of the non-mommy stuff to you get done while still making sure your kids get enough of your full attention.   <br/>\n    I do know that when my kids come to me and ask for something, I drop what I am doing.  Right that minute.  And when they were younger, if I spent lots of time with them in the morning, they were less likely to need me in the afternoon.  I could usually find a couple of hours to paint or sew.  <br/>\n    Personally, I need something else going on besides just kids and housework.  I like having something more visible.  But I try very hard to keep from thinking, &quot;Oh, please let me go work&quot; when my kids want me to play video games with them.  <br/>\n    Deirdre<br/>\n  One of the reasons I put my dd back <br/>\n  in school is that I decided to return to College for my BA, but I <br/>\n  have found the classes less than satisfactory because we <br/>\n  frantically write notes only to memorize and regurgetate the info <br/>\n  on the tests.
