Of course, I was trying to find things wrong with what <br/>\nthey were doing but the kids seemed fine and did not seem to mind <br/>\ndoing the work.  The mother would always talk about how much the kids <br/>\nliked doing all they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are having a nice time on our trip yesterday and one of <br/>\nthe mothers tells the school-at-home mother that she saw an email <br/>\nfrom her daughter.
