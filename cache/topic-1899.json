But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1196575875\">First I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m very sorry for your friends porn related trouble with her husband. It really sounds like nightmare to have to live through. But when I was finished reading it, I couldn&#39;t help having some thoughts about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did the husband have a need to look at porn on the computer in the first place? Why did he think it was okay? And was it really because of the computer porn that he had a *need* to go the the strip joints and hookers?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh likes to look at porn sometimes, and I&#39;m sure it has come up on the computer from time to time, only because those sites come up out of nowhere sometimes and all of the sudden they&#39;re in your face. But he chooses not to go for internet porn because it seems to be more distasteful and just plain nastier than your average mag or movie. I don&#39;t get insulted or hurt or anything by his looking at porn sometimes. He treats me well, and is a good father and works hard for our family, etc... He is not any less of a good person because he looks at porn. I would definitely draw the line on what kind it is - if it involves children or really hurting other people - I think that&#39;s wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is that in the situation you described with your friend, maybe his parents or religion shamed him or he was made to feel bad for looking at or liking porn when he was younger. He may have been forced to push aside his natural desire to look at it, because he was told those images are wrong, nasty, dirty, etc... So that when he grew up and had the access to it, he really went crazy and became irrational about it. I think there is a very fine line to draw with how you should handle porn with your kids, and I think it&#39;s always healthy to talk about it as much as possible, if you can do it without squirming too much! The issue has not really come up with our boys yet as they are still kind of young (8 and 10) and whatever we have around the house is well hidden. But I am reading this topic with great interest and taking notes for future reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joylyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for writing this.

We talked about why they had to trick (not a<br/>\npun :)) themselves into thinking it was OK....the<br/>\nboys, of course were curious....&quot;where, where?&quot; &quot;her?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;him?&quot;. We talked about what if it was them? or me? or<br/>\nKyla (the niece we cared for as a toddler).....what<br/>\nkinds of situations could trap someone it that kind of<br/>\nslavery?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried not to share MY OWN experiences, as I am very<br/>\nprivate, verging on prudish, due to....well that is<br/>\njust me, now.  I can be very open in a cerebral sort<br/>\nof way, and I am very open when it seems to me to be<br/>\nto the benefit (from my point of view) of someone who<br/>\nwants or needs benefiting (I try to say, always, &quot;have<br/>\nyou thought about?&quot; or &quot;This has been my experience&quot;<br/>\nsomething that makes it non-advice, just information. <br/>\nIt is a counseling technique to prevent dependence and<br/>\nattachment....used it with my clients, too). Still, it<br/>\nonly seems fair to use use myself instead of<br/>\nsomeonelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am guilty of covertly monitoring the boys (and<br/>\nNancy, the sister of whom I had custody from age 11<br/>\nand the care and support of off and own from her<br/>\nbirth) what they read, said, did, and who their<br/>\nfriends were.  Most of their friends called me Mama,<br/>\ntoo.  I told them, that if they wanted their stuff<br/>\nprivate, they had to do the cleaning.  If I was to do<br/>\nthe cleaning, then whatever I came across was not<br/>\nprivate.  Huck had a Penthouse under his mattress, I<br/>\nlooked though it (well, I am curious, too....and i was<br/>\ncomparing the models to me....and to the girls I KNEW<br/>\nhe liked. Quite dissimilar) put it back. He also had <br/>\nroach farm (REALLY) in his desk in and old aquarium.<br/>\nThis was a BIG desk with a safe sort of place<br/>\nunderneath.  I helped him, some, with this project. <br/>\nHe wanted to enter the Big Roach contest (Texas) and<br/>\nwin a bunch of money.  David had some Playboys at one<br/>\ntime.  Moses had some roaches of a different sort and<br/>\nsome seeds. These and the residue had to go! Jail is<br/>\ntoo big a risk!! We talked about that and the other<br/>\nkids and parents and ...... he wondered how I found<br/>\nthis evidence ..... I just went right to it, actually.<br/>\nMother&#39;s intuition. I told him not to count on it<br/>\n(Mother&#39;s intuition) all the time though... he had to<br/>\ntake responsibility for his own actions...<br/>\n<br/>\nI once had to fetch Nancy from a juvinal detention<br/>\ncenter.  She, and a gaggle of girls had decided to<br/>\nhitch to the beach...on the other side of the state!<br/>\nSome of the girl&#39;s mother&#39;s were so angry they wanted<br/>\nto let their children spend the night there!...I<br/>\ntalked everyone into letting me bring them all home. <br/>\nThere were kids in CHAINS there! Another time, she was<br/>\nwell, anyway,.......<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted them all to know that NO MATTER WHAT, I was<br/>\non their side.  Entirely. But if there was a problem,<br/>\nI did need to know eveyrhting about what was going on,<br/>\nin order for us to figure out what to do. Nancy was<br/>\nthe hardest. Not the boys. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most difficult thing about the boys was cars and<br/>\nmotorcycles.  Boy insurance costs more.  And they DO<br/>\nlike to drive fast!  <br/>\n<br/>\nALL those years of listening....really listening....to<br/>\nwhat they had to say about everything. I had to be<br/>\ninterested in all of their selves (including motors)<br/>\n, not just one aspect of them, in order for them to be<br/>\nable to share with me.... so I knew that David and Kim<br/>\nwhere virgins and that David has never been kissed<br/>\nanother girl than his wife, Kim.  I know that the<br/>\ndental hygienist was stalking Huck.....it was WAY more<br/>\nthan flirting....and we put together a strategy to<br/>\ngently divert her...and when he had a flea bite on the<br/>\nedge of his foreskin, he was able to ask me about it<br/>\n(at age 14) He and his girlfriend just are a lovely<br/>\ncouple. And I just helped Moses get a double bed<br/>\ninstead of the single he had so that he and his<br/>\ngirlfriend could sleep more comfortably.  She just<br/>\nmoved in with him.  I even loaned &#39;em my truck to<br/>\nmove.

The TV had<br/>\ndrapes (scarves and such) or a leg lifted to just<br/>\nbarely (pun) conceal. The biggest taboo that was<br/>\neroticized was guns.  They were fondled, viewed from<br/>\nall angles, examined and exclaimed over. Now there is <br/>\npopular erotic animation, some of which is written to<br/>\nthe young GIRL audience.

Their<br/>\nthought was that if I was offended, to look the other<br/>\nway. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey do have public baths in Japan, for those who<br/>\ndon&#39;t have bathing facilities at home...or for those<br/>\nwho prefer the social aspect of group bathing. XDH<br/>\nused the baths, I, and sons, did not. He said there<br/>\nwas a low barrier between the men and women, but it<br/>\ncould be looked over, if anyone wanted to. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little, I used to look in National<br/>\nGeographic, sometimes, to check out the nude folks in<br/>\nother parts of the world.  They seem to mostly be<br/>\nwearing clothes,now. Even in the hot places.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOS<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"doddgoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teenaged Boys and Sexuality","postDate":"1009898884","msgId":1982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3MWY2WWt3bjlXZ3RjMlM2QUEwMDAxMzZmMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1966,"nextInTopic":1983,"prevInTime":1981,"nextInTime":1983,"topicId":1899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been debating whether or not to give my opinion on this one.

We&#39;ve been <br/>\nthrough something similar, but with a weird twist. You see, my &quot;I never <br/>\nthrow away any magazine&quot; hubby has every Playboy he ever received since he <br/>\nwas 18. And he&#39;s had a subscription. It&#39;s never bothered me, and yes the <br/>\narticles are good. I have notice the pictures getting downright silly <br/>\nlately, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my 12 year old son found the old boxes of mags last year. We would <br/>\nfind magazines, parts of magazines, cut-outs from magazines,etc. in various <br/>\nplaces around his room. We weren&#39;t snooping, just cleaning and such. And he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t making a big effort to hide them. My dh and I each had many <br/>\nconversations with him about sexuality, respecting women, why a women would <br/>\npose, how it might be harmful, when it&#39;s not, etc. We also asked him not to <br/>\ngo into the old stashes or share them with his friends. I wasn&#39;t about to be <br/>\nknown as the Porn Momma. And my dh politely explained that a pristine copy <br/>\nof an old Playboy is worth money, a cut up one is worth nothing. My son <br/>\nunderstood that concept right away. :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we boxed up the old copies and they&#39;re stored away. My son hasn&#39;t been in <br/>\nthem since. Of course, that&#39;s not to say that he&#39;s not looking at the new <br/>\nones lying around. (Yes, the subscription is still current. Men *are* <br/>\nvisual.) But we treat it like the army. Don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell. I also <br/>\nprovided ds with books on puberty, sexuality and there are plenty of <br/>\ngratuitous shots in most PG-13 movies to keep any 12/13 year old interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did find some internet porn a couple of times and I was very honest with <br/>\nhim about my feelings. From what I&#39;ve seen that stuff is pretty angry and <br/>\nusually gross. Not just pictures of lovely ladies. I told him pretty much <br/>\nwhat others here have been saying about the violence against women and such. <br/>\nHe agreed that the images disturbed him. I think he prefers what he can find <br/>\nlying around the house. I probably wouldn&#39;t hesitate to install filtering <br/>\nsoftware if need be. But there seems to be no problem right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIssues like pornagraphy are not always black and white for me. There&#39;s lots <br/>\nof gray area concerning what bothers me and what doesn&#39;t. One thing I do <br/>\nknow for sure, though, there is no better male role model for my son than my <br/>\nhusband.

I just asked Kirby.  He said &quot;The <br/>\nhen-tai is much more vile than real porn. &quot;  He recommends against that--that <br/>\nit&#39;s gross fantasy stuff with tentacle rape and stuff.  And you have to be <br/>\n21.  And even then it&#39;s too gross, says Kirby.]<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby and I think maybe if you live where there&#39;s a used magazine, used <br/>\nbookstore where you can get Playboys from different decades that might be <br/>\ngood.  Or just used Playboys (garage sales, sometimes).  Or new mom-bought.   <br/>\nThere really is a fair amount of stuff to read, usually a really good <br/>\ninterview, and then pictures of women who wanted to be in there.  Sometimes <br/>\nfamous women (sometimes later-famous women).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that just saying no is like telling the ocean to be still.  And <br/>\nsaying &quot;Not in MY house&quot; is the beginning of dishonesty or moving out, or <br/>\nboth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my boys lying to me.  So far we can talk about things like this, <br/>\nand if I draw the line in a place they don&#39;t accept, we&#39;re no longer sharing <br/>\ncommon lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeminist arguments about pornography demeaning women aren&#39;t true across the <br/>\nboard.  They have a point, but it&#39;s too narrowly focussed, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are men who will never, ever have real-life sex.  They will grow, never <br/>\nmarry, never have a date, and die alone.  Lots of them.  Let them look at <br/>\npictures.  There are women in similar circumstances.  I have a Mormon friend <br/>\nwho never married, ever.  She wouldn&#39;t settle for imperfection.  I have a <br/>\nclose friend who has had two boyfriends.  Now she&#39;s nearly 40, very overweight<br/>\n, doesn&#39;t much socialize, and doesn&#39;t intend to.  Let her read dirty books if <br/>\nshe wants to.   I own more erotic stories than I would have if Keith had not <br/>\nlived in Minneapolis for three and a half years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teenaged Boys and Sexuality","postDate":"1009825902","msgId":1956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIzMTExMDkzNS4wMGExZTk0MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDVmLjIwMjc3MjJkLjI5NjFmMzA3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1950,"nextInTopic":1966,"prevInTime":1955,"nextInTime":1957,"topicId":1899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve got a lad with <br/>\nraging hormones, and he&#39;s been frequenting porn sites on the internet.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure how to deal with it.  His older brother didn&#39;t have the internet <br/>\nand contented himself with pictures of women in underwear in advertising <br/>\nflyers.  (At least that&#39;s what his girlfriend at one time was upset about.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a problem with him getting his jollies from looking at <br/>\npictures.  At least I don&#39;t think so.  But I have to admit that some of <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s been looking at really grosses me out.  (He doesn&#39;t realize that <br/>\nthe pictures he&#39;s been looking at go into a temp file.)  The knowledge that <br/>\nthe women in those pictures likely weren&#39;t entirely willing participants <br/>\nbothers me as well.  Sometimes I feel like asking him what it would take to <br/>\nbare his privates on the internet for everyone who wants to to look at.  I <br/>\nmay well do that.  He&#39;s very modest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m aware of his recent excursions.  We talked about <br/>\nit when I discovered it a few months ago.  At the time, he was using the <br/>\ncomputer that&#39;s provided by the school program we use, and they&#39;re supposed <br/>\nto be quite strict about no porn or hate sites.  (They say they can find <br/>\nout, but I didn&#39;t really believe it before, and they haven&#39;t said anything <br/>\nyet.)  Now he&#39;s using our own computer, so I don&#39;t have that reason to say <br/>\nhe isn&#39;t allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sort of inclined to offer him some kind of erotic materials, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really know what.  The only books that come to mind are The Joy of <br/>\nSex and The Kama Sutra, but I don&#39;t know how interesting or appropriate <br/>\nthey&#39;d be.  It&#39;s been a long time since I looked at either one.  There&#39;s <br/>\nPlayboy, which I&#39;m not crazy about, but it&#39;s a lot better than the porn <br/>\nsites.  And they really do have some good articles.   At least they did 30 <br/>\nyears ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certainly good novels that have some good sex scenes in them, <br/>\nthat might satisfy some curiosity and hormonal urges.
