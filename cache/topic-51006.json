If a toy was packaged in such a way<br/>\nthat he couldn&#39;t really play with it, we talked together about what it does<br/>\nand how it might work (how Karl thinks it works?) and converse about it for<br/>\na bit then pointed out another toy I thought he might be interested in too<br/>\nand started talking about that toy. And on and on and on. With no need to<br/>\nactually buy any of these toys.  Even now that he&#39;s older, Karl doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto BUY the toy to &quot;have&quot; it for a time. And I would usually get something<br/>\nreasonably priced for what we could afford at the time after Karl had had a<br/>\nlot of time to experiment with the store&#39;s variety of toys.  And he was<br/>\nperfectly fine with the experience and a little something to take home with<br/>\nhim, and sometimes he actually declined taking anything home.  He&#39;s still<br/>\nlike that even at 6.  Right now I want to get him is a bike to replace to<br/>\nall the kiddie bikes he&#39;s outgrown. It&#39;s currently uppermost on my mental<br/>\nlist of things to get him.  Also I get stuff online that I know he would<br/>\nlike which are more cheaply available online.  I surprise him with it during<br/>\na lull in the midst of his other interests when he&#39;s going through a not so<br/>\ninteresting moment. :)  It&#39;s good to have those things on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 1:09 AM, Vidyut Kale &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wide.aware@...\">wide.aware@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; A friend and I were having a discussion about providing opportunities for<br/>\n&gt; our children.
