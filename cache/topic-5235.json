I LOVVVE<br/>\nTHEM - and I hate the gossip, continual chatter &quot;we talk about you/them<br/>\nbecause we love you/them&quot; and I can&#39;t take it.  My mother was 16000 kms<br/>\naway - she has now moved and brought her gossiping tongue with her to 100kms<br/>\naway.  Maybe it&#39;s time to move!<br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it - it feels like poison in me&quot;,<br/>\nthat really made me understand that I need to be clear and have a strong<br/>\nvoice to say - &quot;I don&#39;t want to get involved, and I if they want me to know<br/>\nsomething they&#39;ll tell me&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell done for being so firm!   It must serve you and bring you sanity!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did you say it btw?<br/>\n<br/>\n Love<br/>\n<br/>\nNatalie<br/>\nLove all.

(extended, not immediate). My mother and grandfather are feuding and my<br/>\nGF &quot;disowned&quot; her- it has been over 2 years now. It was hard to separate<br/>\nmyself since I am very close to both parties and live within a mile of each.<br/>\nBUT- I told them I DID NOT want to discuss the situation with either of<br/>\nthem. Put them in shock a bit since I have always been the self-deemed<br/>\n&quot;peacemaker&quot; and &quot;fixer&quot;. I just realized that if they choose to hate each<br/>\nother and be stubborn and not take any blame, they can live with the<br/>\nresults- PBLLLTHTTHT (raspberries) howz that for grown-up?<br/>\nMom says I&#39;ve gotten nasty- HEE HEE - that makes me happy to hear. OH yeah-<br/>\nwe are planning to move within the next year. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love<br/>\nthem all fiercely, I just want to go far enough away so they cannot damage<br/>\nmy girls on a daily basis!<br/>\nI also found a hidden self-confidence and self-esteem~<br/>\n I LOVED turning 30- wonder how fun 40 will be??<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the therapy.<br/>\nReenie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
