Are you on the PHEnet mailing list?  We<br/>\njust recently moved to the Olympic Peninsula, after<br/>\nyears of planning and maneuvering to get there.  We<br/>\nlove the area.  No we didn&#39;t make the Fall Gathering,<br/>\nalthough I was much looking forward to it, and planned<br/>\nto go early and help Lauren get the fire going.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband Tom was in a major car accident on the<br/>\nEastern side of the state (where he works during the<br/>\nweek) on Nov. 7th.  So the kids and I packed up and<br/>\nleft town the next morning to be with him.  We are<br/>\nstill here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis broken bones are well on the mend now and he is<br/>\ngetting around better.  So we will be trying to get<br/>\nanother commutting car for him this weekend, to<br/>\nreplace the one that was totally beyond recovery, and<br/>\nhopefully get the boys and I home in the next week or<br/>\ntwo.  We are desperate to get home, and sick of living<br/>\nat my parent&#39;s house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 16 acres of cedar woods above the shores of<br/>\nLarson Lake, North of Quilcene.  We are about 15<br/>\nminutes South of PT, and we do all our shopping at the<br/>\nCo-Op there.  I keep trying to get together with some<br/>\nof the folks from PHEnet and meet some local friends,<br/>\nbut circumstances keep preventing it.  Maybe we could<br/>\nget together after we get back into town?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11579,"nextTopicId":11544}}
