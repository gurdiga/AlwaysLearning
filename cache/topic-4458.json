But<br/>\nthey were evenly matched, too, it was never one picking on another.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when it gets not-okay, I think, when one kid has the power...<br/>\n<br/>\nI had more of a problem learning *not* to step in at every sign of<br/>\ntrouble... when I was a kid, no one ever stepped in to help me, and I<br/>\nprobably overcompensate(d).<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

Not lessons I want my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-822936750\">I was left to learn things on my own too and what I learned was that <br/>\nI was fat and ugly and deserved to have rocks thrown at my head.  Not <br/>\nlessons I want my kids to learn.  I tried to involve my parents and <br/>\nschool authorities and was basically told repeatedly that I was <br/>\nprovoking these bullies and I should just walk away.  This never <br/>\nworked.  My parents actually told me that this was these&#39;s kids way <br/>\nof trying to be my friend.  So not only was I being bullied but I <br/>\nliked it in a way because I though it ment these kids liked me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my problem is I KNOW this isn&#39;t true and I don&#39;t want to raise my <br/>\nkids that way but I have a hard time stepping in and helping my kids <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re in trouble.  It&#39;s sokmething I&#39;m working on as much as I <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In AlwaysLearning@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 2/8/02 9:27:12 AM, homeschoolmd@y... writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I wonder if Virginia would have learned to handle things this <br/>\n&gt; well if I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; had stepped in. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I learned a lot by being bullied on the schoolbus and at school <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at church <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I think I should NOT have had to learn those lessons on my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>own.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So when I heard homeschoolers making the same recommendations <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I heard <br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I was a kid in school (let them work it out for themselves) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the kids&#39; feelings first.

Organizations spend tons of money every year<br/>\nhelping grown women get away from abusive partners and yet we tell kids<br/>\nthey have to learn to work things out for themselves.  I don&#39;t know any<br/>\nadults who would think it&#39;s ok for a co worker to harass them and hit<br/>\nthem, or an employer, or a neighbor, but parents send there kids to deal<br/>\nwith school bullies all the time because it&#39;s *part of growing up.*  Well<br/>\nit shouldn&#39;t be part of growing up, ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a very serious situation brewing in our little community.  Three<br/>\nboys, the son&#39;s of a Jr.high school teacher are getting away with hurting<br/>\nkids at school.  The littlest one, a big boy actually, in second grade<br/>\nhurt a girl on the playground a few months ago.  He hit her and knocked<br/>\nher down, tried to stab her with a stick and bit on the back of her thigh<br/>\nhard enough to draw blood.   <br/>\nThese same kids have been in trouble for cruelty to animals and when the<br/>\nauthorities didn&#39;t want to do anything to them the animal control warden<br/>\nquit her job after catching them raiding birds nests and using the baby <br/>\nbirds as fishing bait.  They hung their neighbors cat from her clothes<br/>\nline.  Some parents have taken their kids out of school and others are<br/>\nthreatening to sue the school district if their kids get hurt because the<br/>\nschool is doing nothing to keep them safe.

The choices are a)Let the kids learn to deal with this on their own with your coaching in private if necessary. b) Step in and deal with the kid yourself to help your kid out.  c) Either you or your kid tell the kid&#39;s mother if things become too difficult to deal with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe times I have gotten involved have not ended in a positive way.  So obviously for me this is not my first option.  When I&#39;ve let my kids deal with things themselves, they have handled things very well and usually we just discuss things after the fact.  This has worked well in most situations.  Virginia has learned to use humor when faced with bullies.  When she was in ps some girls started ganging up on her on the play ground.  One girl pushed her into a fence.  Virginia turned to her and said something like &quot;Oh, you want to dance, I love dancing&quot; and opened her arms wide to begin the dance.  The girls just walked away.  Later this girl told Virginia she was sorry and that she just wanted to be her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if Virginia would have learned to handle things this well if I had stepped in.<br/>\nShe just has a way with people that I will never have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4510,"nextTopicId":4508}}
