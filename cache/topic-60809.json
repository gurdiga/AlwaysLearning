I was talking about a BBC TV movie version<br/>\nof The Railway Children, which I loved, and the young actress who played<br/>\nBobbie, the main character, in that movie in 2000 is the lead in Lost in<br/>\nAusten. So it was fun to come here this morning and read Sarah&#39;s suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet is perfectly amazing. This morning my 10yo asked me what kinds<br/>\nof video games I played as a kid. I told her about our Atari console. I was<br/>\ntrying to describe the Adventure game I loved so much and it occurred to me<br/>\nthat there were probably videos on YouTube, so we checked, and there were.<br/>\nThen we looked at demos of Pitfall, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and Space<br/>\nInvaders---all in those primitive graphics I remember. They were so exciting<br/>\nat the time! And today, in a different way. The sound effects stirred up so<br/>\nmany memories. I remember figuring out how to win Adventure before my<br/>\nfriend&#39;s older brothers did, and they were cheering me on. I was little and<br/>\nscrawny and terrible at sports, so that was a big moment for me--impressing<br/>\nolder kids in a *game*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s incredibly cool to be able to show my kids, within seconds, the games I<br/>\nplayed as a kid. A few minutes later, we were watching the (rather amazing)<br/>\nmating dance of the Australian peacock spider.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love living now. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Reading, why, and what (and how many times)","postDate":"1303924019","msgId":60836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0MEQzMjE1LTM3NjEtNENDNy04QzZFLUY1MTAzRkUxMjBCOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlwOHY1OCtxOWl1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwOHY1OCtxOWl1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60835,"nextInTopic":60837,"prevInTime":60835,"nextInTime":60837,"topicId":60809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-You have to watch Lost in Austen .-=- I listened to the book.

Didn&#39;t know there was a video version!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this world, and all this quick exchange of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a guest speaker for a graduate seminar at Arizona State University twice this semester, by Skype.  This morning I answered some questions from some of the students in that group, all of whom are working on masters&#39; degrees or PhDs in education.  One was about the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What do you think of free/Sudbury schools, and do you think they make it possible for children to unschool �at school�?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s still school, but it&#39;s an interesting alternative school.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t think there can be &quot;unschooling at school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative program in the Albuquerque Public Schools that&#39;s 20 years old now, called The Family School, started off billing itself as &quot;half-time homeschool,&quot; but within two years they were telling people exactly what to do with that other half a day, and having mandatory weekly meetings of all parents, and missing a meeting could lose your spot to another family.   That wasn&#39;t any kind of homeschooling.  The school was controlling and dictating to the whole family, and not just the kids.   (And they were fully double-dipping, as the kids were there either through lunch, or before lunch to the end of the day, so they got full funding for two batches of kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Also:  How do you see unschooling changing in today�s internet generation, if at all?  How do you feel about the contributions that technology has made/can make to unschooling, apart from the obvious (to us) learning benefits of videogaming?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle.  YouTube.  Kahn Academy.<br/>\nJust yesterday I watched two videos on installing a ceramic soap dish.  My kids will never feel they need to take a course in tile laying, for example.  Holly&#39;s learning guitar, and she looks at videos.  There&#39;s an online guitar tuning site (more than one), and chord sites, and sites for transcribing songs to other keys.   Marty plays drums, and there are how-to videos, and reviews of equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How do you see the SCA in relation to unschooling (one student was involved in the SCA in college, and is considering getting involved again, this time with kids)?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOur middle child, Marty, is still involved in the SCA, as is my husband.  Marty won a mask contest by making a documentable cow mask of leather, with knotwork his sister did.  They learned these things in the SCA.  He knew to check the Viking Answer Lady site, because he and his dad/Keith do Norse personas. And there are people who have learned knotwork because of Holly and Keith teaching it at an unschooling conference once, and they learned it in the SCA.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/knotwork\">http://sandradodd.com/knotwork</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother benefit from the SCA is the friends they&#39;ve had, of all ages, who have interesting knowledge and hobbies.  Marty&#39;s first job was making boots with a man who had been his dad&#39;s squire, who now lives in our old house.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nmia.com/~bohemond/Bootshop/period-page/period-boots.htm\">http://www.nmia.com/~bohemond/Bootshop/period-page/period-boots.htm</a><br/>\nHe was offered the job because he had shown himself to be interested and reliable, and because he was available and willing to work.  So the unschooling and the SCA have fed back and forth over the years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whats and whys of what people wear, do, make, sing, and eat around the SCA are learning experiences of more than just history and geography.  Lots of interpersonals and practical crafts and engineering skills.  Setting up elaborate camps of cloth and rope, for instance, is something Marty will be able to do for the rest of his life, if he wants to. :-)  He had helped many people set such camps up in all sorts of conditions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nArmored combat has been one of Marty&#39;s main sports and physical activities for the past seven years.  (Before that it was roller-blading and boffer fighting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind answering questions like these!  They can send more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Reading, why, and what (and how many times)","postDate":"1303923347","msgId":60837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVENjg2Mjc0LTkwRTQtNEIzRi1CRENELTlFRTYwMTUyREM0NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGk9UG8tTm41TExpVF9KU1VEdUdkMjM0ajdMVm5nQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwNmllaCtuaWZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MkJEQkREOTgtRTNCNC00MjcxLUJFNzMtREM3RTc3MTkzQTg4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaT1Qby1ObjVMTGlUX0pTVUR1R2QyMzRqN0xWbmdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60836,"nextInTopic":60845,"prevInTime":60836,"nextInTime":60838,"topicId":60809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Then a few days later I was doing some research for an article that I had to write on unschooling in India and -=- Who made you write an article?
