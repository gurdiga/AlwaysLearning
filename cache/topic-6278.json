I thought, &quot;I&#39;ll NEVER see him <br/>\nthen!&quot;  But he was serious so we got the ones he was missing.....he was so <br/>\neager....after they arrived, he played with each one intently for a short <br/>\nwhile....that was in February.....he is hardly on the computer at all right <br/>\nnow.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that you never really know how situations will play <br/>\nout....Imagine if you could know that they will be on the computer for a <br/>\nwhole month of the year and then hardly at all for the rest of the time - <br/>\nwould that be &#39;balanced&#39;?  Does &#39;balance&#39; mean in a day? In a week?  In a <br/>\nyear?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, look at the value in the computer game....that&#39;s what helped me <br/>\ntolerate Tarzan....I admired his persistence at the game and how he asked for <br/>\nhelp in levels that he was not comfortable with....What would happen if I <br/>\ndenied him the experience of persisting at an activity until he figured it <br/>\nout?  What would happen if I denied him the experience of working at <br/>\nsomething when the motivation was there - as opposed to &quot;it&#39;s 9am, time to <br/>\nwork...it&#39;s 5pm time to not work&quot;?.....I want him to follow his heart and <br/>\nintuition - and I can&#39;t do that if I decide for him what he &#39;should&#39; do.....<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to do what is right in each situation.....sometimes you&#39;ve got to step <br/>\naway from the big picture and look at each step....It felt right to honor his <br/>\nrequest for the computer games.....it didn&#39;t feel right to deny him something <br/>\nhe really wanted based on my own bias and concern for how he spent his <br/>\ntime....it&#39;s not all up to me.....I wanted to be respectful, and being so <br/>\nmeant finding the games.....Similarly, it never felt respectful - always <br/>\narrogant the way I did it - when I would fuss about his computer time.....and <br/>\nnow it is not an issue and I wish I had trusted him that it would work <br/>\nout.....in whatever way......<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could say that I handled it all so smoothly....I had many days of <br/>\nfrustration and &#39;it&#39;s such a beautiful day!&#39; and &#39;exercise&#39; etc etc <br/>\netc.....You &#39;should&#39; _____ .....<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yeah, one way I thought to help me through it was to join the play - I <br/>\ntold myself that I could join him for an hour of computer play - can do <br/>\nanything for an hour, right?....so I put myself there by him on the computer <br/>\nand we did have fun......<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s the computer story here.....hope you can work things out in your <br/>\nhome....<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6277,"nextTopicId":6206}}
