However, I am not so great at building my own coasters, especially those that would go inside a mountain, etc.  I am also having difficulty figuring out how to join a path to something at a higher grade, I can&#39;t figure out the platform deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched the tutorial(not enough detail), gone to the RCT website(way more advanced than I) but I need help in between.  I was wondering if any of you or your kids play/love this game and could give a newbie some assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can contact me on list or off, just make sure the heading refers to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA, <br/>\n<br/>\nsistakammi/Karen M.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  I can&#39;t wait for Dana to read so she can play this game - it has so many learning opportunities!  Math, marketing, physics and on and on - plus it is flat out fun!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1802,"nextTopicId":721}}
