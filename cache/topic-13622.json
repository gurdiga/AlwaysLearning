But, thanks for the words of advice.  I did talk to Andy about what situations he might run into at the next practice and what we could do about them.  (The &quot;bully&quot; did not show up for practice.)  And I did ask him to try one more practice and a game.  If he wanted to quit because he did not enjoy soccer, fine; but I did not want him to run from this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have since had that other practice and a game, and he is enjoying it much more.  I have decided to be more involved, and Andy decided to either avoid this girl or ignore her comments if he can.  He has a signal he created that he can use to let me know if he feels he needs me to do something. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you so much for your advice.

I would like some opinions on my (and my son&#39;s) situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (9 years old) is pretty emotional - quick to feel anger, <br/>\nfrustration and sadness, but also fairly quick to recover from these <br/>\nemotions, and quick to smile and laugh.  He just joined a soccer <br/>\nleague after never having played before.  We thought we had found the <br/>\nperfect group.  Their first five rules stress the facts that the kids <br/>\nare supposed to have fun and that parents and coaches should be <br/>\nencouraging and supportive.  There is no score kept, and no trophys <br/>\nat the end of the season. He was quite excited about this venture and <br/>\nwe had several practices in our own backyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had his first practice last Wednesday, and afterwards he told me <br/>\nhe would never go back.  He was in hysterical tears all the way home. <br/>\nSome of his issues were a bully - a girl who pushed him at one point, <br/>\ncalled him a &quot;dork&quot;, hit another kid in the back of the head with a <br/>\nball and threatened to hit yet another one later at school; he did <br/>\nnot get a chance to play goalie (all the kids wanted to be goalie - <br/>\nthe coach used rock, paper, acissors to decide); he couldn&#39;t keep up <br/>\nwith the other kids at one point; and some breathing problems (he has <br/>\na slight asmtha problem) where he had to stop to catch his breath, <br/>\nwhile the other kids continued practicing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to encourage him - maybe even push him a little - to <br/>\ngive it another try.  It seems to me there are several good lessons <br/>\nto learn here, like dealing with disagreeable people, standing up for <br/>\nyourself, realizing you have to work at something and practice to get <br/>\nbetter at it, and that you have to work with what you have got (his <br/>\nbreathing issues).  I will admit to having my own issues about <br/>\nrunning from something that proves to be unpleasant or difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking I may need to talk to the coach about this girl who <br/>\nwas giving him a hard time.  At least to make him aware of the <br/>\nsituation.  Any other advice or opinions?  Should I just let him <br/>\nquit?  Any ideas would be appreciated.<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, Camille</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13762,"nextTopicId":9083}}
