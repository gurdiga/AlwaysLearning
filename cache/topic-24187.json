I&#39;ll connect you with unschooling families (many with younger siblings) so you and your kids can start right now being a part of the local community.  It was important for me when my oldest was around your kids ages to make the homeschooling community our main group.  It was then transparent to my dd when other 5yo&#39;s were going to Kindergarten...she never felt like she missed out on a thing.  The unschooling/homeschooling world of living and learning together was her &quot;mainstream.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 25, 2006 9:45 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: : New Here<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;Just saying hello, I&#39;m new  to homeschooling/unschooling and am <br/>\n  listening in to see how it is &quot;done&quot;  IRL.
