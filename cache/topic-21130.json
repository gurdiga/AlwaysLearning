The message boards and yahoogroups are great, but I love sitting down with a book.  I also periodically send books to my ex-husband and he has actually read them.  This time I&#39;m sending him The Unprocessed Child.  I&#39;ve often thought someone should take all those posts off the old lists and put them in a huge book.  I know my ex-husband and friends will read books I lend them, but they won&#39;t spend time on the internet researching and reading at the message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nNichole<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21127,"nextTopicId":21131}}
