She doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntrust the learning or the things in the world a child might learn<br/>\nfrom, and most of all she doesn&#39;t trust her kids not to turn into<br/>\nkillers due to exposure to these things. The mother&#39;s lack of trust<br/>\nmay translate later on into the inability of the children to trust<br/>\nthemselves to be good people, and so it creates an insecurity built-in<br/>\nfor the rest of their lives. I think it&#39;s unnecessary to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure they can learn from other things, but what this means is that the<br/>\nparent filters rather than facilitates in the learning process.

If we lived on a country road on<br/>\n&gt; which the only traffic was us or people we were expecting, it might be safe<br/>\n&gt; to let a toddler cross that road alone. On a very busy, city street, it<br/>\n&gt; might not be safe for anyone to cross.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, it&#39;s important to trust that the toddler does not have ill intent by<br/>\n&gt; wanting to cross the street. The child isn&#39;t being &quot;bad&quot;. Assume there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; something interesting on the other side that the toddler wants to see, hear<br/>\n&gt; or do. Then do what you can to make it safe for the toddler to accomplish<br/>\n&gt; rather than screaming at the child, grabbing the child and spanking the<br/>\n&gt; child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A lot of parents assume ill intent for any behavior that bothers the<br/>\n&gt; parents. I think that goes back to religion and the idea of original sin.<br/>\n&gt; Everyone is born a sinner. To me, that&#39;s what Holt was getting at with the<br/>\n&gt; idea that we were taught that we couldn&#39;t be trusted. My husband thinks this<br/>\n&gt; way without even realizing it. When we&#39;ve talked about people being able to<br/>\n&gt; do what they want, he assumes they will do something mean or hurtful or bad.<br/>\n&gt; He can&#39;t fathom the idea that most people might be able to do what they want<br/>\n&gt; without hurting others. When I&#39;ve asked him if he thinks that comes from his<br/>\n&gt; Catholic upbringing, he denies it. I think it&#39;s been so ingrained into his<br/>\n&gt; thinking that he&#39;s not conscious of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not about assuming that the toddler who wants to cross a busy street<br/>\n&gt; knows when it&#39;s safe to cross. The child is new to this world and doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand that a large hunk of metal coming at a person at even 15 mph can<br/>\n&gt; be very dangerous. It&#39;s our responsibility as parents to keep the child safe<br/>\n&gt; from those things that are truly and immediately dangerous. That&#39;s where<br/>\n&gt; trust from the child to the parent comes in. Children should be able to<br/>\n&gt; trust their parents to keep them safe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Food and sleep are the other areas where I think parents have difficulty<br/>\n&gt; with trusting their children. Babies and children don&#39;t need to be taught<br/>\n&gt; what it feels like to be hungry or satisfied. They don&#39;t need to be taught<br/>\n&gt; what it feels like to be tired or well-rested. These are instinctive<br/>\n&gt; survival mechanisms that every person is born understanding. That&#39;s why the<br/>\n&gt; baby cries when his tummy hurts from hunger and roots around for the nipple<br/>\n&gt; when picked up and then falls asleep after getting his fill. So rather than<br/>\n&gt; forcing a child to eat everything in his plates at only certain times of the<br/>\n&gt; day and making him go to bed and wake up at certain times because someone<br/>\n&gt; taught you that was the right, responsible, disciplined thing to do, trust<br/>\n&gt; the child to eat when he&#39;s hungry and sleep when he&#39;s not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teenagers get a lot of flack for sleeping until noon and craving pizza and<br/>\n&gt; potato chips and soda.

Trust  <br/>\nis one of the building blocks. There&#39;s still trust left over for  <br/>\neveryone else to use. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I agree about the use of the word trust in describing unschooling.  <br/>\nI think it muddies more than clarifies. While unschooling is about  <br/>\ntrusting children, and it&#39;s obvious what people mean once you get it,  <br/>\nthe way it&#39;s expressed doesn&#39;t paint the right picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust children&#39;s wants and needs. (I&#39;ve written trust kids understand  <br/>\ntheir needs, but that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s not intellectual. It&#39;s a drive, a  <br/>\ncuriosity, biology, a hole that needs filled with something. Trust  <br/>\nthey can feel it and trust that if they&#39;re trying to meet it, then  <br/>\nit&#39;s important to them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDigging deeper into that: kids know they want something but they don&#39;t  <br/>\nalways know what it is and what will fill it. Trial and error is a  <br/>\ngood tool! By trying out things they&#39;re drawn to, they grow their  <br/>\nunderstanding of the hole, of what doesn&#39;t work, what does work, and  <br/>\nmore about themselves and the things they&#39;re trying. Being a partner  <br/>\nis good, not just in physically helping them but tapping into a  <br/>\nparent&#39;s greater knowledge and experience to help them figure out what  <br/>\nmight work and better ways to get it. We don&#39;t necessarily want to  <br/>\nhand them the solution, just help them face a more useful direction  <br/>\nand eliminate some of the things that look good on the surface but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t really offer what they appear to (like misleading cover art on a  <br/>\nbook).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust children don&#39;t want to die. But they don&#39;t always know how not  <br/>\nto. So we help them find safe ways to get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve said they don&#39;t want to hurt themselves, but we all judge how  <br/>\nmuch pain and difficulty we&#39;re willing to bear to get something we  <br/>\nwant. Different wants will be worth different levels of pain and  <br/>\nirritation. For instance, kids are plenty willing to risk scrapes and  <br/>\nbruises to master skateboarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust children don&#39;t want to hurt others. But they don&#39;t always know  <br/>\nhow not to. So we help them find respectful paths to get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust children want to be better and do better. Trust that they can  <br/>\nlearn through trying things. Those are connected. Regardless of  <br/>\nwhether a child is learning what we think they should learn from what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing, they *are* learning something that&#39;s important to them  <br/>\nright now. The thing we think they should be learning, may be worth  <br/>\nputting up with for now to get something else that&#39;s far more  <br/>\nintriguing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Trust","postDate":"1274360257","msgId":54309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3QTMzMEZFMzM4MDRGQjY4MkUwNTNDQzAyRTg1RjFGQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENCODdFREE0LUE1MkQtNDM1Qi1BRkI0LTZCQTQ3MDNBODYxQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDcxQ0VBQ0FFLTNBREEtNEUwNS04MkU0LTVGOTk4MzE2RDM0NkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEMwOUI0MTIxNkI0RTQxOUU5MEYwQzYwRjZDQTEzNDM4QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4gPEFBTkxrVGltamREUUhyVWJ5OUpuandIeFlwS0VPR0tRSUlBRlI1WUxJMlJwaEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDZDQkQ2MkIwNzY5QTRDQTRCNUE5MzFFQjVBRkU2REIzQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4gPENCODdFREE0LUE1MkQtNDM1Qi1BRkI0LTZCQTQ3MDNBODYxQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54307,"nextInTopic":54311,"prevInTime":54308,"nextInTime":54310,"topicId":54278,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"+++I can t trust that my kids will be athletes.

For, I&#39;d say, most parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents will only extend trust once a child has proven themselves<br/>\nto be able to do what they&#39;re trying to do, but if the child isn&#39;t<br/>\ngiven the chance to do things in a protective environment, the risk of<br/>\ndanger or making mistakes or getting discouraged or sneaking to do<br/>\nforbidden things when parents can&#39;t see increases. My parents didn&#39;t<br/>\ntrust me (especially my dad who got a lot of rough treatment in<br/>\nchildhood) and both told me I was irresponsible but they gave me<br/>\nlittle opportunity to prove myself. This was scary for me and I still<br/>\nlack confidence in some areas that I&#39;ve NEVER tried but wanted to<br/>\n--was *eager* to-- when I was younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic is one of those. My parents didn&#39;t think I could do music so<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t encourage it and said I couldn&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket<br/>\n(which is true because I can&#39;t hear well) but I wanted to enjoy music<br/>\nin my own way and wasn&#39;t given much chance to. It was great years<br/>\nlater when a friend who played very well handed me her guitar after a<br/>\nwhile and said &quot;Here, you play&quot; and I didn&#39;t have to even tell her I<br/>\nwanted to try! I didn&#39;t even know I wanted to at that point. My friend<br/>\njust caught a glimpse and went with it. Nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrusting children (or anyone) need not be an all or nothing deal. I<br/>\ntrust Karl a lot and help him to succeed in his goals by going<br/>\nalongside until he and I feel confident with him doing things on his<br/>\nown when he wants to. Until then, I trust his intention to do well, or<br/>\nI assume positive intention as Jeff Sabo recently put it in his blog,<br/>\nand simply go with. One benefit of that is Karl trusts me to be in his<br/>\ncorner, pulling for him, when he wants to try something. Whether he<br/>\ncan do it yet, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents mistake unschooling as an all-at-once, cut and dried kind<br/>\nof deal, there&#39;s the flip side of what I experienced. Many parents may<br/>\nnot realize how scary it is for their kids to be on their own with the<br/>\nthings they wanted to do before they&#39;re ready. Just because the<br/>\nparents were bursting for freedom doesn&#39;t mean that what their kids<br/>\nwant to do comes easy for a young person. It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t<br/>\nwant their parents to help. Maybe the parents never realized or have<br/>\nforgotten that things adults consider to be easy are more complex for<br/>\nprobably most children. This apparent &quot;trust&quot; means their kids have a<br/>\nvery conventional upbringing after all. They can call it unschooling<br/>\ntho. ;) Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example are kids whose parents won&#39;t talk much about sex and their<br/>\nkids are forced to deal with that area of their lives without their<br/>\nparents as a source of info. See how that&#39;s conventional in terms of<br/>\nhow trust is laid out in parent/child relationships? Everything&#39;s<br/>\ngroovy until something goes wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people that have a hard time with trusting because they&#39;ve been<br/>\nburned by the people in their lives, have a hard time with trusting<br/>\nanyone, including their own children. And this turns up in unconscious<br/>\nways. All of this is why most if not all parents NEED to hear that<br/>\nHoltian message of &quot;trust your children&quot; if they&#39;re going to do<br/>\nnurture the relationships within the family and build the kind of<br/>\nrapport that makes unschooling succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/19/10, Kelly Halldorson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelly@...\">kelly@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; ==&gt;I couldn&#39;t tell by that whether she meant she did find a section<br/>\n&gt; after, or that there wasn&#39;t one.&lt;==<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s the whole clarity of writing thing.

Is there one way in which all <br/>\nunschoolers use &quot;trust&quot;?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is my understanding of trust and how it&#39;s applied in real life... via a story:<br/>\n<br/>\nA new friend of Chamille&#39;s stayed the night at our house the other night.  She hadn&#39;t planned on it.  Her phone died and she doesn&#39;t have any of her phone numbers memorized to call from another phone.  John took our only working car to do some late night work about 10 or so miles away.  Chamille and her friend didn&#39;t know that John was going to do that and they had assumed that he&#39;d give her a ride home.  By the time they realized their predicament, it was after 10 pm.  This girl doesn&#39;t live in walking distance from our house, she lives about 5 or 6 miles away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking about how her mom was going to handle the situation.  The girl thought it likely that her mom might not even know that she was gone.  She was a little worried about it, but mostly didn&#39;t care.  I don&#39;t know this girl&#39;s parents at all and I probably won&#39;t ever meet them since this girl is moving back to Hawaii in about a week, to spend the summer there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said that if it were Chamille, I&#39;d be worried and that I couldn&#39;t imagine not knowing where she was in the middle of the night, but that I would try my best to assume positive intent and trust that she was ok.  Chamille responded by saying that she couldn&#39;t imagine not finding a way to let me know where she is, even if she couldn&#39;t get home late at night for whatever reason.  She went on to say that she wouldn&#39;t want me to worry and that she knew that I would be relieved and understanding about her predicament.  So even if all attempts to reach me failed, she knew that I&#39;d still be understanding and sympathetic to her situation that she found herself in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s mutual trust.  I trust that she&#39;ll do the best she can and she trusts me to be calm and considerate.  Her friend figured that at any time she DID show up, she&#39;d be in trouble with her mom, even if she showed up at 1 am, IF her mom even noticed that she wasn&#39;t at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer turns out her mom did notice.  She noticed when it was time to wake her daughter up to go to school the next morning.  There&#39;s that trust too, a kid should be able to trust that their parents are looking out for them.  Not the whole watching and waiting by the front door to make sure they made curfew, but generally being aware and connected to your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how unschooling is a bit different.  Chamille trusts that her parents are there for her, she trusts that we trust her.  We aren&#39;t out to prove her untrustworthy, like a parent waiting to make sure that their child makes curfew, but that we trust our kids to make the best decisions they can in any given moment and know that people make mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been doing that since each of our kids were small and making small choices, so that it naturally evolved to big kids making bigger choices.  Our kids aren&#39;t afraid to tell us things, they don&#39;t hide mistakes, they don&#39;t need to lie and cover up.  That helps us trust them more and it helps them trust us more because they know we are reliable to be kind and considerate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow that relates to unschooling:  If learning happens through the living, the more peaceful that is, the more learning can happen.  Trusting each other is way more peaceful than the alternative.  And more than that, if our kids trust us, they are much more likely to accept what we say and listen to us.  If our relationship was adversarial through a general distrust, we likely wouldn&#39;t have those great conversations that our unschooling life is sprinkled with, those ones that just happen and lead to great learning moments.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Trust","postDate":"1274297290","msgId":54278,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxQ0VBQ0FFLTNBREEtNEUwNS04MkU0LTVGOTk4MzE2RDM0NkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54280,"prevInTime":54277,"nextInTime":54279,"topicId":54278,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly Halldorson wrote a review of my book, and when she wrote to me to tell me where it was, there was a question. ...

I  <br/>\nthink most people use it wrong....okay maybe not wrong...just not how  <br/>\nI think of it.<br/>\nSo, I generally gloss over that when I hear it and it made me  <br/>\nthink...that&#39;s what I did when I came across it in your book<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t tell by that whether she meant she did find a section  <br/>\nafter, or that there wasn&#39;t one.<br/>\nBecause I have the word file and so can search the book, I looked.    <br/>\nOne section is called<br/>\nTrust, Free Time, Compost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s on my site, too. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/substance\">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>\nIt&#39;s about trusting the process of natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther places in The Big Book of Unschooling where &quot;trust&quot; is  <br/>\nmentioned, it&#39;s usually about the parents earning the children&#39;s  <br/>\ntrust, and about deciding which sources the parents will consider to  <br/>\nbe trustworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\npage 130, section on humor:<br/>\n&quot;Smiles and laughter involve safety and trust.  Those emotions are  <br/>\ngood for families, for relationships, and for learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n168, on eating in peace:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A little bit of plain food in a peaceful room filled with trust and  <br/>\nlove is better than the greatest food in the world choked down through  <br/>\nfearful tears.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n191, judging interests:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They will trust you as long and as far as you are trustworthy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n196, Becoming the Parent you Want to Be  (the third paragraph)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Change one thing.  Smile one sweet smile.  Say one kind thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If that felt good, do it again.  Rest.  Watch.  Listen.  You&#39;re a  <br/>\nparent because of your child.  Your child.  You should be his parent,  <br/>\nor her parent.  Not a generic parent, or a hypothetical parent.  Be  <br/>\nyour child&#39;s parent in each moment that you interact with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Somehow you will need to experiment with trust and patience, in  <br/>\nlittle ways.  If it feels good, if it seems to work, try to remember  <br/>\nwhat you did physically or cognitively to get to that place, so that  <br/>\nyou can induce it in the future....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the ways I think about trust, so I asked Kelly this, and she  <br/>\nagreed to bring it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Is there &quot;unschooling philosophy&quot;?  Is there one way in which all  <br/>\nunschoolers use &quot;trust&quot;?  I&#39;m anxious to know why you wrote so much on  <br/>\ntrust.   If you don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s used (by whom??), why are you  <br/>\nwondering why I didn&#39;t have a section on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think we should talk about that on always learning.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75983,"nextTopicId":75988}}
