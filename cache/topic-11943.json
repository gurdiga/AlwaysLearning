WERTHEIMER / The Dallas Morning News<br/>\n<br/>\nAUSTIN – The University of Texas students scribbled their names in a strange<br/>\nlanguage. The A&#39;s looked like F&#39;s, the P&#39;s resembled gibberish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were in their second day of learning Old English runes, the writing<br/>\nsystem used by author J.R.R. Tolkien to invent the languages Elvish, Orcish<br/>\nand Dwarvish for The Lord of the Rings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt UT, the tongues revived by the hit film trilogy are being used to teach<br/>\nthe millennial generation this semester. Already, students are raving about<br/>\nthe new course, titled &quot;The Linguistics of Tolkien&#39;s Middle Earth.&quot; Both<br/>\nsections of the class are full, and hundreds of students are on waiting<br/>\nlists to get in.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So far, I love it. I like the visual, seeing the runes on the board,&quot; said<br/>\nElizabeth Nelson, a 19-year-old UT senior who has three fairy tattoos. A<br/>\ntattoo of the Lady Galadriel is on her midriff. &quot;I like being able to say<br/>\nthat I know how to write my name in runes. Lots of my friends are jealous.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUT isn&#39;t alone in jumping on the Tolkien bandwagon. This fall, three<br/>\nDallas-area universities will team up to teach a literature class about the<br/>\ntrilogy for students from the University of Dallas in Irving, Southern<br/>\nMethodist University and the University of Texas at Dallas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trend isn&#39;t new. For at least two decades, some professors have taught<br/>\npopular culture classes about film and TV shows and at times faced ridicule<br/>\nfrom colleagues. The difference now is that more professors are unabashedly<br/>\nlinking movies and books their students adore with traditional, often<br/>\nweighty subjects, from physics to philosophy. Pop culture is no longer<br/>\nviewed as a nonsensical subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of connecting traditional classes and popular culture grew rapidly<br/>\nthe last five years, said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University professor<br/>\nof media and popular culture. Textbooks such as The Simpsons and Philosophy:<br/>\nThe D&#39;oh! of Homer and Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and<br/>\nNothing helped move the trend along, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;College students know an enormous amount about television, about popular<br/>\nmusic,&quot; Dr. Thompson said. &quot;If we can use that knowledge to invite them into<br/>\nother kinds of work, it&#39;d be silly not to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut professors can&#39;t simply show film clips and play sound bites of popular<br/>\nmusic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you&#39;re trying to teach Plato using Seinfeld and Simpson, that&#39;s a fine<br/>\nthing to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you never get around to reading Plato, you&#39;ve<br/>\nfailed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., students have been<br/>\nable to sign up for &quot;Beam me up, Einstein: Physics through Star Trek&quot; since<br/>\n1997. Don Spector teaches the course every other year for nonscience majors.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Spector shows bits of Star Trek episodes based on whether there&#39;s a<br/>\nphysics principle he can teach. Students, for example, watch a clip about a<br/>\ncloaking device. (Translation for nongeeks: a gadget that renders objects,<br/>\ntypically spaceships, invisible and undetectable.) Then the class talks<br/>\nabout what principles could be used to create the device.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have fun with it. I like teaching in this way better probably because<br/>\nthey are more engaged with it,&quot; Dr. Spector said. &quot;Physics always has this<br/>\nreputation of being so hard and so out there. It helps the physics to bring<br/>\nsomething that&#39;s so accessible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrical literature<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Gaines, chairman of the English department at Southwestern University<br/>\nin Georgetown, Texas, teaches a literature class based on Bob Dylan.<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not, &#39;Let&#39;s just listen to &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; 70 times and go home<br/>\nand listen to it more,&#39; &quot; Dr. Gaines said. &quot;It&#39;s a way to engage students<br/>\nwith materials they&#39;re interested in and urge them to take that a little<br/>\nfurther.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the work of Tolkien as the focus for linguistics makes perfect sense,<br/>\nhe said. The students think critically about a book they have read for<br/>\npleasure in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three Dallas-area schools teaming up for the class this fall will link<br/>\nthe Tolkien trilogy to religion, medieval philosophy and other areas, said<br/>\nDennis Kratz, a UTD professor and dean who will help teach the course.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s really happening today is the old notions of pop culture and high<br/>\nculture, except for the extremes, have blurred,&quot; Dr. Kratz said. &quot;When you<br/>\nredo La Bohéme as Rent, is that high culture or middle-brow culture?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lord of the Rings is a bit of both, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I just think it&#39;s such a very deep, satisfying, intellectually pleasing<br/>\nwork of literature, and yet it&#39;s fun,&quot; Dr. Kratz said.<br/>\n<br/>\nUT instructor Fred Hoyt, a graduate student, created the Tolkien course to<br/>\nmeet a requirement that he create an introductory linguistics class. Both<br/>\nsections of his classes, one with 30 students, one with 70, filled<br/>\nimmediately; he would have been able to fill each class 10 times over, based<br/>\non waiting lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinguistics link<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Hoyt said there&#39;s a logical connection between the famous author and<br/>\nlinguistics. Mr. Tolkien was a linguist before he was a novelist. One of the<br/>\nrequired texts in the new UT class is The Languages of Tolkien&#39;s Middle<br/>\nEarth, another author&#39;s interpretation of the invented tongues. Mr. Tolkien<br/>\nbased the languages on Old Norse, Old English, Gothic, Welsh and Finnish.<br/>\nMr. Hoyt, like many of his students, began reading the author&#39;s books as a<br/>\nchild. He said the work gave him a love for new languages, though he didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow about linguistics at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Part of the reason I wanted to offer this course was when I was an<br/>\nundergraduate, I wish I had known about linguistics,&quot; he said. &quot;In my<br/>\ndepartment, there&#39;s more focus on teaching. Linguistics is hard. It&#39;s more<br/>\nlike we&#39;re realizing we always could&#39;ve gotten to more people.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis hope is that some students will want to study the discipline after<br/>\ntaking his class.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not about the movies. The stuff we&#39;re interested in is the stuff left<br/>\nout in the movies,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents must read The Lord of the Rings and familiarize themselves with the<br/>\nappendix that explains the development of the languages. They&#39;ll study Old<br/>\nEnglish runes, but they&#39;ll also learn Angerthas Daeron, the Elvish runes<br/>\nthat Mr. Tolkien created, and Angerthas Moria, the Dwarvish runes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll talk about how Elvish sounds melodic and the Black Speech in the<br/>\ntrilogy sounds harsh.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The good guys in his book speak beautiful languages, and the bad guys speak<br/>\nugly languages,&quot; Mr. Hoyt said.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents said professors are right to find ways to connect teaching to<br/>\nstudents&#39; lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If it&#39;s interesting and relevant, you&#39;ll learn it better,&quot; said Alex<br/>\nHancock, a junior.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessors, even when they include popular film or books, are careful to<br/>\nteach in depth, said UT senior Travis Lara.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not more bells and whistles,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s more involvement with<br/>\nstudents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEric Lee, an engineering major, never intended to study linguistics until he<br/>\nsaw &quot;Middle Earth&quot; in the course title.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I saw it advertised on the front page of the UT Web site,&quot; Mr. Lee said. &quot;I<br/>\nwas like, &#39;Cool. I have to take this class.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwertheimer@...\">lwertheimer@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  DallasNews.com<br/>\n  The Archives</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11944,"nextTopicId":11963}}
