My daughter is just under 4 so I am new to<br/>\neverything as a parent.  I joined this list because I WANT to be challenged<br/>\nto explore why this thing called &quot;unschooling&quot; calls to me so deeply.  I<br/>\nthink those of us who grew up in happy stable homes and who had unique and,<br/>\nwhat would now be called &quot;alternative,&quot; school experiences are at an extreme<br/>\nadvantage when it comes time to explain why we unschool.  Just as people who<br/>\ncome from intact families are at an advantage when it comes to beating the<br/>\nstatistics of divorce, simply because &quot;non-divorce&quot; is what we know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is actually kind of funny that this discussion could be reduced<br/>\n(inappropriately, I realize) to the question &quot;Who can unschool?&quot;  Speaking<br/>\nfor my family alone, &quot;unschooling&quot; is just a name that we can use to align<br/>\nourselves with others who have made the decision that living our lives as<br/>\nfree and equal individuals is our priority, our goal, our challenge and our<br/>\ncontribution to, what we hope, is a change in society.  Looking at our idea<br/>\nof &quot;unschooling&quot; we might as well ask the question &quot;Who can live their<br/>\nlives?&quot;  I think the confidence and self-esteem needed to comfortably go<br/>\nagainst the status quo with these unschooling choices, comes from either a)<br/>\npast experiences , b) an INCREDIBLE ability to have dialogues (internal and<br/>\nexternal) about one&#39;s beliefs and goals, and/or c) the equally incredible<br/>\nability to open oneself up to possibilities that have NEVER been experienced<br/>\nsimply because one can &quot;see&quot; (rationally or with one&#39;s heart) that this is<br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea what our unschooling life will look like.  I do know that<br/>\nwhen people ask me why we are homeschooling my short answer is &quot;The goals<br/>\nand practices of institutional education do not match the goals and<br/>\npriorities we have for our family&quot;--you should hear my &quot;long&quot; answer!!! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really loving everything that is being written about this topic,<br/>\nespecially what Sandra and Pam have written today.
