In fact he and his dad <br/>\nare off playing air-soft at a big Mil-Sim (Military-Simulation) game at Fort Riley this weekend.  They will be re-enacting the battle for Pristnia in the Balkans with Albanians vs. Serbians - then NATO/European forces intervening. They re-enact military events - current since WWII.  Full military gear - not current uniforms due to safety issues of course.   There are teams form all over the region and various states. I&#39;m amazed how far teams travel to these big games.  Not all the games are big ones like the one this weekend but they still have fun. The team they are on requires you to be age 15 if a parent will play too.  However, there is one place they go that lets ages 10 and up play.  So start searching - we didn&#39;t find this place until Zac was 15 - we wish we&#39;d found it sooner as he knew about airsoft but everything we found said age 16 to join a team so he waited, joined the team and then through the team found the other place where he could have been playing all along.  There are tons of videos on You Tube of people playing air-soft.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe too worried for years that he&#39;d join the military as soon as he could.  But you know, now he says he does not want to join the military - just loves all things military.  All aspects of war - he knows / loves learning about all aspects of war, the history, the economic causes of certain wars, the economic impact of wars, social impact and causes, how inventions of warfare advanced civilizations; how new weapons and the various art forms of warfare then led to civilian uses, various types of history surrounding military; how a fluke weather phenomenon changed the course of a battle/war.   It is like Military and Warfare are the umbrella that fuels everything else for him - and his love of all things military fuel an extremely wide range of interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe letting him live his passion and immerse himself in it has satisfied him to the point of not feeling a huge desire to join up?<br/>\n<br/>\nCeltic, Roman, Viking, Norse, Scottish, Napoleonic, Shogun, Arabic, Ancient Egyptian (Pharos), European Middle Ages, Knights Templar, Crusades, Samurai, American Revolutionary Way, American Civil War, American West, other wars involving the USA, the list never really ends really.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads to interests in just about everything else - Presidents, Kings, rulers, political, physical geography, Celtic/Roman/Norse/Greek mythology - the Gods had some great battles; he has made chain male; carved swords from wood, worked with flinging, made dioramas, plotted, drawn and written battle plans, made home &quot;war&quot; movies, <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few of the shows he has enjoyed - most are on the internet: Hogan&#39;s Heroes, MASH, McHale&#39;s Navy, F-Troop, any old John Wayne war movies, Well any old war movies - he went through a period of loving old westerns - anything with a great shoot out.  We get a channel called The Military Channel and The History Channel is great too.<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer games that are first person shooter, military strategy games, I&#39;ll ask him when he gets back home for suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought him fatigues when he was little to wear.  Sometimes it was just the pants and a T-shirt, hats, dog tags, patches, pins (like a tie tack or hat pin)  He put those all over the lapel of his coat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep our eyes open for things like:  air shows - it was expensive but we went to an air show and he got to ride in a WWII fighter plane; when he was about 5 we were in AZ and he got to fly in a Bi-Plane; usually at the air shows there are all types of military vehicles on display; military museums tucked here and there as we travel (they are often very small but suits the desire); a lot of the military bases have museums that are really good; there is usually some type of Civil War re-enactment each year around here - great cannon shots; we have the WWI museum and memorial; sometimes there are Military educational semi-trailer trucks that travel around and park in malls and the kids can go through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has fallen in love with 40&#39;s era big band & swing music.  He loves the movie Master and Commander which led to a love of various classical music.  The other day I came home from work and opera was playing very loudly - go figure!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has taken Hap-Ki-Do; fencing; and a couple of other &quot;fighting&quot; art forms;  Military cadence drumming; <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo Halloween&#39;s ago he made a Samurai costume for himself and a horse at the stable where he takes riding lessons.  Every year since he was 3 his costumes are about some type of military something or other.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting together military vehicle models were an interest for a while.  Collecting the tiny GI Goe size military guns.  Remote control military vehicles.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor facts he watches a lot of shows and movies and then asks questions and we look things up - now he looks things up himself a lot.  He often has the laptop right next to him as he reads and / or watches something on TV - which often leads to watching something on-line.  You Tube is about the best place I know of to get footage.  Most You Tube footage is done to a song/music.  We often have a great laugh as Zac has a great sense of humor - he found a funny video from the 50&#39;s done to the song &quot;Battle of New Orleans&quot;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsRK3DNoa_Q\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsRK3DNoa_Q</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get info on just about anything on You Tube - Zac is a visual person and loves You Tube.  The samurai costume he made was gotten from You Tube, he figured out how to make Japanese rice balls to eat this week through You Tube;   He spends hours entertaining himself and us with You Tube and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am saying that as we live our lives and go along we find opportunities everywhere connected to Military because we are aware of his desire for that connection.  Some things we actively hunt and other opportunities seem to appear as that is where our awareness is focused.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LsRK3DNoa_Q?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for Army/Military play","postDate":"1284314657","msgId":57256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFQTIzQzM5LUVBNjktNEY4MC1BOEYwLTY4MkZBMTk4MDNDQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluNmNiYTNlcjlOaHpvbU9QeVpLPS14RmRuc3VtOEFuemt1NzhTNUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluNmNiYTNlcjlOaHpvbU9QeVpLPS14RmRuc3VtOEFuemt1NzhTNUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57253,"nextInTopic":57258,"prevInTime":57255,"nextInTime":57257,"topicId":57253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"While he s looking around and researching, maybe he can interpret these, some (maybe all) of which were my dad s near the end of WWII.

I think the first  <br/>\nwriting was on the AOL homeschooling message board, and that is long  <br/>\ngone.<br/>\nThere was a mom who wrote and said &quot;My kid doesn&#39;t care about anything  <br/>\nin the world but WWII. He doesn&#39;t do anything but draw pictures of  <br/>\ntanks and draw pictures of airplanes, and draw maps. He knows all  <br/>\nabout WWII. He doesn&#39;t know anything else. And so I, that was when AOL  <br/>\nwas new so that was years ago. And that was the first time anyone ever  <br/>\nput one of those to me, like tell me how. You know &quot;Prove it. Put up  <br/>\nor shut up.&quot; And I said, &quot;Ok.&quot; So I just started spinning a thing  <br/>\nabout WWII, you know about how much it tied in. If he knew how they  <br/>\ngot food to those people and how they were exchanging information,  <br/>\nhow .. you know... why were those guys there? what were their  <br/>\nmotivations for being there? he would have the same kinds of questions  <br/>\nabout every other thing. He would understand other wars and projects  <br/>\nif he understood that. You know, you have to get food to people. They  <br/>\nhave to have a place to sleep. They have to have some clothes. They  <br/>\nhave to have some water. You know who thinks about that with the war?  <br/>\nBut he did. That kid did. That kid knew everything. He was just huge  <br/>\ninto the logistics about who was where and why and how. How can that  <br/>\nnot tie into everything, including music?
