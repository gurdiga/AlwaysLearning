I&#39;m guessing not, you&#39;ve learned new things along the way and found different &quot;grooves&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m working on changing something about myself it helps me to think about how I learn. It can take time and practice for something new to become easy rather than a struggle and usually I have a sort of &quot;plateau&quot; in my learning right when I know what I want but have to struggle my way there each time. The past few days I&#39;ve been learning new crochet stitches and feeling it there, but its true with thoughts and reactions, too. I&#39;ll jump to my old reaction, catch myself, fumble my way to a better choice, and reassure myself that its all part of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of unschooling isn&#39;t necessarily to form better grooves, though, depending on what you mean by that. It&#39;s good when you realize that your knee-jerk reactions are kinder than they used to be - that&#39;s a better kind of groove. It&#39;s good when you find you can think of more alternatives quickly, too. Those are things that take practice but get easier. So if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking, then Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut kids don&#39;t stay the same, so you can&#39;t depend on just falling into some kind of parenting groove where you always say the same things and get the same reaction. There aren&#39;t any &quot;once and for all&quot; solutions because kids change and situations change. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting a little off the specific topic, but sometimes when parents ask &quot;when am I going to get in a groove?&quot; they already have one, it just isn&#39;t very comfortable because mom is expecting a groove or routine or flow to look a certain way. I&#39;m thinking about young children and transitions, in particular - its not uncommon for a toddler to go through a rough patch with transitions, where most transitions are just plain hard for the child. While there are ways to make transitions easier, &quot;easier&quot; is also relative. Soothing a crying child is a better transition than getting frustrated at a crying child. Picking up a crying, overwhelmed child gently and carrying him home may be better and easier on the child if it allows him to calm down someplace safe. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":233098946,"authorName":"Lisa E Biesemeyer","from":"Lisa E Biesemeyer &lt;l.biesemeyer@...&gt;","profile":"l.biesemeyer@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] difficulty with choices","postDate":"1304527060","msgId":61048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg0MzIwNy40MDY5MS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg0MzU2NkY1LTU3NzgtNDQ3NS05Nzc5LTkzOUI1NjNFRUNGRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlwcGFjait2MnA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QTVCMDg0Q0MtMjhFMS00REQ2LTg5MTgtRjgxMTQwNTRGMTI5QHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8ODNEOUVDOUUtM0FGNC00NzA4LUIzQ0ItNkQ1NzkyOEIzNTYyQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8QkFOTGtUaW1ITEt6V0F6bmdVVWF3UTN2VTV4UURnNDliWVFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw4NDM1NjZGNS01Nzc4LTQ0NzUtOTc3OS05MzlCNTYzRUVDRkVAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61045,"nextInTopic":61053,"prevInTime":61047,"nextInTime":61049,"topicId":61005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you re hiking with a less experienced hiker who s counting on you to  be the more experienced partner, when you re on flat ground it s fine to  passively","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2016146522\">&quot;If you&#39;re hiking with a less experienced hiker who&#39;s counting on you to  be the <br/>\nmore experienced partner, when you&#39;re on flat ground it&#39;s fine to  passively let <br/>\nhim lead.

Choir practice is in a separate building so my husband will sometimes take the two little ones with them. My 4 year old has taken her DS and played with it while her big sister is practicing. If the 2 year old goes, they will run around outside and play with rocks and dirt. Whether it is all or nothing usually depends on how my husband is feeling. <br/>\n<br/>\nActual church is different. My husband has taken the 4 year old if he is feeling good and the 4 year old is well fed, well rested, and having a good day. He has also chosen to take one of the little ones if he thinks they will go to sleep. Also, we give our 6 year old a say in whether or not she wants her little sisters to go to church with them because the 2 little ones can be very distracting. If they do not go with dad and sister, I try to find something fun to do at home such as make cookies, get out a game, or go for a drive. Since my husband has the option of Saturday night church or Sunday morning church, he will often choose Sunday morning so that he and our 6 year old can go to church and be back before the two little ones ever wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie                                                                                                    <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] difficulty with choices","postDate":"1304453795","msgId":61016,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExQ0QwMkIwLTczRDItNEQwOC1BRkFCLTZGNEU5N0E2NDhEN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4NEVFRjMyMzBDQjQ0ODM5RjE4MzlDQzVGMTZGNjlBQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwcGFjait2MnA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Qzg0RUVGMzIzMENCNDQ4MzlGMTgzOUNDNUYxNkY2OUFAQ29ubmllUEM+"},"prevInTopic":61015,"nextInTopic":61020,"prevInTime":61015,"nextInTime":61017,"topicId":61005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- My 6 year old has recently decided to go to church with her dad and has joined the church choir.

It can be hard to choose between two things that you don&#39;t want to do. It sounds as if his only options were stay home or go to the yoga center. In those cases, I try to offer a third or fourth alternative that my kids will probably want to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;This week I thought his ambivalence might have come from thinking about the rules and expectations the group has.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he is only 3, he probably doesn&#39;t remember the rules and expectations. His ambivalence may come from the fact that he is only being given two choices and neither of them are very appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m going to continue to offer the group to my son and as the summer wears on I&#39;m going to try maybe to just attend the after group activities. My worry is that I should be doing more to help him feel confident. Maybe if I was more confident? I do feel defensive about our lifestyle sometimes and there isn&#39;t a lot of external validation for it in the community we live in right now. Are we doomed to be social pariahs? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why are you so caught up in the group? If you really want to do yoga, then find a time to do yoga when somebody else can be with your son. I have found that continually being offered something feels like pressure. If I tell somebody that I don&#39;t want the piece of chocolate (or whatever it is) they are offering and they continue to offer it, I get a little annoyed. First off, I feel like nobody heard me. Second, I feel like there is no choice because I know I will continue to be badgered (even if it is a sweet, continual offer) unless I take whatever it is that is being offered. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Last night again he cried about missing his friends in the group. How can I help him? We discussed it several times the day before and he got ready quite eagerly. I wonder if he&#39;d wished I&#39;d &quot;taken charge&quot; and taken him to the group.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you are in the mindset that it has to be the group or nothing. What about finding a different group with different friends? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But in the meantime, how do you support a three-year old in making choices, changing his mind, and then sometimes missing out on an opportunity? How can we learn to enjoy opportunities that aren&#39;t perhaps a perfect fit while we try to find more suitable ones?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A three year old has a very limited world view. They change their minds a lot. I have found that my little ones would rather stay home and play something engaging with me than go out and have to navigate social situations. They love to go shopping or to the park too. It doesn&#39;t have to be an organized group. I have spent the morning playing Insaniquarium with my 2 year old and 4 year old and they absolutely love it. I am writing this while waiting to kill aliens. Whenever we have gotten stumped looking for something that is a better fit, we tend to retreat from the groups and find fun stuff to do on our own. An engaged mom (or dad or other adult) that will sit down and play with a young child goes a long way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if the opportunity is truly enjoyable, it won&#39;t matter if you get to be yourself. It won&#39;t matter how &quot;suitable&quot; it is. My 6 year old has recently decided to go to church with her dad and has joined the church choir. Personally, it is not something that I would have thought of but she decided to join her dad one day and now she refuses to miss. She has to behave and can&#39;t run or talk or be her boisterous self but that doesn&#39;t seem to bother her because there is something that she enjoys about it that makes it all worth while. My younger two will sometimes ask to go with my husband and 6 year old. Most of the time, we say no because we know that they are not capable of sitting quietly for an hour or so without disturbing others. It doesn&#39;t matter how much they want to go. I know that it is beyond their ability. If your 3 year old is not capable of following the rules at yoga class, then consider finding something else to do until he is capable of following the rules and expectations. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: difficulty with choices","postDate":"1304447726","msgId":61010,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwcGh0ZSt1cjdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5RjAzMjA1LTg3RDYtNDlFNC1BNTBBLTdBOEM5MDBERURDMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61008,"nextInTopic":61012,"prevInTime":61009,"nextInTime":61011,"topicId":61005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He may want exciting things planned for him so all he has to do is go.-=- I agree!

At one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-7749461\">The other morning my son and I must have walked between the yoga center and our house about eleven times.  He was unsure whether he wanted to go or not. At one point, when it was too late to enter the group, we returned home and he was very upset, hitting our house and saying he hated it and crying passionately. He wanted to see his friends. The children all called his name when he arrived last week and clustered around him.  Also, later this summer the group will be doing outside events like picnics and so I do want to cultivate this as an opportunity for us.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt terrible going home and missing the group but couldn&#39;t risk a similar fit at the natural parenting support group after so much going back and forth about attending. We couldn&#39;t walk back and forth between our home and the yoga center all day. Finally I just took him home. There is a massage room and chiro office in the building and it is quiet. We&#39;ve enjoyed the group in the past but the children are expected to be a little subdued, sitting and playing quietly, so moms can meet and talk. My son liked  the group, we discovered it after an chiro appointment. He heard children&#39;s voices in the yoga center and we went upstairs to investigate. The week after we went back. It went all right but the expectation was voiced that he would eventually learn the rules and be quiet, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis week I thought his ambivalence might have come from thinking about the rules and expectations the group has. I had to remind him of these expectations, which are also voiced by the groups leader. For example, we have to leave &quot;Batman&quot; at home, which means both the batman persona and the cape cannot come. We can&#39;t take any toys which cause him to get over-excited. Though it is subtle, I feel my son&#39;s choices are not supported.  For example, many of the parents in the group want to shield their children from &quot;commerical characters&quot; like batman. No one in the group has said we could not bring our toys but my son cannot play with his action toys in the atmosphere of the group. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am confirmed somewhat in my analysis by my son this morning when we went to the same building for chiropractic. He wanted to take batman and several other figures, almost as though to say, &quot;where they are not welcome, neither am I.&quot; (I am finding other places where his choices are validated. Last night we stumbled across a video from a comic shop where they introduced the new themes.  My son listened with rapt attention to the entire video cast and I could see he was excited to hear about characters and other trivia that was familiar to him.  Especially as the panel was all adults taking the subject quite seriously.)           <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to continue to offer the group to my son and as the summer wears on I&#39;m going to try maybe to just attend the after group activities. My worry is that I should be doing more to help him feel confident. Maybe if I was more confident? I do feel defensive about our lifestyle sometimes and there isn&#39;t a lot of external validation for it in the community we live in right now. Are we doomed to be social pariahs? <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night again he cried about missing his friends in the group. How can I help him? We discussed it several times the day before and he got ready quite eagerly. I wonder if he&#39;d wished I&#39;d &quot;taken charge&quot; and taken him to the group.  I do feel he would enjoy the group if he could be himself. We walked back and forth (it&#39;s not far) as he changed his mind. I let him change his mind multiple multiple times if he wishes. Each time we changed directions I supported his choice. But eventually I had to take him home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have written a short piece on the subject of choices. I will post it separately.
