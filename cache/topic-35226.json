Then, they can, or you can, put the drop into the indentation beside the eye close to the nose.  Put the two or three drops needed in that eye and then they can, slowly, open their eyes, allowing the drop to go into their eye... they can control it, open the eye slowly, and it is a more respectful way for drops to to gin.  repeat in a few minutes for the other eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlexx has had six surgeries on her eyes, and eye drops on a regular basis, both for exams and also for infection and also before and after each surgery, and this is how we do it.  Her doctor taught us, and he said it was a more gentle way to get the drops in.  It&#39;s very scary to have your eyes open and the HUGE looking bottle coming up to your eye, it&#39;s very much a loss of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, breastmilk 3-4 x a day, 2-3 drops per eye, for 10-14 days, will also cure pink eye.  I did that with my husband when we didn&#39;t have insurance, years ago, and also with my own daughters... it also can help with stuffy noses, and, well lots of other things...
