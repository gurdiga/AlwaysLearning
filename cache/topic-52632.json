Right now my daughter is on her way to pick up mozzerella cheese and pizza dough at the local store on her bike.  And she is SO happy to be doing this.  She has been asking to walk there for a few days and I have been afraid to let her go because I worry about her going by herself.  I have been thinking on this alot as I do usually find ways to meet my kids wants/needs.  This took me a few days to feel okay about.  Today she offerred to go to pick up the items we needed and suggested she ride her bike so she can go faster as the store will be closing soon (she had already called to check the time the store closed and that they had what we wanted to buy).  I thought about it and agreed and she was ecstatic.  I said yes because I realize that she will likely be safe and fine and it means so much to her to go by herself.  To help me feel better, she agreed to call me after she checks out so I know when she is on her way home (she just called) and to walk her bike across the street and in the parking lot.    Anyway, I totally agree that helping our kids to do what they want (whether emotional or physical or both) is so important and fosters a great relationship.
