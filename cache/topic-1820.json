He <br/>\nis excessively fond of creatures which he would call cuddly pets and anyone <br/>\nelse would call fearsome monsters. Hagrid&#39;s appearance is very intimidating, <br/>\nbut his disposition is kind. <br/>\n<br/>\nHagrid attended Hogwarts, starting in 1940. When he was a student there, he <br/>\nwas falsely accused by Tom Riddle of opening the Chamber of Secrets and <br/>\nreleasing a monster. Hagrid was expelled. Albus Dumbledore, then the <br/>\nTransfiguration Teacher at Hogwarts, arranged for him to stay on as <br/>\ngamekeeper. In 1993, his name was cleared through the efforts of Harry Potter <br/>\nand his friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nHagrid was not allowed to do magic before his name was cleared, although it <br/>\nseems that his broken wand was somehow imbedded in his pink umbrella and he <br/>\ndid cast a spell or two. Now he is allowed to do magic, but as he was never <br/>\nproperly trained, he&#39;ll always be somewhat inept at it (SN). <br/>\n<br/>\nHagrid, Rubeus <br/>\nhair: long, wild tangled black hair and beard <br/>\neyes: glinting like black beetles, crinkled in a smile (SS4) <br/>\ndistinguishing feature: he gives the impression of being &quot;too big to be <br/>\nallowed&quot; <br/>\nHouse: Gryffindor (BN) <br/>\nfield: Care of Magical Creatures <br/>\ntitle: Keeper of the Keys and Grounds (SS4) <br/>\nhome: one-room wooden hut on the grounds, near the Forbidden Forest <br/>\ninterests: magical creatures, the more dangerous the better, drinking, <br/>\ndragons <br/>\nborn: 1929, human father and giant mother <br/>\npet: Fang, the boarhound (in 1942: Aragog, an Acromantula) <br/>\ntimeline <br/>\n1929 born to giant mother, Fridwulfa, and a human father <br/>\n1932 Fridwulfa abandons her family <br/>\n1940 starts Hogwarts <br/>\n1942 father dies <br/>\n1943 falsely accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, expelled and given <br/>\ngamekeeper position <br/>\n1981 rescues baby Harry from ruins of his parents&#39; house, delivers Harry to <br/>\nPrivet Drive <br/>\nJuly 31, 1991 takes Harry to buy his things for Hogwarts <br/>\nspring 1992 hatches a baby Norwegian Ridgeback dragon <br/>\nMay, 1993 sent to Azkaban for a few weeks <br/>\nJune 1993 name cleared after fifty years <br/>\nfall, 1993 given the job of Care of Magical Creatures teacher <br/>\nOctober 30, 1994 meets Olympe Maxime <br/>\nsummer 1995 visits the giants of the north <br/>\n<br/>\nHagrid&#39;s pockets <br/>\n<br/>\nHagrid commonly wears a huge moleskin overcoat with many pockets.
