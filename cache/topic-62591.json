We do try and look behind his behaviour  but will often <br/>\n&gt;&gt;point out that we understand but the choice wasn&#39;t a  good one and a better one <br/>\n&gt;&gt;could have been xxx.  For example, he was  given some headphones recently.  His <br/>\n&gt;&gt;sister has been using them in the  back of the car when we go out to listen to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;her ipod.  Yesterday he  destroyed them and she was very upset.  They had a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;yelling match, and  when I stepped in calmly he said he didn&#39;t care that he <br/>\n&gt;&gt;upset her  because he wanted to because she was &#39;evil&#39;.  Later my wife spoke to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;him  and he said he did it because he didn&#39;t want her listening to the ipod  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;instead of talking to him.

Given <br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve described I don&#39;t think your son will fathom what you are trying to <br/>\ndo. You will do much more for him and for his siblings and for yourself to be <br/>\nkind to whomever got caught in the moment when he couldn&#39;t make himself clear <br/>\nand to be kind to him. Recognise that she took his headphones, whether with <br/>\npermission or not. Recognise that he couldn&#39;t communicate well enough that he <br/>\nwanted her not to use them in that moment and destroying them became the easiest <br/>\nway for him to solve that problem. Look bigger than your fear that he will <br/>\nalways be too angry to cope with the world. Look smaller as well. Look at your <br/>\nson and see him as he is, not in comparison with other people, with other boys <br/>\nhis age. He isn&#39;t anyone else. You can&#39;t convince him to be someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of a parent&#39;s perspective is wanting their children to all like each other, <br/>\nto all get along. Let go of that. It isn&#39;t within your ability to make your <br/>\nchildren like each other. Don&#39;t expect more of any of your children than they <br/>\nare capable of giving/doing.

I am going<br/>\nto make some general comments, really just providing some questions that you<br/>\nmay want to explore with yourself and your wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy immediate thoughts are that if you are trying to get a message through to<br/>\nsomeone that you care about (like a parent, who should be helping get your<br/>\nneeds met) and it isn&#39;t getting through, it is VERY frustrating.  Humans,<br/>\nyoung or adult, often get angry when they are frustrated.  There is even a<br/>\nvery scientific sounding theory called the &quot;frustration-aggression<br/>\nhypothesis&quot; that has been supported by a lot of research.  How is<br/>\nfrustration dealt with in your family?  How do you deal with frustration?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you figured out how to LISTEN to your son in a way that allows him to<br/>\nfeel safe, accepted and valued?  Has he become what therapists like to call<br/>\nthe &quot;identified patient&quot; of the family?  If this has happened, then your son<br/>\nwill become the eye of the family hurricane.<br/>\n<br/>\n A family is a unit and everyone impacts everyone else, for good or for<br/>\nill.  How does your behaviour impact your son, wife, other children?<br/>\nChildren tend to learn most by seeing what adults do and then modeling that<br/>\nbehaviour.  What behaviour of yours are your children modeling?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last comment is about ritalin.  Many children do not respond well to<br/>\nritalin.  Many times if a child is nearing puberty it can contribute to<br/>\nrageful, out of control, seemingly psychotic behaviour that is really very<br/>\nscary.  If it is not helping, then I would contact the prescribing physician<br/>\nand demand that he/she give me a schedule to back him off of the ritalin.<br/>\nYou should not just cease giving it to him, because it can cause problems if<br/>\nit is suddenly stopped.  Ritalin is a very powerful stimulant that can<br/>\nheighten normal frustration, aggression, anger, etc. into frightening<br/>\nepisodes.  Ritalin can also have long term effects on cardiac health that is<br/>\nvery worrying.  This isn&#39;t condemnation of medicating children, but there<br/>\nare always risks and gains to be weighed with all meds, even an aspirin or<br/>\ntylenol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a family full of people with diagnoses of ADHD (attention<br/>\ndeficit-hyperactivity disorder) and a few that probably would qualify for a<br/>\ndiagnosis.  Most of us did not have good results with ritalin.  A few had<br/>\ngood response to ritalin, while learning other coping strategies like<br/>\nbio-feedback, meditation, and breathing exercises.  I used simple<br/>\nmeditation  and breathing exercises with my children to help them maintain<br/>\ncontrol, when the environment was too stimulating.  Also, we often left a<br/>\nplace if it was too overwhelming for either child, or turned off the tv, or<br/>\nswitched to a new activity or got out of the house, or whatever else would<br/>\nhelp.  It wasn&#39;t always easy, but now that they are teens, they are very in<br/>\ncharge of themselves.  Development goes a long way towards helping a child<br/>\nlearn to cope, as well.  Try to see the behaviour of your children on a<br/>\ncontinuum of development of coping ability and skills.  Some of us are more<br/>\nsensitive and more easily set out of kilter and less able to calm down<br/>\nquickly.  Then, ask yourself, if this could just be a trait, instead of a<br/>\ndiagnosis waiting to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children were small, my son was easily overstimulated and easily<br/>\nupset by any small thing.  It took a while for me to realize that I would<br/>\nget very upset (and them angry) at his discomfort.  I would then get a look<br/>\non my face and react badly, even though I thought that I was being nice and<br/>\ncomforting, I was being angry and belittling.  I had to search myself and<br/>\nfigure out that when my son had these reactions, I took it to mean that I<br/>\nwas failing to do a good job as a mom.  I took it personally.  I had to<br/>\nrelearn to take a deep breath and smile.  To see this behaviour for what it<br/>\nwas, a developmental hiccup, that he and I would grow through.  I also<br/>\ninstead focused on what worked for him and then manipulated the environment<br/>\nso that it was something that he could cope with.  We stayed out of crowds<br/>\nfor about 6 months.  My mother, who could grasp that children deserved<br/>\nrespect, would watch my son when I had to go shopping.  When I came home, he<br/>\nwould have had a marvelous time with Nan and then help put the groceries<br/>\naway, an activity that he really enjoyed.  Also, I came to realize that my<br/>\nson needed a great deal of alone time to decompress.  When I learned to<br/>\nrespect his desire to play alone sometimes and encouraged him to express his<br/>\nneeds and then respected them, he felt more able to control his own<br/>\nenvironment and so had less reason to act out.  Sometimes doing nothing,<br/>\nrequiring nothing and expecting nothing is the best route.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Aug 30, 2011 at 12:51 AM, The Pommies &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thepommies@...\">thepommies@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I am a dad to a 9 year old boy who I believe has some issues that need<br/>\n&gt; help with.

She&#39;s 7 now, but we first began to be concerned when she was <br/>\naround 4.  We made the mistake of taking her to a psychologist, and though <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t get any formal diagnosis, I&#39;m sure some could have been applied if <br/>\nwe had pushed!  Instead, the psych suggested normal methods of time out etc <br/>\nto deal with the problems we were experiencing (at the time, hitting us, <br/>\nourbursts etc), which in the long term only made the problem worse!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest change we&#39;ve seen in our daughter&#39;s behaviour has been since <br/>\ndiscovering unschooling about 18 months ago.  In my experience, the <br/>\n&#39;gentler&#39; approach of seeing our daughter&#39;s behaviour as expressing her <br/>\nneeds rather than as bad behaviour, and actively helping her look for ways <br/>\nto meet those needs, has made huge changes in her behaviour.  Any attempt to <br/>\ntry a firmer hand or any dicipline measures has only made the situation <br/>\nworse, and thus taken longer to recover from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although his hearing is now fine, his speech is ok, he doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\n&gt; great vocabulary and he isn&#39;t a very good<br/>\n&gt; communicator so that definately is an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter talked early, and has a large vocabulary of words, yet she still <br/>\nhas a lot of trouble expressing herself in regards to anything emotional.  I <br/>\nhave had to guess what is bothering her many times, and try to clarify with <br/>\nher later when she has calmed down.  When she&#39;s emotional, she simply cannot <br/>\ntalk about it, so we&#39;ve found it best to just sit with her and wait until <br/>\nshe&#39;s calmed down, and even then, to only express any concerns (such as not <br/>\nhitting people), in the simplest way possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; His biggest problem with friendships is he doesn&#39;t seem to be aware when <br/>\n&gt; he is being too rough with others - friends,<br/>\n&gt; sisters, and us.  He gets excited and wants to wrestle, which we do with <br/>\n&gt; him too, but he doesn&#39;t seem to get that he is<br/>\n&gt; hurting others and when we point it out he screams and yells that he <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t care and that we ruin his fun.  He wants<br/>\n&gt; us to not stop him so he can carry on wrestling, despite the fact that the <br/>\n&gt; other person is hurting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter needs a great deal of physical activity.  A trampoline has been <br/>\na lifesaver for us, as has a swing.  Lots of wrestling with my husband and <br/>\nI, with gentle reminders if she&#39;s hurting us, has helped imensely, and she <br/>\nnow seems a little more aware of her own body movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, we get angry if she accidently hurts us, she gets quite <br/>\ndistressed, and shuts down, I believe this is because she is just so upset <br/>\nat having hurt us that she can&#39;t deal with it.  As you have described with <br/>\nyour son, she will scream and yell at us if we point out that she&#39;s hurt <br/>\nsomeone and try to make it into a lesson on what to do.  For us, a simple, <br/>\n&quot;Ouch, that hurt&quot;, or asking to stop for a moment if necessary, has been far <br/>\nmore effective at helping her know when she&#39;s hurting someone than making a <br/>\nbig deal out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When Joyce said to try and meet his need rather than highlight his &#39;bad&#39; <br/>\n&gt; choice that resonated with me.  We do try<br/>\n&gt; and look behind his behaviour but will often point out that we understand <br/>\n&gt; but the choice wasn&#39;t a good one and a<br/>\n&gt; better one could have been xxx.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He was making the best choice he could think of to get his needs met at the <br/>\ntime. Instead of focusing on making him understand that his choice was bad, <br/>\nit is more helpful to look at other ways he can get his needs met, and if <br/>\npossible, to help him meet them.  If he has an alternative that works more <br/>\neffectively at getting those needs met, then he will be more likely to <br/>\nchoose that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know that he feels controlled and limited by me (although in <br/>\n&gt; conventional terms he has a huge amount of freedom).<br/>\n&gt; Mainly this is to do with my need to have a clean and ordered house.  I <br/>\n&gt; &#39;ask&#39; him not to spray water in the bathroom, &gt; not leave food in his <br/>\n&gt; room, not take drinks in the lounge, for example and he gets very angry. <br/>\n&gt; He says, &#39;you care so<br/>\n&gt; much about cleaning - more than you do me&#39;, &#39;you are obsessed with the <br/>\n&gt; house&#39; etc.  I have started to back off from<br/>\n&gt; saying these things and turning a blind eye to messes he is creating, but <br/>\n&gt; it is so hard for me as I am quite houseproud.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We had to let go of these expectations quite early on.  My daughter hated <br/>\nsitting at the table to eat, and hated even us sitting at the table to eat. <br/>\nShe wanted to play.  So we got rid of our dining table, and now we all eat <br/>\nin front of the TV (which is what DH and I did before our daughter was born, <br/>\nbut for some reason we thought we should sit at the table once she was old <br/>\nenough!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found it really hard to let go of the idea of not making a mess.  DD <br/>\nloves to play with water at the sink, mix up mixtures of flour, then sift <br/>\nthem, or play with other similarly messy substances.  I&#39;ve learnt that if I <br/>\ncan work with her with this, find ways that she can play with less mess <br/>\n(putting down a towel underneath what she&#39;s doing for example), then she is <br/>\nso much happier, and the mess rarely takes as long to clean up as I thought <br/>\nit would!  Sometimes I have to step away and let DH do these messy <br/>\nactivities with her if I really can&#39;t watch, then I step in to clean up <br/>\nafter it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a post a few months back that really resonated with me, and helped <br/>\nmove me past one of my sticking points.  I think it was about a child who <br/>\nhad been diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder, and someone made the <br/>\ncomment that a child can&#39;t be defiant if they had nothing to be defiant <br/>\nagainst.  At first I thought of all the examples in my head of when my <br/>\ndaughter had been defiant over nothing, but as I did, I realised that in <br/>\nactual fact, in each example, she was reacting to a &#39;rule&#39; that was so <br/>\ningrained in my head that I didn&#39;t even realise it was there!  And most of <br/>\nthose ideas were so silly and pointless, that to be honest I can&#39;t even <br/>\nremember an example.  Once I realised this, I was able to let go of another <br/>\nlayer of &#39;shoulds&#39;, and we&#39;ve been much happier since.  I think perhaps I <br/>\nneed to do that again, as we&#39;re going through another difficult stage right <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been quite a journey for me, and one I wouldn&#39;t have even embarked <br/>\nupon if my daughter had responded to more conventional parenting, and for <br/>\nthat I&#39;m constantly grateful.  Reading here on the list for the last 18 <br/>\nmonths has made such a huge shift in my thinking that I find many of the <br/>\nideas I previously held as pointless.  It isn&#39;t an easy shift, especially <br/>\nnot if you had a very conventional upbringing (I didn&#39;t), but it is well <br/>\nworth it in the long run for both the happiness of your kids, and for your <br/>\nown happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Advice Needed About Son","postDate":"1314759419","msgId":62623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4MzE3NjcxLUQ0QUEtNEQzQS1BQzk1LUNFOTNDNjZDNjAwRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGozazRtdCtvM3Q2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGozazRtdCtvM3Q2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62621,"nextInTopic":62624,"prevInTime":62622,"nextInTime":62624,"topicId":62591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- She seems to be playing constantly and it comes naturally to her.

His biggest problem with friendships is he doesn&#39;t seem to be aware when he is being too rough with others - friends, sisters, and us.  He gets excited and wants to wrestle, which we do with him too, but he doesn&#39;t seem to get that he is hurting others and when we point it out he screams and yells that he doesn&#39;t care and that we ruin his fun.

Setting aside my mental template of how fathers and sons are supposed to behave with each other (the kind of things you see on TV around Father&#39;s Day, for example) and allowing my son to reveal himself to me, for want of a better way of describing it, has been awesome. He&#39;s nothing like I was at 16, he&#39;s not much like I am now, and I couldn&#39;t be happier. And the fact is, he&#39;s not like teenage boys who have gone through the school experience - especially the high school experience. It&#39;s kind of spooky, and it&#39;s even more wonderful. But it does take an attitude of attentiveness without imposition. Observation without comment a lot of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, if you&#39;re &quot;The Pommies&quot;, are you a British ex-pat living in Australia? I&#39;m from London originally and live in Canberra (I became an Australian citizen in 2004).<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Advice Needed About Son","postDate":"1314741602","msgId":62614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozam1oMitqdW9lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGozaHE4bSs0NWN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62613,"nextInTopic":62616,"prevInTime":62613,"nextInTime":62615,"topicId":62591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** I had another thought about this, which is that kids who are hard of hearing sometimes have a lot of anger at their families.

Try to answer that question (in your own mind if you don&#39;t want to answer it here) without being dismissive. So if he seems to be angry because he wants more attention, don&#39;t think &quot;just wants attention&quot; think of it as a real, pressing need and look for ways to meet that need. <br/>\n<br/>\nParents sometimes become dismissive when children are extremely  energetic, or struggle with frustration, or disappointment or seem to need a lot of &quot;control&quot; (which may mean independence or may mean a sense of personal power) but those are real issues *and* there are ways to help your son depending on what his needs are. So its important to try to work out Why he&#39;s getting angry so you can figure out how to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lately he has talked about how he wants to kill or hurt his siblings and me, has been purposely urinating in his room, breaking his own stuff (including a $1,000 tv), and generally being very verbally and physically aggressive. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s desperate for some kind of help and is using everything he can think of to get it. If he&#39;s not angry with mom, look hard at what she&#39;s doing and do it, too. Do more and better of what&#39;s working! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be one of the reasons you&#39;ve been resisting giving him what he needs is that he needs so much more than his siblings and you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s not fair. It&#39;s not fair that your son is now in such a state of collapse - not to him or anyone else in the family. &quot;Fair&quot; isn&#39;t the same as equal. It helped me, when my stepson was younger and needed sooooo much to step back and think of how much I would give, unquestioningly, if his needs were purely physical. It might help you to ask &quot;how much more time/attention/support would I give if he were seriously injured?&quot; Don&#39;t disregard his needs because they&#39;re psychological. <br/>\n<br/>\nAssume he is doing his absolute best with the resources at his disposal. When he&#39;s falling apart, his resources are way too low. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am also so worried that he actually needs additional professional help( enabling both sides of the spectrum) and we are doing him a great disservice by not getting it for him.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nBy professional help do you mean drugs or some kind of therapy? The tricky thing about changing multiple things at once is that it&#39;s much harder to know what&#39;s working. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of what you decide, I&#39;d recommend keeping a journal First where you keep track of what&#39;s going on when things are going well and when they&#39;re going badly - its important to do both! You want to know what works just as much as what doesn&#39;t! Under the circumstances, its a good idea to keep track of things like food, too just to be sure its not something simple like a food sensitivity! A journal may be enough to help you figure things out on your own - but if not, it will be helpful for a therapist or doctor, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Advice Needed About Son","postDate":"1314721016","msgId":62600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdGMTc5OUU3LTczQjMtNDNGOS1BQjdFLUM1MENENzc1RkU3MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGozaWttdSttY2swQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGozaWttdSttY2swQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62599,"nextInTopic":62613,"prevInTime":62599,"nextInTime":62601,"topicId":62591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-And the author also talks about when it is appropriate to seek outside professional help, and what that should look like (ie. not just prescribing drugs).","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1443678408\">-=-And the author also talks about when it is<br/>\nappropriate to seek outside professional help, and what that should look<br/>\nlike (ie. not just prescribing drugs).

It gives a very nice perspective on<br/>\nall of the &#39;problems&#39; you described, which professionals can turn into<br/>\nillnesses, but are actually just short delays in development, that<br/>\nparents don&#39;t recognize.

On the other hand, his method of<br/>\nproblem-solving almost exactly mirrors how I have been solving<br/>\ndisagreements here, so its fairly close to the principles I try to live<br/>\nby while we unschool.

The less you need to stop him the better!) But move quickly  <br/>\nfrom focusing on his solution to focusing on his need. If you make  <br/>\nyour goal him trusting that you want to meet his need, he will  <br/>\neventually trust that stopping what he&#39;s doing is part of meeting his  <br/>\nneed.  (If your focus for the past 9 years has been on teaching him  <br/>\nhow wrong his solution is, it will take longer for him to trust that  <br/>\nyour stop means &quot;Let me help&quot; rather than &quot;You&#39;re bad.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can describe some of the incidents, experienced radical  <br/>\nunschoolers will be able to see an even bigger picture that takes even  <br/>\nmore factors into account -- like the radical unschooling principles  <br/>\nof respecting the child, of being the child&#39;s partner -- and offer  <br/>\nsome more complex solutions, less direct path solutions, that allows  <br/>\nyou to meet the need *and* maintain the principles of radical  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not dismissing what you&#39;re saying about his rages. (Though the  <br/>\nless he has to rage about the better!) Other radical unschooling  <br/>\nfamilies have faced similar situations with rages. Hopefully they&#39;ll  <br/>\ncome along with some ideas :-) but in the meantime if you search for  <br/>\n&quot;rage&quot; in the archives, that will bring up some past discussions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":479071493,"authorName":"Lena","from":"Lena &lt;lenayim@...&gt;","profile":"sayslena","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Advice Needed About Son","postDate":"1314686165","msgId":62596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODY4MkFFLTRFMEMtNDM3NS1BMjQzLUQzMTBGRDM4MTVERkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGozaHE4bSs0NWN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGozaHE4bSs0NWN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62595,"nextInTopic":62597,"prevInTime":62595,"nextInTime":62597,"topicId":62591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Mike, Sorry your family is undergoing struggle and some hard times.

I think a psychological evaluation would help tease out whether this is an emotional, environmental, or biological issue, and then give you guys some ideas on how to begin to help your son. Of course all psychologists are different, so you&#39;d want to interview and speak with each to be sure that he/she understands your son, your family, and beliefs and lifestyles. I am not sure who is prescribing the ritalin  (physician v. Child psychiatrist?), but it does not seem to be a good match with your son and may be exacerbating issues for him. You may want to consult with whomever is prescribing this and discuss taking him off of it until a psychological evaluation can be done. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a child mental health counselor, and when a child is destructive,impulsive, angry, and talks about hurting themselves or others, it is usually a good time to bring in some outside support so that you guys can function as a family better, and help your son feel less anger. Also, to be frank, you dont want him to accidentally or impulsively hurt himself or others in a moment of anger. That is just my opinion, i am sure others will have more. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nLena<br/>\nwSent from my iPad<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 29, 2011, at 9:51 PM, &quot;The Pommies&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thepommies@...\">thepommies@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a dad to a 9 year old boy who I believe has some issues that need help with.
