My husband works for a cell phone company, codes and develops smart phone apps, films and edits video, and has played video games his whole life. One of the big things we had in common was our love of the film industry. We own close to 1,000 movies and TV shows and have always had the TV on as background noise, which didn&#39;t change much once we had our daughter. We *want* her to be exposed to lots of different types of media, TV and film included.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if we&#39;re home, our TV is usually on. We don&#39;t have cable, but we have Netflix, Hulu, and a hard drive full of content, plus all our hard copies. Our daughter didn&#39;t pay any attention until about 8 months, and even then, she was far more interested in books until just after she turned 1. She still LOVES books. She also loves music. Sometimes we switch the TV over to Pandora and dance. She loves titles to TV shows (the intros that play the music or theme song). No matter where she is in the house, she will run in to dance just to that part, and then go back to whatever she was doing. We don&#39;t use the TV as a babysitter - we are watching it with her and usually playing, reading, doing puzzles, stacking blocks, doing crafts...you name it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat for long car trips too - we have a few movies loaded onto the tablet that she can watch. But guess what? Sometimes she&#39;ll say no to the tablet and ask to listen to music instead (her current favorite is dubstep). Yesterday, she just wanted silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest arguments that I heard from friends regarding the AAP recommendation were that TV programs were over-stimulating for their developing brains, and that a child who watched TV before 2, especially as babies, had a smaller vocabulary than those who didn&#39;t. Problem is, my daughter has a LARGER vocabulary than most of her peers. And she understands far more than what she can speak. I don&#39;t know if I can credit digital media for that, but it certainly didn&#39;t hurt it. I do know that she&#39;s picked up on certain actions or skills by watching them on the TV. She&#39;s learned dances too - several times she&#39;s busted out a dance move that I recognized from Yo Gabba Gabba.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now she&#39;s really into the Tinker Bell movies, and since watching she&#39;s pointed out birds and leaves and all sorts of nature things by name when we&#39;re outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s a glimpse into our household. There&#39;s a lot of stuff that my child has learned from what plays on the television.

Although certain television programs may be promoted to this age group, research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant caregivers (eg, child care providers) for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the statement is that it assumes that interaction with people and TV watching can&#39;t both exist in a child&#39;s life. For unschoolers there should be both. And often both at the same time :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is often the case with these general statements, they&#39;re trying to get a clear message to those who are on the low end of the attentive parenting scale. They&#39;re speaking to parents who are attentive and responsive to their kids and to parents who stick their kids in playpens while they watch adult TV programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be a whole lot clearer to say little kids need lots of positive and joyful interaction with with parents to grow up whole. But then they&#39;d feel the need to put some number of hours on it for the parents who would interpret it as 60 seconds being enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one of the statements from the page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Although several studies suggest age-appropriate programs can help preschoolers learn language&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So the studies focus very narrowly on language. What can be studied will end up seeming more important than what can&#39;t be studied. But natural learning is *very* hard to pin down. If a study can only judge how well a child is assembling a jigsaw puzzle by how many edge pieces they put together, the study ends up dismissing the center pieces that support and make the edges meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heavy viewers in this age group [4-6 yos] spend an average of 30 minutes less per day playing outside and eight minutes less per day reading than children who are not heavy TV watchers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are they watching? Kids programs? Or is &quot;watching&quot; being in front of the TV while parents watch?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they watching kids programs with their parents? <br/>\n<br/>\nPBS does ask the question whether the kids are watching more TV because they can&#39;t go outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband runs programs for blind kids which draws from very poor areas of Springfield MA. He&#39;s been in several of their homes to pick up the kids and he says, despite their poverty, they have really nice TVs and computers. For one thing, these are caring parents who made the effort to contact the blind program for their kids. The second thing is that the media is to keep the kids home and off the not so nice streets they live on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Programs that are well designed and take into consideration children&#39;s developmental stages are more likely to have educational merit than shows not geared toward their healthy growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This statement is both a &quot;duh&quot; and speaks to the fact that some kids are growing up in homes where the TV is on adult programming all day and to homes where adults use kids programs to keep their kids entertained and homes where TV is chosen based on the child&#39;s interests. Can any general and meaningful conclusion be drawn about the effect of TV when what constitutes TV and the relationship between parents and kids is so broad? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why what unschoolers find with their kids is more meaningful than general statements about &quot;all&quot; kids. &quot;TV&quot; among radical unschoolers means TV that the kids enjoy with parents who are attentive to their kids&#39; needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; According to a recent study conducted by a group of scholars and <br/>\n&gt; published in American Behavioral Scientist, the television is on <br/>\n&gt; approximately six hours a day on average in American homes. <br/>\n&gt; Yet little is known about the impact of growing up in the near <br/>\n&gt; constant presence of television.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And the findings will be different depending on the relationship between child and parent. But that won&#39;t make it into the study. It will be about factors that numbers can be applied to. And those factors that can&#39;t be measured -- like closeness, attentiveness, warmth -- won&#39;t make it into the study. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: TV/DVDs and under-2s","postDate":"1351706539","msgId":69555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOUGZYcURMWGhBQjI3elpLVVdzeE9WQmM2ZFFzRDJVUzZacE9Vek9qZFk4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs2cm9scytlYW9tQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMTIxMDMxMTQ1MzAxLkdPMzA0MzlAdGhlLmVhcnRoLmxpPgk8azZyb2xzK2Vhb21AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69554,"nextInTopic":69556,"prevInTime":69554,"nextInTime":69556,"topicId":69545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Learning ABCs?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a massive amount of learning your child has done in just 8 months that&#39;s invisible. When Kat was 12 mos. I wondered out loud where her hat was. And she pointed right at it. She not only remembered where I&#39;d casually placed it, but understood what I&#39;d said even though she wasn&#39;t speaking yet. There was some complex learning that was behind that. It wasn&#39;t just one thing but loads of little and big things that were important to her. But not important to some test giver ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s way too much focus on do x and child will learn x. Natural learning doesn&#39;t work like that. It&#39;s a little bit of x. It&#39;s a little bit of y. It&#39;s a lot of z. It&#39;s an &quot;aha!&quot; moment inside the child that sees a connection between all 3 that makes x more understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is at 2 (or 3? maybe someone can confirm) that many kids go through a stage of wanting to see the same thing over and over and over. With Kat is was 101 Dalmations. There&#39;s definite learning going on there to be that fascinated! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYour child&#39;s engagement will be the best indication of whether your child is learning or not, not a bunch of experts -- not even us! -- who have never met your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV/DVDs and under-2s","postDate":"1351701515","msgId":69546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1QzI5MjBFLTZGNkQtNEM5Qi1BMTlCLURFQzVCQzA1M0RDQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMTIxMDMxMTQ1MzAxLkdPMzA0MzlAdGhlLmVhcnRoLmxpPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMTIxMDMxMTQ1MzAxLkdPMzA0MzlAdGhlLmVhcnRoLmxpPg=="},"prevInTopic":69545,"nextInTopic":69548,"prevInTime":69545,"nextInTime":69547,"topicId":69545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My understanding of the AAP publication on the matter is that children under about 2 just don t learn much/any from TV.-=- Do you want us to challenge or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-439188450\">-=-My understanding of the AAP publication on the matter is that children<br/>\nunder about 2 just don&#39;t learn much/any from TV.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want us to challenge or defend a position put out by a medical association in one country?
