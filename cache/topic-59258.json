Now,  we could <br/>\nrethink her musical activities, but as she enjoys what she does there  and has <br/>\nsome quite long-established friendships there (which were a  point of sanity <br/>\nwhen school was becoming an endless source of stress) we  thought it&#39;d be <br/>\nbest to leave well alone ...

She was always more likely to have her nose in  a book or a video <br/>\ngame than climbing a tree, so perhaps it&#39;s to do with her  nature.  But if <br/>\nwe&#39;ve never fully stepped outside of the academic way  of thinking, how <br/>\nautonomous is it?

She does really enjoy  what she does and she seems to have a <br/>\nclear idea of what she wants.

No parent knowing a child was having a horrible reaction to medication would make him finish the rest of the bottle just because it was already paid for.  No one would say &quot;Don&#39;t be a quitter&quot; about donuts or health-risking medicine.

It&#39;s practically a guarantee.  Compared to the number of kids in school who would rather be involved in music or sports than not, there are almost zero opportunities for real-life application of those skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time when every church and every Sunday School class needed someone to play the piano, but now many churches have audio-visual screens with the music playing and the hymn lyrics scrolling (or they have electric guitars).  If a city is large enough to maintain an orchestra, or a musical theatre company with live musicians, the performances are rare, and the musicians are drawn from all ages of a large population.  Even if a single high school district somehow kept an orchestra of their best-of former students, the &quot;student population&quot; of all years in the past would be much larger than a static moment of a three- or four-year institution.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschooling kids&#39; parents are involved in theatre or music or sports.    More are not.<br/>\nANY parent who does not, himself, actively participate in performances or competitive sports or martial arts or dance should probably not even think about forcing or pressing and unschooled child to do that.

None did I stick with for longer than a single session (sometimes one, sometimes a handful of classes). And my mom never pushed me.

I wanted to be good at something like so many of my friends were. But she was adamant that she didn&#39;t want to push me into anything, that it felt wrong to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd somewhere through my 20&#39;s, I figured some things out, and I started pursuing things I really wanted to do. Lo and behold, I got really good at some things! I&#39;m a very good knitter. I&#39;m a very good gardener. I&#39;m a very good baker. I&#39;m a very good writer.

I got a lot of criticism from my inlaws for<br/>\n&gt; allowing the boys to try out and then quit one sport/activity after the<br/>\n&gt; other. Now they are doing taekwondo, because they asked to do it and wanted<br/>\n&gt; it intensely (they did it for a year 3 or 4 years ago). They love the<br/>\n&gt; uniforms! Well, two weeks into the membership one of them doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>\n&gt; much anymore, and influences the other so sometimes he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; either. My husband and I don&#39;t like to let them quit since it was their<br/>\n&gt; idea, and they do really like it - it&#39;s transitioning and getting out of the<br/>\n&gt; house that&#39;s the hard part. Once they are there it&#39;s all fun and they get a<br/>\n&gt; lot out of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find it difficult to find the balance between encouraging them to go and<br/>\n&gt; not force them. My husband thinks we need to apply some pressure because we<br/>\n&gt; all know how fun it is once they&#39;re there... I don&#39;t like to force them at<br/>\n&gt; all. But I give them my opinion, what I know, that they are having fun there<br/>\n&gt; and meeting other kids. One of the rules at taekwondo is to commit to at<br/>\n&gt; least 2 times a week. Other rules are that they have to say &quot;Yes, sir&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Yes, m&#39;am&quot;, bow, and pay attention to what the instructor says. They have<br/>\n&gt; no problems with this in class, just *getting to* class!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And then I reread Sandra&#39;s words:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;If you keep putting him in programs and classes, you&#39;re not giving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling a chance to work its wonders in your family. For some reason,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you keep quitting unschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to quit unschooling, and I don&#39;t want them to quit taekwondo<br/>\n&gt; (at least not the first month). It&#39;s also a problem between my husband and I<br/>\n&gt; in how to deal with this, he prefers action and decision making (he liked<br/>\n&gt; parts of what the &quot;tiger mom&quot; wrote and thought she had a point about<br/>\n&gt; persevering and learning through practice). And he would love to see them<br/>\n&gt; *do*  SOMETHING because that&#39;s what everybody else does. All the other<br/>\n&gt; (schooled) kids are good at *something* ours don&#39;t excel at anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I remember well how it was growing up with a controlling father who forced<br/>\n&gt; me to do activities I didn&#39;t care for, I&#39;m more willing to accept my<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s choices and not forcing them. I&#39;m not competitive and I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care if the neighbors&#39; kids are great athletes, and play instruments well.<br/>\n&gt; Their mom yells and threatens and spanks. I am happy that we have a better<br/>\n&gt; relationship here.

I didn&#39;t write clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Just because someone pays to have a child in a class, or with a one-on-one teacher, that doesn&#39;t make that person &quot;the boss.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If someone pays to come to a conference to hear me speak, that doesn&#39;t make them the boss--not even a shareholder--in what I say or do while I&#39;m presenting.---<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t literally say &#39;boss&#39; to her, and I should have been clearer.  I don&#39;t assume that as an unschooler I can tailor other people&#39;s interactions with my children.  The class was nearly empty, the other two children had dropped out.  She was already just playing in the water, but there was some pressure to put her head under, or let him take her to the deep-end and practice kicking.  I judged that in that particular situation is was appropriate to ask for changes, if she would want me or her to.  I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with a child or parent asking an instructor to do something a little differently.  They can always say no, or the child can leave the class if it doesn&#39;t work for them.  I was offering her ideas/possibilities... she chose the option to leave.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In a group situation such as a swimming class, or music or art or anything else physical and easily disrupted, for one child to say &quot;My mom says I don&#39;t have to do this&quot; could disrupt the whole thing.---<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe she sensed that and that&#39;s why she wouldn&#39;t say it... I suspect it was just her shyness.  But she was already resisting the instructor&#39;s pressure to do the swim lesson stuff, not letting him pull her into deeper water, anyhow, just playing on the shallow steps, and it didn&#39;t seem to bother the instructor.  He only had 3 kids to start, and at her last class she was the only kid who showed up. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than the option being for a child to say &quot;My mom says I don&#39;t have to do this,&quot; I was imagining a child or parent speaking with the instructor about their discomfort with some aspect of the instruction.  Teacher&#39;s seem (in my experience) to like some feedback and discussion about how much enjoyment a child is getting from a class, or what they might like done differently.  Thats not the same as demanding changes, or expecting special privelages.    <br/>\n<br/>\n---Unschoolers don&#39;t gain special privileges in the world.  My kids have mentioned before that it seems to them some unschoolers get (or are explicitly given) the idea that they are unschoolers now, and the rules don&#39;t apply to them anymore.  WRONG!  Their parents can change things around at home, but their authority doesn&#39;t extend past that, or their own interactions with their children.---<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely realized this early on.  When my father or brother or sister are with them, I can&#39;t ask them to do what I would do.   The same goes for instructors in classes we go to.  I don&#39;t think we have special privelages... and I do think we need to go along with the rules and courtesies of the places and situations we are in (or leave if not).  But I also think that there is room to ask for change, in many situations.  <br/>\n <br/>\n---If a parent wants to find a play-partner or informal instructor, the thing to do is to ask the questions in advance, before money is discussed, and not assume that a pre-designed group situation will be customized for one child just because her mom&#39;s philosophy has changed.---<br/>\n<br/>\nWith city classes, which we can afford, this can&#39;t be done.  Its an automated sign up system, and you don&#39;t know the instructor until you show up.  Its a big city with many community centres.  Also, I didn&#39;t assume she wouldn&#39;t want to swim the way they designed the class.  She really wanted to go to a swim class... so she went, with my help in signing up.  It wasn&#39;t what she thought it would be.  Nothing lost. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that in any situation where there is an &#39;instructor,&#39; we&#39;ve signed up, and my child says she wants to be there, it would be appropriate to speak to the teacher if something wasn&#39;t working well for my child.  If the teacher says &#39;no,&#39; maybe because the change would be disruptive for the other children, then ok.  But that may not be the case.  It might be fine. I don&#39;t see a problem with asking. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- So, its nice to know that those hours are filled with something interesting that she loves to do, while I learn how to strew during the rest of our time. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n--- I don&#39;t think you can learn to strew while she&#39;s not there.  IF she&#39;s having fun, then great, but if you really want to move to unschooling, being with your daughter and helping that relationship blossom into something glorious is what it takes.  ---<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t write that sentence clearly.  I meant that during the rest of our week I am actively creating a fun life for us, working on doing that better and more all the time.  Her drama class is there because she wanted and enjoys it.  During the time of the class, I can have some one on one time with the 2 year old as well, and if he&#39;s sleeping, I can go up to the library and browse, or go have a quiet cup of coffee.  I&#39;m not studying strewing while she&#39;s in a class.  I agree with what you wrote, Sandra, in order to make our relationship grow, and strewing grow, we have to be together... and we are, almost always.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In the &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch&quot; model, it sounds like you&#39;re wanting to read a lot, while they&#39;re in classes.  I could be wrong, but if your kid are thinking in ANY way that those classes are the reason they&#39;re learning, and those things couldn&#39;t have been gathered other ways, that could be a problem. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nThe classes are fun for her.  She enjoys herself and wants to go.  I don&#39;t think of it in educational terms... its more arts and crafts, story time, singing, etc, in a group with other kids.   Its just one more fun thing to add to our week, one more interesting experience that we could let go of if it weren&#39;t interesting or joyful anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, if someone put their child in a &#39;Creative Playtime&quot; class (which is somewhat like a preschool class) in order to &#39;make sure&#39; their kid was learning at least something, while they learn about unschooling, that wouldn&#39;t make much sense at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another thought, but I&#39;m going to post it seperately, in a minute. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira Rocklin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Classes, camps, programs, workshops, etc.","postDate":"1296248843","msgId":59300,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrS2dhMVBrRXEtZUJpVEJWTEpUbng9djA1dktSTkplc0drZm1vZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlodjh1ditlNDRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlucDkyc25kYVZyMlpYNDFZTHRmd3VUOGY3WnlnNnlLdms5Vk45REBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPGlodjh1ditlNDRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59299,"nextInTopic":59303,"prevInTime":59299,"nextInTime":59301,"topicId":59258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There it is and if the intro for it should be re-worded let me know: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=166856207674&v=wall ~Katherine ...

But dont have to pay for the ones she misses.   The woman that teaches the class is very laid back and nothing is absolutly required of the kids as far as writing is concerned.  It is really just a time to get together with other kids that are writing with the tools to write and draw. My oldest son took the class at one point and he liked it for awhile.  Then he quit.  There was an expectation to draw or write or look at books, they couldnt just go and play anything in the house and disrupt the workshop.  But there was no pressure to be at a certain level, write if you didnt want to etc..  <br/>\nHe didnt write much that I remember but he drew alot of pictures.  He liked the stories she read and he enjoyed seeing his friends there.  He quit after awhile.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Classes, camps, programs, workshops, etc.","postDate":"1296238660","msgId":59291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlodjE4NCtpaTViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMDlZTm9fdXZ3bXI5b3c4UkpkRldLZVBUVlkwYVZ6UzFBV2dYYkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59289,"nextInTopic":59293,"prevInTime":59290,"nextInTime":59292,"topicId":59258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What would help those transitions? Can you set things up so everything they need is in the car and all they have to do is get in? Can they bring games or whatever along in the car? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; I don&#39;t want to quit unschooling, and I don&#39;t want them to quit taekwondo<br/>\n&gt; (at least not the first month).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually dropping the class is a different issue. Is there a chance that one or both the kids needs more time at home? Can you cut down Other outtings so that the one day out in the week is taekwondo? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought is - are you equating wanting to miss a class or two here and there with &quot;quitting&quot;? Plenty of adults drop in and out of classes, and kids classes often have a high degree of redundancy in them. Would it really hurt anything to go every other week? <br/>\n<br/>\nYet another thought is to ask if you can pay by the class, knowing your kids are only up for a 3 or 4 week run of classes rather than 8 or 12 or whatever the classes run. Some teachers don&#39;t like that - it costs them money, after all, when people drop - but others are okay with it. Depending on the studio, maybe you can ask friends for their &quot;guest&quot; passes and use those to let your kids take just a few classes at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;One of the rules at taekwondo is to commit to at<br/>\n&gt; least 2 times a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Woops, didn&#39;t see that before - twice a week could be a big part of the problem, honestly.

He could spend long stretches of time in a day involved with Pokemon stuff: action figures, videos/dvds, find-the-Pokemon books, looking through the Pokemon guide, playing Pokemon games, puttering around with Pokemon art, putting together his Pokemon &quot;dream team&quot;, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been passionate about video games since he was, gosh, 3 or 4 years old; now he&#39;s 12-1/2. That passion has blossomed into a variety of directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that passion may not necessarily happen for your kids for what you currently consider &quot;an activity&quot;. Re-define &quot;activity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===My husband and I don&#39;t like to let them quit since it was their idea, and they do really like it===<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t let them quit when they express a desire to do so, they may quit coming to you with their ideas of things they&#39;d like to try. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve taken taekwondo before so they know what to expect. When they took it before, it sounds like that was before you began unschooling (&quot;they did it for a year 3 or 4 years ago&quot;). So maybe they didn&#39;t have the option to quit at that time, or maybe they enjoyed it and didn&#39;t want to quit until they&#39;d been doing it for a year. Maybe they&#39;re more comfortable now, now that you&#39;re unschooling, expressing their desire to quit. Maybe what they expect from the class is different than what they expected 3 or 4 years ago, and it&#39;s not meeting their expectations this time around.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps they like parts of it, but not so much that they&#39;re especially excited about going. Maybe what they&#39;re doing at home is more fun than taekwondo. Why penalize them for that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Once they are there it&#39;s all fun and they get a lot out of it.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that your opinion, or have they actually said it&#39;s all fun and they get a lot out of it???<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking is that if it&#39;s &quot;all fun&quot;, they&#39;d not be wanting to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===All the other (schooled) kids are good at *something* ours don&#39;t excel at anything===<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that sentence is just full of &quot;all or nothing&quot;-ness.<br/>\n<br/>\n*ALL* of the schooled kids are good at something???

Once they are there it&#39;s all fun and they get a lot out of it.===<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I read your post, I chatted with my 12-1/2 yr old, always-unschooled, son about it. As a kiddo who&#39;s been able to try out classes and quit if he wasn&#39;t getting what he wanted out of them, I wanted his feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s taken acting classes a couple times. He took a beginner&#39;s class when he was 8 or 9 and loved it. It was a small class, he had a couple friends in the class, and the instructor made the class fun and interesting and he interacted well with the kids (my son&#39;s opinion, but I caught the end of a couple classes and thought the same thing).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then took the next level up class. The class was about twice the size as the beginner&#39;s class, he didn&#39;t know anyone in it, there was a different instructor who, according to my son, spent most of the class time trying to get the kids to pay attention (&quot;herding cats&quot; is the phrase that comes to mind). In a month&#39;s time, my son went from looking forward to going to the class, to dragging his feet about going, to not wanting to go at all, at which point we let the instructor know my kiddo wouldn&#39;t be back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a year later, my son wanted to try that second class again. But it ended up being the same situation: overly-large class and the instructor spent much of the class time trying to keep the kids corralled and paying attention to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was annoying for my son because he *wanted* to be there, he *wanted* the class to be enjoyable rather than the instructor having to spend his time babysitting kids who really didn&#39;t want to be there. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a big gamer. When he&#39;s interested in doing something away from home, he may game right up until it&#39;s time to leave, but he will voluntarily stop what he&#39;s doing when it&#39;s time to leave home. It&#39;s worth it to him stop. (This is what he told me tonight when we were discussing this topic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something&#39;s not as interesting, much like the second acting class became, he&#39;d rather keep doing what he&#39;s doing at home. That&#39;s a pretty good indicator for me that he&#39;s interested in whatever the away-from-home plans are: if he stops what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s interested in going; if he keeps saying, &quot;in a minute,&quot; and &quot;in a minute&quot; drags on and on, he&#39;s not especially interested in stopping what he&#39;s doing to go do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it may be that, yes, your sons enjoy aspects of the class, but overall the class isn&#39;t so enjoyable that they&#39;re wanting to stop what they&#39;re doing at home to go to the class. That was my son&#39;s feedback about this particular part of your post.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have a few other things to add, but this reply&#39;s getting long so I&#39;ll wrap this one up and start a second one.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139171607,"authorName":"Katrine Clip","from":"Katrine Clip &lt;katrine@...&gt;","profile":"kaclip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Classes, camps, programs, workshops, etc.","postDate":"1296200162","msgId":59280,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMDlZTm9fdXZ3bXI5b3c4UkpkRldLZVBUVlkwYVZ6UzFBV2dYYkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlocW5uaCs1cGJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlocW5uaCs1cGJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59273,"nextInTopic":59281,"prevInTime":59279,"nextInTime":59281,"topicId":59258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been thinking of this too: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-440562869\">I have been thinking of this too:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;... a fear a mother had that her child who left an enrichment program<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would adopt habits of not finishing things and become &quot;a quitter,&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have been unschooling for a year now, and my 9 year old boys can&#39;t stay<br/>\nwith any activity for long. I got a lot of criticism from my inlaws for<br/>\nallowing the boys to try out and then quit one sport/activity after the<br/>\nother. Now they are doing taekwondo, because they asked to do it and wanted<br/>\nit intensely (they did it for a year 3 or 4 years ago). They love the<br/>\nuniforms! Well, two weeks into the membership one of them doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>\nmuch anymore, and influences the other so sometimes he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\neither. My husband and I don&#39;t like to let them quit since it was their<br/>\nidea, and they do really like it - it&#39;s transitioning and getting out of the<br/>\nhouse that&#39;s the hard part.

But I give them my opinion, what I know, that they are having fun there<br/>\nand meeting other kids. One of the rules at taekwondo is to commit to at<br/>\nleast 2 times a week. Other rules are that they have to say &quot;Yes, sir&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Yes, m&#39;am&quot;, bow, and pay attention to what the instructor says. They have<br/>\nno problems with this in class, just *getting to* class!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I reread Sandra&#39;s words:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;If you keep putting him in programs and classes, you&#39;re not giving<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling a chance to work its wonders in your family.

It&#39;s also a problem between my husband and I<br/>\nin how to deal with this, he prefers action and decision making (he liked<br/>\nparts of what the &quot;tiger mom&quot; wrote and thought she had a point about<br/>\npersevering and learning through practice). And he would love to see them<br/>\n*do*  SOMETHING because that&#39;s what everybody else does. All the other<br/>\n(schooled) kids are good at *something* ours don&#39;t excel at anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember well how it was growing up with a controlling father who forced<br/>\nme to do activities I didn&#39;t care for, I&#39;m more willing to accept my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s choices and not forcing them. I&#39;m not competitive and I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare if the neighbors&#39; kids are great athletes, and play instruments well.<br/>\nTheir mom yells and threatens and spanks.

We&#39;ve done classes on and off, but they are usually what would be considered &quot;extra-curricular&quot; classes. I have asked them if they would like to join a co-op which those that attend say is very fun, but because it is structured much like school, they have no interest in attending. They loved their swimming class just because they love being in the water. Then I enrolled them in gymnastics. They loved playing with equipment they didn&#39;t have at home. But during one of the classes after several months, the instructor told on of them that they had to do something which the daughter had said she didn&#39;t want to do because it caused her wrist to hurt. I was not aware of this until after class because we are on the other side of the glass. Daughter did it, but hasn&#39;t been back since. If she had been truly interested in pursuing gymnastics, then she has said she knew she needed to do it, but since she just wanted to have fun and the class stopped being fun, she didn&#39;t want to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, they want to go to a summer camp that will give them horsemanship skills. I&#39;ve found one that I am working on, but the classes require a test at the end of the week in order to work their way through a nationally certified program. Neither daughter reads well, and they&#39;ve only had one very bad experience with taking tests. But they both want to do this horse camp. So they are determined to go and do the best that they can because it&#39;s something that they want. I can&#39;t change the camp program for them even though we will be paying a large sum for them to attend. They want to do it because it is their own goal, and they realize that to accomplish it, they will have to follow the rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because we are unschoolers, it doesn&#39;t mean that I can change a program to fit my kids, but I can give my kids options. They can choose to attend or not. They can go and not worry about actually passing the requirements but having fun instead (within any guidelines for the class). They can decide if it&#39;s a goal they want to reach, and they can decide what they are willing to do to reach it. I can&#39;t change the world&#39;s requirements for them, but I can support them and help them to reach any goals they want to reach. <br/>\n<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Classes, camps, programs, workshops, etc.","postDate":"1296139181","msgId":59267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2QjUwRTg4LUUwOUItNDRBRC1BRkNGLUJCMTFDOTk2ODVCQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlocnRudit1czlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlocnRudit1czlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59265,"nextInTopic":59271,"prevInTime":59266,"nextInTime":59268,"topicId":59258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I told her she could tell Joel that, or that I could tell Joel that.

So if we don&#39;t go, its no loss.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think, at this age of kids, 2 and 4.5, these kinds of classes have been helpful as I continue to move from attachment parenting to unschooling. While the parenting part has become more intuitive, the strewing part is taking longer to get. So, its nice to know that those hours are filled with something interesting that she loves to do, while I learn how to strew during the rest of our time. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can learn to strew while she&#39;s not there.  IF she&#39;s having fun, then great, but if you really want to move to unschooling, being with your daughter and helping that relationship blossom into something glorious is what it takes.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch&quot; model, it sounds like you&#39;re wanting to read a lot, while they&#39;re in classes.

At the community centre.  Originally, it was mommy and me classes... later when she became drop-off age, it was me taking her because it was an affordable way for me to have a break once a week.  I didn&#39;t force her, I wouldn&#39;t have done it if she didn&#39;t like it.  But she loves the teachers in those classes (this year its Creative Playtime, and Drama).  She fits well with the &#39;raise your hand&#39; and &#39;line up in a row&#39; atmosphere (as I did as a child), and seems to truly enjoy herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, I was discovering unschooling at the same time as transitioning to those drop-off classes.  I guess that was last year.  At first, I was concerned that by putting her in these classes I was doing something that wasn&#39;t unschooling.  That I wasn&#39;t right there with her if there was conflict.  That they have &#39;rules&#39;.  But there were discussions here where I remember reading that if your child likes to be somewhere, and that place has some rules, then thats fine.  Its okay to accept a set of rules, for the sake of enjoyment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe took a swim class this fall, and a ballet class.  The Ballet, she loved.  The swim, she really really wanted to go... but after the third class she didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  And I didn&#39;t make her.  And for the first three classes, when she expressed that Joel (the instructor) was trying to &#39;teach&#39; her how to swim, and all she really wanted to do was play with the water toys, I told her she could tell Joel that, or that I could tell Joel that.  I told her that I pay for the class, that I am Joel&#39;s boss, and that if she just wants to sit and play in the water, thats okay too.   But she didn&#39;t want me to interfere, and I guess she didn&#39;t want to say it to him, so she just didn&#39;t continue swimming.  He was a really sweet boy, though, and I think he would have been fine letting her play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that swim class, I saw many parents coercing, forcing, bribing, or forcing in some way their child to stay in the water, or listen to the teacher, etc.  It made me cringe.   It was really unhappy to be around the parents, and even one discussion I had which was about how important it was for kids to learn this skill and not to quit.  I thought, &quot;These aren&#39;t kids... these are just-barely-finished-toddlers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, Temima enjoys the schoolish aspects of these programs, and the fun she has.  I think it satisfies her curiosity about school a little bit.  She&#39;s never been to school, and so maybe thats why it works so well?  When we first started doing this, I tried to think of these classes as drop-ins, like some other programs we go to sometimes at the library.  I sign us up for those, but I don&#39;t commit to going every week, in my head.  Even though we are paying for each week, I look at it as paying for the option to go each week.  So if we don&#39;t go, its no loss.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, at this age of kids, 2 and 4.5, these kinds of classes have been helpful as I continue to move from attachment parenting to unschooling.  While the parenting part has become more intuitive, the strewing part is taking longer to get.  So, its nice to know that those hours are filled with something interesting that she loves to do, while I learn how to strew during the rest of our time. <br/>\n<br/>\nShira Rocklin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":458624268,"authorName":"dola dasgupta-banerji","from":"dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;doladg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Classes, camps, programs, workshops, etc.","postDate":"1296123141","msgId":59264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltXzBDR3RlRGo0PWhxRHZ4WVF6ZDJuME45ZmdfUVYrcy15XytwZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEVBRkUxREU4Qzk0MjQ0RTA4RjYzQzJCQ0Q1NkNCQzAxQFRhbWFyYT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlocW5uaCs1cGJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8QTNEM0ExREEtMTgxQy00QkVGLUJFRjktQzYwRTYzODdFQUZBQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8RUFGRTFERThDOTQyNDRFMDhGNjNDMkJDRDU2Q0JDMDFAVGFtYXJhPg=="},"prevInTopic":59263,"nextInTopic":59265,"prevInTime":59263,"nextInTime":59265,"topicId":59258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is a keen dancer.
