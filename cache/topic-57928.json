I went to the klutz website to look at it and found a page about their tricky videos book. There was a link from that page to videos they had made using the &quot;tricks&quot; in the book. my 2 children (age 7 and 4) spent about an hour watching them and lapping it up.<br/>\nThen we looked at some of the animations from the animation book.<br/>\nIt inspired lots of fun and pondering how they might have achieved the effects.<br/>\nWe will definitely be buying both books and downloading the software.<br/>\nFor anyone in the UK, amazon seems to have a great price on the books.<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Blandstein&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids have been interested in Stop Motion Movies for awhile and I have tried to help them but we havnt had alot of luck with the software we bought or downloaded and overall have all been disappointed because either the software wasnt really very good or the whole task was a little to cumbersome for the kids.
