I don&#39;t like the way many classes for homeschooler are done,<br/>\nespecially when they&#39;re done in a &quot;school-ish&quot;,or a developmentally<br/>\ninappropriate way.  I don&#39;t have a problem with classes in general,<br/>\nthough. Cacie and I met a woman at park day today who works as a clown,<br/>\nand Cacie was begging her to run some classes on it.  I suppose we could<br/>\njust ask her to teach some stuff to Cacie, and offer to pay her maybe,<br/>\nbut Cacie generally likes learning stuff with other people around, 1:1<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work as well, so that&#39;s basically a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while, there was a ranger working at one of the regional parks near<br/>\nus, and Cacie wanted to do all of her classes. Sometimes they would<br/>\nputter around in the cove and talk about stuff, sometimes they would do<br/>\ncrafts using natural materials, and sometimes they had hikes where they<br/>\ntalked about various ecological issues. The other rangers weren&#39;t as<br/>\ngood, though, and Megan was temporary, so once she left Cacie stopped<br/>\nsigning up for classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t like classes of any kind until she was 7 or so, then she<br/>\nsuddenyl became interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* like classes.  I really want to go back to college again once we<br/>\nmove, and take some classes. Some things are much easier for me to learn<br/>\nwhen someone else structures it. Other things aren&#39;t, of course....<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t necessarily think a bubbly, sparkly teacher is better. I kind of<br/>\nfind them annoying. I like smart teachers, who know and love their<br/>\nsubjects, and aren&#39;t defensive when questioned.<br/>\n<br/>\ndar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

I&#39;m in my late 40s, I&#39;m perimenopausal and I&#39;m tired of<br/>\ninefficiency and a lot of the crap that goes along with group dynamics.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be joined at the hip with another adult to go to a conference or<br/>\nto take my kids interesting places.  A lot of the mothers I know seem to <br/>\nneed that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":698072,"authorName":"Jorgen & Ann","from":"Jorgen & Ann &lt;stargate@...&gt;","profile":"ramoniac589","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Experience / local groups","postDate":"1012334868","msgId":3412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwwMzExMDcwMGI4N2NhOWViMjkwOUBbMjA2LjEzLjQ1LjEzMl0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODkwMWMxYThhNSRkYTFlYjQwMCRhNjcxZDFkMUBmZWxlc2luYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdmLjIwYjE4MTc2LjI5ODdiYTg1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3342,"nextInTopic":3431,"prevInTime":3411,"nextInTime":3413,"topicId":3340,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I take my cue from the kids. When the group activities are<br/>\n&quot;structured&quot; (which here translates into most parents chit-chatting about<br/>\ncurriculum etc. and a couple of parents trying to do specific fake-y<br/>\nactivities with kids), my kids don&#39;t have much interest. We sometimes have<br/>\nfound sub-groups like chess day that work out well--I just hang with the<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI  don&#39;t think it matters how big a group is because getting together for<br/>\nfun doesn&#39;t take a lot of people. We have been getting together with 2 or 3<br/>\nunschooling families regularly for a few months and we are now advertising<br/>\nthis on our local loop. It is really fun, the kids and the parents have a<br/>\nblast! This keeps my spirits up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also do the Scholastic thing for the big group. I promote using real<br/>\nbooks, and can use that to lead chit chat into unschooling. My kids are<br/>\nalso happy to talk to people about their interests and how they have<br/>\nlearned things on their own, which sometimes interests adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":53685616,"authorName":"Bronwen","from":"&quot;Bronwen&quot; &lt;felesina@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Experience / local groups","postDate":"1012295848","msgId":3342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODkwMWMxYThhNSRkYTFlYjQwMCRhNjcxZDFkMUBmZWxlc2luYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdmLjIwYjE4MTc2LjI5ODdiYTg1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3340,"nextInTopic":3412,"prevInTime":3341,"nextInTime":3343,"topicId":3340,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... talk ... right..

Because of the name and <br/>\nbecause I was the organizer, those who were structured just didn&#39;t talk about <br/>\nit there.  We just laughed and played--at parks, usually, or at my house <br/>\n(when we had the bigger house) or sometimes a public place (children&#39;s museum <br/>\nor some such).  That was more comfortable conversationally and socially, but <br/>\nlogistically it got old.  We grew a mound of lost&#39;n&#39;found stuff, the kids got <br/>\ntired of helping prepare, be hosts, and clean up.
