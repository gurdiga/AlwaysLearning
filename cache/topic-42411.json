It was part of a response to a mom who said  <br/>\npen pal letters were good handwriting practice for her son. And,  <br/>\nthough he could send a picture to the pen pal if he didn&#39;t want to  <br/>\nwrite, the fact was there that pen pal letters were a way to practice  <br/>\nhandwriting since it can&#39;t be a bad thing to have good handwriting.  <br/>\nSo while there&#39;s awareness that force isn&#39;t good, there&#39;s still the  <br/>\nhyperawareness of skills being learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe focus of unschooling should foremost be the relationship, between  <br/>\nchild and parent *and* between child and what they&#39;re doing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a useful-to-beginning-unschooling way to look at pen pal  <br/>\nletters (and other real life activities kids take on) is a multi-step  <br/>\nprocess:<br/>\n<br/>\n1, See *lots* of the skills an activity touches on. For the pan pal  <br/>\nactivity it&#39;s: geography, handwriting, writing, social connections,  <br/>\nsocial awareness, art, math, postal service and so on. If mom focuses  <br/>\non one of those skills and pressures the child to do the activity  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s good for handwriting or geography, she runs the risk of  <br/>\n1) creating unpleasant associations with the activity and skill so  <br/>\nthe child will want to avoid other opportunities that remind them of  <br/>\nthe unpleasantness, and 2) the child deciding the activity isn&#39;t fun  <br/>\nso dropping it and missing out on the other connections.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Seeing lots of *other* ways life draws on those skills. That way  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t feel like one activity is any more important than any  <br/>\nother activity. It helps us let go of the irrational fear that if he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t write pen pal letters, how will he ever learn to write!  <br/>\nDuring the time a child is writing pen pal letters, they&#39;re *not*  <br/>\nmaking labels or cartoons or playing with letter stamps. They&#39;re also  <br/>\n*not* doing something that may be more meaningful to them in their  <br/>\nright now life that involves art or math or physical skills or strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. And then, completely let go of the idea that activities lead to  <br/>\nskills :-) Focus on helping kids find activities that they enjoy.  <br/>\nFocus on letting go of the less fun parts and/or find ways to make  <br/>\nthem enjoyable. Be confident in the knowledge that basic skills are  <br/>\ndrawn on for loads of activities. (It&#39;s why they&#39;re basic!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Focus on your child. What does he love to do? Help him find more  <br/>\nof that and expand on it to the level that *he* wants :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Let yourself occasionally look at the skills and school subjects.  <br/>\n(This is most helpful after someone is fully confident that life  <br/>\nactivities draw on lots of skills.) I think it&#39;s easy for our own  <br/>\nbiases of favorite activities to skew what we choose to strew. I know  <br/>\nI strewed more books than out of the house activities. I got lucky  <br/>\nthat Kathryn was very similar to my personality but the more an  <br/>\nunschooling mom reaches beyond just her own likes for potential new  <br/>\ninterests the more helpful the strewing will be since our kids are  <br/>\nnot us :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel my problem is with my lack of education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think what&#39;s hampering you isn&#39;t lack of education but *believing*  <br/>\nthat lack of education is a problem. It&#39;s an important distinction!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling is not doing school, then more school wouldn&#39;t help!<br/>\n<br/>\n“Education is not filling a bucket, but lighting a fire.” -- William  <br/>\nButler Yeats<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing passionate, being curious, being observant, questioning and  <br/>\nthinking about everything is a lot more useful to unschooling than a  <br/>\nhead full of someone else&#39;s knowledge that&#39;s been poured in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When i read a excerpt from Jan Hunt in one of her unschooling  <br/>\n&gt; articles she mentions her 3 yo doing square roots and how she would  <br/>\n&gt; never had thought of teaching square roots at that age let alone  <br/>\n&gt; the method the child used.  I thought i dont even know what a  <br/>\n&gt; square root is any more and if my child did some how do this in  <br/>\n&gt; play i would not even notice probably.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And teaching her square roots wouldn&#39;t have guaranteed an  <br/>\nunderstanding. What was important to her in the moment was that she  <br/>\nsaw a pattern and played with it. Unless Jan Hunt&#39;s daughter is a  <br/>\nprodigy, she wasn&#39;t looking at a square root radical and magically  <br/>\nspouting off the answer. ;-) Maybe she put 9 blocks into a square and  <br/>\nnoticed both sides are 3. (And it&#39;s okay if most much older kids  <br/>\naren&#39;t doing that spontaneously, though having blocks and *playing*  <br/>\nwith them can be useful for kids who like them.) Noticing the  <br/>\nsquareness is more important than knowing how to do or what a square  <br/>\nroot is.

( i dont feel confident enouf to engage in conversations about unschooling yet) i get drilled about my reasons.  I am realizing it is not so much unlike unassisted birthing.  I had to avoid many a well meaning friends because of their concern for me.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI feel my problem is with my lack of education.  Not only do people raise their eye brows at me for home schooling, they seem shocked i barely made it out of high shcool.  When i first read about unschooling i thought yeah, i can finally feel confident that i can learn in a authentic way and do it at the same time with my children.  My excitement is getting a bit daunted by &quot;expert&quot; opinions now.<br/>\n <br/>\n I know unschoolers dont use curriculums, but my question is do those unschoolers that lack education them selves look at curriculums to make sure they give exposure to all the things that schooled kids get.  And if so where is a good sourse to find that information.  I have been on the web looking for curriculums and keep on becoming uninterested in them because of the sales pitches they come with.  I am looking for a nuts and bolts curriculim that i can lay infront of my kids and let them assemble it as well as bringing in other interests to put it all together.  When i read a excerpt from Jan Hunt in one of her unschooling articles she mentions her 3 yo doing square roots and how she would never had thought of teaching square roots at that age let alone the method the child used.  I thought i dont even know what a square root is any more and if my child did some how do this in play i would not even notice probably.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am sure my question is probably in the archives of this chat group, it seems like a common question and i have been trying to find that answer and i just keep on finding other interest to read about.  I am getting so hung up on it now that my son is 3 i want to hunker down and focus in on what kids are learning in elementary and high school these days and figure out how i can find real life experiences that would demonstrate them.  with knowing this i feel like i would better be able to talk to people about home schooling and unschooling and why our family is choosing it.  Right now i feel like my reasons for choosing unschooling are more intuitive than concrete knowledge.  Sorry this is so chatty but i hope some of you might be able to help me focus.<br/>\n <br/>\nStart where you are,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGertrude Caroline Arora, yoga mom <br/>\nBurlington,NJ <br/>\n609-386-0425<br/>\nfree classes available<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42254,"nextTopicId":42494}}
