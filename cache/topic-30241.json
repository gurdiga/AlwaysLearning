From my original post on AU: My daughter is very, very<br/>\nsorry about the situation and she cried, too, which made me even<br/>\nsadder. &lt;snip&gt; once I&#39;d collected myself I went and gave her a big hug<br/>\nand we talked about it.

I was at a women&#39;s retreat and I was<br/>\ngetting ready for the Friday night activities when I lost one of my<br/>\ncontacts. I have *really* poor vision without them and I my glasses<br/>\nwere being repaired at the time, so I didn&#39;t have them. I knew I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be able to see much the rest of the weekend and would<br/>\nprobably end up with a raging headache from squinting out of one eye.<br/>\nSeveral women jumped in to help me search for it but nothing turned<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d been holding the panic I felt at bay but eventually it seemed<br/>\nobvious that we weren&#39;t going to find it and I felt like crying. I was<br/>\nthinking about what a crappy time I&#39;d have and how much I had looked<br/>\nforward to the event -- pretty much feeling really sorry for myself.<br/>\nAfter a few more minutes I called off the search so my friends could<br/>\ngo enjoy their evening. I decided to come to terms with the missing<br/>\ncontact and I found myself thinking of ways that I could still have<br/>\nfun and find joy in the weekend despite this obstacle. As soon as I<br/>\naccepted the situation I felt a feeling of calmness wash over me and<br/>\nthen just a moment later my friend called out, &quot;Hey is this it?&quot; and<br/>\nsure enough it was, stuck to the side of the tissue boxes as plain as<br/>\nday even though we&#39;d all checked it several times.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Apple Juice in the Laptop","postDate":"1186705524","msgId":30243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5Z2I5aythcWFuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwODA5MTcwNG82Zjc5OTczY3E4OGYyZmIwZDZjM2I1NWEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30242,"nextInTopic":30244,"prevInTime":30242,"nextInTime":30244,"topicId":30241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We thought for *sure* it was death ...

My daughter was mucking about in the creek by our house the <br/>\nother day and dropped the MP3 player in it.  Not only did she feel bad <br/>\nabout it possibly not working again, she had to search in the foot deep <br/>\nmuddy water for it, while wading through it with her shoes, while the <br/>\ndog sat anxiously waiting for her on the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably would work still, but while I was taking it apart to dry it <br/>\nout and get the mud out, I accidentally ripped the power wire that was <br/>\nattatched to a flimsy piece of plastic paper stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both killed it!  Now we can&#39;t listen to cd&#39;s in the car, and she <br/>\ncan&#39;t take cd&#39;s and headphones with her when we go places.  I guess <br/>\nit&#39;s time for an ipod!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were sad about it for sure!  Some other kids we know would be <br/>\npunished for such a thing, but Chamille is way more important than an <br/>\nMP3 player!  The MP3 player was free, my dh won it from a business card <br/>\ndrawing at a local Subway shop.  We&#39;ve had it for over a year, so now <br/>\nwe&#39;ve opened the door for something better to come our way!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s weird and still totally understandable to be attatched to things <br/>\nthat we own, especially if we&#39;ve paid a lot of money for something and <br/>\nfeel we can&#39;t replace it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I thought I&#39;d lost my pocket knife that I&#39;ve had since I was <br/>\na kid.  I use it all the time, it&#39;s a really good knife and the company <br/>\nthat made it doesn&#39;t make them decent anymore.  It&#39;s almost a <br/>\ncollector&#39;s item, but I use it all the time anyway.  I started crying, <br/>\nthen shook myself out of it and ran to the park before it was too dark <br/>\nto see, to look around for it.  I spent a long time looking for it, but <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t until I said, &quot;I hope whoever finds it needs it more than I <br/>\ndo.&quot; that I found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thrilled that I needed it more than me... I was literally jumping <br/>\nup and down for pure joy of finding my pocket knife!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you still have your laptop!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Apple Juice in the Laptop","postDate":"1186704575","msgId":30242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwODA5MTcwOWgxYmE5MzkxN2gyMjY2ZjlhY2IxMjYyZWU2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwODA5MTcwNG82Zjc5OTczY3E4OGYyZmIwZDZjM2I1NWEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEE3NUUwMzAwLTdDRjgtNDdFRS1BNkM0LUVBNDJBRkM5NEI5REBzbGFja3dvcmtzLmNvbT4JIDw0N2NkOTBlMjA3MDgwOTE3MDRvNmY3OTk3M2NxODhmMmZiMGQ2YzNiNTVhM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30241,"nextInTopic":30243,"prevInTime":30241,"nextInTime":30243,"topicId":30241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oops!
