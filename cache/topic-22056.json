When <br/>\nI first really started researching alternitives to my son going to <br/>\nkindy I heard about the schools and I actually intended on opening <br/>\none of my own (I was still trying to make use of my college degrees, <br/>\nLOL) and probably would have except that I couldn&#39;t talk anyone else <br/>\ninto the idea of sending their kids to my house everyday rather than <br/>\nschool! Now that it has been just my ds & I home learning together <br/>\nmost of the time & having a lot of freedom, I&#39;m not sure if I would <br/>\nwant other kids around as much. Yes I would like for him to have <br/>\nmore friends & playtime with friends but he does have a playdate on <br/>\noccasion and frankly he seems pretty happy the way he is. He has <br/>\nactually said on more than one occasion that he enjoys playing <br/>\nalone, so I probably need to get over the socialization thing but I <br/>\nalso see that some things he learns better from others than from me, <br/>\nand I&#39;m still a little worried that he will miss out on something. <br/>\n(although I really don&#39;t like the way kids act most of the time in <br/>\nschool anyhow ie. teasing and such, I don&#39;t want him to learn <br/>\nthat!)  But for now he seems happy & learning more all the time so I <br/>\nwill just have to have hope that everything will be fine. But it&#39;s <br/>\nnot like I&#39;m closing doors to opportunities either as we are also <br/>\nsuppossed to have a playdate this week with another unschooling <br/>\nfamily that has a boy that&#39;s about 2 years older than my ds, so I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking forward to that as well. Hopefully it will be nice but I <br/>\nalso know that there are a LOT of variations in unschooling as well <br/>\nand just because we have some simalarities doesn&#39;t mean we will get <br/>\nalong well. Anyhow, I&#39;m getting long now, I just wanted to share my <br/>\nexperience that not everyone comes by unschooling or life learning <br/>\nthrough attachment parenting, some of us go a longer way around. <br/>\nMoza</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":37498976,"authorName":"Cindy Fox","from":"&quot;Cindy Fox&quot; &lt;cindyfox@...&gt;","profile":"cindycindyfox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] interesting development ....","postDate":"1114453345","msgId":22079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDI1MTgyMjQzLlNNTksyMjQzMC5mZWQxcm1tdGFvMDIuY294Lm5ldEBidXR0ZXJmbHk+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwZTE1MGJmNzU0OWYzZGIxMjZlZGUyZDZlYTFmYTdmQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":22077,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":22078,"nextInTime":22080,"topicId":22056,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That was much like the teacher Richie had in Montessori.

They are closing in June, and I understand that they changed their open concept to more structured learning due to pressure from parents. The only parents who could afford the tuition typically were &quot;highly educated&quot; profs from the local university and other professionals in the area who wanted the small private school setting but also wanted state standards met and formulaic curriculum. Being that it was a small town, there were no other choices. So they systematically forced the change at the only private school they had, through the parent-run board. Now it&#39;s closing. I&#39;m sure it lost its life and passion as soon as the kids lost the control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, open classroom settings, or open school settings like Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts can offer an unschooling setting within a community, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 24, 2005 10:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] interesting development ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 4/24/2005 11:12:26 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacki@...\">jacki@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, there&#39;s no one set of things taught  throughout<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;public schools.&quot; It varies  hugely.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>========<br/>\n <br/>\nSome states and districts are trying very hard to do away with that  little <br/>\nglitch in the system. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Too bad it doesn&#39;t vary depending on the students in the classroom and  <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nTHEY&#39;D like to learn/do.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWell some people tried that in the 70&#39;s. &lt;g&gt;  It was called  &quot;the open <br/>\nclassroom&quot; and it didn&#39;t work for them, but it can work for  us!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a recent article about it (a quote and a link follow):<br/>\n-=-  <br/>\nIn both Britain and the United States, open classrooms contained no  <br/>\nwhole-class lessons, no standardized tests, and no detailed curriculum.

As a fifth grader I did a year-long project about death, for example... I wrote a novel about how a family deals with a death, I read Elisabeth Kubler-Ross&#39; books about death and dying, and other books about death in other cultures. It was fascinating. The best part was that I never finished the novel or came up with any sort of final &quot;showcase&quot; for what I&#39;d learned, and it was okay. The next year I did a fairly long study of ESP...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message in gifted ed, during the seventies, anyway, was that because we were so brilliant, we would be interested in things besides schoolwork, and so they were giving us an opportunity to follow those pasions. The false assumption, of course, was that &quot;regular&quot; children didn&#39;t have thse kinds of interests and passions...<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, when I taught kids with ED/BD labels, I also got to &quot;teach&quot; pretty much what the kids were interested in. With my kids, the school mostly cared that they were engaged in doing *something* other than punching people, so we had the freedom to do a whole unit on boogers and butts, including pattern block patterns of anuses in action. I am not actually sure that the powers that be knew what we were doing all of the time, however...<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that the there tends to be a lot more freedom and leniency on the &quot;fringes&quot;, rather than in the mainstream. I see the same thought process in people who think unschooling is fine for children who are &quot;different&quot;, but not for &quot;regular&quot; kids. There&#39;s an assumption that if the system appears to be &quot;working&quot; for kids - they&#39;re not getting into trouble, their grades are good but not exceptional - then it&#39;s wrong to do anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n-- &quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacki@...\">jacki@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, there&#39;s no one set of things taught throughout<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;public schools.&quot; It varies hugely.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Too bad it doesn&#39;t vary depending on the students in the classroom and what<br/>\nTHEY&#39;D like to learn/do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!

Having been schooled myself, I am having so much fun <br/>\nunschooling my child as best I can since I get to share my interests <br/>\nand share his and I am learning things I don&#39;t know every day as well!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow fun!  :)  Sometimes I think I get the better end of the deal! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, c.<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you haven&#39;t yet browsed Sandra&#39;s website - oh WHAT a treat you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in store for yourself!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Apr 21, 2005, at 8:40 AM, Sunday Cote wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the list, and I&#39;d love to read your article, &quot;I Live<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Therefore I Learn.&quot;  Is there a link to that or can you send it to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>me?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] interesting development ....","postDate":"1114104126","msgId":22062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmNC44M2Q3MGM1LjJmOTkzYjNlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22061,"nextInTopic":22063,"prevInTime":22061,"nextInTime":22063,"topicId":22056,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/2005 10:57:42 AM Mountain Daylight Time, sundaycote@cox.net writes: I m new to the list, and I d love to read your article, I  Live ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-630215386\">In a message dated 4/21/2005 10:57:42 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sundaycote@...\">sundaycote@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to the list, and I&#39;d love to read your article, &quot;I  Live<br/>\nTherefore I Learn.&quot;  Is there a link to that or can you send it  to me?<br/>\n <br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive_\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive)\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] interesting development ....","postDate":"1114102669","msgId":22061,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRhZTYwM2ZmMjE5ZjI4NzJkZDRhOTVhNzk1MzlhMzUzQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1NDY4OCQ3NGNmZjcxMCQwNjJiYjA0NkBEMTZWNDk0MT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1NDY4OCQ3NGNmZjcxMCQwNjJiYjA0NkBEMTZWNDk0MT4="},"prevInTopic":22059,"nextInTopic":22062,"prevInTime":22060,"nextInTime":22062,"topicId":22056,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" If you haven t yet browsed Sandra s website - oh WHAT a treat you have in store for yourself!!! -pam","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-123902662\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/ilive</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t yet browsed Sandra&#39;s website - oh WHAT a treat you have <br/>\nin store for yourself!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 21, 2005, at 8:40 AM, Sunday Cote wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to the list, and I&#39;d love to read your article, &quot;I Live<br/>\n&gt; Therefore I Learn.&quot;  Is there a link to that or can you send it to me? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":167822625,"authorName":"Sunday Cote","from":"&quot;Sunday Cote&quot; &lt;sundaycote@...&gt;","profile":"revsunday2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] interesting development ....","postDate":"1114098028","msgId":22059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1NDY4OCQ3NGNmZjcxMCQwNjJiYjA0NkBEMTZWNDk0MT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQzZjBlYTcyYjQ2ZDhmMGQxZmE1NzhlMTZjNjMyYjIxQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":22056,"nextInTopic":22061,"prevInTime":22058,"nextInTime":22060,"topicId":22056,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Enjoyed your post, Pam.
