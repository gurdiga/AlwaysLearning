I<br/>\nspent a summer (8) with his family.  I saw him bounce<br/>\nmy  cousin, Sonny&#39;s head off the wall becuase he was a<br/>\nfew minutes late to  Sunday dinner. He was<br/>\nunreasonable in other ways, too. Patricia, and Joey,<br/>\nthe next youngest after Sonny, killed themselves. The<br/>\nstep-father civil engineer held me by one foot in the<br/>\nair while he &quot;spanked&quot; me....in front of a room of<br/>\nother children as I had continued to sing softly when<br/>\nwe were all told to be quiet. I was too embarrassed to<br/>\ncry. My clothing fell over my head exposing my<br/>\npanties. He was much worse to my brothers. Of course,<br/>\nthat was not an isolated incident. BUT he taught me to<br/>\nuse a slide rule when I was 4....because I wanted to<br/>\nknow how it worked. The grandfather( he was already in<br/>\nhis 60s when mother was born) beat my (Canasta<br/>\nplaying) grandmother and molested my mother (she used<br/>\nhim as a model for adult behaviour) who became the<br/>\nsuicidal alcoholic, who set me up for similar<br/>\nexperiences, except she did a good portion of the<br/>\nbeating herself. Except for a few visits with (those<br/>\ndamned Clavinists, as my mother called them) my father<br/>\nand his parents before age 6, and court paternity<br/>\nhearings about one of my little brothers, I didn&#39;t see<br/>\nthe father, electrical engineer, until I was 17.  When<br/>\nI was 18 he came to my apartment and my roommate<br/>\nalmost called the police (we didn&#39;t have a phone) as<br/>\nhe claimed to be my father.  The common denomitaor<br/>\nis/was my mother. They all had rotten interpersonal<br/>\nskills.  That is one reason that they were attracted<br/>\nto the discernable order of engineering. And not one<br/>\nof them ever discouraged anybody from the field....any<br/>\ninterest evidenced was considered flattery. The only<br/>\nreally nice one, is G&#39;Ma Louise. She redeemed my<br/>\nfather. I met her when I met him. But she once<br/>\n(?)slugged (knocked him down with a fist directed to<br/>\nhis face) my half-brother (I met him when I was in my<br/>\ntwenties) and he committed an armed robbery when he<br/>\nwas in high-school. He committed some other vandalisms<br/>\non the school, too. He is now a historian who does<br/>\nroofing for money. G&#39;Ma blames it on the &quot;wrong&quot;<br/>\ncrowd. Dunno. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I took custody of my sister, denying it to her<br/>\nfather (the civil engineer step-father) I found that<br/>\nit was necessary to create a civil :) working<br/>\nrelationship with her Daddy, for her.  She loves him. <br/>\nIt has all worked out, relatively :) speaking since. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my littlest brother got back from Vietnam he was<br/>\na wreck, but needed somewhere to live.  Our father,<br/>\nG&#39;Pa Bill, the electrical engineer, and G&#39;Ma Louise<br/>\nhad just showed me their slides from Tibet and Nepal<br/>\nso I approached them from the standpoint of Karma. <br/>\nThey didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, but they<br/>\nhad 4 or so empty bedrooms and lots of other space :)<br/>\nso they invited him (thank you thank you)to<br/>\nHuntsville, and he&#39;s been there since. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was previously talking about the good part of them.<br/>\nThey are human beings.  There is much more good and<br/>\nmuch more bad than I can possibly recount.<br/>\n.............<br/>\nSandra, it sounds like YOU generate the good energy <br/>\neverywhere! Even a hat cake!

It was a mystery<br/>\n&quot;who-done-it&quot; party. Kind of like sort of grown-ups<br/>\nplaying detectives.  The interesting part was that<br/>\nthey actually took the time out of their lives to do<br/>\nit...just for fun, for themselves.  It wasn&#39;t FOR<br/>\nanything.  Not a benefit, or holiday, or child&#39;s<br/>\nbirthday.  The hostess and the guests were European,<br/>\nexcept for me. Are Americans fuddy-duddies compared to<br/>\nothers?
