In other words, particularly for the &quot;older generations&quot;, ideas about what it means to go to school are often out of date.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 60 and went to school in the 1950s and 60s, and I&#39;m pretty sure from conversations I&#39;ve had that some of my contemporaries believe that nothing has changed since then and for others it&#39;s only slowly dawning on them that life isn&#39;t like that any more. Going to school remains a sacred cow and there are some people who will tie their thinking into knots rather than face facts. Maybe that will be the case for a while yet since so many people have emotional - and financial - investments to protect. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made a crucial difference with me was that my two children were born ten years apart (1985 and 1995). There was a gap of actually almost eleven years between my daughter starting school in England in 1990 and my son starting school here in Australia in 2001. Given the dramatic changes that had begun to occur in our society between those two events, the contrast of my son&#39;s school experience against that of his ten years older sister was unavoidably apparent. Without a doubt, the &#39;killer&#39; difference was that, by the time my son started school, we had the internet in our home. We were all using it without restriction and when my son became chronically unhappy at school in his second year, I could see that one of the problems was that he was not only learning so very little in the school classroom compared to what he was learning at home, he was getting upset with being constantly told what to be interested in and what to not be interested in. He wasn&#39;t used to that and he objected to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he was removed from school when he was seven years old and now I have a well educated 16 year old son who is currently a student at a local Institute of Technology and doing just fine and in between we shared a perception changing adventure of, mainly, what I like to call free form 24/7 learning at the speed of thought through ubiquitous electronic media according to interest and/or need, but &quot;unschooling&quot; is less of a mouthful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve evolved a number of strategies over the years that I use in conversations on the subject of school vs. no school. Too complex to explain here, but one I use a lot is that it&#39;s 2012 now. Thanks to the &quot;digital communications revolution&quot;, we can learn whatever *we* decide is important, valuable and useful to us, wherever we are, at whatever times suit us, in whichever ways we prefer.

What *don&#39;t* schools teach that every adult needs? &quot;Don&#39;t get me started&quot; as the saying goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a matter of finding your own inner conviction that what you&#39;re doing is right whatever anybody else believes. That can probably only emerge over time with the feedback of the actual adventure, perhaps pondering on your own school experiences and how they compare to how you like to learn as an adult (I found that very useful myself). Being aware of how &quot;learning technology&quot; is impacting everybody&#39;s daily lives in ways that schools simply cannot compete with. My own &#39;big thing&#39; again. Judy Breck of www.handschooling.com is good to read in that respect (it&#39;s a shame she ties her ideas to school reform, which I wouldn&#39;t do, but they&#39;re still ideas worth exploring).<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Me vs. The Inlaws (hubby included)","postDate":"1332878641","msgId":66464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxNTk5QzIzLUVCN0QtNDU4OC05QjJCLUQzRURDMjJENDkzQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprc3NzaCtuY2pxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGprc3NzaCtuY2pxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66462,"nextInTopic":66479,"prevInTime":66463,"nextInTime":66465,"topicId":66452,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/dads A collection of things by or for dads","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1514238751\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/dads\">http://sandradodd.com/dads</a><br/>\nA collection of things by or for dads</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"Bun","from":"&quot;Bun&quot; &lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Me vs. The Inlaws (hubby included)","postDate":"1332868817","msgId":66462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprc3NzaCtuY2pxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzI4Mjc4MzguODk4Mi5ZYWhvb01haWxDbGFzc2ljQHdlYjE2MjEwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66460,"nextInTopic":66464,"prevInTime":66461,"nextInTime":66463,"topicId":66452,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe eventually showing your husband some books and blogs by father s might help?

And even when they could agree that my son was miserable in school and that _something_ needed to be done, they didn&#39;t understand why I pulled my daughter out of school, too. One thing thing that I say that usually helps is something along the lines of:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think of homeschooling -v- traditional school the same way I think of living in the city -v- living in the country: There are pros and cons to each situation and not every setting is right for every kid.

I worried that, as the middle child who never feels like she gets enough attention, she would feel like we were &quot;sending her away&quot; if we kept her brother home and sent her to school. And I felt that logistically it would be much harder to homeschool our oldest if we were also beholden to the school schedule. I wanted to keep her home, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped was talking with him and finding out what his goals were for her and saying that after we figured out what the goals were, we could 1) work on meeting them *right away* rather than looking 6-months ahead to the start of her kindergarten year, and 2) that it would help us objectively determine if one setting would be better for her than the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he made a list of goals her, he realized that the ONLY one he had for her that couldn&#39;t be met either place was &quot;finding out for herself whether or not she likes school,&quot; it made it a lot easier for him to relax and let it be her choice, not ours. And talking about the registration process being for the schools benefit (planning, etc.) not ours, helped too.

That&#39;s not true of unschooling.  A few kids at school succeed--they win the contest.   If every kid at the best school in the world worked really hard, how many valedictorians would there be?  How many would get the top scores?  How many on the honor roll or dean&#39;s list?   ONE valedictorian, five or ten percent get A&#39;s--maybe 15%.  Any more than that, and the A&#39;s are worthless. So 75 or 80% of the kids get B or lower, not because they&#39;re not learning, but because they didn&#39;t win the contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can know this without mentioning it to your husband or in-laws.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best things to say when someone is afraid about unschooling or critical is &quot;It&#39;s working for now.  If it stops working, we can put her back in school.&quot;   It gives them hope that they might &quot;get their way.&quot;  Don&#39;t mention that what they&#39;re hoping for is unhappiness and failure.  It might be true but they don&#39;t know it; it&#39;s not conscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting along with your husband is more important than unschooling.  You can probably do both, but don&#39;t make an ultimatum out of it.  You&#39;re three months in.

And I have loved every moment of it and am 110% committed to it--the relationships with my kids (and husband) have become so much deeper, I love watching my kids thrive in their environment and love learning right alongside them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was not on-board with unschooling at first and finally reached a point where he said, &quot;I don&#39;t care.  Do what you want.&quot;  He was obviously frustrated and I have tried to help him understand about unschooling, but he just doesn&#39;t get it.  I have a blog full of photos and at least twice a week I will write out a very detailed summary of what we do and talk about that day so he can see the progress we make.  And this seemed to satiate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Free To Learn book came out, I read it and recommended it to him.  He started reading it and said he was starting to understand where I was coming from.  A week ago, I was out of town for 4 days and he seemed to be having a great time with the kids, asked for me to send him the book and said literally, &quot;I want to know more--I want to be part of the team.&quot;  Happy dance!<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring that time, his mom came up (a HUGE supporter of education, particularly formal education).  I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I came home and some of the comments that were made made me feel a bit awkward.  Keep in mind that I am closer to this woman than my own mother--I very much enjoy her friendship and insight.  We aren&#39;t super close, but we talk often and she tends to have good words of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after returning from my trip, the kids and I went to stay with our in-laws for a few weeks (which is where we are currently).  We&#39;ve been here for 3 days and it&#39;s been so stressful for me.  I have tried explaining why I so love unschooling and how it works, but my MIL has just as many reasons why she loves public education.  I have a very difficult time with confrontation and formulating words that sound like anything intelligent...quite frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today when she equated me allowing my 6 year old daughter to play on a play structure at the park with a lollipop in her mouth, she equated it to me letting her drive drunk (!?!??!), &quot;When will you, having much more knowledge than she, put your foot down and just say &quot;NO.&quot;??&quot;  I was so taken aback by the confrontation that I just said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; and she walked away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I emailed my husband, asking for advice on what I should do or say because the tension is horrible here, and we still have another 2 1/2 weeks here, and I get an email telling me that he is &quot;finally voicing his opinion.&quot;  About how he felt good because our daughter was going to school like we did and our parents did, and look how good we all turned out.  She liked it there, I got &quot;me time&quot;...now it&#39;s like we&#39;re saying &#39;eh, they&#39;ll turn out better THIS way&#39; when in reality we don&#39;t know whether it&#39;ll make them better or worse, &quot;but my gut says worse.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even know what to feel...to be honest, I knew he wasn&#39;t hugely on-board at first, but he lead me to believe that he was good with the blogs, etc. and that he was so proud of our 6 year old reading at a third grade reading level...  I feel almost betrayed because I had thought that he understood and he wanted to be more involved, and saw that progress can be made in this environment, and now this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is not one ounce of me that plans on putting my kids back into public education (my daughter thanks me nearly every day for letting her homeschool, and I absolutely love having her with me!).  But I am at a loss as to what to do.  It&#39;s obvious that my MIL has been talking to my husband and I just...I don&#39;t know what to do.  Any insight would be extremely helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66470,"nextTopicId":66490}}
