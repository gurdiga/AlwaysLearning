I hope it&#39;s okay to come in on this thread, though...<br/>\n<br/>\nRe depression,<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking about brain chemical imbalances - here&#39;s a way to help that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrequire much effort so long as it&#39;s accepted.<br/>\nPly her with fresh, preferably organic if you can afford them, vegies and<br/>\nfruit, especially vegies. Raw is preferable, steamed or stir fried next.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that when I&#39;m depressed (environment/illness induced rather than<br/>\npsychological) if someone plies me with fresh vegie juice, salads and yummy<br/>\nhealthy snacks (no highly processed or starchy foods) then my depression<br/>\nstarts to diminish and I can tackle the positive thinking side of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of magnesim and zinc foods or supplements, B vitamins, Omega 3. St<br/>\nJohn&#39;s Wort is a good supplement if she can take it, but be careful as you<br/>\ncan&#39;t take this with other medication.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was depressed for over 20 years - during the years my children were<br/>\nunschooling. It wasn&#39;t recognised at all by anyone and my immediate family<br/>\nhad no idea how to help. My kids were brillliant - they were able to offer<br/>\nunconditional love in my darkest moments and just held me. That kept me<br/>\nalive. Just being held. Sometimes I&#39;d push my dh away, but never the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nTackle the physical brain chemistry thing and then gently encourage your mom<br/>\nto reprogram her thinking with positive thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody gets anything out of being depressed, even though it may look like<br/>\nit. Depression is a trap, not a lurk. Group therapy helped me - leaving our<br/>\n&#39;expectations&#39; of each other at the door was another way of bringing<br/>\nunconditional love into my life. I needed that, after having had illnesses<br/>\nignored all the way through childhood.  I also read lots of self-help<br/>\nbooks - they all helped, but that was because I desperately wanted to be<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Sandra hit the nail on the head when she mentioned choice and<br/>\nresponsibility in the same sentence. Perhaps your mom is probably<br/>\noverwhelmed by her sense of responsibility - she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nresponsible for herself any more - choice depresses her, she wants to be<br/>\nmothered, to be dependent, have the day to day responsibility of making<br/>\ndecisions lifted from her shoulders so she can heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to bolster healing is to get creative. It&#39;s impossible to be<br/>\ndepressed when you are being creative. Make time to be creative together, or<br/>\nwith the kids. Get her to do something creative (simple, like blowing<br/>\nbubbles or finger painting) with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to blow the blues away is to get down by some water and wander.<br/>\nThe beach is the absolute best, but a pond or river will suffice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith your mom&#39;s negativity I&#39;d be polite, then blunt, if politeness doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork. Especially with respect to your daughter. I&#39;m an overprotective mum<br/>\naround my kids and proud of it. I&#39;d say &quot;do you mind not talking meanly to<br/>\nher&quot;. It took years for this to be effective though - for some reason<br/>\ngrandparents seem to think they can treat our kids like they were their<br/>\nkids...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I keep trying to brainstorm with them<br/>\n&gt; in an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; them over to choice and freedom? Or do I<br/>\n&gt; make the choice to give up these relationships?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who are you trying to convince of your belief - them or yourself? If they<br/>\ntruly don&#39;t believe you or don&#39;t want to listen, leave them alone. Talk<br/>\nabout something else. If their actions impact on you tell them how you feel<br/>\nabout each action, but stop trying to sell them on your philosophy. A simple<br/>\n&quot;when you do that to me I feel hurt and rejected... or whatever&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers<br/>\nBeverley<br/>\nwww.beverleypaine.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19929,"nextTopicId":19937}}
