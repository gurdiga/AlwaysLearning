Before that we were<br/>\npart of a Summerhill type private school. He is a filmmaker and creative<br/>\nwriter. He hates to follow someone else&#39;s idea of a schedule, and really has<br/>\nhis own rhythm in life (I guess we all do...his seems more unique to me).<br/>\nWith the freedom of unschooling, we were able to hook up with a local movie<br/>\nproducer here in the Phoenix area, who is now producing Andrew&#39;s first film,<br/>\na dark comedy/horror. This producer has let the whole creation and<br/>\nproduction of Andrew&#39;s movie come from him, and has been an unbelievable<br/>\nsupport and resource. Tonight there are local actors coming over to do a<br/>\nread-through of the script. Andrew went to Sundance Film Festival a few<br/>\nweeks ago with the film producer and made some connections. When Andrew is<br/>\nworking on the film, he has light in his eyes, makes eye contact, and is<br/>\njust so alive. You&#39;d not know he has had such major communication and social<br/>\nissues in his life. This is so different from when he was in school<br/>\nfollowing a &quot;school&quot; schedule. He was (and sometimes still is) just like the<br/>\nboy you described Sandra, flat affect, bored-looking, no eye contact. If he<br/>\nwas in school full time, I don&#39;t know what he would be doing or enjoying at<br/>\nthis point, since he wouldn&#39;t have had the time to pursue his passion. I am<br/>\nso glad we are free. I hope that boy gets more joy too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 25, 2005 10:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] writing and communication<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is commentary on a small slice of life of a friend&#39;s son who is very<br/>\nschooled.
