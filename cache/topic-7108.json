Some people<br/>\nlike a lot more TV than others. I personally don&#39;t like to have it on unless<br/>\nI&#39;m watching a specific program (and even then I read a book during the<br/>\ncommercials &lt;g&gt;) but my husband likes to have it on quite a lot. When bored,<br/>\nhe&#39;s likely to turn it on and pick some REALLY stupid movie (he likes to<br/>\nmake snide remarks at really stupid movies) halfway in and happily watch<br/>\nthat (and half a dozen other programs at the same time). When I&#39;m bored I&#39;m<br/>\nlikely to read or bake or clean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the only thing I would be asking myself is: is he going to the TV because<br/>\nthat&#39;s the only interesting thing to do? If yes, time to spend more time out<br/>\nof the house, or in the house building rocket ships or those cool<br/>\nscience-project valcanos or playing Dinosaurs or whatever his other<br/>\ninterests are. If you&#39;re already offering all that, and he still chooses TV,<br/>\nthen it&#39;s his real choice (and I cannot even BEGIN to list all the things my<br/>\ndaughters have learned from television. &quot;Good&quot; stuff, too, not just the<br/>\nnames of Pokemon).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nI am wondering...Can all kids self-regulate TV?

Some people like to watch a lot, some a little, some none.<br/>\nBasically the same with any normal activity.
