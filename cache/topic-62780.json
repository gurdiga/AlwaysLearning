About 10 years ago I began to get extremely stressed out with action movies.  Now I&#39;ve noticed that I get extremely sad - not so much stressed out but sad to the point of tears running down my cheeks with war movies.  The human suffering gets to me and I don&#39;t know why - I feel it so deeply the soldier&#39;s suffering and their families back home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching on a small TV screen does not help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can watch documentaries with no problem - which show real footage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I should also say the movies that bother me so much are from a time period of around the American Revolution to current.  Meaning if I watch a movie about the Romans it does not make me sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically Zac has been watching WWI movies the past 2 weeks and it just breaks my heart and I stay sad for several hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sadness actually caught me off guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions on how to enjoy these movies with Zac ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62781,"nextTopicId":62791}}
