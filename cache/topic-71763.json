A lot.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 year old is beginning to play with the idea of choices and control in a funny way. He&#39;ll say something to me like &quot;I&#39;m not asking for another bowl of ice cream, but if I were, you&#39;d probably say no, right?&quot; He&#39;s so sincere about it, and every time I want to smile! Sometimes, the answer is, &quot;Sure, have another bowl,&quot; And other times, it&#39;s &quot;I wanted to save the last bowl for dad when he gets home. I&#39;ll pick up another half-gallon tomorrow,&quot; or &quot;Maybe ask your brother first he wants to split the last of it with you.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if we had a relationship characterized by control, he&#39;d be one of those kids who told himself no a lot--he&#39;s really concerned with doing the right thing. But he&#39;s learning how to identify his choices AND get the information he needs to make a choice that he feels good about, not guilty or deprived or martyr-ish. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nWoody (7) and Fox (4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wrote this in response to something on someone&#39;s facebook page, but it seemed worth sharing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t the quote yet.
