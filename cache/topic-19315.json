Because I was already friends with all of the moms and because there are few of us and we aren&#39;t focusing on one age, we&#39;ve always been able to keep it loose.   (We can&#39;t really make it look like school with the range of kids we have.)   Originally our biweekly get togethers had a story or two read aloud and then an art, craft or science project that everybody could do their own way.  I would let my kid wander off if he wasn&#39;t interested.  (He&#39;d usually start the craft but be &quot;done&quot; in less than 10 minutes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGradually the group got looser and squisher.  (Probably my disruptive influence. &lt;g&gt;)  Now we mainly go on nature hikes, but sometimes band together to go on field trips.  Nature hikes are great because we can walk, socialize, relax, feel inspired and learn something about nature all in the same afternoon.  That kind of efficiency appeals to even the most achievement oriented moms. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of prefer a small group over a big one, because I don&#39;t like the feeling of being badly outnumbered.  Creating a relaxed group may not work with people who are skeptical about unschooling.  People in my group had known my kid for a long time and knew that my strange &quot;methods&quot; were NOT making him stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157863786,"authorName":"Kay Alina","from":"&quot;Kay Alina&quot; &lt;angelsguard@...&gt;","profile":"angelsguardalways","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] co-ops","postDate":"1082423898","msgId":19316,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWM0MjY3NSQ1ZDEzNmRjMCQxYTkxZmVhOUBkZWZhdWx0Mjc1NThtMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0MjY2YiRlOGIzY2MzMCQ2NDAwYThjMEB5b3Vyam9ua3c2OHRseT4="},"prevInTopic":19315,"nextInTopic":19319,"prevInTime":19315,"nextInTime":19317,"topicId":19315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Susan, I think your awareness to your sensitivity to language and usage is an important key.

I have never thought twice about referring to Alexander&#39;s enrichment activities as class.  He is still young but we do live in America and the term like it or not does denote something and always will.  His enrichment classes are night and day from his preschool.  He was looking forward to school and going to class until it happened.  Well, as I have said before live and learn.  Alex has many classes and all of them denote a fun enjoyable experience.  There is a structure, a beginning and an end but he is joyful when they are through.  Perhaps if you can bring your own unique talent and joy to the environment the term &quot;class&quot; will begin to mean something different.  I too, have found myself in a defensive position with friends at times.  I hang on to the knowing the proof shall be in the pudding.  I am guilty of using the term homeschooling when we are far more unschooling but I am not ready to educate every person who crosses my path.  Those are just some thoughts that came up.  I wish there was a co-op we could go to close but the only one I am aware of is a 45 minute drive and not worth it.  <br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nKay<br/>\nK<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Susan Fuerst","from":"&quot;Susan Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","profile":"jsf491","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] co-ops","postDate":"1082419836","msgId":19315,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0MjY2YiRlOGIzY2MzMCQ2NDAwYThjMEB5b3Vyam9ua3c2OHRseT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwODIzODI2NDkuMzkwLjQ1MTIzLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19316,"prevInTime":19314,"nextInTime":19316,"topicId":19315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Susan What you do speaks so loudly, it doesn t let me hear what you say Ralph Waldo Emerson Hey everyone, I am wondering if anyone has been able to be part","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2125820005\">Susan<br/>\n&quot;What you do speaks so loudly, it doesn&#39;t let me hear what you say&quot;<br/>\nRalph Waldo Emerson<br/>\n<br/>\nHey everyone,<br/>\nI am wondering if anyone has been able to be part of a co-op and<br/>\nunschool well?  <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, there is a &#39;gym&#39; group we have attended for several years,<br/>\nwhich I find &#39;too schooly&#39;, though the kids want to go mainly to connect<br/>\nwith other families.
