if this it is only about black people or not because we haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen around anyone who is say, for instance, Indian or Native American.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux has gone through a similar thing.  We have an extended family network that runs the gamit.  Our closest, in proximity to our house, like 10 mi away, family are a bi-racial family.  I&#39;d say that Margaux&#39;s first experience with someone who has very dark skin is the dad in that family.  Both of my girls have gone through periods of being terrified of him.  Chamille&#39;s experience came after already living in a very multi ethnic neighborhood with a best friend who&#39;d dad is black and mom is white, so her experience was different than Margaux&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe man is very tall, and he&#39;s not a big friendly giant.  He tells amusing stories if you can take the time to understand his accent, which I imagine Margaux didn&#39;t, but more than that, his own children are terrified of him, he&#39;s not a soft spoken gentle father.  To add to that, the girl in that family is a couple of years older than Margaux, and she is NOT nice at all and the little boy who is one year older than Margaux, spent many years being destructive towards everyone and their things.  So, combine that with the worst neighbor kids in our neighborhood right now and Margaux&#39;s view of people with dark skin has been tainted in an unfavorable light.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisney shows have been very helpful in providing a much more balanced look at many different people with many different backgrounds.  We also have a photography book called 1000 families that&#39;s not really a picture book but more of a documentary for the coming of the year 2000.  It has pictures of families from all over the world, in their environments with captions of what they hope for in the coming millenium.  She has spent many hours looking at those pictures of families.  She has seemed most interested in the nomadic families with camels and how they avoid land mines, or not, and how people without legs or limbs survive in those environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s coming to a better understanding of people in general, she&#39;s 8, but it&#39;s taken time.  She still won&#39;t mix her barbies, although she has said that the black barbies are more valuable and I have no idea why she believes this, espeically since she rarely plays with them because they don&#39;t have kids and husbands to match them with.  As an interesting side not, when we lived in a different part of town, the toys stores had predominately black barbies and were almost always out of the white ones because they never stocked that many to begin with.  She has seen that most stores around where we live now are almost always out of the black barbies because they don&#39;t stock as many.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly wouldn&#39;t push it.  It&#39;s common in some areas to be the only black person or the only white person.  That&#39;s about demographics and that IS something we talk about.  Especially in light of how stores stock barbies and baby dolls of color. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of
