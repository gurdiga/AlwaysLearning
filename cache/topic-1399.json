I have it all <br/>\nsomewhere, but not all in one place.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI saved the big envelope, but gave the stamps to a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe orginal letter is in some safe place (darn me, when we moved...) but I <br/>\ndefinitely have it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a copy on the wall here in my office.  <br/>\n<br/>\nit starts off &quot;Dear Sandra, <br/>\nWhen I called in this, my manager&#39;s office, a few moments ago I was handed my <br/>\nvery first American fan letter - and it was from you.  I was so pleased that <br/>\nI had to sit down and type an immediate reply...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was 1967.  My friends would come over and say &quot;Yeah, but who IS he?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy uncle was the manager of a C&W station in Amarillo, and they would get <br/>\npromotional albums.  I had a cousin my age, had an old light-up juke box in <br/>\nher bedroom, had music of all sorts, and he would let her go through the <br/>\nnon-C&W stuff and keep what she wanted.   She didn&#39;t keep this one (the promo <br/>\nof his first album) and it came to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was weird, and interesting, and I wrote him a letter.  I had told him I <br/>\nliked his writing, and the songs were good.  I think I&#39;d told him they were <br/>\nas good as the Beatles, maybe, or some such.  I wish I had kept a copy of <br/>\nwhat I wrote.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he came to Santa Fe to film The Man Who Fell to Earth a couple of years <br/>\nlater, my friends were saying &quot;GO MEET HIM!&quot;  I didn&#39;t.  I was embarrassed or <br/>\nafraid he wouldn&#39;t remember me or something, and I didn&#39;t care as much then <br/>\nas I had before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe letter was sweet.  I had offered to start a fan club.  He said &quot;There is <br/>\na Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then we&#39;ll <br/>\nhave one there I suppose.  It&#39;s a little early to even think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I hope one day to get to America.  my manager tells me lots about it as he <br/>\nhas been there many times with other acts he manages.  I was watching an old <br/>\nfilm on TV the other night called &quot;No Down Payment&quot; a great film, but rather <br/>\ndepressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way of Life.  However, <br/>\nshortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American <br/>\npoet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score.  I am <br/>\nsure that that is nearer the real America...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked me to write and tell me more about myself.  I did.  I always figured <br/>\nI was a reject for being fourteen years old.  But probably he was swept away <br/>\nin being busy getting famous.  And I was getting swept away in my interest in <br/>\nfolk music, and my whirlwind of high school stuff, playing guitar, going to <br/>\nall-State, going to college early, and it was okay.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thumb-tacked the newspaper to the ceiling of my room (acoustical tile) <br/>\nand it was there for two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing about the newspaper was I got my first taste of everyday <br/>\nBritish English, neither literary nor television or movie script.  <br/>\nAdvertisements and the everyday descriptions of things.   A truck&#39;s engine <br/>\nhad caught fire.  But I had to figure that out, from a short article that <br/>\nsaid a lorry had had a fire under its bonnet.  I was thrilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nTher letter&#39;s on PITT stationery (the manager&#39;s stationery, Kenneth Pitt) and <br/>\nthere are very few typos.  Good typist.  That impressed me too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t buy any more of his albums, anyway--by the time he was openly <br/>\navailable I was immersed in folk music.  I bought some current acoustic stuff <br/>\n(Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Carol King), but mostly I was collecting field <br/>\nrecordings of traditional stuff ballads and everyday songs.  Then I got <br/>\ninvolved in Renaissance music, and I had a sexy, funny boyfriend from India <br/>\nand... one thing lead to another and here I am now hanging out with you guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11406,"nextTopicId":11384}}
