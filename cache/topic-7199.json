Chiggers <br/>\nare drawn to the warmth of the blood flow, I think, and wherever elastic <br/>\nis constricting, blood flow is heating up the skin. Your mother talked <br/>\nabout chiggers, but if she didn&#39;t have really noticeable red bumps with <br/>\ntiny little red dots in the center, she didn&#39;t have chiggers.  You can&#39;t <br/>\nmistake a chigger bite, especially after you&#39;ve been covered in them <br/>\nlike I was once at National Guard summer camp (forced to sit in the <br/>\nwoods in the dark for hours when I *knew* there were chiggers out there).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut they&#39;ll bite just any old place.  My boys got chiggers a lot in <br/>\ntheir private places, but as a girl, I never did.  Warm and tight places <br/>\nare what they seem to prefer.  Like ticks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the remedies I&#39;ve ever known about were either toxic (taking a bath <br/>\nin a high ratio of bleach to water) or a means of suffocation of the <br/>\nchigger.  That tiny little bottle of stuff was no match for the number <br/>\nof chiggers I had that one time!  I opted for the bleach, knowing how <br/>\ndangerous it was, because I was in terrible shape!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand the uproar about ticks, though.
