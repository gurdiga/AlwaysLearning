There are several of us unschoolers out here in the SE who are making choices both for right now (reducing impact) and for long-term (mini-farms, large gardens etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book I really love that Kelly Lovejoy recently recommended is &quot;The Backyard Homestead&quot; which explains how to make smaller spaces more usable for growing food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s really great to consider our own needs for moving towards a lower impact lifestyle while also considering other family member&#39;s desires and how it all plays out as we work together with different ideals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to expand my garden every year and choose things that help all of us without taking away anyone else&#39;s choice...things like rain barrels and hanging laundry to dry and other things I truly enjoy. I love talking about how the kids and dh move in and out of these interests of mine, embracing parts and leaving me to other parts like most of the beekeeping!

Thank goodness for you, Sandra Dodd, and all of the folks here who are joining our children in learning and growing together!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been making forays into the homesteading movement - my five year old daughter and I have been living in an off the grid tipi village for the past year, and loving the life this earth gifts us with!  Recently I have been looking at options for the upcoming winter, as pioneering is HARD.  I have dreams of small town or rural subsistence farming, homesteading... and of living in community with other families who unschool as well.  The two seem to go together naturally, but I&#39;m surprised at how rarely I hear talk of this lifeway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am re-reading My Antonia by Willa Cather - and would like to recommend it to anyone who read it years ago, or who never read it, and who is entranced by the pioneering folk who broke sod and during the first back-to-the-land movement in this country.  It&#39;s a classic, and can be found in any library or used book store.  I myself grew up on a &quot;subsistence farm&quot; that my mother manifested in the early eighties. It was not really successful.. but it seems to me now that a cooperative homesteading approach may be more feasible... for the radical unschooling and homesteading movements are (again) on the rise!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother wonderful reading is that of Ralph Borsodi, Flight From the City - An Experiment of Creative Living On the Land.
