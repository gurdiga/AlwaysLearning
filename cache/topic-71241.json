I&#39;ve practiced elimination communication (while using diapers) with all three of my children, who are now 7, 4, and daughter who also recently turned 2.  All of them went through a phase between 1 and 3 years of age where they refused the potty.  Sometimes it lasted many months.  I hope it can be reassuring to you that this is normal, and that this will pass.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my daughters preferred to do diaper changes standing up by around 18 months old.  We used cloth training pants which were able to pull up and down easily to facilitate this.  Right now, we are using these: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cottonbabies.com/product_info.php?cPath=139&products_id=3105\">http://www.cottonbabies.com/product_info.php?cPath=139&products_id=3105</a> and are pretty happy with them.  This is another similar product: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nickisdiapers.com/best-bottom-potty-training-kit.html.\">http://www.nickisdiapers.com/best-bottom-potty-training-kit.html.</a>  Another option would be disposable pull-ups.  With my first daughter, we had a lot less spending money and I had a sewing machine, so I sewed our own training pants.  They were not as well made as store-bought ones because they were literally the first thing I ever sewed on my own, but they worked decently enough, and were very cheap.  If you do a google search for &quot;cloth training pants tutorial&quot; you&#39;ll find lots of help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have purchased large sized absorbent cloth pads from this website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ezwhelp.com/BuyUsedWhelpingPads.htm\">http://www.ezwhelp.com/BuyUsedWhelpingPads.htm</a>  They even have used ones available at very reasonable prices.  We lay them down on top of the sheets at night, and if they have an accident it is much easier on everybody to just change out the pad than to mess with changing all the bedding in the middle of the night.  They are also useful during the day.  If she really doesn&#39;t want to wear a diaper, you can have her play on one of these without worrying about soiling carpets and couches.  We bought several so there was always a clean one handy.  These are also great as kids get older for when they are battling stomach flu.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking her to choose between two different pants to put on, or pants vs. skirt, or pink vs. purple diaper is sometimes helpful with my two year old sometimes-reluctant dresser.  Sometimes just letting her be naked for a short while - 10  minutes even - helps.  Sometimes I bring her clothes to the car, and we get dressed when we arrive some place.  Letting her go without clothes whenever it is appropriate helps, though I can see how this can be harder when sharing a living space with in-laws.  Maybe you could tell your in-laws that you are trying a new method of potty training that recommends allowing several hours of bare-bottom time each day?  I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve heard of such methods, and that might make it more palatable to them - that your daughter is naked for a clear purpose, with a clear goal in sight, rather than just one of those crazy naked hippy children!  You could even just say you were going to try it for a week and see how it goes to emphasize the temporariness of it.  And really, with a two year old, most things are temporary.  Like Sandra said, she will only be two for a year.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Yatzeck<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sarah Stone-Francisco &lt;stone_francisco@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you all for the immensely helpful perspectives and suggestions.

I listened to her, and modified our surroundings to suit her new needs. Dd also went diaper free as much as she could, wearing dresses too. <br/>\n<br/>\nif we were in a supermarket, I would speak gently with her about wearing a diaper around the shops, as an add on i would ask her if she needed to pee pee regularly and found she would hold on while we found a toilet (if one was available) and i could take off her diaper and pop her on the toilet. Speaking gently the whole time and not fretting in any way. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf a night time i would slip on a night diaper AFTER I had breastfed her naked to sleep.<br/>\nI dont need to do that anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe placed potties around our living space, have also got a toilet seat she can climb on.

My awareness of her also is very sharp I can tell when she needs to go, sleeping or not and help her to a zone where she can pee pee or poop comfortably. Be it, on some grass outside if we are playing, to a public toilet if we are out , or the potty or toilet seat at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew dd wanted to be aware of her bowel movements by the way she showed me she was ready to, by refusing diapering.

Without choices, unschooling isn&#39;t going to work well, and maybe not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my favorite Pam Sorooshian quote:  &quot;As we get older and our kids grow up, we eventually come to realize that all the big things in our lives are really the direct result of how we&#39;ve handled all the little things.&quot; ï¿½Pam Sorooshian, June 4, 2007<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283841567,"authorName":"Brynna Rafferty-Brown","from":"Brynna Rafferty-Brown &lt;braff16@...&gt;","profile":"brynraff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Fun with diapers and dressing","postDate":"1366274410","msgId":71261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQjgxNzhXWkhqcVlYK19VQmNLZW8xWF9rN1h2VTJWeDlhcHcydW89cmZTNmUwQW1jQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71260,"nextInTopic":71262,"prevInTime":71260,"nextInTime":71262,"topicId":71241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know exactly what you mean about adopting a relaxed approach to EC.

I tried going diaper-free when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1103135144\">I know exactly what you mean about adopting a relaxed approach to EC. Our<br/>\nlittle one is 14 months old and we&#39;ve done the same. I tried going<br/>\ndiaper-free when she was tiny and found myself walking around the house<br/>\nslightly more tense than usual constantly wondering if she was about to pee<br/>\nand whether or not I would be paying enough attention to figure out what<br/>\ncue she was giving me. It didn&#39;t take long for me to decide that having a<br/>\nrelaxed mum around was more important than going diaper-free!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was about six months I read a few blogs etc. (tribalbaby.org was<br/>\nmy favourite!) about EC being mainly about communication rather than being<br/>\ndiaper-free per se and that some people who fully practice EC from birth<br/>\nwill also have their little ones in diapers the whole time. It gave me a<br/>\nwhole new perspective on EC and I decided to forget about her being<br/>\ndiaper-free and focus on building our communication. Around that time it<br/>\nwas still pretty clear when she&#39;d want to do a poo, so we started picking<br/>\nher up when we could see she needed to go, taking her nappy off and holding<br/>\nher over a bucket. We didn&#39;t have as much luck with wees, but she now knows<br/>\nthat if she looks at me or my husband when she&#39;s ready for a poo we&#39;ll help<br/>\nher out so she doesn&#39;t have to get mucky stuff in her nappy :-) we&#39;ve only<br/>\nmissed a handful since.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround six months she also started not liking to lie down to have her<br/>\ndiaper changed. Like some other people have already suggested, we took that<br/>\non board and I tried sitting her on my lap to change her nappy instead<br/>\nwhich she seemed much happier with (along with the occasional crawling<br/>\ndiaper-change on the run!). It was a bit tricky to start with (especially<br/>\nfor other members of the family!) but she hasn&#39;t had a diaper changed lying<br/>\ndown since. Knowing my daughter and how independent and curious about the<br/>\nworld she already feels it just felt more respectful to let her keep<br/>\nplaying or watching the world rather than trying to get her to make it<br/>\neasier for me by lying down.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s also very recently decided she doesn&#39;t like having her diaper on too<br/>\noften. So we experimented with letting her have it off some of the time.<br/>\nShe still sleeps with us and I noticed that at night she would get<br/>\nincreasingly uncomfortable until she cried out and then drenched her<br/>\ndiaper. With a bit of an uneasy smile from my husband I suggested we try<br/>\nletting her go diaper-free over night. I put a few extra towels under the<br/>\nsheet and another one under the two of us for emergency pee-catching... She<br/>\npeed on me once early on and hasn&#39;t since (it&#39;s been about two weeks).<br/>\nInstead I keep a bucket by the bed and when she starts to toss and turn I<br/>\nhold her over it, make a &#39;ssss&#39; sound and most of the time she&#39;ll pee and<br/>\nthen go back to a much sounder sleep. It turns out she also doesn&#39;t like<br/>\npeeing when sitting in her car seat (which we worked out by stopping when<br/>\nshe was upset. She didn&#39;t seem to want a feed and her nappy wasn&#39;t wet, but<br/>\ngiven the chance she&#39;d happily pee by the side of the road).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the part of our experience that I thought might be helpful is that<br/>\nif I had paid attention to the &#39;rules&#39; about when little ones are &#39;meant&#39;<br/>\nto potty-train there&#39;s no way I would have tried letting her go diaper-free<br/>\nover night! But every child is different and I don&#39;t see the point of<br/>\ntrying to force them to do things too quickly or to try and slow them down.<br/>\nI think it makes a lot more sense to respond to them when and where they&#39;re<br/>\nat as best we can (that&#39;s why I joined this list :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong that line of thought (you might have done this already), maybe your<br/>\ndaughter is ready to move onto something new? Have you tried asking her if<br/>\nshe wants to try using a potty? Or maybe the big toilet? If neither of<br/>\nthem, then maybe wearing training underwear?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought I had was that if her wearing a diaper is important to<br/>\nyou, maybe you could play with it rather than trying to impose it. (*Playful<br/>\nParenting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.playfulparenting.com/\">http://www.playfulparenting.com/</a>&gt;* is one of my favourite<br/>\nbooks!). Maybe you could make up some silly (or not so silly) ideas about<br/>\ndifferent ways you could get the diaper on her together. I don&#39;t have a two<br/>\nyear old yet, but I&#39;m trying to imagine what I would do if I took our<br/>\ncurrent approach with our daughter once she can say a few more words. I<br/>\nonly joined this list recently, but my impression of radical unschooling is<br/>\nthat one of its premises is that it&#39;s based on the idea of grounding our<br/>\nfamilies&#39; lives in joy. I can&#39;t think of many other ways of making trying<br/>\nto wear a diaper more joyful than by making it into a game that will let<br/>\nyou both laugh about some silly ideas together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last quick point about wearing clothes... maybe you could just let her<br/>\nchoose which clothes (if any!) she wants to wear? Even if it&#39;s just for a<br/>\nfew weeks (if you don&#39;t feel comfortable about deciding to do it forever)<br/>\nOne of my favourite childhood stories is of a time when my mum went away<br/>\nfor work for two weeks. When she came back she asked my teacher how I&#39;d<br/>\nbeen in kindergarten while she was away. My teacher commented that I&#39;d worn<br/>\nsome interesting outfits. It turns out my dad (who really doesn&#39;t care much<br/>\nabout what other people think) had let me choose what to wear. I&#39;d chosen a<br/>\nwhole range of weird and wonderful colours, including a few days of not<br/>\nwanting to wear any pants at all. I don&#39;t remember what season it was, but<br/>\nI&#39;m sure if it was winter and I&#39;d ended up too cold I would have learnt<br/>\nfrom it and chosen to wear pants the next day. It didn&#39;t seem to do me any<br/>\nharm and I love remembering it as a story now - a reminder of how free and<br/>\nstrong-willed I was as a little one, just like my daughter is now :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLombok Kids    www.iced.org.au/lombok-kids<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":473433070,"authorName":"Sarah McCaffrey","from":"Sarah McCaffrey &lt;vardenroad@...&gt;","profile":"didsburyduo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Fun with diapers and dressing","postDate":"1366269614","msgId":71260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDE0MkYxQkEwREUyMTNGNTU4Qjg1NkJDODBDRjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":71259,"nextInTopic":71261,"prevInTime":71259,"nextInTime":71261,"topicId":71241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest didn t like getting dressed at around that age, so I took his clothes outside with us with all the other things we needed for the day.

It was a beautiful tool for helping us pay attention to her cues and the way she was communicating consciously or unconsciously from the beginning. Around 18 months she started refusing to sit on the potty. We never went diaper free, which is probably one reason why EC didn&#39;t end up working the way I had expected it to; I&#39;ve let go of those expectations, though, and am just grateful that she pees and poops. In the last couple months (she turned two last weekend) she has really, really started fighting having her diaper changed. As long as she doesn&#39;t have to lie down, taking them off is fine, but kicks, wriggles and repeatedly declares No! when we try to put the new one on.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; This strong emotional assertion of her desires and will has been a huge learning opportunity for me. At first, when she would struggle, I would approach it from a perspective like, &quot;I&#39;m the boss, this is going to happen because I say so.&quot; Not very team oriented and it never felt very good. That approach set us up as adversaries and always led to me shouting and strong-arming, and Sparrow in tears. I would feel absolutely awful afterwards and seek assurance from my mom and husband that I&#39;m not a bad mother. A bit like the &quot;there, there, you&#39;re doing the best you can, being a mother is so hard,&quot; platitudes that I feel gratefully wary of after reading this list.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Though I was seeking assurances, deep down I knew that I Wasn&#39;t doing the best I could, that there Had to be a better way. A few weeks ago I made a commitment to myself not to lose it again over diaper changing. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been doing well. But we still often have difficulty getting her diapered. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; A couple examples: One morning the whole process took between one and two hours, so we missed tot gym and our backup plan of meeting people at the children&#39;s nature museum. It did end in tears, but they were mine. (She cried, too, but not because I was physically forcing a diaper on her, instead she was crying because i wasn&#39;t letting her do other things until she had a diaper on, like crawl under our covers, play in her crib, or go upstairs to eat). However, I never once lost my temper, shouted, or held her down to put a diaper on her. I focused on deep breathing, and a couple times I walked away to break the cycle of our mutually building frustration. Finally, feeling at my wits end I called my mom with tears in my eyes. Funny, she just said a couple words to Sparrow who asked to go upstairs for apple sauce once again, and I said the same thing I had been repeating, &quot;yes, absolutely you can, as soon as we get a diaper on.&quot; And she said ok and laid down on the bed. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Another time, I had another opportunity to be even gentler. No struggle, she wanted to get under the covers without a diaper, so I just went under there, too, and put the diaper on under there: no struggle at all for either of us. The larger lesson seemed to be more of a transformation in my way of thinking. I&#39;m letting go of my attachment to the idea that, as the parent, it&#39;s my job to ensure that I&#39;m &quot;listened to and minded,&quot; which I Know is coming from the leftover voices of my own parents in my head. And, in its place is a much kinder perspective that, as her parent, it&#39;s my job to see that she has a safe, supportive environment for learning.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But we don&#39;t always have two hours or the covers to get under. And once her diaper is on, getting dressed is often the same type of struggle. Sometimes I can find that magic thing that she gets interested in enough to let me change her diaper and dress her quickly, gently and in a flow, but more often than not, I cannot find the magic, and while I&#39;ve changed and remain patient, it still feels like force. (Just no longer the kind that comes from impatience and frustration.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I know I/we can do even better than this and I look forward to your help in figuring that out. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So far, two of the biggest lessons for me have been: 1) getting someplace on time is not worth compromising our relationship, and 2) that I can always remember to think of two options and pick the best one. And, the next time I can think of an even better option. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So, I would love to know if people have solutions that have worked for them:  I&#39;m all ears/eyes!

Obviously he&#39;s that bit younger, but sometimes he doesn&#39;t like to sit on the potty either. Sometimes that just means he doesn&#39;t need to go, but sometimes switching it up and holding him over the toilet or even sitting him on it (on the big seat, held securely, or you could use a child seat thingy). So if you haven&#39;t tried potty alternatives (even just going outside!) that might be an option. Might she be telling you that she wants to potty learn now? Could it be worth going to training pants or straight to knickers and prepare to clean up some accidents? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as nappies go, I often put Leon&#39;s on while he&#39;s on the move - he doesn&#39;t mind the nappy, but he&#39;s not keen on the staying still. Singing a song sometimes helps too - we have a couple of songs and sometimes one works and sometimes the other. Or just backing off altogether for a couple of minutes and trying again when he&#39;s involved in something and I can squiggle it onto him without stopping his play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSinging works well for dressing for us, too. Or, again, dressing him around whatever he&#39;s playing with. Or playing the &quot;Captain Leon&#39;s Adventures in Sleeveland&quot; game (narrating stories about his hand going exploring in Sleeveland, with over dramatic voices and much cheering when the brave hand emerges). Or putting my hand down the sleeve so I can grab his hand and pull the sleeve over it rather than pushing. Or just not putting whatever item of clothing it is on. (I get occasional tellings-off from old ladies about Leon not wearing a hat, but if I&#39;ve put it on him and he&#39;s taken it off I figure he doesn&#39;t want it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 17 Apr 2013, at 15:50, Sarah Stone-Francisco &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stone_francisco@...\">stone_francisco@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We practiced a very relaxed form of elimination communication (EC) with Sparrow from two weeks old. It was a beautiful tool for helping us pay attention to her cues and the way she was communicating consciously or unconsciously from the beginning. Around 18 months she started refusing to sit on the potty. We never went diaper free, which is probably one reason why EC didn&#39;t end up working the way I had expected it to; I&#39;ve let go of those expectations, though, and am just grateful that she pees and poops. In the last couple months (she turned two last weekend) she has really, really started fighting having her diaper changed. As long as she doesn&#39;t have to lie down, taking them off is fine, but kicks, wriggles and repeatedly declares No! when we try to put the new one on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This strong emotional assertion of her desires and will has been a huge learning opportunity for me. At first, when she would struggle, I would approach it from a perspective like, &quot;I&#39;m the boss, this is going to happen because I say so.&quot; Not very team oriented and it never felt very good. That approach set us up as adversaries and always led to me shouting and strong-arming, and Sparrow in tears. I would feel absolutely awful afterwards and seek assurance from my mom and husband that I&#39;m not a bad mother. A bit like the &quot;there, there, you&#39;re doing the best you can, being a mother is so hard,&quot; platitudes that I feel gratefully wary of after reading this list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Though I was seeking assurances, deep down I knew that I Wasn&#39;t doing the best I could, that there Had to be a better way. A few weeks ago I made a commitment to myself not to lose it again over diaper changing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing well. But we still often have difficulty getting her diapered. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A couple examples: One morning the whole process took between one and two hours, so we missed tot gym and our backup plan of meeting people at the children&#39;s nature museum. It did end in tears, but they were mine. (She cried, too, but not because I was physically forcing a diaper on her, instead she was crying because i wasn&#39;t letting her do other things until she had a diaper on, like crawl under our covers, play in her crib, or go upstairs to eat). However, I never once lost my temper, shouted, or held her down to put a diaper on her. I focused on deep breathing, and a couple times I walked away to break the cycle of our mutually building frustration. Finally, feeling at my wits end I called my mom with tears in my eyes. Funny, she just said a couple words to Sparrow who asked to go upstairs for apple sauce once again, and I said the same thing I had been repeating, &quot;yes, absolutely you can, as soon as we get a diaper on.&quot; And she said ok and laid down on the bed. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another time, I had another opportunity to be even gentler. No struggle, she wanted to get under the covers without a diaper, so I just went under there, too, and put the diaper on under there: no struggle at all for either of us. The larger lesson seemed to be more of a transformation in my way of thinking. I&#39;m letting go of my attachment to the idea that, as the parent, it&#39;s my job to ensure that I&#39;m &quot;listened to and minded,&quot; which I Know is coming from the leftover voices of my own parents in my head. And, in its place is a much kinder perspective that, as her parent, it&#39;s my job to see that she has a safe, supportive environment for learning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But we don&#39;t always have two hours or the covers to get under. And once her diaper is on, getting dressed is often the same type of struggle. Sometimes I can find that magic thing that she gets interested in enough to let me change her diaper and dress her quickly, gently and in a flow, but more often than not, I cannot find the magic, and while I&#39;ve changed and remain patient, it still feels like force. (Just no longer the kind that comes from impatience and frustration.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know I/we can do even better than this and I look forward to your help in figuring that out. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far, two of the biggest lessons for me have been: 1) getting someplace on time is not worth compromising our relationship, and 2) that I can always remember to think of two options and pick the best one. And, the next time I can think of an even better option. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, I would love to know if people have solutions that have worked for them:  I&#39;m all ears/eyes! I&#39;d love to find compassionate and/or creative ways to make diapering and dressing something she enjoys - or at least tolerates - and doesn&#39;t run away from or suffer through while crying.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am super grateful for the &quot;voices&quot; of this list&#39;s writers in my head nudging me along in a more positive, peaceful, joyful direction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; love, sarah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS: I know Sparrow isn&#39;t yet school age, but I didn&#39;t want to miss out on Sandra, Pam(s), Joyce, and Alex&#39;s perspective by posting at AlwaysUnschooled, even though I appreciate that discussion, too.

Plan to spend more time at home. Plan to have a naked 2yo running around for at least part of every day, while you&#39;re at it. Think about when she&#39;s likely to poop and aim for diapers then, otherwise, have lots of towels. Pick her up and put her in a better place to pee when you see her start - on a towel, on the porch, in the kitchen, even outside if that&#39;s an option (maybe not, depends on where you live). Don&#39;t make a big deal about a little pee, though. It&#39;s just pee. You can rent a steam-cleaner in six months if you need to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, learn how to diaper on the go - it&#39;s doable, but it takes some practice and a relaxed sense of fun on your part. Lots of little kids won&#39;t lie down for a diaper change - they&#39;re too busy, and don&#39;t like the helplessness of it all. I found vinyl diaper covers with cloth inserts were handy for mobile diaper changes at one point - they went on and off easily. But once it got hot Mo figured out how to take them off and I didn&#39;t fuss about the things. I just made sure she was covered when she was going to poo. Reducing the number of changes helped with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nClothes... it used to be even boys wore dresses when they were in diapers - it&#39;s the source of an old insult &quot;unbreeched boy&quot; as in &quot;you&#39;re not even potty trained&quot;. Look for short, sleeveless dresses that barely cover the diaper. That&#39;s another advantage to staying home, if you live someplace cold, or moving into winter right now. If you need company, consider inviting people over, or look for ways to get out on your own now and then. Little kids often don&#39;t need nearly as much social time as their parents! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Around 18 months she started refusing to sit on the potty.

She would resist clothes and diapers.  I thought about what a neat experience it would be for her to feel so free and to experience the feeling of the air, the couch, the carpet, the grass, the swing, etc on her naked little body.  I let her go completely buff as often as possible.  She just reveled in that feeling and my husband & I would smile & laugh watching her feel so much joy!  (She also started playing with her genitals a lot during this phase.  That wasn&#39;t as funny to see!  I did not want to shame her about it so I would just put a blanket over her which she would sometimes leave or throw off.  If she wouldn&#39;t keep the blanket on and I didn&#39;t want to be a witness I would busy myself in the kitchen.)  I don&#39;t remember her ever having an accident although there probably were a few but we had hardwood floors and a carpet cleaner.  Her little brother was around 1 at this time so often I would strip them both naked and they would play in our fenced yard this way (accidents? - no problem out there).  We had a pond and they loved to slide their naked little bodies in and splash around.  Have you ever gone skinny dipping?  I would recommend it if you ever get the chance!  The water feels amazing on your skin!  They got tanned from head to toe, literally, and I would call them my little bronzed beauties!  There were koi fish, algae and a water fall to play with and I just loved watching my little bohemians!  Leaving that yard was the saddest part when we sold that house.  We had a fence and it was fairly private and so far as I know nobody was ever offended by their extended nakedness.  And it saved on laundry!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we wanted to go somewhere it was usually no problem getting them dressed and diapered because they had plenty of naked time and they understood that they&#39;d be more comfortable at the library or grocery store with clothes on.  My daughter has enjoyed picking out her own clothes and dressing herself since she was 2 & it has always been very entertaining.  That little girl puts together much more creative and interesting outfits than I would come up with!  Many times things matched and coordinated in the most interesting ways.  Other times things were wildly disjointed but the key was to accept and appreciate whatever it was she chose.  We still do that accept now that she&#39;s 10 she&#39;s much more skilled and I often ask her advice when I&#39;m getting dressed.  And I&#39;ve had comments from many people who have enjoyed seeing her creations.  The only time I offer an opinion is if she has chosen a sundress and it&#39;s 20 degrees outside, I will mention the weather and suggest she put a long sleeve shirt and pants on under or something like that.  No problem since she is the architect of those modifications.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe potty trained herself at two (pee - poop took a little longer) without a single word from me.  I never, not once, asked her to sit on the potty.  We had a little one in the bathroom but it was ignored.  She was usually in the bathroom with me when I went.  One day, shortly after her second birthday, she waddled her naked little body over to the big toilet, climbed on, straddled it and peed.  That was it.  From then on whenever she had to go she just walked on over and did her thing.  She was tiny so it&#39;s amazing that she never fell in!  She had been obsessed with playing with her dishes in the toilet for quite awhile so I kept it clean and it was just another piece of her life, not something she was ever afraid of or anything.  The whole experience of her being naked and potty training is such a happy memory for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my son at this same time I got really good at sneaking up behind him, pulling the old diaper off and replacing it while he was standing & playing.  As long as he didn&#39;t have to stop what he was doing he was cool with.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Fun with diapers and dressing","postDate":"1366215840","msgId":71243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjYyMTU4NDAuMTM2MDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQwMy1FQVMyNzBERDYyMDczNDJBODdEQjBBRjM3MTlEQ0UwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQwMy1FQVMyNzBERDYyMDczNDJBODdEQjBBRjM3MTlEQ0UwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":71242,"nextInTopic":71247,"prevInTime":71242,"nextInTime":71244,"topicId":71241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my daughter did not want to wear diapers we went diaper free as much as we could.

It was a beautiful tool for helping us pay attention to her cues and the way she was communicating consciously or unconsciously from the beginning. Around 18 months she started refusing to sit on the potty. We never went diaper free, which is probably one reason why EC didn&#39;t end up working the way I had expected it to; I&#39;ve let go of those expectations, though, and am just grateful that she pees and poops. In the last couple months (she turned two last weekend) she has really, really started fighting having her diaper changed. As long as she doesn&#39;t have to lie down, taking them off is fine, but kicks, wriggles and repeatedly declares No! when we try to put the new one on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis strong emotional assertion of her desires and will has been a huge learning opportunity for me. At first, when she would struggle, I would approach it from a perspective like, &quot;I&#39;m the boss, this is going to happen because I say so.&quot; Not very team oriented and it never felt very good. That approach set us up as adversaries and always led to me shouting and strong-arming, and Sparrow in tears. I would feel absolutely awful afterwards and seek assurance from my mom and husband that I&#39;m not a bad mother. A bit like the &quot;there, there, you&#39;re doing the best you can, being a mother is so hard,&quot; platitudes that I feel gratefully wary of after reading this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I was seeking assurances, deep down I knew that I Wasn&#39;t doing the best I could, that there Had to be a better way. A few weeks ago I made a commitment to myself not to lose it again over diaper changing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing well. But we still often have difficulty getting her diapered. <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple examples: One morning the whole process took between one and two hours, so we missed tot gym and our backup plan of meeting people at the children&#39;s nature museum. It did end in tears, but they were mine. (She cried, too, but not because I was physically forcing a diaper on her, instead she was crying because i wasn&#39;t letting her do other things until she had a diaper on, like crawl under our covers, play in her crib, or go upstairs to eat). However, I never once lost my temper, shouted, or held her down to put a diaper on her. I focused on deep breathing, and a couple times I walked away to break the cycle of our mutually building frustration. Finally, feeling at my wits end I called my mom with tears in my eyes. Funny, she just said a couple words to Sparrow who asked to go upstairs for apple sauce once again, and I said the same thing I had been repeating, &quot;yes, absolutely you can, as soon as we get a diaper on.&quot; And she said ok and laid down on the bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, I had another opportunity to be even gentler. No struggle, she wanted to get under the covers without a diaper, so I just went under there, too, and put the diaper on under there: no struggle at all for either of us. The larger lesson seemed to be more of a transformation in my way of thinking. I&#39;m letting go of my attachment to the idea that, as the parent, it&#39;s my job to ensure that I&#39;m &quot;listened to and minded,&quot; which I Know is coming from the leftover voices of my own parents in my head. And, in its place is a much kinder perspective that, as her parent, it&#39;s my job to see that she has a safe, supportive environment for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we don&#39;t always have two hours or the covers to get under. And once her diaper is on, getting dressed is often the same type of struggle. Sometimes I can find that magic thing that she gets interested in enough to let me change her diaper and dress her quickly, gently and in a flow, but more often than not, I cannot find the magic, and while I&#39;ve changed and remain patient, it still feels like force. (Just no longer the kind that comes from impatience and frustration.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I/we can do even better than this and I look forward to your help in figuring that out. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, two of the biggest lessons for me have been: 1) getting someplace on time is not worth compromising our relationship, and 2) that I can always remember to think of two options and pick the best one. And, the next time I can think of an even better option. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would love to know if people have solutions that have worked for them:  I&#39;m all ears/eyes! I&#39;d love to find compassionate and/or creative ways to make diapering and dressing something she enjoys - or at least tolerates - and doesn&#39;t run away from or suffer through while crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am super grateful for the &quot;voices&quot; of this list&#39;s writers in my head nudging me along in a more positive, peaceful, joyful direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, sarah<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I know Sparrow isn&#39;t yet school age, but I didn&#39;t want to miss out on Sandra, Pam(s), Joyce, and Alex&#39;s perspective by posting at AlwaysUnschooled, even though I appreciate that discussion, too.
