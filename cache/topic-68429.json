I agree that children sin.  However, I don&#39;t think the answer is ME and my teaching.  The answer is the Jesus and the Holy Spirit guiding their lives.  My job is to introduce them to God, explain to them my understanding of the Scriptures and dialogue with them about that, and then trust that as they get to know him, they will be led by the Spirit themselves.  No amount of teaching can force them into a relationship with God.  They have to choose that for themselves.  And most topics aren&#39;t addressed directly in the Bible.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go,&quot; was understood by the ancient Israelites to mean to train him up in the way HE should go- according to his natural skills and interests, because God gives us those for a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeut: 6:4  &quot;You shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot at the kitchen table from text books, but as a living breathing part of the way you interact.  It&#39;s something you model and live. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the ancient rabbis would say, when teaching a child, &quot;We are learning together,&quot; and would teach by asking questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":318828203,"authorName":"BetteAnne","from":"&quot;BetteAnne&quot; &lt;carl-betteanne@...&gt;","profile":"carlbetteanne81382","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Unsubscribe","postDate":"1343522530","msgId":68437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp2MjB0Mitra2hiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGp2MThsdStzajN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68432,"nextInTopic":68445,"prevInTime":68436,"nextInTime":68438,"topicId":68429,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Honestly???????
