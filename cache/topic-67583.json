But unschooling doesn&#39;t make one immune from the world around.  His grandfather would have been that way with or without the unschooling.  And I don&#39;t think a family can, or should, say &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers, and so you (friends, relatives, neighbors) must either become unschoolers too, or stay away from us.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for information to show your dad to request that he not be verbally bullying--something about the effect of negative words--might be more helpful, both to your own recovery and your relationship with him, and to his with his grandchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelling him it&#39;s because you&#39;re unschoolers isn&#39;t probably the swiftest move.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to give him something to read, though, about unschooling, Pam Laricchia&#39;s new book might be short enough that he would read it.  It&#39;s clear and inspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/</a>  (upper left; I LOVE the intro page to Pam&#39;s site, so am not sending you straight to the book page)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect\">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>\nThere might be ideas in there to help, too.

And a child with two attentive parents who want his life to be peaceful can endure occasional old-timey negativity from a grandparent without being scarred.  If a parent reacts sharply and too strongly, it&#39;s probably the parent who needs to recover from childhood hurts, rather than the grandchild who needs to be protected.<br/>\n<br/>\nA grandparent has a relationship to a grandchild.  I think that for &quot;the middle man&quot; to absolutely cut off communication is more likely to be for meanness to the parent than kindness to the child.  That is not healthy, right, or good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my mother in law was dismissive of our kids, they were prepared in advance, and they were comforted afterwards.  They didn&#39;t take her seriously.   They weren&#39;t dependent on her for their self-esteem, for permissions, or for anything else.They were polite to her, knowing that she had had a harsh life, that she had been a harsh mother to their dad, and knowing above all that they were only with her for a very short time.   And for them it was kind of interesting, to be around someone who wasn&#39;t so directly connected with them, but who was going more by a script, and being critical.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":311108332,"authorName":"Eva","from":"&quot;Eva&quot; &lt;evawitsel@...&gt;","profile":"evawitsel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Disrespectful grandparent....","postDate":"1339392956","msgId":67594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpyNDAzcysxNjFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpyMjk2ditqZ2s5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67593,"nextInTopic":67597,"prevInTime":67593,"nextInTime":67595,"topicId":67583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Otherwise, you&#39;re aiding and abetting the bullying by repeatedly putting your kid in a situation where he&#39;s going to get hurt. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know how I can make my dad understand.. and I am not sure he wold ever change at this point...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t make another person understand and you certainly can&#39;t change someone else. You can set things up so that your kids have more choices, including the option of avoiding people who will bully and torment them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that you have an idealized view of &quot;the value of family&quot; in your mind and are hoping to build that. Sometimes it&#39;s better to grieve for those fantasies and let them go and build better relationships with other people. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219062905,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;laster99@...&gt;","profile":"laster99@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Disrespectful grandparent....","postDate":"1339336735","msgId":67583,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpyMjk2ditqZ2s5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67585,"prevInTime":67582,"nextInTime":67584,"topicId":67583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are pretty new to unschooling... well, I guess we have been slowly making changes over a long period of time, but I just recently considered us unschoolers.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1437959227\">We are pretty new to unschooling... well, I guess we have been slowly making changes over a long period of time, but I just recently considered us unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the understanding that respect is one of the main keys in the unschooling philosophy.  Well, here is the situation...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents are all for the concept of freedom in learning.  The problem we have is with my parents (particularly my dad) not being respectful to my children.  My 10yo son has grown used to it over a period of years, but my 6yo son is pretty sensitive.  He has gotten to the point that he doesn&#39;t want to even be around my dad anymore (and I can&#39;t say I blame him! &lt;sigh&gt;) Dad calls it &quot;teasing&quot; and I think he thinks he is &quot;making him tough&quot; because he thinks I baby him.  My son is what I would call a typical boy... energetic and likes all things boyish.  I literally feel like he is being picked on and bullied by my own dad!!  We have tried talking to him about it a time or 2, but he thinks WE are the ones being rediculous!!!  I don&#39;t understand why it should be acceptable for my son to be called names like &quot;sissy&quot;, &quot;Mama&#39;s boy&quot; and told that he is &quot;acting like a whiney 2 year old&quot; by anyone... especially by an adult AND his own grandfather! My dad is literally destroying their relationship and it is breaking my heart...  FYI, this is not new.  I grew up with this sort of thing and it brings up bad memories, but I am an adult and can ignore/handle it, but I don&#39;t want my kids to put up with it.  I don&#39;t know how I can make my dad understand.. and I am not sure he wold ever change at this point...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone ever deal with this sort of problem?  Any advice on how to begin solving this problem??</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67531,"nextTopicId":67604}}
