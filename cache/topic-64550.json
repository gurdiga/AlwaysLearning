I realized that my kids had been learning when<br/>\nwe took a homemade pizza kit (risen dough and toppings) over to a friend&#39;s<br/>\nhouse so that our kids could make pizza together.

We actually enjoy math theory (hubby and I were math geeks) and I<br/>\nfound a curriculum that talks about how algebraic equations can be found in<br/>\nreal life.  My daughter (and husband) actually enjoys what I call plug and<br/>\nchug math--lots of equations.  They both get some sort of satisfaction from<br/>\ncompleting a bunch of math equations.  I think it is sort of like<br/>\nmeditation to them.   This is not how my son and I relate to numbers.  We<br/>\nalso have a bunch of books that talk about math and how it applies to life,<br/>\nand art, not to mention all of the websites that show nifty math in<br/>\naction.  We are very booky people that love running to the internet or<br/>\nbooks for whatever question pops into our heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a computer guy for a living and almost majored in math in<br/>\ncollege.  When I discovered math theory and geometry, I discovered that I<br/>\nam actually very good at thinking mathematically, but find plug numbers<br/>\ninto equations very tedious.  I like math that you can build with...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t touch any kind of math curriculum until I hit a road block when<br/>\ntrying to answer my kid&#39;s questions about math.  We have a bunch of<br/>\ntextbooks (mostly college level) and some curriculum that we use as<br/>\nreference material.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ^^^^^OH!<br/>\n&gt; From the beginning of your post I was thinking about philosophy.

I only took one class in college that I would not have<br/>\ntaken if I weren&#39;t required to do so to complete my degree.  It was my only<br/>\n&#39;c&#39; on my transcript.  I loved essay tests and discussion.  Friends of mine<br/>\ntook only classes that they knew they could get an &#39;a&#39; in and tried to<br/>\navoid writing any papers as well.  I had placed myself in true poverty to<br/>\npursue my college education, so I wanted to get my money&#39;s worth.  My GPA<br/>\nprobably suffered a bit because I didn&#39;t just take easy classes, but I<br/>\nenjoyed every class I took except for that one.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******I bet your kids are learning to ask their own questions, gradually<br/>\n&gt; but solidly, in ways they won&#39;t forget, about whether they&#39;re learning, and<br/>\n&gt; how, and what.***********<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now that they are teenagers they often challenge me intellectually.

What really flabbergasts me is when a homeschooled child<br/>\nis forced to adhere to some kind of schedule and testing, instead of being<br/>\ngiven the freedom to learn a subject (even if it is one that they are<br/>\nassigned) and go through the material until they actually know it.  Why<br/>\nhomeschool if you aren&#39;t actually allowing your child to learn in a genuine<br/>\nway?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to say that I feel that unschooling can lead to a person who<br/>\nis a better citizen because most of the unschooled kids that I have met<br/>\nactually know how to absorb information and assess that information better<br/>\nthan many other young people their same age.

When<br/>\nsomeone seems to question their choices or to just point out that there are<br/>\nother possible choices, this new believer often becomes angry and<br/>\ndefensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that in an unschooling context, one of things that I learned<br/>\nslowly, sometimes painfully slowly, is to be comfortable with a lack of<br/>\n&quot;Knowing&quot; and rather to work cultivating my faith and trust in the<br/>\nindomitable will of my children to explore and learn and grow (in all<br/>\nsenses of the word), sometimes in spite of myself and my fears.  As an<br/>\nunschooler, I learned to be comfortable with the fact that I may not have a<br/>\nlot of answers when I want them.  I learned to ask different questions,<br/>\nsuch as:<br/>\nAre my children happy?<br/>\nAre the individuals in our family connected and engaged with each other,<br/>\nwith the world?<br/>\nDo my children still have that innate curiosity that drove them to pull<br/>\nthemselves up off of the floor and walk so that they could climb up on the<br/>\nchair and see what was in the top of the cabinet in the kitchen?<br/>\nHow can I help maintain that curiosity and cultivate it in myself?<br/>\nWhen I sit back and look at where we have been and where we are, do my<br/>\nchildren have a wealth of experiences that add up to a knowledge of<br/>\nthemselves and the world around them?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo my children feel that they are capable of anything that they put their<br/>\nmind to?<br/>\nWhen my daughter wanted to make a vegetarian bacon substitute she looked up<br/>\nsome things on the internet and proceeded to practice alchemy in my<br/>\nkitchen.  She then took some tofu out of the fridge and marinated it in her<br/>\nconcoction.  The next morning, she cooked it and it actually tasted like<br/>\nbacon!  The best part is that she has never eaten real bacon, but still<br/>\nmanaged to make tofu taste like bacon!!!  Oh, she also wrote down her<br/>\nrecipe so that she could repeat her success, and we have done so several<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it hard to remember when she couldn&#39;t write, it was something that<br/>\nshe took to, we always had pens, pencils, crayons, paints, markers and lots<br/>\nof paper around and I had some &#39;copy books&#39; laying around (something that I<br/>\nbought before I had a better clue).  One day, I saw her playing and writing<br/>\nin the copy books.  I watched with fascination because she was actually<br/>\ntracing the letters. I thought that she would be drawing in the pages<br/>\n(equally as good) like she had in the past with coloring books, but this<br/>\ntime she was tracing letters.  She asked what the letters were and I<br/>\nrecited for her what they were.  I think that she was three.  I have<br/>\nspelled hundreds of words for her and was a little sad once she learned how<br/>\nto use spell check.  I have always spelled words for my children without<br/>\ntrying to make them &#39;sound it out&#39;.  I have explained why the words are<br/>\nspelled the way they are, when I knew the information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the other question that I asked often, once I realized how<br/>\nimportant a question it was, is, &quot;Am I being helpful and facilitative of my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s learning and not an obstacle with what I think are good ideas?&quot;<br/>\nI am still de-schooling and I have been doing this for 10 years.  It has<br/>\ngotten easier, but I am stubborn and perhaps think a little too much of my<br/>\nown ideas.  Now though, my kids tell me when I am being too schoolish,<br/>\nusually with a look like I have hit my head a little too hard.  :)  Though<br/>\nsometimes, my ideas are good ones and we go off on an adventure that I<br/>\nactually dreamed up, usually this is a trip to some nifty place that we all<br/>\nfind interesting or some cooking project.  I am happy that my children feel<br/>\nthat they are free to express their opinions to me about my ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was not reading by himself at the age of ten, I took a lot of<br/>\ndeep breaths and read other people&#39;s stories about their sons and daughters<br/>\nand how one day they just started reading; all without pain and bad<br/>\nfeelings because they were &#39;late&#39; to read.  And one day, my son did read<br/>\nand now he reads everything he wants to and then often he will tell me all<br/>\nabout some subject that I would have never read about myself, and I feel<br/>\nenriched and blessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, the upshot is that having faith in my children&#39;s drive and desire<br/>\nto learn and re-kindling my own love of learning and interest in things has<br/>\nbeen a work in progress.  Realizing that learning is process and not<br/>\nproduct (or papers or dioramas or some other schoolish thing) came to me<br/>\none day when I was discussing my own school experience with a friend.  She<br/>\nwas going on about &#39;demonstration of skills and knowledge&#39; and the<br/>\nimportance of homework.  I realized that one the things that made me hate<br/>\nmost of my school days was this inane &#39;demonstration&#39; business and the busy<br/>\nwork.  I loved learning about things and I loved creating real<br/>\nthings--clothes, crochet projects, dances, singing in chorus, performing in<br/>\nplays, fixing a flat tire, things that were real in the world and useful or<br/>\nsomehow brought joy (or maybe some relief in the case of the flat tire),<br/>\nnot some stupid canned &#39;lesson&#39; that had some pre-determined product in<br/>\nmind, or just discussing what I had learned and how it fit with other<br/>\nthings that I already knew or how it challenged what I thought that I<br/>\nknew.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomework made me hate math until I was in college.  Hundreds of problems to<br/>\ncomplete, even after I got the concept and was able to do whatever<br/>\noperation that we were studying, all just to be able to show that we were<br/>\n&#39;productive&#39;....<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids are learning algebra, because they find it interesting.  I<br/>\nbought some curriculum and books about algebra and manipulatives and<br/>\ncalculators and they are there when they are interested.  I am here to<br/>\nanswer questions or discuss things as they wish to engage.  We have gone<br/>\nthrough curriculum a couple of days in a row and then haven&#39;t touched it<br/>\nfor weeks and then one of the kids says &#39;lets do some math&#39; and we get the<br/>\nbooks out and read and &#39;do math&#39;.  The funny thing is that they always seem<br/>\nto remember the concepts and how to do whatever we learned the last time<br/>\nand pick up where we left off.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend who is a teacher in public schools insists that my children can&#39;t<br/>\nactually be remembering the concepts and operations weeks later.  I<br/>\nexplained that they remember because they have actually learned because we<br/>\nstudy the stuff as long as they want and discuss and pull apart each<br/>\nconcept until we are satisfied that we know as much as we want to know<br/>\nbefore we move on (I say &#39;we&#39; because I really am learning this stuff all<br/>\nover again).  I used the term &quot;Socratic method&quot; to try to explain what we<br/>\ndo when we &#39;do math&#39;.  She insisted that the Socratic method could only<br/>\napply to philosophy.... I smiled and told her that we must do something<br/>\ndifferent then and we all were happy with our learning, so it really didn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter what it was called.  I didn&#39;t even bother to tell her that we only<br/>\ndid a few of the problems from each unit, if we do any for a particular<br/>\nlesson from the books that we use.  I didn&#39;t want to shake her view of<br/>\nreality too badly, mostly because I no longer have a desire to prove that I<br/>\nam providing my children with a good education and because she didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nready to hear that there are other options out there.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Dec 19, 2011 at 10:28 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This page might be a good one to save for any parent experiencing anger or<br/>\n&gt; fear or frustration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/being/healing\">http://sandradodd.com/being/healing</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today the Just Add Light and Stir post links to the &quot;being&quot; page, but the<br/>\n&gt; link above isn&#39;t there.
