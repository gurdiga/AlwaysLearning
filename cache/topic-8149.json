I don&#39;t remember how old she <br/>\nis.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she have her own room and her own separate stuff?  My thought about the <br/>\nbracelet (which certainly could be wrong) is based on some factors in my own <br/>\nchildhood with a very, very difficult cousin who lived with us.  Because she <br/>\nfelt nothing was really hers in the world, and that other people had things <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t, she was destructive.  And sometimes in that same way, getting <br/>\nothers to sabotage or destroy their own happiness so that she&#39;s not the one <br/>\nwho took the action (as she saw it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt sorry for her then and I do now, but I don&#39;t believe that to this day <br/>\nshe has anything of value, physical or sentimental.  She defined herself as a <br/>\nperson who didn&#39;t have enough, and made that come true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Ashley is jealous, that&#39;s a neediness.  If she resents her brother is it <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s crowded physically?  Is she having to share things with him she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to share?  That seems too simplistic in a way, but maybe it&#39;s a <br/>\nbasic.  Sharing isn&#39;t necessary to the toothbrush-and-air level.  To what <br/>\nlevel IS it necessary?  Different families have different levels of <br/>\ncloseness, whether imposed or voluntary or necessity.   Can she be given more <br/>\nspace?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that surprised me and changed my whole perspective on <br/>\nfamily life was the idea of a child being greatly mismatched with parents.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re fortunate that each of our children is recognizeably like one of us, or <br/>\nin the case of Holly, has traits we recognize from both of us or other <br/>\nrelatives.  But what I read and heard people talk about a dozen years ago or <br/>\nso (maybe someone here knows of books or a website) was about what happens if <br/>\ntwo quiet parents have a very talkative child?  What if two outgoing, <br/>\ntalkative parents have an introverted and quiet-seeking child?  Sometimes the <br/>\nparents try to change the child to the point of psychotherapy and drugs to <br/>\nmake him &quot;right.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese ideas are being thrown out kind of as stabs in the dark.  Maybe they&#39;re <br/>\ntotal misses.    But if you have a child who DOES have space, privacy, <br/>\npossessions and isn&#39;t jealous of friends and neighbors (not always something <br/>\na family can engineer, I know) is it possibly that she&#39;s a mismatch for the <br/>\nfamily?  And if so, is it possible you could find another adult or teen, <br/>\nmaybe who is a better match who could do things with her sometimes, let her <br/>\nhang out with their family, give her some more focussed one-on-one time, a <br/>\nplace to vent, talk, be different?   Not for life, just maybe a year or <br/>\nseveral years until she gets some more control of her impulses and some <br/>\nbetter understanding of what she can do to make herself and others around her <br/>\nmore comfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if the modelling and persuasion of the family isn&#39;t affecting her, <br/>\nmaybe someone else&#39;s method or description or view will make sense to her, <br/>\nand you could appeal to that other person to try to give her what she&#39;s not <br/>\ngetting, or explain in a whole different way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might cost money.  You might have to &quot;hire a babysitter&quot; in a way, but it <br/>\nmight be well worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if none of that makes a lick of sense in the current situation, let it <br/>\npass on by.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117956499,"authorName":"maryfhickman@jps.net","from":"&lt;maryfhickman@...&gt;","profile":"mfhickman95616","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Family life","postDate":"1027957508","msgId":8149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNwcmluZ21haWwuMDk5NC4xMDI3OTU3NTA4LjAuMjMxNzAxMDBAd2VibWFpbC5wYXMuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8168,"prevInTime":8148,"nextInTime":8150,"topicId":8149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Everyone, Tim finally found a solution to our computer troubles, now I won t send any\nmore messages 3 times.

Sorry about that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n We stayed home this weekend without an agenda. The kids watched cartoons for<br/>\nhours, then played games and folded origami. We swam in our vinyl pool, and at<br/>\nthe city pools. I read Ashley the last half of Little Princess. We let the<br/>\nkittens out to explore the yard. Tim mowed and watered.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n Tim and I are amazed that in our family, the three kids can not manage to<br/>\ncope with each other for more than 2 minutes. You all have heard about us<br/>\nbefore. My oldest pesters her brother and he responds physically. Both older<br/>\nkids do great with their sister, who is 2.5. So, even though we were home<br/>\nwithout a rush just by ourselves, we had tension that gets very tiring as my 2<br/>\nkids work out their relationship.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAshley continues to whine cry at the slightest suggestions from mom and dad.<br/>\nShe just does not seem to enjoy life with her family, which depresses us.<br/>\nShe&#39;s bright, energetic, creative, nurturing to others. We wonder is she<br/>\ntired? Over stimulated? Bored? If life does not go as Ashley has planned, she<br/>\nfights and cries and whines so no one else can enjoy themselves. She had a<br/>\nsleepover this week and threw a tantrum because she talked her friend into<br/>\ndoing something that made her friend sad. As I spoke with her about force and<br/>\ncoersion, she blew up into tears and her sad feelings overshadowed the fact<br/>\nthat her friend said no and Ashley talked her into taking apart a bracelet<br/>\nthat is very difficult to put back together. All this at 6 am. Ashley scream<br/>\ncried for 15 minutes. I walked Kelly home, she needed her mom now. Kelly is<br/>\nquiet and lets Ashley trample all over her.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n We&#39;ve managed play dates and outings and all kinds of Ashley focus for years<br/>\nnow and still, she does not seem to have much fun here. I&#39;m looking at her<br/>\nadult self in the future. She has many great traits. She is determined, she<br/>\nknows her position, she creates elabotate plans and follows through with them.<br/>\nShe is passionate about her ideas. How then do we go about helping her be more<br/>\npolite, respectful of others feelings? Had she heard Kelly say, no Ashley I do<br/>\nnot want to take my bracelet apart and repected that no, the resulting sadness<br/>\nwould not have followed. We respect her words. We model respect constantly.<br/>\nShe seems deaf to our words.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWow, I guess I needed to vent again about my daughter who throws us new<br/>\nconfounding pitches each week. Tim bought us a new car while I was away with 2<br/>\nother HS moms and kids for camping, wow I&#39;m in the mini van club now. We will<br/>\ncontinue to learn Beattles songs this week for a Friday night show. Tim is<br/>\nlooking forward to bringing his brother, 37 with Downs Syndrom, up for a<br/>\nvisit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8178,"nextTopicId":8188}}
