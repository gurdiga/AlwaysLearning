I would ask her if she wants to know her scores, and  <br/>\nthen act accordingly. Practicing for those tests is generally very  <br/>\nhelpful. In our case, my daughter  - who took the PSAT and the SAT -  <br/>\nmostly studied for the math part because the word stuff comes  <br/>\nnaturally to her. She still scored very high on the verbal part and  <br/>\nmedium low on the math.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to remember how little these scores mean in  <br/>\nand of themselves and to view them as unpleasant obstacles to getting  <br/>\nwhere you want to go.

I figured at least <br/>\nshe&#39;d experience taking a standardized state test.  Her scores came back very low.
