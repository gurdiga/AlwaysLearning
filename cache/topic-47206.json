I have 4 kids, 9, 6, 3 and 15 months.  After having my fourth and last baby I am finding it VERY DIFFICULT to school my kids at all.  Just when I get started the baby wakes up, or he and my 3 year old get into all the teaching materials that we are using for our lesson. My kids seem to learn better in the morning which is fine but I am a night person so trying to get up and functioning early is hard. I know there are many families with various age kids but how do you do it?  I am really finding myself being more stressed every time I try to do a lesson because I am struggling with the littler ones. I give the 3 year old her stuff, which is hard because she cant read yet.  Then I am running back and forth answering questions for the 6 and 9 year old all while trying to keep the baby out of EVERYTHING!!!   PLEASE HELP!!!!  Plus it doesn&#39;t help that my mom and husband are on my case because I am not &quot;teaching&quot; my kids.
