It seems that I started doing that after I saw that<br/>\nis how other people do it. I think I should take the first place position <br/>\nback,<br/>\nsince I am the one who signs the damm things anyhow!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And my checkbook has only one name, MINE!! hehe&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to look at my personal acct. My name is second...but at the teachers<br/>\ncredit union acct (got signed up thru my mom, who was signed up thru her<br/>\ndad, who was signed up thru his son who is a private school principal) my<br/>\nname is primary on the account. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My return address labels say Ren Allen&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI have addy labels that have just my name on them and some that say Mr & Mrs.<br/>\n<br/>\n,&lt;&lt;my debit card  my own&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI just opened a new credit card acct with my name only.  We don&#39;t use them<br/>\nbut I found it helpful when renting a car (almost impossible to rent a car w/o<br/>\na cc)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother side note, when we got married I didn&#39;t change my name. I had better<br/>\ncredit than dh and didn&#39;t want to mess that up. I also had a confidential <br/>\nmarriage<br/>\nlicense, so I didn&#39;t even have to say I was married to him and they couldn&#39;t<br/>\nprove it by any records, thus my credit stayed mine.  Well after many years I<br/>\nthink that would be harder to prove. I have given all my children their <br/>\nfathers last<br/>\nname, on our corporation my accountant used my married name as my last<br/>\nname (so I can&#39;t notarize anything because my legal name is still my maiden<br/>\nname). Anyhow, since our names and lives are so intertwined I have finally <br/>\ndecided to hyphenate my name.  That way I can sign either or legally and not<br/>\nhave to change so much of what I have in my name currently!  Funny dh doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncare if I change my name at all, but I sort of feel left out since I am the <br/>\nonly one<br/>\nwith a different name (although I introduce myself using my married name and<br/>\nmy family does also). Heck even the bank lets me cash checks with my married<br/>\nname which is not on any ID including my drivers license.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; and same for him. I guess we both crave independence even with the <br/>\n financial thing.<br/>\n Even though we share the decisions about the money, we like having our own <br/>\n accounts.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI handle all the money and I like it that way. Good thing dh hates to deal <br/>\nwith<br/>\nthat and I don&#39;t. Its a nice equal distribution in our family.  He makes it <br/>\nbut<br/>\nI manage it.  Actually we both take a salary from our business which direct<br/>\ndeposits into our personal acct.  And I can make my salary more than his<br/>\nif I want to.....; )  And all the bonuses and draws are made out in my name<br/>\nsince I do all the banking &lt;G&gt;.  Besides I need to pay more taxes than he<br/>\ndoes right now to qualify for disability.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Just a homemaker","postDate":"1039883873","msgId":11333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0ZC4xOGQyZDRmMC4yYjJjYjg2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11332,"nextInTopic":11336,"prevInTime":11332,"nextInTime":11334,"topicId":11332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/14/2002 10:14:05 AM Central Standard Time, ...
