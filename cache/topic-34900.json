Change is hard.  There are still people that go &quot;ballistic&quot; over<br/>\nthe idea of elementary age students using $10 handheld solar powered<br/>\ncalculators instead of spending days/hours/weeks and a ream of paper to<br/>\npractice long division or calculate compound interest.<br/>\nOr who think it reasonable to forbid older students to possess graphing<br/>\ncalculators or to use keyboards to write essays that are actually legible!<br/>\n<br/>\nKMN may be a reasonable demand for a tutor who cannot accept change.  It<br/>\nwould be reasonable to expect persons to navigate between languages and to<br/>\nbe able to use one singularly on a particular task but the impression I got<br/>\nfrom the essay indicated more absolute value judgment of the language rather<br/>\nthan merely an expectation of separation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe,  I admit that I am too set in my ways to learn another language and<br/>\n&quot;foreign&quot; languages never came easy for me anyway.   Would you believe I<br/>\nstill use a checkbook &quot;register&quot;  and balance my account by hand?  And it is<br/>\ndoubtful I will EVER text message in my sleep...especially since I tend to<br/>\nuse standard English even in texts....which I only started appreciating 6<br/>\nmonths ago when it was the means of communication when son was in birthing<br/>\nroom with wife and us grandmas were looking after the toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in awe of the many I know who can text (rapidly!!!)  with phone in<br/>\ntheir pocket.  I count it along the same  road as the years I spent looking<br/>\nfor a teenager each time daylight savings time rotated and I had a digital<br/>\nwatch to reset.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, May 15, 2008 at 1:45 PM, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-kolesnikova13-2008may13,0,74953.story\">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-kolesnikova13-2008may13,0,74953.story</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The author seems very angry at the kids.
