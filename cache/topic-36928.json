It was easy.  I took all the &quot;normal&quot; subjects--history, math, english, music, pe, etc.  And then I gave her a grade (As in everything).  Then I discriped what Alexx did in each subject.  &quot;Alexx has been volunteering at Rancho Los Ceritos, the local historic center, as a docent and also cataloging historical artifacts, after having completed their teen docent training program.&quot;  Alexx has been focused on real life math that she encounters daily in her life such as percentages, basic geometry, etc.&quot;  &quot;Alexx is currently reading blah blah blah.&quot;  The college thought it was great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about the math.  Alexx doesn&#39;t really do math on paper, never has, it&#39;s always been real life math.  She did have to take the math placement exam today, at her CC, we&#39;ll see how she did.  She wants to sit down and do written math this next year with me, so she can be prepared to do college level math.  I&#39;m not at all worried about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n---- elwazani &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elwazani@...\">elwazani@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have read on this in various places, but was wondering if any of you<br/>\n&gt; have experience with this...also, have any of you had older kids going<br/>\n&gt; into high school classes or college classes having only experienced math<br/>\n&gt; in the living enviroment versus having &quot;done&quot; math...Beverly<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159184374,"authorName":"elwazani","from":"&quot;elwazani&quot; &lt;elwazani@...&gt;","profile":"elwazani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"turnig unschooling into a transcript!?","postDate":"1217556187","msgId":36928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2dHFzcit2NzJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36929,"prevInTime":36927,"nextInTime":36929,"topicId":36928,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have read on this in various places, but was wondering if any of you have experience with this...also, have any of you had older kids going into high school","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-258913777\">I have read on this in various places, but was wondering if any of you<br/>\nhave experience with this...also, have any of you had older kids going<br/>\ninto high school classes or college classes having only experienced math<br/>\nin the living enviroment versus having &quot;done&quot; math...Beverly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36866,"nextTopicId":36927}}
