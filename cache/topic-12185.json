When I<br/>\ncame to Germany, everything sounded so expensive because it was deutsch<br/>\nmarks and the exchange rate was 2:1.

Couldn&#39;t you just tell<br/>\npeople that you have them available and they can get them from you if they<br/>\nwant one?  Carry a little bag of them around to meals and stuff, or give<br/>\npeople your room number?
