I<br/>\nalways think it&#39;s nice to see stories about adult homeschoolers as it gives<br/>\nme additional courage to really know that what our family is doing &quot;works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister is now 22 and we pulled her and her twin brother out of public<br/>\nschool at age 13. They pretty much deschooled and then unschooled after<br/>\nthat and both have associate degrees but have taken interesting paths. Tim<br/>\nspent a year Euro-railing around Europe and then followed his childhood<br/>\ninterest by spending another year in Paris at the Cordon Bleu cooking<br/>\nschool. He is now doing an internship on a cruiseship that travels around<br/>\nthe world. He&#39;s just been promoted to assistant chef which is good. He<br/>\nLOVES what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my sister Joanna is currently visiting us in Abu Dhabi after teaching<br/>\nfor the last few months in Africa. While in Kenya, teaching near Lake<br/>\nNikuru, she met some people who travel every weekend to work in a Sudanese<br/>\nrefugee camp in Uganda. They gradually shared with her all about the<br/>\nhistory and culture of Sudan and she has amazed us all with her knowledge<br/>\nand desire to know more.<br/>\nAnyway she visited the camp and has now been offered a teaching position<br/>\nthere. So when she leaves us in 6 weeks she is heading back to Kenya and<br/>\nthen on to Uganda (a 14 hour bus ride across very bumpy terrain).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 8 American volunteers live in an armed encampment an hour away from the<br/>\ncamp with running water and electricity. The British volunteers live in<br/>\ngrass-roofed clay houses in the camp and haul water from the well -- they<br/>\ngo to bed when it&#39;s dark as there is no electricity. Jo has opted to stay<br/>\nwith the Brits as she believes it is wrong to live differently than the<br/>\npeople you are trying to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe took loads of photos and is now trying to find friends of hers back in<br/>\nthe US to sponsor some kids of a new friend of hers who is dying of AIDS.<br/>\nThe father died last year and the mother is almost dead and cannot afford<br/>\nmedication. The grandparents will love and care for the two children (4 and<br/>\n5 and no HIV) but have no money for school fees. <br/>\n<br/>\nJo also wants to go back and help an old woman she met in the refugee camp.<br/>\nThe woman is very sick and elderly and gets very little care. When Jo met<br/>\nher it had rained for a few days and since you can see daylight in the<br/>\nholes in her straw roof tiny house, she was living in deep mud. The aid<br/>\nworkers try and help but they have 15,000 people to care for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she showed me the pictures, Jo cried for these people and vowed to share<br/>\ntheir stories. Her goal is to educate people about the plight of the<br/>\nSudanese who have been at war for many years and are often forgotten.<br/>\nShe has also decided that when she goes back to the US she would like to<br/>\nfinish her BS in archaeology partly because of her desire to try and go and<br/>\nstudy caves in Sudan that have ancient but nonstudied drawings and relics<br/>\nin them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile she is here in Abu Dhabi she is going to volunteer at the UNICEF<br/>\noffice so she can get experience in the fund-raising side of aid<br/>\norganizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow I thought I&#39;d update you guys on her continuing education so far.<br/>\nPretty good for a kid who spent her first two years hs&#39;ing (she didn&#39;t gain<br/>\nfreedom until age 13) watching television and whining about mom not buying<br/>\nher enough &quot;stuff.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nKate -- a braggy sister:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5922,"nextTopicId":5868}}
