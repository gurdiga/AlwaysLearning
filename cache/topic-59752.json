On board  <br/>\nthe ships had what they called holodecks where you could physically  <br/>\nenter, move around and interact with a virtual world.

He knows he&#39;s not hurting anything.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s pointing at bits of light on the screen and causing reactions.  <br/>\n*He* knows this.

The latter has me in need of reading some threads about young kids playing war games of this kind.  I don&#39;t even know exactly what my questions are in this arena, so if anyone can find a thread they can point me to that it would be great.  It has something to do with &quot;Is he too young for what he is playing?&quot; (meaning the call of duty one.)  He doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered by anything he is playing and he really wanted to get the game because he has some new on-line friends who play it.  They are ages 8-12 I believe. SOme older I&#39;m sure. (But I&#39;m feeling like age has nothing to do with this-necessarily.  That feels like a rule and not a principle.)   I keep thinking of the box that says &quot;M17+&quot;  It&#39;s bugging me.   Seems like he would walk away if it was too much, no?  ALso, I keep thinking that what he gets and what I get are different.  I just need to read a little more.  Maybe flesh this out for myself.  I can feel the desire to make the game go away but I can see it comes from all things fear related.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really want is to find what the fear is, get that to go away and keep the game because it&#39;s what Oliver likes.  I think he likes the game more than his Mom&#39;s fear.  Just a guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a couple of months ago he said after playing Halo Reach, &quot;I wish this were real!&quot;  I asked him what he meant.  He repeated, I wish this were real!  Duh Mom.  I could use some more ideas on what he might be experiencing that is so terrific.  I personally don&#39;t feel joyful gaming and never have but Oliver clearly does which is terrific.  So what does he wish were real?  Which aspect?  What does he want to &quot;do&quot; in real life?  It&#39;s thrown me for a loop and I suspect some of my own fear comes from this.  Does he want to slaughter aliens or enemy soldiers?  Or is he saying he wants to be this powerful and successful in real life? Or something else?   <br/>\n<br/>\nCary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59753,"nextTopicId":59666}}
