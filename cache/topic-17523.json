We are going through this same thing with my 14yodd.  She was hs&#39;ed for two years then wanted to try ps again.  Well, the grass was NOT greener on the other side so we&#39;ve all (us and her) have decided that she needs to come back home.  She had poor grades in two of her classes although all of her teachers said she was an A/B student.  It was not poor grades, it was poor teachers or poor relationships with the teacher.  Anyhoo,  I have been reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s (sp?) book The Teenager Liberation Handbook.  A must read for hs&#39;ers with an unschool bent.  What I am doing with  my dd is basically handing her education over to her.  I told her I will help her, guide her, whatever but that her education at this point was basically up to her.  She also came home feeling like a failure.  In ps in prior years she had always been an A/B student and so getting C&#39;s and D&#39;s have not sat well with her.  The biggest problem I see for her is she<br/>\n thought high school was a waste of time.    <br/>\nMy suggestion would be to sit down with her and discuss her goals.  My dd wants to be a veterinarian (has for years) so her goals are pretty well defined.  But outline her goals (as they are now, they could change) and the different ways to attain those goals.  My dd has become excited about her education again.<br/>\nI hope this helps.  Other than that, you have my sympathies.  I understand completely.  Having a teenager is a roller coaster ride.  Throw female into the mix and it can get wild sometimes.  Those darn hormones are all over the map (hers and mine ���)<br/>\nGood luck with you and dd&#39;s adventures.<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!
