CA) with our four children.<br/>\nMorgan is 16, Seth is 8.5, Sara is 6.5 and Jake is 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling fits in well with our philosophy of parenting joyfully  <br/>\nand mindfully without punishments or rewards of any kind.  I&#39;m a  <br/>\nformer preschool teacher (interned at Play Mountain Place in LA in  <br/>\n1991 which started me on the path of respectful parenting and  <br/>\nunschooling), I&#39;m a student postpartum doula (through DONA) and a  <br/>\nparent educator (I co-facilitate a class called Connected Parenting  <br/>\nwith an amazing and dear mama friend).  My oldest son attended  <br/>\nSummerhill School briefly when he was 10, and we&#39;ve dabbled in a  <br/>\ncouple of free schools throughout the years, in the name of seeking  <br/>\nmore community.  I greatly enjoy unschooling myself, and of course I  <br/>\nkeep finding new things to learn, new projects to try, and new ideas  <br/>\nto think about.  Our family practices &quot;natural family living&quot; in that  <br/>\nour kids were born at home, we practice ecological breastfeeding,  <br/>\nbabywearing, co-sleeping, etc. and we have been inspired by The  <br/>\nContinuum Concept.  We attended LIFE is Good last April in Corvallis,  <br/>\nOR and had reservations for Live and Learn but didn&#39;t make it (we&#39;ll  <br/>\nuse those plane tickets this year though!), and are looking forward  <br/>\nto meeting some of you in person at LIFE is Good in May...<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;sleep is for the weak&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33173,"nextTopicId":33520}}
