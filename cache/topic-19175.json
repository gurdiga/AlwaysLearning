I know there is a mom here who also <br/>\nlost a husband recently ---about a year ago?---with two small children, a boy <br/>\nand a girl. I&#39;m SO sorry I can&#39;t remember your name or e-mail. But I thought <br/>\nI&#39;d post her plea here. I also suggested that she come here.

Basically, I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling pretty miserable, and it&#39;s only natural-but it&#39;s not just my dh&#39;s <br/>\ndeath that is wearing on me. It&#39;s the fact that my family&#39;s way of life is being <br/>\nthreatened. Family-they love me-but they have no faith in me whatsoever it <br/>\nseems like. Only if I say that dh and I had made such and such decision before he <br/>\ndied is my opinion respected. I&#39;m really starting to get pissed off about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you will all be pleased and maybe even proud to know I&#39;m standing <br/>\nfirm on the unschooling/homeschooling choice we made years ago. I gave my parents <br/>\na piece of my mind when they began to push too hard. There are other family <br/>\nmembers who are watching closely and speculating openly. I wish they&#39;d shut the <br/>\nhell up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know single parents homeschool, I just don&#39;t know any who do. Are you out <br/>\nthere? This a new path I&#39;m treading, a new role-widow, single, career mom and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to lose that old, comfy role of homeschooler. References, <br/>\nresources, anecdotes, opinions...all are welcome. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19170,"nextTopicId":19178}}
