Some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-172353764\">Kelly,<br/>\nI think you&#39;ll be extremely pleased with Dee&#39;s<br/>\nFunShop--whatever it is---because she was terrific at<br/>\nbalancing the needs of the different families. Some<br/>\nwanted her to be &quot;scientific&quot; and all that.  Others<br/>\nwanted her to be laidback and fun.  She did a great<br/>\njob satisfying everyone which would have been an<br/>\nimpossible task for moi.  Sometimes we homeschoolers<br/>\ncan be quite demanding! ; )  She had great freebies<br/>\ntoo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend and I were later chatting about the workshop<br/>\nDee did and decided that it was a godsend having<br/>\nsomeone come and do something that was high interest,<br/>\ngood quality, and yet understands our kids.  Sometimes<br/>\nwe have brought people in or have gone somewhere and<br/>\nyou can tell they are thinking our kids are<br/>\nmaladjusted because they don&#39;t go to school.  Ever<br/>\nhave that? The presenter asks a question and usually<br/>\nit is worded in a weird way and the kids don&#39;t say<br/>\nanything and you can tell he&#39;s thinking &quot;These kids<br/>\nneed to be in school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDee mentioned that she homeschools her kids so I think<br/>\nthat makes a huge difference.  Her kids were very<br/>\npoised and knowlegeable which I thought showed good<br/>\nrole modeling for my kids.  That kids could learn<br/>\nsomething and then go out and talk about it in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nDee let our kids hold the gators and snakes.  She was<br/>\nreal casual about it.  She brought small stuff so<br/>\nnothing was intimidating. I even held something!  She<br/>\nasked that parents not force kids to hold anything<br/>\nthey were uncomfortable with though.  One mom, who<br/>\nisn&#39;t a member of our group but was invited by another<br/>\nmember, got a snake and gave it to her 6 year old son.<br/>\n I can&#39;t explain it but the mom was kinda arrogant and<br/>\nacted like she knew it all.  Like it was her son&#39;s<br/>\nright to hold and do whatever with the snake.  The kid<br/>\nwas holding the snake and it was wrapped on his wrist.<br/>\n It was a really small snake.  The kid then decides he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want the snake and flings it across the room. <br/>\nDee didn&#39;t freak. She calmly went and got the snake<br/>\nand went right on answering the kids questions as if<br/>\nnothing had happened.  The mom didn&#39;t apologize and<br/>\nthought it was funny!!  Some of us were burning with<br/>\nembarrassment.  But Dee never mentioned it and said<br/>\nshe had a great time and that we  had great kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another guy in her lab who goes around too.<br/>\nWe saw them at a community event last year. He brings<br/>\na retired (woman) school teacher with him as an<br/>\nassistant. You DON&#39;T want them if Dee can&#39;t make it.  <br/>\nThe retired teacher was VERY ARROGANT.  The guy gave<br/>\nan ok talk. He was kinda charismatic in his own way<br/>\nbecause he is a tall blond, good speaking voice, but<br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t into kids. That was evident. He kept them<br/>\nall at an arm&#39;s distance. When his time was up, they<br/>\npacked up and left.  They weren&#39;t into hanging around<br/>\nand talking to every kid like Dee.  I think the guy<br/>\nand teacher both had an attitude about homeschoolers<br/>\nIMHO.  Dee is petite and I think especially the young<br/>\nkids warm up to her very easily.  The guy is over 6 ft<br/>\ntall and the young kids were afraid of him. The<br/>\nassistant had an attitude, even more than the guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a question about FunShops so I can tell my<br/>\nfriends more details.  Are they just for kids?  I mean<br/>\nare the workshop leaders going to expect just kids<br/>\n(and sometimes parents)?  Are kids going to be allowed<br/>\nto come and go? Just wondering because if I left my<br/>\nkids in a FunShop so I could go to a workshop or talk,<br/>\nthen I would want to know that they stayed there until<br/>\nI got back.  How will that work?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is mommyitis but I couldn&#39;t figure out WHEN<br/>\nthe Funshops were scheduled.<br/>\n <br/>\nRachel Minninger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
