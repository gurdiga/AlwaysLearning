And many of us are still in those<br/>\nenvironments, at least work.  The things often said there tend to stay<br/>\nwith us because the ideas are repeated so much that they seem true.  I<br/>\nlove John Holt&#39;s metaphor about why teaching doesn&#39;t work: that our<br/>\nattempt to teach is separated from realtiy; that by training a parrot<br/>\nto say something often enough, apart from the experience of the words&#39;<br/>\nmeanings, we believe the parrot will come to understand the phrases<br/>\nthey learn to speak, simply by repeating.  (I&#39;m paraphrasing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s great that I got the chance to take in new knowledge by watching<br/>\nKarl as he showed us how he trusts himself and we can too.  Most<br/>\npeople haven&#39;t had that experience, and if faced with the knowledge,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t understand because it&#39;s not what they&#39;re interested in and<br/>\nthey have no reason in their own thinking for such understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarl and I lived with my in laws for a few months, and it was strange<br/>\nlooking through the lens of unschooling at a familiar scene where<br/>\npeople are seeking order through a series of predictable actions.  And<br/>\nnoticing that the order wasn&#39;t predictable because of certain touted<br/>\nactions so much as through force and coercion.  I felt an odd sense of<br/>\nreality there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] A thought","postDate":"1238609747","msgId":43633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDRUI4ODI3LTJFQzItNEQxNC05QUZELTQxQkMxN0JBMzgzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwOTgxNS40MjM5Ni5xbUB3ZWIzMzEwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDcwOTgxNS40MjM5Ni5xbUB3ZWIzMzEwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43628,"nextInTopic":43635,"prevInTime":43632,"nextInTime":43634,"topicId":43628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- It seems to me that these fears of doing nothing but tv watching or only eating junk come from our oun issues.
