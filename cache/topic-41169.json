I use them, for lack of anything better.  <br/>\nUnschooling sounds like it&#39;s all about what we *don&#39;t* do, which is <br/>\nexactly what everyone thinks- that we *don&#39;t do.* I&#39;d like to find <br/>\nsomething more positive that speaks to what we *do.* Radical is <br/>\nloaded.  Obviously, in this society, what we are doing is radical.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s way off the beaten path.  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really that <br/>\nradical in the context of the whole world and other cultures.  It <br/>\nfeels quite natural, and it&#39;s not because people were suddenly <br/>\nenlightened in the 1980&#39;s.  It&#39;s because a small part of our culture <br/>\nrecently rediscovered some ancient truths about human learning that <br/>\nother cultures have known this whole time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I&#39;m having in my search for a new term is that the other <br/>\nterms I listed seem to have more of a relaxed homeschooler <br/>\nconnotation than a radical unschooler connotation.  So, no <br/>\ncurriculum, but still chores kind of thinking behind them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41183,"nextTopicId":41229}}
