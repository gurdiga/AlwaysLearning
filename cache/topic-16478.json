Actually, most people walking around are little kids<br/>\nacting as if they are adults.  The only way I&#39;ve found to remain at peace in<br/>\nthe midst of such &quot;sleeping&quot; people is to adopt the same attitude with them<br/>\nthat I do with my children.  I strive to offer them the full welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;welcoming response&quot; is the one most people give their children when<br/>\nthey are learning to walk and talk:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    FULL ENCOURAGEMENT<br/>\n&gt;    MUTUAL ENJOYMENT<br/>\n&gt;    NO MISTAKES - Falling down is part of the process<br/>\n&gt;    NO JUDGMENT - As they learn to walk we don&#39;t say, &quot;You walk funny&quot; or<br/>\nlabel them as &quot;clumsy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    INNER MOTIVATION - They want to learn.  They have a strong innate<br/>\ndesire to grow in skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    WE ARE NOT DELIBERATELY TEACHING THEM - They learn from our model.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    WE TAKE CUES FROM THE CHILD - We don&#39;t try to force them to walk before<br/>\nthey are ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    NO EXTERNAL REWARDS ARE NECESSARY - Learning and accomplishing are<br/>\ntheir own reward.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    SUPPORT AND COMFORT ARE READILY AVAILABLE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    FULL EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS - Barring disability, we have no doubt that<br/>\nthey will learn to walk and talk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    BELIEF THAT CHILDREN ARE SELF CORRECTING - If a child says a word<br/>\nincorrectly, we have no doubt that they will eventually learn the correct<br/>\nwork.  We even enjoy the mispronouncing and think it is cute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dd&#39;s creations have lived on: &quot;floaty delvation&quot; (flotation device),<br/>\n&quot;kitty chasm&quot; (catechism).  Don&#39;t you all remember your children&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this welcoming is quite irresistible.  I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s<br/>\nwhat everyone is looking for in life.  Almost everyone loses their full<br/>\nwelcome before age 5, half at toilet training &quot;time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But what it is, it&#39;s an open heart that trusts life.  Anyone who unschools<br/>\nalready does this, we just need to extend it to all those &quot;grown ups&quot; in<br/>\ndisguise.  Since I began doing that, I&#39;ve witnessed really hard core people<br/>\nchange before my eyes.  For instance, my mom, the know-it-all kill-joy of<br/>\nthe 20th century, starting saying really tender things to me like, &quot;I really<br/>\nlike the way you look at me&quot; because I was radiating the tenderness that I<br/>\nalways wanted from her.  It&#39;s also what she always wanted.  Neither of us<br/>\nexperienced it as long as I was trying to get it from her.  Once I<br/>\ndiscovered my own capacity to give it under any circumstances, she began to<br/>\nreflect it back to me.  I&#39;m so happy - she&#39;s 83 and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll<br/>\nmake it another year.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trying to convince anyone of anything is usually futile, because it&#39;s a<br/>\nnatural law of physics that any force creates its own counterforce.  But an<br/>\nopen, tender invitation is irresistable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fondly,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Retta<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; The New Yahoo!
