He was failing school due to Dyslexia/Dysgraphia/Dyscalculia.  Every year from first grade through mid third grade all we heard was how smart he was and yet because he could not read and write he needed to repeat that grade - which we refused until we were told that because he could not pass the state test in third grade he would be retained anyway.  The school told us they had no idea how to help someone that was considered &quot;gifted&quot; with an &quot;LD&quot;. To be honest all they ever focused on was the LD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never homeschooled school at home, we unschooled all along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to age 17.5   It&#39;s been exactly 9 years as we pulled him out of school over Christmas break.  Anyway, he commented last fall that he thinks his reading is just fine now.  He decided to start community college this coming semester.  For the entrance test he scored extremely high in English and reading.  My point is, given the freedom to develop and progress on his own with very supportive/involved parents he is now considered a high reader not only by himself but college as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in the beginning was pretty much Lego&#39;s Lego&#39;s Lego&#39;s and lots of TV/movies/film as well as activities outside the home.  He began gaming at around age 10.  He&#39;d sit and play at the desk and we had a recliner near by where I&#39;d sit and read books or use the lap top - close enough to immediately read or spell for him when he requested help. Then came game guides.  Anime led to Manga. Sandwiched in amongst this was more Lego&#39;s ;)  books with lots of pictures and captions under those pictures, movies and films that interested him, going places of interest, YouTube, Googling for more info, board games, Magic The Gathering card gaming, etc.  - providing lots of various experiences in things he was interested in.  For example a trip to the Art museum would not have captured his interest in and of itself, but a trip there in conjunction with their Chinese New Year celebration activities did.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: How to begin?","postDate":"1325527933","msgId":64691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1Nzk5OTFGLUVFQTMtNEIyQS04RkE5LTcxMUZBOUMzRjYyQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkc3IyZytrNjVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkc3IyZytrNjVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64688,"nextInTopic":64695,"prevInTime":64690,"nextInTime":64692,"topicId":64684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-People with dyslexia don t have any more difficulty learning to read than people without,-=- I don t think that s true, but I think teaching might hurt them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-926081842\">-=-People with dyslexia don&#39;t have any more difficulty learning to read than people without,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, but I think teaching might hurt them more than it would hurt other people. :-)<br/>\nThey need to figure it out their own way, and until they get old enough and experienced enough--until they&#39;ve figured out their own way to know left from right and settle on a direction--it won&#39;t be easy for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching (by ANY method) will not help with any of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-When teaching reading is hard, then there&#39;s almost invariably a mismatch between the teaching method and the learner. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen learning reading from someone who is trying to teach it works, that&#39;s probably largely coincidence.<br/>\nI&#39;d rather not have people on this list recommending ANY sort of &quot;teaching reading,&quot; no matter how matched the method and learner.

People often like routines, predictability, security. If you&#39;re going through a divorce, your kids have just lost a chunk of two of those. If you&#39;ve changed your personal schedule from something regular to something looser, they&#39;ve lost their routines, too. That&#39;s not to say they need alarms and lessons and timetables, but they may benefit from things like regular meals, or plans for the week - groceries on thursday and laundry on friday sorts of things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;my younger kiddos ages 8,6,4,3 and 2 are like wild little monkeys. Destructive monkeys.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nThey need more of your time and energy and attention. If putting those into a schedule helps You do that, then do it - give them the reassurance you&#39;re there for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nOrganizing and planning projects is a good idea as long as your flexible enough to go with the flow a bit. If half the kids still run off and break something while you&#39;re having a nice craft with the rest, that&#39;s not helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo your kids Like crafty things? Maybe some of them need more active things - like rope climbing or building a fort. Be sure you&#39;re looking for activities which will spark your kids&#39; interests, not just things which seem educational. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.

Sometimes that mismatch is a result of readiness - some kids aren&#39;t ready to read until the early teens! Just as often it&#39;s a result of offering a decoding strategy which doesn&#39;t work for that particular person. You likely got a lot of bad information about teaching reading and blundered along, not knowing you were making the whole process much harder than it needed to be - bummer! But it may help you to know that it&#39;s not the dyslexia itself which is the problem. People with dyslexia don&#39;t have any more difficulty learning to read than people without, and have the same range for natural learning - anywhere from 4 to 14 is pretty normal for beginning to read naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He HAD to learn sign language and how to communicate so he could learn.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;ve learned sign language as well! I know many times parents are advised not to, with hearing impaired kids, but the most common complaint of deaf and hard of hearing adults is their parents wouldn&#39;t learn to sign and it feels like a kind of rejection. So yes, learning sign is an important skill for your son and anyone close to him. People Want to communicate. It won&#39;t even hurt if you have a kind of family language or dialect - deaf people often end up learning multiple forms of sign, anyways, in addition to needing to learn a whole &#39;nother language for reading and writing. The important thing is for your child to feel capable and connected. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you worried about him reading? Get more video games ;) Put captions on the tv. Back off pushing any kind of teaching reading and focus on helping him communicate in ways which work for him. Become his best ally. Eventually, he&#39;ll see reading as a useful skill to acquire. One of the advantages of unschooling is there&#39;s no timetable for when something Has To be learned and reading, frankly, is learned easier later. The push to get kids reading early has to do with the needs of teachers with two dozen or more kids in a class, it has nothing to do with the needs of children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;(under age 6 he didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t hear well, and missed those under age 3 critical times)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More and more, scientists are finding the idea of &quot;critical stages&quot; is a fallacy and the only true critical periods occur in utero. But also keep in mind that a great deal of the &quot;education&quot; of kids with special needs has to do with trying to get them to seem normal - and the results of that involve kids with enormous deficits in self esteem. Help your son achieve what He wants to achieve - not in the sense of &quot;lets set some goals&quot; but in the sense of getting closer to him as a person so you can know his interests and aspirations in the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to begin?","postDate":"1325517928","msgId":64686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZCMzE5QUIzLTU4QjktNEMxQi05MUNFLUNDM0QzQTMwQUM2OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkcmhxOCs0M2JhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkcmhxOCs0M2JhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64685,"nextInTopic":64688,"prevInTime":64685,"nextInTime":64687,"topicId":64684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This might help: http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2012/01/what-if-parent-is-afraid.html It s short but has a link to more. -=.

It depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking for A Plan to put into place, well, don&#39;t ;-) Unschooling can&#39;t be done by formula. Radical unschooling is about meeting their needs as fellow human beings who need an atmosphere of  connection, trust, respect, support, kindness where they can pursue what interests them. It&#39;s pretty easy! And yet hard especially because most of the models we see of parents and children involve parents shaping their kids into being &quot;the best they can be.&quot; It isn&#39;t about getting to know who your kids are and supporting who they are at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.

Bodies provide a structure by needing food and sleep at periodic intervals. Beyond that it will depend on what each child needs. It will depend on what you need to provide for their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t see structure as a way to mold their time. See it as a way to get done in the day what each person in the family wants to do and what you want to do for those who are more joiners than independent explorers. Though for all of them you will need to be exposing them to parts of the world that you believe they might find interesting so they have the resources to expand their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With my boys as they are, I am considering a loose schedule they can participate it or not as they are interested.

Look at  how their energy ebbs and flows and focuses during the day and create a loose structure that matches their needs rather than your needs for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re the cruise director, the maker of things happening, but the foundation you&#39;re working from is their needs. To know their needs means getting to know each of them as individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways it&#39;s harder with lots of kids.
