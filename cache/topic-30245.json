On the flip side, as a reminder to the one being <br/>\nhit, I sometimes say &quot;Them&#39;s fightin&#39; words&quot;.  My older daughter, <br/>\nwhile generally a patient and kind person, will get fed up with her <br/>\nyounger sister and explode, then getting a violent reaction from her <br/>\nlittle sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux hits and kicks and screams when she is frustrated or upset <br/>\nabout things.  She&#39;s getting better, but it&#39;s a very long slow <br/>\nprocess for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nChamille doesn&#39;t tolerate that from her sister, and mostly I let her <br/>\nhandle it her own way.  She is getting better at it too.  She has a <br/>\nclear level of tolerance, and Marguax knows when she&#39;s stepped over <br/>\nthat threshold and does it anyway, testing her in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Chamille rearranged her whole room.  She wanted a cozy <br/>\ncomputer place to hang out in her room.  She invited her sister to <br/>\ncome and join her in her new space.  It was really sweet, and I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t invited, which was kinda cool too.  It made Margaux feel very <br/>\nspecial.  It was fun and there was a lot of laughter and joy in that <br/>\nroom that I wasn&#39;t allowed into.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt lasted about 40 min, until Margaux started getting too loud and <br/>\nwild in there, hitting Chamille over and over with a stuffed animal <br/>\nwith hard eyes, and after being asked and told repeatedly to stop, <br/>\nChamille got fed up, gave her a pinch on the arm, and told her to <br/>\nleave.  Margaux cried about it, but the message was clear and I was <br/>\nproud of Chamille for not accepting her sister&#39;s abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how life works, you just don&#39;t hit someone repeatedly and have <br/>\nthem ask you to stop and not do so, without some sort of <br/>\nrepricussion.  I&#39;ve always told my girls that if they are going to <br/>\nhit, then they should expect to get hit back, even if I tell them not <br/>\nto hit each other.  I told Chamille that she shouldn&#39;t have pinched <br/>\nher sister.  Chamille&#39;s response was that she wasn&#39;t stopping and she <br/>\nknew that if she gave her sister a pinch, which she deserved, then <br/>\nshe would leave, because asking her and telling her wasn&#39;t working.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting for me to accept this.  While in general I think <br/>\nretaliating is wrong, hitting back is wrong, and I don&#39;t condone such <br/>\nthings, I feel that Chamille handled the situation quite fairly and <br/>\nwithout anger, which is a huge big deal!  She could&#39;ve asked me to <br/>\ncome get Margaux, but she wanted to handle it on her own which was <br/>\ncool.  Then, when Margaux came crying to me, she was crying more <br/>\nabout being kicked out, than about being pinched, although that was <br/>\nher stated reason for crying.  Since Margaux is the &quot;hitter&quot; around <br/>\nhere, she knew clearly what she&#39;d done wrong and why she&#39;d been <br/>\nkicked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for those that don&#39;t know, Chamille is 13 and Margaux is 5, <br/>\nalmost 6, very different developmental ages and stages right now!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sibling rivalry","postDate":"1186888376","msgId":30291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVDQUtCQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY5a3ZqbCtiOWMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30290,"nextInTopic":30293,"prevInTime":30290,"nextInTime":30292,"topicId":30245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Kelly...I appreciate your words very much.

A few years ago, they could play for a while and then <br/>\ninevitably some irritation would come up and they might have a fight, <br/>\nbecause they needed a break (and usually some food, rest, etc.)  Now <br/>\nthey can play for extended times, and it is days between times when <br/>\nthere is a fight or irritation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow they have a younger brother who is 3, and my middle daughter has <br/>\nbig issues with him, is frequently irritated by him, is frequently <br/>\nunwilling to share anything of hers (dvd&#39;s, toy pieces, etc.) with <br/>\nhim, and will hit him so quickly in the event of a transgression that <br/>\neven if I am feet away, sometimes it happens in a moment and I cannot <br/>\nget there quickly to get between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been working really hard on thinking through what I have done <br/>\nand can do to create a better environment for all of them that will <br/>\nallow them to be safe and learn how to communicate.  A few things <br/>\nthat have helped me are:<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that I was being fair to everyone, but after scrutinizing <br/>\nmy reactions, I have always been a lot more defensive of the &quot;hittee&quot; <br/>\nwhether it was my younger daughter a few years ago, or my son now.  I <br/>\nhave really been trying hard to debrief as much with the hitter as <br/>\nwith the hittee, and to avoid blowing up in a mama bear sort of way <br/>\nat all costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere on another list a post by Ren Allen (another <br/>\nseasoned unschooler), that she will give the hitter a hug.  This is <br/>\nactually brilliant.  My interpretation is that she is demonstrating <br/>\ntrust that the hitter is really a good person, even though they just <br/>\nhit someone.  She also acknowledges that they are somewhere on the <br/>\npath to learning better communication skills, and need empathy and <br/>\ncommunication more than anything else to support the learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difficulty I have with implementing this strategy is that my <br/>\nson takes a long time to calm down, so when I go to him first, often <br/>\nby the time he is calm enough to be left on his own for a few minutes <br/>\nto go to my daughter, she is often totally over the episode, and <br/>\nmight be busy playing with her sister.  So she may not be as <br/>\ninterested in the hug and discussion.  Usually when it plays out like <br/>\nthat I just tell her I wanted to &quot;check and make sure she is okay, <br/>\nbecause she had to be really upset about something to hit her <br/>\nbrother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I have learned, is to try and see the joyous <br/>\ntimes in their relationships, of which there are lots, and growing <br/>\nover time.  I will work on mine and my husband&#39;s reactions to <br/>\nfighting and try to bolster our awareness of the opportunity to model <br/>\nbetter communicating.  I am trying to look at all other areas of <br/>\ntheir lives to make sure that the cup is fuller than it might be <br/>\nright now.  Putting those &quot;aware&quot; thoughts out into the forefront of <br/>\nmy consciousness helps me to make better decisions each and every <br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one last thought, which is really a question is this.  When I <br/>\nhave thought through what to say to my children when there is <br/>\nhitting, I have tried to think about the answer to &quot;why&quot; they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t hit.  I know that Sandra has used the jail/physical harm <br/>\nlogic, but I&#39;ve felt like that one sounds too harsh for my kids.  Any <br/>\nother logic for not hitting I&#39;ve come up with ultimately becomes a <br/>\nself-serving reason (like, if you hit your brother, he will be upset <br/>\nand then we will not be able to go to Target as quickly, because I&#39;ll <br/>\nhave to spend time with him to calm him down); not only that, it <br/>\nagain seems to refocus on the fact that her brother is doing <br/>\nsomething to irritate her.  So for now I&#39;ve dropped trying to share a <br/>\nreason why they shouldn&#39;t hit, I am just responding in the <br/>\ncircumstance and trying to use the gentleness and fairness described <br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I think about it though, I know that my oldest has expressed <br/>\na viewpoint that she feels like war is a bad thing, and maybe it&#39;s <br/>\npossible to say something like &quot;war might be what happens when people <br/>\ngrow up and can&#39;t talk about their problems and feel like they need <br/>\nto hit each other.&quot;  Thoughts on that???  Still not sure of the logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sibling rivalry","postDate":"1186837880","msgId":30277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWM3ZGMxOSQxYzYyYWIzMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBFYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY5amM1Nys0Yzk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30274,"nextInTopic":30278,"prevInTime":30276,"nextInTime":30278,"topicId":30245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But even as<br/>\nbabies my children learned to trust that I would try to meet their needs.<br/>\nThey spent their infancies at the breast and in arms.  It becomes a part of<br/>\nwho they are.  Would my children be different if they spent time in an<br/>\norphanage as babies?  I think so.  Absolutely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that my children came wired with their own personalities right<br/>\nfrom the start.  They both have always been very verbal and articulate.<br/>\nThey are both very sensitive people.  When they were small a few people<br/>\nsuggested to me that I made them as sensitive as they are by coddling them.<br/>\nBut the thing is, I coddled (held, nursed, cuddled) them because they seemed<br/>\nso sensitive and seemed to need to be close a lot.  (they cried when I put<br/>\nthem down, so I held them all the time)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they learned to negotiate with each other because I stayed close right<br/>\nfrom the start, most often playing with them, and I interceded BEFORE a<br/>\ncrisis developed. (we have a pretty small house and they hardly ever played<br/>\nout of ear shot.) I did not look at their relationship with each other and<br/>\nthink, well, siblings fight, it&#39;s just what they do, like some people I know<br/>\ndo.  I do not think that is helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is partially how one looks at things too.  I tend to see all the<br/>\ngood things and not focus on the bad.  When my kids do argue, we talk and<br/>\nsolve it and it passes and life becomes peaceful again quickly.  I have<br/>\nalways tended to see the cup as half full rather than half empty.  I am<br/>\nforever the optimist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may not be able to stop all conflicts with your children but if you stay<br/>\nclose and help them to work through them before they become a crisis, as<br/>\nwell as search for ways to lessen conflicts (buy another computer maybe)<br/>\nthen they will continue to get better at conflict resolution.  I still don&#39;t<br/>\nhow old they are but it got easier as they got older. At times when mine<br/>\nwere young and my friends from play groups were all hanging out with each<br/>\nother as the kids played (and sometimes fought), I always stayed close to<br/>\nmine and sometimes felt left out while I helped them to negotiate with each<br/>\nother and all the other kids.  I do not know any other siblings who get<br/>\nalong as well as mine do.  In fact, many of the siblings I know are just<br/>\nhateful to each other and the parents say nothing to them when they say<br/>\nhateful things to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to point out the difference in being close by physically without<br/>\nbeing close by mentally.  (not sure how to word that.)  You can be somewhere<br/>\nphysically but still not really be present with your children.  Not saying<br/>\nthat is what you do but I do know people who can be in the room with their<br/>\nkids and still not see a conflict coming because they are somewhere else in<br/>\ntheir minds.  I can see the crisis coming with their children long before<br/>\nthey do.  Maybe that is because their interpersonal skills are not as<br/>\nstrong.  Lots of factors to consider but worth the effort to help where you<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sibling rivalry","postDate":"1186812554","msgId":30274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDQTEzQTk4LUU1OTItNDQ5OS1COTMyLTNDMEExMEU2QUJDOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY5amM1Nys0Yzk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGY5amM1Nys0Yzk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30273,"nextInTopic":30277,"prevInTime":30273,"nextInTime":30275,"topicId":30245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-And, if I can stop what I m doing, I do take one of them away from the situation and find something to do with them that they enjoy, which works to resolve","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-256447990\">-=-And, if I can<br/>\nstop what I&#39;m doing, I do take one of them away from the situation<br/>\nand find something to do with them that they enjoy, which works to<br/>\nresolve that particular situation, but I don&#39;t know that it helps<br/>\nthem to adopt the principle of kindness.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was kind of you to get the younger one into a safe place, or kind  <br/>\nof you to remove the older one from the younger&#39;s immediate  <br/>\nvicinity.

They rarely, if ever (I really can&#39;t <br/>\nrecall a time), will do this if I am playing with them.

So, I just can&#39;t attribute (at least not &quot;mostly&quot;) a lack of <br/>\nsibling rivaly to &quot;good parenting.&quot; I think there are many, heavier-<br/>\nweighing, factors. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my youngest two kids are both adopted. My youngest lived <br/>\nin an orphanage before living with us. Even though she didn&#39;t live <br/>\nthere all that long, as you all probably know, babies&#39; brains <br/>\nget &quot;wired&quot; into certain patterns right from the beginning. More <br/>\nspecifically, when their basic needs are not being met, and they <br/>\nhaven&#39;t bonded with their birth mother, that sets off certain <br/>\nresponses in their brain that affects their overall development and <br/>\npersonality. I think this has A LOT to do with how my kids respond to <br/>\neach other. This is something I can work on with good parenting <br/>\nskills, but I don&#39;t think they respond to each other due to any kind <br/>\nof lack of good parenting skills. I guess this is what offended me <br/>\nabout my neighbor&#39;s comment. It was as if she was saying to me, &quot;Your <br/>\nkids wouldn&#39;t fight, too, if you were a better parent.&quot; Of course I <br/>\nknow she wasn&#39;t saying this, but like Sandra&#39;s friends with the same-<br/>\nage babies as her own, you know that&#39;s what they&#39;re thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now I&#39;m just whining. I know that the why doesn&#39;t really matter <br/>\none whit. I did, however, clarify my thoughts (thanks, everyone, for <br/>\nyour help with this), and I will, now, encourage my children to watch <br/>\nout for the care and safety of each other instead of just keeping <br/>\nthat to myself.

Sometimes it actually throws me for a loop because I so rarely have<br/>\nto deal with discord between them.  One of the days when they got frustrated<br/>\nwith each other, they were playing nicely together later and really having<br/>\nfun, and I made a point to ask them if life is better because they have a<br/>\nsibling most of the time and if they thought our home would be a lot less<br/>\ninteresting and fun if they did not have each other.  They agreed and even<br/>\nagreed that they loved each other and would not want to be without each<br/>\nother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard at times but it&#39;s been so worth it to invest the time I have in<br/>\ntheir relationships with each other.
