The boys are 13 and almost 17.   <br/>\nThey came late the Sunday before Christmas, and we all stayed up into the<br/>\nwee hours, talking until the kids passed out. <br/>\nMonday we went shopping for stocking stuffers for everyone and wandered<br/>\naround and ate Chinese food and stopped in a funky little shop that sells<br/>\nall things Celtic.   We listened to the guy play the uilleann (sp) pipes<br/>\nand there was a woman there buy and trying out low whistles.   Very cool.<br/>\n  And we found the most amazing chocolate mints there...<br/>\nWe came home and watched National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation.  <br/>\nTuesday we cooked and listened to music and baked and talked and strung<br/>\ndried berries and fruit for the birds, then hung it in the pine tree and<br/>\nwatched the dog try to jump for it.   <br/>\nThe 17 year old is a musician and he played guitar for us and little bits<br/>\non the piano.   He liked some of the old songs I learned from my aunt and<br/>\ntried to play them.   We looked for the music on the Internet and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find it, but he left with a good idea how to play some of them<br/>\non guitar.   <br/>\nWe went to the Catholic service Christmas eve, it was beautiful.   The<br/>\nonly one who&#39;s Catholic is my brother in law but his family goes at<br/>\nChristmas.   David and Dylan had never been.  That&#39;s amazing because even<br/>\nI had been before, me, the heathen, with Catholic friends.<br/>\nChristmas morning we opened stockings and made a huge breakfast and<br/>\nopened more gifts.  After visitors and neighbors had wandered in and out<br/>\nagain we made some soup and loaded up and went snowshoeing.   We haven&#39;t<br/>\nhad a lot of snow so we drove north of town to Millers lake and finally<br/>\nfound enough snow to make it worthwhile.   We wanted to go across the<br/>\nlake so David went out first to check the ice.   There is an enticing<br/>\nlittle island in the middle and we thought that would be a good<br/>\ndestination but the ice wasn&#39;t strong enough and David had to come back. <br/>\n He&#39;s not very tall, and kind of stocky, and he came back to shore with<br/>\nthe determination of a small bulldozer, all that adrenaline I suppose,<br/>\nand a big grin and one wet boot.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nWe headed into the trees instead.   It was a glorious day.   Dylan and<br/>\nEvan went way out ahead of us slower folk and liked being the trail<br/>\nblazers.   They saw an owl and came back to report it.   We saw elk and<br/>\ndeer. <br/>\nI saw the first Blue jays and Stellers jays I&#39;ve seen all winter. <br/>\nWe stopped and built a fire and ate hot soup and crusty bread.   We made<br/>\nhot chai and everyone was happily buzzing for the hike out.   We couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel our toes when we got back to the cars.<br/>\nOn the drive out from the lake we stopped where we had found a deer skull<br/>\nlast summer, a big one with the rack still on it.  We couldn&#39;t find it<br/>\nagain in the snow, but there were juniper trees there on the south side<br/>\nof this little hill and they were full of Cedar waxwings.   Evan said it<br/>\nwas the Christmas tree that God made.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe all changed into warm things when we got home and watched &quot;A Christmas<br/>\nstory.&quot;  The boys knew the dialog by heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday everyone had different plans and my plan was just to stay in bed<br/>\nforever.  The dogs got me up at six but I went back to bed after they ate<br/>\nand went outside.   David went downstairs at seven thirty and I heard him<br/>\nsay, &quot;Oh my God!&quot;  Imagining a pile of poo or a big huge hair ball or<br/>\nsomething nasty I sprang out of bed and flew downstairs to find the<br/>\nChristmas tree had fallen over.   I hadn&#39;t heard a thing.  It was<br/>\nvertical at six, I had both eyes open, I would have noticed.   David is<br/>\nthe get excited and panic a little type so he ran back upstairs to get<br/>\nhis shoes on and I just grabbed that tree and yanked it up, Bruce Willis<br/>\nstyle.   If it had gone south it would have leaned up against the big<br/>\nwindow and maybe slithered down from there.  If it had gone east it would<br/>\nhave cleared off my plate rail and all my stoneware and Polish pottery.  <br/>\nWest and it would have got the piano and all the pictures and candles and<br/>\nthe little paper model of the Globe theater.  But it went quietly and<br/>\nhappily north, and laid right down through the kitchen doorway.  Only the<br/>\ntree topper broke.  I was feeling a little sentimental about that, it was<br/>\nthe topper we bought our first Christmas together.  Nothing special, the<br/>\nbox still said $2.99, we bought it at the Pay n Pack in Wasilla, Alaska. <br/>\n Then, Dylan told me it wasn&#39;t that topper made our Christmas&#39;s special,<br/>\nbut our Christmas&#39;s that made the topper special.   He bought me new<br/>\ntopper that afternoon, an old fashioned looking Santa.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid had to work New years day but the rest of us stayed up and finally<br/>\ndrank some of that bottle of champagne that had been in our fridge since<br/>\nNew years eve 2000.  It wasn&#39;t very good champagne to begin with, and the<br/>\nageing didn&#39;t improve it any.   We built blue bird houses New years day<br/>\nand some have gone back to Colorado now, but the others will go up when<br/>\nwe get the information from the bluebird trails folks about where to<br/>\nplace them.   Always and forever now we have to maintain them for the<br/>\nbluebirds, like responsible landlords.   <br/>\nThe first bird I saw in 2003 wasn&#39;t a bluebird, but the pigeon with a<br/>\nbroken wing and pneumonia who is recovering (noisily) in our living room.<br/>\n  But after that there were little House finches.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe couldn&#39;t have asked for a nicer holiday.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I took my mother (she&#39;ll be 81 in March) and her sister (85)<br/>\nshopping in the next town at Wal-mart. <br/>\nToday was the third and that means it&#39;s the day these ladies get their<br/>\nsocial security checks.  It also, always means Wal-mart day.   <br/>\nI hate Wal-mart.   But I got to go to the thrift store and I found used<br/>\nPendleton wool shirts, just right for cutting up and making rugs, SUCH a<br/>\nfind, five good shirts for $12.00.   I was in heaven until I got home and<br/>\nDavid said he liked them and they&#39;d be good work shirts and how COULD I<br/>\ncut up such good shirts for hooked rugs?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll cut up his old cotton shirts tomorrow for braided rugs<br/>\ninstead.&lt;g&gt;  One way or another, we will have rugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan&#39;s playing a Crash Bandicoot game he found for Playstation at the<br/>\nthrift store, while his dad gives pointers.  None of the pointers are<br/>\nhelpful and there&#39;s a lot of good natured arguing going on out there.  <br/>\nI&#39;m off to walk the dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you&#39;re all recovering from too much food and too much cheer.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11455,"nextTopicId":11486}}
