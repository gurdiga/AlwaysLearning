But they’re good questions to look at as evidence of a lack of partnership with the child.  If you change to your child’s partner, the questions will dissolve.  The way they’re asked, it seems the mom controls and limits the child, until one day she stops and he must control and limit himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few weeks (when you’ve read Pam Laricchia’s intro, which takes a few weeks of short e-mails coming every few days, with things to try and consider), go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/search\">http://sandradodd.com/search</a> and put in “control” and read some things.  Use the bottom search box, which includes several sites.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen search “self-regulate.”  It’s not a good goal to have for a child, nor for a parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen look at “choices.”  Your life will get easier. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-At what age do you begin relinquishing those decisions to the child? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don’t think of them as “decisions,” you have nothing to relinquish.  <br/>\nI began considering my child’s preferences the day he was born.  I tried to see if he was comfortable, and I did what seemed to make him more comfortable.  When I had a second child, and a third, I was more practiced at what might help, and at seeing what the baby was trying to communicate.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Are there signs you can watch for or see that indicate your child is able to self-regulate?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are signs you can watch for and see that indicate what your child wants, and as his adult partner you can help him get those.  Warmer or colder?  More comfortable clothes?  Shoes he likes?  Food he likes, in easy-to-use containters?  A chair he can get in and out of?  Music or videos that make him smile and dance?
