Often that has been <br/>\nme or my partner, but now and then another adult friend will step <br/>\nup.

Lewi, my son, is 7. He&#39;s always been quite volatile emotionally and <br/>\nvery expressive when it comes to his emotions - particular the angry ones. <br/>\nWhen he has playdates with only one other child there seems to be very <br/>\nlittle difficulty. He seems to rarely get angry and hardly ever not gets to <br/>\nan overwhelmed state. If an issue does arise both children seem to be able <br/>\nto problem solve mostly on their own and work through things smoothly <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, whenever we play with more than one child - bet it a friend with <br/>\nhis/her siblings or our unschooling groups with quite arange of children he <br/>\ntends to be dominant and bossy and is quick to get angry when things aren&#39;t <br/>\ngoing his way both with me and with the other children. He can really get <br/>\nquite angry and &#39;in your face&#39; and it can be really intimidating for others <br/>\naround us (and me too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;ve gone through abit of a parenting slump (very unfortunately) <br/>\nand got into some negative parenting (probably really disconnecting at those <br/>\ntimes rather than connecting due to my lack of ability to handle his <br/>\nemotions at the moment in public). I feel like I&#39;m back to my old self much <br/>\nmore again but I feel like I need some extra help in working out what to do <br/>\nto help Lewi in these situations as well as keeping everyone else around us <br/>\nfeeling OK and safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Naomi Aldort&#39;s book and use validation alot although I&#39;ve felt, in my <br/>\nparenting &#39;slump&#39; that it was no way near enough for those really tense <br/>\nsituations and I&#39;d forgotten some of the other strategies I&#39;d used in the <br/>\npast. On re-reading Connection Parenting and some of the Non Violent <br/>\nCommunication and PET I have got back into stating things from a needs point <br/>\nof view eg: When I see you yell at ....I feel worried because I have a need <br/>\nfor everyone to feel safe. etc. That sort of thing. As well as the usual <br/>\nvalidating etc. The thing is I&#39;ve felt so concerned about other people&#39;s <br/>\nchildren that I&#39;d become abit controling in my approach and expectations <br/>\nwhen Lew got angry. This certainly did not help and only caused <br/>\ndisconnection between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that having plays in a one on one situation would be good for the <br/>\ntime being but he really enjoys getting together with our unschooling groups <br/>\nand families with more than one child. I&#39;ve been talking with two families <br/>\nabout strategies etc we can use. I&#39;m just not sure whether I should put Lew <br/>\ninto those situations again so soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love some help to work through some of this as I&#39;m finding it really <br/>\nstressful and I know Lewi must be too (although he always comes away from <br/>\nsituations when he&#39;s been angry and upset at someone/me with happy thoughts <br/>\nand a feeling of having fun). I just want to remain connected and not feel <br/>\ncranky and irritated myself which I think was a pattern I was getting into <br/>\n(which sickened me about myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30176,"nextTopicId":30193}}
