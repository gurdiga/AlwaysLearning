But<br/>\nthere&#39;s no fines, and the notices are generally sent when things are 3<br/>\nmonths overdue, so most folks figure, SO WHAT!!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI always wonder why they bother with due dates in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda <br/>\nwho has a library book from before Thanksgiving that she really is going to<br/>\nread someday soon....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12384,"nextTopicId":12341}}
