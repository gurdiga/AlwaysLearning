You don&#39;t get &quot;good samples&quot; at any one point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice about letting kids move out and away when they want to,  <br/>\nand how they want to, is important.  It&#39;s the basis of attachment  <br/>\nparenting.  If you don&#39;t leave toddlers in daycare, and you let them  <br/>\nsit by you or on you or hold your hand when they want to, then when  <br/>\nthey DO move away a little, you know for sure that they wanted to,  <br/>\nthat they felt confident about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was 12 he wanted to be by himself.  I remember thinking he  <br/>\nwas being cruel to Marty and Holly by wanting them away from him all  <br/>\nthe time, and I was blaming it on our having moved (just a few miles,  <br/>\nbut he didn&#39;t want to move).  But I thought later it was just his age  <br/>\nand his need to have more time alone as he was going through those  <br/>\nphysical changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next year he started spending time at a gaming shop up the road  <br/>\n(good thing we moved! &lt;g&gt;) and when he was 14 they hired him, because  <br/>\nthey had seen him a lot and gotten to know him, he had been helpful  <br/>\nlots of times, and was good at helping other people understand  <br/>\ngames.

I think some <br/>\nindividuals like a nudge now and then, but Jeffrey has always been <br/>\nthe kind of person to choose his own timing.  I&#39;m reminded of when <br/>\nhe wanted to try TaeKwonDo.  A kid in his Kindergarten class brought <br/>\nin a TKD belt for show and tell and it impressed Jeffrey.  We went <br/>\nto a TKD place to observe classes.  My youngest daughter Allison is <br/>\n20 months younger than Jeffrey.  She is an impulsive person, like <br/>\nme, and signed up on the spot.  Jeffrey watched her classes for 6 <br/>\nmonths before he asked to join.  I think my DH is having a hard time <br/>\nletting our son take the lead on things because he&#39;s getting close <br/>\nto high school age.

In fact, Jeffrey wants his <br/>\nbirthday centered on Game Stop.  Jeffrey doesn&#39;t like opening <br/>\npresents because he doesn&#39;t like surprises.  Instead, we take him <br/>\nshopping for his birthday gifts.  The past several birthdays have <br/>\nbeen spent at the Lego Store.  This year he wants to go to Game <br/>\nStop.  He&#39;s so excited!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You could sit and make a list of all the academic subjects that<br/>\n&gt; are covered through the different video games he&#39;s playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very true!

He&#39;s <br/>\npicked up history from playing those games.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe instead of &quot;pulling in&quot; you could think of &quot;branching out&quot;<br/>\n&gt; from where his interests already are.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great idea.  I should learn more about the games so I can share some <br/>\nsuggestions with Jeffrey.  He reads about games in magazines and <br/>\nonline so he chooses his own games and knows an incredible amount <br/>\nabout them, but I don&#39;t much about them at all.  I need to take more <br/>\nof an active interest in his passion.  Perhaps even if my DH <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;see&quot; it, my DH will feel better knowing I am involved in our <br/>\nson&#39;s interests and learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat resonates within me actually.  My DH has always trusted my <br/>\ninstinct in homeschooling decisions.  He tells me he happily shares <br/>\nwith coworkers that our homeschooling is going so well because I am <br/>\nso passionate about our children.  No wonder my DH is worried <br/>\nlately.  Jeffrey spends so much time in his room alone with his <br/>\nvideo games.  I need to get in there and be with him.

(She also  <br/>\ndiscovered that though she enjoyed it she definitely didn&#39;t want a  <br/>\ncollege that is that intense.

Along with  <br/>\nmore art. At 16 she discovered social needs which got added into the  <br/>\nmix and spends several hours on the phone and IMs and interacts on  <br/>\nDeviantart and Facebook. She knew of those things before but it was  <br/>\nlike &quot;Why?&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just would not have been interested in &quot;intellectual&quot; stuff at  <br/>\n12.

My son (just 13) wanted to go out very little <br/>\nduring his 12 year old year.  He has been very involved in computer activities.  He plays <br/>\nWOW and is also very into Roblox (which your son might like if he hasn&#39;t discovered it <br/>\nalready).  But things seem to be changing.  They changed on his 13th birthday <br/>\n(yesterday!).  He had a long talk with me and told me what some of the changes he&#39;s <br/>\ndecided to make are.  Some of them have to do with how he seems himself and interacts <br/>\nwith others, and I had already noticed that change when he decided to tell me about it, so I <br/>\nknow he&#39;s pretty serious.  It actually reminded me of how he decided to potty train.  Right <br/>\nafter his 3rd birthday he announced that he&#39;d no longer wear diapers.  There was no lead <br/>\nin--no consistently dry ones at night or using the potty during the day--he annouced it <br/>\nand did it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I was trying to make is that he might still be percolating inside and not be ready <br/>\nto show the world yet.  But trying to force him doesn&#39;t seem like the way to go.  Through <br/>\nthe intensity of his interest in video games, he will likely find himself.  It can challenge us <br/>\nto see our children be so narrowly focused in a &quot;well-rounded&quot; world, but when you <br/>\nconcentrate the beam of a Magnalite flashlight, it has so much more power than when it is <br/>\ndiffused.  I would keep providing him with a good variety of games, and see if you can <br/>\nbranch out through the games he likes into websites and chat rooms about the games, or <br/>\nmovies with similar characters--think Tomb Raider (great flick!), stuff like that.  Field trips <br/>\nto the video store.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==That&#39;s why my DH suggested we pull some academics <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in to our day.  He likes to see Jeffrey &quot;learning&quot; by discussing <br/>\n&gt; math concepts and reading books aloud and discussing them. ==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could sit and make a list of all the academic subjects that are covered through the <br/>\ndifferent video games he&#39;s playing.  Aside from being filled with mathematical concepts <br/>\nlike complex puzzle solving, many of them have great stories, as well as beautiful artwork <br/>\nand good music.  My kids have been excited to hear the classical pieces that are in their <br/>\nvideo games.  Maybe instead of &quot;pulling in&quot; you could think of &quot;branching out&quot; from where <br/>\nhis interests already are.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My son and unschooling","postDate":"1215200964","msgId":36132,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJFQTc3M0UyLTc1NjgtNENEMS1CRTE4LUM2Nzg1QzdFQTI3MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc0bHNrYSs2bGVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc0bHNrYSs2bGVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36128,"nextInTopic":36140,"prevInTime":36131,"nextInTime":36133,"topicId":36128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But my DH has gotten frustrated because strewing doesn t work with Jeffrey.

My DH used to be so on board with unschooling but started <br/>\nchanging his mind when he realized how narrowly focused Jeffrey can <br/>\nbe.  My DH isn&#39;t interested in schooling our son, but he does want <br/>\nto find a way to help our son explore the world around him.  Jeffrey <br/>\ncan be challenging sometimes because of the things he doesn&#39;t like.  <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t like going outside (bugs and weather), swimming (hates <br/>\nwater in or near his face), museums, fiction, and traveling away <br/>\nfrom home, just to name a few.  When we do get him to agree on going <br/>\nsomewhere, he withdraws and is with us only physically.  He trails <br/>\nalong and continually asks, &#39;how much longer until we go home.&#39;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH and I definitely agree that putting our son in a school would <br/>\nbe harmful.
