The mentality toward women really struck me, <br/>\nand I had to comment on a few things here and there, but otherwise it <br/>\nwas fairly entertaining.

Almost <br/>\neveryone will get at least one right, and nobody really cares if anybody gets <br/>\nANYTHING right!<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds fun, making a trivia game.  I have a piece of advice--people shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe too strict about the answers.  There are errors in some of the games out <br/>\nthere, and sometimes answers change, or questions are worded in an ambiguous <br/>\nfashion.  So instead of fighting about &quot;wrong&quot; answers, maybe find a way to <br/>\nconsider more than one answer right.  More winners means more winning!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"homeschoolmd","from":"&quot;homeschoolmd&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"riding a bike","postDate":"1013996960","msgId":4930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE0cG1qMCtob20xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4935,"prevInTime":4929,"nextInTime":4931,"topicId":4930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I ve taken Sandra s advice and for the past few days, I ve been riding the bike or in other words, unschooling instead of thinking about unschooling.
