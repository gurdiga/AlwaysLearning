I think calling it &quot;being dramatic&quot; is probably both fairly accurate and extremely unhelpful. Accurate because she may have just returned from an environment where extreme behavior was the only (perceived) way to get one&#39;s needs met. Unhelpful, because labeling behavior as &quot;merely&quot; dramatic is usually the first step towards dismissing whatever is behind it as unimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, the child is in pain, and these are the lengths to which she feels she has to go to get her needs met. One thing I think it&#39;s hard for free children to appreciate is how much pressure most other children are under. If you&#39;ve never been forced to go to a camp or school or home where you didn&#39;t want to be, it&#39;s hard to understand how, uh, we&#39;ll, how f-ed up it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some examples of some responses that could bring you all closer: when your niece embellishes her story for dramatic effect, and you discuss it with your son you might point out that it&#39;s a bummer that she thinks she has to do that to get sympathy, how can we help her feel our love so she doesn&#39;t need to do that? Point out that if she &quot;plays mean&quot; it almost certainly indicates that someone else was very mean indeed to her in the past, and she doesn&#39;t know how to do to process those feelings without &quot;spreading them around&quot;. Excrement tumbles in a generally downward direction, if you catch my drift. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;teresa&quot; &lt;treesock@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re staying for three weeks with my mom in Central Florida where my sister also lives with her 7-year-old daughter. I&#39;m writing to ask for some insight into how to handle some pretty intense and--to me--disturbing conflicts between my niece and my oldest boy, 6.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My niece spent the summer away from her mom for the first time, with her dad in Atlanta attending a YMCA daycamp, which she says she didn&#39;t like. She has a tough time with her two stepsisters up there, too. She came back to her mom&#39;s the same day we arrived. And my sister is pregnant, due some time in the next two weeks. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s backstory; there&#39;s a lot going on for my niece. Oh, and she&#39;s a schooled kid--Montessori from pre-k until now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She and my oldest boy have always argued some, but this visit, her behavior during and after conflicts (over stuff like who gets to play with which toy, whether the pretend scenario will involve pets or soldiers, etc.) is really ugly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My niece is really quick to assume that she is being slighted, that everyone is angry with her, that we all like whomever she is in conflict with better than her. My family calls this &quot;being dramatic,&quot; but I&#39;ve never met another child like this, and I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the best way to put it. She sometimes seems to invent slights from thin air--&quot;You think I&#39;m stupid!&quot; &quot;You took that because you want all the nice things for yourself and for me to have nothing!&quot; &quot;You just did that so you&#39;d win every time!&quot;--and spins a truly awful version of what happened full of false facts and accusations. As she&#39;s telling these stories, she parrots my older boy&#39;s voice unkindly, making an exaggerated, contorted face. She doesn&#39;t do this with my 3 year old, but when she gets mad at him, she yells at him. My boys often are staring in disbelief as this unfolds, but my older boy is increasingly losing patience with her, and yells from the other room that she&#39;s not telling the truth about what happened. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this making sense? It feels generalized, but the straight facts look kind of weird: There was a conflict over play, she had a meltdown, verbal ugliness ensued. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They play together well 90% of the time, but that 10% is brutal. My older son came to me last night and told me he two things: he didn&#39;t like how she &quot;lied&quot; about what happened after a conflict, and he didn&#39;t like how she played &quot;mean&quot; sometimes (which I couldn&#39;t really pin down). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what to do about this. We&#39;re going to be here a while longer. They spend a good amount of time together every day or every couple of days. Almost every playtime together includes at least one of these blow-ups. It doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference if I&#39;m playing with them or not--there are just as many conflicts, and the blow-ups are just as loud and angry. My sister--her mother--uses threats at this time. But mostly I&#39;ve been trying to take my niece out and about with us by myself to allow my sister some rest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My boys love to play with her, until they don&#39;t. I&#39;ve been trying a week already to come up with some way to work with this, but I&#39;m coming up with nothing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts much appreciated.

On top of this, he is two years bigger than most three year olds. When we moved recently, a sensitive child (who is 7) had major reactions to him. She acted similarly to what you describe your niece acting. Luckily this girls parents are pretty observant and respectful of their daughter and my son, and they managed to figure out that she felt threatened by him (and rightly so, he can be pretty daunting!). What we, as parents, came up with as a solution was that we would give the girl time and physical space so that she could feel in control still - my son always wanted to play with their family, so we were there a lot.

It helps for him to think about WHY another person would react that way toward him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would try to help your son empathize with his cousin, whether you stay there longer or not.

Maybe work together on a big sister party where she is the queen and gets gifts and attention and wins all the games.....And give your kids extra treats when she&#39;s not there to help balance it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaryann<br/>\nson 6, daughter 2</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"Andrea Q","from":"&quot;Andrea Q&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: The cousin&#39;s very angry eruptions","postDate":"1344907972","msgId":68603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswYzlzNCs5cHVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGswYnFibytsZW5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68601,"nextInTopic":68604,"prevInTime":68602,"nextInTime":68604,"topicId":68600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- That s backstory; there s a lot going on for my niece. -=- Not unschooling, but: It sounds like she needs as much of her mom s time, love and reassurance","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1977721745\">-=- That&#39;s backstory; there&#39;s a lot going on for my niece. -=- <br/>\n<br/>\nNot unschooling, but:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like she needs as much of her mom&#39;s time, love and reassurance as possible over the next couple of weeks.

I m writing to ask for some insight into","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1282307022\">We&#39;re staying for three weeks with my mom in Central Florida where my sister also lives with her 7-year-old daughter. I&#39;m writing to ask for some insight into how to handle some pretty intense and--to me--disturbing conflicts between my niece and my oldest boy, 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece spent the summer away from her mom for the first time, with her dad in Atlanta attending a YMCA daycamp, which she says she didn&#39;t like. She has a tough time with her two stepsisters up there, too. She came back to her mom&#39;s the same day we arrived. And my sister is pregnant, due some time in the next two weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s backstory; there&#39;s a lot going on for my niece. Oh, and she&#39;s a schooled kid--Montessori from pre-k until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and my oldest boy have always argued some, but this visit, her behavior during and after conflicts (over stuff like who gets to play with which toy, whether the pretend scenario will involve pets or soldiers, etc.) is really ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece is really quick to assume that she is being slighted, that everyone is angry with her, that we all like whomever she is in conflict with better than her. My family calls this &quot;being dramatic,&quot; but I&#39;ve never met another child like this, and I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the best way to put it. She sometimes seems to invent slights from thin air--&quot;You think I&#39;m stupid!&quot; &quot;You took that because you want all the nice things for yourself and for me to have nothing!&quot; &quot;You just did that so you&#39;d win every time!&quot;--and spins a truly awful version of what happened full of false facts and accusations. As she&#39;s telling these stories, she parrots my older boy&#39;s voice unkindly, making an exaggerated, contorted face. She doesn&#39;t do this with my 3 year old, but when she gets mad at him, she yells at him. My boys often are staring in disbelief as this unfolds, but my older boy is increasingly losing patience with her, and yells from the other room that she&#39;s not telling the truth about what happened. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this making sense? It feels generalized, but the straight facts look kind of weird: There was a conflict over play, she had a meltdown, verbal ugliness ensued. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey play together well 90% of the time, but that 10% is brutal. My older son came to me last night and told me he two things: he didn&#39;t like how she &quot;lied&quot; about what happened after a conflict, and he didn&#39;t like how she played &quot;mean&quot; sometimes (which I couldn&#39;t really pin down). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do about this. We&#39;re going to be here a while longer. They spend a good amount of time together every day or every couple of days. Almost every playtime together includes at least one of these blow-ups. It doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference if I&#39;m playing with them or not--there are just as many conflicts, and the blow-ups are just as loud and angry. My sister--her mother--uses threats at this time. But mostly I&#39;ve been trying to take my niece out and about with us by myself to allow my sister some rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys love to play with her, until they don&#39;t. I&#39;ve been trying a week already to come up with some way to work with this, but I&#39;m coming up with nothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts much appreciated.
