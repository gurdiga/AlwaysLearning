It seems I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-845938728\">I&#39;ve always had a hard time responding to people, especially &quot;authorities&quot; and when I feel people are really questioning my ability or judgment. It seems I always figure out what to say hours or days *after* the incident.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lurking a bit, and just now reading the chat transcript about relatives, I am prompted to share one strategy I&#39;ve been practicing for responding to (usually unwanted or rude) questions and comments from relatives and friends and even strangers. Interestingly I learned this last year from my now 18yr old son, who was partly schooled and partly unschooled as he grew up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwhile back he started randomly repeating back things that people said.  It went something like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: your hair is messy<br/>\nHim: *your* hair is messy<br/>\nMe: &lt;feeling puzzled, I just brushed my hair&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: your stove is on<br/>\nHim: *your* stove is on <br/>\nMe: what? &lt;feeling puzzled, how would he know that, we aren&#39;t there&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nperson: are you going to wear that? <br/>\nHim: are *you* going to wear that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you probably get the idea of the strategy.  Repeat whatever that person said, emphasizing *them* as the subject of the statement or question.  I find it takes some practice to remember to do it off the cuff so it sounds natural.  Practicing can be quite hilarious!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be a highly effective strategy for especially rude statements from people who would not otherwise be rude to you.  It illustrates the rudeness without having to come out and say &quot;gosh that&#39;s rude&quot; or &quot;none of your business&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBONUS it give you a bit more time to get over the shock of being treated in an inappropriate or unwelcome manner and think up another response.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am imagining this dialog right now...<br/>\n<br/>\ngrandma: why aren&#39;t you sending your kids to school?<br/>\nmom: why aren&#39;t *you* sending *your* kids to school?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can grandma respond?  Maybe grandma&#39;s kids are probably to old for school, and you know it, which makes her pause, confused.  Or maybe she has kids in school, and you know it at which point she can say &quot;I am&quot;, confused.  Or maybe grandma stops and realizes that she has probably accidentally irritated you and it&#39;s probably not her place to butt in.  Well, the possible responses are endless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to having a well rehearsed response to obnoxiousness, there has been a side benefit to this, for me.  An increase in confidence about my choices.  It reminds me of psychology strategies where you pretend that you are confident or not afraid or whatever until it becomes real.  I DO feel more confident now than when I started saying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is of some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoying this group immensely,thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45776,"nextTopicId":15303}}
