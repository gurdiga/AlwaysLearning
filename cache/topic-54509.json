I&#39;d like to broaden it beyond just the UnNanny idea and more toward advocating for an income...or financial compensation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd ask is this good or bad for unschooling?

But I&#39;m realizing now it&#39;s the potential threat to our rights that has me bothered.  Homeschooling in IL is well protected, and there are a lot of people watching and working to see that it stays that way.  Being on top of (not to mention understanding) the process is not my forte so I am extremely grateful to those who ARE on top of things.  I&#39;m in touch with them and I know them personally and I attend their workshops at our state conference so I can learn more.  When they say jump, I ask how high.  I thank them for what they do.  It bothers me that some unschoolers are willing to put it all out there (for whatever reasons) and risk further scrutiny.  Anyone who&#39;s read the comments can see that some people get so upset they scream that this should be illegal.  Legislators are often pressing for the compulsory age to be lowered, which often becomes a homeschooling issue.  Getting the public riled up about things like this doesn&#39;t help us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for respecting that someone is just trying to make a living doing something she loves to do...  yes, I agree, this is what we want for our children, this is a part of unschooling.  That said, most things - pottery, building sheds, cooking, performance art, etc etc etc - don&#39;t threaten the rights of others when pursued.  This can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people think homeschooling and especially unschooling should be illegal, and this just fans the flames.  I&#39;m all for someone making money doing what they love, so long as it doesn&#39;t sell the rest of us down the river.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m less concerned with her doing the Un-Nanny thing, because that isn&#39;t specifically an unschooling issue - it&#39;s more of a parenting issue.  And no one&#39;s going to take away our right to parent.  &lt;g&gt;  I do, however, have concerns about putting unschooling in the spotlight.  THAT right can be lost, or at least made far more difficult and complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the GMA segment I have a reporter who continues to call and email me, asking to do a piece on our family.  I&#39;ve actually taken the opportunity to explain to her exactly why I feel it&#39;s not a good idea.  I don&#39;t believe unschooling will go mainstream anytime soon; it&#39;s not information the general public needs (as a public service, let&#39;s say).  Those who need information on unschooling will find us.  Therefore, the only reason the network might want to do a piece is to generate ratings, buzz, capitalize on a hot topic in the national media.  That&#39;s the ONLY reason they&#39;d do it.  I told her that.  I also told her I&#39;m not comfortable offering up my children so they can boost their ratings, that I&#39;m not interested in being portrayed as a wacko so they can get more hits on their site.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been interviewed by the media many many times - not for unschooling - and they&#39;ve never, NEVER gotten it right.  Not even in print.  Not even when they recorded the entire interview.  Not even when it was live - because they write the &#39;lead in&#39; and set the tone there.  Most of the time it didn&#39;t matter or change the message, but it did when I was a speaker at an anti-war rally that attracted 500 people and they took only 6-8 words I said out of context, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know Dayna Martin personally and I assume she&#39;s a lovely person, especially knowing she has many fans and supporters.  But I&#39;m very uncomfortable with her willingness to put unschooling in the spotlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n&quot;Keep company with those who make you better.&quot; ~ English saying<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147283564,"authorName":"Jill Parmer","from":"Jill Parmer &lt;jparmer@...&gt;","profile":"jparm02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Money/Reward from Advocacy was ABC  News/Nightline unschooling story","postDate":"1275600564","msgId":54558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MkZCNUZGLTZDMjMtNDk4Ni05OTY5LURBNjRERkI0ODJCRUBmcmlpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrb2pHWndlcGNUOWtyTGMyMFZkajg3VnhIUXh2ZzRuN2hFR1ZrM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":54557,"nextInTopic":54559,"prevInTime":54557,"nextInTime":54559,"topicId":54509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One motivation for a person who felt that way might be to reach people who might become a part of the movement if they knew about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nVeering even farther and not making any statement about Dayna Martin at all, it might be a desire to share this really interesting thing that happened. My partner is a transsexual, and a long time ago we had a website aimed at people whose partners were in gender transition. <br/>\nfrom that, we got a couple of feelers from talk show producers looking for people to appear. I have not been on TV, but I have at different times been on panels talking about the transition, and I&#39;ve written and spoken about it as well. There are two things that motivate me when I&#39;ve done this. One is that having a partner change genders is--in addition to everything else it is--a really interesting experience that I sometimes like to talk about and think other people will also find interesting. The other is that talking honestly about a minority experience can lead to increased understanding and tolerance (meeting a transsexual man in person and listening to him talk about his life humanized transsexuals for David and me a long time ago, and was an important first step in paving the way for what has turned out to be a very good change in our lives.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, a third motivation for me is that I enjoy being the center of attention. I would not choose to be on TV or to be interviewed for a newspaper or magazine because of the distortions I&#39;ve seen that would undermine the goals I&#39;ve mentioned above, but certainly one motivation for me in writing about David&#39;s transition and our relationship has been, &quot;Hey! This really super-unusual thing happened to me! Here I am!

The idea of earning an income through ways you choose to live your life. If being an &quot;UNnanny&quot; can help provide for the family...then why not? I&#39;d like to broaden it beyond just the UnNanny idea and more toward advocating for an income...or financial compensation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd ask is this good or bad for unschooling? Or maybe a little of both? I think it would be wonderful related specifically to unschooling. I&#39;ll do my best. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends who are strongly against charging for mentoring...but these friends often times have husbands who pay all of the bills. I wonder why folks often have such negative reactions regarding others making money...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Dayna (or anyone else) is able to make a living by being with her family, doing what she does anyway...why not? And how is that different from someone giving their time away freely? Does that make their motivations more noble? What if a person gives away support for free and doesn&#39;t care about helping people but just doing it for the ego-sake? Which is better? Is there an ideal?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often times have multiple motivations. I know with our book (my hubby and I wrote a book about sexual abuse) we hope to derive some income from helping and advocating for people who&#39;ve been victimized...but we also just hope to help people. We give away free digital copies to victims of child sexual assault. Does that make us better than if we charged people? I (and Jeff) give away free email support daily...does that make us better people? Some people might look at giving away all the free support as just marketing and in a sense it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI take pictures and give away free advice to people about taking pictures. People tell me all the time I should charge...I don&#39;t. Money is not my primary motivation for doing it. Does that make my advice better than others? I don&#39;t think so. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is just a lot to think about. And I&#39;m genuinely curious how folks feel about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lots more thoughts but I don&#39;t want to go on forever. And although I gave an example from my life I still would like to hear people&#39;s thoughts on how it all relates to unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not one type of advocacy is superior to another and/or what people think about a combination of things. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMARKETPLACE<br/>\nStay on top of your group activity without leaving the page you&#39;re on - Get the Yahoo!

Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen and Rue Kream<br/>\n&gt; do that, too. They speak, for the most part, directly to those parents<br/>\n&gt; who want to unschool and are looking for help.

It&#39;s worrisome to some (perhaps many) folks<br/>\n&gt; in the community that legislators may take quite a dim view of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and look to tighten up state laws that&#39;ll make both<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and homeschooling more difficult, if they judge such<br/>\n&gt; things from the way unschooling is being presented in the media.

I know that Dayna was edited to look crazy.  However once you put the idea out there that &quot;history isn&#39;t important&quot;, it&#39;s out there to be cut and edited to stand alone, regardless of what was said directly prior and directly after.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be so much better to focus on what unschooling is and what unschoolers do, rather than what it is not and what they don&#39;t do, if you are going to present yourself to the general public.  The whole time I was watching it, I kept thinking about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer oldest kid was pretty great in that piece.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part I had an issue with, was the UnNanny part.  My first thought was &quot;I hope the dad is on board with that&quot;.  Here&#39;s the thing, for anyone willing to seek it out, the information to unschool is freely available online.  Nobody needs to hire a consultant to tell them what to do with their kids.  I know people do it, but it always surprises me.  That whole part may have been highly edited too, I don&#39;t know, but it had very little to do with radical unschooling, even though the other mom had said her purpose was to incorporate more unschooling into their homeschooling.  Part of really getting unschooling going for a parent, is thinking creatively about problem solving.  What they showed in that segment was one woman pointing to another woman a creative solution to help a child do what he wants to do.  What they didn&#39;t show was why the mom didn&#39;t want her child going to use the hammock.  It might have been a good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I wish people would just stop putting themselves out to the public in forums that are going to make them seem crazy.  It doesn&#39;t help unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing left me feeling kind of icky about unschooling and how it&#39;s perceived by others.  What I saw didn&#39;t reflect my experiences with unschooling, even taking into account the fact that it was greatly edited.

I couldn&#39;t believe they were going to end with that. Too cool. <br/>\nLeft people thinking about school as a place you go to learn and forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest wasn&#39;t great - Devon was adorable, I thought, but the overall <br/>\ntone of the piece didn&#39;t do Dayna&#39;s family justice and made it seem like <br/>\nunschoolers don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but are just sort of vaguely <br/>\ndrifting through life, having a good time. Sort of a &quot;Don&#39;t worry, be <br/>\nhappy,&quot; feeling that came across, I think, as not founded in any solid <br/>\nreasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Not that life might not FEEL that way - and be great. But not a great <br/>\nimage to project on national tv if we hope to be understood.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish people would just turn it down - at least this kind of thing that <br/>\nfollows kids around and quizzes them on multiplication facts, etc. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let my loving and truly concerned relatives do that and I <br/>\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t let the press do it.  Print media - I&#39;m more okay <br/>\nwith. LIVE radio and tv - better. These sort of miniature <br/>\ndocumentary/magazine style &quot;news&quot; pieces - not so much.<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ABC News/Nightline unschooling story","postDate":"1275522280","msgId":54510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEzRjE3RUYyMTUxQTRBODZCRURDMzI1RkJEMUYyMTA4QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1NjAzaytubGxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1NjAzaytubGxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54509,"nextInTopic":54511,"prevInTime":54509,"nextInTime":54511,"topicId":54509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thought the last line was really funny...
