As you know from reading my <br/>\nbook, the judge in my divorce didn&#39;t even know about homeschooling, and wasn&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in learning about it from my lawyer.  He didn&#39;t care if the <br/>\nchildren were at home or off to school, he just didn&#39;t count the hours of the <br/>\n&quot;schoolday&quot; as parent time, which is why I ended up paying child support.  I have <br/>\nbeen able to continue unschooling because by law I was entitled to half the <br/>\nmilitary retirement, which covers the rent - tho the rest of the budget is often <br/>\nVERY tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second Sandra, that if the issue is having the children at home to learn, <br/>\nit may be more important to have the marriage intact.  Divorce slams everything <br/>\nin your life into a new place.  It&#39;s tough, and if you can make the <br/>\nrelationship work out, I would encourage you to examine all possible options.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if you find you do need to be separate from your husband, then I wish <br/>\nyou stength, and good supportive friends - they were my lifeline.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19939,"nextTopicId":19958}}
