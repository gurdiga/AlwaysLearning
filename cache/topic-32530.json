Sort of.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nparticularly enjoy the school-ish part of school, but I loved the fact <br/>\nthat I could surround myself with people, teachers and other students, <br/>\nwho had interests and skills and passions similar to my own, writers <br/>\nand musicians and literature-lovers and scientists and mathematicians.  <br/>\nSince I came from a very working class background (coal mining), where <br/>\nacceptable interests were quite limited (hunting, drinking, and bar <br/>\nfighting topped the list - nothing wrong with that, I guess, but not <br/>\nthe past time of choice for a sensitive little boy who cried easily and <br/>\nread all the time and couldn&#39;t kill anything if his life depended on <br/>\nit), my teachers were always my first source of connection with a world <br/>\nof ideas and art that just didn&#39;t exist in my daily life.  Teachers <br/>\nwere my heroes, my friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even then, the teachers I admired the most were always the ones who <br/>\ntaught the least, in the standardized sense.  They were always the <br/>\nteachers who had the most difficulty inside the system and who always <br/>\nmanaged to connect with kids despite the institutional aspect of their <br/>\njobs, not because of it.  And right now, I&#39;m certain that most of the <br/>\nteachers I loved the most, the people who helped me most, would have a <br/>\nvery difficult time surviving in the current school environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my favorite teachers would be suspended, and all of my favorite <br/>\nstudents would be expelled.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;harmony&quot; &lt;harmony@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was at my lifeguard training tonight and I was talking to the 3 <br/>\npublic school teachers in the class.
