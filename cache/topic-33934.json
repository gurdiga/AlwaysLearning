My baby is just 10 months old, but I&#39;m looking at a <br/>\nsituation which looks likely to last a long time so I wanted to check <br/>\nin with you more experienced folks. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mildly demented, 90 year old, recently widowed grandfather had a <br/>\nfall last weekend and was trapped on the floor for 1-2 days. He has <br/>\nalways been stubborn and cranky regarding health issues: refused Life <br/>\nAlert, tells me I&#39;m crazy when I tell him that he didn&#39;t take his <br/>\npills, but wants to live forever, etc. At the same time, he is very <br/>\nsweet and loving. My DH and I get a kick out of him, and he LIVES for <br/>\nmy baby and dog, who has had to come live with us. My mom, his <br/>\ndaughter, is similar. She has had cancer for many years, is barely <br/>\nfunctioning independantly, can be very difficult about accepting <br/>\nhelp, and often only keeps fighting because of the baby. I try to be <br/>\nrespectful of their desires/autonomy, but their judgement is often <br/>\nimpaired due to their medical problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking into buying a house that grandpa could buy into with <br/>\nus, and probably mom could &quot;come stay&quot; in--more or less, move in <br/>\nwithout selling her home, since she is not well enough at this time <br/>\nto deal with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I were asking if I should do this!!!! But I feel strongly <br/>\nabout living my values, and that this is the right thing to do for a <br/>\nvariety of reasons. If nothing else I will no longer be dragging my <br/>\nkid all over maintaining 3 households.  I am just nervous in general, <br/>\nand nervous about unschooling my LO in this environment. Up to this <br/>\npoint, I assumed the likelihood of either of them living another 4 <br/>\nyears was unlikely, so DH and I made a conscious choice to not bring <br/>\nup homeschooling. My mom taught HS, and my grandpa&#39;s life goal is to <br/>\nsee her &quot;go to kindergarten.&quot; I&#39;m not too worried about that--it&#39;s <br/>\nmore the idea of not being free to go out and do whatever she wants, <br/>\nwhenever, that bothers me. We should have some nursing help check in, <br/>\nbut I&#39;d expect to be the main person helping them out. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have experience that you can share? I would really <br/>\nappreciate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33817,"nextTopicId":33941}}
