One of my friends just got a job there working as an <br/>\naid to the Heads-Start pre-k program.  She was telling us about some of <br/>\ntheir rules.  I&#39;ll share two:  NEVER any coloring pages or books to be <br/>\nused under any circumstances and there should be no recognition or <br/>\ncelebration of any holiday be it religious or historical (Thanksgiving).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my strong memories of elementary school are the holiday crafts. <br/>\n I think those are the only ones my mom ever held onto, so she could <br/>\nhaul them out every holiday to decorate the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really had to bite my tongue because both of my friends are pretty <br/>\nmuch pro-school education and I don&#39;t want to lose them as friends <br/>\nbecuase of my growing passion about unschooling, but good grief.  How <br/>\ncan they just accept all this ridiculous crap being forced (or in this <br/>\ncase, withheld) from their kids everyday? It&#39;s just like the parents who <br/>\ngot upset when their kids were pretending to be pregnant by putting <br/>\npillows up their shirts.  Is it that impossible to teach/share <br/>\ninformation objectively just for the joy of watching our children learn <br/>\nabout the real world we live in so they can decide for themselves where <br/>\nthey fit into it?  Honestly, if you can&#39;t bring up religion, then forget <br/>\ntalking about world history.  And if you can&#39;t color in a <br/>\npicture...well, hell, that&#39;s just plain fun to do AND really does help <br/>\none become a better artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just rambling...avoiding things I really should be working on. So <br/>\nanyway...<br/>\nNight, all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17236,"nextTopicId":17216}}
