Why isn&#39;t there a good unschooling one?  People write such<br/>\nincredible, beautiful, thoughtful things every day!  Wouldn&#39;t it be great to<br/>\nhave even just a weekly sampling of the best unschooling<br/>\nwritings-of-the-week in audio format?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone interested in doing this?  If there&#39;s interest, I&#39;d do it but if<br/>\nsomeone else is working on it I don&#39;t want to steal their thunder.  I am<br/>\naware of the radio Freeschool program and I enjoy it.  But I would like to<br/>\nsee (hear) something regularly and specifically about unschooling, and not<br/>\nfrom any one or a few experts but from lots of voices!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25514,"nextTopicId":25516}}
