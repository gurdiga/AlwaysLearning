We took the heads from the marigold plants last fall after they died, from the big garden, and we planted the seeds we saved around the perimeter of my box.  We did this to detract the deer a little.  If the deer get hungry enough, of course they&#39;ll just lean over the marigolds to eat the good stuff -- but I&#39;ve heard it deters them some.  I also saved some zinnia heads from last year, and Pauline wants those for her bright purple garden box.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll purchase some plants that are already started, then do some seeds as well.  Sunflowers are a great idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my 12 year old, Peter, was younger, we had planted some potatoes.  Well, they didn&#39;t do well, and we only got about 10 with our harvest.  He was 3, and enjoyed digging up the &quot;treasures&quot; so much, that whenever he went in the house, I&#39;d run out and &quot;re-plant&quot; the potatoes so he could find more!  He did this all day and never got tired of it.  What a fond memory.

I think I&#39;m unschooling!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the children wanted a raised vegetable bed of their own in the yard,<br/>\nso we let them each build their own (as far as they were able, depending on<br/>\ntheir ages), and they each picked out a color to paint there box.  I have<br/>\nbeen reading John Holt&#39;s Teach Your Own book, and realized through that (and<br/>\nthis list) that I&#39;ve been &quot;directing&quot; the children too much.  I decided to<br/>\nbite my tongue and just watch.  I didn&#39;t realize how difficult this would be<br/>\nfor me!<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge (my 5 year old) had a blast painting his box bright blue.  He set the<br/>\npaint can down on the grass kind of far away from his garden box.  He&#39;d dip<br/>\nthe brush in the paint, then carry it all the way over to the box, dripping<br/>\npaint the whole way, then slosh a little on (not much paint left on the<br/>\nbrush by this time), and did that over and over.  I wanted so bad to suggest<br/>\nhe take the can over to where the box was and he wouldn&#39;t waste as much<br/>\npaint.  But he was having so much fun this way!  He was really enjoying<br/>\nwatching the patterns he was making on the grass while he carried the brush<br/>\nover to the box.  Then on his own he moved the paint can closer eventually.<br/>\nWhen he was done, he left the paint can open.  I wanted to show him that he<br/>\nneeded to put the top back on, clean it up, and make everything nice and<br/>\ntidy.  But I refrained.  In the meantime, he was intently watching Michael<br/>\n(his 7 year old brother).  He saw Michael carefully clean up his area (It&#39;s<br/>\nMichael&#39;s personality to be orderly and he has always paid attention to<br/>\ndetail).  He saw Michael putting his paint lid on and looking around for<br/>\nsomething to bang it shut with.  Then George did the same thing, very<br/>\ncarefully, on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this doesn&#39;t sound like much, but what a revelation to me!  And how<br/>\nrefreshing and calming for me to not feel like I&#39;ve got to &quot;teach&quot; them how<br/>\nto do everything.  They just know.  And if they don&#39;t know, who cares?!<br/>\nThey have their own ways of doing things, and it doesn&#39;t have to be like my<br/>\nway.  A lot of times their ways are better!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the garden boxes, the little boys decided it was time to give the<br/>\nchicken coop a fresh coat of paint.  What a blast!  They ran to the chicken<br/>\nhouse and glopped white paint all over it, and managed to paint a few other<br/>\nthings on the way!  We have some beautifully painted big rocks and some nice<br/>\nartwork on a tree now for memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re talking about what vegetables, flowers or herbs they want to plant<br/>\nin their boxes.  Again, it&#39;s difficult for me to let them choose on their<br/>\nown.  The test will come when they&#39;re planting them, IF they decide to, and<br/>\nme not directing them unless they ask for help.  You know, another side<br/>\nbenefit is that the little one, George, is quickly learning how to ask for<br/>\nhelp if he wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also beautiful to see them expressing their little personalities,<br/>\nlikes and dislikes.  In the setting we were in before, as I shared in one of<br/>\nmy first posts, it was very controlling, and I felt the children repressed<br/>\ntheir individuality while attending the little &quot;Amish&quot; school there.<br/>\nThey&#39;re once again blossoming and I feel like doing the Snoopy dance, with<br/>\nmy arms outstretched, my head up, and spinning around.  It&#39;s just delightful<br/>\nto discover with them and to let them be free!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a quote from the John Holt book that stuck with me and is so true.<br/>\nI can&#39;t seem to find it in the book right now, but the idea is this,<br/>\n&quot;Intelligence is not measured by how much we know how to do, it&#39;s how we<br/>\nbehave when we don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;  (I&#39;m paraphrashing, as I&#39;m sure he<br/>\nsays it much clearer.  Isn&#39;t that a great one? That I may I apply that to<br/>\nmyself and in the way I interact with the children, is my desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m enjoying this list, and gleaning a lot from the posts and links to<br/>\narticles. I&#39;m amazed at how far off we strayed from our natural learning way<br/>\nof life th past couple of years, and am so grateful to be getting back on<br/>\nthe right track for our family.
