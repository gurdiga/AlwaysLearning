A friend of mine argues that kids need to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; able to work through situations. She is especially referring to my<br/>\n&gt; kid, who is highly sensitive and not &quot;easy going&quot; like her kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids are soooo different, I almost had to reinvent how I parent.<br/>\nWhat one child needs for distractions or working through tough<br/>\nmoments is so totally different than the other child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older,13yo, daughter has her own techniques of working through her<br/>\nfrustrations.  I have no idea how it works in her own head, she&#39;s<br/>\nnever been able to articulate it to me.  I do know, that the less I<br/>\ndo, the better the situation is.<br/>\n<br/>\nA simple acceptance on my part of what she&#39;s going through, maybe a<br/>\nsuggestion or two, is about all I do, just something to let her know<br/>\nthat I&#39;m on her side and available to help her if she so chooses my<br/>\nhelp.  Anything else is going to feel intrusive to her and cause her<br/>\nfrustration.  On the surface it may look like I&#39;m doing nothing, yet<br/>\nI&#39;m totally tuned in to her in her time of need and I monitor the<br/>\nsituation from afar.  I do what I can, like keep her little sister<br/>\noccupied and out of her space, find a cool song for her, make her a<br/>\nnice little snack, bring her a drink, whatever seems appropriate.<br/>\nFor me, it&#39;s like bringing light and hope into her life in a time<br/>\nthat for her it appears somewhat dim.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other daughter, 6, NEEDS very involved physical distraction.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot just her age, but her personality.  I have to be very proactive<br/>\nin the whole situation.  Dropping the ball, on my part, could mean<br/>\nprolonged agony for all parties involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading on Sandra&#39;s site about how it takes more time when<br/>\nthe kids are younger <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto\">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto\">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a>&gt;  , and progressively<br/>\nless time or ratio of mom/kid time as the child gets older.  I find<br/>\nthis is definitely true for my relationship with my younger<br/>\ndaughter.  As she&#39;s gotten older, she can handle more and better,<br/>\nsituations that frustrate her, on her own, with less and less help<br/>\nfrom me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Distraction","postDate":"1205259412","msgId":32948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDQjc5OUYzLUZFN0UtNDg3Ny1BREI5LTY1Mzk5OTRFQjg4OEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyNjA3YytmNHAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZyNjA3YytmNHAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32939,"nextInTopic":32949,"prevInTime":32947,"nextInTime":32949,"topicId":32881,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It was reading an article about Howard Gardner s Multiple Intelligence Theory that gave me the name of my newsletter. :)-=- I figured!

The biggest thing I  have done <br/>\nto improve my relationship with my family since our years of  unschooling <br/>\nbegan is to just keep my mouth shut.  Seriously,  we truly  have wonderful <br/>\nrelationships but there still are many days when something  surfaces that I choose <br/>\nto deal with by not saying anything.  It works time  and time again.  It works <br/>\nso well that it&#39;s my first choice in any  situation when I feel the slightest <br/>\nbit annoyed by something or feeling  stressed.  I can&#39;t think of any time that <br/>\nmy saying something when I was  stressed has ever been beneficial.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis week we have relatives visiting from out of state and I got home from  a <br/>\nfew hours of work this morning with 2 kids asleep and one reading the  paper <br/>\non the couch.  Dishes from last night in the sink, laundry piled up  to fold, <br/>\nplans to take the relatives to the beach, the dog needed to be fed and  for <br/>\nsome reason I just really wanted to have all the leaves blown off the front  <br/>\nporch and walkway before the relatives arrived.  My issues,  really.  Everyone <br/>\nwas happy and I was so close to saying something that  would have ruined <br/>\neveryone&#39;s day, including mine.  However, I made the  choice to go outside and clean <br/>\noff the leaves and enjoy the beautiful day for  awhile rather than spewing out <br/>\nsomething unpleasant.  A few minutes later,  the leaves were gone and I <br/>\nwalked back in to find 3 happy kids not at all aware  of any problems that I was <br/>\nhaving.  We had the most lovely day because I  took the time to breathe a bit <br/>\nand distance myself from a situation that really  was not worth being upset <br/>\nabout.<br/>\n <br/>\nTonight, the kids folded the clothes to make some room to play the new  Super <br/>\nSmash Bros. Brawl that we bought while we were out, we ordered pizza and  <br/>\nsomeone has cleaned the kitchen.  Truly amazing..&lt;g&gt; I can guarantee  that if I <br/>\nhad said something earlier that our day would not have been anywhere  near so <br/>\nfun.<br/>\n <br/>\nYears of practice doing this has made it second nature.  If I&#39;m  bothered by <br/>\nsomething it is almost always something that I need to deal  with.  Not <br/>\nsomething that anyone else is doing.  I&#39;m either tired,  hungry, or need to lighten <br/>\nup a bit.  Years of helping them become aware of  how to deal with hunger, <br/>\ntiredness and just general life stuff has led to a  home of children who are most <br/>\noften happy and a mom who knows how to slip  outside for awhile and come back <br/>\nto happy.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/\">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************It&#39;s Tax Time!

I&#39;ve  <br/>\nseen him teach beginning karate lessons.  I&#39;ve seen him demonstrate  <br/>\ngames (as have some who were at the HSC conference when he did  <br/>\ngaming).

My response, and some  <br/>\nexpansion:<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not a bad thing to distract an angry child.  My children are  <br/>\ngood evidence of that.  Their relationships are good evidence of  <br/>\nthat.  Those people who, over the years, have assured whole lists  <br/>\nthat I was wrong and manipulative, where are their children?  Do  <br/>\npeople even remember who they were?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was nine, I was just about the only person writing about  <br/>\nunschooling online, and I got some criticism, and someone said &quot;You  <br/>\ncan ignore her; her oldest child is nine.&quot;  I didn&#39;t defend myself  <br/>\nthen with details of having had custody of three relatives before  <br/>\n(from two different families), nor of having taught Jr. High for  <br/>\nyears, nor of having been very analytical about how much of my own  <br/>\nlearning happened outside of school, or inside school but outside  <br/>\ntheir plans for my learning.  I just sucked it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is important:  I was telling stories about what was working  <br/>\nwith Kirby and Marty.  I was sharing personal successes.  I was  <br/>\nreminding people what John Holt had discovered in his observations  <br/>\n(or telling them for the first time usually).  I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;I  <br/>\nknow it all.&quot;  My kids all agreed early, and continue to support, my  <br/>\nsharing their lives in enough detail that others can see how it can  <br/>\nwork in the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still distract them when they&#39;re frustrated, and they&#39;re  <br/>\npractically grown (or grown) at 16, 19 and 21.  If Holly is wound up  <br/>\ntightly and is about to say or do something regrettable, I&#39;ll ask her  <br/>\nto come and help me carry laundry, or unload the dishwasher (WITH me,  <br/>\nnot by herself), and I get her away from other people and she can  <br/>\nvent a bit, and I remind her of something good and right about the  <br/>\nsituation, or remind her she has the power to make it better or  <br/>\nworse, and that&#39;s about all the reminding she needs now.    This is  <br/>\nbuilt on years of other such incidents when she needed more  <br/>\naggressive saving from herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child is furious or violent, it hurts him too.  When a child  <br/>\nhits, it makes him a child who hits.  Parents shouldn&#39;t partner up  <br/>\nwith that, but should support their child&#39;s being a thoughtful,  <br/>\naware, careful person.  If it&#39;s too soon for the child to be  <br/>\nthoughtful or careful, then the parent can prevent him from doing  <br/>\ndamage by getting him out and involved with something else while he&#39;s  <br/>\ncalming down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32894,"nextTopicId":32951}}
