It was one of the most profoundly moving books I&#39;ve  <br/>\never read, the truest account of how I remember my best learning  <br/>\nexperiences as a child and an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt was a dedicated teacher and a very, very keen observer of  <br/>\nchildren from babyhood up. Most of How Children Learn takes the form  <br/>\nof notes from his diaries, his later reflections on his failures and  <br/>\nsuccesses, and letters and feedback from other parents and educators.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt&#39;s basic thesis is that kids want to learn, are natural learners,  <br/>\nand will learn more if we recognize that and let them explore their  <br/>\nworlds, acting as respectful co-learners instead of bosses....<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38291,"nextTopicId":38615}}
