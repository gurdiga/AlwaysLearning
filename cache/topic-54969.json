But they <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be learned in structured group activities. That is not the <br/>\nonly option.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin a family there is going to have to be give and take if <br/>\neverybody&#39;s interests and needs are going to be honored. Being part of a <br/>\nfamily IS being part of a group activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent thinks a kid isn&#39;t getting a good sense of how to behave in <br/>\na group, maybe they just aren&#39;t getting out much? Every time we go to <br/>\nthe movies, for example, my kids were learning to be considerate to <br/>\nothers (either by me coaching them or by the rude examples of others). <br/>\nWe often did little one-time things - like sitting and watching a demo <br/>\nat a science museum. They even learned to raise their hands when they <br/>\nwanted to respond to a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, unschooled kids are far more likely to question <br/>\nauthority and to assume something is okay for them to do and to just <br/>\nstop doing something if they aren&#39;t interested in continuing it.  This <br/>\ncan come across as undisciplined to people who expect kids to be quite <br/>\nobedient and unquestioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in what Vidyut&#39;s husband thought - I agree that I&#39;ve seem <br/>\nsome of that, too, where it seems like the parents are overly <br/>\nuncomfortable with their kids having a hard time with something. To <br/>\nconstantly ask if a kid wants to stop or if they need help or does that <br/>\nhurt or is this too hard, etc., seems like it has to be undermining to a <br/>\nkid&#39;s confidence. I&#39;ve seen parents remind a kid three or four times <br/>\nwithin in an hour, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do this if you don&#39;t want to.&quot; <br/>\nThis happens when they see their kid struggling or feeling frustrated, <br/>\nbut I&#39;ve seen parents anticipate that before it has actually happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most unschooled kids probably know they don&#39;t have to do it. The <br/>\nparents are reacting to their own experience as a child who knew they <br/>\nDID have to do whatever they were given to do. Again, no hard and fast <br/>\nrule. I can imagine a child who might feel pressured and need to hear <br/>\nthat it was okay to stop, but I agree with Vidyut and her husband that <br/>\nkids also need some support for sticking to something, too, not <br/>\ntoo-quick encouragement to give up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we did do group activities - storytime at the library, tours <br/>\nwith our homeschooling group - that weren&#39;t ongoing commitments and we <br/>\ncould just leave if things weren&#39;t working out well.

The first time or second time we met, the black flies were biting and ds (8 yrs) decided he would go inside (we had bug nets, but no repellent on).  While I made a trip to the car with my toddler, one of the leaders told him everyone inside that they had to go outside.  My son went along with this, but was upset.  He did not talk to her about it and didn&#39;t tell me until the program was over.  Later he said that he didn&#39;t want to go back for the next meeting because he was afraid that he would be told he would have to go outside.  I talked to him about different ideas in case he still might come (some of the range of ideas were: stay at Daddy&#39;s work while the rest of us go, participate only in inside activities, not go at all, go after black fly season, wear bug repellent and long pants and sleeves and a bug net, etc).  I also called the leaders ahead of time to explain that he didn&#39;t want to participate in the outside part at all if he felt uncomfortable about the bugs and asked if it was okay if he came and only participated in the inside parts of the program.  I thought I should ask them for permission since  what he might want to do might differ from what was expected and anticipated and also I wouldn&#39;t want my son to influence others to stay inside if the group is doing outside activities.  Turned out that the leaders were understanding.  When it came time to do some outdoor activities, they asked him if he wanted to do specific things, but didn&#39;t push it.  Li seemed comfortable with this too.  He did opt to do some things outside and thankfully the bugs were much less bothersome.

For example, a child finding a new activity difficult will likely<br/>\nbe scared to attempt it. One possibility is to cue in to that fear and offer<br/>\nwithdrawal. Another is to change the activity to eliminate the fear<br/>\n*changing the very nature of what is being attempted*. What seemed natural<br/>\nand empowering (also commonly done in camps) to both of us, but we didn&#39;t<br/>\nsee playing out was to remain aware of the fear, offer support and encourage<br/>\ntrying out to whatever level the child could attempt without getting<br/>\nexcessively scared/overwhelmed. In our experience, it is a common factor of<br/>\nstretching boundaries - becoming aware of the uncertainty of the desired new<br/>\nexperience and learning to adapt. I think it is a valuable learning for life<br/>\nwhether it is about rules or adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found that making the least discomfort significant and offering immediate<br/>\nchoices (without knowing what the experience would feel like) seemed to<br/>\nlessen the child&#39;s tolerance for the unfamiliarity.

There have been any number of times I&#39;ve gone with Mo or Ray to some class or group ready to pack up and go at a moment&#39;s notice if she or he wasn&#39;t comfortable with the experience - because with either of them &quot;uncomfortable&quot; could become &quot;meltdown&quot; and that wouldn&#39;t be fun for anyone involved. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust this past weekend I brought Mo (8) to a yoga class with me, ready to leave if she wasn&#39;t comfortable with the situation. Of course, knowing my kid as I do, I also did a whole lot of prep-work: packed a bag with a dozen other things for her to do, brought a set of special yoga props and cards, and checked in with the teacher. That kind of proactivity is a good idea if you know in advance that your kid tends to have difficulties in group or class situations. It lets you have more options than &quot;break the rules or leave&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I also don&#39;t really use the sort of continual checking-in process that Vidyut describes - I stay focused on my kid in the moment if the situation seems to call for that, and maybe that&#39;s a key difference. I don&#39;t *have to* check in because I&#39;m right there, seeing the interest or withdrawal or discomfort and ready to offer another option before things get to the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; point, without making a big deal about it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Boy Scouts, following intstructions, taking  direction","postDate":"1276643882","msgId":54979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2MzgyMy4yMzgyMy5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluM21BaHF5Tk0yQmZiODZ3U2k2alY3U2I1Wm5acXZBLWJUN3dwT0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGh2ODNyaytjMXBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWt0WDFTWXlsUU93YTJYa3RBcC1ISGFyNzdqaGszS3FFVWJVQk1WQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MTA1MjE0RUMtM0FEQy00ODkwLUIxNzAtNDU2M0FCRDBFQTM2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW4zbUFocXlOTTJCZmI4NndTaTZqVjdTYjVablpxdkEtYlQ3d3BPQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54978,"nextInTopic":54982,"prevInTime":54978,"nextInTime":54981,"topicId":54969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If my kids want to go the the pool at the Athletic  Club ( where we are members) one of  the rules is no running around the pool.

Visiting people, hobby classes,<br/>\nscouts, camps, jobs, family, friends.... It is part of being functional in<br/>\nany group to be able to adapt to its conditions if necessary. It seems,<br/>\nsigning on for something defines the &#39;necessary&#39; for my husband. He feels<br/>\nstrongly that it is important the child learn to &#39;go with the flow&#39; unless<br/>\nthe circumstances are somehow invasive or impossible. I see this as a give<br/>\nand take. Negotiations can happen. Also the &#39;learning to go with the flow&#39;<br/>\nneed not happen right now, or at every instance there is a conflict. But, as<br/>\na larger pattern, sure, I think its important that there are increasing<br/>\ninstances of attempting to adapt if the desire to belong exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see as much of an issue as he did, but I do share his observation<br/>\nthat there was constant attention and inquiries as to comfort, which<br/>\nprobably magnified the smallest discomfort by verbalizing it and fixing a<br/>\n&#39;position&#39; on it at first awareness. Perhaps we are more used to stretching<br/>\nboundaries, but it seems to me that any new experience involves moving out<br/>\nof the familiar and it is likely not going to help the learning process if<br/>\nsupport entails either withdrawal, breaking norms or leaving to own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy impression now is that living in an environment with very few rules, the<br/>\nchildren genuinely had no clue how to cope with rules imposed by people they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t already know well enough. It wasn&#39;t so much as they didn&#39;t want, as<br/>\nit was a whole new array of considerations beyond what they were used to.<br/>\nThe support they got was in terms of checking on their comfort and offering<br/>\noptions of not doing the activity or persuading the instructors to let them<br/>\ndo what they wanted. I think of it now, but it didn&#39;t occur to me then. They<br/>\nliterally had no previous experience of being responsible for their actions<br/>\nin an environment that deemed some of them appropriate and others not. It<br/>\nwould have helped if we could have supported them through the process of<br/>\nworking out the importance/significance of them, or even if we could simply<br/>\nhave provided encouragement and caring that made stretching boundaries like<br/>\nthat easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough honestly,it didn&#39;t seem like the end of the world to me. Some<br/>\nopportunities are more suited to adaptation than others *shrug*. This wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe only one. There were likely many opportunities closer to their comfort<br/>\nzone if the lives of the kids were seen as a continuity than a snapshot in a<br/>\ncamp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how it goes with parents unfamiliar with the challenge of the<br/>\nunfamiliar (yikes! talk of convoluted), but a possibility seemed that there<br/>\ncould be ways to discover how to learn to find new balances in changed<br/>\nenvironments. Of course, its easy for me to see possibilities when I neither<br/>\nconducted the activities nor participated in them. Perhaps, in the<br/>\nsituation, I might have made many choices that seemed excessively safe to<br/>\nthe point of closing off new experience. I don&#39;t know, but this is very<br/>\nalive in me right now, as a parent, member of a community and as an<br/>\nexperiential learning facilitator.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I wanted to edit this post shorter, but N wants attention, and I know I<br/>\nwill never send it out if I save it for later.

He is not completely unrulely but in many situations where there is a definate leader and where there are rules to follow he will respond rather reluctantly or defiantly.  He seemed to be enjoying Boy Scouts for the most part until one day when we were at a park where the activities were very structured. The kids couldn&#39;t do this until they explained this, you could not ride around freely on your bike, had to wear shoes, etc.  He got put off because he thought he should be able to play when he wanted and did not enjoy being told what to do.  This particular troop was through a Catholic Church and most of the boys go to the catholic school. They all seem to fall in line when needed.  (I was hoping others coul also talk about their scouting experiences and how it related to unschooling.)  He can sometimes argue points that he is very obviously wrong on and get very excited about it.  I think there was a tread recently that addressed that. I guess when he finds something that he definately wants to be part of he will follow the rules?  I guess it is better not to give him too many directions and let him just watch and learn on his own terms?  I still have conflict with in myself reguarding the more Christian, follow the higher power, hierachy way of doing things and what I get from unschooling. <br/>\nJoanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55110,"nextTopicId":55074}}
