I have to say that I am amazed at the change in my family over these past two weeks. Nakiah&#39;s language has exploded. She&#39;s asking more and more questions and I feel so much closer to her. I have always had a hard time connecting with her since birth. As she grew older I started to see her as I thought she should be, not for who she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always thought we were engaging the girls, and we were, but not in this way. We&#39;ve always been relaxed about food and bedtimes. We eat at the table sometimes, and sometimes we all sit in front of the TV. To us it&#39;s about being with the family not so much where.<br/>\nWe have a routine we do at bedtime, bath, books and then the girls would go to sleep. <br/>\nOver the past two weeks I&#39;ve noticed they come to us and tell us when they are ready for bath and bed, lol<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been saying yes more and it actually feels good! <br/>\nThere are tough times too. I know it&#39;s only the beginning. I&#39;m hard on myself and have a habit of comparing myself to others. I appreciate the discussion on that.<br/>\nNakiah asked to go to school last week. I posted about it on the Radical Network and appreciate all of the responses I&#39;ve received on that topic.<br/>\nShe says she&#39;s having fun at home and she likes me being the teacher.<br/>\nI never told her I was the teacher. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad told me last night(he lives with us) that he has noticed a change in the household and especially the girls. He&#39;s impressed and told me that if he had known of this option when me and my brother were in school, he would&#39;ve pulled us out and done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to watching our life unfold.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarcel<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.luvnharmony.wordpress.com\">http://www.luvnharmony.wordpress.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44893,"nextTopicId":44964}}
