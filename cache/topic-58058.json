We realized that motion sickness could be an issue to her. We moved her car seat behind the front passenger seat and took off the head rest. (if I am not driving I sit in the back with the kids so that seat is generally not occupied. If it is occupied, it&#39;s best to keep the headrest in place.) In this position with the head rest off, she has a clear view out the front window.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEver since we made this switch she is perfectly happy in the car. I don&#39;t know if looking out the front alleviates motion sickness for her, as it does for me, or if this has just given her more visual interest and, therefore, a better ride.

As long as I could sit in the backseat and let her nurse, it wasn&#39;t a big deal.

It gets better, if that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh...we brought the carseat into the house for a few weeks and left it on the floor in the living room.  Being able to play all over it and integrate it into her play may have helped somewhat.

Some have really high wings around the head, which may add to her discomfort or a feeling of claustrophobia.... and maybe being a part of choosing her torture device would help with her willingness.<br/>\n<br/>\nDd (7 yrs) has an iPod now and she loves riding in the car.
