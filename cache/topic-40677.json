Both of them had really  <br/>\npretty handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first went to school I couldn&#39;t read, and I learned exactly as  <br/>\nthe teacher was teaching us, because I was ready.  There weren&#39;t many  <br/>\nbooks at my house and my mom was impatient and really liked my little  <br/>\nsister and spent a lot of time with her.  So when I got to school and  <br/>\nsaw easy books, and had some phonics lessons and some encouragement,  <br/>\nI could read.  They &quot;taught me&quot; or I learned easily, but mostly I  <br/>\nneeded clues and resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the teacher told my mom she should not have taught me to write my  <br/>\nname, because it was disruptive and the school wanted to teach me  <br/>\ntheir way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next year, when I was in second grade, my maternal grandfather  <br/>\n(Papaw, but they were both Papaw) taught me to add columns of  <br/>\nnumbers, and how to carry into the tens.  It was fun!  It was cool.   <br/>\nHe was glad to teach me, because he had gone to school less than two  <br/>\nyears, as a kid in &quot;the aughts&quot; (1906 or so probably; he was born in  <br/>\n1898, give or take a year).  So when we were still adding  <br/>\nhorizontally in school instead of stacking numbers up, I knew what  <br/>\nwas coming in math.  I liked it, but the teacher didn&#39;t like it as  <br/>\nmuch, because it meant I was bored and impatient.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was bored and impatient in school for 11 years before I went to the  <br/>\nuniversity and wasn&#39;t so bored or impatient because the material was  <br/>\nnew and the pace was fast.   Because I got good grades, though, I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t punished much for it.  I had friends who were bored and  <br/>\nimpatient and refused to do monkey tricks to make good grades.  They  <br/>\nwere in trouble.    They were called hyperactive and academically  <br/>\nbehind,  and I was called gifted and understimulated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of those experiences and all of that knowledge just made it  <br/>\neasier for me to parent and unschool confidently.

He was okay in his kindergarten <br/>\nyear although he didn&#39;t exactly enjoy it. Then the following year he <br/>\nbecame noticeably unhappy and was becoming progressively unhappier. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a ten years older sister - now a university graduate - who had <br/>\nalways excelled at school. The year he started school, she was Dux of <br/>\nthe Year at her high school. She graduated from high school the <br/>\nfollowing year in the top 1% in the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when our son reached the stage of not wanting to go to school, it <br/>\nwas very difficult for my wife and I not to believe that helping him <br/>\nadapt to school culture was the right way to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we worked on initially and, unfortunately, it only made <br/>\nthings worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d always been as involved as possible with both of my children&#39;s <br/>\nschooling and at the time I was already inside my son&#39;s school nearly <br/>\nevery day. I attended virtually every morning assembly, I was also a <br/>\nparent helper in the school&#39;s remedial reading program (though they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t call it that - non-PC apparently) two mornings a week, and I <br/>\nwas also helping out occasionally in the canteen and with classroom <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\nObserving the teaching in the classroom was like watching paint dry. <br/>\nThat was a major factor in my wife and I ultimately deciding to take <br/>\nour son out of school and to homeschool him. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, our primary concern was for our son to be happy, whatever <br/>\nthe solution needed to be, but, thinking at the time in terms of how <br/>\nhe would be educated, we could see that it made no sense for him to <br/>\nbe in a school classroom all day if he was unhappy with that when he <br/>\ncould clearly do more in less time at home. So I suppose it could be <br/>\nsaid that a desire for &#39;educational efficiency&#39; was one of the <br/>\nreasons that led us to try homeschooling as a remedy for our son&#39;s <br/>\nunhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschooling was three hours a day, based on subjects not a <br/>\ncurriculum and very informal, no having to sit at a table or anything <br/>\nlike that. Very much &quot;guide on the side&quot;, but still working to a set <br/>\ntimetable. That lasted about two weeks. My son hated it and didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do it. If he didn&#39;t want to do it, neither did I. My wife and <br/>\nI were not going to exchange one unhappy situation for another, so we <br/>\ngave our son the year off to do what he liked. What he liked was <br/>\nvideogaming, watching TV and surfing the internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur thinking was, well, he&#39;s only seven, there&#39;s plenty of time for <br/>\nhim to catch up with anything if he needs to, we&#39;ll resume the formal <br/>\neducation next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never did. Our son&#39;s lifestyle is much the same today, six years <br/>\nlater. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, while it&#39;s true that he can&#39;t recite the months of the year in <br/>\norder, that&#39;s something he can memorise in half an hour if he ever <br/>\nneeds to (otherwise just look at a calendar!), and &#39;gaps&#39; like that <br/>\nare more than compensated for by what he does know. What he knows - <br/>\nand understands - about the world he lives in and his culture and how <br/>\nsociety works is way, way, way ahead of what I knew when I was his <br/>\nage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so envious of that boy sometimes. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and he&#39;s never been left alone in his interests. Not that I&#39;m <br/>\ninvolved all the time by any means, but our days together usually <br/>\ninclude some playing videogames together, watching TV together, <br/>\ngoogling, you tubing, having interesting conversations. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re both always learning in fact. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it doesn&#39;t bother me in the least that I&#39;m an avid reader and <br/>\nalways in the process of reading at least a couple of books at a time <br/>\n(ebooks mainly these days) while he won&#39;t even touch one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s in a whole new world of &#39;education&#39;.

Those ideas of success and failure within<br/>\neducation are created by the idea that you have to succeed, get good<br/>\ngrades, but if everyone can&#39;t succeed in that environment, it inherently<br/>\ncreates failures.  Unschooling works within a different dichotomy, one<br/>\nin which everyone succeeds to their own standards because they are doing<br/>\nwhat they want to do for their individual needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is learning in video games and TV, you just have to SEE it.  You<br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to see it if you are measuring everything with school<br/>\neyes.  Remember schools don&#39;t necessarily care about learning, they<br/>\nreally care more about teaching and passing tests, which isn&#39;t a real<br/>\nmeasure of learning.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to the group and unschooling.

She  <br/>\nworks (teaches karate) and spends a lot of her earnings buying tv  <br/>\nshows on dvd.  Loving television as much as she does, plus playing a  <br/>\nlot of video games and role playing games like D&D, hasn&#39;t kept her  <br/>\nfrom also doing lots of other things - she dances and plays soccer.  <br/>\nShe just had 6 soccer games in 3 days. She&#39;s got lots of friends -  <br/>\nspent yesterday at Disneyland with a group of them. She reads a lot,  <br/>\ntoo, and listens to a lot of music.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t look at the tv/gaming as a &#39;problem&#39; that you have to pull him  <br/>\naway from. It may seem paradoxical, but if you focus on supporting his  <br/>\ntv and gaming interests and expanding on them and also offering lots  <br/>\nof other options that you think he might enjoy, he will be more likely  <br/>\nto take advantage of all those cool options you&#39;re offering.  If, on  <br/>\nthe other hand, you&#39;re focusing on pulling him away from what he loves  <br/>\n(games and tv), you will create resistance and he&#39;ll be less likely to  <br/>\ntake you up on your offers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have two nephews who are this way (they are both 8 and 9-they are  <br/>\npublic school children though,not that it makes a difference).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes a world of difference. Are their parents actively and  <br/>\nenergetically supporting their interest in games?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;They sit in their rooms and play games for hours and hours and they  <br/>\nhave been this way for months.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo their parents interact with them? Play the games a little - enough  <br/>\nto be game-literate, at least? Have conversations about the games and  <br/>\nhow its going and what the player is working on and what do they think  <br/>\nabout the design of the game? Do their parents find interesting  <br/>\ntidbits of information about the games to share with their kids? Do  <br/>\nthey look up who composed the music and find out what else that  <br/>\ncomposer wrote. Find the music for the kid to play on a keyboard or  <br/>\nother musical instrument that they might be interested in? Do they  <br/>\nsurprise their kids by putting their favorite game music all on a cd  <br/>\nor on a playlist to be put on their iPods? Do the parents look around  <br/>\nto see if there are any museums with special exhibits related to video  <br/>\ngames. Google &quot;video game museum&quot; and see what cool things there are  <br/>\nthere. Look at &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.videotopia.com/\">http://www.videotopia.com/</a>&gt;. Do their parents notice  <br/>\nwhen there are game conventions going on and plan family vacations  <br/>\naround them? (Blizzcon 2008 was in October in Southern California a  <br/>\nblock away from Disneyland - that would have made a fantastic family  <br/>\nvacation - information is not yet available about a possible Blizzcon  <br/>\n2009.) Kid loves tv? Plan a family vacation to include tv-show  <br/>\ntapings, a tour of a tv studio. We went to Manhattan in June and one  <br/>\nof the things we did was visit locations that we knew because of  <br/>\nfavorite tv shows. You can find pre-designed tours online or even take  <br/>\nspecialized bus tours based on specific tv shows. There are two  <br/>\nMuseums of Television and Radio - one in Los Angeles and on in New  <br/>\nYork City - they are really amazing places where we&#39;ve spent many  <br/>\nhappy hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I guess I do not want my child to be like that. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t you be like their parents, then.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Should I just leave my son alone and let him play video games and  <br/>\nwatch tv all the time?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. HELP him play what he wants and make it nicer for him. Take him  <br/>\nfood, help make him comfortable, buy him manuals, keep an eye out for  <br/>\nsales on games or expansion packs. Get him good gaming equipment.Get a  <br/>\nWii and play the sports games and Rock Band and others of the new  <br/>\ngames that are more active and fun for the whole family. Also, notice  <br/>\nwhat kinds of video games he likes to play. Are they strategic  <br/>\nthinking games or more physical dexterity types of games? Use that as  <br/>\na guide to other things he might enjoy. If it is the strategic  <br/>\nthinking he likes, then get other strategy games like Blockus or  <br/>\nOthello or Pente to play as a family. If it is more shoot &#39;em up  <br/>\ngames, take the family and some friends out to play laser tag. If the  <br/>\ngames he plays involve role-playing and he likes that, then maybe  <br/>\nintroduce him to D&D or other role-playing games - start a regular  <br/>\n&quot;game day&quot; with a couple of friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; How can I get him to want to do something else? He is only  9 and I  <br/>\nam not sure if it is healthy for him to zone out infront of a TV and  <br/>\nvideo games all day. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t insult him, even in your own head. &quot;Zone out&quot; is condescending  <br/>\nand degrading.

They said &quot;Please stop&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is actually not too uncommon. When I was younger, my mom spent a<br/>\nlot of time with me and I learned to read, write and do math (even<br/>\nsimple algebra) before I attended Kindergarten. It was too late for<br/>\nthem to tell her to stop teaching me, but they recommended to her that<br/>\nshe should not teach my little brother. So, she didn&#39;t help him learn<br/>\nto write his name, she didn&#39;t even say the ABCs with him.. and<br/>\nsurprise.. they complained about that, too. So, you can&#39;t really<br/>\nplease the public school system.. they will always find something to<br/>\ncomplain about.. even their own advice. But, the fact that I was<br/>\nraised to question the status quo and find answers for myself, rather<br/>\nthan rely on some person that may or may not be telling me the entire<br/>\ntruth did conflict horribly with public school and ended up with me<br/>\ndropping out in High School. Which renders me, to my family and<br/>\napparently my neighbors, completely unsatisfactory for the<br/>\nresponsibility of teaching my own child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With that being said, I have been homeschooling my child for a little<br/>\n&gt; while now and I do not feel the traditional homeschooling is working<br/>\n&gt; for him. I am afraid that I am not sure what to do anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say, to spend some time &#39;deschooling. &#39; It really helps to just<br/>\ntake &#39;time off&#39; from the schoolish way of doing things. I pulled my<br/>\nson out of school at the beginning of this school year. My head was<br/>\nswirling at the amount of useless crap he was supposed to have<br/>\nmemorized by the end of first grade. We began by doing nothing and I<br/>\nwatched as his interests unfolded. When we started &#39;doing nothing,&#39; I<br/>\nsimply kept a notebook that I would write a list of things we did<br/>\neveryday. So, I would have a record to present and to help me write<br/>\nGeorgia&#39;s required yearly progress report. Keeping the list of things<br/>\nwe did helped me realize that learning is everywhere. Just live life<br/>\nfor a while, and over time, you will recognize that he can learn just<br/>\nby being alive. If I write, &quot;We made cookies.&quot; I can easily break that<br/>\ndown into: We did math, we did reading, we did home ec. All of those<br/>\nworksheets are just busywork and prep for standardized testing, which<br/>\nwe don&#39;t do. There&#39;s a big difference between learning things and<br/>\nmemorizing things so you can get the busy work out of the way faster.<br/>\nA good example is math. My son&#39;s school-going friends are stuck in<br/>\nclass memorizing addition and subtraction facts this year and watching<br/>\nflash cards so they can easily determine how many objects are<br/>\npresented to them in less than 3 seconds. My son, on the other hand,<br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in memorizing addition and subtraction. Instead he<br/>\nskipped the memorization and decided to explore multiplication. I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever asked him to write any of it down.. he does it in his head. If I<br/>\ngave him worksheets to encourage memorization over actually grasping<br/>\nthe concept, I think it would be a disservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family is also concerned. They expect my son to be reading any<br/>\ngrade-level appropriate book they pick up and tell him to read. But,<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work that way. My son is too focused on the fruits of his<br/>\nlabor. If there are no fruits to be had, he&#39;s not interested. Reading<br/>\na book because someone else thinks he should do it, has no value to<br/>\nhim. But, reading the recipes in a cookbook while we cook has a solid,<br/>\ntangible result that he&#39;s excited about. Of course, no one thinks<br/>\nabout grabbing the cookbook and asking him to share some of his<br/>\nfavorite recipes. Why not? It&#39;s not grade-level appropriate? They<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect him to be able to do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nA book that&#39;s not exactly about unschool, but that did help me is the<br/>\nSuccessful Homeschool Family Handbook. It has a lot of information and<br/>\nadvice, ideas, etc. It did help me not to worry so much about my son<br/>\n&#39;falling behind,&#39; or &#39;not being on grade level,&#39; etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in GA.

When I was younger, my mom spent a<br/>\nlot of time with me and I learned to read, write and do math (even<br/>\nsimple algebra) before I attended Kindergarten. It was too late for<br/>\nthem to tell her to stop teaching me, but they recommended to her that<br/>\nshe should not teach my little brother. So, she didn&#39;t help him learn<br/>\nto write his name, she didn&#39;t even say the ABCs with him.. and<br/>\nsurprise.. they complained about that, too. So, you can&#39;t really<br/>\nplease the public school system.. they will always find something to<br/>\ncomplain about.. even their own advice. But, the fact that I was<br/>\nraised to question the status quo and find answers for myself, rather<br/>\nthan rely on some person that may or may not be telling me the entire<br/>\ntruth did conflict horribly with public school and ended up with me<br/>\ndropping out in High School. Which renders me, to my family and<br/>\napparently my neighbors, completely unsatisfactory for the<br/>\nresponsibility of teaching my own child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With that being said, I have been homeschooling my child for a little<br/>\n&gt; while now and I do not feel the traditional homeschooling is working<br/>\n&gt; for him.

I pulled my<br/>\nson out of school at the beginning of this school year. My head was<br/>\nswirling at the amount of useless crap he was supposed to have<br/>\nmemorized by the end of first grade. We began by doing nothing and I<br/>\nwatched as his interests unfolded. When we started &#39;doing nothing,&#39; I<br/>\nsimply kept a notebook that I would write a list of things we did<br/>\neveryday. So, I would have a record to present and to help me write<br/>\nGeorgia&#39;s required yearly progress report. Keeping the list of things<br/>\nwe did helped me realize that learning is everywhere. Just live life<br/>\nfor a while, and over time, you will recognize that he can learn just<br/>\nby being alive. If I write, &quot;We made cookies.&quot; I can easily break that<br/>\ndown into: We did math, we did reading, we did home ec. All of those<br/>\nworksheets are just busywork and prep for standardized testing, which<br/>\nwe don&#39;t do. There&#39;s a big difference between learning things and<br/>\nmemorizing things so you can get the busy work out of the way faster.<br/>\nA good example is math. My son&#39;s school-going friends are stuck in<br/>\nclass memorizing addition and subtraction facts this year and watching<br/>\nflash cards so they can easily determine how many objects are<br/>\npresented to them in less than 3 seconds. My son, on the other hand,<br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in memorizing addition and subtraction. Instead he<br/>\nskipped the memorization and decided to explore multiplication. I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever asked him to write any of it down.. he does it in his head. If I<br/>\ngave him worksheets to encourage memorization over actually grasping<br/>\nthe concept, I think it would be a disservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family is also concerned. They expect my son to be reading any<br/>\ngrade-level appropriate book they pick up and tell him to read. But,<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work that way. My son is too focused on the fruits of his<br/>\nlabor. If there are no fruits to be had, he&#39;s not interested. Reading<br/>\na book because someone else thinks he should do it, has no value to<br/>\nhim. But, reading the recipes in a cookbook while we cook has a solid,<br/>\ntangible result that he&#39;s excited about. Of course, no one thinks<br/>\nabout grabbing the cookbook and asking him to share some of his<br/>\nfavorite recipes. Why not? It&#39;s not grade-level appropriate? They<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect him to be able to do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nA book that&#39;s not exactly about unschool, but that did help me is the<br/>\nSuccessful Homeschool Family Handbook. It has a lot of information and<br/>\nadvice, ideas, etc. It did help me not to worry so much about my son<br/>\n&#39;falling behind,&#39; or &#39;not being on grade level,&#39; etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in GA.

Here is a<br/>\nlittle bit about my homeschooling/wanting to unschool family..<br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a very strict public school bloodline as does my husband.<br/>\nWe both went to public schools and we both were not satisfied with it.<br/>\nWe both made excellent grades in school but did not like the way the<br/>\nschooling system was (or still is for that matter.) We both dropped<br/>\nout of the public school system and I went on to get my diploma at<br/>\nhome.In a nutshell, I homeschooled myself so that I could graduate. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 3 children ages (9,4, and 3). Our oldest went to a public<br/>\nschool until about a year and a half ago. Before he attended school, I<br/>\ntaught him things at home. When we sent him to public school he was<br/>\nvery bored with class so he talked a lot and because of his size (he<br/>\nis little for his age) he would get bullied.I had the bully removed<br/>\nfrom his class of course but there was still that talking he was doing<br/>\nin school. He was also getting to where he was &quot;getting sick&quot; every<br/>\nmorning so he wouldn&#39;t have to go. Well to make a long story short, I<br/>\ngot pulled into class for a parent teacher conference. They asked me<br/>\nif I taught my son at home along with what he was learning at school<br/>\nand of course I said yes. They said &quot;Please stop&quot;. I just had to<br/>\nlaugh, when I asked why they said &quot;He learns enough from school<br/>\nalready and because you teach him at home too, he is bored in<br/>\nclass.Which explains the talking. Every thing we hand out he knows<br/>\nalready, so he is bored.&quot; That was the last straw and he was pulled<br/>\nout of school that day. I did not feel that my teaching at home was<br/>\nhindering him at school because I did not really &quot;teach&quot;. I just spent<br/>\ntime with him, reading, coloring, and such. I did not really look at<br/>\nit like teaching because I was doing things with him that I didn&#39;t<br/>\nremember doing in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that being said, I have been homeschooling my child for a little<br/>\nwhile now and I do not feel the traditional homeschooling is working<br/>\nfor him. I am afraid that I am not sure what to do anymore.What I mean<br/>\nis this,  because I was raised a certain way and so was my husband I<br/>\nfeel like I am not doing my part by forcing paper work on him or<br/>\nmaking him do tests and such. I am having a hard time getting this<br/>\nstructured way of schooling (that I did not like myself growing up)<br/>\nout of my system. I feel that if I do not have paper work for him to<br/>\ndo, tests for him to take, or a ton of reading to do, that I am not<br/>\ndoing a good job and therefore he will not learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nI already know that all this stuff is not working for him.There are<br/>\nendless tears, frustration and anger on both our parts and I do not<br/>\nwant this.Also I have family breathing down my neck because they feel<br/>\nthat since I am not a teacher I am not qualified and that he will be<br/>\nbehind on things that they would be teaching him in a public school. <br/>\nI pulled him out of public school because of all this frustration he<br/>\nwas getting. and now I am being the one doing it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple months back I came across the idea of unschooling. I have<br/>\nbeen studying on it A BUNCH and really feel this will work for him. I<br/>\nalready try to incorporate some into what we do and let him choose a<br/>\nlot of what he wants to learn but then I start to feel that ugly<br/>\npublic school structure poking its head out at me again.I live in a<br/>\npretty laid back state (Georgia). My only fear is that I am not doing<br/>\nenough. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days when all my son wants to do is watch TV or play video<br/>\ngames.I guess I shouldn&#39;t complain to much cause he likes to watch<br/>\nAnimal Planet, Food Network or the History Channel a lot. But again, I<br/>\nwas raised to think that too much tv can cause a child to fail and is<br/>\nnot good, and I feel terrible for letting him sometimes.I feel as if I<br/>\nshould restrict him some.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have a 4 year old. She LOVES books but does not now how to<br/>\nread. She can recognize some letters but can not seem to connect<br/>\nletters with sounds. Anyway, I was in this other homeschooling group<br/>\nand I felt really terrible that my daughter can not read yet. This<br/>\ngroup was bragging on how their 4 year old can read and mine is still<br/>\nlearning letter. I keep tons of reading material around the house and<br/>\nshe will pick up a book and make her own stories up but I was<br/>\nwondering if I should try to help her into reading or how do I go<br/>\nabout letting her do it naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh, I know I am rambling but I really love the concept of unschooling<br/>\nand feel that, with a little work, it will prove to be the best thing<br/>\nfor our family. Only thing is, I think I am the one who needs the<br/>\nwork. Can you all please help me. I need some guidance. I need help<br/>\nand understanding on unschooling. I have read websites and some of<br/>\nyour posts on here and I get some of the concepts of it but have that<br/>\nfeeling that without a ton of paperwork they will never learn. Sorry<br/>\nif this does not make sense. I know what I want to say but am having<br/>\ntrouble getting it out on here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp in Georgia, <br/>\nLeAna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40509,"nextTopicId":40787}}
