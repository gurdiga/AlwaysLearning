She said no, not  <br/>\nreally.  I gave her a light gloss, and by the time we got to the  <br/>\ncheckout stand we had decided Amelia Earhart had something in common  <br/>\nwith Elvis—both were reportedly seen alive or dead in various places  <br/>\nover a couple of decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song about Amelia Earhart wouldn&#39;t have lasted so long, either,  <br/>\nif it didn&#39;t include the great line &quot;in shark-infested waters her  <br/>\nplane went down that night  / in the blue Pacific to her  watery  <br/>\ngrave.&quot;  Any excuse to sing &quot;shark infested waters.&quot;  And the harmony  <br/>\nis good on the chorus too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll sing it at the conference in Albuquerque this fall, and  <br/>\nfor those in whom any part of the song sticks, there&#39;s an Amelia  <br/>\nEarhart hook to hang things on for all time (or a while, anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song about The Titanic is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] FW: Chicago Tribune Article on Unschooling in Today&#39;s Issue","postDate":"1142231591","msgId":24702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyQTY3MzE4LTkxRkItNDNDMi1BREI0LTAyNTg4M0Q3NjEwRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFNTZDN0EzLTg5ODItNDhEMC1CRUI3LTNGNEY0NjYwMUVEQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzEyMjI1OTM5Ljg2Nzc2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxODEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDdFNTZDN0EzLTg5ODItNDhEMC1CRUI3LTNGNEY0NjYwMUVEQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24701,"nextInTopic":24703,"prevInTime":24701,"nextInTime":24703,"topicId":24698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m sorry, but a big &quot;WHATever&quot; is welling up in me.  There is  <br/>\njust nothing that makes the stories of Amelia Earhart or Harriet  <br/>\nTubman more important than any other single American with a biography  <br/>\nworth knowing.  Neither was the only one in her field.  They&#39;ve just  <br/>\nbeen tagged as icons, and the school system wants to touch all the  <br/>\nicons.   And &quot;during THE year&quot;?  as though they&#39;re both &quot;studied  <br/>\nthoroughly&quot; every year (or ANY year).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is just the chit-chat of nonsense:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;Teachers -- and parents -- have to keep in mind that children&#39;s  <br/>\ndecision-making skills are not yet fully developed. They don&#39;t quite  <br/>\nunderstand cause-and-effect and often don&#39;t realize the consequences  <br/>\nthey may face as a result of their decisions.&quot;-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT decision!?  The &quot;decision&quot; not to &quot;study thoroughly&quot; Amelia  <br/>\nEarhart?    It&#39;s not too late!  If they hear her name and know who  <br/>\nshe is, fine.  If they hear her name and don&#39;t have any idea, maybe  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll wonder, and in finding out who she is, they will learn about  <br/>\nher.  Sheeesh...  My kids might know about her because of the ballad  <br/>\nwhich they probably heard me sing with my friend Dave a time or three  <br/>\nwhen they were little, and if they don&#39;t, that&#39;s fine.  If they asked  <br/>\nme who she was I&#39;d sing some or all of that four verse song, and tell  <br/>\nthem to google for photos.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great article.  If only they had let one of us do a final pass  <br/>\nbefore the published!  I could have said &quot;ARE, not &#39;could be,&#39; is  <br/>\nwhat he said&quot; about this:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Most trace the origins of unschooling to an approach devised by  <br/>\neducator John Holt in the 1970s.
