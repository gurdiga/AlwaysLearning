It doesn’t feel like euphoria to me it feels like awe.  Colors seem prettier, food tastes better, flowers are more fragrant, snow is more sparkly, and I find everything sort of magical, and wonderful.  Everything is beautiful or funny or sweet.  Sometimes it can feel more like a delighted mania, but usually it’s that physical, bubbling up feeling of awe. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid was the first to notice that this happens to me before a migraine.  I’ve had migraines since I was eleven-ish and I hadn’t made the connection. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to curing a headache, my first attempt at remedy for an ordinary headache is often a walk, out of town, where I’m more likely to see and think something new. I’m lucky to live where “out of town” is three blocks away. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was younger we would often go find something new and interesting to look at if he was restless or out of sorts.

Across three different  <br/>\nexperiments, they found that jaw-dropping moments made participants  <br/>\nfeel like they had more time available and made them more patient,  <br/>\nless materialistic, and more willing to volunteer time to help others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers found that the effects that awe has on decision-making  <br/>\nand well-being can be explained by awe’s ability to actually change  <br/>\nour subjective experience of time by slowing it down. Experiences of  <br/>\nawe help to brings us into the present moment which, in turn, adjusts  <br/>\nour perception of time, influences our decisions, and makes life feel  <br/>\nmore satisfying than it would otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that’s awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe study, “Awe Expands People’s Perception of Time, Alters Decision  <br/>\nMaking, and Enhances Well-Being,” will be published in Psychological  <br/>\nScience, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68300,"nextTopicId":68343}}
