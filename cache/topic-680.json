I lived right up the road <br/>\nfrom his family, attended workshops by his Dad and am well aware of what the <br/>\n&quot;courtship&quot; ritual is all about.<br/>\nIt is like an arranged marriage in my view. But most of the parents promoting <br/>\nthis will not agree with my view. The family I knew very well that did this, <br/>\nhad a dd at the age of 16 that expressed an interest in a young man (also 16) <br/>\nthat she&#39;d known her entire life. Suddenly he seemed very attractive to <br/>\nher...at this point the parents make sure it is understood that if you will <br/>\nbe spending time with this person you&#39;d best know that they will be a <br/>\nlifelong mate. Of course they go to the same church....<br/>\nWhen both kids agree that this person is someone they&#39;d consider entering <br/>\ninto a &quot;courtship&quot; with, they then spend time together under the watchful <br/>\neyes of the parents. Both parents enter into an agreement with the kids to <br/>\nhelp keep them &quot;pure&quot;.<br/>\nI saw this method become VERY invasive as factions on both sides of this <br/>\narrangement made sure these kids were never, ever alone together.<br/>\nApparently humans have zero self control when with the opposite sex.<br/>\nThey just got married in August after four years of courtship. Personally, I <br/>\nthought that the length of engagement and the parental control were <br/>\nridiculous.<br/>\nWas this an arranged marriage?<br/>\nEveryone involved will say no.<br/>\nI say yes.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":665,"nextTopicId":713}}
