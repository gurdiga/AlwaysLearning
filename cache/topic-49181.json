I don&#39;t see that it is <br/>\nalways OK. I think that patent laws, privacy laws and copyright laws are in <br/>\nplace partly to make clear the point at which information gathering becomes <br/>\nillegal such as industrial espionage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of international spying, I think the mitigating factor is the <br/>\nassumption of malevolent intent, or the possibility of malevolent intent, on <br/>\nthe part of the other country&#39;s government. I suppose therefore it falls <br/>\nunder the rubrick of &quot;self-defense&quot;. I don&#39;t think the assumption that the <br/>\nlocal store or the hotel intends to harm its customers is at all reasonable. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all a bit muddy, and could at least make for some cool conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it becomes even muddier when the issue is self preservation on a <br/>\npersonal scale. Many of the original European settlers in Australia, <br/>\nconvicts of the First and Second fleets, were transported because they were <br/>\nconvicted of poverty driven minor self preservation crimes like stealing <br/>\nloaves of bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone ever said that being an unschooling parent conferred an <br/>\nability to know all the answers. Perhaps we inherently have a greater <br/>\ninterest in tangling with knotty questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
