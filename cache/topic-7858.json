I was thinking of my wonderful creative writing<br/>\nteachers in college, who did so much encouragement, to everyone.  We all<br/>\nleft every class thinking we were talented.   So I was thinking--it&#39;s a<br/>\ngood thing something like this never happened to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I remembered. My 10th grade creative writing/English teacher,<br/>\nMrs. Sleeter (my nickname was very much rude), told me that I should<br/>\ngive up my dream of ever being a writer, that I would never ever get<br/>\nanything published, that I just simply had no talent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more reason to keep my children out of school.
