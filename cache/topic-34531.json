So we talked about the different ways they learn, how<br/>\nmuch they already know and how much of it came from schoolwork vs. life.  It<br/>\nhelps that I was homeschooled, and was left alone educationally after about<br/>\n12.  I did not do¹ jr. high or high school, just went to college.  It makes<br/>\nit easier for me (and my husband) that my kids are 8 and 13 and already know<br/>\nthe basics¹.  Not that I¹m glad it happened that way but it does make it an<br/>\neasier argument.  Fortunately, they still love learning other than my 13<br/>\ny.o. did develop a dislike of math that will hopefully dissipate! Poor guy<br/>\nwas pushing (being pushed) through algebra when I suddenly realized, why the<br/>\nhell does a 13 year old need to know algebra?  I learned it in college, and<br/>\nonly used it because I taught it for several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids acted like it was Christmas when they heard they wouldn¹t have to<br/>\ndo schoolwork and have remained very happy and satisfied with that choice.<br/>\nWe are definitely still in the deschooling process.  My 8 year old, having<br/>\nexperienced far less school than my 13 year old, is much farther along.  My<br/>\n13 year old, although he loves to read and reads tons of fiction and<br/>\nnon-fiction, as well as being online, playing lots of games, etc., he seems<br/>\nto still be suspicious of things that I offer sometimes, assuming I am<br/>\ntrying to trick him into doing schoolwork somehow lol.  I try to really make<br/>\nsure things I offer him right now are very lighthearted, such as getting the<br/>\nGarfield comics he likes from the library and nothing else (for him).  My 8<br/>\ny.o. loves it when I bring him books/videos on science (his passion), but my<br/>\n13 yo would view it with suspicion still.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I have noticed the biggest changes in the demeanor of the<br/>\n13 yo, a definite lightness and joy that were dissipating a few short months<br/>\nago.  I was actually starting to worry about depression; it runs in the<br/>\nfamily!  But by releasing my last vestiges of control (I really didn¹t think<br/>\nI had many, we were quite the laid back family anyway!) I can see that he is<br/>\nas peaceful and satisfied as anybody could hope to be!  It is so strange<br/>\nthat merely dropping two hours worth of schoolwork creates such a difference<br/>\nin how he feels he can spend his time.  Before, he would sleep in and stay<br/>\nin bed as long as possible, and then drag the schoolwork out until<br/>\nafternoon.  When it was finally over with, he would spend as much time as<br/>\npossible playing games, and not want to go anywhere that would cut into his<br/>\ngame time.  Now he gets up quite a bit earlier, plays as soon as he feels<br/>\nlike it, reads when he feels like it, watches tv when he feels like it, and<br/>\nhas picked up the guitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never expected him to play an instrument because, although we are a<br/>\nmusical family and I thought he would be good at it, I figured he would<br/>\nnever be interested in putting in the time that it takes.  In January we<br/>\nfound a music teacher that came weekly for lessons (drums for one, guitar<br/>\nfor one and bass for one).  The kids wanted the lessons.  I did not make<br/>\nthem practice, and they didn¹t practice much at all.  Suddenly, when the<br/>\nschoolwork stopped, my 13 yo (who had been having bass lessons) picked up<br/>\nthe guitar and started playing it, sometimes for hours every day!  This has<br/>\ncontinued for about 4 weeks now and he is becoming quite good.  He plays a<br/>\nlot of the songs they know from Guitar Hero and Rock Band ­ on a whole<br/>\nnother topic, it¹s amazing the interest in music those games have sparked<br/>\naround here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the looooong response, but in answer to your question about<br/>\nexperience with previously schooled kids... Living in a world where school<br/>\nis the default for kids, and especially having one still in school (which I<br/>\ndo too!) I think it is important to talk about the choices you are making,<br/>\nand especially about why they are the best choices.  I think it can seem to<br/>\nkids like you just don¹t care or are too involved with other things if you<br/>\njust don¹t have them do any schoolwork without discussing it.  I know that¹s<br/>\nhow I felt about my parents (though it was probably true in that case; I<br/>\ndon¹t think they were consciously unschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/27/08 7:57 PM, &quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lylaw@...\">lylaw@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yes, thanks for the reminder.  i think deschooling is a big part of<br/>\n&gt; it, as are all the other factors you mentioned.  things change so<br/>\n&gt; rapidly around here, that i fully imagine that he will be in a<br/>\n&gt; different place each day, week, month, in terms of his concerns,<br/>\n&gt; expectations, etc. of *himself*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i was just curious what others had experienced with previously<br/>\n&gt; schooled kids, when you began unschooling, regarding the actual<br/>\n&gt; discussion of the approach of unschooling with them, vs just *doing*<br/>\n&gt; it.  it seems in some ways that discussing it at all normalizes<br/>\n&gt; school, to some degree, and keeps things in that paradigm.  but<br/>\n&gt; perhaps in this culture of school, *not* discussing the paradigm shift<br/>\n&gt; also maintains the &quot;dominant paradigm.&quot; just grappling with those<br/>\n&gt; questions, and wondering what others may have noticed with slightly<br/>\n&gt; older kids who have the experience of school as being something that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &quot;done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks again for the reminders about deschooling, though - very<br/>\n&gt; pertinent, for sure!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyla  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , &quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems to me that part of the solution might be found in<br/>\n&gt; deschooling.

It will take some <br/>\ntime, even coming from a free school (and taking into account the fact that his sister is <br/>\nstill in school) to move away from the thinking of how learning needs to look.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s asking about unschooling, then having him read about it is a great idea, but if he&#39;s <br/>\nnot, then just concentrating on looking for the activities that he&#39;s excited about and filling <br/>\nhis days with interesting stuff will start to fill him with new energy.  In other words, just <br/>\ndoing it.  As he starts to really just live his life, one of two things may happen:  1.  He will<br/>\nstart focusing on other stuff and stop worrying about the nuts and bolts, or 2.  He will <br/>\nstart to have his own experiences with unschooling--making connections, delving deeply <br/>\ninto an interest that may lead to another interest, meeting people interested in the stuff <br/>\nhe is and having great conversations about his interests, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, even if the worries are still there he will be living his life, and eventually <br/>\nthe connections can be made and the worries replaced.  At this point, with things so new, <br/>\nhe has no experiences to back up your confidence, and having him read a bunch of theory <br/>\nmay not help, because he&#39;s still operating at a concrete level where actions speak louder <br/>\nthan words.  I suspect his worries may stem from having it not really work out for him at <br/>\nthe free school.  Maybe his rhythm of learning really didn&#39;t fit there, but at home, you&#39;ll be <br/>\nable to really support him.  A free school--as great as some people find them--still <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a deeply connected parent partner.  I&#39;m just guessing here, but maybe it&#39;s too <br/>\noverwhelming to some younger children to be put in a situation, without parents, where <br/>\nself-sufficiency or self-motivation is expected and they don&#39;t feel ready for it.
