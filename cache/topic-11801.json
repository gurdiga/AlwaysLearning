Although all <br/>\nsearch participants must score above the 95th percentile on their <br/>\ngrade-level tests, some will score only the bare minimum on the SAT. <br/>\nOthers will have near-perfect results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese scores will help schools determine which students need more <br/>\nadvanced work than they may be getting in class. At least, that&#39;s <br/>\nthe idea. Talent searches work best as a compact between students, <br/>\nthe search program and the school. We will identify profound talent, <br/>\nthe programs say. Then the program and the school together will <br/>\nnurture it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut talent searches have failed to keep their promise. The SAT can <br/>\nidentify talent, but because most middle schools do nothing with <br/>\nhigh SAT scores, the promised nurturing tends to take place during <br/>\nsummer camps run by the search programs themselves. Such programs <br/>\nare lifesavers -- for those who can afford them. But until every <br/>\ndistrict has a school where the brightest are challenged in an <br/>\nenvironment with their intellectual peers, America can&#39;t claim it&#39;s <br/>\nleaving no child behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all of the talk of failing schools these days, few consider <br/>\nthat schools can shortchange their highest scorers, too. When I <br/>\nrecently asked several former talent-search participants who scored <br/>\nmore than 1,000 on the SAT what their schools did with their scores, <br/>\nmost seemed puzzled by the question. A typical response: &#39;&#39;What <br/>\ncould they do? I was already in honors math.&#39;&#39; These bright students <br/>\nexpected to be horribly bored, even in courses aimed at the top <br/>\nquarter of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir schools, flaunting honors English and maybe seventh-grade <br/>\npre-algebra, were also blasé about providing more. Stephen Shueh did <br/>\nwell enough on the SAT as a seventh-grader to be able to cover <br/>\nalgebra and geometry during a talent-search program he took the next <br/>\nsummer. He came back to eighth grade -- and went right back into <br/>\nalgebra class.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Some people may have argued more,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;But the school made <br/>\nyou jump through hoops, and there was no class past algebra in the <br/>\nmiddle school.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent-search programs have fought this attitude for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem, according to Paula Olszewski-Kubilius of Northwestern&#39;s <br/>\nCenter for Talent Development, is that &#39;&#39;it&#39;s still, unfortunately, <br/>\nviewed as something a kid does on her own.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Assouline of the Belin-Blank Center at the University of Iowa <br/>\nagrees.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Julian Stanley saw this from the beginning,&#39;&#39; she says of the <br/>\nprogram&#39;s initiator. &#39;&#39;There have been very slight changes. Now it&#39;s <br/>\nno longer phenomenally radical to take algebra in eighth grade.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that won&#39;t satisfy kids capable of more. I asked <br/>\nOlszewski-Kubilius about a hypothetical seventh-grader who scores a <br/>\n650 on the SAT math section.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;That means intellectually she&#39;s functioning at a college level and <br/>\ncollege level for a pretty bright student,&#39;&#39; she says. &#39;&#39;She&#39;s ready <br/>\nfor an accelerated course of study. She doesn&#39;t need to spend nine <br/>\nmonths doing algebra.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she probably will. And she&#39;ll spend years in middle school <br/>\nEnglish classes, even honors classes, reading young-adult books and <br/>\nwriting five-paragraph essays that bore her to tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlend this with middle school social scenes that don&#39;t value smarts <br/>\nand no wonder talent searches&#39; summer programs seem like heaven. At <br/>\nuniversities across the country, students zoom through courses such <br/>\nas geometry, computer science and literature, covering a whole <br/>\nyear&#39;s curriculum in three weeks. They revel in bouncing ideas off <br/>\nclassmates who don&#39;t think they&#39;re freaks for liking to learn. Liz <br/>\nBaker, who helped teach a drama/writing class in a program at <br/>\nStanford, says her students &#39;&#39;were like camels who find a lake in <br/>\nthe desert -- drinking up all the water they could in the short time <br/>\nthey had.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese watering spots aren&#39;t cheap. Northwestern&#39;s program, for <br/>\ninstance, costs $2,200 a session. So most of the students <br/>\nparticipating hail from the upper middle class. Kids from <br/>\nless-privileged backgrounds, who need the experience most, usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor these students&#39; sake, every school district that promises a free <br/>\nand appropriate education needs to replicate these heady <br/>\nintellectual environments -- during the school year.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Klibaner found classes at his Staten Island, N.Y., middle <br/>\nschool underwhelming. He, too, escaped his boredom for a few weeks <br/>\nin the summer with a class at Franklin & Marshall College.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because Klibaner lived in New York, he could apply to one of the <br/>\ncity&#39;s prize-winning magnet high schools -- in his case, Stuyvesant. <br/>\nStuyvesant&#39;s entrance exam, like a talent search, identifies New <br/>\nYork&#39;s brightest from a sea of high achievers. Then Stuyvesant helps <br/>\nthese students learn all they can absorb in one of the country&#39;s <br/>\nmost challenging high schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Everything changed there because I was no longer an outcast among <br/>\nthe general student body,&#39;&#39; Klibaner says. To stretch his mind while <br/>\nsurrounded by students who loved to learn, Klibaner was willing to <br/>\ntravel almost two hours daily, each way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFulfilling the promise of talent searches means every district needs <br/>\na Stuyvesant and a middle-school equivalent. Smaller districts can <br/>\ncombine to provide a critical mass of gifted students for these <br/>\nschools -- like Klibaner, the kids will travel. More isolated <br/>\ndistricts can still create magnet programs to concentrate the <br/>\nbrightest, give them teachers trained to aim two-to-three grade <br/>\nlevels higher and adjust the curriculum to challenge students who <br/>\nneed more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA dozen states fund residential gifted high schools, usually only <br/>\nfor juniors and seniors. All states should have these schools, and <br/>\nthey should serve more than just two grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese solutions aren&#39;t terribly expensive. Magnet schools cost just <br/>\na bit more for transportation, and residential schools cost no more <br/>\nthan what states spend per child on special education. Gifted <br/>\nchildren have special needs, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because some people find such programs elitist, most districts <br/>\ndo not provide them and do little with talent searches beyond <br/>\ncongratulating the high scorer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, a seventh-grader who can&#39;t read seems more of a crisis <br/>\nthan a seventh-grader whose mind is shutting down from learning <br/>\nfractions again.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, leaving no child behind doesn&#39;t require squelching those who <br/>\nwant to surge ahead. Talent searches can find these children. <br/>\nIgnoring their gifts denies them the education they deserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York-based writer Laura Vanderkam is a member of USA TODAY&#39;s <br/>\nboard of contributors.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11800,"nextTopicId":11782}}
