He goes on to say that reading and basic math skills need to be learned by a certain and that there are some things a person can&#39;t learn once they&#39;re *too old* (without specifying what age is, just that it&#39;s beyond his comfort level).<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, at some point in his life he got too old to learn proper grammar and how to proofread, because that article was a mess. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also clearly believes that radical unschooling is synonymous with unparenting.  He&#39;s fine with people practicing his version of *unschooling* (which really doesn&#39;t sound much like unschooling to me) and paints all those who call themselves radical unschoolers with a broad brush, in a very unbecoming color. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, he&#39;s of the kinds of homeschoolers (I can&#39;t call him an unschooler, because IMO, he isn&#39;t) with whom I&#39;m not crazy about discussing unschooling as a whole-life method. He seems convinced that anyone who doesn&#39;t acknowledge his *must learn at an early age* list is being irresponsible and unparenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nBob: &gt; It reminded me of something that happened to me recently on another unschooling list - a &quot;radical unschooling&quot; list - when a mother posted a request for help regarding her daughter&#39;s lack of reading ability. The daughter was almost 13 and apparently could barely read at all and was very uncomfortable with that in the company of her peers. What the mother asked was, &quot;What would you do?&quot; Since the daughter was apparently now thoroughly miserable with this ongoing situation and her mother was becoming increasingly anxious because her daughter was so miserable, it seemed to me that the real issue was happiness not reading, so I wrote that what I would do was set myself the goal of helping my daughter develop her reading ability to a sufficient degree that she would be comfortable in the company of her peers and I would respect my daughter&#39;s self-authority by finding a way to do so that she was agreeable to. I thought that was a reasonable response and it is what I would do, so I was only answering the question asked. My reply was moderated out and not published. The mother got the same advice from a number of other people, which was to wait and do nothing because the daughter would catch up to her peers with her reading eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nIt&#39;s a shame your post was moderated and unpublished, because I find that often the more ideas posted, the more helpful the discussion that results will be. One of the things I like most about this list is the variety of advice and ideas offered, and the conversations that follow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that particular situation, my first suggestion would have been to determine what really has the child unhappy.  Does she want to read and is she feeling desperate and anxious that she can&#39;t?  Would she like some help in learning how to read? Is she interested in seeking help beyond what I can do for her?  Or is she okay with her inability to read, and just needing my help in negotiating the social aspects of being not yet a reader? What I did next to support my child would depend on what she told me she wanted and needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, if I found myself posting to a list where I was regularly moderated and unpublished, I would unsub, and find a group that better fit my own philosophies. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":314584010,"authorName":"rainas_family","from":"&quot;rainas_family&quot; &lt;dana.and.homer@...&gt;","profile":"rainas_family","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1298377714","msgId":59992,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlrMGE1aSszb2FvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrMDBiaStxNTRuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59991,"nextInTopic":59993,"prevInTime":59991,"nextInTime":59993,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I just want to say how much I ve appreciated this list over the years.

Last year my family went to the Rethinking Everything conference in Texas. This was our very first trip to be around other unschoolers and we were so excited.  We lasted for 2 days before we ran out of patience with all the children who were bullies, rude, unsafe etc.  I was often the only parent around a group of half a dozen young kids throwing legos, taking legos from my son, and causing mayhem.  I saw toddlers walking around without adults around pools.  The list goes on and on. It was a shock to me to see such a different perspective than what I read about here.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that trip, I didn&#39;t know there was a different kind of unschooling.

The mother got the same advice from a number of other people, which was to wait and do nothing because the daughter would catch up to her peers with her reading eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI unsubscribed from the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate that my views on reading are not totally in harmony with the views of many other unschoolers, so I&#39;m curious to know what others here would have done in that mother&#39;s circumstances; and also I&#39;m wondering if anybody here has had the experience of having a reply to a &quot;radical unschooling&quot; list simply ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1298362964","msgId":59988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYwNTQ3OThBLTRDNUYtNDNBQy1CQjhDLTQ2QTkzOUQzNjhERUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5MzEwMS4xODkyNS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqZGtwNCs0a2kwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODhDNjFBRjUtQjFDRS00NkQ4LUEzM0QtRTE5REVDNDE1OTg4QHlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEQ2MEMzMzhDLTQyQjUtNEYwMC05RTkyLUEwNzUyNDcxRjJGMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDMxMzAyNzk0LTVGQkUtNEY3NS1CMDI3LTg4MDIwOENBNDc1OEB5YWhvby5jb20+IDw4OTMxMDEuMTg5MjUucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDAxLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59987,"nextInTopic":59991,"prevInTime":59987,"nextInTime":59989,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Would people here say that this is unschooling?

I had never even heard of unschooling at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that at the time, it was about me.  I was not planning on becoming a mother and I wanted some guidance.  I had an abusive mother and a neglectful father and was the first child of Korean immigrants who didn&#39;t speak English very well.  I was not going to raise my daughter the way I was raised, but I didn&#39;t know what way was going to replace it.  I was practicing attachment parenting -- drug-free, pain-free home birth, extended, on-demand breastfeeding until I couldn&#39;t during the pregnancy of the second (it broke my heart and my first-born&#39;s, sadly) though I had planned on tandem nursing if the eldest wanted to continue.  Our family bed became a room of mattresses side by side.  I felt I had poor boundaries, though, with my girls and I wanted to figure out how to have healthier ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe playgroup I was in was based on a different philosophy that some have called anti-AP.  I suppose I wanted something to challenge me to think about how I was parenting and why.  The philosophy of the group suggested raising an authentic, self-confident baby and that appealed to me.  I didn&#39;t follow their suggestions blindly, but tried on what I thought was beneficial and rejected what I thought was damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy tendency was towards supporting my child&#39;s needs at any cost, but the group&#39;s philosophy suggested more of a draw-a-line-in-the-sand where the parent has needs kind of approach.  Whereas most in the group practiced some form of sleep-training, I never did.  Whereas there was a child in the group that cried a lot (he was upset by many things that would not bother other children there) mine happened to be untouched by the drama that sometimes unfolded.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4.5 year old emerged from the group an outspoken, articulate, determined, self-confident and affectionate girl.  My husband and I had a theory that she came out &quot;strong&quot; because we did maintain more of an attachment parenting approach.  He and I believed that she felt more secure in who she was because we were there for her, we never let her cry it out for any reason.  If she had a toy taken from her, she was more the type to take it back or immediately come to me or her dad for comfort.  The group was generally set up in a way that the parents sat on one side of the room, the kids playing with only one or two adults near them.  It may sound ludicrous, but we were attempting as a group to learn by observing the kids play -- the idea was to give them space to explore and intervene when safety might be compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the responses here seem to suggest that a child would be excluded and picked on for months, that was never the case.  There was an alpha male child and there was a boy who cried a lot for many reasons -- it could be because another child came too close to him, but did not even touch him.  There was a girl who started to really hit others consistently.  The alpha male became the first to show empathy and sharing.  The often-crying boy became best friends with the alpha and later took on more alpha traits -- like he was &quot;trying&quot; them on.  The girl who hit frequently was asked to be restrained or removed by her mother for both that girl&#39;s well-being and for the other kids.  When a child cried, the room often fell silent as the parent consoled the child.  The other children stopped to see what was happening and the parents stopped any chatting if there was chatting happening.  Like I said, we were trying our best to observe the kids, so often we were not treating it like a social hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child seemed consistently fragile, like the boy who cried frequently, or the one who always wanted his mother to stay near him, these children were protected more by the adults near them or by their mothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not suggesting this was unschooling, only trying to flesh out the experience I had because it seems by the responses here, some may believe that children were subjected to unnecessary repeated and frequent emotional hardship for the purposes of a few learning empathy.  This is not to say that crying never happened or that a child never got a toy taken from her.  Patterns of difficulty or challenge were dealt with, usually by prevention.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my 4.5 year old -- I think I&#39;ve always known what she wants -- for her mom and dad to be near her and to provide for her needs and wants.  From as early as she could gesture (and do sign language -- sigh if you must, but we used sign language with her as an infant) she has let us know what she needed and wanted.  She looked forward to her group and missed it when it was over.  While I didn&#39;t learn the importance if connection there, I did learn to give my daughter a safe space and the support and freedom to try things for herself.  It&#39;s why she chose to go down a slide by herself at 10-11 months&#39; age and why at 4 she body boards with glee even when she wipes out.  It&#39;s why she made heart sponge cakes and wrapped them in fondant for valentines (with her parents&#39; help) and why she just learned to ride a bike without training wheels this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmotionally, I am her safe space.  I have tried my best from the beginning of her life to respond immediately to her cries, and later, her requests.  With my husband, we have taken nonviolent communication classes and worked on our marriage to improve ourselves, our relationships and our parenting.  I&#39;ve been far from perfect, but I&#39;m learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to learning about unschooling and this list, I am focusing on maintaining the trust and connection with both of my girls.  I have been finding that focus to be key to peace and harmony in our home.  I only wish I had heard about the benefits of unschooling sooner!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have an agenda (anymore!) but I think my husband still does -- which is based in his fear that we (or that I) am spoiling our girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a theory that people need to experience being able to have anything they want before they can really figure out what it is that they want (is that kind of part of unschooling?) and I think my husband has not ever experienced that (a product of an unplanned pregnancy of teen parents who were from blue-collar families who then grew up with a severely physically handicapped sister and also a severely bipolar sister).  I think that people who don&#39;t know what they want are in a less than ideal state.  It is harder for my husband to see the girls get so much when he had so little.  He thinks he&#39;s doing them a favor by being conditional and stern with them.  I see him as eroding his relationship with them, but I&#39;m not sure what I can do to help except trade places with him.  He&#39;s staying at home with them right now while I work...but I digress...<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1298310909","msgId":59963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc3NDkxLjc3MjA4LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqdDk5NCtidTlsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqdDk5NCtidTlsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59962,"nextInTopic":59986,"prevInTime":59962,"nextInTime":59964,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe the children in this play group where really mellow and laid back.

While I tried to describe the approach to dealing with sharing (or lack thereof) or even grabbing, my picture is incomplete.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe group spent much time observing and discussing what to do or say in different situations.  Observing and thoughtfully responding after waiting a moment, allowed a child room and time and space to cry and to actually feel for herself the emotion before being picked up. Observing and responding thoughtfully put the parents in the habit of being more mindful and aware of the child&#39;s needs in the moment (i.e.  Suzy&#39;s fragile today because she was up all night with teething pain and is not rested so I&#39;m staying near her and going to keep her feeling safe today -- this would include anyone taking her toys).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, it was not a hard and fast rule to let kids just take whatever whenever from whomever.  It also was not a situation that was untended or unmoderated.  The best choices were not always made, in my opinion, but as a group, we tried to operate out of respect for the children and make choices accordingly.  We worked hard to really learn to observe and refrain from projecting what we thought was happening.  At the early stages of toddlers giving and taking toys, without intervention, projection or reaction from the parents, we collectively observed that sometimes giving or taking something is not at all about possession, but as a way to communicate a need or a want to connect with another.  Of course, sometimes it was about the toy.  I learned that a child may be crying over a toy for a myriad of reasons, sometimes having nothing to do with the toy or even the person taking the toy.  I also learned that sometimes, it&#39;s just a mystery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI began to also see that emotions are really tricky to deal with in little ones when the parent (myself!) is still sorting out things like boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to Sandra&#39;s quote -- I don&#39;t think I am able to &quot;allow&quot; crying over a sharing conflict.  I just think it happens sometimes.  It never felt right to try to protect kids from all the bumps and bruises that might befall them -- whether literally or figuratively.  I could be like a guard and try to protect my little ones from ever having a reason to cry, but I felt that would be disingenuous as I will not always be there.  I decided it was more respectful to allow my children to experience the not-so-great feelings like disappointment when something was taken from them or not shared with them but be near by to comfort them if that&#39;s what they wanted.  I could not make another child (or person) share and while this might be a huge disappointment, it also meant that when my child did not want to share, I would not make her share.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do try to keep things at home in private places that are just for personal use and we also do not take things to the park or another person&#39;s house unless we are willing to share them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrying for us is not a justified means of teaching empathy, but a reality of a full emotional life.  I hope that empathy might be the fruit borne of experiencing disappointment and crying -- whether in oneself or another, but I did not mean to say that crying should be allowed to happen for the sake of teaching empathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1298211327","msgId":59899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ2MEMzMzhDLTQyQjUtNEYwMC05RTkyLUEwNzUyNDcxRjJGMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg4QzYxQUY1LUIxQ0UtNDZEOC1BMzNELUUxOURFQzQxNTk4OEB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlqZGtwNCs0a2kwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODhDNjFBRjUtQjFDRS00NkQ4LUEzM0QtRTE5REVDNDE1OTg4QHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59896,"nextInTopic":59903,"prevInTime":59898,"nextInTime":59900,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This of course, only transpired because the parents had all agreed philosophically to allow the toddlers to take from each other, to NOT share, with the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2146982570\">-=-This of course, only transpired because the parents had all agreed philosophically to allow the toddlers to take from each other, to NOT share, with the understanding that when you stop the taking, you don&#39;t allow the giving to spring up from within.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be a problem with a group where &quot;the parents all agree&quot; about something like how to speak to children, and to allow toddlers to grab without sharing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be the &quot;understanding&quot; that when you allow grabbing, all the children will come to equal understandings, as though they will all agree philosophically to allow giving to spring up from within.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are very generous, with their things, their time and their money.  They didn&#39;t get there by my allowing a group of other mothers to tell me to let other kids grab things away from them.  They got there each in their own ways, from parents being generous with them, and by parents helping them feel safe with their things and their early possessiveness.  If someone feels that what they have can be taken away, they&#39;re more likely to become possessive and clinging than they are to become generous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe it&#39;s true that unless children have choices they can&#39;t *make* choices.  If I had forced or pressed my children to be generous, they could not have chosen to be generous.  If I had given them no choice by allowing other to take from them, that&#39;s about the same as pressing them to be generous, only there would&#39;ve been crying and frustration and confusion, the same as if I had told them NOT to let anyone take things from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years we were one of or the only lead family in a weekly gathering, which started in parks and ended up, in the last year and a half, to often meet in our house.  Before the other kids came over, my kids put their favorite things away, and brought out things they were willing to share.

With that in mind, I do my best to show empathy when the kids are having a conflict over a toy.  Showing empathy in those situations may look different in different situations.  Sometimes, I try to express empathy for both kids while verbalizing what I am observing -- &quot;It looks like you really want the ball!  She has the ball and is holding on to it and wouldn&#39;t give it to you.&quot; depending on the ages of the kids, their age difference, their familiarity with each other, it would totally affect how I would respond.

And that&#39;s probably one of the most important things to keep in mind about unschooling ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child has trouble having other people play with his or her toys, then it can help to have playdates elsewhere - &quot;neutral territory&quot; is a good way to avert a number of different social issues related to personal space/possessiveness. Of course, that doesn&#39;t work so well with siblings! Then it can help to make, say, the living room &quot;neutral territory&quot; and use bedrooms or other spaces for special toys or games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest issue parents run into with sharing is that parents get hung up on ideas of &quot;fairness&quot; and confusing them with reciprcation and equality. Happiness and peace are better goals than fairness in that sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; another example is a parent threatening some random consequence...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wait, do you mean you want to know how to handle other parents? That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother ball of wax. If they aren&#39;t threatening your child, then intervening is something to be done very very carefully. Did you see the thread on intervening about spanking? The same sort of advice would apply - you can&#39;t teach other parents what they don&#39;t want to know, but you *can* look for ways to be kind and thoughtful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so here is where i get confused:<br/>\n&gt; the caring unschooling parent wants to help their child learn how to at peace and safe in the world. what kind of social advice can the unschooling parent offer about how to be safe and kind?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nOffering advice isn&#39;t a great strategy unless your child is specifically asking for some. Its better to look for ways to help: &quot;let me help you do that safely&quot;. Or offer help in an arguement &quot;can I help?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBut mostly I find that the kinder and more thoughtful I am to my kids, the kinder and more thoughful they are, too. Not just &quot;in the long run&quot; but in small day to day things. If my kids are getting snappish, I do an attitude check - for myself I mean. Am I snapping and snarling? Changing my own mindset can go a long way to creating harmony in the house. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1297775872","msgId":59788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4RThFRUYyLUY0NTYtNDY1NS05MTIyLTlCQ0VBQkVBQzYyOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRFOTRGQzBFLUY5RjEtNDU5Ny04MTQ3LUI5MDhERDg3QTc2REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlqZGtwNCs0a2kwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjI1MEQ1OTUtQjE4Qy00Mjk4LUE0NTctNUNDNkYxQjUyRUMwQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NEU5NEZDMEUtRjlGMS00NTk3LTgxNDctQjkwOEREODdBNzZEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59786,"nextInTopic":59789,"prevInTime":59787,"nextInTime":59789,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And, even with adult experience, there are  <br/>\ncountries and groups that people can&#39;t figure out how to help  <br/>\npeacefully coexist. People have been telling others not to make war --  <br/>\nat least in a big way -- since 1960s. It hasn&#39;t worked yet! Because  <br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t do that&quot; doesn&#39;t help them with what to do instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n From the child&#39;s point of view what they want is right there just a  <br/>\nstone&#39;s throw away from them. The only problem is there&#39;s a chasm and  <br/>\nan about to collapse bridge (called &quot;hitting&quot; and &quot;grabbing&quot;) between  <br/>\nthem and it that they&#39;ve been told not to use. The second problem is  <br/>\nthat the route -- of principles -- you&#39;ve lead them on in the past  <br/>\nheads off in the wrong direction with lots of confusing turns before  <br/>\nit gets to the destination. Kids need lots of help negotiating the  <br/>\nindirect path before they have confidence that it&#39;s something they  <br/>\nunderstand and can do themselves. If you&#39;re not there to help, is it  <br/>\nsurprising if a child chooses the direct but forbidden route?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a principle would be safety and kindness, for example. that would be  <br/>\n&gt; something the unschooled child would learn by observing the parent  <br/>\n&gt; being safe and kind and keeping property safe from harm, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A bit but not in a big meaningful way. They&#39;ll learn the most when you  <br/>\nuse your principles as tools to help them get what they want. And when  <br/>\nyou use your principles in how you treat them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are treated kindly treat others kindly (when they&#39;re  <br/>\ndevelopmentally able). Kids who are treated unkindly and made to be  <br/>\nkind to others will feel resentful that kindness is being withheld  <br/>\nfrom them and given to a stranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so here is where i get confused:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the caring unschooling parent wants to help their child learn how to  <br/>\n&gt; at peace and safe in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Stop right there. That&#39;s where you&#39;re confused! Let go of the lessons  <br/>\nyou want your child to learn. *Live* your principles. Put your  <br/>\nprinciples into practice. Use them as tools to help kids get what they  <br/>\nwant. Use them to keep them safe. Use them in your treatment of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, stop them when they&#39;re being unkind to someone else but see their  <br/>\nbehavior as communication. *Assume* the child is doing the best they  <br/>\ncan. And if their best could be better -- sometimes *way* better in  <br/>\nthe case of hitting! ;-) -- then they need help. Focus on the need  <br/>\nthey were trying to meet and meet it in a way that is in keeping with  <br/>\nyour principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what kind of social advice can the unschooling parent offer about  <br/>\n&gt; how to be safe and kind?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My advice is to stop thinking in terms of lessons!  :-) Think in terms  <br/>\nof learning -- absorbing bit by bit -- from living.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i assume it won&#39;t be &quot;rules&quot; such as &quot;don&#39;t grab,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t hit,&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;don&#39;t destroy other people&#39;s stuff&quot; etc<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Instead of focusing on what not to do and assuming the child has evil  <br/>\nin him that must be crushed for fear of it growing. Focus on what to  <br/>\ndo instead. Yes, stop the hitting and grabbing but then move on to  <br/>\nhelping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the example i gave above, about sharing, i have personally  <br/>\n&gt; handled it by acknowledging that sharing a special toy can be hard,  <br/>\n&gt; to which my daughter has usually nodded her head &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a stranger started rooting around in your purse, and you grabbed it  <br/>\nback, should I talk to you about sharing?<br/>\n<br/>\nSharing is greatly overrated! And if a child doesn&#39;t have a choice on  <br/>\nwhether someone can use their things, it&#39;s not sharing. It&#39;s letting  <br/>\npeople walk all over you ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s not her toy but belongs to a community playspace, I would ask  <br/>\nmy daughter if she didn&#39;t mind letting the other child use it. Or if  <br/>\nthere was something she would let them play with. I&#39;d reassure my  <br/>\ndaughter or the other child that they&#39;d be done soon and it would be  <br/>\nfree. (Though you need to be mighty certain that&#39;s true! Mostly Kat  <br/>\nplayed at a Children&#39;s Museum so no one ever did spend more than a few  <br/>\nminutes with any particular toy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the playing is at her house, it would be respectful to help her  <br/>\ndecide before hand what can be played with and what can&#39;t and only  <br/>\nbring out the toys she doesn&#39;t mind others using. If she decides mid  <br/>\nplay that something isn&#39;t for sharing, then put that away for her. If  <br/>\nshe&#39;s too young and wants to play with it but not let anyone else,  <br/>\nthen it&#39;s snack time :-) Or break out something else that&#39;s even more  <br/>\ndrawing. Distraction is a good tool :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416377114,"authorName":"rubixscuba","from":"&quot;rubixscuba&quot; &lt;rebecca@...&gt;","profile":"rubixscuba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1297765988","msgId":59781,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqZGtwNCs0a2kwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0NzgxOC44OTYxNy5xbUB3ZWIxNjIwMTYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59754,"nextInTopic":59783,"prevInTime":59780,"nextInTime":59782,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"as a n00b, i d love to hear a bit more about this because i agree there is a misconception out there about unschooling parents being too hands off and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1478902266\">as a n00b, i&#39;d love to hear a bit more about this because i agree there is a misconception &quot;out there&quot; about unschooling parents being too hands off and borderline negligent as they let their kids run amok with no regard for their safety or that of others or anyone&#39;s property. <br/>\n<br/>\n===there have peen people who call themselves radical unschoolers, and defend their own choices to never give their child any social advice for example, as being what defines radical unschooling.  It&#39;s a level of detachment I&#39;m not comfortable with, one that has resulted in my kids and other kids I know and love being victimized, while the parent of the offender stood by and did nothing.===<br/>\n<br/>\ni have seen the above in my community too, although i do not know if the parents thought they were &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; or it they were just so checked out or confused or strive to be non-authoritarian that they didn&#39;t intervene in the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\non the other hand, i often see parents rightfully intervene, but in ways that i find disturbing. for example, a personal situation i have had to figure out is how to handle sharing. i often see parents grabbing a toy that their child grabbed out of another child&#39;s hands while saying &quot;don&#39;t grab,&quot; ie sending mixed messages and forcing kids to share perhaps before the child is developmentally really ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nanother example is a parent threatening some random consequence if the child does not comply with whatever the parent says (which can be completely reasonable, such as &quot;don&#39;t hit other kids,&quot; but then there is a threatening element of &quot;or else....&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d love to hear some thoughts on how an unschooling parent would handle these kinds of situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n===We unschool and parent as we do because kindness and respect for others are important to us.===<br/>\n<br/>\nphew, what a relief! i really liked reading this! <br/>\n<br/>\ni think i understand the idea behind living by principles, as opposed to rules. a principle would be safety and kindness, for example. that would be something the unschooled child would learn by observing the parent being safe and kind and keeping property safe from harm, yes? of course the child doesn&#39;t learn all of this &quot;right away,&quot; but the parent knows learning involves making mistakes and is OK with that (as opposed to thinking mistakes must be corrected by punitive measures). <br/>\n<br/>\nso here is where i get confused:<br/>\nthe caring unschooling parent wants to help their child learn how to at peace and safe in the world. what kind of social advice can the unschooling parent offer about how to be safe and kind? i assume it won&#39;t be &quot;rules&quot; such as &quot;don&#39;t grab,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t hit,&quot; &quot;don&#39;t destroy other people&#39;s stuff&quot; etc and of course it won&#39;t be said in an &quot;or else&quot; kind of way that carries with it threats of punishments... i also assume a connected parent won&#39;t decide to keep silent and let their child hurt someone else and thereby learn by &quot;natural consequences&quot; that they should be kind or they might lose all their friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nin the example i gave above, about sharing, i have personally handled it by acknowledging that sharing a special toy can be hard, to which my daughter has usually nodded her head &quot;yes.&quot; if the other parent is close by i try to let them know too that we are working on sharing still. usually taking the pressure off my child helps and she will share after a few moments, but sometimes it doens&#39;t. sometimes we might try to brainstorm some ideas together and pick one that seems to work (like let&#39;s put the toy away for later, or why don&#39;t you pick out a toy that you do want to share, or let&#39;s use a timer and take turns so it&#39;s fair). sometimes that works and sometimes not. sometimes we just rely on our friends to be forgiving and hope that the next time things will go smoother. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat do you think? i&#39;d love to read stuff about how children learn manners, kindness, safety and respect for other people&#39;s property.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\n--rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks","postDate":"1297705236","msgId":59754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0NzgxOC44OTYxNy5xbUB3ZWIxNjIwMTYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59781,"prevInTime":59753,"nextInTime":59755,"topicId":59754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Like Pam, I find myself looking other words to describe how we live.  In my recent conversations, and sadly in my own community, there have peen people who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2116720472\">Like Pam, I find myself looking other words to describe how we live.  In my recent conversations, and sadly in my own community, there have peen people who call themselves radical unschoolers, and defend their own choices to never give their child any social advice for example, as being what defines radical unschooling.  It&#39;s a level of detachment I&#39;m not comfortable with, one that has resulted in my kids and other kids I know and love being victimized, while the parent of the offender stood by and did nothing.  We&#39;ve been fortunate in that eventually the other child&#39;s inability to be kind to my children has led to my children wanting less time with that child, until the friendships quietly died out.  It saddens me because I wonder when and how those children will figure out how to keep friendships and build relationships, with virtually no guidance, advice or insight into how people want to be treated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was never really attached to the term radical unschooler, so I&#39;m okay with letting others have it.  We unschool and parent as we do because kindness and respect for others are important to us.  Most of my parenting philosophies predate unschooling in our lives, so I don&#39;t feel any need to explain our lifestyle as being part and parcel of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60055,"nextTopicId":60076}}
