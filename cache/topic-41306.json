This is very much<br/>\nhow I see unschooling as an extension of the ways I&#39;ve practiced attachment<br/>\nparenting, and in fact I see unschooling as another practice that continues<br/>\nattachment between parent and child.  I&#39;m enjoying seeing what can be seen<br/>\nof my child&#39;s progress and just enjoying my child.  That&#39;s a huge plus over<br/>\nbeing relieved to be rid of what&#39;s often perceived as peskiness.  (Visiting<br/>\nwith my dad brings this into sharp focus, the fact that others see Karl as a<br/>\npesky childish nuisance rather than a interesting person who&#39;s interested in<br/>\nothers.  Gosh I so much prefer my own perception.  :D  )<br/>\n<br/>\nTo many mainstream parents, me saying that unschooling is an extension of<br/>\nattachment parenting may sound like I&#39;m a mama who can&#39;t &quot;cut the apron<br/>\nstrings&quot; and encourage my child to get independent within an appropriate<br/>\ntime frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, like Melissa says, I think children want independence much sooner<br/>\nthan the majority of parents want to see it, and that children want<br/>\nindependence not all at once but in that slow slow process of integration<br/>\nover a period of years, during the entire time they live with their parents,<br/>\nwhen and as they feel like it.  In what looks to many like &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;no&quot;<br/>\nprogress.  It&#39;s why unschooling is so friendly for all children regardless<br/>\nof what categories the children fall into in the school environment, whether<br/>\noverall they&#39;re perceived as slow, fast, or average.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo wonder the kids gain confidence in who they are.
