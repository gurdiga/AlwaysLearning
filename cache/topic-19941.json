The thing I am most concerned with <br/>\nis that in divorcing my husband, that the judge in CA here will make <br/>\nme place my children back into &quot;school&quot;, as I have heard that judges <br/>\ndo not look to kindly on homeschoolers and I do not have the money <br/>\nbehind me to fight him in court. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot seem to make him see, not to change him, but to just agree <br/>\nto the fact that in a divorce that I can still homeschool. <br/>\nTherefore, rather than fight him, I have just elected to stay <br/>\nmarried to him in &quot;name only&quot; until the children are of age (this <br/>\nlooking to be about 12 years) and then I can divorce him. This will <br/>\nstill give me the freedom to unschool (life learn) with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I went through a seminar three years ago, that gave me what you <br/>\nwrote here a REAL hard look a that. I am not the same person I was 3 <br/>\nyears ago, although my husband chooses not to see that. He is still <br/>\nstuck in the past and views me in that way, as in the past I admit, <br/>\nI was a person who thought &quot;If only I could change him&quot;. I was young <br/>\nand naive in the earlier years of our marriage I know. <br/>\n<br/>\n3 years ago was as you said, a real wake up call. And I have grown <br/>\nso much since then. This journey to unschooling too has made me <br/>\ngrown SO much as well, so much of that I am not able to share with <br/>\nhim because he will not allow me. He as as you said Kay, in that <br/>\nvictimhood, his payoff of saying he is the victim all the time, when <br/>\nhe is not in integrity with me and lies and hurts the boys and I. <br/>\nAnd the boys see this, I do not need to tell them anything. They see <br/>\nfor themselves his lies and his lack of responsibility and lack of <br/>\nintegrity and how he is not willing to share all of the wonder and <br/>\nawe of unschooling with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know now that because of all of this, that I must walk away from <br/>\nthis relationship and move on with my life. I have tried to reach <br/>\nhim but after the events of this past weekend, I just cannot seem to <br/>\nand know what it is I need to do. I had hoped to be able to finish <br/>\nmy book I am writing about life learning and to have set up a <br/>\nprivate ISP here, but it looks as if I will be moving due to the <br/>\ncurrent circumstances and alas there will be no book. I am not <br/>\ncurrently working and I now have to find a way to continue to <br/>\nunschool and bring in income for my family, as the trust between him <br/>\nand I is now gone forever and the marriage is going to be &quot;in name <br/>\nonly&quot; from this point forward. I cannot rely on the fact that he <br/>\nwill continue to support us after the events of this weekend. And I <br/>\ncannot go after any for of support in a divorce because it would <br/>\nmean the kids will have to go back to school and for their happiness <br/>\nand emotional well being, we all know they are far better off <br/>\nunschooling despite what he says (or my family for the matter, he <br/>\nhas now spoken to them today in an attempt to try and get them on <br/>\nhis side of which my parents are no for homeschooling let alone <br/>\nunschooling, you should see the ridiculous email my father sent me. <br/>\nCompletely emotionally abusive and no basis for fact in <br/>\nhomeschooling. I should post what he wrote on here so everyone could <br/>\nsee what a ridiculous email it was) I can only hope he will do the <br/>\nright thing by his boys, but I do not know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Kay for your words of wisdom, they have been mirroring my <br/>\nthoughts, observations, and path.
