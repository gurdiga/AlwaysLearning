Some let the kids decide unless there&#39;s an event, a visit, or guests.   By the time they&#39;re 14, 15, most teen are showering every day by choice, in my experience.  Sometimes twice a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolding the door for someone varies regionally.  Some place, if a woman holds a door for a man, it causes embarrassment and discomfort, and that cancels out courtesy.   Holly and I were in another state lately where, apparently, the tradition is different.  Holly was carrying a box, and I was too.  I passed through the door, walked a way, and waited as a grown man, two teenaged boys and a couple of young women walked by smiling at me, and then Holly (who had been holding the door for all of them, with her box) came along shaking her head.    In Albuquerque, people hold the door for people carrying boxes or babies or whatever, and all non-load-bearing able-bodied people hand the door-holding off to one another (and sometimes someone will hold a door for a group or series of people).<br/>\n<br/>\nTable manners is a HUGE range above and beyond all that.  There are rules, and traditions, and levels of formality, and ways to be in different countries.  Americans need to be careful in some other places.  There are things we do routinely that are wrong (potentially disgusting) elsewhere.  But there are things that are rude anywhere, and not learning to eat with one&#39;s mouth closed, and not learning how to hold utensils (whichever utensils are used, and however they are politely used in that place) are not cool past young childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Table Manners","postDate":"1303314644","msgId":60756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlvbXZjaysxZW92QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvbDhkditrdXNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60755,"nextInTopic":60757,"prevInTime":60755,"nextInTime":60757,"topicId":60741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t consider using common courtesies such as bathing, using table manners and holding the door for someone following rules.

It sort of encourages proper manners, if the child  to use the wants to use them and maybe it would just lighten things up a bit for the friend.  We play, &quot;That&#39;s not proper manners&quot;.<br/>\nTotally for fun or sometimes in situations when someone is criticizing my kids manners.  We use our manners, both proper and improper, and when we catch someone not having proper manners we all shout, &quot;That&#39;s not proper manners!&quot;  It has made catching someone with bad manners a game and very funny because we all get totally outrageous and start putting our feet on the table, pretending to pick our noses etc.  Maybe a variation of this game would change the mood without much fuss.<br/>\nJoanne<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;redknot20&quot; &lt;redknot@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,  I joined this group a few weeks ago and have really enjoyed reading the posts.

It really bothers me for people to &quot;crunch&quot;--to eat with their mouths open like dogs.  REALLY bothers me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no social, moral or educational advantage to unschoolers having bad manners.    It&#39;s not arbitrary.  There ARE real reasons to eat politely and courteously.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206447840,"authorName":"Dragonfly","from":"Dragonfly &lt;nalmeida12@...&gt;","profile":"nalmeida12","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Table Manners","postDate":"1303263868","msgId":60749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ5OTNDQTExLTU3QUEtNDk3My1BRDkyLUFFNUYzNjY4MkUzN0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60745,"nextInTopic":60753,"prevInTime":60748,"nextInTime":60750,"topicId":60741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Isn t he just mirroring what you did to him when you asked him to stop burping at the table?
