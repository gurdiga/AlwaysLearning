He also wrote his C backwards when writing a word.  He prints all words in caps and it is readable and fairly neat but I don&#39;t think he knows how to write smaller letters.\n\nHe did recognize that the 3 was backwards and grinned telling me he had dyslexia.  I&#39;m not sure he recognizes when he does it all the time.  That is because I told him some time ago that I suspected he had it.  I made it clear that it had nothing to do with his intelligence and he seemed very relieved to know there might be a good reason for his difficulties.

I&#39;m only saying this as an observation and not because I think they should have gone to school for the purposes of writing because I have no doubt that it would have come at a great cost but it is the only explanation I can think of as to why their peers are writing and they aren&#39;t.  There is no reason for them to write on paper at home anything more than a few words.  </span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E132\" style=\"list-style-type:none;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E133\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E134\" style=\"list-style-type:none;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E135\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E136\" style=\"list-style-type:none;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E137\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;\">&quot;I</span><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E138\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">f they were never in school, and if you want to share why you think they didn&#39;t find more opportunities to write just a bit, or write numbers, that might be helpful to other unschoolers.&quot;</span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E139\" style=\"list-style-type:none;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E140\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E141\" style=\"list-style-type:none;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802217742E142\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My children have never been in school.

Activities such as sports and dance are in the afternoon.  They have been to 6 different countries in the past 8 months so we travel quite a bit. We go locally to many different cultural events/fests.  Their days don&#39;t naturally incorporate writing of any kind on paper.

It was just for my benefit, and she let me keep it and share it, but there&#39;s a misspelling, and it doesn&#39;t look like a near-college-aged person&#39;s writing is thought to look.  As to the other writing, below that, some was by unschoolers, some by late-teen/young-adult &quot;school kids,&quot; some by college students or graduates.  My own writing is &quot;and heard music playing!&quot;   It&#39;s not pretter than soe of the others.  But for the purposes of this game, that didn&#39;t matter.  The exploding banjo comment (based on a picture I drew, in my attempt to show a &quot;bad ass banjo&quot;) is all block printed and the &quot;e&quot; are funny, but the comment was GREAT, and that was good writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHandwriting is not the same as writing is.  That&#39;s important for unschooling parents to really think about.  Writing has to do with ideas and the sound and flow and choice of words.

He also wrote his C backwards when writing a word.  He prints all words in caps and it is readable and fairly neat but I don&#39;t think he knows how to write smaller letters.\n\nHe did recognize that the 3 was backwards and grinned telling me he had dyslexia.  I&#39;m not sure he recognizes when he does it all the time.  That is because I told him some time ago that I suspected he had it.  I made it clear that it had nothing to do with his intelligence and he seemed very relieved to know there might be a good reason for his difficulties.  I asked him if anyone says anything when he writes his bowling scores down when he is in the bowling league and he told me that the instructor asked him if he realized he was writing his numbers backwards and he told the instructor that he had difficulty with numbers.</span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E124\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E125\" style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E126\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E127\" style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&quot;Why do you think it&#39;s a lie, if she and her brother both are having that much trouble at this age?&quot; </span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E128\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E129\" style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E130\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E131\" style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hunter&#39;s is probably due to dyslexia but all three rarely write on paper and when they do, it is just their name or doodling or drawing.

Activities such as sports and dance are in the afternoon.  They have been to 6 different countries in the past 8 months so we travel quite a bit. We go locally to many different cultural events/fests.  Their days don&#39;t naturally incorporate writing of any kind on paper.  Chloe used to like pretend being a waitress, taking our order and serving us play food but she hasn&#39;t done this in a long time. \n\nI asked about Hunter&#39;s spelling a year or so ago on this list and got the mad libs and a few other suggestions including a diary of some sort where a question is asked and you answer it but I think he did that for a couple of days and that was it.</span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E147\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270yui_3_15_0_1_1437429545698_2300\"><span style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270E147\" style=\"list-style-type:none;padding-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.2;font-size:16px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Tinos, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Bell MT', serif;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1279817270yui_3_15_0_1_1437429545698_2300\"><span style=\"display:inline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I guess I&#39;m just stuck in how this occurs naturally in those who may not be particularly interested in writing and what would motivate someone their age with little interest to write on paper?

He finds writing extremely hard, and will avoid it if at all possible. His handwriting looks similar to probably a 5 year olds (he&#39;s 9), and though he can read and spell, he forgets how to form certain letters when writing because he does it so rarely.<br><br>So far that hasn&#39;t been a problem - he will sign his name in a card, and we have only had one time where he was asked (out of the blue) to write in public - at soccer they asked him to write his full name in a card to the coach at the end of the season. I realised at that point he didn&#39;t know how to write his full name (he was 8 - and he wasn&#39;t reading then). He just wrote &#39;Kai&#39; and I said that&#39;d be OK since he&#39;s the only Kai on the team - but we went home and practiced writing his full name until he could do it.<br><br>He types on the computer, on Skype chat, text messages, on Instagram - so his written communications are just fine....but at some point the writing may become an issue, and there really aren&#39;t natural opportunities to practice that are popping up in our life.<br><br>So that is our experience so far.<div>Cheers</div><div>Jo<br><br><br><div><br><div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

and get quite proficient at the things that really interest him. &nbsp;By doing so, he has developed a deep trust in his own ability to learn what he needs to learn to do what he wants to do.</p><p

&nbsp;His comprehension is good. &nbsp;His vocabulary is excellent. &nbsp;He can type using his style of typing pretty effectively. &nbsp;Hence, his communication skills are good, I&#39;d say.

She says that she is going to be embarrassed because she doesn&#39;t know how to write. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t really know what to say to her other than maybe we could tell the coach she had something like dysgraphia or dyslexia. &nbsp;She was okay with this and then a short time later started crying again and said she didn&#39;t want to go.
