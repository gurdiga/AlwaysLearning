Clare Kirkpatrick has set up a site called Unschooling Moments. It&#39;s subtitled &quot;Glimpes of Joy, Connection and Learning in Radical Unschooling Families.&quot; There are some there to read already and a random-page function (for when there are many more). <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like this project, and am a little sad that my kids are all too old to report on in this way now. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a photo with a small caption, or a longer story (up to 500 words) with a photo (or several), there is a contact form. Clare will e-mail you to get photos.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to subsribe by mail, there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope lots of you will send stories as they come up!  Even if you have your own blog or outlet, maybe if thereâ€™s something you know would help other families, you might send it to clare, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be helpful for reassurance, idea-getting, and for showing people who wonder how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unschoolingmoments.wordpress.com\">https://unschoolingmoments.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76166,"nextTopicId":76205}}
