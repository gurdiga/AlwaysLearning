Then they watch<br/>\ngame shows and soaps, since there isn&#39;t much else on.  They watched the new Herbie movie this<br/>\nmorning, though...  It&#39;s always ok to watch TV when I want to!  LOL!  I know I&#39;m sounding like a<br/>\nhypocrite now, but I have my TV on in the bedroom while I fold laundry or make a to-do list or<br/>\nthey&#39;re busy doing something and I just watch Martha Stewart or The View or something.  And I<br/>\nlearn about food, recipes, crafts, current events, etc, when I watch, so why wouldn&#39;t they?  I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting it now.  I guess I was raised that TV fries kids&#39; brains and isn&#39;t good, and it&#39;s stuck<br/>\nwith me.

That&#39;s not being too teacherly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you just   meant you had to resist teaching them to read musical <br/>\nnotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling and discovery are very cool, but in the face of some new piece of <br/>\nequipment--musical, mechanical, cooking equipment--it&#39;s regular everyday <br/>\ncourtesy to help someone new to that thing understand its operation and dangers <br/>\nand all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t really about the clarinet at all, but about the idea that <br/>\nunschoolers shouldn&#39;t help kids too much for fear of turning into a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne dangerous aspect (dangerous to unschooling, I mean) of teaching is the <br/>\nexpectation of the teacher--the potential frustration and divisive feeling if <br/>\nthe lessons don&#39;t go well.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI let a two year old play with my pump organ the other day.   She would&#39;ve <br/>\ngone for the electric keyboard that was on top of it,   but she had asked what <br/>\nthe pedals did, so I moved the electric keyboard, opened the lid and showed <br/>\nher.   She might be too little to remember, but I think the idea of an instrument <br/>\nthat&#39;s not electric, that has no on/off switch, might stay with her. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I was surrounded by people-powered tools.   My granny&#39;s <br/>\nhouse had a treadle machine, hand-cranked meat grinder, hand-cranked egg beater, <br/>\nhand-cranked drill, and they started their tractor with a crank (though after <br/>\nthat point it was a gas powered engine, of course).    Kids nowadays might see <br/>\nvery few hand-powered tools or even instruments.   Even their parent&#39;s <br/>\nacoustic guitar might have a pickup and an amp.   A friend of mine used to collect <br/>\nelectronic instruments when they first came out. He had an electronic saxophone <br/>\nand guitar and even bagpipes.   You only had to touch the place where you <br/>\nwould have ordinarily have had to cover the hole completely, or only put your <br/>\nfingers where the strings would have been, and strum across where the strings <br/>\nwould have been to make the sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I know...

I used to play clarinet (ages 10 to 14, after <br/>\nwhich I sold it and bought a guitar with the money).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people start to mess with a recorder they tend to blow too hard and to <br/>\ntry to start with all the holes covered up.   That&#39;s one of the hardest notes <br/>\nand it takes the LEAST air, so it&#39;s better to help them find an easier few <br/>\nnotes to try out.   That&#39;s not being too teacherly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you just   meant you had to resist teaching them to read musical <br/>\nnotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling and discovery are very cool, but in the face of some new piece of <br/>\nequipment--musical, mechanical, cooking equipment--it&#39;s regular everyday <br/>\ncourtesy to help someone new to that thing understand its operation and dangers <br/>\nand all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t really about the clarinet at all, but about the idea that <br/>\nunschoolers shouldn&#39;t help kids too much for fear of turning into a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne dangerous aspect (dangerous to unschooling, I mean) of teaching is the <br/>\nexpectation of the teacher--the potential frustration and divisive feeling if <br/>\nthe lessons don&#39;t go well.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI let a two year old play with my pump organ the other day.   She would&#39;ve <br/>\ngone for the electric keyboard that was on top of it,   but she had asked what <br/>\nthe pedals did, so I moved the electric keyboard, opened the lid and showed <br/>\nher.   She might be too little to remember, but I think the idea of an instrument <br/>\nthat&#39;s not electric, that has no on/off switch, might stay with her. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I was surrounded by people-powered tools.   My granny&#39;s <br/>\nhouse had a treadle machine, hand-cranked meat grinder, hand-cranked egg beater, <br/>\nhand-cranked drill, and they started their tractor with a crank (though after <br/>\nthat point it was a gas powered engine, of course).    Kids nowadays might see <br/>\nvery few hand-powered tools or even instruments.   Even their parent&#39;s <br/>\nacoustic guitar might have a pickup and an amp.   A friend of mine used to collect <br/>\nelectronic instruments when they first came out. He had an electronic saxophone <br/>\nand guitar and even bagpipes.   You only had to touch the place where you <br/>\nwould have ordinarily have had to cover the hole completely, or only put your <br/>\nfingers where the strings would have been, and strum across where the strings <br/>\nwould have been to make the sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I know... I went on a little detour. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237503152,"authorName":"barndogzzz@wmconnect.com","from":"barndogzzz@...","profile":"artofthefire","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Expensive MINE things","postDate":"1131376011","msgId":23326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjZjMjA4MTdmLjMwYTBjNzhiQHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":23324,"nextInTopic":23327,"prevInTime":23325,"nextInTime":23327,"topicId":23323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I m new to this group and also new to homeschooling our two daughters so we re still deschooling also.

Your emails reminded me of a <br/>\ntime when I was doing a commissioned piece and my daughters came into my studio <br/>\nasking if they too could do some painting and burning (at the time I was doing <br/>\npyrography/painting on a very large fireplace mantel) So, I went over to <br/>\n&quot;their&quot; shelves of art supplies and got out &quot;their&quot; things. When I carried them <br/>\nover to the table for them the look on their faces were sad and confused but they <br/>\nnever said a word about it, they just started painting and burning. I noticed <br/>\nhow awful their works of art were coming along, it was hard for them, even at <br/>\ntheir young level, to do much detail at all with the lame supplies they had. <br/>\nI ended up taking all of their stuff and throwing it in a box and took all of <br/>\nmy things and let them go for it. I showed them the different strokes each <br/>\nbrush would make and introduced them to my burner, (the one that cost me a <br/>\nbundle)! and also taught them how to care for all of them. The look on their faces <br/>\nwas enough for me, but the art work they produced was unbelievably so much <br/>\nbetter.

After I was finished with it, I gave it back to her.  This summer, she<br/>\ngave it to my dd10, but I still think of it as MINE.  It&#39;s in need of a little repair, but after I<br/>\ntaped down a key whose spring had broken and put a piece of foam in place of a pad, I bought two<br/>\nnew reeds and tried it out.  Oh, was I out of practice!?  I explained that this clarinet was made<br/>\nin the 1960&#39;s, I&#39;d seen used clarinets for $125-$200 at the music store, and they need to treat<br/>\nthe instrument with respect.  I was so scared to let them use it!!!  I showed them where to place<br/>\ntheir fingers and let them go at it.  I started to go down the, &quot;let&#39;s get out the music reader<br/>\nand learn what all the notes are,&quot; but then I had to remind myself that they need to get the feel<br/>\nof the instrument and embouchure and just explore.  I wanted to jump in and play music teacher<br/>\nsooo badly!  (We&#39;re still deschooling...)  So the kids aren&#39;t producing masterpieces yet, but they<br/>\nhave more musical experience in the past two weeks or so than most of the kids in our ps district,<br/>\nwho don&#39;t start band until 7th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnastasia<br/>\n--- Ticia &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ticiamama@...\">ticiamama@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nI was just sitting her having my tea and remembering that when I was a<br/>\nyoung kid I *hated* painting with those stupid *kids* paintbrushes.
