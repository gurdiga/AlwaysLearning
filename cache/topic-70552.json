We have found great benefit to removing pasteurized dairy and replacing it with raw goat&#39;s milk.  Raw goat&#39;s milk is anti-inflammatory while pasteurized dairy is very mucous and inflammation forming.  It just tastes like regular milk & Jade loves it.  We even have our own goats to milk now which is a hoot!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book, which discusses the usefulness of medicinal grade essential oils, includes a case study on a young girl with symptoms similar but more chronic than those you&#39;ve described for your daughter.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Home-Health-Using-Essential/dp/2909531023&lt;http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Home-Health-Using-Essential/dp/2909531023\">http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Home-Health-Using-Essential/dp/2909531023&lt;http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Home-Health-Using-Essential/dp/2909531023</a>&gt;.  The child avoided surgery and improved her health through dietary change and therapeutic essential oils.  I would seek out a copy from the library because for some reason this magical book fetches $90 on amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pursued NAET (Nambudripad&#39;s Allergy Elimination Technique) for my daughter&#39;s chronic allergies which seemed to be helpful.  It is done by a chiropractor or acupuncturist and there is abundant information available online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done a lot of things to try to help her.  Each appointment and each new idea has come with new hope and some encouraging results.  We&#39;ve tried so many things to heal her body and make it stronger but she&#39;s 10 now and some symptoms have lingered.  A common theme that I have read while searching out ideas to help her is the idea that these &quot;problems&quot; are actually symptoms of emotional distress.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve thought a lot about and have tried to understand on a deep enough level to create change but that change has been an ongoing process. I readily admit that I have had a lot of emotional turmoil around her health and issues surrounding it such as her diet (I wish I could say that my emotional turmoils ended there but sadly that was not the case).  All of this was the backdrop to our lives before we started unschooling.  As we have moved further into radical unschooling I have often wondered and hoped that we would feel benefits in the realm of Jade&#39;s health similar to those we&#39;ve felt in other areas of our lives.  The more I &quot;read a little, try a little, wait a little and watch&quot; the more her health issues are making sense in my mind.  I&#39;m realizing how deeply sensitive she is and how different aspects of her life (especially my behavior) are causing her emotional pain and anxiety.  I keep trying to be more gentle, attentive, available, understanding and FUN.  I try to help her live in a world that feels like a safe place.  Four days ago she mentioned to me that she&#39;s been breathing out of her nose most of the time lately!  Wow - that is a first!!!  We have spent so much time, money and energy over the years trying to find ways of &quot;fixing&quot; her problems.  We&#39;ve been deschooling for about 6 months now and her nose is clearing up on it&#39;s own!  In the past I have controlled and cajoled her into dietary changes, gagging down vitamins and a variety of treatments and the symptoms have lingered.  After 6 months of unschooling her emotions are finally starting to heal and her symptoms are starting to subside.  The piles of kleenex are still there but now they have been used to wipe up paint, pudding and the like instead of nose goop.  I wish we had spent more of our time and money having fun and less on appointments but we are doing that now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned that different people experience negative emotions differently in their body.  When I feel stress, for example, I tighten up my entire belly area and hold my anxiety there, causing shallow breathing & difficulty eating & digesting comfortably.  What I had never realized until recently is that some people hold it in their chest and can experience it as a tightness in that area, often described as feeling like an elephant sitting on the chest.  This is exactly what Jade feels!  So I have finally realized that even a label like &quot;asthma&quot; is just a label.  There has been a recent discussion on a different thread on this list about constipation.  I wonder how much of these problems also come from the child&#39;s emotions.  I think it&#39;s very important to give lots of consideration to a child&#39;s emotional world while trying to find ways of bringing comfort & healing to their physical bodies - even if it might not seem to be the most obvious connection.  Radical unschooling is the best answer for healing emotions and relationships that I have found.  It sounds like you haven&#39;t been connecting with this group regularly.  Maybe finding a few minutes here and there throughout each day or several times a week might help you and your daughter as much as it&#39;s helping me and mine.  Surgery and anesthesia are very serious things and once something is removed it can&#39;t be put back, even if you realize down the road that the real source of the problem was something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nCass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Brandynn Stanford&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brandynn@...\">brandynn@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, February 15, 2013 9:54 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids and surgery<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  My son, now 14, had his adenoids removed when he was 10.
