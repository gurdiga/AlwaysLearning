I have four children, ages 16.5, almost<br/>\n13 (in 3 weeks), 9 and 5. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of them are amazing, creative, interesting and intelligent human<br/>\nbeings. My oldest could fix your computer (or build you one) if you<br/>\nhave problems. They&#39;re artists and dreamers and thinkers...all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see NO detrimental effects from television yet. They all have tv in<br/>\ntheir rooms. They have all the video game systems other than the newer<br/>\nPlaystation and Xbox (too expensive right now). They have unlimited<br/>\naccess to computers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the worry is wasted. The only thing tv has done around here is<br/>\nprovide a jumping off point to interesting, swirly conversations,<br/>\nsparked debates and loads of great dress-up and acting.<br/>\nIn short, it facilitates learning of all kinds.
