When dad is sleeping we try not to make noise so he can sleep.<br/>\nThings like that.<br/>\n My kids have no problem following rules where they go, specially now that they are getting older. There is no running at the pool we go to so they do not run<br/>\nand when they forget and get reminded by the lifeguard they slow down and do not get mad or bothered by being called out.<br/>\nThey will talk to me if they think a rule somewhere does not make sense, sometimes they understand , sometimes we come to the conclusion it is not a rule that makes sense but most of the time we need to follow it to be able to be in that place but we usually can see there is a reason for that rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not living int this alternative yes on everything world.

Most unschoolers live in the world, in &quot;this society&quot; whatever that may be - different in cities and towns and rural areas, and different in different parts of the same country and across the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think of unschooling in terms of freedom and certainly not &quot;ultimate self-direction&quot;. It&#39;s about learning, and that includes learning to live &quot;in the world&quot; - which is different from learning to live in a school and then transitioning to adult life. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s 18. He&#39;s been having a long, slow transition to adult life - and I&#39;ve read similar things from other unschoolers, too. Ronnie Maier had written about her girls back and forth transitions from home to elsewhere:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1\">http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/unschooling-1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to step away from thinking of 18 as some kind of magic number where the kids need to have a plan and be moving forward on that. Ray&#39;s been dabbling with wood and metal working and starting to make money doing that, plus odd jobs, but there&#39;s no goal of &quot;independence by year x&quot;. And really, if he ends up caring for aging parents, or raising children, independence in some kind of &quot;ultimate&quot; sense isn&#39;t a realistic expectation. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: thinking about the future","postDate":"1320384806","msgId":63686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPNl9kUkxhTj1ZVUszZzI4QTRvbTh0V3BSRjQ4N0JGNHpMWFFaTkVQV2FkUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo4djdxaythbWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDVERjlDMTI0LTA4MzItNDc1RS1BODJELUI2QTZBQjY0MzI1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGo4djdxaythbWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63685,"nextInTopic":63687,"prevInTime":63685,"nextInTime":63687,"topicId":63682,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******* When you can explain your point simply and clearly, you will know that you ve really progressed in your understanding of unschooling.

My understanding of saying yes has evolved over time. It comes down to this, for me: don&#39;t be an arbitrary no-sayer (naysayer?). 99%of the time I say no, it&#39;s knee jerk and thoughtless, hence Sandra&#39;s persistent insistence on parenting mindfully, at each moment. It&#39;s actually hard to say no if you take yourself off parenting autopilot and start being in the present moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t say no because my kids are constantly asking to play in traffic, or set the house on fire, or scale the side of the house to our roof! These things are not likely to come up very often :) I say no because I&#39;m too tired or worn down. This means should take better care of myself and not stay up so late. I say know when I am being selfish and lazy because I want to do what I want to do. This means I need to work on being more generous. I say no when a request seems too impractical or fantastical. This means I need to be more flexible and open minded. I say no when I am overwhelmed. This means I need to be breathing deeply and focus on now - not 5 minutes ago when I had to clean up the bathroom floor again, and not 1 hour from now when I will have to figure out what to make for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are nearly 100% dependent on me. This is a unique time of life. To have the person that you are 100% dependent on saying no without thought and consideration is an injustice. To me, it is simply more moral to help them do what they want and need to do than to be a roadblock to those things. I don&#39;t strive to say yes more to &quot;give them freedom&quot; or to help them stay excited about learning, although these may be some of the many by-products of an open, yes-filled optimistic attitude. I strive to say yes because it&#39;s kinder and more helpful and just the right thing to do for people I love and who are so dependent on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my kids grow into independence and have more experience with the world outside of our home, they run into natural, non-arbitrary limits. There are certain places that require certain behaviors out of consideration for others or health or safety. They sometimes stand on our kitchen table at home when playing (the younger ones; our 6 year old has outgrown doing it) but we let them know that it&#39;s not appropriate any where else and wouldn&#39;t allow them to do it at a restaurant or someone else&#39;s hoe If it&#39;s not ok to run and scream when out, then we curb that too, or leave if the boisterousness can&#39;t be contained. I first read the phrase &quot;freedom is not license&quot; in relation to Summerhill several years back and that&#39;s one of my principles: exercising my freedom does not give me license to trample on another&#39;s rights, whether that be a right to safety, or an expectation of peace and quiet, etc. I try to demonstrate that with my kids. I told them once that I wanted to keep my cell phone on during a movie at a theater while I waited for a message, but that I was turning it off because the theater requests it and because the lights and sounds from my phone could be disturbing to <br/>\nothers. There&#39;s a reason behind that &quot;no&quot; at the theater - it&#39;s not arbitrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the &quot;real world&quot; there are plenty of rules and regulations and limitations. They are usually there for a reason. Most people are not raised respectfully and thoughtfully as children and are therefore not always respectful or thoughtful. Not everyone has the same values. Rules and &quot;no&#39;s&quot; in the real world help very different people get along. Even though an individual rule can seem asinine, typically the intent or the larger purpose is to maintain peace and harmony among diverse people.  Even the outside world is free of completely arbitrary roadblocks; so parenting thoughtfully and decreasing arbitrary, or exhausted, or frazzled, or fearful, or thoughtless or selfish no&#39;s from our home lives more closely resembles the rest of the world that you might initially think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read on this list many times about &quot;looking for the yes&quot; when your kid is asking something of you/from you. A great challenge that turns that idea around a bit is to Try to think of a reason to say &quot;no&quot; at a time when you are being very mindful, thoughtful, and in the moment and when you are Not REacting to something. As I said above, it&#39;s actually hard to do, and the answer comes out, more often than not: &quot;sure, why not?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie M<br/>\nJames, 6<br/>\nTyler, 4.25<br/>\nAudrey, 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joy&quot; &lt;joy_bakker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I got the idea of ultimate freedom from the idea of environment manipution - in that we are creating an environment for our children that is joyful and free of some of the more mundane things of life (chores, cooking, self-discipline etc), i.e. in creating this environment of saying yes most of the time (for the purpose of freedom and joy for our children - why else would we say yes most of the time).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But society on the other hand, does not say yes to us all of the time - so how does one transition from an environment of yes most of the time and living in joy most of the time to creating a life that can say yes, can say no, in other words, doesn&#39;t really care .... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: thinking about the future","postDate":"1320365328","msgId":63685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJENjBCM0Q1LTM0MEYtNDJDQy1CRTNELTIyQTU1QjMyRUNBRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo4djdxaythbWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo4djdxaythbWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63684,"nextInTopic":63686,"prevInTime":63684,"nextInTime":63686,"topicId":63682,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Well I got the idea of ultimate freedom from the idea of environment manipution - in that we are creating an environment for our children that is joyful and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1444171268\">-=-Well I got the idea of ultimate freedom from the idea of environment manipution - in that we are creating an environment for our children that is joyful and free of some of the more mundane things of life (chores, cooking, self-discipline etc), i.e. in creating this environment of saying yes most of the time (for the purpose of freedom and joy for our children - why else would we say yes most of the time).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not &quot;manipulating environment.&quot;  It&#39;s allowing them choices, in the moment, and in the next moment if there&#39;s time and it&#39;s safe and all&#39;s well, and in the moment after that, maybe.

I really dislike the idea of &quot;the community&quot; or &quot;tribes.&quot;  Really, it&#39;s a distraction and a problem.   What I did, I did myself, with each of my children, and with my family as a whole, as we got better at it, and I would have done that whether others had been or not.  It wasn&#39;t a &quot;we.&quot;  And it wasn&#39;t for the purpose of freedom or joy.  It was so that they could be in a peaceful and optimal learning environment.

It was a near-constant joy, but that wasn&#39;t why I was saying yes so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a thousand people do these things, it needs to be because each one, separately, of a thousand people, has gradually come to really understand the what and why of unschooling, rather than a vague &quot;how.&quot;  How comes from understanding why.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But society on the other hand, does not say yes to us all of the time - so how does one transition from an environment of yes most of the time and living in joy most of the time to creating a life that can say yes, can say no, in other words, doesn&#39;t really care all that much about us at all.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never asked society for anything.
