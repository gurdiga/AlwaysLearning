This camp is really cool cause the working <br/>\nparent can attend on the weekend, and then go back to work while the <br/>\nother parent and kids can stay through thursday!  THe price is really <br/>\nreasonable, and it&#39;s a good getaway.  If you have any questions, email <br/>\nme.  I highly recommend this camp, the food is great, the people are <br/>\nwonderful, the environment is restfull, the cabins are comfortable (not <br/>\nthe hilton, but nice!) and it&#39;s worth every minute!<br/>\n<br/>\nfor those of you who are not in California, the camp is in the San <br/>\nBernadino mountains, about one hour, 20 minutes (without traffic) from <br/>\nOrange County (disneyland), about the same from LA.  It&#39;s worth a longer <br/>\ndrive, though, and people have come from all over--from Arizona, Utah, <br/>\nNorthern California, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nps, feel free to forward this note on to others! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHoliday Camp for Homeschooling Families<br/>\nat Camp de Benneville Pines<br/>\nSaturday, December 6 - Thursday, December 11, 2003<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease join us for fun in the mountains, fresh air, the smell of pine<br/>\ntrees, old and new homeschooling friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nDe Benneville offers wonderful food and warm cabins.
