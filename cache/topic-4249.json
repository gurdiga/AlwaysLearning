There are 7 of us and we all have many<br/>\nand diverse interests.  About the only time all of us are home together is<br/>\nduring dinner.  It isn&#39;t a formal thing (other than trying to convince the 3<br/>\nyo to ask for things to be passed rather than to climb on to the table to<br/>\nhelp himself).  We have running jokes (like how many minutes it will take<br/>\nsomeone to mention a bodily function--one of grandma&#39;s pet peeves).  The<br/>\nkids don&#39;t seem to feel coerced about it (it is like a stampede when the 2yo<br/>\nhollers &quot;Time E-e-e-a-a-at.&quot;)  When each is done, they wander off, back to<br/>\nwhat they were doing before.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do almost all of our eating at the kitchen table.  Numerous spills,<br/>\nruined carpets, etc. have given us a lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4246,"nextTopicId":4267}}
