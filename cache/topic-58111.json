There seems to <br/>\nbe a deeply ingrained belief that children are innately &quot;out to get us&quot;, <br/>\n&quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;little monsters&quot;, etc., which then seems to make acceptable the <br/>\nsort of down-talking, kid-bashing you experienced.  To say that it makes me very <br/>\nsad and confused is an understatement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have twin boys (who will turn 1 this Thursday) and a 4.5yo daughter.  When <br/>\npeople see us, very often the first response is, &quot;Wow&quot; or a look of amazement.  <br/>\nAfter that, though, the negative, mama-martyring, child-bashing comments <br/>\ndisguised as support begin: &quot;My, my...you have your hands full&quot;, &quot;ooh, double <br/>\ntrouble, huh?&quot;, &quot;two boys, watch out!&quot;, &quot;oh, big sister.  I bet *she&#39;s* a big <br/>\nhelp, huh. hehehehe&quot;, &quot;wow, super mom; you make my situation look easy&quot;, &quot;and I <br/>\nthought my life was hard&quot;, etc. etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets so painfully old to hear these comments, but I also feel so irritated <br/>\nand sad for children in general as well as the poor parents who literally feel <br/>\nso frustrated by their lives and blame that on their children.  I aim to be <br/>\ncompassionate, understanding that these comments have more to do with the people <br/>\nsaying them than with my children or me, but I also aim to convey the happiness <br/>\nand heart-bursting love that I genuinely feel for my children, my family and <br/>\nmyself.  So, like you, I focus on positive comments in return: &quot;yes, I am quite <br/>\na lucky mama&quot;, &quot;she is a big help to me&quot;, &quot;they are delightful&quot;, &quot;we have been <br/>\nblessed&quot;, etc etc.  Usually, these statments shut the comments down rather than <br/>\nencourage a more open, honest, positive conversation about being a parent as I <br/>\nwould some times like to have.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even when I am having a challenging day, I really work on appearing content <br/>\nif not happy, smiling and looking people in the eyes, kissing my children often, <br/>\nspeaking to them, involving them in the work we are doing, etc.  At the very <br/>\nleast I feel that being a beacon of positivity will give my children and I a <br/>\ntrue sense of well being; if beyond that a few parents or non-parents feel <br/>\ngood/better/more positive about children and parenting as result of seeing my <br/>\nfamily or speaking with me briefly about twins or children in general, then <br/>\ngreat! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, having two baby/almost toddler boys is amazing and amazingly exhausting.  <br/>\nAdd to that a very spirited 4 year old girl and what an awesome experience I get <br/>\nto have!  I think I may have written that the boys were almost 1yo and next to <br/>\nthat the word YIKES! I would like to clarify that I am shocked that they are <br/>\nalready a year old as it seems like they were just born... thus the YIKES!

One mom expressed some frustration at not being able to understand what her not-yet-talking two year old wanted.  Another mom quickly jumped in with &quot;Oh, definitely!  I would take a newborn over a toddler any day!&quot;  And someone else said, &quot;I would take a MILLION newborns over a toddler!&quot;  And then others with &quot;Well, I would take a toddler over a 4 year old!&quot;  And so on about how children keep getting more horrible as they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was shocked!  So I said, &quot;I like toddlers.  My daughter was 2 when my son was born, and she was so sweet to him.&quot;  The mom next to me scoffed and said &quot;Sweet!?!  I would NEVER use that word to describe my daughter!  I would use words like &#39;hellion&#39; or &#39;monster&#39;!&quot;  Everyone seemed to think it was funny but I was horrified.  I couldn&#39;t imagine saying that about another person, especially my own children.

So many of the moms were enjoying the kid-bashing that my comments about how kids are great seemed to be drowned out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems something positive did come out of this though, because later at home I talked to my husband about it.  He has a habit of saying negative things about our children when he is angry, like that they are &#39;babies&#39; or &#39;stupid&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;naughty.&#39;  We didn&#39;t really talk about him or how he says those things - just about the La Leche League moms and how many of the kids were in the room and could hear what their parents were saying.  The cool thing is that I have noticed that since our conversation about how badly I felt to hear others talk about kids in such a negative way, he is really trying to change the way he talks about our kids when he is frustrated with them.  And I didn&#39;t nag or lecture him about it, but that he realized he didn&#39;t like how he sounded and decided to try to be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58094,"nextTopicId":56976}}
