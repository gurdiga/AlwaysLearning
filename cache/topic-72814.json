It was cake time, and the dad asked &quot;Who wants cake?&quot;  A chorus of enthusiastic yeses followed.  Hidden in those yeses were some clues too.  One little girl screamed her yes.  She *really* wanted cake.  Another child looked at the cake in a way that seemed to be evaluating whether it would be a flavour he really liked.  My son said he only wanted a small piece.  I didn&#39;t actually want any, but I wanted to participate in the celebration, so a very small piece would have been perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we all sang Happy Birthday, the dad counted heads and cut the cake into that many evenly sized slices.  I thought that was a good idea, except the slice I received was a bit too big for me.  Ethan&#39;s too.  The one boy decided he didn&#39;t care for that flavour of cake, and barely ate any.  The little girl who screamed her yes gobbled hers up and wanted more.  She was very unhappy there wasn&#39;t more.  I offered the rest of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took what I had learned from observing that dynamic, and at Ethan&#39;s birthday recently, when I asked &quot;Who wants cake?&quot; I paid attention to the clues in their responses.  One girl had been hovering around the cake since she arrived to our house.  I would have had to be blind not to know that she wanted a good sized slice.  One boy wasn&#39;t sure if he liked chocolate cake.  One parent didn&#39;t want any.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the plates were aimed in my direction, I looked at each child and asked &quot;How big?  This big?&quot;  The responses ranged from &quot;yes, that big&quot;, to &quot;a bit more&quot;, to &quot;very thin&quot;...and then &quot;a wee bit more&quot;.  There was some left over to share again later.  Those second pieces needed to be much thinner so that everyone got another taste.  The girl who had been eyeing the cake since she arrived got to lick the platter.  She seemed very satisfied with that.  Ethan wanted more too.  I told him I would bake another for him the following day.  Next year I might make two cakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just about birthday cakes, but I think it can apply to everyday negotiations as well.  Understand what you have to offer.  Listen to the clues your children are giving you.  Allow those clues to influence how you navigate everyone&#39;s needs.  It may not always work out perfectly.  Someone may be left wanting more.  Make it up when you can.  Most importantly, show each individual child that you care about what they need, and help them understand and trust that you will do your best to take care of those needs in the context of your full and rich family life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] family of six","postDate":"1386848966","msgId":72832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0ODhDMzQ4LUJFNzItNEY4OC05MDMyLTZBQjM1QUU3NzlFQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzODY4MDY3MjkuMzEyMzAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwMS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzODY3OTQ2NDYuMzU0OTEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDwyQUY4RUUxMC1GNkZFLTQ3MTgtOTU1Qy0zNUU3RTNFQzJENThAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwxMzg2ODA2NzI5LjMxMjMwLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjYxMDEubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72831,"nextInTopic":72833,"prevInTime":72831,"nextInTime":72833,"topicId":72814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

children, I certainly had more time to devote to each child individually.  But I find that there is a flow to the day that almost always happens beautifully where I can move from one child to the next without having children crying for their turn with mommy.  There is a hierarchy that happens naturally where the youngest child almost always needs and wants more of my direct attention, and I typically defer to his requests first.  At the end of the day, I often wish I could have had more time with my 13 year old or my 10 year old.  But they are both happy kids, and right now they are SO occupied with running Minecraft Servers (13year old) and studying prankster videos (10 year old), that they often don&#39;t want to even take a break to discuss what they are doing with me when I walk in their rooms to check in.  And of course there is an ebb and flow, and I always have more opportunity to interact with them as their focus pulls away a bit.  <br>\n\n\n<br></div>The beautiful gift of having 4 children at home together is constantly available playmates.  Right now, my 3 and 5 years spend many hours playing Superman/Batman intensely together.  They pack up backpacks, build forts, head to head planning their next adventure.  And I marvel at how lucky they are to have each other!  And the fact that they do have each other and get so absorbed in their play at times frees me up to go hang out with the older boys. <br>\n\n\n<br></div>Yes, it is true that if I had just two children, then I would be hanging out with my older boys all day long rather than just dropping in with some food and looking at what they are doing.  And so yes, it is harder to spend as much time as I would love to with them.  The question I revisit a lot at night is, am I doing enough?  I know I could be doing more.  But my oldest son just hyperfocuses on one love at a time.  And Minecraft is SO deep, and he is constantly Skyping with people from all over the world, so he is in his room on his computer chatting with his friends all day.  He almost never takes me up on invitations to join in on a game, or listen to a story, or whatever else we are doing.  He is choosing to be doing what he is doing.  I wish I could be more of a part of it- and I think I could contribute more ideas and more enrichment.  Sometimes I do wonder if I just have TOO many kids to unschool really well.  Yes, my oldest son would have a different unschooling experience if he had my undivided attention.  But he would also have missed out on years of fun with his brothers, and years of learning interpersonal skills by learning to interact in a positive way with his brothers. <br>\n\n<br></div>So, this doesn&#39;t answer your question, but it does give you a little window into my family and probably does give support to your concerns.  However, I really do feel that unschooling is still by far the best choice for each of my children.  I am with them, available to them still more than a teacher with 25 students could ever be!  And they are choosing what they do with their time which just can&#39;t happen in a school.<br>\n\n<br></div>Warmly,<br></div>Ali<br><div><div><div><br><br><div

If you expect your older kids to cheerfully pitch in and help out if you no longer require them to do so, unschooling may seem very difficult. If you expect that by being sweeter and nicer you&#39;ll never have arguments to settle between kids, unschooling may seem impossible ;) When people live together, there are things to work out. When people living together have different temperaments and different needs, things are more complicated. And they&#39;ll be more complicated no matter how you parent - rather than trying to compare your family to other unschooling families, it may be more helpful to consider the differences Within your family.

The next three paragraphs are Schuyler&#39;s words:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other arenas in which unschooling preceded scientific understanding of the human condition. In the arena of economic theory, unschooling is quite sophisticated. Not only does it carry at its core the understanding that a good made rare is a good made desirable, buit also understands that how to share something among people is not necessarily to break it into equal portions. In the February 2007 issue of Scientific American there is a review of a paper called “Better Ways to Cut a Cake” that was in the December issue of Notices of the American Mathematical Society. The paper is about how dividing something equally between two people isn’t always about cutting it in half. It is about how the value of different parts of the thing may appeal to the two people in different ways. So, if I baked a carrot cake, Simon would prefer the bits that didn’t have icing on it and would be happy with way less than a half if it were the only bits that I’d remembered not to frost. On unschooling e-mail lists this argument is put forward with great frequency. You don’t have to give your children the same things, or equal amounts of something, you need to give them what they want, help them enjoy the life they want to have and not try and make them be satisfied with those goods that are equally divided between however many you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exciting thing about unschooling though is that it isn’t just the person dividing the cake who gets to make the decisions about how it will be cut. Yesterday we went to a fair with some friends. While we were there Linnaea bought a pair of earrings and a stuffed toy cat. Simon didn’t buy anything. I offered him a bracelet made up of skulls and a couple of other things, but he didn’t feel any need to get something equal to the money that Linnaea spent. Robert Trivers’ probably wouldn’t have predicted that, but unschooling does. Creating a rich and varied life means that there isn’t the neediness, or the poorness of fit that can occur in a life of dividing things equally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our lives unschooling has also created a family where how the cake is divided is often about being able to give the best piece to someone else. Both Simon and Linnaea are intensely generous people. They take great joy in sharing their pleasure, their favorite things with others including each other. They have both sacrificed their first choice to the other, without pressure, without even having it mentioned by David or me. On a cold afternoon when we’d been out biking, Simon gave his hot chocolate to Linnaea as it was the kind she preferred. Or when Linnaea let Simon play the new video game first, even though she’d wanted it so, saying that she’d gain so much from watching him play it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schuyler/stairs.html\">http://sandradodd.com/schuyler/stairs.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":360440773,"authorName":"Greg and Kirsty Harriman","from":"&quot;Greg and Kirsty Harriman&quot; &lt;kgharriman1@...&gt;","profile":"kirsty_harriman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] family of six","postDate":"1386806937","msgId":72827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMkVCRkJDNDU1RTQxRUU5NzFEN0Y5REE2RDg5Q0Y0QEhhcnJpbWFuPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzODY3OTQ2NDYuMzU0OTEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"IDwxMzg2Nzk0NjQ2LjM1NDkxLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjYxMDIubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72826,"nextInTopic":72828,"prevInTime":72826,"nextInTime":72828,"topicId":72814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HI Kristen we are a family of six and just started more seriously on this radical unschooling path.
