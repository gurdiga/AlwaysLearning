I got soft serve vanilla ice cream with strawberry topping and  <br/>\nI ate it for breakfast.  Why?  When I was a child I asked once if I  <br/>\ncould have ice cream for breakfast, and my mother said, �You can have  <br/>\nice cream for breakfast when you�re 21.�  And so I did.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the first paragraph of some writing about a man whose father  <br/>\nwas in a German prisoner-of-war camp.  That part is not about  <br/>\nunschooling, though it is largely about food, and has some limitation  <br/>\nof TV...  it&#39;s of slight interest,  unschoolingwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I wanted to remind people of was that freedom is relative,  <br/>\nand desires shouldn&#39;t be discounted just because it could be worse.   <br/>\nThe parents might have thought &quot;at least he&#39;s not a prisoner of war.&quot;   <br/>\nBut it wouldn&#39;t have hurt to have let him have some ice cream in  <br/>\nchildhood instead of putting it in his mind for over a decade that  <br/>\nwhen he was 21 he could have ice cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure the mother thought it was for his own good.  Alice Miller  <br/>\nstudied Hitler and other WWII German leaders.  They were raised  <br/>\nharshly, for their own good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome great excerpts from the book are here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nospank.net/fyog.htm\">http://www.nospank.net/fyog.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(links at the bottom)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46904,"nextTopicId":46893}}
