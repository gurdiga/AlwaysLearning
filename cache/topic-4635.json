The last time he made a &quot;cake&quot; I asked him if he wanted to look at some cake recipes to get an idea of the basic ingredients. He declined and proceeded to bake a very strange concoction that I didn&#39;t really enjoy. His siblings however thought it very tasty.<br/>\nI tried to critique it with very detailed words &quot;it&#39;s a little bit dry, but very sweet&quot; etc.....<br/>\nI also offered the cake recipes for reference again so he could try and figure out how to fix what he didn&#39;t like about his recipe....he declined once again.<br/>\nI say offer the info. and let them go! She might like it just the way it is. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell my son that the cake mix DID have flour in it, but he&#39;d probably respond with something about trying to thicken it up. LOL<br/>\nHave info. available to her and offer it. If she doesn&#39;t want it then let her run with it and be supportive. It may turn out wonderful. My sis has a really incredible cake recipe that starts with a boxed mix and adds a bunch of other stuff to it.

If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;advocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>\n&gt;my six year old?  Either way I let him decide that he would speak for<br/>\n&gt;himself with me standing right behind him.  The next week he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt;go for the same reason he didn&#39;t want to go that week (he didn&#39;t want to sit<br/>\n&gt;in the same place), so I didn&#39;t make him go.  This week he didn&#39;t want to go<br/>\n&gt;again and it was the last class so I didn&#39;t make him go.... I&#39;m not signing<br/>\n&gt;him up for anymore classes unless he really wants them, but that would be<br/>\n&gt;part of learning about the unschooling process.  If this is a list for only<br/>\n&gt;seasoned radical unschoolers I was unaware of that.  Because I disagree with<br/>\n&gt;&quot;the leader&quot; does not mean I&#39;m wrong for my family.  There are no<br/>\n&gt;authorities on unschooling.... Isn&#39;t that the whole point, that we each have<br/>\n&gt;deal with our children the way that feels comfortable for our child and<br/>\n&gt;learn what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have not been responding to many of the posts because I feel that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to get into a &quot;war of words&quot;, who can say things &quot;the best&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;&quot;correctly&quot; so I&#39;ll go back to lurking, like many others and then when<br/>\n&gt;someone says something I disagree with I&#39;ll just think it rather than bring<br/>\n&gt;it up.  That way it&#39;s safer than having the whole of what I said pulled<br/>\n&gt;apart.

Cacie could see why the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;other girl would say this, it made some sense to level the field.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; A good coach would be politely asking the ref why they weren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;&gt; calling  those penalties.  When refs let that stuff go, they&#39;re just<br/>\n&gt;asking <br/>\n&gt;&gt; for a rougher game.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think Cacie&#39;s coach is wonderful, and I think she&#39;s been lucky in<br/>\n&gt;soccer to have two very gentle, nurturing head coaches (and both<br/>\n&gt;assistant coaches have been good guys too, the one this year is a college<br/>\n&gt;soccer player). Generally, in both of the leagues we&#39;ve played it, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;considered very bad form to contradict a referee&#39;s call or tell a ref<br/>\n&gt;what calls to make, and I agree with that policy. It&#39;s a hard job, and<br/>\n&gt;some of the refs are only 9 or 10 years old. They don&#39;t need someone<br/>\n&gt;second-guessing their calls, even in a nice way. They can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt;everything. I know this coach has very respectfully spoken to the field<br/>\n&gt;ref a couple of times after a game, about some calls, but I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s appropriate during a game. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The refs also seem to get better as the kids get older... Cacie plays on<br/>\n&gt;a U9 and a U10 team, so the kids are  pretty young, and they tend to be<br/>\n&gt;more thoughtless than vicious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;But you can tell Cacie that the refs almost always  see the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; retaliation, and will usually call the penalty on the person who <br/>\n&gt;&gt; retaliated.  So that strategy would end up hurting her team.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think they meant to retaliate, just to use the same tactics,<br/>\n&gt;like, &quot;If someone from the other team is racing you for the ball, elbow<br/>\n&gt;her out of the way, since that&#39;s what they alwsys do to us.&quot; Things like<br/>\n&gt;that. The girl who had the idea is probably the most competitive kid on<br/>\n&gt;the team, she and Cacie have argued before. Actually, this girl has<br/>\n&gt;argued with a good number of the other girls. I had gone to my car so I<br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t there when she and Cacie first got into it, but when I arrived<br/>\n&gt;Cacie was in tears and there were three or four girls at her side<br/>\n&gt;supporting her and telling her that G. has &quot;yelled at&quot; them, too. The<br/>\n&gt;coach also hadled that nicely...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The game today was a very fairly-played 1-1 tie....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tia, the sports-hating sports mum <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;:-) I like sports.

Where Sandra say you were doing something wrong for your family? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The way I saw it, she was speaking to the comment that a 6 year old could be &quot;expected&quot; to deal with an adult.   I imagine that thought set an idea in Sandra&#39;s head that she felt would benefit many of us.  If you had a notion that you were trying to toughen your son up by making him stand up to the teacher, you may have read what Sandra said and thought about it a little.  The rest of us got to think about this idea as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You clarified that you were not trying to toughen up your little guy but did want him to feel he could question all people no matter their age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a previous post, I *disagreed* with the concept that having family dinners was controlling.  After hearing my reasons, no one said they went against unschooling.  If they had I would have taken a harder look.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At another time, I explained how we handle food choices in our home.   My ideas were challenged and I gained some new insight.

It&#39;s something  for all of us to<br/>\n&gt;think about; do we advocate for our (less experienced, more easily<br/>\n&gt;intimidated)  kids with people of authority?

Reading<br/>\n&gt;her book also helped me get over some of my own food hang-ups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pudginess before a growth spurt is normal for children, with some getting<br/>\n&gt;more pudge than others.  Although extreme overweight is a risk factor for<br/>\n&gt;several common American diseases, there are also skinny people having<br/>\n&gt;heart attacks, strokes, or other health problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, now I remember the other book I read that dealt with this issue! <br/>\n&gt;Mother Dance, by Harriet Lerner.  She is a psychologist.  I found the<br/>\n&gt;book hilarious and insightful on the issue of motherhood.  One of her<br/>\n&gt;chapters deals with food and she tells of her own experience with<br/>\n&gt;&quot;de-controlling&quot; her sons&#39; eating.  Very interesting.  At one point her<br/>\n&gt;son ended up sneaking grapes at a buffet bc the parents were boycotting<br/>\n&gt;something that had to do with grape-growing industry and would not allow<br/>\n&gt;grapes in the house.  Sneaking food has more to do with control than with<br/>\n&gt;whether the food is &quot;healthy&quot; or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Sun, 10 Feb 2002 20:17:10 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;   From: Sharon Rudd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearspawprint@...\">bearspawprint@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re:  Too many sweets<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sneaking food has more to do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with control than with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; whether the food is &quot;healthy&quot; or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lots of food issues are control issues rather than<br/>\n&gt;what they superficially appear to be.

Cover with<br/>\n&gt;water in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>\n&gt;of vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>\n&gt;traditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>\n&gt;canola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>\n&gt;sugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>\n&gt;honey would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>\n&gt;all together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>\n&gt;are how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>\n&gt;vinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>\n&gt;crumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>\n&gt;Seminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>\n&gt;it)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>\n&gt;brothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>\n&gt;overs can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>\n&gt;heated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>\n&gt;pot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>\n&gt;Collards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>\n&gt;iron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>\n&gt;folks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>\n&gt;brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>\n&gt;other good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>\n&gt;K and ????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Adrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>\n&gt;willing to try new foods. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sharon of the Swamp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;his salads are tasty and interesting&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Must get it from his Mama.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have tried and tried to recreate your greens<br/>\n&gt;&gt; recipe.
