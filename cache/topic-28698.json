Violated? Crikey. <br/>\nWhat kind of word is that to use? So I wrote back informing the lady <br/>\nthat I was leaving the group anyway. Or words to that effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel myself that it&#39;s our personal stories - of which our <br/>\nchildren are a part - and our actual experiences of unschooling that <br/>\nmatter more than analysing unschooling in itself as if we&#39;re back in <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m more than happy to talk about my private life.
