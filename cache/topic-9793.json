My mom, who has been fighting cancer for almost <br/>\nsix years, and doing very well, has been in the hospital for several weeks. <br/>\nThe cancer had spread to her brain, and she has lost most of the use of her <br/>\nleft side. Unfortunately, the radiation is not working, and she may be too <br/>\nweak for the chemo that&#39;s been keeping her alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has decided (as of now) to cease treatment, leave the hospital, and begin <br/>\nhospice. We will head down to Florida, where she will be at my sister&#39;s <br/>\nhouse, after the conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will probably be staying, although Julian and Beth will head back north at <br/>\nthe end of the week. I think I will stay to help as long as I am needed. The <br/>\nidea of being away from my family, and especially Julian, for a long time is <br/>\nexcruciating, but it feels like the right thing to do. I have already <br/>\narranged with my work (at a Unitarian Universalist church) to be away as long <br/>\nas I need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to meeting a bunch of you this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9741,"nextTopicId":9809}}
