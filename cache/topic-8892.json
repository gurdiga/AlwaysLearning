What kind of games do they want to play?&quot; so I<br/>\nasked if you can categorize what kind of games go with each console.

The game and the console. Here in southern California Blockbuster<br/>\nrents them. This way you get to take take them home and pretend you just<br/>\nspent a lot of money on the purchase and see if it was worthwhile. You also<br/>\nhave the ability to look at the game racks knowing that only the games for<br/>\n&quot;your&quot; one console are available to you.
