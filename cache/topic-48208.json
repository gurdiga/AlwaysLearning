Here&#39;s a really sweet one.  I&#39;ll let it  <br/>\nrepresent the others:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;m behind on emails and new to this group, but just have to shout  <br/>\nout a big THANK YOU for all these great ideas!!!  Wow, they rock!   <br/>\nSome are just little things I haven&#39;t thought of for a while.  I made  <br/>\na list to save!<br/>\nThanks a bunch!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is big and busy.  Each and every time anyone posts, please  <br/>\nlet it be a question about unschooling, a suggestion or a personal  <br/>\nstory, or something interesting about unschooling that will help MANY  <br/>\npeople on the list--dozens or hundreds.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us all continue to assume that the ideas are good and that people  <br/>\nwho get good ideas are grateful and will think about them.   It&#39;s not  <br/>\nrude not to write to a thousand people and say &quot;thanks!&quot;  I don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto be returning so many posts.  So if anyone wants to say LOL or Me  <br/>\ntoo! or Good idea or Thanks, then you need to wrap that up in a good  <br/>\nstory about how it helped you at your house, or something your kids  <br/>\nhave done lately that might not have done if not for unschooling.    <br/>\nSomething substantial and useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, others, don&#39;t write and say &quot;thanks for writing that.  I  <br/>\nagree.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThink your gratitude, and take that warm feeling and do something nice  <br/>\nfor someone at your house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48204,"nextTopicId":48203}}
