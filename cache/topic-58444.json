Things I can&#39;t even control (the weather mostly...). :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when people get here, we talk and play games and eat, and the state of the corners and the dust on the bookshelves has never sent anyone away prematurely.  And seriously, if someone came and said &quot;I cannot possibly sit and talk and play games with you, because I can see some dust bunnies from here,&quot; then that would mean they didn&#39;t care about what I care about, or that I wasn&#39;t interesting enough for them.   If I spent a lot of time cleaning and people came over to talk and play games, they probably wouldn&#39;t take time to look around and think, &quot;How clean this house is!  I am very impressed.&quot;   [Unless they knew me well, and might notice it was exceptionally clean, for a Sandra house.]<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, it&#39;s a service to others who visit, to go home and feel wonderfully good about their own organization and housekeeping after they&#39;ve visited me!
