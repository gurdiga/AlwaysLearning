We bought him a plastic tool set to <br/>\nkeep him occupied while he was convalescing.  (Yeah, right.)  He was much <br/>\nhappier with our battery powered screwdriver.  He was especially jazzed by <br/>\nflipping the switch that reversed the direction of the driver allowing him <br/>\nto screw and unscrew into an old board to his heart&#39;s content.  Which he <br/>\ndid.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  Over and over and over...<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that year Grandpa visited and was horrified by the fact that Jared <br/>\nstood on a chair at the counter, sink, stove - wherever we were working - so <br/>\nhe could be involved.  Grandpa went right out and bought him a Fisher-Price <br/>\nkitchen.  For safety, you know.  Jared loved that, too.  But only until he <br/>\nwas finished putting it together with the REAL screws and tools! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s twelve.  Last summer at the HSC conference he spent the whole time <br/>\ndoing &#39;real&#39; work behind the scenes rather than attending the kids&#39; program. <br/>\n  He was in his glory on the loading dock carrying boxes for vendors, <br/>\nstuffing literature bags, staying up late to tape off the exhibitor booths, <br/>\ncarrying the clipboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all good news for parents, grandparents, and other gift-givers, of <br/>\ncourse.  Think of the money that can be saved by NOT buying all those <br/>\ncutesie, plastic, *just-like-the-real-thing* toys.
