Son (10) was moping around bored while dad was playing a videogame.  Apparently, because dad has been so tired lately, son was (considerately) thinking that &quot;he shouldn&#39;t bother him.&quot;  I already knew that my son was very considerate when his dad was napping, but didn&#39;t think about him exerting himself to be considerate and (ow) self-effacing when his dad was awake.

Because I started to worry about how little time we spent together (dad being greatly preferred when available), I got a little clearer in my priorities.

Put the big ones in first.   (Summary  of long, <br/>\nartsy story.  Apologies to the anonymous author for  that.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a priorities deal.  And different days can have different  priorities. <br/>\nLife&#39;s not homogenous, but if we keep concentrating on the little  stuff, <br/>\nthere&#39;s no hole big enough for the big stuff.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBig stuff first,and for me my big thing until my kids are grown is the  kids. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeasonally, I&#39;ll have some other &quot;big thing.&quot;  If  a friend has an emergency <br/>\nneed and I spend time with her,  my kids  understand. They know I&#39;ll get back <br/>\nto them.<br/>\n <br/>\nLately I am a failure to finish Kirby&#39;s shower.  I&#39;m up to the  grout-sealing <br/>\nand teensy detail stuff.  I should just go and do that.   Really.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I try to do something special or particular with each kid each day if I  <br/>\ncan.  Yesterday I made sure Marty&#39;s favorite clothes were clean and  delivered, <br/>\nand I made a fancy hog-dog buffet (lots of toppings, chili in a  crock-pot, <br/>\nlots of chips, plates and napkins out...) for his role-playing game  guys.   I <br/>\nwatched the episodes of 24 we had taped, with Kirby, for  four hours.  Holly <br/>\nand I hung out and talked about games and computers and  how she feels about <br/>\nher brothers (positive conversation this time) and I felt  her hair.  She likes <br/>\npeople to mess with her hair, so I stroked it and  admired it, and I rubbed <br/>\nher head where the really short hair is in back.   I think it kind of tickles <br/>\nher, and it feels good to have a little head  massage.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t big-deal stuff, but I wanted them to go to sleep feeling that it  <br/>\nwas a good day.  And I had the good-day feeling too.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh!  And I had heated up the hot tub (my favorite toy for many years,  a <br/>\nwood-fired hot-tub we got in December) for Keith, so he could get in when he  got <br/>\nback from work.  I was happy, having shut the stove up when it reached  104 <br/>\ndegree.  Ooops, though... when he got home it was 110, and it had to  cool down <br/>\nbefore he could use it.   Still, he felt good that it was  hot when he came <br/>\nhome, and it made me feel good that he got to soak his arm and  relax (after a <br/>\nfew hours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154422553,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisulam@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: thoughtfulness and generosity","postDate":"1106068300","msgId":21614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMTE4MTcxMTM5LkhHV0wyODAyNS5vdXQwMDEudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRARVBNREVMTD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMDYwNjI5MDAuMTY3Mi40MjMxLm0xMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21615,"prevInTime":21613,"nextInTime":21615,"topicId":21614,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra Said ... because you thought they would enjoy it, and then they did?
