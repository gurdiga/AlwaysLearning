My parents thought it was a<br/>\nwaste of time and let me know it. I continued to watch, but did so at that<br/>\npoint with a bit of shame, because now I thought that what I was doing was<br/>\nirresponsible and bad. But I loved the show! I remember being entranced with<br/>\nthe stereotyped characters (the Howells were the first rich people I had<br/>\never seen, and Ginger, well, gosh, before her I didn&#39;t think anybody really<br/>\ncould have been glamorous like that [or shallow :o)]. So even though they<br/>\nweren&#39;t real people, and I knew that, I did learn a bit about the<br/>\npossibilities...someone could spend their time looking beautiful and<br/>\nmodeling, someone could actually have so much money they paid for people to<br/>\ndo even the simplest of tasks for them. I was really quite enmeshed in that<br/>\nshow, and it was a really important thing for me at the time. I internally<br/>\ngot a lot out of it. If I was forced to go play outside, I probably would<br/>\nhave tried to watch it through a window.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the point is, what is meaningless to you is a separate thing entirely<br/>\nfrom what is meaningful to your children. And if you inflict your negative<br/>\nopinion onto something they love, it will get in the way of your<br/>\nrelationship, and take away an opportunity to enjoy something together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Buthow do you balance what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids first as much as possible.

The reading, the movie-watching, the massage, the conversing on<br/>\nthe phone, really can all wait until my kids aren&#39;t around as much. I do get<br/>\nto do these things on occasion, but I really try to do it around my kids&#39;<br/>\nneeds/wants. My older kids are already starting to be gone more and I do<br/>\nhave much more freedom than ever before in my parenting. Sidenote: my almost<br/>\n17 yo just said yesterday, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m going to college but I&#39;m going to live<br/>\nat home and not build up debt and live with you guys for a long time. Just<br/>\nletting you know.&quot; YES!!!! I SO hope that that is how it turns out, as he is<br/>\njust such a good friend of mine. But I am also ready for him to decide<br/>\notherwise, if he wants, as he gets older.

I took out the &quot;unwilling to change&quot;<br/>\n&gt;because I feel I have now become aware That I do project these<br/>\n&gt;traits and am wanting to change and am actively trying to find ways<br/>\n&gt;to do this. However, it seems like a very long process. My ds has<br/>\n&gt;just turned 12, does he have time as for me to go through this<br/>\n&gt;process? I see the same type of reactions in him. His biological<br/>\n&gt;father was a angry, critical person too. Am I doing more damage than<br/>\n&gt;good trying to unschool him while I work on these issues I have?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more concerned about their own mothers&#39; opinions than about being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their children&#39;s best mother<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  this one i have recently gotten over. I think that&#39;s progress. I<br/>\n&gt;just gave her the links to several unschooling websites and told her<br/>\n&gt;this is what we are doing. I have defended homeschooling so much to<br/>\n&gt;my extended family,I didn&#39;t want to even think about defending<br/>\n&gt;unschooling. Although, as I read this comment again, I don&#39;t think I<br/>\n&gt;was really concerned about their opinions, just the backlash I had<br/>\n&gt;to deal with because of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the parents consider their children&#39;s interests to<br/>\n&gt;be &quot;stupid,&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At first, I think this described my feeling about some of their<br/>\n&gt;pursuits somewhat. I don&#39;t think &quot;stupid&quot; is the right word though.<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t think of the right word, but I felt, and still do at times,<br/>\n&gt;feel like certain things such as TV and video games don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;have much value. The I thinkabout some of the thing smy DS comes up<br/>\n&gt;with and when I ask &quot;where did you learn that&quot; his answer is<br/>\n&gt;discovery kids or somethign similar. DD, however, only watches<br/>\n&gt;disney or charmed. I think this is where I am truly wonderign about<br/>\n&gt;the value. The she will come up with some tidbit of info that seem<br/>\n&gt;valuable that was gleened forn one of these shows. It&#39;s a constant<br/>\n&gt;internal conflict of mine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Children learn from things they feel happy and good and hopeful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do think my angry,, critical nature has definately affected this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From other things, they learn to stop trusting, stop trying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoid learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I tried to be so open with my DS and DD. hoping that they would grow<br/>\n&gt;up to be able to trust in me and come to me wit whatever they needed<br/>\n&gt;to. I hav recently discovered that my DS fells like he can&#39;t tell me<br/>\n&gt;anything or he&#39;ll &quot;get in trouble&quot;. I dont feel like he is avoiding<br/>\n&gt;learning though. He does like to come show me his creations and<br/>\n&gt;things he has found that interest him. He has said that he is glad<br/>\n&gt;he can coem to me and share his interestes. I guess it is realy the<br/>\n&gt;negative feelings that he feels he can not share with me or &quot;he&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;get in trouble&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-How can a person fail at unschooling? Is it so hard?-=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s harder to fail than to succeed.  People do it all the time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They say &quot;We used to unschool&quot; but when pressed for details, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes no more than one semester they quit their curriculum<br/>\n&gt;early,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or they used to only require math and reading, but that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working so they went back to a curriculum.  There are people who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;give it a try&quot; for a month and decide it didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, we&#39;ve been homeschoolign for 3 years. when we first started I<br/>\n&gt;had a mish-mosh of different shoolish books. Lasted for 3 weeks.<br/>\n&gt;Then I found out about unschooling. The beginning of this &quot;school&quot;<br/>\n&gt;year I got panicky. My DS doesn&#39;t know the math that school kids<br/>\n&gt;know. I hear about this all the time from my Grandmother, teacher<br/>\n&gt;for 60 years.  So we tried a Charlotte mason approach. Taht lasted<br/>\n&gt;until november. We were liking all the reading, then we moved and<br/>\n&gt;haven&#39;t started reading again. They didn&#39;t like some of the other<br/>\n&gt;aspects of it and we haven&#39;t gone back. We are out in the country<br/>\n&gt;and the kids  are really liking exploring and playing outside. I do<br/>\n&gt;think we would all liketo go back to doign soemof the reading<br/>\n&gt;though. DD still spells phonetically. She would be in 4th grade this<br/>\n&gt;year. This does bother her, so I am trying to help out by strewing<br/>\n&gt;spelling type things. We have recently gotten Boggle and she has<br/>\n&gt;jsut gotten an internet pen pal. Both of these she likes, but seems<br/>\n&gt;to give up so easily because of her spelling skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people who are unwilling to even look into the idea of<br/>\n&gt;deschooling,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think we have been doing this for 3 years and it is still ongoing.<br/>\n&gt;Does it really take this long and longer?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so they walk around with an emergency-option school on their<br/>\n&gt;backs,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and in their heads.  They live in the shadow of school.  They<br/>\n&gt;compare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything their kids do or don&#39;t do to an idealized vision of<br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the child would do if he were in school, or to a theoretical model<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the ideal school kid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are constantly hearing concerns from extended family so this is<br/>\n&gt;in the back of my head. I usually don&#39;t think about it unless<br/>\n&gt;someone else brings it up, which is often. This is one of the<br/>\n&gt;reasons I think we are still deschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-If not everyone can do it, then does that mean that some who<br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are unschooling are actually not and thus potentially<br/>\n&gt;harming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their children?-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So am I one of the ones that just thinks I am unschooling, but am<br/>\n&gt;really just pretending and doing more harm than good?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the children are unhappy, and the parents aren&#39;t thinking of<br/>\n&gt;fun,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; creative, surprising and interesting things to do, the kids might<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better off in school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I am getting better at this. I am sitting down to play more<br/>\n&gt;games with them. I have finally decided we waste enough money on<br/>\n&gt;other thigns, I should just go ahead and let them do the activities<br/>\n&gt;I have said no to in the past because i felt like we didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt;money. So  dd is taking cooking classes and Ice skating and LOVING<br/>\n&gt;both of them.  Ds is in Boy Scouts and does every activity they come<br/>\n&gt;up with. I feel liek we should get out more. I know they would like<br/>\n&gt;to go to park day with our homeschool group more. And there is a<br/>\n&gt;coop that they liek to go to on fridays. Buthow do you balance what<br/>\n&gt;the kids want to do with what you need/want to do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  School potentially harms people.  If the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents can do better than school in so many ways that the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really would rather be home doing cooler things, then the parents<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably can unschool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what if they watch &quot;Charmed&quot; all day? Is that better or cooler<br/>\n&gt;than being in school? I can say that when asked, they do not want to<br/>\n&gt;go back to school. DS has, however, said he woudl like to try middle<br/>\n&gt;school for a year, but changes his mind when he realizes he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;know the same schoolish things that they do (i.e. mulitiplication<br/>\n&gt;and division.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;How can we make every single day fun and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memorable?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EVERY single day? Waht about the day to day things that we have to<br/>\n&gt;take time out for such as washing clothes and cooking and fixing<br/>\n&gt;thigns arougn the house? And what about when mom has gone so much<br/>\n&gt;she is exhausted but the kids still want to go?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It would be a disservice to all unschoolers, too, to call neglect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes I think I am being neglectful because I am not requiring<br/>\n&gt;them to do anything.

However, it seems like a very long process. My ds has <br/>\njust turned 12, does he have time as for me to go through this <br/>\nprocess? I see the same type of reactions in him.

I don&#39;t think &quot;stupid&quot; is the right word though. <br/>\nI can&#39;t think of the right word, but I felt, and still do at times, <br/>\nfeel like certain things such as TV and video games don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave much value. The I thinkabout some of the thing smy DS comes up <br/>\nwith and when I ask &quot;where did you learn that&quot; his answer is <br/>\ndiscovery kids or somethign similar. DD, however, only watches <br/>\ndisney or charmed. I think this is where I am truly wonderign about <br/>\nthe value. The she will come up with some tidbit of info that seem <br/>\nvaluable that was gleened forn one of these shows.

He does like to come show me his creations and <br/>\nthings he has found that interest him. He has said that he is glad <br/>\nhe can coem to me and share his interestes.

I hear about this all the time from my Grandmother, teacher <br/>\nfor 60 years.  So we tried a Charlotte mason approach. Taht lasted <br/>\nuntil november. We were liking all the reading, then we moved and <br/>\nhaven&#39;t started reading again. They didn&#39;t like some of the other <br/>\naspects of it and we haven&#39;t gone back. We are out in the country <br/>\nand the kids  are really liking exploring and playing outside. I do <br/>\nthink we would all liketo go back to doign soemof the reading <br/>\nthough. DD still spells phonetically. She would be in 4th grade this <br/>\nyear. This does bother her, so I am trying to help out by strewing <br/>\nspelling type things. We have recently gotten Boggle and she has <br/>\njsut gotten an internet pen pal.

Sandra mentioned in one of her posts to  <br/>\nme something like &quot;It is your JOB to get your daughter to where she  <br/>\nneeds to go.&quot;  Those words struck me right to the heart and I admit I  <br/>\nwas quite depressed for a few days- she was right. I felt terrible  <br/>\nbecause she was right and I realized I had been letting my children  <br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was several months ago and that day I  did a complete  about  <br/>\nface - we now get there a half hour early 4X a week. There is no more  <br/>\nrushing or untidy bun. I can SEE the difference in her attitude- that  <br/>\nI take her desire to be there seriously  and that lifts her spirit  <br/>\nand maintains her self worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I would have gotten that type of advice on another  <br/>\nlist. Maybe it being put so bluntly made me really think about what  <br/>\nwas said more  than I would have if I had to  wade through sugar  <br/>\ncoated opinions to figure out the meaning. Maybe not<br/>\nAt any rate there is a saying &quot;principles before personalities&quot;  <br/>\nmeaning take the principle behind what the person as saying and don�t  <br/>\nlet their personality get in the way of receiving the message.<br/>\n=======================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are MANY other lists where the goal is to sit and write  <br/>\nwhatever comes to mind, to other people who are going to read it  <br/>\nlightly and write whatever comes to mind.  The few lists I&#39;m on that  <br/>\nare that way pretty much bug the crap out of me, because it IS a  <br/>\nwaste of time and energy, but some people like the mindless chit-chat  <br/>\nand the cooing and &quot;support&quot; and camaraderie.  In some cases it can  <br/>\nlead to real friendships, but in more cases it&#39;s fluff and noise.  I  <br/>\nstay because under 20 messages might be one piece of information I  <br/>\nactually needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=--=- I don&#39;t know that I share your zeal for proselytizing  <br/>\nunschooling although I do enjoy sharing and promoting unschooling and  <br/>\nrespectful parenting.<br/>\n-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what I&#39;m doing is sharing and promoting unschooling and  <br/>\nrespectful parenting.  I spend money (I pay for webspace and support  <br/>\nand I got full photobucket so I can upload, store and link graphics  <br/>\nbetter than I could on the website I&#39;m already paying for.  It&#39;s not  <br/>\nhuge amounts of money, and It seems totally worth it to me to have  <br/>\nthings where I can just send people links when they ask.  It&#39;s like  <br/>\nany volunteer work or community service, only I can do it from home  <br/>\nand still be with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...  I think proselytizing is trying to bring everyone into one  <br/>\nfold, and I don&#39;t think unschooling is for everyone.  I think  <br/>\nunschooling is for very few and it&#39;s easy to screw it up.  Some  <br/>\npeople say &quot;Anyone can unschool,&quot; and I&#39;ve never ever heard or read  <br/>\nthose words without thinking (and sometimes saying) &quot;No they can&#39;t.&quot;   <br/>\nAnd some people say &quot;You&#39;ve been unschooling since your baby was  <br/>\nborn!&quot; and that&#39;s nonsense.   Those who like to think there&#39;s nothing  <br/>\nto it are going to take longer to get it going well than those who  <br/>\nactively try to adjust their lives and homes and thinking to get that  <br/>\nlearning flow running, and to get ideas and communications swirling.   <br/>\nI&#39;m willing to help people do that, because it was harder for me to  <br/>\nget going than it needs to be now, with the internet and e-mail  <br/>\nlists.  I like to help make it easier for those who want to do it,  <br/>\nbut I&#39;m not off trying to convert the heathen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27914,"nextTopicId":27920}}
