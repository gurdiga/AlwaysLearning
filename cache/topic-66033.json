Often young children do not have the awareness or ability to wait.  Sometimes even adults interrupt.  It was easier and faster for us to get back to our conversations if we let the person who had to speak go ahead and say or ask what they needed to.  My ten year old especially has so much patience in letting little children speak even if he is in the middle of a conversation.  Patience can develop over time, and it can be helpful if it is modeled (although I think personality plays a part too).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith many people in our household, there have been times when everyone tried to speak to me at once and I explained that I could not hear anyone with everyone talking at the same time.  I&#39;d say something like, &quot;If no one has an emergency (no one was getting hurt or would be hurt if I didn&#39;t hear them first), let&#39;s try to let Kanoa (youngest) say what he needs to say and then let Katie (who was talking first) finish what she was saying.  Then Li and Makana, I will listen to you.  I do want to hear what you have to say too.&quot; (and usually I make physical contact by hugging one of them close or touching their head or something while they are waiting...because it is hard to wait and I think that contact helps sometimes.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280748421,"authorName":"Vanessa Orsborn","from":"Vanessa Orsborn &lt;orangeness1@...&gt;","profile":"orangeness1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling different ages","postDate":"1331625273","msgId":66064,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDNzVERjdELTVBMUYtNDI1Ri1CM0M3LUM0NzdDQTFFNTczMUB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpqbWtkNitkaW9rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpqbWtkNitkaW9rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66060,"nextInTopic":66080,"prevInTime":66063,"nextInTime":66065,"topicId":66033,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Making dens/camps is another :-) Sent from my iPhone ... ...","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1132762863\">Making dens/camps is another :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 13 Mar 2012, at 05:02, &quot;sarah&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Love the suggestions about the trampoline, thanks Meredith.

I was gearing up to ask a similar one myself, but will digest the answers that come from yours. I have five children, girls ages 16, 6, and 11 months, and boys ages 13 and 7. We&#39;ve unschooled curriculum-wise for many years, and a lot life-wise, but it&#39;s only the last few months that I&#39;m coming to better see the beauty when it applies to everything. Working on learning to not overlook the teenagers in the midst of the bustle with little ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nA thought I had for you regarding errands - perhaps take just the 7 year old with you on errands sometime? He probably dislikes errands when little sister tags along, but going with you one-on-one would be much different. When I take my 7 year old by himself (nursing baby has to come, but he likes her), we get a chance to talk and laugh and share and listen (me) much more than when siblings are in the mix. I slow the pace as much as I can. We can stroll aisles he wants to spend time on because other kids aren&#39;t there wanting to get to their aisles. We pick out a pack of gum or candy bar to share, or get a soda, and it&#39;s like we&#39;re dining at the Ritz Carlton. Later during the day/week I whisper in his ear how much I enjoyed being with him, how much I love him, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nGideon also loves for me to read to him. So I will find times when the baby is fed and happy and will have her on the floor playing with something she hasn&#39;t seen in awhile, with Gideon is tucked in my lap. Meribee may crawl up on us now and then, but we generally get a good ten to fifteen minutes of snuggling and reading. Not a lot of time, but it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure to tussle his hair as he runs by during the day, stop and give him a five second hug, thank him for helping me get such and such down from the cabinet, etc. We have a bedtime routine that he instituted and he loves that every night I follow his request to &quot;scratch my back, rub my arms, and run your fingers through my hair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s wonderful that yours have a good relationship with each other.

We had a neighbor who was homeschooled (not unschooled) and she worked for us from the time she was 12 until she was 15, at least two hours a week, and often six or more.  It was great for her.  I paid her $3 an hour when she was young and $6 when she was old enough to babysit without me, or $5 when she was older and I was home.  It might need to be more nowadays, and depending where you are, if you can find someone.  Another idea is to find a playmate for your son, someone (male or female, not necessarily exactly his age) to invite with you when you go to the zoo or a playground or museum.  It will take the pressure off everyone.  We often found that inviting one other child helped everyone get along better, and made the experience different, too, and special.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219096950,"authorName":"sarah","from":"&quot;sarah&quot; &lt;sarah@...&gt;","profile":"saritap1119","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling different ages","postDate":"1331168676","msgId":66033,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqOTBqNCsxMG1uaUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66034,"prevInTime":66032,"nextInTime":66034,"topicId":66033,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi - I have been on the group awhile, been reading about unschooling for longer.

I have 2 kids; a 7yo boy and a 3yo girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding it hard to feel that I&#39;m unschooling.  What I mean is, I want to devote my time and energy to each child equally, but I find that the 3yo is very vocal about having most of my attention.  I know this is normal for a 3yo, but what happens is my 7yo spends a lot of time alone, doing Lego, watching videos, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer to be sitting with him and participating - really sitting with BOTH of them and participating, but the 3yo crawls all over us, and it&#39;s impossible.  My 7yo gets frustrated, my 3yo gets destructive, and I end up having to take her out of the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel really guilty about this. I feel like I am letting him down.  I see what unschooling can be, but I don&#39;t see how to implement it when their needs are so different.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course we have activities that include both of them, like trips to play places, museums, parks, etc.  But it&#39;s at home that I feel like I&#39;m relegating my older child to the back of the bus.  I feel like his life experiences could be SO much richer, if I could give him more time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me feels like they are so young, perhaps I don&#39;t need to worry about it too much, that my 3yo clinger will soon be a 5 or 6yo more independent kid, and then I will be able to devote my time more equally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this is just how it is with more than one kid?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr are there suggestions for more things they can be doing together?  7 and 3 are pretty far apart in terms of interests and abilities, although they do sometimes, occasionally find common ground.  They like to sword fight, play with bubbles, and sometimes play cars.  They get along well emotionally.  They are generally quite good and sweet siblings, they just prefer different activities - but both really wanting me involved.  And I WANT to be involved, I just need to duplicate myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of schedule, my 3yo wakes up first, so she and I read and play until my 7yo gets up.  My 3yo doesn&#39;t nap, so there is no midday break where I might have some good time with my 7yo.  My 3yo goes to bed first, and my 7yo spends time until bedtime doing computer games with his dad.  So there are no natural places in the day where my 7yo and I can be together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought of hiring a sitter to take my daughter out once a week, but I already have sitter 2-3 days a week so that I may work and run errands (the kids hate errands, so I try and do them alone), so I feel a little bad having the 3yo with a sitter for even more time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I wait it out, or are there some some suggestions for games activities we can all do together?  Maybe we just need to get out more?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66037,"nextTopicId":66088}}
