So, I guess I always  <br/>\njust imagined that we create some sort of fancy diploma on the  <br/>\ncomputer and print it out, maybe frame it in a big heavy oak frame  <br/>\nand declare our kids &quot;graduated&quot;.  Why wouldn&#39;t that be as valid as a  <br/>\npublic high school diploma?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that you were afraid that at 30 he would have the same  <br/>\njob options that he had at 18 and no GED.  Well, you have to take  <br/>\ninto account the 12 years of job experience that he would have then.   <br/>\nI agree the interview skills and then job performance go way farther  <br/>\nin job growth than a piece of paper.  I think that many entry level  <br/>\njobs weed out the non-GEDs because if one drops out of school, that  <br/>\nmay point to the fact that one isn&#39;t very reliable or dependable.   <br/>\nBut not often the case with homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither my husband of myself ever graduated from college.

I dropped out  <br/>\nof college in NC at 19 and moved to Miami on a whim and within a  <br/>\ncouple of weeks managed to land a job in sales (totally because of my  <br/>\nawesome interview &lt;g&gt;) and then managed to make 2-3 times what those  <br/>\nentry level job types could make.  My husband is a serial  <br/>\nentrepreneur and has moved from company to company and owed company  <br/>\nafter company.  Now companies pay him a stupid amount of money to  <br/>\ntell them how to better run their companies.  No one has ever asked  <br/>\neither of us about a diploma.  Not even on that job in Miami at 19.   <br/>\nWe often joke that if one of the ventures he always seems to be on  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work out, he could always get a job as a bagger at a grocery  <br/>\nstore and within 6 months likely be running the place.  :D  Have you  <br/>\nreally looked at any of the job options out there lately?

Just like  <br/>\nwe can&#39;t compare our kids to schooled kids along the way, we can&#39;t  <br/>\nstart comparing at the end with a piece of paper.  From what I have  <br/>\nread, homeschooling is growing by 15-20% a year.
