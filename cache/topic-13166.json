Like dishes, picking up clothes,<br/>\n&gt; picking up toys, general helping.  My kids basically refuse!

It was after<br/>\nI read stuff here and at unschooling-dotcom that I realized I wasn&#39;t really<br/>\ndoing much for him.  I mean, I was doing meals and minimal housework,<br/>\ndriving him places, etc., but I wasn&#39;t just doing something for him &quot;just<br/>\nbecause&quot;.  When I started doing that, I started noticing a difference.  But<br/>\nhe definitely wants to pick his own way of helping.  For instance, he<br/>\nrecently took over caring for our houseplants.  He was a bit disgusted with<br/>\nthe way I manage to just barely keep them alive, no more.  He likes to<br/>\njokingly put me down about things, and this was no exception.  But he also<br/>\njust took the job over.  He likes doing yard work way more than housework<br/>\nand is more likely to say yes to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t put up with snotty or rude (unless it&#39;s really a joke like mine<br/>\nlikes to do) and I wouldn&#39;t put up with hitting, etc.  But I wouldn&#39;t pull a<br/>\nheavy about it.  I would say that I don&#39;t do that to him, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nappreciate him doing it to me.  Maybe he could tell me in words what&#39;s<br/>\nbothering him.  Something like that.  If he still didn&#39;t stop, I&#39;d give<br/>\n*myself* a time out.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t know me and have no way of knowing what our household is like,<br/>\n&gt; so....
