It&#39;s an agreement *if* the kids feel they can renegotiate if it&#39;s not working for them. If they can&#39;t change it, then it&#39;s a rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing is that kids aren&#39;t the same as parents. Nor should they be. Kids are dependent on us. They trust that what we will keep them safe as they explore what interests them. So when a parent says (essentially), &quot;I want you to agree to try just one bite of whatever I think you&#39;ll like,&quot; the child will feel the pressure of the parent&#39;s greater power and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are highly sensitive to taste, texture, sight, smell. Asking such a child to agree to one bite is like your wife asking you to try just one bite when the world of food has turned into liver, beets, overcooked spinach (or whatever you find repulsive.) My daughter had a broad range of food she enjoyed. Until it started narrowing at 4. Until puberty approached, about 11ish, there were few foods that appealed to her. Then suddenly things tasted good again and she&#39;d try just about anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra let her kids know if they didn&#39;t like it that they could spit it into her hand. (Which is a nice touch since you don&#39;t want them spitting it onto the table at Grandma&#39;s! ;-))<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can give kids information that&#39;s useful *to them*. You can let them know it&#39;s similar to something you know they like. But then let it go. Don&#39;t become emotionally invested in your child&#39;s choices. If you want to invest your emotions, invest them in creating an atmosphere where kids feel supported in trying what appeals to them AND turning down what doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond thing is, do you have such an agreement with your friends? With your own parents? Wouldn&#39;t that seem awkward and weird and controlling?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile that&#39;s *one* test it isn&#39;t meant to be a final judgement of whether something is relationship building with kids. It is often, though, a good wake up call that an idea that sounds great in theory will feel very differently to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I like to thing of them as principles now<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A principle is an idea that applies to many situations, not one specific one. Kindness. Trustworthiness. Learning. Exploration. Support.<br/>\n<br/>\nA collection of principles that work together to achieve some ideal is a philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I probably wouldn&#39;t make trying a rule today, I would just talk about the principle <br/>\n&gt; of trying new things and only rejecting them if they don&#39;t work for you. I would <br/>\n&gt; set the example by trying things myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even better: move talk down on your priority list. Instead, create an atmosphere that supports exploration. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s better to be kind, to help your kids meet their needs in ways that are kind to others, to help them do things that are kind than to talk about the principle of kindness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":546509970,"authorName":"","from":"skyjeep@...","profile":"richardhowes10","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Too much yes and tandem nursing (was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Relati","postDate":"1402993502","msgId":74419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxub3UwdStyZ3FlOW9AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4NkVEMTBGLTk3M0YtNDc4Ri1BNDRFLUEyM0JBNTk3MTU3REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUzOUYxRjZDLjkwNTA4MDVAd2ViLmRlPgk8OTg2RUQxMEYtOTczRi00NzhGLUE0NEUtQTIzQkE1OTcxNTdEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74417,"nextInTopic":74420,"prevInTime":74418,"nextInTime":74420,"topicId":74416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- If you feel like listing foods, and it s helping you, that s fine.

He refuses <br/>\neverything we offer or he agrees first but does not drink/eat it later. <br/>\nThen he cries for my milk and I feel bad.<br/>\nI think he is not ready yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== It&#39;s not my happiest memory, but nursing him while I was nursing <br/>\nMarty was VERY hard for me, physically and emotionally. It wasn&#39;t good <br/>\nfor Marty, either, who was six months old. ===<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully relate to that. I tried hard to be able to nurse my son at all <br/>\nafter he came home from the hospital. We had a great time but I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave it in me to continue (I pushed my limit for half a year now and <br/>\nstill try to). This is hard. I feel like I need to make a stand against <br/>\nmy son - this makes me unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t eat much either and when he does it&#39;s usually sweets and <br/>\nsugary food. I read somewhere on your page that somebody made a list of <br/>\nwhat her child actually ate for two days. I&#39;m doing the same now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far for today he had:<br/>\n1 pancake with sugar & chocolate<br/>\n1 Banana-Yoghurt Icecone (lots of sugar in it)<br/>\npart of a bread roll (white bread)<br/>\nhalf of a cookie<br/>\n1 hot milk with some chocolate<br/>\nand some sugar cubes, sweets and a sucker (small)<br/>\n(and some of my milk)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis tells me.. he really likes sweet food. I know he likes fish and <br/>\npotatoes, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=== ARE you saying yes to everything he wants? WHY?<br/>\nAvoiding arbitrary and reactionary &quot;no&quot; is good.<br/>\nSaying yes more than no is good.<br/>\nDo you believe somehow that someone has required you to &quot;say yes to <br/>\neverything he wants&quot;?<br/>\nDo you think it&#39;s &quot;the rule&quot; for unschoolers? ===<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a rule at all.
