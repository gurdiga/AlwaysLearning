Berry Brazelton has a good book called &quot;The Irreducible Needs of <br/>\nChildren&quot;.  In it he writes that parents need to enable children to <br/>\npursue meaningful inner-directed goals.  They need to feel a sense of <br/>\npleasure in mastery in the areas of life that are important or will <br/>\nbe important to them.  He goes on to say this sense of mastery does <br/>\nnot wait until a person is a professional athlete or a Nobel Prize-<br/>\nwinning scientist; it starts with the small steps involved in the <br/>\nlearning process itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are naturally gifted at something, starting at a higher <br/>\nlevel will often feel natural, satisfying, and rewarding.  When you <br/>\nare not gifted at something, when you start something new, you have <br/>\nto start out with very small steps or else there will be frustration. <br/>\nIf parents respect the needs of children to develop skills in their <br/>\nown way, at their own pace, they build a sense of mastery and <br/>\npleasure rather than of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly, your daughter expects to be as good at crafts as she is at <br/>\nher performing.

She does not have to participate. I decided to listen. Sometimes <br/>\nshe will tell me she doesn&#39;t feel like listening to this tape. Maybe she is <br/>\nreading or we are doing something that would be interrupted by music. She is <br/>\npracticing a ton and I never tell her, go practice your songs, we pay good <br/>\nmoney for your class and you need to learn these things. Her practice comes <br/>\nnaturally. I encourage it by putting the tape on. I like when learning can <br/>\nflow so easily and enjoyably.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question for the week: How do you encourage kids to try until they <br/>\nsucceed when they become easily frustrated. My 7 and 5 year old sometimes <br/>\ndig their heels in and wail I can&#39;t do it? Sometimes it is as simple as <br/>\ngetting their own plate from the cupboard, or putting on pj&#39;s, other times <br/>\nit is a real new challenge. They scream and often will not try again for a <br/>\nwhile. I often set up a craft or start a craft then it ends in one or the <br/>\nother having a sobbing tantrum and wrecked spirits. Not a fun interaction. I <br/>\nwant a more positive outcome when the I can&#39;tisms start up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5053,"nextTopicId":4957}}
