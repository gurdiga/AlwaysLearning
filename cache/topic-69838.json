My son (who is 14) told me a few days ago that he was a &#39;bronie&#39; and that he was strong and comfortable enough with who he is that it didn&#39;t matter that his friends knew it. I knew he had been watching some &#39;My Little Pony&#39; lately on Netflix but I also know he likes a very wide range of video genres, from Scooby-doo to Resident Evil, old Abbot & Costello to the latest Transformers, you hopefully get the picture he really likes movies and movie history as well as a lot of video game history as well. I also know that he is friends with the younger sister of one of his close friends who is age 10 and loves My Little Pony and they do cross-overs so that everyone can play together. So I didn&#39;t think that much more about it until I read your comment and watched this video on you tube: <br/>\nAre Bronies Changing the Definition of Masculinity? | Idea Channel | PBS <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk&feature=share&list=LLlLaeEN3Nr85idW09vHaJzA\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk&feature=share&list=LLlLaeEN3Nr85idW09vHaJzA</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow I guess to some guys this is a bigger deal than I thought and I wanted to share what I found with other parents who think it&#39;s weird for their older kids to like the show.
