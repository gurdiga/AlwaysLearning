It may not feel like a barrier to the  <br/>\nparents. They can *say* &quot;If the kids want it, we&#39;ll discuss it,&quot; or  <br/>\neven &quot;If the kids want it, we&#39;ll get them one,&quot; but it isn&#39;t the same  <br/>\nsituation as a family just not having broadcast TV because of  <br/>\nlocation or finances or truly mutual choice. They may outwardly look  <br/>\nthe same, but inwardly the children don&#39;t have the same freedom of  <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast month we were a non-car magazines owning family but when my  <br/>\ndaughter saw an exotic car magazine at the grocery store we bought  <br/>\nit.

If I were such a parent I might project  <br/>\nopenness by *saying* she could have any magazine she wants, but my  <br/>\nbeliefs would be a barrier between her and things that went against  <br/>\nmy beliefs. She would know wanting a magazine full of flashy cars  <br/>\nfelt somehow wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TV discussions aren&#39;t about whether or not TV is necessary in  <br/>\norder to unschool.

We had<br/>\nJapanese television mostly in Japanese, but with the occasional<br/>\nprogram in de Englishu.  The fact that he didn&#39;t understand what was<br/>\nbeing said didn&#39;t keep Simon from enjoying television.  He loved Am<br/>\nPan Man a cartoon show with a hero who had a cookie for a head.  In<br/>\nevery episode the bad guy would somehow destroy his head and Am Pan<br/>\nMan&#39;s baker father would have to bake him a replacement head.  There<br/>\nwere really interesting other characters like the toothpaste man and<br/>\nthe guy with a rice bowl for a head, the bad guys ate all the rice and<br/>\nleft him sitting with stars rolling around his head in the classic<br/>\ndazed look. Late at night they ran Mr. Bean which I would tape so that<br/>\nSimon could watch them the next day.  And they had Pokemon.  Pokemon<br/>\nhas been one of Simon&#39;s favorite shows ever since.  They would run the<br/>\nnew episodes at like 7 in the evening in English with Misty giving an<br/>\nEnglish phrase lesson at the end of the show, playing the dialogue in<br/>\nJapanese and then again in English.  He never chose at 3 to watch<br/>\nanything disturbing when he was 3.  And he still never chooses to<br/>\nwatch anything that disturbs him.  We saw Harry Potter and the<br/>\nPrisoner of Azkaban at the cinema and the scene where Lupin becomes a<br/>\nwerewolf haunted him for a time.  When we were at a friend&#39;s house<br/>\nthis summer and they all wanted to watch the movie Simon walked out of<br/>\nthe room when the werewolf scene came up again. I called him back when<br/>\nit was over.  Last night David (dh) and Simon wanted to watch The<br/>\nMeaning of Life before bed, but Linnaea hadn&#39;t liked it all that much,<br/>\ninstead she chose to go upstairs and cuddle with me while watching Tom<br/>\nand Jerry in the Magic Ring.  There isn&#39;t passivity in how they watch.<br/>\n If something disturbs me I walk out of the room, if something<br/>\ndisturbs them they walk out of the room or speak up or turn off the<br/>\ntelevision.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; feel that I&#39;m doing them any disservice by not providing a tv, when<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a whole world available for learning and enjoying. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t access the whole world. I can&#39;t offer my children insights<br/>\ninto rural China.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought of The Grim World of Billy<br/>\nand Mandy, nor would I have thought to offer it to them without<br/>\nCartoon Network. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have<br/>\n&gt; what we have. My family didn&#39;t have computers or game machines when I<br/>\n&gt; was a child.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds too much like &quot;what was good enough for me is good enough<br/>\nfor my children,&quot; which so often, in my experience, prefaces some sort<br/>\nof unpleasant life experience like boarding school or living in a<br/>\ncouncil estate in the UK.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  &gt; If I had a tv, I wouldn&#39;t feel right about setting limits.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Likewise,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  if there&#39;s sugar in &gt;the house, the kids get to eat it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Why would you need to set limits?  Why is the presence of a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>television<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  something that would cause you to set limits?  And what is it about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  sugar that produces the same response in you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t feel that I was meeting my responsibility to protect my<br/>\n&gt; children (at their current ages of 3 and 7 mos) if I provided them<br/>\n&gt; with porn including the softcore content on tv or the gruesome<br/>\n&gt; violence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is the pornography that you believe your children will seek out<br/>\nif you get a television?  In the UK, late at night, on Channel 4 in<br/>\nparticular, there is soft-core porn.  Real Life in a Brothel or some<br/>\nsuch, but neither Simon nor Linnaea have ever wanted to watch such a<br/>\nthing.  I am sure the day will come when they will both be fascinated<br/>\nwith such programs but at 5 and 8 they just aren&#39;t curious about those<br/>\nkinds of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think not having a tv is a limiting action any more than not<br/>\n&gt; having a computer when I was a child was a limiting action by my<br/>\n&gt; mother. We simply didn&#39;t have one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is a limitation. By not having a television you are choosing to<br/>\nlimit your children&#39;s access to certain media.  I don&#39;t know when you<br/>\nwere a child; I don&#39;t know what the economics of your childhood were,<br/>\nbut, your mother&#39;s choice not to have a computer was a limitation as<br/>\nwell.  David and my choice not to have a satellite dish put on our<br/>\nchimney likewise is a limitation.  We are limiting the options of our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives by deciding that the structural damage that might<br/>\nensue is something we don&#39;t want to risk.  Knowing that it is a<br/>\nchoice, and knowing why we&#39;ve chosen to limit the number of channels<br/>\nwe receive makes it an informed limitation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sugar is a drug. It is an unnatural non-food.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sugar is in bread, in fruit, in sugar cane, in vegetables.  It is<br/>\nnatural.  But being natural doesn&#39;t make something good.  Smallpox is<br/>\nnatural.  E-coli is natural.  Heck, drugs are natural: beer,<br/>\nmarijuana, Psilocybe mushrooms, yakowana tree bark (which the Yanamamo<br/>\nIndians use), to name a few. I wouldn&#39;t base your avoidance on natural<br/>\nvs. unnatural things.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes, my children eat<br/>\n&gt; sugar (although I feel guilty about providing it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guilt is an awful thing to offer with food.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since about two-yrs-old my first<br/>\n&gt; daughter has not resisted when I tell her that something is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;tummy-sick.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does that mean?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes in the evening Linnaea will ask to have a glass of<br/>\ncaffeinated soda.  I will mention to her that sometimes caffeine makes<br/>\nit hard for her to get to sleep which she has found frustrating in the<br/>\npast.  If she still chooses to have the soda I won&#39;t stop her.  Is<br/>\nthat what you mean by telling her that something is &quot;tummy-sick&quot;?  Are<br/>\nyou giving her information so that she can make an informed choice? <br/>\nThe words &quot;not resisted&quot; makes it sound like if you say something is<br/>\n&quot;tummy-sick&quot; and she says she still wants it you won&#39;t let her choose<br/>\nto have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a page on food limits: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/food\">http://sandradodd.com/food</a>  and on<br/>\ntelevision <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> that you might get more from. <br/>\nJoyce has a page as well:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/influencing%20kid%20behavior/food/food.html\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/influencing%20kid%20behavior/food/food.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce also has a few pages on television, one of which seemed to<br/>\naddress at least some of what you&#39;ve said:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/influencing%20kid%20behavior/tv%20and%20video%20games/myvalues.html\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/influencing%20kid%20behavior/tv%20and%20video%20games/myvalues.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] question about TV and limits","postDate":"1128734917","msgId":23136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDA4MDEyODM3LjI0NjQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjg3MDM4ODMuNzkzLjQ2NC5tMThAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23135,"nextInTopic":23137,"prevInTime":23135,"nextInTime":23137,"topicId":23030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I did send a long post on this topic some time ago.

I<br/>\nthought it was worth spending the time to write it and<br/>\nthat it presented an alternate view on the tv &quot;issue.&quot;<br/>\n I was wondering if it didn&#39;t go through or what,<br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t get a single comment on it.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nexpect everyone to gather round and make me the center<br/>\nof attention or anything, but it feels kind of like<br/>\nbeing at a party and offering your thoughts or<br/>\nfeelings in a conversation and having no one look at<br/>\nyou or listen to you and act like you are not there<br/>\nand they don&#39;t hear you.  I really was interested in<br/>\nhearing what others had to say about what I offered on<br/>\nthe topic.  Normally I don&#39;t say anything about this<br/>\n&quot;posting into the ether&quot; pehonmenon, but this has<br/>\nhappened to me a lot over the years and I just thought<br/>\nI would mention it just this once and see if anyone<br/>\ndid see my message.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, so anyway, I did have an additional comment to add<br/>\non this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have broadcast tv, no cable, no rabbit ears. <br/>\nWe have dvds and tapes galore and all enjoy watching<br/>\nmovies and shows that way, usually together, on our<br/>\none tv.  Partly we don&#39;t have it because we don&#39;t want<br/>\nit.  We decided not to have it years ago when we still<br/>\nlived in town and had digital cable at that time<br/>\nbefore we stopped.   However for the last 4 years<br/>\nwe&#39;ve lived in a place where we can&#39;t get tv, there&#39;s<br/>\nno regular reception and no possibility of cable. <br/>\nWell ok, we could if we paid for a sattelite dish and<br/>\nthe large monthly service fee for that, but we cannot<br/>\nafford that and even if we could squeeze it into the<br/>\nbudget at some point in the future, we&#39;ve all<br/>\ndiscussed it and choose to do other things with our<br/>\nmoney.  Maybe that will change at some time, who<br/>\nknows.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids are 7, almost 9 and 19.  They don&#39;t complain<br/>\nabout not having tv, wish for it, or feel like they<br/>\nare missing anything.  They don&#39;t feel lost in<br/>\nconversation with their friends due to lack of<br/>\nbraodcast tv, and neither do we.  We don&#39;t have a<br/>\nwhole lot of opportunities to see it other places, but<br/>\nwe do on occassion and we often don&#39;t like it. <br/>\nCommercials in particular usually all of us can&#39;t<br/>\nstand, although a few are clever and less annoying. <br/>\nOur teen lived with a boyfriend and his daughter for a<br/>\nwhile and hated how the tv affected their lifestyle<br/>\nand the tv programming in general that she saw there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not condemming tv.  We have one, we think there<br/>\nare lots of great shows and information available on<br/>\nit.  It&#39;s a tool, like any other, no more evil or<br/>\nharmful than how it&#39;s used.

I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember any television that was particularly meaningful to me as a<br/>\nchild, but there were a few movies like The Last Unicorn and Harold<br/>\nand Maude that stuck with me.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hurried off last night and didn&#39;t reply to your whole post.

Now kids have Animal Planet and<br/>\nNational Geographic channel and don&#39;t have to wait all week to see wild<br/>\nanimals in their natural habitat.  (Among other things)  You can watch<br/>\npeople and animals give birth.  You can watch this new show we discovered on<br/>\nThe Science Channel on how things are made, where they tour different<br/>\nfactories,  you can bond over old re-runs of your favorite shows when you<br/>\nwere a kid.

It&#39;s not a true fact and it certainly doesn&#39;t affect me like a drug. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I grew up eating whatever, whenever (no restrictions) not recognizing<br/>\nthat some foods made me sick, comfort eating, becoming overweight, and<br/>\nnearly dying from anaphylactic reactions several times.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand how you could not recognize that something made you sick.<br/>\nDid you just not make the connection?  If my child ate a lot of something<br/>\nand then felt sick, I might mention that it might be from eating too much.<br/>\nI&#39;d give them information but in the end, I&#39;d let them make their own<br/>\ndecision.  That is how they will learn self control.  My kids have no need<br/>\nfor comfort eating because they are truly joyful and they aren&#39;t escaping<br/>\nanything.  Were you?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There is a<br/>\nspectrum between arbitrary control and protecting/helping when it<br/>\ncomes to being responsible in meeting our children&#39;s needs.

(paraphrasing)<br/>\nSweets eaten in joy are much better for the body and soul then fruits and<br/>\nveggies eaten under duress or with guilt.  I&#39;d take the cotton candy in<br/>\npeace and without judgment any day over something healthy eaten with someone<br/>\nwatching me to see if I was eating healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &lt;&lt;Why did you watch that television?

TVs are everywhere: malls, restaurants,<br/>\nwaiting rooms, etc. We own many, many videos including tv serieses<br/>\nthat we watch on our computer. The computer and Internet have proven<br/>\nto be a valuable resource for information and entertainment. It&#39;s true<br/>\nthat I and my husband don&#39;t desire, and so choose not to own a tv, but<br/>\nif the kids purchase one or ask for one of their own someday, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t necessarily be opposed. I feel strongly about protecting<br/>\ntheir freedom to make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re 3 years and 7 mos old at this time. One could argue that the<br/>\nInternet is no different for the variety of content, but at the girls&#39;<br/>\nyoung ages, the tv poses more of a threat of disturbing content since<br/>\nthey don&#39;t necessarily interact with it to view that content. I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel that I&#39;m doing them any disservice by not providing a tv, when<br/>\nthere&#39;s a whole world available for learning and enjoying. We have<br/>\nwhat we have.

It is an unnatural non-food. I don&#39;t expect this to<br/>\nbe a popular standpoint, but it&#39;s what I think. Food is a whole<br/>\n&#39;nother issue that I have strong feelings about. Yes, my children eat<br/>\nsugar (although I feel guilty about providing it.) But, I don&#39;t fill<br/>\nthe house with it, and I hope that by providing healthy foods and the<br/>\nknowledge of healthy eating and the way our bodies feel will help my<br/>\ngirls to respect their bodies and recognize the drug affect of simple<br/>\nsugars and grain carbohydrates. They&#39;re both gluten-intolerant with<br/>\ndairy, corn, and nut allergies, by the way, so food is something I<br/>\nhelp them make choices about.

It made<br/>\n&gt;  Linnaea uncomfortable so we skipped past it.  They didn&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt;  watch it.  They were very capable of knowing what their limits were in<br/>\n&gt;  that moment.  And what they took away from the movie was the guy<br/>\n&gt;  blowing up from his wafer thin mint and the Every Sperm is Sacred<br/>\n&gt;  song.  Not the scenes they had me skip past.  And when David came home<br/>\n&gt;  from work they rushed the door to tell him about how the third world<br/>\n&gt;  is North Yorkshire (just a smidge south of us and an incredibly apt<br/>\n&gt;  take on the world of County Durham) and about how Brave Sir Robin from<br/>\n&gt;  The Holy Grail is in The Meaning of Life and nothing about how almost<br/>\n&gt;  seeing a scene that made them uncomfortable scarred them for life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While our family watched these horror movies, my little brothers held<br/>\npillows on their laps to cover their faces with as needed. I never<br/>\nchose to do that though. I toughed it out. To this day, one of my<br/>\nbrothers gets visibly sick when he tries to watch a horror movie. I<br/>\nchoose not to watch them, but I have a visceral reaction to fear and<br/>\nadrenaline without concrete basis.

I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember any television that was particularly meaningful to me as a<br/>\nchild, but there were a few movies like The Last Unicorn and Harold<br/>\nand Maude that stuck with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that the tv debate is not one that will be won on either side,<br/>\nand I have no intention of trying.

So, would you keep your children from talking to strangers<br/>\nbecause once someone said something inappropriate to them?  Or would<br/>\nyou not let them eat cookie dough because there is some small risk<br/>\nthat they could get e-coli from the raw eggs?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book comparison gets used because so many people see a<br/>\ntelevision/book dichotomy with television being the bad and books<br/>\nbeing the good approach to story telling.  But of course before<br/>\ntelevision there would have been many other story telling venues:<br/>\ntheatre, public lectures, Punch and Judy shows at the local fete to<br/>\nname a few.  Television has subsumed much of these visual mediums with<br/>\ndocumentaries that are so much more informative than a slide show<br/>\npresentation of My Trip to the Himalayas given at the local Women&#39;s<br/>\nInstitute or with a full out modernized production of Romeo and Juliet<br/>\nwith guns and fast cars and helicopter chase scenes to underscore the<br/>\ntensions of the Capulet and Montague family squabble.  Not to say that<br/>\nyou shouldn&#39;t go to the local lectures or the amazing stage<br/>\nproductions on offer. But my two, Simon (8) and Linnaea (5), didn&#39;t do<br/>\nwell sitting for an hour long talk by Adam Hart Davis (a UK<br/>\nsemi-celebrity who presents Open University science programs for BBC<br/>\nor Channel 4 or some such) on science but they (Simon particularly)<br/>\nlove watching his programs on What the Romans Did for Us, and What the<br/>\nVictorians Did for Us, and all the iterations in between even though<br/>\nhe can&#39;t ask questions, even though it isn&#39;t personal, because on<br/>\ntelevision he can use a range of tools to demonstrate what he is<br/>\ntalking about, but in the lecture hall at the Life Science Centre in<br/>\nNewcastle he had his power point slide presentation and his personal<br/>\ncharisma and that was it.  And without peanut gallery prices, we can&#39;t<br/>\nafford to see that much theatre.  I love stage productions, but it<br/>\ncosts about 40 quid for a family of 4 to go to see the low end version<br/>\nof Oliver, which I just can&#39;t justify that often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to reiterate, the statement wasn&#39;t you should let your children<br/>\nhave porn because you let them read books; it was will you deny them<br/>\naccess to books because they might read pornographic material.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I choose not to offer television by not having one, but I don&#39;t stop<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my children from &gt; watching tv at other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you often go to other places to give them the opportunity of<br/>\nwatching television?

We got the UK equivalent of Netflix for a<br/>\nwhile but decided that both Simon and Linnaea enjoyed owning the DVDs<br/>\nas much as watching them and that there was a certain desire to get<br/>\nthe most for our money by getting, watching, returning as quickly as<br/>\npossible by David and myself that wasn&#39;t matched by Linnaea and Simon.<br/>\n So, when we left for the U.S. this summer we cancelled our<br/>\nsubscription.  While in the U.S. we stayed at many homes that had<br/>\ncable.  Simon was held rapt by Toonami, by Nickelodeon, by Jetflix, by<br/>\nBoomerang, by Cartoon Network.  He lounged in front of the television<br/>\nfor hours at my mom&#39;s house.  At my dad&#39;s vacation condo on the North<br/>\nShore, in between swimming at the falls, and skipping rocks on Lake<br/>\nSuperior, he would watch Teen Titans and Kim Possible and That&#39;s So<br/>\nRaven and all the rest on their satellite television in the bedroom. <br/>\nIt made me realize that David and my economic choice was unfair to<br/>\nSimon and to Linnaea.  So, when we got back we ordered Sky satellite,<br/>\nonly to discover that the way our house is we can only have the dish<br/>\non our chimney which is dodgy at best and with worries of the chimney<br/>\nfalling on the neighbors house it wasn&#39;t a route we took.  There isn&#39;t<br/>\ncable in our deprived area, so not an option.  In the end, after much<br/>\nadjustment of the antennae, we&#39;ve now got a television set box for<br/>\nsomething called Freeview with what is called a Top Up TV card that<br/>\ngives us Boomerang from 5am until noon and Cartoon Network from 6am<br/>\nuntil 6am.  It isn&#39;t quite satisfactory, but it is the best we can do<br/>\nin this house at this time.  And while Animaniacs can make everything<br/>\nstop, particularly for me, the presence of some of the channels Simon<br/>\nwanted have allowed him to satisfy his desire and given him the<br/>\nability to choose to watch or not watch with less desperation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I had a tv, I wouldn&#39;t feel right about setting limits. Likewise,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>if there&#39;s sugar in &gt;the house, the kids get to eat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would you need to set limits?  Why is the presence of a television<br/>\nsomething that would cause you to set limits?  And what is it about<br/>\nsugar that produces the same response in you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I watched television that disturbed me, frightened me, left me feeling<br/>\n&gt; yucky, etc, from as young as I can remember. Some of that imagery<br/>\n&gt;  remains vivid in my memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why did you watch that television?  Why didn&#39;t you walk away?  I just<br/>\ngot Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life last week.  There is a scene<br/>\nwith John Cleese playing a school teacher demonstrating sex with his<br/>\ngood lady wife in the classroom.  It was a scene that made Simon very<br/>\nuncomfortable (and one that I warned him about moments before it came<br/>\nup), so we skipped past it.  There is a scene where Terry Gilliam is<br/>\nplaying a man who filled in an organ donors card and has a couple of<br/>\ndonor harvesters come to his door to collect his liver.  It made<br/>\nLinnaea uncomfortable so we skipped past it.  They didn&#39;t need to<br/>\nwatch it.  They were very capable of knowing what their limits were in<br/>\nthat moment.  And what they took away from the movie was the guy<br/>\nblowing up from his wafer thin mint and the Every Sperm is Sacred<br/>\nsong.  Not the scenes they had me skip past.  And when David came home<br/>\nfrom work they rushed the door to tell him about how the third world<br/>\nis North Yorkshire (just a smidge south of us and an incredibly apt<br/>\ntake on the world of County Durham) and about how Brave Sir Robin from<br/>\nThe Holy Grail is in The Meaning of Life and nothing about how almost<br/>\nseeing a scene that made them uncomfortable scarred them for life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now they are talking about sperm whales and how when two males<br/>\nare attempting to have sex with a ready female they will bash each<br/>\nother about with their penises.  It was something we saw on a David<br/>\nAttenborough program that stuck with them.  I didn&#39;t know that and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it was known before there were television cameras to know<br/>\nit with.  Without the market of selling images to television there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t enough money to support enough people in attempting to find out<br/>\nmore about sperm whales.  The conversation got to sperm whales because<br/>\nwhile they&#39;ve been watching HiHi Puffy Ami Yumi Show they&#39;ve been<br/>\nmaking whales with Hama beads that you put on plastic trays and then<br/>\niron together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, are you limiting your children&#39;s exposure to new things based<br/>\non your negative experiences with them?  Was every moment of<br/>\ntelevision watching a miserable one for you?  Did you never walk away<br/>\nfrom some show feeling better or having a greater grasp on something<br/>\nin your own life than you had before you came to sit down and watch?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215098640,"authorName":"Sara McGrath","from":"Sara McGrath &lt;msaraann@...&gt;","profile":"saraamcgrath","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about TV and limits","postDate":"1128586589","msgId":23126,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwZTVjYmU4MDUxMDA2MDExNm00YmI4NzU5OXM4MmI3YWZjZGM0NTU4OTBiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1Yi41YTNiNDRiMi4zMDZiZGVjZkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1Yi41YTNiNDRiMi4zMDZiZGVjZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23051,"nextInTopic":23127,"prevInTime":23125,"nextInTime":23127,"topicId":23030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If he&#39;s been told it&#39;s too scary, too adult, or <br/>\nforbidden, his natural curiosity might cause him to want to learn WHY.   My<br/>\nkids, with the freedom to turn things on or off, turned LOTS of things off,<br/>\nor colored or did Lego or played with dolls or action figures during &quot;the<br/>\nboring parts&quot; (often happening to be the adult parts--what did they care?)<br/>\nand only looked back up with happy music or light or dogs or kids got their<br/>\nattention again. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this post went everywhere but here - it may be what you were<br/>\nthinking of just before, Sandra. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Was synchronicity on three lists - now four!*<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have yet<br/>\nnoticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost the<br/>\nexact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists, specifically expressing<br/>\nthe same concerns about &quot;limiting to appropriate content&quot; with children of<br/>\nvarying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>\nof television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>\ndepiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>\nfind writing such an essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>\nX&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>\n&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>\nprinciples behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>\nmovies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>\nobjectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>\nor too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>\nthat Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>\nimages, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>\nown specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>\nforwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>\ngradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>\nmusic or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>\nlikely to be scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>\nthey will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>\nhave reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>\nromantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>\nsomething comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>\nother room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>\nexpression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>\n&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>\nwould just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>\nsexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>\ndrama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>\nIt is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>\nclarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>\nbumps into at times on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>\nattracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>\ndevelopmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>\nput it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>\nto receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>\nthat I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>\nseeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>\ncommunication between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>\nand relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>\ncharacters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>\nthat are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>\nparenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>\nconflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>\nadopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>\nthe experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>\nsometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>\ncalling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>\nhave Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>\nover in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>\nnegative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>\nonto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>\nthese detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>\nmost significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>\nportrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>\ntheir friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>\ntime is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>\nsome really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>\nstuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>\nwho likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>\nschool a necessary evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>\nwhat we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>\nas they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>\nconcomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>\npeer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>\ndisconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>\nboth incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>\ninfantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>\nor parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>\n:P~~). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>\nrecognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>\nseparation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>\nclass of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>\npossible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>\nreal children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>\n&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>\nprice to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>\npeople make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>\nthrough the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>\npunishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>\ncharacters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>\nastonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>\ncuriosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>\nvery &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>\ndiscovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>\nRaven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>\nregular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>\nrecord the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>\nfeatured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>\nnot include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>\n&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>\nviewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>\nlimit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>\nhad lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>\nalong the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>\nmoments.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>\nauthentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>\nvalues influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>\nregardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>\nin their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>\nthat will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>\nthey may try on.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
