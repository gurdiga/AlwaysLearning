So, many times, he&#39;s able to negotiate himself into playing much longer and my 4 year old is left still waiting.

I am concerned that my 4 year old is being manipulated.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThen let the four year old play as long as he wants to.  He&#39;s not going to play that long.  He has a shorter attention span.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in no case should the one who&#39;s waiting be right there, doing nothing but waiting and bugging the other player.  Get them off doing something else, being happy elsewhere instead of waiting right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I see with measured turns is that the quality of game play is compromised.  If someone sees the clock and that&#39;s when they have to stop, they won&#39;t play as thoughtfully.  They&#39;re less likely to look around at the art or appreciate the music.  If they&#39;re starting to read, they&#39;re less likely to take a moment to look at the text and see if they can tell what it says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits of game play will not come to full fruition if kids&#39; time is measured that way and they&#39;re not learning to share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they only have an hour, they will take ALL of that hour, just as kids whose TV time is limited will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt they can play as long as they want to, they might play for five or ten minutes and be done.  I&#39;ve seen it in Holly, I saw it for half an hour in Marty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Kirby wanted it more.  He was older and it was his game system and he could play better. And so in exchange for me keeping the other kids away while Kirby was playing as long as he wanted to, he let them play as long as they wanted to, which was never as long as he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an attempt to &quot;be fair,&quot; parents can be very UNfair.  Children don&#39;t all need the same things for the same amount of time.  Measuring with rulers and timers and charts is often shortchanging one child or another.  What they could use more than that is the opportunity to decide when they&#39;re finished for their own reasons.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/economics\">http://sandradodd.com/t/economics</a> applies to time on computers, too.

That seems to keep down on instances of an older child taking advantage and continuing to play for longer than nec. to get to the next good stopping point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the Wii was a gift to ME from my husband, so when my oldest gets frustrated about one of the younger kids wanting to play a game that is &quot;his&quot; -- given as a gift by an aunt or something -- I remind him that I&#39;m sharing my Wii with the family and that he knows if one of his games gets scratched or something that I will figure out a way to replace it. That is usually enough for him to relax about sharing. He has invested a LOT of money in Skylanders, though, and I fully support him in not having to share that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI gave him a DSLite (purchased used off another homeschooler for $25) for his birthday last year, and I never once asked him to share it with his siblings. But when he got an iPad from his grandparents and lost interest, I negotiated a buy-back (he charged me $12) so that it could become the &quot;Family&quot; DS and I bought a bunch of games for the girls so that there was another option for them if they were in the mood to play games but another kid was already on the Wii or computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetween the Wii, Computer, DS, and the apps on my phone (for any of the kids) or the iPad (for my son-only since it is his), there is usually enough electronic choices to keep the kids entertained while they wait their turn if they are not interested in reading with me, drawing, cooking, etc. while they wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe the games that belong to your son, is there any way to negotiate a deal, like we did with the DS, so they become family games and not his sole property? I&#39;m a big believer in not forcing sharing. But maybe if they aren&#39;t one-player games, progress-saving games, etc., he&#39;d like to sell them to you so he could go buy something else? This works well with my son, but it definitely wouldn&#39;t work with all kids (my nephew for example really likes to &quot;collect&quot; his DS games and prefers to display the ones he&#39;s completed rather than sell/trade them back to the store or to a friend).<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in NJ<br/>\nwith Joseph, 9; Hannah, 6; and Miriam 4<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here are some collected ideas on sharing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sharing\">http://sandradodd.com/sharing</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From that link:  &quot;Occasionally the first person wouldn&#39;t be finished in an hour and they&#39;d negotiate to stay on...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My issue with this in our family is that my 8 year old is much better at negotiating than my 4 year old.

We went to Goodwill a couple times and he picked out a couple plates, cups, etc. that were for his restaurant. As he grew a little older (closer to your older son&#39;s age), he expanded on the imaginary play to be more of the real-deal -- he made his own menus, he could make some of the things off the menu (cheese + crackers, for example), he typed up newsletters for his restaurant, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was very into Pokemon and we spent lots of time every day playing with Pokemon action figures. We&#39;d use some of his building toys to make castles and towers and so forth for the Pokemon, or we&#39;d have Pokemon battles (like on the tv show & games). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn nice weather days, we&#39;d load up a bunch of his action figures, hot wheels & bigger cars/dumptrucks/vehicles, and other toys and take them into the backyard and play with them out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did indoor forts often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was 5 before he discovered video games, but even when he did, he still enjoyed doing the above things . . . he still enjoyed having me spend lots of time doing imaginary play with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways you can make life fun for him, so that video gaming isn&#39;t the only exciting thing to do at home.

They are 8 and 4. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old doesn&#39;t want his little brother to play his video games. My 4 year old wants to play only his big brother&#39;s games. My 4 year old has some of his own games but he doesn&#39;t like to play them and is not willing to give up the fight to play his brother&#39;s games. My 8 year old will eventually let his little brother play but it&#39;s usually because he gets worn down by his younger brother rather than him really wanting to share. Are there ways to let the older one have some games all his own and have the younger one get to play some of the games without me setting the limits?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 8 year old almost always goes first and plays longer, for obvious reasons. I don&#39;t keep a running ticker of who played what first last time or how many turns each one got. I talk to my 8 year old about how it would be nice, since he&#39;s older and bigger and all of that, to let his little brother go first sometimes, which he does but not very often. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also talked to them about different ways that they can figure out when to switch turns, like finishing a mission or level or after so many times of dying in the game. That works somewhat but the 4 year old invariably has longer wait times to play and shorter times of playing. Sometimes they agree to play for a certain amount of time but that doesn&#39;t work with every game depending on the purpose. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hear from them many times a day, &quot;It&#39;s not fair!&quot; I have no clue how to make it fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have some two player games so they can play at the same time but one of the controllers doesn&#39;t always work.
