So we are very <br/>\nselective in what we do because not being able to do it together is not <br/>\nwhat we want.  So i met a mom recently who told me they did let her <br/>\nattend with her child in a Bronx Zoo program (known as strictly kids <br/>\nonly no parents allowed) because she told the staff child had learning <br/>\ndisability or some such special need and needed her in attendance - if <br/>\nthey required proof she&#39;d be happy to get a note from her pediatrician.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, when my dd&#39;s ballet teacher came to me to talk about the <br/>\n*problem* with dd leaving class frequently, i told teacher dd (then 8yo)<br/>\nhad a small bladder and that was why she would frequently leave the <br/>\nclass.   That was an acceptable answer.  The truth was she sometimes <br/>\njust wanted to come and give me a hug (i was always sitting on the <br/>\nother side of the big glass window during her class).  I thought it was <br/>\nwonderful that she wanted to just come and give me hug but that answer <br/>\nwas not what the teacher was looking for - she was expecting me to cut <br/>\noff my dd&#39;s freedom to come and go in the room.  The other truth was <br/>\nthat if she did need to go to the bathroom she still wanted me with <br/>\nher - but of course that explanation would never have been acceptable <br/>\nfor an 8yo &lt;lol&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other day, this years ballet teacher came to me to talk to me <br/>\nabout my dd&#39;s &quot;chatter.&quot;  She explained that when a question was asked <br/>\nand the kids raised their hand to answer and that dd did that part just <br/>\nfine (guess what folks - somewhere along the line she learned to raise <br/>\nher hand and not just call out an answer in a teacher/class <br/>\nsituation).  The problem dance teacher wanted to discuss was that dd <br/>\ndidn&#39;t answer the question but responded with something that in <br/>\nteachers mind was unrelated to the question, i responded by saying with <br/>\na joyful (and proud) smile, &quot;yes she&#39;s always thinking several steps <br/>\nahead.&quot;  Teacher did not expect this answer. So she turned to dd and <br/>\nsaid directly to her, &quot;when i ask a question i need you to answer what <br/>\ni ask.  If you have a story to share save it for the end of class.  I <br/>\nwill leave time for sharing at the end of class.&quot;  Dd kind of shrugged <br/>\nand then when teacher left looked at me with a baffled expression not <br/>\nquite understanding what the teacher was referring to. My response, &quot;i <br/>\nlove the way your mind works and all the connections you make.&quot;  She <br/>\nswelled up with pride and we both left the studio feeling really <br/>\nwonderful about who we both are in the world!!!

DD really <br/>\nenjoys the class.  The teacher, who is also a friend, is a volunteer, <br/>\na school-at-home homeschooler.  I told my friend when the class <br/>\nstarted that DD is not yet reading or writing.  She said that was <br/>\nfine.  (I should have specified here--no worksheets, no reading out <br/>\nloud.) The class has been without a textbook and my friend has been <br/>\ncoming up with very creative and fun lessons which DD enjoys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday they got the textbook and my friend made up a worksheet about <br/>\nit--sort of a scavenger hunt through the book.  After class my DD was <br/>\nin tears about not being able to do the worksheet.  I talked to my <br/>\nfriend later and mentioned again that DD is not yet reading or <br/>\nwriting.  This is what my friend replied:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And how are you intervening with that?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;I&#39;m not, I trust that she will read when she is ready and in <br/>\nher own time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFriend: (Quoting statistics and research on brain <br/>\ndevelopment) &quot;dendrite connections peak at age 8 and if the child is <br/>\nnot reading by then the dendrites in the literacy area of the brain <br/>\njust start being sheared off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;What about children who read later, say age 10 or beyond?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFriend: &quot;I&#39;m sure there are isolated cases of that happening but it <br/>\nbecomes much harder.  You really should have her tested to see what <br/>\nthe problem is.  It could be dyslexia, dysgraphia, sensory <br/>\nintegration disorder, letter tracking (?) . . .the wait and see what <br/>\nhappens approach is wasting precious time in which she could be <br/>\nhelped.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  (I am reeling in shock from her confrontation and feeling quite <br/>\ndefensive and just wanting to get away from her!) &quot;That is <br/>\ninteresting but could you just not ask her to do worksheets in class?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFriend:  &quot;Well, I have to teach at a 3rd grade level and use the <br/>\nbook.&quot; (This tells me that she is not willing to accommodate a not-<br/>\nyet-reader.  Maybe she doesn&#39;t even know how!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;Do you think I should withdraw her from the class?&quot;  (Until now <br/>\nDD has loved the class and really enjoys the service projects--last <br/>\nweek they made blankets for the children in the homeless shelter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFriend: (Who I am not so sure is really a friend!) &quot;No, no!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left it at that.  This is the first and only time my DD has ever <br/>\nbeen made to feel bad about not reading.  I feel terrible about it.  <br/>\nI thought my friend was capable of dealing with this but she is <br/>\nunwilling to help my child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis same friend has had her child extensively tested for Sensory <br/>\nIntegration Disorder, learning disorders, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt defensive as it seemed to me she demanded of me to know what I <br/>\nwas doing to help my child read.  I wanted to ask her if she has read <br/>\nany books by Frank Smith, especially &quot;Reading Without Nonsense.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am asking for advice.  I am feeling unsure of myself.  This <br/>\nsame DD is highly intelligent, curious about everything, is currently <br/>\nin to Archie comics, Nancy Drew graphic novels, computer games, <br/>\ngymnatics and sewing by hand.  Together we are reading our way <br/>\nthrough several Judy Blume books, we joined a nature class in which <br/>\nwe are learning about trees at a local park, and we are making <br/>\nHalloween costumes.  I also have a math course which she picks up <br/>\nfrom time to time (it has a DVD).  DD will watch the DVD and work her <br/>\nway through a portion of the book.  This same friend might be <br/>\nhorrified to know the math course is kindergarten level and DD&#39;s goal <br/>\nis to learn to skip count and then to tell time--in that order. <br/>\n<br/>\nDD also understands concepts quite well and frequently wants to <br/>\ndiscuss why the price of gas is higher at this one station we pass.  <br/>\n(She knows because I comment on it.)  She is very interested in the <br/>\neconomics of supply and demand and frequently brings it up.  My <br/>\nhusband told me tonight he was trying to explain capitalism to her <br/>\nthis evening when they passed the station again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend might also be horrified to know that my DD spent most of <br/>\nlast year drawing books of stories.  She would draw them and bring <br/>\nthem to me to add the words.  I would write while she dictated.
