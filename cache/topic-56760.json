She wasn&#39;t an example of anything being suppressed.  She spent nearly 10 minutes bashing the system she gamed and from the looks of it, everyone sat there and smiled politely.  She credited her &quot;new&quot; perspective on a teacher.  Then she finished by talking about how to make the system better.  If anything I thought it showed how kids can turn out just fine in public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, it also illustrated how a person feels when they realize they&#39;ve wasted so many years of his/her life in a broken system.  I suspect the message was probably lost on pretty much everyone there.  <br/>\n~Michelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;tinap&quot; &lt;luvvs2learn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; This is an amazing speech!
