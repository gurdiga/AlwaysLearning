Is this true, and how do I do that? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to talk a bit about strewing, and getting the world outside the home into it. &quot;Constantly throwing out new ideas&quot; sounds a very active thing. A lot of bringing the world into the home is more responsive. For example, you don&#39;t need to think &quot;OMG, countries, they don&#39;t know about different countries, where do I start? I&#39;d better show them a map of India, and &quot;. Rather, when your child is looking through a beloved picture book of animals you can say things like &quot;Yes, it&#39;s a lovely tiger.&quot; And then, depending on the engagement of the child, you talk about where they live wild, where (and why) they live in captivity, what they eat, how they live, how big they are, that they purr like Kitty, that they&#39;re endangered (and why, and what people are doing about it) etc etc etc. It might spin off into maps, youtube clips etc. Not all at once as this is not a unit study in tigers but a conversation lasting only as long as the child is interested (and that may be not at all). My point is that the big wide world is brought alive in every conversation with your child, in every pursuit of interest by your child. And they retain information they find interesting in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two sons aged 6 and 9. At first I understood strewing to be buying new and different things like games or books and leaving them where the child could see them and pick them up if interested (this *is* strewing but only part of it). I used to think strewing didn&#39;t work with my 9 yr old because whatever I left lying around for him to discover was just pushed aside to create space for whatever he was doing. So I stopped strewing in that kind of way and started to look at his interests and think of things either directly to do with them or very similar eg he loves lego, so I&#39;ve bought large plywood pieces for lego layouts, introduced lego computer games, Minecraft,  The Brick Show (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brickshow.com/)\">http://www.brickshow.com/)</a>, youtube lego animations, other construction type kits (eg meccano) etc etc. Some stick, some don&#39;t. Some lead further eg watching The Brick Show led to him making his own lego kit review videos. My second son is much more likely to pick up random things lying around, and want to play with, read or watch whatever it is.  So for him my earlier view of strewing is appropriate and so as well as expanding his current interests I consciously strew a wider variety of things for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nBringing the world into the home is not only about the children&#39;s interests but the adults. DH and I have become more curious and expanded our own interests and we too are living a richer life through unschooling. Our children are aware of many of those things too, even if it doesn&#39;t seem so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the world comes into the home in unexpected ways. For example, our children had been given a book called something like &quot;25 great paintings every kid should know&quot; which was lying around gathering dust. One day we were all together. The boys were playing lego on the floor and I picked up the book and asked DH if he wanted to see how many of these great paintings he knew.

I was in the classroom with him and he was looking like he needed some help, so I asked him if he did.  He said he would like some help and managed two more sentences in the 20 mins of break (I was fine with that, not sure if the teacher was).  He chatted while we &quot;worked&quot; and he said, &quot;You know Miss, my family have a problem with writing, we just can&#39;t seem to do it.....&quot;.  He was 7!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a young man of 7 who was playing with the eraser in the middle of the table while listening to the teacher&#39;s explanantion of what they were going to do in the session.  He then began flopping about a bit and laying his head on his arms.  The teacher moved him from the table to the carpet (which to me gave him the space and freedom he was craving and so perhaps was not a great idea on the part of the teacher.  And did not achieve what she wanted, him to sit still). He got more and more restless.  He was then punished by being kept in 5 mins at lunchtime. <br/>\n <br/>\nI could give you many more examples,  I know even on a what I perceive as a &quot;bad and unproductive&quot; day in my house it never gets as bad as this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps.

My sons got to watch our toilet be replaced.  It kept getting plugged because roots were clogging the pipes.  That was fun for a while.  Later that evening a neighbor came to rewire our garage.  My oldest son saudered something for him and they had some questions for him about what they already new about electricity and what he was doing.  This same neighbor gave my son a small dirt bike that he spent the one evening putting together. He told my son he has a weed eater motor he can help him put in it. They came to dig up the street for a leaky pipe.  Middle son watched for a long time. Boys go to work with their dad when its possible.  My oldest son went up to a neighbors and when I drove by he was raking their leaves, alone?  Thought that was funny.  All the other kids were, who knows where.  An other time they painted their new bunkbeds with them. <br/>\nUtube has inspire lots of activities, cake decorating, building things with connects, miming, all sorts of science related fun experiments.

He spent some time sneaking peaks at the painters working on our walls downstairs. He was too shy to go close, but was really interested in what they were doing. Audrey (2) got up next and I got them both dressed. James (6) sleeps late because he is on my (night owl) schedule and is a night owl himself. He wakes naturally 95% of the time, but today I woke him up to make lunch and a playdate with another unschooler and her son (Hi Marin!). We got in the car and met Marin for lunch. Afterwards, we went to a park to play on the playgrounds. It was sunny and very warm here and the kids were content for hours. James is typically introverted and has never been in any forced child-corralling situation, so I pay close attention at how he interacts with other kids and I was pleased that he was comfortable and happy to play. I wasn&#39;t &quot;looking for learning&quot; at the playground, but upon reflection now in writing,this, its clear that a lot was going on: Social dynamics, cooperation, compromise and problem solving,  experiments in physics galore on equipment, tests of personal strength, toughness, and bravery, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we left, the kids were wiped out and hungry and grumpy by time we get home. I made them something to eat when we got back - different things for each kid based on what they asked for. Dad came home and sat down and watched &quot;Up&quot; with them, a movie they have watched 5-6 times in the last week. They love for me to narrate the montage of the old man&#39;s life at the beginning since it has no dialogue at that point. After a little playing, food was needed again, so we got,them some more food. After that, everyone got baths and played happily. After the bath, they all wanted their hair dried (a new thing, just this week) and teeth were brushed and I put Audrey to bed. Tyler played with Dad and then they went to bed. I cleaned up downstairs and James was on the iPad. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I returned upstairs, I tried tomget on Minecraft to check it out from James because it&#39;s been mentioned here a lot lately and Marin said her son is enjoying it. The page wouldn&#39;t load for some reason, so we downloaded the free Minecraft app onto our iPads and explored how it works, a bit. We discovered,we can play in the same world over wifi. Now, James is watching YouTube videos about Minecraft and I am writing this. Next, I&#39;ll read chapter 7 of the fifth Harry Potter book to him and we&#39;ll turn out the lights. At that point, he&#39;ll ask me everything he&#39;s currently wondering about and we&#39;ll talk, sometimes for 5 minutes, sometimes almost an hour. If we really get going and curious despite the lateness, I&#39;ll turn on the iPad and start looking stuff up. In the last few months, that has included Jupiter, frog dissection (there&#39;s an app for that, seriously), various geographical curiosities (e.g., I went to Phoenix on a rare business,trip and she wanted to know where that was, and about Korea because I spent the trip,with Koreans). iPad resources to satiate curiosities in the middle of the night in the last month have included use of the Internet and Wikipedia, a free NASA app, frog dissection, google earth, a dictionary app, a free science 360 app and you&#39;ve to watch some Vi Hart videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, a pretty rich and varied life for a 6 year old I think. I think sometimes how that, if he was in school, there&#39;d be no late night talks and middle of the night questioning and looking stuff up. And if I was tempted to teach him &quot;lessons&quot; and make his connections for him, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d so readily ask the questions and be so excited when he makes connections on his own. In a teaching environment, he&#39;d be too busy being &quot;taught&quot; to read, doing math drills, and homework to even have the brain space to wonder about much else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a great quote the other day that will stick with me forever. I think it was on one of the unschooling Facebook pages, but maybe not.

My son<br/>\nloved to play certain video games and we would sit together and play these<br/>\ngames.  Sometimes our whole family would spend time surfing the web,<br/>\nlooking for the answer to whatever questions one of us had come up with.<br/>\nThere really are no stupid questions and now with the internet, you can<br/>\nlook for the answer to any question any time of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know it&#39;s my own fears and baggage keeping me from trusing the<br/>\n&gt; natural learning process.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my opinion, the hardest part of unschooling is learning to trust the<br/>\nprocess, yourself, your children.  Also, you must learn to respect your<br/>\nchildren and value them and their desires.  So, if your child wants to<br/>\nlearn all about trains, or mold, or mustard, or whatever, if you really<br/>\nrespect her, you support her desires to learn that particular thing and you<br/>\ndon&#39;t try to impose what you want her to learn or think that she should<br/>\nlearn.  Childhood isn&#39;t a race.  Just as your children learned how to walk<br/>\nand talk and eat and a host of other things, they will learn all of the<br/>\nother stuff that they need to learn to be happy, healthy human beings, in<br/>\ntheir own time.  No one can force a person to learn anything.  You really<br/>\ncan only provide incentives for them to behave in a certain way and that<br/>\nwon&#39;t necessarily work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no doubts about the ability of older children, say 10 and<br/>\n&gt; older, to discover their world and their interests without constant adult<br/>\n&gt; interventions, but I get confused/uncomfortable when it comes to the 5-9<br/>\n&gt; age group.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember the first time that my son realized that he had a foot.  He was<br/>\nprobably somewhere around 6 weeks.  He had been 5 weeks early and low birth<br/>\nweight, so he was finally getting up to the size of an average newborn.  I<br/>\nwas changing him and had to apply some ointment and powder; well, this made<br/>\nthe whole ordeal too slow and he fussed a bit.  To express his feelings on<br/>\nthe matter, he kicked his feet up in the air.  Well, then he noticed his<br/>\nown feet.  He proceeded to grab one of his feet and pull on it and looked<br/>\nat it and moved it a bit.  He then tried to get it in his mouth and<br/>\nmissed!! He then noticed that he had two of these nifty things and tried<br/>\nbasically the same things with the second foot.  I was fascinated to watch<br/>\nall of this.  Here this tiny baby that had had a pretty rough start was<br/>\nabsolutely enthralled with his own two feet!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is natural curiosity and  exploration at a very early age.  Children<br/>\nare naturally inquisitive.  As a matter of fact, parents spend a lot of<br/>\ntime protecting and (unfortunately) thwarting a child&#39;s natural desire to<br/>\nexplore.  Every time a child tries to get into the cabinet full of<br/>\nbreakable glass wear or knives or household poisons, they are being<br/>\nnaturally inquisitive.  Of course, any reasonable parent prevents a child<br/>\nfrom harming themselves, but when a child discovers pens or crayons and<br/>\nwants to draw and proceeds to explore how they work on the wall, how a<br/>\nparent handles the conflicting needs of the child to explore and the adult<br/>\nto have crayon free walls will indicate their parenting philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an early unschooler, I grabbed the big roll of paper and taped it on the<br/>\nwall and let my daughter rip.  I spent time watching her draw and drawing<br/>\nwith her.  Now, on reflection, I might have asked her to only draw in a<br/>\nspecific place and painted it with really scrubbable paint.

It is up to you to model active learning as a way of<br/>\nlife.  Perhaps you mean you are &#39;strewing&#39;, meaning you place things around<br/>\nto give your children the opportunity to pick up on that thing.  I am sure<br/>\nthat there is something in Sandra&#39;s vast library, but I am horrible at<br/>\nfinding such things.  (Little help)<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a park and look at trees and see if you can figure out what kind of<br/>\ntrees they are, even without their leaves. Go to the library and let<br/>\neveryone check out any book that they want.  Help them look up books on the<br/>\nelectronic catalog, if you don&#39;t know how to do this, ask the librarian to<br/>\nshow all of you how to use the library.  Read those books to your children,<br/>\neven if they aren&#39;t &#39;educational&#39; or even if they aren&#39;t kids&#39; books.  My<br/>\ndaughter loved art and biology and so we spent a lot of time looking at<br/>\nscience texts and reading parts of those books.  These were high school and<br/>\ncollege books, but she checked them out.... My son loved chemistry and the<br/>\nperiodic table.  We spent many hours reading the book of the elements....<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any local groups that you can join in on field trips?  I am lucky<br/>\nto have a very unschool friendly group that arranges a bunch of field trips<br/>\nfor great discounts to lots of fun stuff.

It may be that the trouble is you&#39;re looking for learning to look like projects and activities, field trips and explanations, rather than kids living their lives. Those things - the projects and trips and whatnot - are a part of living life, but often those are just the highlights. Most learning looks like kids doing perfectly ordinary things in familiar places. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than thinking about typical days, it might help you to think about learning itself - what it is and how it happens naturally.
