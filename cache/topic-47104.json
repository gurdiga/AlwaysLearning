I have been thinking a lot about cooking lately actually how it makes some mothers and fathers feel tied down. I love food and like cooking if I enjoy it & if my children enjoy it, but something felt wrong about cooking, when I did some self examination I realized that I intuitively felt that raw foods was more natural for me. I am nowhere near going all raw and I don&#39;t think anyone has to go extreme in any direction, but the ability to follow your intuition, with food or habits, I think is important. If you don&#39;t like to cook you may enjoy raw foods. It involves planning ahead a couple of days in advance, or if you don&#39;t like planning you can just get some legumes and nuts and start them soaking and sprouting. Spouts usually take a couple of days, nuts and other things take a day or 2 to soak, there are appliances involved a lot, but do not be discouraged, anyone, any where can sprout & you can often find a food processor or blender on freecycle or craigslist. I make a smoothie for my children in the morning (really easy & fast) with some protein powder & spirillina (spiralina is a great way to spike your children&#39;s food if they don&#39;t feel like eating vegetables).<br/>\n smoothie takes me 5 minutes.<br/>\nIf you have some things soaked or sprouted preparation is usually 5-10 minutes and the instructions are as complicated as &quot;mix all ingredients & serve&quot; or &quot;put all ingredient in the food processor & serve&quot;. I have eaten food that feels so much more nourishing and alive and spent so little time cooking since getting in the habit of making more raw foods. <br/>\nHere is a really simple great book if you interested:<br/>\n&quot;Living in the raw, recipes for a healthy lifestyle&quot;<br/>\n by Rose Lee Calabro<br/>\nHere&#39;s one on the philosophies and wisdom behind raw foods if your interested: <br/>\n&quot;The Sunfood Diet Success system&quot; by David Wolf<br/>\nWhen I have a feeling I usually try and learn what it is leading me to and trust in my own wisdom and the wisdom of my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease email me if you want to talk more about this~<br/>\nMany Blessings~<br/>\n~Angie, Cedar & Rowan Moss</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47040,"nextTopicId":46955}}
