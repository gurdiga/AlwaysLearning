He travels and we go with him.<br/>\nWithout a bedtime, they get to spend time with their dad, more than the 2<br/>\nhours many fathers get. Obviously because of this choice, we don&#39;t try to<br/>\ncram dinner and homework into those few hours. And whoever said jobs are a<br/>\ncertain time are living in a different mindset, husband earned his PhD and<br/>\nnever did the 9-5, he has a very hard time with that and he was schooled.<br/>\n(funny you mentioned oobleck, we played with that last night!)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Nov 17, 2012 at 11:16 AM, Trista Teeter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tristaleann@...\">tristaleann@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; == People kept saying if we didn&#39;t have scheduled bedtimes our kids<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to hold jobs. :-) ==<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, I too was very grateful for the lifestyle and ideas we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; adopted in regards to sleeping schedules...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A year or so ago our Friday evening would have consisted of ordering a<br/>\n&gt; pizza, hiding it from our kids so we could enjoy it ourselves, trying<br/>\n&gt; desperately to get them in bed before 8pm so we could have our Adult Time,<br/>\n&gt; but struggling with everything from them eating dinner quickly enough to<br/>\n&gt; brushing their teeth to staying in bed.  Then my 4 year old would have been<br/>\n&gt; out of his bed at least once at night, begging to come sleep with us and I<br/>\n&gt; would have had to choose his comfort of sleeping with us or my husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; comfort of having enough space to comfortably sleep.  My 6 year old would<br/>\n&gt; want her light on and door open because she&#39;s scared when her brother is<br/>\n&gt; not in there, and the light would have kept me awake.

My husband said he would like a pizza for<br/>\n&gt; dinner.  I preferred Pita Pit.  The kids (4 and 6) passed on pizza in favor<br/>\n&gt; of Subway.  I ran around and picked everyone&#39;s goodies up and brought them<br/>\n&gt; back to my very thankful family.  My son had been waiting all day to play<br/>\n&gt; Minecraft with his dad, so I joined in watching them for a bit.  Come 8pm<br/>\n&gt; there was no bedtime, there was wrestling and playing with oobleck.  Then<br/>\n&gt; we hunkered down to introduce the kids to Star Wars.  Around 10pm my 4 year<br/>\n&gt; old asked me to help him brush his teeth and go to bed with him (we&#39;ve now<br/>\n&gt; combined our beds to make one giant bed).  Around 1:30am my 6 year old came<br/>\n&gt; in and whispered to me if I was awake.  And she told me very excitedly,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Daddy and I snuggled on the couch and watched Star Wars and Mythbusters<br/>\n&gt; and ate some chocolate chips.&quot; and gave a huge contented sigh.  I heard her<br/>\n&gt; dad come back in, walk over to her and say, &quot;I forgot to give you<br/>\n&gt; a kiss goodnight.&quot;  He walked back out and she asked me if jellyfish have<br/>\n&gt; eyeballs.  We both fell asleep shortly after discussing the anatomy of<br/>\n&gt; jellyfish and I was woken up by my 4 year old wrapping his arms around me<br/>\n&gt; and snuggling into my side and the biggest smile plastered on his face.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A year ago I would have seen no other way--we were doing bedtime just like<br/>\n&gt; everyone else, which had to make it right.

And I&#39;m amused that, having given up on sleeping at 3:15 a.m., I came upstairs to clean the kitchen so Marty could eat breakfast more easily, then Holly came home at 3:30, and then Marty got up at 3:45.   Quite the busy half hour! :-)      <br/>\n<br/>\n Marty works at 4:30 some mornings. Holly&#39;s working at 12:30, and has plenty of time to sleep before then.   People kept saying if we didn&#39;t have scheduled bedtimes our kids wouldn&#39;t be able to hold jobs. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is working at Target (for foreigners, a big department store), unloading the once-a-morning truck and stocking shelves (some of truck unloading and some shelf-stocking, different days).  Because they&#39;ve rearranged the store for Christmas, and because there is this increasingly pernicious &quot;black Friday&quot; thing in the U.S., of stores having competing sales on the day after Thanksgiving, when many people are off work for that four-day weekend...  there is a LOT of work in the store these days.  Some days he only works three or four hours.  Sometimes they would love for him to stay for eight, but he&#39;s taking classes four days a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!!! And four days a week reminds me...<br/>\nHolly told the story of a family she knows (kid in school, seven) whose grandfather is pressuring the parents.  They&#39;re done what he sees as a bad thing, Holly says.  The boy (who is seven; that seems important to Holly) goes to a charter school with a four-day week.   The grandfather says the boy is going to grow up thinking the world is that way, with three-day weekends.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy is seven.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Kirby works four overnight shifts of ten hours, and has a three-day weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; friend Brett Henry (who was unschooled) is a fireman who works 48 hours all in one lump, with a four-day weekend, and the schedule rolling backwards, so the 48 hours (7:00 a.m. to another 7:00 a.m.) aren&#39;t on the same days every week, and everyone there has Saturday/Sunday off, as the rotation goes through the weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty&#39;s girlfriend Ashlee is working for an ambulance company as an EMT and driver.  She works three twelve- to thirteen-hour shifts, and has a four-day weekend.  Ashlee went to regular school.  She was a cheerleader.  She wasn&#39;t prepared for these odd hours.  Her three shifts have different starting times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLife isn&#39;t the way it was when towns closed down at 5:30, and even in those days many people worked outside those hours (bakeries, restaurants, hotels, security, transportation, farming, lamplighting, medical professionals and such).   <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it&#39;s partly classism (white collar jobs, in the 19th century and early-20th-century sense, as opposed to &quot;laborers&quot; and servant kinds of jobs).  Partly, it&#39;s electric lights and heat (electric or gas) that made a difference, too.  People can still work even when the sun is down. Partly it&#39;s inflexibility and age.  Partly it&#39;s that sort of justification and resentment with which older people think/feel/say &quot;it&#39;s not fair&quot; when younger people get to do things that they didn&#39;t get to do when they were younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for less than an hour, this morning before 4:15, my house had three adults awake and busy, and one adult sleeping. :-)  And because of electrical appliances, dishes are being washed and clothes are being dried, and I get to write to people a long way from me who might read it almost immediately, or when they wake up, or in a month or a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69636,"nextTopicId":69610}}
