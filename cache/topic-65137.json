Of course I know a part of it, the ones I used more probably.  And if I need a result I can&#39;t remember, then I calculate!  I did it so often that I saw patterns in the tables and developped tricks to do it faster.  Anyways maths can&#39;t be about remembering something by hart, it&#39;s about thinking, logic and algorithms.

That turned out to be when he was 15, almost 16, after he chose to start at vocational college and was required to take an assessment test (literacy and numeracy).  Even then, we ended up spending less than a day on the topic because he had already become competent at multiplying two numbers in his head &#39;by osmosis&#39; over the years and only needed to familiarise himself with the table system itself.  He certainly wasn&#39;t asked to recite the times tables (or sing them) at the assessment.  He would have been asked multiplication questions in the test and, if so, would probably have got them right.  He top scored on both the numeracy and literacy tests.

It did not work for me. <br/>\nI have been told basically that is my problem (and it is) but everyone should be able to learn it by rote.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a feeling in my family that &quot;you&#39;ll never be a success&quot; if you do not know your times tables (and other things).<br/>\nI feel that I am a success. Before becoming a mother I was a Landscape Designer and used Math every day all day.<br/>\nI saved money enough to buy my own property (in cash) and build a garage to live in by 26yrs old.<br/>\nI am also terrible at spelling and could not read until 13yrs and have anxiety, stress and depression. I suppose if anything these &#39;set backs&#39; have helped me achieve. I read, read, read and read more...and day by day as I de-school I grow more and more happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my children...I have looked at things like &quot;Multiplication Rock&quot; and other games which involve money or quick counting. (My children are only young yet so there is not too much pressure). Already my DD understands the ideas of the 2x tables through counting truck wheels and stepping stones. So through my observations I feel we are already heading down the track of self learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still do not know all of my times tables but I do understand how they work. I am not saying I wouldn&#39;t like my children to learn their times tables as I do see it as a good skill for games, shopping ..life. But do they have to be fearful parrots?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like ask for some links or more ideas to learn &#39;times tables&#39; as well as some information to be peaceful and share that you do not have to learn them by rote.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of first post.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still in the stages of de-schooling and for me rote learning meant chanting and sitting down and having drills. It meant FEAR! And rote learning does not have to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that de-schooling takes time. I am scared because of my own lacks I will fail my children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that I can share this<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nMegan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65140,"nextTopicId":65205}}
