I am definitely a little muddled and it shows in my writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It was feeling disingenuous to put her off by saying &quot;at Christmas you can get that&quot; which seemed to satisfy when she was littler.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sometimes you have to put people off.  Nobody can get everything right now, not even billionaires.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I meant that it felt disingenuous to repeatedly say over and over, &quot;maybe you can get this for Christmas&quot; knowing full well she would never get all these things. Also I guess for me I feel like it is better not to build up one day or holiday and go really overboard while saying no most of the other time. I would rather be generous as much as possible. I agree that not everyone can have everything they want. I&#39;m trying to figure out what is reasonable. And as someone else has mentioned, the allowance is making it easier for me to set my boundaries and say no when I am not comfortable with things. <br/>\n <br/>\n-=- Do you have a digital camera?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could take pictures of the things she really likes and note where she saw them.  If she wishes a week later she still had it, you can go back.  If not, she has the photos of beautiful things in the world.  Don&#39;t call it &quot;Things X wants,&quot; but &quot;Beautiful things I saw&quot; or something.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this idea. We already have a &quot;wishlist&quot; on Amazon which she LOVES to look at and add things to and it is good for us because there are many things to choose from when we want to get her something! I like the picture idea for when we are out shopping though. I also generally agree that avoiding stores when we don&#39;t feel like we have money to spend is beneficial. I&#39;m liking the idea of being more proactive in helping her find things cheaper too - through craigslist, ebay etc. and thrift stores or yard sales.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- Also we already have many, MANY stuffed animals but I am trying to appreciate that is her love and also that she should spend her money as she c<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But that wasn&#39;t her money.  Three dollars a week doesn&#39;t equal $25 on a whim.  And matching her funds isn&#39;t showing her what $3 will buy, either.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had $13 saved. I&#39;m definitely rethinking the &quot;matching&quot; her savings every time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And stuffed animals should not be &quot;her love,&quot; as in her only love, or the center of her life.  Maybe you and she should do more things with the stuffed animals she has.  Play with them.  Rearrange them.  Find them some accessories around the house, or at thrift stores.  Chairs, or beds, or clothes.   Props.  Jewelry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I guess I&#39;m still unsure where my boundaries are on this issue. When to say no? when to say not today? How to support her and be generous without going overboard? I also know that there are no &quot;right&quot; answers and that we have to work out in our family what is right for us financially etc. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are wrong answers.  There are better-than-worse answers.   Principles. If the principle you&#39;re considering is learning, and you&#39;re not comfortable with what she might be learning, that&#39;s a time to say &quot;not today,&quot; and move slightly to the side, while still being supportive.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, again I agree. That is why I like getting perspectives here. I guess I meant to say that I know no one here can tell me the &quot;right&quot; way for our family.  That is something I&#39;m working on myself - wanting someone to tell me the &quot;right&quot; way. I was so good at school and getting the &quot;right&quot; answers! It&#39;s much harder to think for yourself. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=- I do know that the outlook I am trying to embrace is once again NOT the mainstream and I really value the perspectives I get on this list-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your goal is to be &quot;not the mainstream,&quot; though, those trains depart in too many directions.   You need a new ideal and goal based on principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again I think I wasn&#39;t writing clearly, sorry! It&#39;s not my &quot;goal&quot; to be &quot;not mainstream&quot;. I just meant that once again I find the practices that I believe are best for our family AREN&#39;T the &quot;normal&quot; mainstream way. One thing I like about this list is how those of you experienced unschoolers emphasize that we still live in the REAL world and that unschooling absolutely does NOT make us or our children &quot;exempt&quot; - from the law, from manners, from being decent people etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Your question seems to be couched in all-or-nothing ideas.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/balance-=-\">http://sandradodd.com/balance-=-</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying not to do this but it may be something that I struggle with.

But we could always pay the credit card in full, so it wasn&#39;t until our fixer project went bad and we had to get serious about the budget that we really had any idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dave Ramsey website has free printable budget forms. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/tools/budget-forms/\">http://www.daveramsey.com/tools/budget-forms/</a> We&#39;re slowly working through this, watching what we *really* spend each month, and which annual/semiannual expenses are predictable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve sort of figured out is that each of us has our own allowance for nonessential items for that person alone. I am free to spend part of mine on my daughter or activities, but it&#39;s still a concrete number. It&#39;s good for my relationship because I don&#39;t need to argue with my husband about buying expensive wine or a radio subscription or whatever. He has his allowance and he spends it how he wants. We&#39;re working past the dynamic of, &quot;My wife won&#39;t let me.&quot; And my kid certainly didn&#39;t need to be exposed to us arguing over money on that sort of level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as our child gets older, she&#39;s likely to have more expensive desires and the more organized we are with our finances, the more able we will be to make big dreams come true. It&#39;s scary and mildly inconvenient right now but I am hoping to not pass on my money anxiety. I don&#39;t have math anxiety, but I totally have money anxiety! <br/>\n<br/>\nLost the Christmas all year round quote, but I wanted to say, I would ask if there&#39;s something else he feels like you should be spending that money on. Saving for retirement? Saving for the next car or house or keeping an emergency fund or whatever? Maybe that&#39;s behind this partially. Or is it just an emotional/&quot;spoiling&quot; concern issue?

What does he fear will happen if her life feels like Christmas all year long? Is it a bad thing to experience that kind of happiness other than at Christmas and birthdays?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps he&#39;s worried she will expect to get everything she wants. That is not an uncommon worry for new unschoolers!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, seeing and experiencing for yourself that she will *not* grow up expecting to get everything she wants is one of those unschooling leaps of faith. Those of us with older kids can tell you that&#39;s how it happened with our kids, but until you experience it yourself, it&#39;s a leap of faith until you reach that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the idea of Christmas all year long, we embrace it in our household, not just for our son but also for my husband and myself. But because we do that, Christmas is not the big haul of gifts it was when I was a kid and only received goodies at Christmas and birthdays. My son&#39;s Christmas wish list was quite short last year, and my husband and I each only came up with one idea for our lists. We&#39;re not wealthy; we&#39;re not buying stuff all the time. But we do use our fun money to buy things we want throughout the year, and if that means we have less gifts under the tree at Christmas, we (including our son) are okay at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could you do to help it feel like Christmas all year long for your husband? Not long after last Christmas, I made a lemon pie especially for my husband, a recipe we usually only have at holidays. He was SO thrilled!! In fact, there are several foods that we think of as &quot;holiday foods&quot; that I like to surprise him with randomly throughout the year -- it&#39;s a real treat for him, and quite easy for me to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335633701,"authorName":"DaBreeze21","from":"&quot;DaBreeze21&quot; &lt;susanmay15@...&gt;","profile":"DaBreeze21","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Advice on handling Big Wants in a positive way","postDate":"1303958189","msgId":60857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwYWpyZCtkbGFwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlwOGQxZytlbjdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60840,"nextInTopic":60868,"prevInTime":60856,"nextInTime":60858,"topicId":60823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi again!

If you were 100% in agreement with how you were raised and you weren&#39;t unschooled, would unschooling interest you?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents were generous with gifts on our birthdays and at Christmas, but otherwise we rarely received things. We didn&#39;t go to the mall, my mom didn&#39;t take us to the grocery store with her nor did she bring us treats, we didn&#39;t go to record stores or bookstores or toy stores, we didn&#39;t go putter around Walmart-type stores &quot;just because&quot;. There were people who thought we were spoiled, but it didn&#39;t feel that way to me then and it doesn&#39;t feel that way in hindsight. I definitely feel a sense of &quot;lack&quot; when I think back to my childhood (not just about material things), and it absolutely has impacted my adulthood, and also my parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate some of my parents&#39; parenting choices, very much. And those carry over into my own parenting. But the areas where I felt lack, I&#39;m parenting my son differently in those areas. And it helps me to remember that if I&#39;m feeling negative judgment from one of my parents about how I&#39;m parenting (&quot;spoiling&quot;, &quot;giving in&quot;, etc.). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to think in terms of, &quot;I&#39;m HAPPY to be able to do this for my son!&quot;, whether that be to buy the bazillionth Pokemon / stuffed animal / video game, or to snuggle with him if he&#39;s having a hard time falling asleep, or to help him find game faqs or walk-throughs when he&#39;s stuck, or to make a trip to the library to get a book we couldn&#39;t find at the bookstore, or . . . or . . . or . . ..<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he&#39;s gotten older (he&#39;s 12 now), the need to have &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;more&quot; has decreased substantially. He, my husband, and I all receive a certain amount of &quot;fun money&quot; each month, and my son&#39;s invariably more thoughtful about how he spends his than I am. I tend to spend mine within a couple days, and, even though I&#39;m more thoughtful about purchases than I used to be, I still have buyer&#39;s remorse more than I like. And my son&#39;s had buyer&#39;s remorse at times too, but at age 12 he is miles ahead than where I was well into my adulthood when it comes to money! I do think that has been impacted tremendously by him not growing up with a feeling of lack.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":331885657,"authorName":"Jennifer Schuelein","from":"&quot;Jennifer Schuelein&quot; &lt;fairiedust66@...&gt;","profile":"jenfromtx6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Advice on handling Big Wants in a positive way","postDate":"1303885680","msgId":60832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwOGQxZytlbjdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGluNUQtUDBBakU0NDMyZExvMVBUcnU3VndBTlZBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60831,"nextInTopic":60833,"prevInTime":60831,"nextInTime":60833,"topicId":60823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 11 years old and he also does not ask for many things these days.

He doesn&#39;t ask to eat out of the house, either, unless it&#39;s a special occasion like a birthday. When he was younger I said yes constantly and my budget could afford quite a lot (Hello, Thomas the Train collection plus stuffed animals). I did not implement allowance until Xander was about 7. Until then, he got pretty much all that he wanted. Some people told me that he would turn out spoiled and I got a lot of push back from my ex-husbands family. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, today at 11 years old Xan has told me that the best thing about holidays is the giving part. He donates his gently used items to charity and LOVES to think about others. He also loves to save his allowance and sees it as a goal to be attained (like getting all of the stars in a Mario game level). When he&#39;s saving for something large, I do chip in when I can. Our budget is vastly different now and he is very understanding. He also loves getting deals (I taught him about sales very early on) and he just loves saving money on an item. I really think that saying yes so much has helped Xander become the guy he is today. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gwen Montoya &lt;lifeisjustthis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two things that have really helped my kids:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) not taking them shopping unless I had money to spend.

My daughter is 4 (will be 5 in July) and over the past year her <br/>\ndesire to buy and receive new toys has grown a lot. We first started noticing <br/>\nthis past fall. We&#39;ve always been pretty laid back and generous about getting <br/>\nher things especially when we are &quot;out and about&quot; but she really started <br/>\nactively asking for more toys. It seemed like every commercial she saw on TV she <br/>\nwanted the toy (I know it really wasn&#39;t EVERY toy, it just felt like it).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was feeling disingenuous to put her off by saying &quot;at Christmas you can get <br/>\nthat&quot; which seemed to satisfy when she was littler. So we started an allowance <br/>\naround Thanksgiving time - she is getting $3 a week. We also usually have her <br/>\nsave up for half of something and pay the other half. This seems to be working <br/>\npretty well. I spreads our purchases out, and she is learning a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I/we (my husband and I) are still struggling a little though. I have <br/>\na lot of conflicting thoughts/feelings inside. For instance today we went to the <br/>\nmall and she ended up getting a pair of $5 sunglasses and a stuffed animal <br/>\n(unicorn) for about $20. To do this we had to &quot;use&quot; this coming Friday&#39;s <br/>\nallowance which means we shouldn&#39;t purchase anything for a while now. I was with <br/>\nmy mom and I can tell that she thinks we buy her too much so I&#39;m sure that is <br/>\ninfluencing how I feel (a little guilty, like I &quot;gave in&quot; or am a softy etc.) My <br/>\nmom and I are close and I do value her opinion a lot. Also we already have many, <br/>\nMANY stuffed animals but I am trying to appreciate that is her love and also <br/>\nthat she should spend her money as she chooses.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long and is a bit vague. I guess I&#39;m still unsure where my <br/>\nboundaries are on this issue. When to say no? when to say not today? How to <br/>\nsupport her and be generous without going overboard? I also know that there are <br/>\nno &quot;right&quot; answers and that we have to work out in our family what is right for <br/>\nus financially etc. I do know that the outlook I am trying to embrace is once <br/>\nagain NOT the mainstream and I really value the perspectives I get on this list, <br/>\nso any advice or experience with what has worked with your family would be <br/>\ngreatly appreciated.

Except my daughter is almost 4, and we started right after Christmas. We started with $3 a week, and then a $12 bonus the first weekend of the month so she could buy a bigger thing once a month even if she spent her money each week. This was partially keeping in mind the $16 princess sets she&#39;s collecting. I dropped the bonus because she didn&#39;t quite *get* it, was happy with her small purchases without it, and we have a lot of big expenses coming up. I had been worried about her not being able to save up for something really big, but she&#39;s starting to choose to save, and there hasn&#39;t been anything really big that she desperately wanted but couldn&#39;t manage to save for. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried the matching thing the first few weeks, but I found it a little confusing and strange. The plan was that she&#39;d spend all her money on one toy she chose there in the store, and I&#39;d match it if she needed a little more money, but then that money that she *could* have had wouldn&#39;t roll over. I didn&#39;t want her to not be able to get something she wanted, but I didn&#39;t want her to buy a totally different thing with &quot;my&quot; money either...Too much control, in the guise of helping. I wanted to simplify.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I think it is less stressful to both of us for her to be completely in control of the weekly toy budget, and my deciding whether or not to advance or contribute &quot;my&quot; money makes her purchases subject to mom&#39;s whims again. I don&#39;t do loans, because to me it is confusing and just leads to disappointment when she has no money the next time.I don&#39;t want to be in that position; that&#39;s a big part of why she has the allowance. Of course, if she saw something exceptionally amazing at a garage sale or somewhere we couldn&#39;t go back to, and she had almost enough money, we&#39;d probably talk about what we could skip that week to make up the money and buy it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI *do* buy small gifts mostly in advance of holidays when she isn&#39;t present, out of a gift budget, and buy things like activity kits and puzzles that we can do as a family out of our activity budget. My boundary at the library used book store is that I&#39;ll pay up to 50 cents on a book/CD/DVD, and then if she wants something that costs more, she can pay the rest. She&#39;s happy too. It&#39;s not perfect--I can see the silliness in agreeing to pay for 3 50 cent books but not one $1.50 one-- but it&#39;s a start.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still ironing things out, but I can tell you that searching garage sales on Craigslist for &quot;toys&quot; or &quot;girls&quot; or whatever kind of thing she&#39;s been wanting has helped us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have too much stuff feelings. I feel like picking up the house is taking away from my family time. I have pretty low standards, but past a certain point it snowballs and she doesn&#39;t play with things as much. I&#39;ve been working at sorting things better at night so we can rotate them in and out of storage and better keep them off the floor. It&#39;s helping. My daughter doesn&#39;t mind stuff sorted but it makes her angry to watch me do it. We&#39;ve also started gently coaching her to put things back when she is about to just put them down and walk away. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex N<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;DaBreeze21&quot; &lt;susanmay15@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nSo we started an allowance around Thanksgiving time - she is getting $3 a week.

My daughter is 4 (will be 5 in July) and over the past year her desire to buy and receive new toys has grown a lot. We first started noticing this past fall. We&#39;ve always been pretty laid back and generous about getting her things especially when we are &quot;out and about&quot; but she really started actively asking for more toys. It seemed like every commercial she saw on TV she wanted the toy (I know it really wasn&#39;t EVERY toy, it just felt like it).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was feeling disingenuous to put her off by saying &quot;at Christmas you can get that&quot; which seemed to satisfy when she was littler. So we started an allowance around Thanksgiving time - she is getting $3 a week. We also usually have her save up for half of something and pay the other half. This seems to be working pretty well. I spreads our purchases out, and she is learning a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I/we (my husband and I) are still struggling a little though. I have a lot of conflicting thoughts/feelings inside. For instance today we went to the mall and she ended up getting a pair of $5 sunglasses and a stuffed animal (unicorn) for about $20. To do this we had to &quot;use&quot; this coming Friday&#39;s allowance which means we shouldn&#39;t purchase anything for a while now. I was with my mom and I can tell that she thinks we buy her too much so I&#39;m sure that is influencing how I feel (a little guilty, like I &quot;gave in&quot; or am a softy etc.) My mom and I are close and I do value her opinion a lot. Also we already have many, MANY stuffed animals but I am trying to appreciate that is her love and also that she should spend her money as she chooses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long and is a bit vague. I guess I&#39;m still unsure where my boundaries are on this issue. When to say no? when to say not today? How to support her and be generous without going overboard? I also know that there are no &quot;right&quot; answers and that we have to work out in our family what is right for us financially etc. I do know that the outlook I am trying to embrace is once again NOT the mainstream and I really value the perspectives I get on this list, so any advice or experience with what has worked with your family would be greatly appreciated. I think I&#39;ve read before about people that have kids with &quot;big wants&quot; and how to be positive about it. I don&#39;t see how making her feel bad about it or her feeling like we say no all the time can be good for her or our relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60894,"nextTopicId":60981}}
