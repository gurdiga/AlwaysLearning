My husband happens <br/>\nto be a drug & alcohol abuse counselor, a goal he has worked very hard <br/>\nto achieve and hopes one day to co-own a clinic. He just happened to <br/>\nbe at a conference this last week where Kathleen Crowley was giving a <br/>\nsession about Procovery and selling the book she wrote about it. My <br/>\nhusband perked up when she mentioned Sandra Dodd&#39;s name and he <br/>\ninformed her that we were unschoolers and after talking with Crowley <br/>\nfound out that she is an unschooling mother of 2 grown girls and that <br/>\nshe had used a slightly altered version of Sandra Dodd&#39;s certificate <br/>\nof empowerment in her work, with Sandra&#39;s permission of course. So I <br/>\nthought I would share that and to say a thank you to Sandra for <br/>\nhelping those recovering from addiction as well as all the work you do <br/>\nin spreading the ideas of unschooling.
