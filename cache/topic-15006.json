Kass and Kree recently watched the movie &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; about <br/>\nthe evil tooth fairy who kills anyone who actually looks at her. They have <br/>\nalways loved scary movies. They couldn&#39;t wait to see this one. We watched it at <br/>\nour next door neighbor&#39;s house and when we got home they were petrified. At <br/>\nfirst I thought they were being funny and joking around. They asked if they could <br/>\nsleep in our room, which they do all the time without asking, but I think <br/>\nthey wanted reassurance that daddy was gonna sleep close enough to get anyone who <br/>\nthreatened his babies. Phil, DH, was shocked too. He also thought they were <br/>\npulling our legs. They laid down and went in to this long discussion about not <br/>\nwanting to lose their last tooth. Which happened to be loose in both of their <br/>\nmouths. Phil and I giggled as we settled into bed. Sparky, our dog, sat up <br/>\nquickly, hearing another neighbors Hummer drive up and the girls went balistic. I <br/>\nmean they screamed the kind of scream that makes your blood go cold. Phil <br/>\njumped out of bed and said &quot;What the F**k?&quot; I on the other hand was ROBLMAO. I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Kevin just got home!&quot; So although he hadn&#39;t been scared by the movie, he <br/>\nhad been by the shreek of our daughters screams. When they all realized what I <br/>\nhad said, the girls started to cry and Phil was just a little ticked at his <br/>\nown instincts. All I could do is crack up. In the end, they were all mad at me, <br/>\nso I got up to watch TV in the family room. Still laughing, I grabbed a <br/>\nblanket, and as I headed for the hallway with Sparky in tow, the girls screamed <br/>\nagain!!! &quot;Don&#39;t go out there alone mommy!&quot; I literally fell to the ground dying <br/>\nwith laughter. I am not a scary movie watcher, so the fact that these three <br/>\nscary movie addicts had frightened themselves to such a degree, was just more <br/>\nthan I could take. I came back to bed and took another half an hour to stop <br/>\nlaughing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say they lost that last tooth, but forgot all about the movie <br/>\nwhen the fairy had left them $5.

There are several sites on the internet and some good<br/>\nbooks. One of the most encouraging books I have read is called &#39;Son-rise:<br/>\nthe miracle continues&#39; by Barry Kaufman. It is that story of a family whose<br/>\nson displayed severely autistic behaviour and they developed their own way<br/>\nof working with him against the trends of the day which were and still<br/>\nlargely are based on behaviour modification. Basically they accepted his<br/>\nbehaviour and allowed him to be himself.<br/>\nWe try to do this with our daughter as well as helping her learn to consider<br/>\nthe needs of other family members or folk in general. A balancing act!<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.tonyattwood.com - one of the leading Drs on AS<br/>\nwww.aspennj.org<br/>\nwww.autism.org<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are ones I have found info from.

I&#39;m hoping to get some ideas here to help me out with some <br/>\nissues with Andy, our 7yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been back and forth on the TV issue for most of my Mom years. I <br/>\ntend to want to allow them to watch TV when they want, but with a <br/>\nsecret hope they&#39;ll actually watch much less than they do.  Both Will <br/>\n(now grown) and Andy are HUGE TV watchers, where Dan (only 2) is the <br/>\nonly one who actually turns it off -- ever!<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy has always been a special kid -- he&#39;s larger than life in many <br/>\nways, very energetic, very sweet, with some really weird food issues <br/>\n(tactile defensive stuff, I think) a big imagination, and an <br/>\namazingly obsessive focus and enthusiasm for his interests.  He&#39;s <br/>\nalso always been a worrier, for lack of a better word.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, he&#39;s developed some real anxiety issues -- can&#39;t stand to <br/>\nbe alone in a room, even in daylight; wants someone to walk him even <br/>\nto the bathroom; won&#39;t go to sleep alone (a skill he&#39;d only recently <br/>\nacquired anyway); is calling out several times some nights, with bad <br/>\ndreams; and whining a lot; he desperately wanted me to hold his hand <br/>\nas we walked down the hall to bed tonight (which I did).  Not a sweet <br/>\nhand-holding thing, but out and out frantic anxiety!  Maybe the <br/>\nregression is about his oldest brother leaving home -- but that was 2 <br/>\nmonths ago, and they didn&#39;t even get along all that well anyway <br/>\n(they&#39;re very different types of people) -- I&#39;d think that by now, <br/>\nhe&#39;d have adjusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the last few days, he&#39;s begun telling me he&#39;s afraid of <br/>\ncharacters with names like he hears on Pokemon cartoons. It started <br/>\nme thinking... in the past couple of months, his TV viewing is way up <br/>\n(we lifted all limits in March) and he&#39;s watching a lot of anime <br/>\nstyle cartoons.  I wonder if this could be causing his anxiety? Not <br/>\nso much in a scary character way, but in some kind of input <br/>\nprocessing way?  Given his tactile issues -- not just about food, <br/>\nhe&#39;s also very high-need to be touched/snuggled, has to play with my <br/>\nhair whenever he can, just never seems to get enough physical <br/>\ncontact -- I&#39;ve begun to think he may have some sensory integration <br/>\nissues, and wondered if this could also be responsible for his <br/>\nobsessive tendencies (yes, he&#39;s also more than a little obsessive).  <br/>\nUntil now, we&#39;ve just dismissed his quirks as just &quot;Andy&quot; done our <br/>\nbest to help him work thru his issues and trusted he&#39;d get thru <br/>\nthings just fine.  Now I&#39;m starting to wonder how we can help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that anime, specifically, might be a problem for him?  I <br/>\ntold him tonight that it seems to me that the more TV he watches -- <br/>\nespecially anime -- the more anxious he is overall.  We&#39;ve been <br/>\ntalking about his anxiety/fears in the last week or two, to sort of <br/>\nbrainstorm ideas and solutions to help him.  I suggested he cut back <br/>\nto only a couple hours of TV a day, and against my better judgment <br/>\nagreed to allow two anime shows -- Pokemon & Digimon -- only because <br/>\nhe acted like I&#39;d cut his heart out at the very idea of not allowing <br/>\nanime!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI reminded him that we&#39;ll be leaving for Hawaii soon, where there&#39;s <br/>\nno cable TV and he might not even be able to get Pokemon (grandma & <br/>\ngrandpa have only the Big 3 and PBS, with somewhat spotty reception) <br/>\nso maybe now would be a good time to start cutting back to prepare <br/>\nfor the loss of TV in Hawaii. He countered that it&#39;s more fun in <br/>\nHawaii, it&#39;s no fun here in Albuquerque and that&#39;s why he has to have <br/>\nmore TV!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do for him..... but it breaks my heart to see <br/>\nhim so anxious, not to mention how very tired I am of walking him to <br/>\nthe bathroom and having him shadow me all the time.  Right now, <br/>\nDaniel at 2yo is more comfortable away from me than Andy!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas or help?<br/>\n<br/>\nSyl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15047,"nextTopicId":15109}}
