Maybe a <br/>\nlist of personal attributes would be more helpful.  Something like...<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents tend to have:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.)  A stronge sense of curiousity<br/>\n<br/>\n2.)  A love of life<br/>\n<br/>\n3.)  A love of learning that supercedes their love of order<br/>\n<br/>\n4.)  A high tolerance for noise<br/>\n<br/>\n5.)  Access to lots of children&#39;s books and resources...etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what the &#39;right&#39; answer for leaving the house is.  If we&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to the park, I need to pack diapers, wipes, extra clothes for my <br/>\npotty-training daycare kiddo, sunscreen, sunhat, water, cups, snacks, <br/>\nblanket, toys for the baby...so it takes me quite a while.  Also, whenever we <br/>\nleave the house I wear makeup (3 minutes, tops) and my kids have their long <br/>\nhair brushed and pulled back, and their faces and hands clean.  But at the <br/>\npark I don&#39;t tell my kids what to play or bore them with lectures on botany, <br/>\nso I guess we&#39;re still unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think you have to be contantly on the go in order to unschool, and <br/>\nI think you can unschool and still be clean and neat.  (But nobody would get <br/>\nthat idea from looking at my house.  &lt;g&gt;)  I have a fairly low tolerance for <br/>\nnoise so either I stay away from the area where my kids are being noisy or <br/>\nthey go to another area.  (That&#39;s why God created basements and back yards.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, a few things I would add are <br/>\n<br/>\n6.)  Ability to withstand criticism from friends and relatives.  <br/>\n<br/>\n7.)  Ability to trust children&#39;s innate capacity for natural learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n8.)  A loving, non-adversarial relationship with their children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\nSubj:  Re:pre-test for unschooling<br/>\nDate:  97-05-21 12:44:31 EDT<br/>\nFrom:  SandyZ9072      <br/>\nPosted on:  America Online<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What other kinds of factors should I be considering? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget my personal favorite.

That is, Sandra <br/>\nfrequently describes the way she uses whatever&#39;s on the radio or TV or a <br/>\nbillboard or whatever in talking to her kids, throwing out interesting <br/>\nhistorical tidbits all the time, for example. I&#39;m guessing that Sandra sees <br/>\nand thinks and talks, involving her kids in her own thought processes, <br/>\nwithout conciously trying to. I think that must make it easier to unschool <br/>\nfor her than it is for me, a natural introvert, because my thinking and <br/>\ntalking are all more deliberate. I don&#39;t speak off the top of my head, <br/>\ntypically; I see and think and think some more, and it may not occur to me to <br/>\ntell the kids what I&#39;m seeing and how I&#39;m thinking about it. Doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>\ncan&#39;t unschool (I am!), but it may mean I need to be more deliberate about <br/>\nit.
