I never checked to<br/>\nfind out for sure. I was anticipating that the Department of Schools<br/>\nwould get back to me to ask why I hadn&#39;t returned their forms. They<br/>\ndidn&#39;t. I had no inclination to ask *them* if they wanted the forms<br/>\nreturned because I couldn&#39;t complete them and, in fact, had thrown<br/>\nthem away. As time passed and nothing happened and, metaphorically<br/>\nspeaking, my educational ship sailed off over the horizon to new<br/>\nlands, I ended up in a non-relationship with the Department of<br/>\nSchools. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds very familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was eight, in the old days when there were nominal test  <br/>\nrequirements in New Mexico (three tests, when kids were about 8, 10  <br/>\nand 13, later changed to another arbitrary set of years, later  <br/>\ndropped) I was still in the state homeschooling group, getting their  <br/>\nnewsletters, going to their conferences.  Unschoolers were the bright  <br/>\nend of the room, but not the majority.  They were more competent, but  <br/>\nless driven (and so forth).<br/>\n<br/>\nA test year came, we were all reminded, a place and date were set, I  <br/>\nwent to the meeting before where they explain and coach and we sign  <br/>\nup.  I signed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went home and realized Kirby wasn&#39;t going to have any fun or do  <br/>\nwell, therefore it was going to be a big detriment.  He didn&#39;t read  <br/>\nwell enough to do something like that independently, at eight, and he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like being surrounded by strangers yet (he got to love it  <br/>\nlater, and to read like any rules lawyer that ever played games with  <br/>\n150 page rules books).  So we just ditched.  I drove him sixty miles   <br/>\nnorth  to Santa Fe to have a leisurely stroll and food, so I could  <br/>\nhonestly say &quot;We were out of town.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell him &quot;There was this test, and we&#39;re ditching out.&quot;  We  <br/>\njust had a really nice several hours far from home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a letter saying there was a makeup test and if he missed that  <br/>\none he had to have a very good excuse or else.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that scene in Galaxy Quest with the dramatic count-down on  <br/>\nthe computer?  Very scary.  It gets to 1.  That&#39;s all.  Nothing happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt free and invisible!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I wasn&#39;t very worried is that I worked in the public  <br/>\nschools.  I know what the scores of tests are used for, and we didn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed any of it.  And as little as school counsellors use the scores,  <br/>\nthe MAIN purpose of them is the group averages.  Kirby was going to  <br/>\nbring the average down, and and mostly-conservative curriculum-using  <br/>\ncreationist-teaching leaders of the &quot;everyone has to be tested&quot; were  <br/>\nafter high scores, not lower, and so I didn&#39;t feel we had let the  <br/>\nteam down at all, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that in any school, there are kids who miss the test and then  <br/>\nmiss the make-up date.  Or they move from one school to another and  <br/>\nmiss both.   If the child is a likely candidate for extra funding  <br/>\n(special ed one way or the other), they might administer it  <br/>\nprivately.  But if the kid&#39;s an average kid not worth daily cash,  <br/>\nit&#39;s probably not worth the time and expense of getting it scored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to do the testing was to have a psychologist or a  <br/>\ncertified teacher (lapsed certification was okay with them) proctor/ <br/>\nsign off.  So my sister&#39;s kids took theirs at home, she sent them to  <br/>\nme, and I signed off on it.  I couldn&#39;t have done my own kids&#39;, just  <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s.  I told her I wanted nothing to do with it if she  <br/>\nreally followed the times and the rules.  She didn&#39;t give them  <br/>\nanswers, but she let them quit when they felt done.  So I was fine to  <br/>\nsign it.  She also gave the time-honored advice that if they thought  <br/>\na question was stupid or they were tired of it, just guess or make a  <br/>\npattern on the answer sheet.  The bad thing about the test-at-home  <br/>\noption was that the tests were purchased for $35 apiece from Bob  <br/>\nJones University, an odious institution, and mailed back to them for  <br/>\nscoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end of very long story I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told.  Very long isn&#39;t  <br/>\nunusual.  &quot;Haven&#39;t told&quot; is. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":296692554,"authorName":"j md","from":"j md &lt;lunawillowmoon@...&gt;","profile":"lunawillowmoon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] can anyone answer these questions?","postDate":"1207294643","msgId":34035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczNDcyNi4zNzU0OS5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwMi5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34034,"nextInTopic":34036,"prevInTime":34034,"nextInTime":34036,"topicId":33891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thankyou Sandra...

Luna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read that book too! I love reading about the &#39;Wild West&#39; - and<br/>\nwatching Westerns on TV and at the movies. Ever since I was about nine<br/>\nor ten when my family got our first TV. The first TV show I ever<br/>\nwatched in my life was an episode of The Cisco Kid. Then there were<br/>\nall the others - Bonanza, Maverick, Have Gun Will Travel, Rifleman,<br/>\nLaramie, Lone Ranger, Bronco, Range Rider, Wagon Train, Rawhide, High<br/>\nChaparral ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as I grew up I became interested in the real life history of the<br/>\nWild West, the true stories (or true-ish, depending on who was telling<br/>\nthe story!). And no chance of any of that finding its way into my<br/>\nschool classroom either. British history was it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so long ago, I spent a very informative half an hour or so with my<br/>\nson at the official Texas Rangers website (the law enforcement agency<br/>\nnot the baseball club) because we had been discussing the design of<br/>\nthe weapons in the shoot &#39;em up videogames he likes to play - and<br/>\nwhich guns are real guns and which are made up - and I&#39;d mentioned<br/>\nthat I loved the design of the Colt 1851 Navy pistol (as used by Clint<br/>\nEastwood in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly which we&#39;d watched not long<br/>\nbefore), so I googled it, found a page at the Texas Rangers site and<br/>\nwe stayed to have a look around.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly afterwards, I watched Kevin Costner&#39;s Wyatt Earp movie. I was<br/>\ncurious about how historically accurate the movie was and that led me<br/>\nto &#39;The Old West&#39; at a website called Legends of America<br/>\n(www.legendsofamerica.com) - &quot;Travel, History, Old West, Route 66,<br/>\nGhost Towns, Treasure Tales & More!&quot; I spent almost three hours there<br/>\nthe day I found it and still visit from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, a couple of years ago, I watched the Second World War<br/>\nmovie The Battle of the Bulge. I was pretty sure some liberties had<br/>\nbeen taken with the story, so I googled it and found a website - don&#39;t<br/>\nrecall now what it was called - that had been created by some guy in<br/>\nAmerica who had actually been there. It included a critique of the<br/>\nBattle of the Bulge movie that told me everything I needed to know<br/>\nabout the (numerous) discrepancies between the dramatised account and<br/>\nthe actual events. And there was a whole lot more. The website was a<br/>\nhuge, huge collection of real life stories, photos and maps related to<br/>\nthe battle that this guy had painstakingly put together over the space<br/>\nof years. I was so moved by it, I emailed the guy to thank him for all<br/>\nhis work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love all that. The internet is a dream come true for people of my<br/>\ngeneration (I&#39;m a &#39;child of the 1950s&#39;) - for those of us who wanted<br/>\nto know but had no way of knowing. I&#39;ve never been better educated in<br/>\nmy life than I have been over the past eight years. And the best<br/>\nthing of all is that I get to choose what&#39;s important to me and what<br/>\nisn&#39;t.

I also think in terms of 7 days a<br/>\n&gt; week not just Mon-Fri ... after all learning does happen 24/7.<br/>\n&gt; Again, I just observe what he&#39;s doing and jot it down. There will<br/>\n&gt; also be days that I miss so it&#39;s not a strict regimen either. I<br/>\n&gt; know there will be plenty of things at the end of the year to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;report&quot; on.

I have a son, now 12, at home with me who went to<br/>\nschool for two years. My wife and I took him out of school in December<br/>\n2002 at his request.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the &#39;school summer holiday&#39; that followed, we put together with<br/>\nhim a very informal, no need to sit at a desk, maximum three hours a<br/>\nday timetable of weekly &#39;lessons&#39; that he said he was happy with.<br/>\nSubject based - from memory, English, Mathematics, Science, Geography,<br/>\nHistory - not tied to a particular curriculum or syllabus.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn February 2003 (the start of the new school year), I wrote to the<br/>\nprincipal of the school officially confirming that my son wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nreturning to school and would be educated at home. I wrote to the<br/>\nDepartment of Schools and asked them to send me the registration<br/>\npackage so that I could register my son as home educated. I received<br/>\nthe package. I read through the forms. I decided that it was<br/>\nimpossible for me to adequately convey my educational philosophy in<br/>\nthe terms that they required and chucked the forms in the bin. I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad no further contact with the Department of Schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s &#39;lessons&#39; lasted about two weeks. And even in that time, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think we ever spent more than an hour on them before he decided<br/>\nto &#39;take the rest of the day off&#39;. Though he&#39;d agreed to the idea, in<br/>\npractice he didn&#39;t like it. If he didn&#39;t like it, nor did I. My wife<br/>\nand I had taken our son out of a situation that had made him unhappy<br/>\nbecause we wanted him to be happy, so we sure as heck weren&#39;t going to<br/>\nput him into another situation that made him unhappy. From that moment<br/>\non, my son has simply done what he likes. Mostly, that has been<br/>\nplaying videogames, watching TV and surfing the internet. (I do a lot<br/>\nof that with him too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his second year at school, my son had been in the remedial reading<br/>\nclass because his reading had fallen behind. I was a parent helper in<br/>\nthe reading program (I was inside his school in some way practically<br/>\nevery day) and he was constantly being compelled to read silly little<br/>\nstories about nothing he was even remotely interested in, so perhaps<br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t totally unrelated. When my son came out of school, he<br/>\nrefused to even look at a book and, to this day, he won&#39;t read one. By<br/>\nthe end of his first year at home, however, without any reading<br/>\nlessons whatsoever, my son&#39;s reading was excellent. He&#39;d dramatically<br/>\nimproved his reading from his everyday interactions with videogaming<br/>\ninstructions and online walkthroughs - stuff *he* knew he had to be<br/>\nable to read to achieve his gaming objectives. Interestingly, the<br/>\nnumber of times he asked me to identify a specific word for him was<br/>\nprobably in single digits. He really did figure virtually all of it<br/>\nout for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been many such revelations. The (positive) difference<br/>\nbetween what my 12 year old son knows about the world he lives in and<br/>\nwhat I knew about the world I lived in when I was 12 (which would be<br/>\n1964, btw) is  truly awesome. I have no doubt whatsoever that he&#39;s<br/>\nwell educated.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet he doesn&#39;t know - or, at least, he&#39;s unable to recite - the months<br/>\nof the year. Is that important? Perhaps a school teacher would be<br/>\nappalled! Well, we have calendars around the house if he needs to<br/>\ncheck; I listed the months on a sheet of paper and bluetacked it to<br/>\nhis bedroom wall for reference if he wants to glance at it every so<br/>\noften. I know that if he decides one day that he really *needs* to be<br/>\nable to recite the months of the year in order, he can permanently<br/>\nmemorise the sequence in less than half an hour. He didn&#39;t learn to<br/>\ntie his shoelaces until he was nine. I used to say to him, &quot;Pat, one<br/>\nday you&#39;ll wake up in the morning not knowing how to tie your<br/>\nshoelaces and you&#39;ll go to bed that night knowing how to tie your<br/>\nshoelaces. It really is that simple.&quot; One day he asked me to show him<br/>\nhow. So I showed him and he said, &quot;I can&#39;t see clearly what you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing&quot;; so I drew a set of six diagrams - very rough drawings of my<br/>\nactions. By following the diagrams, he tied his shoelaces, practised a<br/>\nfew times to be sure and that was it. Skill acquired.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing what children learn when they don&#39;t have education forced<br/>\non them. We all naturally want to be successful in our lives, so why<br/>\nwould they be an exception to that as many people seem to believe?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a daughter who&#39;s ten years older than her brother. She was<br/>\nalways formally educated in the school system and just graduated from<br/>\nuniversity this year. Before she started school, she lived exactly as<br/>\nher brother lives now - she did whatever she liked. After she started<br/>\nschool, that became a part-time lifestyle for when she was at home. In<br/>\nschool, she was a &quot;star pupil&quot; from day one, throughout her school<br/>\nyears always amongst what Robert Kiyosaki calls &quot;the favored five per<br/>\ncent&quot; - those students who are specially cared for because their<br/>\nachievements bring credit to the school. I&#39;m very grateful for that.<br/>\nIt enabled my daughter to successfully accommodate the less than life<br/>\nenhancing aspects of school culture. The incredible self-motivation on<br/>\nwhich her success at school was based didn&#39;t come from the school<br/>\nsystem though. It came from parents who honoured her self-authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo different in the case of our son, except that it&#39;s resulted in him<br/>\ntaking a very different path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point in mentioning my experiences with both of my children, I<br/>\nthink, is because I want to say that, as a parent, I believe my<br/>\nallegiance must be to the development of my children as human beings<br/>\nNOT to somebody else&#39;s ideas about how they would best fit into society.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I get a little emotional these days when I read of &#39;home<br/>\neducating&#39; parents who allow themselves to be pulled around by<br/>\nsupposed &#39;educational authorities&#39;. That&#39;s because I know from my own<br/>\nexperiences over eight years on the internet - and especially since<br/>\nthe advent of Web 2.0 - that we&#39;re now in a golden age of<br/>\nself-motivated learning that gifts today&#39;s growing children the power<br/>\nto create (should they choose to do so) an education of their own<br/>\nthat&#39;s superior to anything any Department of Schools wants for them;<br/>\nand because I&#39;ve spent the past five years observing the phenomenal<br/>\ndifference between my son&#39;s self-determined &#39;learning at the speed of<br/>\nthought&#39; lifestyle and the learning at the speed of watching paint dry<br/>\nexperiences he went through at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just some random neural firings in response to your post.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] can anyone answer these questions?","postDate":"1206981607","msgId":33913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4RDQzNDgyLTExMTUtNDFENy1CRDU5LTZFNDYyQzM5MDRCN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzMTc2Ni40MTc1MC5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwOC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDgzMTc2Ni40MTc1MC5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwOC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33911,"nextInTopic":33937,"prevInTime":33912,"nextInTime":33914,"topicId":33891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am reading through all the infomation on the site as i want to take things in!I-=- All the information on the site is too much.
