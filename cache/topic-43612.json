We didn&#39;t do formal phonics and reading with my two oldest, and they are both avid readers and self-learners.  We started out learning naturally, in everyday life.  (I guess we all do that when the children are very little, and then, with some, all of a sudden they hit school-age, and they stop.)  Great read.

Rosie <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any little sisters, but she has no need of an excuse to <br/>\nplay with whatever she feels like playing with. She&#39;s a very mature 18 <br/>\nyear old college student with a responsible job and a boyfriend. She <br/>\nwants some crayons and pattern blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE the way unschooled kids are growing up with such a childlike <br/>\nplayful enjoyment of things that other kids their ages would not even <br/>\nremotely be caught dead showing an interest in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it in all the unschooled young adults I know - not necessarily a <br/>\nlove for preschool art supplies &lt;G&gt;, but that childlike sweetness that <br/>\nhas survived within them.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, THAT is why we unschooled. Looking back I can see that that was <br/>\nit - call it &quot;love of learning&quot; but that doesn&#39;t really get to the core <br/>\nof it. It is more that an inner core of what it means to be human, a <br/>\nlove of LIFE, has been allowed to blossom instead of being destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - whew - that was a lot to say about dot markers, huh? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing in daycare will never be like unschooling, but it can be better or <br/>\nworse. It can crush that inner child-spirit in no time. So, I&#39;m happy to <br/>\nhear about it when a daycare provider is more enlightened.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Using unschooling in my business","postDate":"1238600844","msgId":43613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBRjQ0REE2LTQ0RkUtNDc4MS05MEE3LTExMzhBQkQ0NzI2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyMDFrcStsanEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdyMDFrcStsanEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43612,"nextInTopic":43618,"prevInTime":43612,"nextInTime":43614,"topicId":43612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Obviously I took the markers out for him to color with, but he used them a different way to teach himself about colors. -=- I LOVE our pattern blocks.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2100800147\">-=- Obviously I took the markers out for him to color with, but he  <br/>\nused them a different way to teach himself about colors. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE our pattern blocks.  They&#39;re flat, stained wood &quot;attribute  <br/>\nblock,&quot; and for me, the &quot;right way&quot; to use them is to make patterns  <br/>\nradiating out from a central point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty&#39;s &quot;right way&quot; was to make stacked designs, little sculptures.    <br/>\nSince then I&#39;ve used them that way too, but I tend to make artsy  <br/>\nfences, so they&#39;re rows standing up instead or row lying flat.  But  <br/>\nMarty&#39;s weren&#39;t on a plane that way.  He was using them like blocks,  <br/>\nWHICH THEY ARE!  But I saw them as flat shapes meant to be laid flat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe (I&#39;m not sure) it&#39;s because of school, and getting in trouble if  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t use things the way they were supposed to be used.  My mom was  <br/>\nthat way too, when I was little.  When she was older and all the kids  <br/>\nwere gone she started being pretty good at using things &quot;the wrong  <br/>\nway&quot;--more creative ways.   Maybe (I&#39;m not sure) she thought part of  <br/>\nbeing a mom was training kids to use things &quot;right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty used bungie cords in the back of his jeep to keep the back  <br/>\nwindow plastic safe from other things back there.  It&#39;s not &quot;what  <br/>\nbungie cords are for,&quot; but I&#39;ve used bungie cords in the house and in  <br/>\nthe yard for ALL kinds of things his whole life, and so from his point  <br/>\nof view, they&#39;re to be used however the heck one wants to!  So in that  <br/>\nway I think I&#39;ve moved away from my upbringing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336564039,"authorName":"jennifercroce37","from":"&quot;jennifercroce37&quot; &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt;","profile":"jennifercroce37","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Using unschooling in my business","postDate":"1238600154","msgId":43612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyMDFrcStsanEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43613,"prevInTime":43611,"nextInTime":43613,"topicId":43612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t mean to flood this group with posts, but I HAD to share this.

I run an organic home daycare and have a 21 month boy here today who was playing with the dot markers (they are like bingo markers).  On his own he took the caps and put them on the corresponding markers while looking at me trying to say the name of each color.  The look on his face when I encouraged him and acknowledged the great job he did was priceless.  He did this activity over and over again and now is off doing something else.  Obviously I took the markers out for him to color with, but he used them a different way to teach himself about colors.  It was pretty cool to realize and see the power unschooling in action!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43568,"nextTopicId":43670}}
