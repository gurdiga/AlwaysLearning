Is there anywhere nearby with a fountain? Hours of fun. Anything he can climb? A low wall or a tall curb for him to walk on? It can help to get down on the ground and look at the world from his perspective - what&#39;s interesting from down there? Take him places where there aren&#39;t a lot of people so he can run, and take him places where there are people so he can look at people and socialize if he wants. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On those days i  feel sad that my son does not like our nest<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter isn&#39;t a very social person, but when she was 2 she wanted to go out every day. So for awhile we went out every day - or nearly. It didn&#39;t matter where, for the most part. It might help to think that you&#39;re &quot;nest&quot; is so comfortable he&#39;s now ready to step out of it and explore, knowing the nest will be there when he gets back. That&#39;s one of the ways kids grow more independent - its a good thing! You&#39;ve made a nice safe place he can trust well enough to step away from. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our house is very small<br/>\n&gt; (48m2) so, any advice on having a busy todler inside is welcome. We have no deco objects or fourniture on the way.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you make a simple slide? Look for something smooth - a piece of counter-top, a piece of metal or plastic... depending on where you live you may be able to scavenge something. When my kids were little I had a piece of plastic pipe I got from a construction dumpster, about .75m across and maybe 1.5m long. It made a nice tunnel to crawl through, it could be rolled back and forth with a giggling child inside, and with one end propped up it was a slide. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for old mattresses and cushions, too. Those can be used to jump on, or to build with like giant blocks, draped with cloths to make tents or &quot;caves&quot; - and then stacked up in a corner out of the way or used as furniture. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] So many Unsolved things","postDate":"1316261500","msgId":62938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc3ODM3NDRCLUJBM0ItNDk3RS04NkJCLUYzOEI2RjYwQkFDMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMTYyMjYxMzIuNDk4MzIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMTYyMjYxMzIuNDk4MzIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62928,"nextInTopic":62949,"prevInTime":62937,"nextInTime":62939,"topicId":62928,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
