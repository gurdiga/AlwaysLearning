We also got her hooked up for &#39;structured Biology&#39; to satisfy what is considered the typical body of knowledge that is called &#39;Biology&#39; but it is secondary to her living her life now.... and she is glad to be &#39;preparing for options in the future&#39; so I&#39;ll support her in that, too....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31989,"nextTopicId":32046}}
