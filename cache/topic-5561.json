It&#39;s understanding the impact that one statement <br/>\nmade 100 years ago can have on present day society. It&#39;s flipping numbers <br/>\naround because we need the result it will bring. It&#39;s about being in the <br/>\nworld today and learning what we need for today.

If you spend it studying ancient <br/>\nhistory, then there is something else you&#39;re not doing. There is ALWAYS an <br/>\nopportunity cost to every decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you decide to have the kids do just a little of something formal - then <br/>\nthat means there is just that same little bit of time they aren&#39;t doing what <br/>\nelse they would have done during that time. It is always going to be a <br/>\ntradeoff. Heck, its a trade-off when I ask my kids to unload the dishwasher <br/>\nor set the table or pick up their clothes, too. The question for unschoolers <br/>\nis what are the benefits of insisting the kids do just a bit of studying a <br/>\nsubject of the parents&#39; choosing versus the costs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits - I guess - are like this last post said - the kids learned <br/>\nsomething that they would maybe not have gotten interested in and now they <br/>\nARE interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe costs? I&#39;ll toss that one out to the rest of the list - we&#39;ll probably <br/>\nhave a lengthy list of costs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNumber one, for me, is that it is unnecessary. Parents can &quot;offer&quot; stuff and <br/>\nparents can &quot;learn&quot; about stuff and share what they are learning with their <br/>\nkids and be excited about something and draw the kids into it, too, and the <br/>\nkids can often be attracted/enticed to something that the parents want them <br/>\nto learn about. If not, then they aren&#39;t likely to get all that much out of <br/>\nit if the parents insist on it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I think, &quot;Gee, my daughter ought to learn some American history,&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;Wow - here is a really great history series (say, History of Us by Joy <br/>\nHakim)&quot; then I can certainly offer it to her in a way that seems to me to be <br/>\nmost likely to catch her interest. (Often I&#39;ll say, &quot;Here - let me read you <br/>\nsome of this - it is very cool.&quot;) If she likes it - we&#39;ll go on. If, at some <br/>\npoint, she says, &quot;Mom, this is boring,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just not interested in this&quot; <br/>\nor whatever, then it&#39;ll get put aside. Or I might say, &quot;Okay - hey - how <br/>\nabout I read it to you at bedtime instead?&quot; Because just maybe she does like <br/>\nit but doesn&#39;t like it to take up precious daytime hours. Who knows? MAYBE <br/>\nshe just isn&#39;t going to be interested - that is something I have to judge as <br/>\nher parent - when to just let go of something that I MYSELF thought was going <br/>\nto be cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"ddzimlew@juno.com","from":"ddzimlew@...","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My ramble","postDate":"1016678257","msgId":5628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzIwLjE5Mzk1NS4tMzE1OTcuMC5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5627,"nextInTopic":5631,"prevInTime":5627,"nextInTime":5629,"topicId":5561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My kids spend<br/>\n&gt; months looking like they&#39;re doing nothing,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes, and then have<br/>\n&gt; explosions of intense focus on specific<br/>\n&gt; things. There has been little to<br/>\n&gt; nothing that looks like regular,<br/>\n&gt; progresive, systematic learning of any<br/>\n&gt; particular subjects - but somehow they seem<br/>\n&gt; to know stuff. Now that they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; older, they aren&#39;t really unschooling, I<br/>\n&gt; guess, since they take college<br/>\n&gt; courses - my 17 yo has about 60 units of<br/>\n&gt; college work - all her GE<br/>\n&gt; requirements finished except math (along<br/>\n&gt; with a lot of art classes). Even<br/>\n&gt; though we never did formal studies - no<br/>\n&gt; history, math, science, etc., she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have any &quot;gaps&quot; in her<br/>\n&gt; background knowledge to hinder her in<br/>\n&gt; her college courses.

Really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roxana, who is 14 (hi Rox) has just started<br/>\n&gt; to take a few courses at the<br/>\n&gt; college - a website design class, an<br/>\n&gt; introduction to opera (studying about<br/>\n&gt; it, not performing), and a beginning voice<br/>\n&gt; class. She was nervous about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;going to college,&quot; worried about things<br/>\n&gt; like note taking and writing essays<br/>\n&gt; for exams, but she&#39;s doing really well -<br/>\n&gt; really happy with the classes and<br/>\n&gt; learning a LOT and, as it turns out,<br/>\n&gt; getting good grades too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 11 yo has a friend who is in a public<br/>\n&gt; school homeschooling program. She<br/>\n&gt; has to turn in work samples every month. So<br/>\n&gt; Rosie (my 11 yo) was spending the<br/>\n&gt; night at her friend&#39;s house and her friend<br/>\n&gt; had to do a bunch of workbook<br/>\n&gt; stuff so she&#39;d have some work samples to<br/>\n&gt; turn in. They decided to play school<br/>\n&gt; - and Rosie did the worksheets too. It was<br/>\n&gt; pretty dismal. The other mom was<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;teacher&quot; and she marked wrong all the<br/>\n&gt; math questions and spelling words<br/>\n&gt; that Rosie missed. There were a LOT of<br/>\n&gt; them. I was kind of annoyed by the<br/>\n&gt; whole thing - because I didn&#39;t want Rosie<br/>\n&gt; getting the feeling she&#39;s &quot;behind&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or something. I&#39;m not worried about her -<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s fine - she knows a LOT of<br/>\n&gt; stuff and can simply THINK way more clearly<br/>\n&gt; than the other girl - even if she<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t spell &lt;G&gt;. The time the other girl<br/>\n&gt; has spent doing worksheets, Rosie<br/>\n&gt; has spent on things she&#39;s INTERESTED in.<br/>\n&gt; So, for example, the worksheets<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t &quot;test&quot; knowledge of the geography of<br/>\n&gt; the world - it isn&#39;t part of the<br/>\n&gt; 5th grade curriculum &lt;G&gt;. But Rosie knows a<br/>\n&gt; LOT about world geography - more<br/>\n&gt; than many adults, probably. Why? Because<br/>\n&gt; she LOVES soccer and follows<br/>\n&gt; international soccer - follows teams from<br/>\n&gt; Europe and South America, mostly,<br/>\n&gt; but also is very very aware of other<br/>\n&gt; countries because of the World Cup<br/>\n&gt; qualifying rounds going on all over the<br/>\n&gt; world right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - she knows interesting information<br/>\n&gt; about lots of countries in the world,<br/>\n&gt; but didn&#39;t know how to multiply multiple<br/>\n&gt; digit decimal numbers. It hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; come up. Big deal - she can learn that in<br/>\n&gt; minutes - and will, I&#39;m sure, one<br/>\n&gt; of these days, because it&#39;ll come up and<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll want to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Pam S<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have<br/>\n&gt; been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            Yahoo!

There has been little to <br/>\nnothing that looks like regular, progresive, systematic learning of any <br/>\nparticular subjects - but somehow they seem to know stuff. Now that they&#39;re <br/>\nolder, they aren&#39;t really unschooling, I guess, since they take college <br/>\ncourses - my 17 yo has about 60 units of college work - all her GE <br/>\nrequirements finished except math (along with a lot of art classes). Even <br/>\nthough we never did formal studies - no history, math, science, etc., she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to have any &quot;gaps&quot; in her background knowledge to hinder her in <br/>\nher college courses. In fact, she says that she feels like she usually knows <br/>\na LOT more than most of the other students. If you asked her where she <br/>\nlearned the stuff, she&#39;d say, &quot;From reading, traveling, talking to people, <br/>\nwatching movies and tv, whatever....&quot;. Hard to really say where it came from <br/>\n- just from life. Really.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana, who is 14 (hi Rox) has just started to take a few courses at the <br/>\ncollege - a website design class, an introduction to opera (studying about <br/>\nit, not performing), and a beginning voice class. She was nervous about <br/>\n&quot;going to college,&quot; worried about things like note taking and writing essays <br/>\nfor exams, but she&#39;s doing really well - really happy with the classes and <br/>\nlearning a LOT and, as it turns out, getting good grades too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 yo has a friend who is in a public school homeschooling program. She <br/>\nhas to turn in work samples every month. So Rosie (my 11 yo) was spending the <br/>\nnight at her friend&#39;s house and her friend had to do a bunch of workbook <br/>\nstuff so she&#39;d have some work samples to turn in. They decided to play school <br/>\n- and Rosie did the worksheets too. It was pretty dismal. The other mom was <br/>\nthe &quot;teacher&quot; and she marked wrong all the math questions and spelling words <br/>\nthat Rosie missed. There were a LOT of them. I was kind of annoyed by the <br/>\nwhole thing - because I didn&#39;t want Rosie getting the feeling she&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; <br/>\nor something. I&#39;m not worried about her - she&#39;s fine - she knows a LOT of <br/>\nstuff and can simply THINK way more clearly than the other girl - even if she <br/>\ncan&#39;t spell &lt;G&gt;. The time the other girl has spent doing worksheets, Rosie <br/>\nhas spent on things she&#39;s INTERESTED in. So, for example, the worksheets <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;test&quot; knowledge of the geography of the world - it isn&#39;t part of the <br/>\n5th grade curriculum &lt;G&gt;. But Rosie knows a LOT about world geography - more <br/>\nthan many adults, probably. Why? Because she LOVES soccer and follows <br/>\ninternational soccer - follows teams from Europe and South America, mostly, <br/>\nbut also is very very aware of other countries because of the World Cup <br/>\nqualifying rounds going on all over the world right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - she knows interesting information about lots of countries in the world, <br/>\nbut didn&#39;t know how to multiply multiple digit decimal numbers. It hasn&#39;t <br/>\ncome up. Big deal - she can learn that in minutes - and will, I&#39;m sure, one <br/>\nof these days, because it&#39;ll come up and she&#39;ll want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Pam S<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My ramble","postDate":"1016603702","msgId":5585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwLjE5MjYxYmZjLjI5Yzk3ZTM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5581,"nextInTopic":5588,"prevInTime":5584,"nextInTime":5586,"topicId":5561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/19/02 10:57:36 AM Mountain Standard Time, ...
