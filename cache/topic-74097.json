I was lucky to find a dentist who accepted the damage as where his teeth were at and did not shame me or him or make candy or anything else the enemy.

My youngest daughter eats just as much sugar, and brushes her teeth far less often, and has had no damage to her teeth at all. My oldest daughter has a similar brushing record to LiAM and also has no damage. So the damage is not related to sugar or to tooth brushing - it&#39;s more to do with genetics and/or LiAM&#39;s own personal make up. I had gastro quite badly several times when I was pregnant with him, so it&#39;s possible that those times coincided with when his enamel was forming and it didn&#39;t form properly. Or it may be that all the asthma medication has weakened it. I don&#39;t really care what the cause is - I&#39;d prefer to encourage brushing and make it a happy experience, but not get too hung up on it, and look after each of my kid&#39;s teeth as needed (take them for regular check ups and deal with problems when/if they arise, rather than worrying about what might go wrong)</div><div><br></div><div>Annie</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130276955,"authorName":"Juliet Kemp","from":"Juliet Kemp &lt;juliet@...&gt;","profile":"julietkemp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When children don&#39;t make healthy choices","postDate":"1398429449","msgId":74120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxOEI2NzkyLTVDNTItNDlFRC05QkNDLUZERTkxMTExNDQxRkBlYXJ0aC5saT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzOTgzODM0MjQuMzMwMDEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NDkwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGxqOGFuOCs4amNqNjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM5ODM1NjY0My4xMzMwMi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTg0OTAyLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDVGRjBGQUUwLUQyMjYtNDgwNS1CMjlDLTg3NTVBNjNDQjQyNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGxqYnIwMis5aWI2OWRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM5ODM4MzQyNC4zMzAwMS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTg0OTA1Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74119,"nextInTopic":74130,"prevInTime":74119,"nextInTime":74121,"topicId":74097,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I find being with other people fun, but draining. A classic extrovert would get energy from being with others. And of course many/most people have a little bit of both - and even I find social time is energising in some ways even as it is also exhausting!

Guilt often indicates someone who sees the outcome of their choices as a reflection on them personally. They&#39;re good and right as a person when things turn out. They&#39;re bad and wrong when things don&#39;t.</div><div><br></div><div>That way of thinking makes it much harder to work towards making better choices. That way of thinking turns life into a constant effort to guess the &quot;right&quot; answer. Seemingly the only way to make better choices is to just know the rules and the right answers.</div><div><br></div><div>If that way of thinking sounds familiar, it will help to see *all* outcomes as feedback. &nbsp;That feedback will help you understand what parts of your solution are working and why, what parts aren&#39;t working and why. From that you can tweak your approach.</div><div><br></div><div>But it you can&#39;t dissociate your self-worth from how your choices turn out, it&#39;s going to be really really hard to make progressively better choices.</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote type=\"cite\">And, honestly he is on the iPad all day.&nbsp;</blockquote><br></div><div>You&#39;re still calling what he&#39;s doing &quot;on the iPad,&quot; even though you have a &quot;deep connection.&quot; What&#39;s he *doing* on the iPad?

You *say* you join them in their passions, but you wording says you have no idea what he&#39;s doing or why he enjoys doing it. It&#39;s just 11 hours of &quot;iPad&quot;.

But kids do grow and change. Growth rate -- and food needs -- are fast and high at the beginning, then they slow down, then kids gather energy pre-puberty growing a bit round then shoot up for another growth. (Generally.) So it could be he doesn&#39;t need as much fuel as he used to.</div><div><br></div><div>An option suggested was bringing breakfast to him. Then spend some time with him, asking about what&#39;s going on in his world. Make it a point to touch base with him *several* times a day. Bring the laundry to where he is to fold it. Ask him to bring his iPad with you and fill you in on what&#39;s been going on.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe you&#39;re defining &quot;deep connection&quot; differently than I do. Maybe you mean something vague like &quot;loving bond&quot; or something. Here, when discussing radical unschooling, it needs to mean knowing who your child is, understanding his current interests, being attuned to his needs.

To make those easier to choose, kids need parents to create a more level playing field.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to assume they&#39;re doing the best they can. And if they need to do better, there&#39;s something in the way. Get to know them. What&#39;s bothering them. Work on what&#39;s in the way rather than working on them.

What kind of things is he doing on the iPad? What does he enjoy about those things? What are his favorites?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you join him? Do you get to know him better by getting to know better what he loves? Do you play with him? Do  you let him show you what he&#39;s discovering and excited about? Do you ask questions to understand his interest (and him) better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is totally addicted,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s not addicted.

He&#39;s only 7! These tasks that adults see as simple aren&#39;t so simple when you&#39;re a kid! Or let him sleep in his clothes?

Why can&#39;t he take the iPad?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s an introvert in a home of extroverts, it can feel to him like he&#39;s *always* leaving. (And feel to the extroverts like you&#39;re *always* at home.) Some families have found it helpful to have days scheduled for going out and days scheduled for staying in.

If the &quot;healthy choices&quot; are harder, more irritating, have too many roadblocks, there are other factors that are skewing their decisions. Be more with them. Create a nurturing nest where better choices *feel* better and aren&#39;t just annoying and self-depriving.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":360440773,"authorName":"Greg and Kirsty Harriman","from":"&quot;Greg and Kirsty Harriman&quot; &lt;kgharriman1@...&gt;","profile":"kirsty_harriman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When children don&#39;t make healthy choices","postDate":"1398338643","msgId":74100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ2N0ZCMzA3NkYzNDQ1NTE4QUU4MTY3RkI1Qjc2QzlCQEhhcnJpbWFuPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGxqOGFuOCs4amNqNjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxqOGFuOCs4amNqNjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74099,"nextInTopic":74101,"prevInTime":74099,"nextInTime":74101,"topicId":74097,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How long has your son had unlimited access to the Ipad?

Is\nthis a new thing or has it always been there? Does he rise at 7 am and spend 11\nhours on it literally every single day or does it just seem like that to you?\nWhat’s he doing on his ipad? </font><font size=\"4\">Some days when I feel like one\nof my children has done nothing else except choose to watch television or sat at\nthe computer all day, when I look at it I realise that its not all day at all.\nIts only a few hours and the rest of the time they’ve been playing and doing\nother things. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Restricting your son’s ipad use might turn it into (or back\ninto) a ‘forbidden fruit’ that will then seem that much more attractive and\nstrengthen his desire to use it?</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">When our eldest daughter received an ipod for Christmas she\ntoo would rise and be on it for what felt like hours through January and\nFebruary doing games and watching Barbie movies. I felt like we never saw her\nanymore and she would never do anything else. I found this really tough and felt\nlike I was losing her.&nbsp; Well four months later she’s choosing to do lots of\nother things again and I don’t often see her on her ipod now. Its become another\nchoice. (I will add that it was 40 degrees outside then and its not now, which \ncould have had an influencing factor why she spent so much time inside on her\nipod in the air conditioning)</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font style=\"\">I note that I am talking about our daughter here and\nyour daughter makes choices that don’t concern you as your son’s do. Maybe boys\nand girls are wired differently when it comes to things like ipads? Perhaps boys\nfind these things harder to leave alone?</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">With having breakfast and getting dressed, why is it important\nto you that your son has breakfast and gets dressed by a certain time if you’re\nnot going anywhere and have food available for when he’s hungry? </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">I have found our mornings have become a lot slower and\n‘driftier’ without pushing for them to eat breakfast or get dressed. They will\ndo these things when they’re ready or if we are going somewhere. If something\ninteresting is happening on the computer or television it might be 9 or 10\nbefore they do these things. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">I am pretty new to unschooling and I have been really working\non exactly these things that you have written about in recent months. Its been a\nreally confronting time of letting go and facilitating free choices around food\nand tv and computers after quite strong limits for a number of years. I can say\nnow that I am seeing a whole lot more balance happening in our lives and that\nthey do choose many different things within a 24 hour period when there’s choice\navailable. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>\n<div\n style='FONT-SIZE:small;TEXT-DECORATION:none;FONT-FAMILY:\"Calibri\";FONT-WEIGHT:normal;COLOR:#000000;FONT-STYLE:normal;DISPLAY:inline;'></div>\n<div style=\"FONT:10pt tahoma;\">\n<div style=\"BACKGROUND:#f5f5f5;\">\n<div style=\"\"><b>From:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"luminara.king@...\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luminara.king@...\">luminara.king@...</a> </div>\n<div><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 23, 2014 10:12 PM</div>\n<div><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\n</div>\n<div><b>Subject:</b> [AlwaysLearning] When children don&#39;t make healthy\nchoices</div></div></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div></div>\n<div\n style='FONT-SIZE:small;TEXT-DECORATION:none;FONT-FAMILY:\"Calibri\";FONT-WEIGHT:normal;COLOR:#000000;FONT-STYLE:normal;DISPLAY:inline;'><span\n style=\"DISPLAY:none;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-444866584ygrp-text\">\n<p>\n<p><span>Hi,&nbsp; we have been unschooling our 12 yr old daughter and 7 yr old\nson for four years and I have noticed that they have very different\ntemperaments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our daughter has always been able to make healthy\nchoices for herself (well, mostly) but our son can not.&nbsp; Our son has always\nhated brushing his teeth but loves to eat surgery treats daily, because we were\ntrying to respect his own choices we didn&#39;t push him to brush his teeth only\nexplained why it was important to do so.&nbsp; Four years on, he has terrible\ntooth decay and is due to go to hospital to be put asleep to have four teeth\nremoved, he has also suffered many painful abscess.&nbsp; How can we stand by\nand watch our son in this pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like I had let him down by\nneglecting my duty of care of him as his parent, all because I wanted to respect \nhis choices and not &quot;make&quot; him brush his teeth.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Another example is our son&#39;s iPad use.&nbsp; He is totally addicted, he\nrises at 7.00am and goes straight on the IPad and then it is a struggle to get\nhim to have breakfast and get dressed or go out and do anything else all\nday.&nbsp; If we do not intervene he stays on the iPad for 11 hours without a\nbreak and looks really ill.&nbsp; Our son has never been to school and has never\nhad any limits placed on him.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So we are now feeling we have no choice but to set limits.&nbsp; Today is a\ngood example, we explained to our son that we are concerned about his computer\nuse and that we are going to limit the time he is on the iPad to 6 hrs a day\n(not bad as many of his friends are only allow an hour a day!).&nbsp; At first\nhe want crazy, kicking, screaming, throwing things around.&nbsp; I just contined\nto calmly explain why we needed to do this.&nbsp; After, 30 mins without his\niPad he started to engaged and play with his sister, went out on the trampoline\nand I can hear him now happily creating and playing with his Lego in his room.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the brushing of his teeth, after trying everything, we have resort to\na consequence of stating that we will not take part in giving him more pain by\nbuying him candy unless he brushes his teeth&nbsp; twice a day. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>oh yes, and the other day our daughter did say to me &quot; Mum, please help me\nstop eating candy, I can&#39;t do it myself and my skin is getting really\nbad).&nbsp; </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So maybe us parents do need to take &quot;Charge&quot; sometimes and set limits because\nare not always able to make healthy choices. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would like to hear other people&#39;s experiences </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Luminara x</p></div></div></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":549443766,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;luminara.king@...&gt;","profile":"luminaraking","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"When children don&#39;t make healthy choices","postDate":"1398255144","msgId":74097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxqOGFuOCs4amNqNjFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74098,"prevInTime":74096,"nextInTime":74098,"topicId":74097,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi,  we have been unschooling our 12 yr old daughter and 7 yr old son for four years and I have noticed that they have very different temperaments.
