I<br/>\ngive her half the profit on stuff she finds, or she can buy it herself<br/>\nand I&#39;ll help her list it and she gets all the profit. Between her<br/>\nallowance, the money she made off a brownie outfit and some Barney<br/>\nvideos, money she made selling doughnuts at our yard sale, and money she<br/>\nmade just selling her stuff at our yard sale, she&#39;s up to $30 saved,<br/>\nwhich is just amazing her.. generally money runs through her fingers like<br/>\nwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did say yesterday that she wants to buy a rocking horse for a<br/>\nfriend&#39;s birthday next month, they were talking on the phone and her<br/>\nfriend said she wanted one.
