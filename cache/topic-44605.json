It&#39;s a product of wanting our kids to get the best from  <br/>\nlife. The most natural way to stop someone from doing what we think  <br/>\nis wrong is to control them.

If that sounds too hard because of a  <br/>\nlifetime of baggage, realize that your daughter is watching you and  <br/>\npicking up how to relate to people through how you&#39;re relating to  <br/>\nyour mother. She&#39;s seeing adversarial relationships as something you  <br/>\naccept as normal.

We used to have a really nice, friendship-y relationship, but she can barely speak to me now. It&#39;s really sad to me, but I can&#39;t control it. I can&#39;t make her understand. My responsibility is to myself and my family. If someone were to be outwardly antagonistic toward my son or me, I would definitely put an end to that. And I wouldn&#39;t have them over to my house at all. <br/>\n~~Juillet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":396473338,"authorName":"ellinghamsandwich","from":"&quot;ellinghamsandwich&quot; &lt;ellinghamsandwich@...&gt;","profile":"ellinghamsandwich","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: My Mom thinks I joined a cult","postDate":"1241235273","msgId":44616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0Z2YwOSthdmd2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NkRCOEJFLTE4MzEtNDcwMS04OEYwLTBCOTk5NzQ5QTI2REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44613,"nextInTopic":44617,"prevInTime":44615,"nextInTime":44617,"topicId":44605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i just read the second half of your post, marcy, and your reply, sandra...i can really identify w/ so much you said marcy...every word, actually. the only","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-120714000\">i just read the second half of your post, marcy, and your reply, sandra...i can really identify w/ so much you said marcy...every word, actually. the only difference is i have no husband and i LIVE w/ my mother. she financially supports us right now... ugh. <br/>\n<br/>\nmy mother has been thinking of herself as the other parent...i had been allowing this but now that she is opposing my decision to US the kids i have let her know that *I* and the parent here and *I* make those sort of decisions... as i&#39;ve shared, she puts her fears out there and its just nuts, really. i have to keep reminding her that these are MY children and blah blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy mother thinks my daughter plays us against one another. my daughter will side w/ me or w/ my mom... example...this afternoon my mom was making mac &#39;n cheese for lunch while i nursed my son, for megh. when she went to mix it she had this huge chunk of butter (must have been like 4 tbsp...) and like 1/4 c. of milk...i don&#39;t do it that way and she knows it. i know she meant well but i was having a fit as i&#39;m trying to lose weight...she said well i&#39;ve already mixed it (butter) w/ the milk so... so my daughter says &#39;yeah, nanny...we don&#39;t make it that way, nanny...&#39; and my mom was getting so upset w/ my daughter... then my mom goes to stir it & i hear my daughter tell her that that is not the one to use (spoon)... my mom looks at me and says &#39;that&#39;s IT, lisbeth. this needs to STOP. this is NOT OK!&#39;. and i&#39;m sitting there looking at her like &#39;what do u want me to do about it?&#39; my daughter was voicing her feelings and standing by the way she knows how to make our version of mac &#39;n cheese. i didn&#39;t feel i needed to stop my daughter for her &#39;disrespect&#39;... what else could i have done??? after a while i did tell megh to stop. she backed off. really she is picking up on the tension betw my mother and i lately............ my mom goes into major panic/phobic mode when stressed and i go into...well, many modes. lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nits hard to stand up to our mothers...we have lived so long obeying them and doing things their way to make them happy until we lose ourselves...then when we recover ourselves they don&#39;t like it and want us to change back. what is up w/ that? don&#39;t they want us to live our lives OUR way? why don&#39;t so many moms support this in their children? lack of trust in their children and in themselves...? this is nuts. it really gives me a headache and...sigh. yeah. maybe its easier when a person is 50 or 60 but i just feel like i&#39;m struggling so much lately to break out of this dysfunction with my mother and stay OUT. i don&#39;t want to live thru her anymore. i wnat her to honor this. as soon as i start to feel good about myself and my choices as an adult, its like she doesn&#39;t like that...even though she says she wants the best for me and my kids...i guess cuz it isn&#39;t &#39;her&#39; way...??? if i&#39;m happy and motivated she calls it manic. whatever!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nsandra, i wish it were that simple to just stand up to our moms and say that&#39;s the way it is. like or not. they can think what they want to think. have you experienced something similar w/ your mother? i really admire your integrity. i want mine back...full fletch, baby! i say................tawanda!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-she was over the house today and tried to interfere with a project  <br/>\n&gt; my daughter was doing,my daughter got upset and said I want to do  <br/>\n&gt; it,my mom continued to show her &quot;the right way&quot; and my daughter got  <br/>\n&gt; upset and said I like my way better and then when she didnt let up,  <br/>\n&gt; she said &quot;I want you to leave Grandma&quot;. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now another angle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HOW did she continue, at your house, to do something your daughter  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t like?

This one has blown my mind for<br/>\nsome time now. even though my kids started out in public school (we just<br/>\nstarted homeschooling this year), I never saw the need to send them to<br/>\npre-k. it&#39;s so much fun teaching them their abc&#39;s and how to wait their turn<br/>\nin line and the different colors, shapes, and numbers that I couldn&#39;t fathom<br/>\nsending them somewhere for someone else to teach those things to them! If<br/>\nyou ask me, pre-k is just a nice way of saying daycare so that mom can have<br/>\na break! I know so many stay at home moms that send their kids to pre-k or<br/>\npre-school, as young as 3. these kids are no better off when they start<br/>\nkindergarten than those kids who stayed home with their moms and played<br/>\ngames, went to story time at the library, learned how to play with other<br/>\nkids at the park and play dates. it really is a sore subject with me! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOff my soapbox now. it blows my mind that your family would be upset with<br/>\nyou for pulling your daughter out of pre-k! You have to do what&#39;s right for<br/>\nyou and your husband and your kids. if your extended family can&#39;t accept it,<br/>\nI would try not to lose sleep over it. It&#39;s hard, I know. but ultimately<br/>\nwhat matters is raising your kids the way you know they should be raised. I<br/>\nthink in the end most people come around.
