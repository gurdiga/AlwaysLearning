And my parents asked to learn more.  I&#39;m going to give <br/>\nthem the web address so they can read about the topics to be spoken on. <br/>\n I really hope they&#39;ll all come.  Unfortunately, dh can&#39;t because <br/>\nthey&#39;ll just be starting the harvest.

We&#39;ll see....  In regards to my mom,      she doesn&#39;t bring up the schooling much.   She says she trusts me.    But when she does, she tends to take things I say as a personal attack on her own parenting skills.   I try and say,  I know you did what you thought was best,  but that doesn&#39;t always help.  I also have to be zenlike.   I take lots of breathes and calm myself.     This week I was over there,  at her house,  and she thought the kids needed more &#39;guidance&#39;.  In other words,  needing me to tell them what to do. I said they were doing quite well in finding lots to do and finding new things that they hadn&#39;t done before.    They also are so happy and self assured.   They get to do what they want!          She also can&#39;t get over the unregulated TV/ gaming stuff.    I brought up,  &quot;I sure am glad Steven Spielberg&#39;s mom didn&#39;t limit his use of a video camera! &quot; Or &quot; I&#39;m glad Bill Gate&#39;s mom didin&#39;t say to him,  honey, you&#39;ve been on the computer too much!&quot;.   She thinks my son has become more reclusive,  like he doesn&#39;t talk to people as much anymore. Well,   when she was last at our house he had just gotten a gameboy advance from a friend.   Hmmmmm,  I wonder why he didn&#39;t talk much.   Plus she doesn&#39;t talk to him about anything he&#39;s interested in.   I also said maybe he doesn&#39;t have anything to say.   Maybe he isn&#39;t going to be a talkative person,  isn&#39;t that OK? That&#39;s a  huge point,   if my kids don&#39;t talk with adults about what  the adults  think is &#39;interesting&#39; or of &#39;importance&#39;,   well,  then they aren&#39;t learning anything!      Sigh...    And of course,  video games can&#39;t be of importance.  I told my Mom if she would ask him about what he was doing she wouldn&#39;t be able to get a word in edge wise,  but she doesn&#39;t do that. I think she would rather he sat down and showed her how nice his handwriting is...how to multiply..and etc...bleck..that would impress her.    Different priorities,  I&#39;d say.  I just stay confident in my decision to unschool.   And show the doubters how wonderful it all is!!   Kelli <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
