It&#39;s interesting how much I rely on those visual clues when &#39;mapping&#39; a place in my head. I now want to practice mapping without borders - it&#39;s challenging &lt;g&gt;. <br/>\nDh just came by and read my post. He pointed out, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s the way you drive and give directions. Using landmarks to visually mark the way. Like take a left at the Jack In The Box, etc.&quot; I guess that&#39;s just one more confirmation of my visual style!<br/>\nLove the game, btw.
