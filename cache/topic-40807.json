Most kids seem to be able<br/>\nto shake off these situations and move on, but my DD (Pearl) is just<br/>\nnot able to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if she could change this about herself, she would.  I<br/>\noften see her fighting back tears. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s difficult for her, and I see the effect it has on others.  I know<br/>\ntears make most adults uncomfortable, and often folks try to fix the<br/>\nproblem or kind of talk her out of crying, which doesn&#39;t usually help. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could be wrong, but judging from body language, I&#39;m feeling like<br/>\nsome of the other kids are thinking &quot;here she goes again&quot; when Pearl<br/>\nstarts to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy immediate concern is that Pearl has decided she wants to be in a<br/>\nplay that our homeschool group is doing.  Today they had an acting<br/>\nworkshop for those who are interested in auditioning.  They played an<br/>\nacting game at the workshop.  The director asked who&#39;d like to<br/>\nparticipate (it was something where one kid would join in, later<br/>\nanother, then another.) Pearl thought everyone would be called on to<br/>\nparticipate.  The director thought everyone who wanted to participate<br/>\nwould volunteer.  So what ended up happening was that Pearl was never<br/>\ncalled on and never volunteered and did not get a chance to be in the<br/>\ngame.  This made her cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a typical example of what brings her to tears.  The director<br/>\nwas very nice, and even apologized for the lack of clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always said yes to whatever the kids wanted to participate in.<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been sure to let Pearl know just what to expect, where I<br/>\ncould foresee possible injustices that might occur, and ask her if she<br/>\nthought she could handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m wondering if I should tell her that I think she should not be<br/>\nin the play (which is how I&#39;m feeling right now.) I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nshe&#39;ll be able to handle the feedback, (slow down, speak louder, etc.)<br/>\nand there are bound to be situations that come up that she does not<br/>\nagree with, and she&#39;s likely to cry.  I&#39;m just feeling like it&#39;s not<br/>\nworth it, that the positives couldn&#39;t possibly outweigh the negatives.<br/>\n I also think the director is going to have enough on her plate<br/>\nwithout the added complication of a not-so-easy-going actress in the<br/>\nshow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hesitate to do a &quot;try it and see how it goes&quot; thing, because if she<br/>\nis cast, it&#39;s not cool to drop out, it affects the other people in the<br/>\nshow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any wisdom, advice, that you can offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40809,"nextTopicId":40729}}
