I have known<br/>\nmany people to follow the advice of a doctor and that advice is nothing<br/>\nmore than folk wisdom and superstitious learning.  I love the look on a<br/>\ndoctor&#39;s face when I ask if they can tell me about the research that<br/>\nsupports their advice.  The ones that respond with information and aren&#39;t<br/>\ndefensive are the ones that I return to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never understood the idea of limiting and deprivation as a means of<br/>\nprotecting.  My son had definite reactions to yellow 5 that were really<br/>\nscary starting at just about age 3.  The first year or so, we just didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave yellow 5 around and I started reading.  There are countries out there<br/>\nthat have banned tartrazine&#39;s use because there are good studies pointing<br/>\nto it being toxic.  There are lots of good substitutes for yellow things<br/>\nand things with yellow in them.  By the time he was 4.5, we had been<br/>\ntalking to him about yellow 5 and how he had reactions to it for a little<br/>\nmore than 18 months--nearly half his life.   He started making decisions.<br/>\nOnce he had some cheese curls with yellow 5 and he could actually verbalize<br/>\nthat he felt &#39;buzzy&#39; (I think he was about 5) and from then until he was<br/>\nabout 10, he would always either ask one of the adults or later check<br/>\nhimself for the yellow 5.  When he was 10 at a fencing match, he grabbed<br/>\nand &#39;chugged&#39; a mellow yellow soda because he was really hot.  He proceeded<br/>\nto have a reaction and felt unsteady and &#39;weird&#39; for the rest of the day.<br/>\nFrom then on he was very diligent and I rarely checked for it myself,<br/>\nunless I was reading the label in general.  (I have always been a label<br/>\nreader).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that he is much bigger and older, he still avoids yellow 5 most of the<br/>\ntime, but hasn&#39;t had a reaction that he has noticed in several years.  We<br/>\njust talked about this and he postulated that it may be that he is much<br/>\nbigger and the amount of yellow 5 is the same.  He still avoids it, but he<br/>\nmakes this decision on his own.  If he were incapable of understanding the<br/>\ncause and effect relationship, then I might step in, but he is a bright and<br/>\nintelligent young man who makes his own decisions, even about allergens and<br/>\nwhen and if to take medication for simple sinus issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI give information and advice sometimes, but I don&#39;t &#39;direct&#39; him to do<br/>\nanything, even when he has circles under his eyes because of his sinuses.<br/>\nI will ask him if he realizes that the circles are there because he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnotice.  Just as I asked my daughter what she had been using to clean her<br/>\nface because she looked like she had hives and we all have sensitive skin.<br/>\nOften, for teens, hives can be confused with mild acne, but her complexion<br/>\nhad changed suddenly and I noticed first and brought it to her attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter asked for me to get her some other facial cleanser, I did and<br/>\nher hives cleared.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, I think that it is easier to raise children with dignity and<br/>\nrespect and the freedom to make choices.  They get lots of practice making<br/>\ndecisions as they are growing and learning and by the time they are big<br/>\nenough to get into situations that could truly be dangerous, they actually<br/>\ncome to me for advice or make good decisions and then share with me.  Both<br/>\nof my kids are confident decision makers at the ripe old ages of 13 and 15,<br/>\nbecause they have been making decisions for a long time now.  Plus, now<br/>\nthey actually make my life as the householder easier because they<br/>\nparticipate in the running of the household.

Maybe, maybe not. Being overweight or obese is far more complex than eating too much sugar or fat. I was always overweight as a kid, and as an adult I am obese.  My brother and sister were always very thin as children, and now they are overweight too. We all ate basically the same diet. My parents didn&#39;t buy whatever we wanted, but they didn&#39;t place a lot of restrictions either. We could eat what was in the house and there tended to be a mix of fruit and vegetables along with soda and ice cream and chips, etc., sometimes more than others and usually dinner before dessert and that sort of thing.  Interestingly, I was the kid in the family who loved vegetables and would request them, yet I was always the most overweight.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as a parent my kids (6 and 2) are at weights appropriate for their heights and age if you want to go by the charts at the pediatricians office. They are not  thin children, but they are also young and my older child has thinned out a lot recently. He&#39;was a super chubby baby, and it was delightful. He grew to be 20lbs by 6 months on nothing but breastmilk. My daughter on the other hand grew to be 20lbs at one year. My son didn&#39;t even really eat solid foods until after he was a year, but my daughter started at 6 months and she definitely eats way more sweets than my son ever did at her age (mostly because she is exposed to them more, my son was less interested in food in general). Yet, she has always been thinner than he was at the same age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that to say that obesity is not based on diet alone. There are genetic factors, level of activity, body type, etc. Are your children overweight now? If not, why worry about a problem that may never develop? Also, it may be worth thinking about the idea that being skinny does not equal health either. I am obese but a few months ago I ran in my first 10k. I may be slow but by the end of the race I was passing other people who started out much faster than me. Am I healthier than them? I don&#39;t know really. But I know that I was able to run a 10k without stopping and that was pretty neat for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe if I hadnt been shamed for my weight so much as a child I would have tried to do more things, like running, that I thought I couldn&#39;t do because of my weight. Maybe if someone had told me that fat people can run and that being skinny doesn&#39;t automatically mean you can run faster or longer than others, maybe I would have tried it when I was younger. Maybe if I hadn&#39;t been shamed for my weight I wouldn&#39;t have felt like I had to hide myself or my food or I might have chosen more activities that I wanted to do but didn&#39;t because society told me I wasn&#39;t good enough because I was overweight. My mom also struggled with her weight and would share diet books with me and try to get me to do it with her. None of them ever helped her keep the weight off and I was horribly ashamed and hurt by it because it told me she thought there was something wrong or unacceptable about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think shame can play a huge factor in weight issues. I would be more concerned about the attitudes about weight I am showing my kids over worrying about their food choices and worrying that if they become obese it will be my fault. I know someone whose 3 year old makes remarks about McDonald&#39;s commercials, ewww, gross, why would anyone eat that, it is so bad! She was really proud of it. It made me cringe because I would be pretty embarrassed if my child said that in front of people who likely ate at McDonald&#39;s. Fine if she thinks fast food is horrible and bad for you and she won&#39;t let her kids eat it, but I think it is kind of messed up to so impress that on a 3 year old that she walks around shaming other people for their food choices. Of course I don&#39;t think this child is doing it in a mean spirited way, but that is what she has been taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266230379,"authorName":"Aisha Alkhani","from":"Aisha Alkhani &lt;alwaysaisha@...&gt;","profile":"alkhani_tribe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;sugar is poison&quot; on the news today","postDate":"1328764275","msgId":65446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRFJoMGU4SHYrV3NGUlNKeG9aQ09Sb209eWpXMlBhbmo0R0N1Ml9qcjFXS2l2eC1TZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpncHN2cCtldW44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpncHN2cCtldW44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65444,"nextInTopic":65447,"prevInTime":65445,"nextInTime":65447,"topicId":65416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello to everyone, I think that government stepping in to control sugar is really quite frankly sad and scary.  I can think of a lot worse things in our diets","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1994689538\">Hello to everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that government stepping in to control sugar is really quite<br/>\nfrankly sad and scary.  I can think of a lot worse things in our diets like<br/>\nGMOs or pesticides.  I could go on much further and I am sure the rest of<br/>\nyou would probably agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we lived in the middle east sugar was a staple in our diets.  It was<br/>\neven supplemented by the government.  Children usually went to school after<br/>\nhaving a large bowl of dried bread wetted down in heavily sugared tea.  On<br/>\nthe way to school children ate a bag of chips from the local market or<br/>\ncookies.  If you were rich you got a bottle of super sweet chocolate milk.<br/>\n For lunch mom probably threw a cucumber in your bag and a sandwich made of<br/>\nbread and a spice mix.  You came home for your one large meal of the day<br/>\nthat consisted of rice bread veggies and if your rich some piece of meat on<br/>\nthe table and maybe something like hummus.  Hardly anyone in Syria is fat.<br/>\n And we ate more sugar, more carbs, more fried foods than any American<br/>\nwould ever dream of.  Heck I dropped almost 100 pounds during the three<br/>\nyears I lived there.  I came back to America, tried to diet to drop a few<br/>\nmore pounds, and amazingly I have merely put on more weight.  I really<br/>\nbelieve it is due to all the process garbage we have here, the hormones the<br/>\ngmos etc.  I cant put my finger on anything else that could be the cause.<br/>\n It is really scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for denying my children and family sugar here, that would just be cruel<br/>\nin my humble opinion.  Lots of things in this life are dangerous and might<br/>\nin fact kill you.  Lets go for a walk in the woods, take a breath of that<br/>\ngreat city air, or go to the zoo, they all might very well kill you but it<br/>\ndoesnt keep us from doing it.  And it certainly shouldnt!  When my kids<br/>\ncrave sugar we start baking, and sometimes if there is no time for baking<br/>\nwe break out a jar of peanut butter!  My kids love to snack on chocolate<br/>\nchips too.  I have five skinny twiggy boys and I am honest when I tell you<br/>\nthey eat TONS of sugar and a whole lot of other stuff deemed bad for you.<br/>\n We sweeten their milk too.  I really cant find anything wrong with it.  :)<br/>\n I think it would be far more detrimental to deny them, than to give them.<br/>\n Childrens bodies really do know what they need, and I have always let my<br/>\nchildren have a say in what is planned for any meal in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just my two cents.  But I am beginning to ramble again.  Long story<br/>\nshort, long before the gov. concerns it self with sugar maybe it oughtta<br/>\nlook at companies like Monsanto or other Franken Food...<br/>\n<br/>\nAisha<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Feb 6, 2012 at 4:58 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shellythouse@...\">shellythouse@...</a> &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shellythouse@...\">shellythouse@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7383/full/482027a.html\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7383/full/482027a.html</a><br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t access this article but it is the basis for a number of news<br/>\n&gt; stories recently about sugar being poison and that it should be taxed and<br/>\n&gt; restricted like tobacco and alcohol are.<br/>\n&gt; We keep hearing about an obesity epidemic, about increasing prevalence of<br/>\n&gt; Type 2 diabetes in children.<br/>\n&gt; These are some of the thoughts (fears) in my mind as my daughter (3 years<br/>\n&gt; old) chooses to eat lots of sugar/candy which I make available to her.<br/>\n&gt; I guess what I&#39;m really wondering is- am I doing anything differently from<br/>\n&gt; parents who have overweight/obese children?

One of those theories is that we don&#39;t get enough exercise<br/>\nand are too stressed.  It isn&#39;t a one size fits all solution kind of<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These are some of the thoughts (fears) in my mind as my daughter (3 years<br/>\n&gt; old) chooses to eat lots of sugar/candy which I make available to her.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess what I&#39;m really wondering is- am I doing anything differently<br/>\n&gt; from parents who have overweight/obese children?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you shaming and trying to induce guilt?  I have seen many parents shame<br/>\ntheir chubby child in front of a crowd about what and how much they eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffer healthy food along with the sweets, fruit is sweet, carrots are<br/>\nsweet.  When my kids were little I kept containers of cut up fruit and<br/>\nveggies in a fridge drawer that my kids could get into easily.  I also had<br/>\na snack cabinet with dried fruit (sweet again), candy, chips, etc that they<br/>\ncould access.  The only &#39;rule&#39; was that we had to close the container so<br/>\nthat it wouldn&#39;t go stale, which meant I would check it regularly and close<br/>\nit.  Sometimes I would say, &quot;we are having   ______ for dinner in just a<br/>\nfew minutes, would you rather have that?&quot;  Sometimes they waited on the<br/>\nsnack and ate dinner, sometimes they ate the snack and dinner too,<br/>\nsometimes they ate just the snack.  Choices help children learn to choose<br/>\nwisely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess I&#39;m saying it would be the parents&#39; fault if their children<br/>\n&gt; are obese and develop health problems because of it.  Aren&#39;t those parents<br/>\n&gt; offering what their kids want to eat too?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The reasons for obesity are complex and varied.  Genetics, lifestyle (how<br/>\nmuch a person moves, etc) and what they eat and a host of other factors<br/>\naffect this.  We don&#39;t know what other parents are doing, but I have seen<br/>\nmany parents withhold food, both &#39;junk&#39; and  &#39;good&#39; food because it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe right time to eat or the parent told the child that they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nhungry.  I don&#39;t know how a person can know if another is hungry or not,<br/>\nexcept to believe them when they say that they are hungry.  It can become<br/>\nsuch a major power/control issue--access to food and the timing of such<br/>\naccess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I &#39;m sure it will help to continue with the variety of foods on the<br/>\n&gt; monkey platter (I couldn&#39;t believe how excited she was the first time I<br/>\n&gt; made one for her, such an easy suggestion to implement and it made her so<br/>\n&gt; happy). What else do I need to keep in mind?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would suggest keeping a variety on hand at all times, mix it up as much<br/>\nas possible.  I used to cut up a bunch of veggies and fruits and store them<br/>\nin the fridge for up to 3 days (if it lasted that long) and also keep lots<br/>\nof dried fruit, granola bars, little candy bars, nuts, finger sized snacks<br/>\nlike chips or pretzels, cookies, crackers, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried to shop smart and buy things that were tasty, but also made<br/>\nwith healthy stuff or made it myself.  I make a double or triple batch of<br/>\ncookie dough and wrap it up into wax paper logs to cut and bake at will.<br/>\nThese will keep in the freezer a long time.  There are recipes for crackers<br/>\ntoo that you can do the same with.  The other bonus is that home made is<br/>\nusually much cheaper and I think it tastes better.  Also, it is a really<br/>\nfun activity with the kids.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;sugar is poison&quot; on the news today","postDate":"1328716126","msgId":65437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR2VnBRUWhaRnJLb0NhN05hZDJzdi1QUVBHR0dQenFrUDUwQ1dUODBtQXB0Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3NEUzREI3LTFERjItNDVCOS05MTI4LUFENDdFMzJEQ0Q3MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpndGZmcCtjbW50QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Mzc0RTNEQjctMURGMi00NUI5LTkxMjgtQUQ0N0UzMkRDRDcwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65436,"nextInTopic":65439,"prevInTime":65436,"nextInTime":65438,"topicId":65416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

All of the basic stuff that makes any food<br/>\nis something we need for our health in some quantity. This includes sugar.<br/>\nI think that many children (and adults too) have developed an unhealthy<br/>\nrelationship to sweets because of being tightly controlled and kept away<br/>\nfrom sweets.  This is often compounded by messages that a certain food is<br/>\n&#39;evil&#39; and guilt about eating some food or another.  People are encouraged<br/>\nto eat for reasons other than hunger and that sets up all kinds of problems<br/>\nwith how and how much food is eaten.  I have always tried to encourage my<br/>\nchildren to follow their appetites.  Sometimes they grave proteins,<br/>\nsometimes fats, sometimes sweets.  Sometimes they actually crave mixed wild<br/>\ngreens with lots of other raw veggies.  The fact that neither is overweight<br/>\nand both have pretty balanced diets tells me that they are in a good place<br/>\nwith relating to food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk with them about nutrition and what research says. We have had some<br/>\nreally good conversations about how research can be biased.  I try to avoid<br/>\nany food that isn&#39;t nature built.  So I don&#39;t generally buy artificial<br/>\nsweeteners (sucralose, nutrasweet/aspartame, high fructose corn syrup),<br/>\nartificial fats or chemically altered (hydrogenated)  fats.  This is<br/>\nbecause of my own pet theory that our bodies are made to digest things that<br/>\nexisted before we started making fundamental changes to the chemical<br/>\nstructure of food.  I tell my children about this decision and how I could<br/>\nbe wrong, but it feels right to not eat something built in a factory or<br/>\nlab.  They agree with me for the most part, even though sometimes we eat<br/>\nstuff that isn&#39;t &quot;born on a farm or in a field&quot;.  Of course, the<br/>\nhydrogenated fats and corn syrup are the hardest to avoid and we really<br/>\ndon&#39;t, except when we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have had all of the above, but interestingly, they don&#39;t like the<br/>\nstuff much.  The artificial sweeteners give my daughter headaches and my<br/>\nson just doesn&#39;t like the taste of fake sweetener.  They prefer products<br/>\nmade with cane sugar instead of corn syrup.  I don&#39;t notice a big<br/>\ndifference, but they tell me that they do, maybe because they have younger,<br/>\nfresher taste buds....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also try to avoid artificial colors because my son had reactions to<br/>\nyellow 5 when he was younger.  He says it still bothers him, but not<br/>\nhorribly so.  We have had major (anaphylaxis) allergies in many members of<br/>\nour family, so we are trying to avoid going there.  Not that we never have<br/>\nanything with food coloring, but we all taste the food coloring in really<br/>\nbrightly colored foods. I stopped eating most hard candies because of the<br/>\naftertaste.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur grocery list is a family project every other week.  I keep the list and<br/>\nask everyone what they want on it.  My kids always go with me to shop and<br/>\nthey help decide what we buy, what meals we cook, what junk we buy.  My 15<br/>\nyo and 13 yo have a better grasp of how to make a grocery list (after<br/>\nplanning meals), shop for it as frugally as possible, and bring it all home<br/>\nand make use of the groceries than my husband does.  This is all because<br/>\nthey have always gone with me to the grocery store.  I almost always say<br/>\n&#39;yes&#39; to &quot; Mom, can we get some______?&quot;  Sometimes I might say, &quot;let&#39;s put<br/>\nit in the cart and see if we can afford it in the budget after we have<br/>\ngotten all the stuff that we need&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there is a decision making process around what we want more.  It<br/>\nisn&#39;t a matter of deprivation or control, but financial realities can&#39;t be<br/>\nignored.  We have a budget and a running shopping list.  Some things have<br/>\nbeen on the list for months (e.g. I want to get new towels, but we don&#39;t<br/>\nneed them) but they are on the &#39;nice to have&#39; part of the list, not the &#39;we<br/>\nneed&#39; side.  My kids are part of the team that keeps track of the grocery<br/>\nsituation.  Mostly because, as teens, they do most of the eating.  :)  So<br/>\nthey know when stuff is low or out before I do.  We are lucky in that there<br/>\nis very little that we can&#39;t get and we always have enough food.  We have<br/>\nsome friends that are in very tight financial circumstances and when the<br/>\nyoungster comes over to play, he is always actually hungry and loves that<br/>\nhe can have fruit at our house.  We always make sure to have snacks (both<br/>\nhealthy and not quite as healthy) to offer.  He will often have meals with<br/>\nus as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were younger, they would sometimes go through a phase of<br/>\ncraving some food that was really not very healthy.  I dealt with this by<br/>\ngiving them as much of it as they wanted any time they wanted it.  This<br/>\nseems to short circuit the possibility that they develop some weird<br/>\nrelationship with a food.  We would have a big bucket of double bubble gum<br/>\nin the house all of the time.  I learned to keep some sort of chips in the<br/>\nhouse, even though I never bought them before (I am not a chip person).  I<br/>\ntry to make baked sweets (due to budget and health-home made is usually<br/>\nmore healthful, less artificial food), it isn&#39;t really that much work to<br/>\nmake some cup cakes or a banana bread and we always have some sort of<br/>\nchocolate in the house.  I decided to do this before I had ever heard of<br/>\nradical unschooling, because this is how my mother raised me and I saw that<br/>\nchildren who were tightly controlled in what they ate or had the chance to<br/>\neat would gorge on the &#39;taboo&#39; foods any chance they got.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is out of the house most and hates shopping, so he is not really<br/>\ninvolved with groceries, except to eat... My mother in law often relates<br/>\nhorror stories of my husband having tantrums at stores as a child, maybe<br/>\nthere is a connection with his hating shopping?  He is also the only one<br/>\nwho will eat a lot of unhealthy food without even realizing that he has<br/>\ndone so, and my mother in law was a sweets hider/controller.  She would<br/>\nhide the candy and sweets and my husband and his brother made it a game to<br/>\nfind and eat them.

Sadly those who designed the study concluded that parents<br/>\n&gt; still HAD TO control their kids&#39; diets even if it resulted in the kids<br/>\n&gt; having skewed relationships with food.

It wasn&#39;t thought of as anything bad at all...it was<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I think most obesity these days is because of overall calorie<br/>\nconsumption being much higher than in the past. Rosie is taking a nutrition<br/>\nclass and I read in her textbook that calorie consumption is 800 calories<br/>\nper day per person higher on average today than in 1958 and 500 calories<br/>\nhigher than in 1970 - that&#39;s almost a 25% increase in the last 40 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe increased calories from 1970 to today are from increased consumption of<br/>\nrefined grains (about 10 percent of the increase in calories is due to<br/>\nthis); added fats and oils (added to other foods) (9%); added sugars (4 to<br/>\n7%); fruits and vegetables combined (1.5%); meat and nuts combined (1%);<br/>\nand dairy including eggs (-1.5%).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, diets have improved in other ways in the past 20 years...leaner<br/>\nmeats, more fruits and veggies, healthier oils.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn comparison to the 1950s, meat consumption is 57 pounds per person higher<br/>\nnow. Cheese consumption is about 4 times higher from 7.7 pounds per person<br/>\nto 29.8 pounds per person. About half the cheese is in commercially<br/>\nprepared fast food, restaurant, or convenience foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a lengthy chapter about the US dietary history, so I won&#39;t bore you<br/>\nwith more, but it is interesting that it says absolutely nothing about<br/>\npeople being obese due to eating more candy or other sweets.

She&#39;d say, &quot;Eat an apple,&quot; but the cold crisp apples hurt my<br/>\nteeth/gums when I&#39;d bit into one. She&#39;d have hard boiled eggs for us to<br/>\neat, but they had to be peeled. So I&#39;d grab some cookies. That was quick,<br/>\ntasty, and provided me with the quick energy I was needing.

And they&#39;re busy people! They&#39;re naturally drawn to energy in concentrated form.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving easy access to a variety is key. That way they can discover what satisfies the signals they&#39;re getting from their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults assume their disdain for foods like Cap&#39;n Crunch and Twinkies is because their palates are more sophisticated, that they&#39;ve learned what foods taste good.

Families are immersed in a stressful society that -- as suggested by the Rat Park studies -- is a fertile environment for addictive behavior. They are given advice that adds to the stress. And then are being judged as at fault because their kids are obese which adds even more stress which radiates to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Aren&#39;t those parents<br/>\n&gt; offering what their kids want to eat too?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The overwhelming mainstream parenting message is about controlling kids&#39; food.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a way to peer into what&#39;s happening in mainstream homes. All you see are the results and the messages that are going in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany unschoolers on the list open up their homes through what they write to let you see the inner workings.

You can see their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What else do I need to keep in mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That happiness, peace, freedom from added stress, choice, support, acceptance, trust, compassion are the best nutrition for health. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;sugar is poison&quot; on the news today","postDate":"1328587889","msgId":65420,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjg1ODc4ODkuNTg3MDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpncHN2cCtldW44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpncHN2cCtldW44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65419,"nextInTopic":65422,"prevInTime":65419,"nextInTime":65421,"topicId":65416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Aren t those parents offering what their kids want to eat too?  -=-=-=-=-=- I know a couple of chubby kids within a group of local  homeschoolers and Cub","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1890264890\"> Aren&#39;t those parents offering what their kids want to eat too? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a couple of chubby kids within a group of local  homeschoolers and Cub Scouts that we hang out with.<br/>\nThose two boys have their food controlled and candy/sugar/snacks limited.<br/>\nOne I know was on a diet when he was about 7 !<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are definitely not eating what they want.
