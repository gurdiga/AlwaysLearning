I was trying to use unschooling to save the world. That&#39;s not what it&#39;s for.&nbsp;<br><br>It did not help my nieces and nephews that I believed they were being damaged by school.

My pity was condescending.&nbsp;<br><br>People in this group helped me to shift my perspective.<br><br>What helped was for me to build relationships with these kids within the space that I was given. What helped was to get close, watch them, see who they were and where they were at, and then to let that all of that be ok with me, and to just be their champion.&nbsp;What helped was for me to focus on unschooling well in my OWN home, so that unschooling could (mostly!) speak for itself because our peace, connection, and engagement with the world was contagious. <br><br>It was a difficult reality to accept, but when I let go of the imaginary &quot;unschooling world&quot; I was able to let go of the idea of saving these kids, and my fear that they were being damaged. Once I was able to accept the kids as they were, I was able to give them as much unschooling love as would fit in the time and space I had with them. I was also able to stop doing them harm by wishing or insisting that things be different for them.&nbsp;<br><br>One of my siblings began unschooling her 3 kids this year. I don&#39;t think she would have done so without my example. I also don&#39;t think she *could* have done so, had I not stopped myself from arguing about the damage school was doing to them. It helped for me to encourage her, by shedding light on what our parenting styles had in common.&nbsp;<br><br>*********************<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolworld\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolworld</a><br><b style=\"font-family:Times;font-size:medium;\">Unschoolers live in the same world as other people.</b><span style=\"font-family:Times;font-size:medium;\">&nbsp;If you plan ahead, you can live in that world even better than most people do.

That way of seeing has to do with spatial reasoning.  There is a set of intelligences that go together and part of that is what schools began, after a while, to call “dyslexia.”   It means “can’t read.”<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t use the word if you don’t have to use it.  It’s a fancy scientific/medical-sounding term for bad-at-words.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYES, pressing early reading can cause a child to dread and avoid reading, so in that broader definition they can create dyslexia.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the description of people reversing letters and getting mixed up about which direction to read has to do with the relative position of something, from “the middle”—the midline of a person’s vision, or mapping (seeing what’s out in front).  The coolest and most common example of this is little kids learning to write their names.  If the first letter is backwards, the child might (if left alone) write the whole word in a mirror-image way.  What they know is what the next letter, and next, look like next to the letter before.  Kids grow out of that as they learn left-to-right.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other cultures where words are written top to bottom, or right to left, there are probably other examples (though top down is less confusing to human eyes and brains than right-to-left is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt happens that there is a skill in seeing things in a three-dimensional way, and in being able to reverse and rotate objects mentally.  Engineering comes of that.  And most people called dyslexic are boys.  And many people whose strongest intelligence is mathematical and spatial reasoning are boys, and those can come as a set.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to look for other sets of intelligences.  I’ll take that to another topic, but dyslexia isn’t created so much as it is a natural part of seeing for MANY, many people.  Mostly male.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately for male children in school, many boys are maturing more slowly than girls (as to brain development) so the girls (statistically, not all, every one) learn to read more easily, sooner.  So some boys are called dyslexic because they’ve been frustrated and learned to fear reading lessons.  Some have that math/engineering/dyslexia combination.  They can be very productive  humans if they’re not crushed and defeated in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- teaching / forcing children to learn to read too young-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNO one can force a child to learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll they can do is talk, test, press, shame, and MAYBE that child will happen to learn to read in spite of all that, or maybe that child will learn never to want to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking that reading can be taught or forced “too young” is not clear thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] School vs. unschooling","postDate":"1549225944","msgId":78534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4QjI5RTI3LUI4QzctNDNDMi1BNUY3LTlBODI2NjEzQjdCOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3MzUwRTJELTUyODItNDI2Qy05RjM0LUFGRTRGNjM3ODI0MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDY3MzUwRTJELTUyODItNDI2Qy05RjM0LUFGRTRGNjM3ODI0MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78533,"nextInTopic":78535,"prevInTime":78533,"nextInTime":78535,"topicId":78533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Before even looking at this I want to say two things: Some people only “get permission” to unschool because their child has something wrong, some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191597727\">Before even looking at this I want to say two things:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people only “get permission” to unschool because their child has something wrong, some difference, some diagnosis.  THEN, and only then, will the spouse or other parent or grandparents relax and support unschooling.  That is a disadvantage to that parent and child.   If there is anyone reading who began that way, I hope you will be able to move away from it gently and quietly and live as though that’s not the way thing started.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is that schools, increasingly, want to label kids.  They get funding because of it.  They get to adjust their test scores (by not including the scores of some of the kids) which improves their ranking in the district and state.   They might get more classrooms or teachers, if they can identify enough of the right thing (whatever is in vogue in those days in that district) to justify hiring another special ed teacher.    All of that competition between schools, and the desire for the teachers and administrators to have a reason NOT to expect a child to test well (so it’s not their fault, because that child has a disability or condition)…. all of that is some of the worst part of school politics and reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not bring that home.

So I will parcel it out into topics, and those new to unschooling, new to the group, should not share fears or schoolishness.   Fearful schoolishness hasn’t ever helped unschooling yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My situation is that I&#39;ve recently started teaching in an alternative sort of school where I have freedom to teach as I want. It&#39;s not fully unschooling but I will make it as close as I can within what&#39;s possible. I&#39;m getting some kids who I feel have been damaged by their time in mainstream schools in New Zealand where the teaching of reading starts at 5. With the previous government they were labeled as below/ behind etc if they weren&#39;t reading by 6. I know - horrible.”<br/>\n<br/>\nFor teaching as you want, forget unschooling entirely.  It cannot be done a few hours a day, away from home.  People whose kids are in school expect for them to be taught, and expect to “see progress.”  To overlay that onto unschooling, or to overlay unschooling on that, won’t help either one at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at other teaching methods might help, but that’s not the purpose or topic of this group.  <br/>\nOpen classroom, look-say, whatever might be out there, about learning to read, over the past several decades, would be better to look for than unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools are divided into years.  Even in a classroom that combines different ages, there are comparisons that cannot be prevented, and a child being left to learn to read at his own pace and in his own way without pressure can’t happen if he moves from being one of the youngest, and then there’s another year, and another, and another, and he’s becoming one of the oldest and still can’t read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, pressure harms reading.  It adds confusion, and fear.   Embarrassment and shame cause aversion and resentment.   If the sight of words, or the clock showing “reading time” makes a child apprehensive or stressed, he can’t spend that time learning to read, but will more likely spend it trying just to feel safe and okay.  Eventually, he might shut down and not even try.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s where lifelong non-readers come from, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/maslow\">http://sandradodd.com/maslow</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many unschooling parents who have taught in schools.  The first year I taught, I was given the five lowest-scoring classes (125 kids whose reading was the worst) and told it was a reading class.  I wasn’t trained in it, I did my best in fun ways to help them like books, but I saw scars and callouses in their emotions and logic and willingness and abilities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that year I had mixed-groups, teaching English (language arts) and that was much better, when reading ability wasn’t a dividing factor, and they could learn things less stressfully, in various ways.  Getting information into them, and an appreciation of words, and exposure to stories they’re not able to read on their own, and acknowledging other ways of story telling and information sharing than reading itself can help with writing, eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/writing\">http://sandradodd.com/writing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78547,"nextTopicId":25624}}
