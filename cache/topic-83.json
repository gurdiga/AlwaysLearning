There can&#39;t be an<br/>\naverage without some people at the extremes, and some<br/>\nare naturally at the extremes from genetics, <br/>\nand they are at their OWN &quot;normal&quot; (midrange for their<br/>\nown body&#39;s development, as their body has no idea<br/>\nabout other organisms of the same age).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing by &quot;underweight&quot; maybe the writer meant<br/>\nunhealthily scrawny or dangerously thin.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly seems scrawny to me.  She always has.  But she&#39;s<br/>\nstrong and active and so I just don&#39;t worry about her<br/>\nbones showing.  I&#39;m sure it will pass <br/>\nsooner than she&#39;d like it to (given the prevailing<br/>\nprejudices in the land in which she lives).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely agree with this. Tamzin has always been<br/>\n&#39;scrawny&#39;, since birth. When she was a baby the doc<br/>\ntried to tell me she was underweight and to give her<br/>\nsome formula along with breastmilk. That was the last<br/>\ntime we saw that doc! She has always been tall and<br/>\nthin and I know that it&#39;s just her physical makeup.<br/>\nShe&#39;s healthy, active and almost never gets ill. She<br/>\nalso is one of those kids who hardly eats (although<br/>\nshe is eating more as she gets older). Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen a worry (usually when I start listening to other<br/>\npeople&#39;s concerns about her eating habits &lt;g&gt;), but<br/>\nmostly I remember why it is that I chose the whole<br/>\nunschooling lifestyle in the first place - I trust my<br/>\ndd to know what she needs (physically as well as<br/>\nmentally).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
