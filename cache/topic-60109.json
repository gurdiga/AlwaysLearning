She sleeps in a twin bed next to our king family bed. I am up often <br/>\nthroughout the night nursing and comforting my 15mo twins, so I am aware of <br/>\nRowan&#39;s sleep rhythms.  She goes to sleep between 7 and 9pm with her brothers <br/>\nand me, then sleeps very soundly (no movement or slight shifting) for about 5-6 <br/>\nhours.  At that time, she often becomes &quot;restless&quot; and kicks her covers off, <br/>\nmoans and groans, talks a bit, and some times wakes to go to the potty or asks <br/>\nfor a drink.  After this brief interlude (no more than 10 minutes or so), she is <br/>\nback to sleep, again quite soundly, for another 5-6 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article also mentioned that the city ambient light often wakes people up or <br/>\nkeeps them up later in the evening/night. We do not have this issue in our home <br/>\n(except for my husband, who works until 11 or 1am and then &quot;unwinds&quot; until some <br/>\ntimes 2 or 3am).  The youngest two fall asleep in the rocking chair between 6 <br/>\nand 8pm, and Rowan and I are off to bed with them within an hour of that.  Our <br/>\nbedroom is purposefully dark, cool (to get and keep us under the covers), free <br/>\nfrom toys (with the exception of a few stuffies for Rowan), books, and media, <br/>\nwhite-noise filled, and loaded with covers, pillows, and mattresses for comfort. <br/>\nI have found that this really does aid in putting to sleep and keeping asleep <br/>\neveryone in our family pretty well.  This atmosphere also keeps my husband <br/>\nasleep into the morning hours, so that he gets the sleep he needs, but it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t keep my kids or me from waking up with the daylight.  Of course, as <br/>\neveryone gets older and more independent, this will likely change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Lisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: an interesting article on sleep","postDate":"1299076042","msgId":60127,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4MThGMzBBLUFGRTYtNENEMS1CNDhFLTlBQUJEQjBENjc1NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrbGlxMCtpa2FwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlrbGlxMCtpa2FwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60126,"nextInTopic":60128,"prevInTime":60126,"nextInTime":60128,"topicId":60109,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=------I m curious if anyone s kids, those beyond napping age, wake up like this partway through their sleep?------=- Kirby did, when he was young.

Noor&#39;s waking in the middle of the night as a baby was our first clue that &#39;conventional parenting&#39; practices were painful/stifling for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was learning to pour, she would wake up in the middle of the night and want to go downstairs, to our water jug, where she&#39;d sit for an hour pouring water from the jug into cups.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was learning to crawl, she&#39;d wake up in the middle of the night to practice crawling.  The same thing happened with walking and talking, as well as other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften, she&#39;d want a snack as well.  She was constantly moving as a younger baby/child, and never nursed/ate much while she was awake, so midnight snacks were a huge part of her diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften, the things she was practicing at night, weren&#39;t things she would do during the day.  She crawled/walked at night before she did it during the day!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as we quickly learned, trying to make her go back to sleep before she was done was impossible.  She would cry or scream or cry and scream for that &quot;window&quot; of time, unless she was doing whatever it was she needed to do. There was nothing we could have done to make her go back to sleep!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Noor is 7.5yr, she still wakes up in the middle of the night.  Most often, she gets up to draw something she dreamed about or because she remembers something she forgot to add to a drawing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe drawings she does in the middle of the night have a very different quality than the ones she does in the daytime.  All her work is stunning, but the midnight ones are even more so.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is never fully awake in the same way she is during the day.

At the blog she cited, I found an article with various sorts of evidence (including linguistic--my fave) that it has long been natural human behavior to wake up halfway through an eight-hour sleep.   GOOD!  I wake up about 3:20 every night, and have felt wrong, ashamed, that something wasn&#39;t right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/biphasic-sleep/\">http://www.marksdailyapple.com/biphasic-sleep/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow I can feel much better about that waking up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comments are fun, too.  I left one with a link to my sleep page.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a mention in there of 30% of... [people?  those in treatment for...?] people are insomniac.   But if they sleep four hours and wake up (especially if it&#39;s 30% or more--if that number was people reporting or being treated or &quot;identified insomniac&quot; :-) ), maybe it&#39;s NORMAL!!  Healthy. Right and good.   Then they sleep another four hours, after a little break (to pee, or think, or get a snack).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe note I left is:<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the sentinal theory. I�ve often thought that teenagers� propensity to stay up late might have been very useful in �the old days� (caves, camps or castles) because they could keep watch while they talked to each other. And their sleeping in the daytime while others are awake is seen as sloth in modern days by too many people, but I think as long as they get sleep, it shouldn�t matter so much what time it is. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleep\">http://sandradodd.com/sleep</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI misspelled sentinel.
