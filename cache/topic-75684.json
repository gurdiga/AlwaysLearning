We have two daughters-12 and 9 yrs. I find that I increasingly am getting less tolerant and more angry when they choose to watch movies at home. I willingly say yes to the first 2 movies. By the third, I can feel my anger rising and by the fourth, I&#39;ve usually erupted. I realise that my reaction hampers their freedom to choose and even makes them anxious, but I am unable to wrap my mind around the reality of almost 8 hrs a day spent watching movies. The other guilt I go through is that I have so far been unable to bring myself to watching movies with them for so many hours, I feel responsible and like a failure because other kind of activities with them are not happening. I also struggle to truly deeply believe that its ok to watch so many movies. Or does it become an ok thing if I am watching with them? I want &quot;Being&quot; and &quot;parenting peacefully&quot; but its not happening.</span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75664,"nextTopicId":75685}}
