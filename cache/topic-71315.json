Next weekend (starting this Thursday) a couple of dozen families are meeting in Minneapolis at a water park:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com\">http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s too late to get discount rooms, but the rooms aren&#39;t very much anyway and they come with four waterpark passes.   Speakers are Jill Parmer, Alex Polikowsky and me, and there will be guided discussions based on a model I used for years in philosophy discussions within the SCA.  I haven&#39;t done these at conferences before, but Rippy Dusseldorp and I talked about it last summer, and I&#39;ve been thinking about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis summer, Joyce Fetteroll and I will speak in four places.  Three are Always Learning events, and one is the LiTTLe Conference, run by Julie Daniel near London.  Lisbon, London, Leiden (and Selkirk) is what I&#39;ve been calling the little circuit, although the order is this:<br/>\nLisbon, Portugal June 1-2, 2013<br/>\nSelkirk (Scotland) UK  June  24 (a Monday)<br/>\nLeiden, the Netherlands, June 29<br/>\nAshford, Surrey, UK  July 13-14<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/europe-2013.html\">http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/europe-2013.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn December I&#39;ll do another event here in Albuquerque between Christmas and New Year&#39;s but I don&#39;t have a site up for it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2014 there is a possibility and some definites:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce and Sandra to Australia in March and early April for five gatherings, the last one of which will include Schuyler Waynforth and her husband, David.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/australia-2014.html\">http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/australia-2014.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe California (still talking)<br/>\n<br/>\nLate September, Maine and New Hampshire (still being sorted out, but a definite plan):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/maine-septemberoctober-2014.html\">http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/p/maine-septemberoctober-2014.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose interested in Minneapolis should do something soon. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose interested in the others can put it on the calendar and start saving money!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71304,"nextTopicId":71316}}
