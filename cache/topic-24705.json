Before unschooling, when Brenna was maybe 10,  we <br/>\nwere using an Oak Meadow curriculum and they must be from that time.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I asked both kids what they knew about these women.  Logan  (12) knew that <br/>\nAmelia Earhart was a pilot who they think was lost at sea in the  Bermuda <br/>\nTriangle.  He thought he&#39;d seen a reference to it on Family Guy or  maybe some <br/>\nother TV show.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBrenna remembers Amelia Earhart having a gap between her teeth and  people <br/>\nteaching her to smile without showing it.  She knew general  information about <br/>\nher also but that is what sticks out in her mind.<br/>\n <br/>\n She knew Harriet Tubman was involved in the underground railroad but  what <br/>\nshe remembers most about her was that she had narcolepsy from being hit in  the <br/>\nhead by a brick which caused her to fall asleep during meetings.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe said that she knew both of those things from sources other than the  <br/>\nbooks I made her read when she was 10!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: RE: [AlwaysLearning] harriet tubman","postDate":"1142274159","msgId":24716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0ZGY0NjIxNGRmN2QxLjE0ZGY3ZDExNGRmNDYyQGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24709,"nextInTopic":24720,"prevInTime":24715,"nextInTime":24717,"topicId":24705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dd learned about Harriet Tubman by watching Sister, Sister on tv.
