Budist<br/>\nmonge &quot;robbed&quot; (copied Budda&#39;s teaching and snicked into Japan).<br/>\nToday many Japanese ideograms are different fm the Chinese ones<br/>\nbecause the &quot;revolution&quot; have simplyfied the ideograms there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the brushes, I would suggest going to bookstores/or any<br/>\nJapanese school and buying the brush-caligraph-kit for school<br/>\nchildren.  Chinese/Japanese goods shops also might have them.  At<br/>\nleast in San Jose, San Francisco, CA, I have seen them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know much about Chinese ideograms.  I would suggest<br/>\nposting to our HP <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org\">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a> .  There<br/>\nare some members that are bilingual English/Chinese and they<br/>\nmight have more clues.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb, I am glad for Dylan!  What a boy and what a family!  Someday<br/>\nour children might meet and then...will they speak in English or<br/>\nin Japanese?  Portuguese, who knows!<br/>\n.............<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weekend we spent with Tokyo Homeschoolers Network (one<br/>\nJapanese unschoolers group).  It was an overnight event so that<br/>\nfamilies could share experiences.  As weekday socialization do<br/>\nnot normally happen here in Japan (most houses are too small to<br/>\nhave visitors, life here is relied heavily on train<br/>\ntransportation that usually run fm 5 AM to 0.30AM, long working<br/>\nhours...etc), our family had, for the first time, the opportunity<br/>\nto meet others unschooling families. 17 people ranging fm 2 1/2<br/>\nyo to 66 yo were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the disvantage of hs in Tokyo is that any place we want to<br/>\ngo, we have to take trains.  It is good that we don&#39;t have to pay<br/>\nfor the maintenace of a car, which is costly here, but for any<br/>\noutings, events even to reach another unschooler&#39;s family take us<br/>\nat least an hour (that not counting the time to change clothes,<br/>\nto walk to the station, wait for the train...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere it was said that most of the Japanese hs are unschoolers by<br/>\nits natural course.  The families go for the hs option because<br/>\nthey could make the child stay at the ps. And as the children are<br/>\nfed up with  schooling, there is no other option than<br/>\nde-schooling, then unschooling are found that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I was saying that since I began hs dd 3 years ago, I have<br/>\nbeen looking for hs in Brazil and that I found none. One of the<br/>\nmembers said; &quot;hs is an alternative for too much schooling. South<br/>\nHemisphere children are not yet praged by it.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7201,"nextTopicId":7189}}
