It&#39;s an account of how Sesame  <br/>\nStreet changed a boy&#39;s life, from the perspective of the grown man as  <br/>\na father.  Maybe this would be good to give to relatives who complain  <br/>\nabout television, because it has absolutely nothing to do with  <br/>\nunschooling, but all to do with learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted about my love for Sesame Street previously, but I can say  <br/>\nwithout a moment’s worth of doubt that Sesame Street was the most  <br/>\npositive influence on my life of anything that I experienced as a  <br/>\nchild. I grew up in a small town in southwest Missouri that was pretty  <br/>\nmuch the exact opposite of the Sesame Street world. Every family was  <br/>\nwhite. Education was minimal. To provide perspective: This was a town  <br/>\nwhere the KKK could march through the streets openly and be cheered;  <br/>\nit was a town where everyone attended church at least twice each week,  <br/>\nyet somehow it had the highest teen pregnancy rate in the state and  <br/>\nlater became a huge center for meth production. I know there are tons  <br/>\nof places just like this place and even much worse, but for me  <br/>\npersonally it’s still the most depressing place I can imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people don’t escape this place. My brother got hooked on meth and  <br/>\nhas never been the same since. My guess is that my sister was his  <br/>\ndealer. This is a normal story from that town. Even most of those kids  <br/>\nthere who didn’t have their lives ruined by drugs and alcohol grew up  <br/>\nin an environment where they were taught that different was bad,  <br/>\nintolerance was just fine, and racism was a given. Even now, with the  <br/>\nadvent of the Internet and satellite television, the outside world has  <br/>\nmade little dent in changing these attitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I got lucky. I had Sesame Street. PBS only came in with a lot of  <br/>\nfuzz on our TV, but I don’t remember a single day before I started  <br/>\nschool that I didn’t watch Sesame Street at least twice a day. And  <br/>\neven after I started school, I watched it regularly until junior high  <br/>\nand often enough even later. Yes, it was a kid’s show, but to me it  <br/>\nwas a lifeline. Sesame Street (and other shows such as The Electric  <br/>\nCompany) was the only time I saw kids who weren’t all white. The  <br/>\nmessages that it included of cultural curiosity and tolerance toward  <br/>\nothers’ views were messages I didn’t get from anywhere else. And so I  <br/>\ngrew up questioning the racism I saw around me. I don’t know if it was  <br/>\na gradual realization or not. But I do know it was different from what  <br/>\nmost of my peers saw for themselves. I know that my grandmother didn’t  <br/>\nspeak to me for two years after I (as a 7-year-old) got mad at her for  <br/>\nsaying something racist. I know that I had my car tires slashed more  <br/>\ntimes than I can count while I was in high school and that my senior  <br/>\nyearbook contains anonymous “signatures” consisting of death threats  <br/>\nbecause of my non-racist attitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd later I escaped. Unlike most of my classmates, I was able to get  <br/>\ninto college. I took off and have only been back to the town a handful  <br/>\nof times even though most of my family still lives there. A few of  <br/>\nthose times have been with my wife, whom I met several years later.  <br/>\nAfter our first visit, she was amazed at what she saw, but her first  <br/>\nquestion after we hopped in the car was, “How did you turn out so  <br/>\ndifferent?” I hadn’t really thought about my situation in that way  <br/>\nbefore, but my answer was simple: “Sesame Street.” I have no doubt  <br/>\nthat, without that one outside presence in my pre-school life, I would  <br/>\nnever have thought to question anything going on in my town until it  <br/>\nwould have been much too late to pull myself away. I don’t think I’m  <br/>\noverstating things when I say that Sesame Street saved my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears later, I had a son of my own and of course he was going to watch  <br/>\nSesame Street as often as I could get him in front of the TV. And,  <br/>\nyes, he liked it, even if it was now a different show with Elmo and  <br/>\nthe like. But unlike me, he didn’t love Sesame Street. He enjoyed it  <br/>\nand he watched it, but by the time he was five he lost interest in the  <br/>\nshow. It made me sad at first, but then I realized that he was now in  <br/>\na place where he didn’t “need” Sesame Street. His classroom has  <br/>\nchildren of several different races and backgrounds. He hears about  <br/>\nthe outside world every day. And that makes me happy. But there are  <br/>\nother kids out there who still need this show in the same way that I  <br/>\ndid, and I hope that Sesame Street is always there to help them as it  <br/>\ndid me.<br/>\nposted by zeugitai_guy at 8:48 AM on November 4<br/>\n<br/>\n==================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s where it resides:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/86370/Happy-Birthday-Big-Bird#2808752\">http://www.metafilter.com/86370/Happy-Birthday-Big-Bird#2808752</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you look at  google (at least in the U.S.) today there&#39;s a 40th  <br/>\nanniversary bit, in the title.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/\">http://www.google.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was little we had the Sesame Street 20th anniversary poster  <br/>\nup in his room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48387,"nextTopicId":48400}}
