It&#39;s something I wish I could take away from their knowledge.  In the age of DaVinci, math, art, and science were all studied together.  Throughout history, knowledge and learning have been lumped together in many different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go way back to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, the people who have been attributed with starting the basis of western philosophy, you see that they all studied everything, each with their own personal reflection on the world, writing and discussing things that were more relevant to each of them as individuals.  It wasn&#39;t until modern, post Renaissance thinking, that educational theories and thoughts started narrowly defining the world and breaking them up into mini subjects.  (correct me if I&#39;m wrong here, anyone who may know more about this than I do)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hear the phrase Renaissance Man, what does that imply?  Simply a very wide breadth of knowledge, in modern terminology, one who has studied and excelled in many subjects.  But, I don&#39;t think scholars of the Renaissance were breaking everything down into &quot;subjects&quot; like what we do today in modern schools, and even then, not everyone was actually in an academy, DaVinci is a prime example.  Learning was an all encompassing thing.  The Renaissance was hugely influenced by Greek scholars, which doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least.  Even so, there were even more people using skilled labor and thinking and passing on their skills to the next generation, who weren&#39;t scholars.  If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that DaVinci was so very important because he directly impacted skilled labor.  From the middle ages until somewhere about the mid 1800&#39;s, coinciding with compulsory schooling, most young people learned through apprenticeships, or through skills<br/>\n passed on from their own families&#39; trades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my very brief summary of how I think about &quot;subjects&quot; and education and why I don&#39;t like everything broken down into neat little packages called &quot;subjects&quot;.  I think it inhibits real thought and real learning.  Not to even get into the fact that scholars were adults, not children ages 6-16, and young people, roughly ages 13-16, were already working and in apprenticeships.  While I have no doubt that many children worked, they were still children.  I know I&#39;m hugely oversimplifying here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Necessary&quot; Subjects","postDate":"1255793731","msgId":48029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1NDVCMjRDLUE5Q0QtNDkxNy04M0RFLTBGN0Y4RDlDOThCRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhiY20zYStvbnRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhiY20zYStvbnRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48028,"nextInTopic":48030,"prevInTime":48028,"nextInTime":48030,"topicId":48022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- So for the last couple months I ve been thinking to myself when I see that argument, well, yeah, they are necessary subjects, but ...-=- Really?

I&#39;m new(ish) here and not really unschooling, as my son is only 9 months old, but I&#39;ve been learning so much from following this group and from Sandra&#39;s site. I&#39;m so grateful that I&#39;ve found unschooling while my son is so young.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking lately about all the arguments against unschooling (and homeschooling in general) that I see and hear in various places, such as the assertion that &quot;everyone NEEDS to learn algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics, etc., and that no mom can teach those subjects as well as a certified, trained, professional teacher, blah, blah, blah.&quot; So for the last couple months I&#39;ve been thinking to myself when I see that argument, &quot;well, yeah, they are necessary subjects, but unschoolers can learn those things on their own, or from a tutor or mentor, or a college class.&quot; But I&#39;ve gradually come to feel that they really aren&#39;t necessary for everyone (or even most people), since not everyone has a need for calculus or chemistry every day. I never took chemistry, and aside from losing a couple bets with my husband, it hasn&#39;t impaired my life at all. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like there are so many other subjects that are far more USEFUL in life, but that aren&#39;t offered in K-12 schools at all. Relevant, helpful, important information. Just off the top of my head, here are subjects that are more interesting and relevant to my life than calculus, chemistry, et al.: politics, philosophy, comparative religion, home maintenance, architecture, ecology, weather systems, sources of energy, war, journalism, gardening/farming, nutrition, electrical engineering, statistics, health and the healthcare industry, law, ethics, computer programming, web development, business organization, and so on. John Taylor Gatto mentions dialectics as an important subject no one teaches anymore, and I don&#39;t even know what that word means!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ve finally gotten over the notion that there are certain &quot;subjects&quot; everyone needs to learn between ages 6 and 16. Now I just need to get over being pissed off about wasting so much time in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me... what are your answers when people question you about these &quot;necessary&quot; subjects? It took me months, with a LOT of learning and reflecting, to get over my hangups just about this topic - how do you talk about this kind of thing with a highly skeptical questioner (say, a family member who you have to see all the time) when they have no interest in an actual conversation, let alone to have their entire worldview challenged?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47993,"nextTopicId":48033}}
