Our eldest \ndaughter did that a couple of times on her ipod. I woke up at 1 am to find her \nstill on the couch researching on her ipod. We have never adhered to a strict \nbedtime as such but we have faciliated bedtimes when it became apparent they \nhave needed to go to sleep. This is just an extension of attachment parenting. \nFor us that meant reading the tired signs in our babies and either babywearing \nor breastfeeding (or driving about in a car!) to help sleep happen. I feel the \nipod or computer or television continues to stimulate and enable our daughter to \nignore her tired signals and stay awake much longer than she would if she wasn’t \nwatching something. She’s ok to have us help her to just turn the tv or the \ncomputer or the ipod off and go to bed. It’s a process of facilitation, is the \nbest word I can think of to describe it. Sometimes its 9 or 9 :30, sometimes its \n10:30. She’s much happier that we are with her in this bedtime process than for \nher to be left alone to figure it out by herself.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Kirsty</font></div>\n<div\n style='FONT-SIZE:small;TEXT-DECORATION:none;FONT-FAMILY:\"Calibri\";FONT-WEIGHT:normal;COLOR:#000000;FONT-STYLE:normal;DISPLAY:inline;'>\n<div style=\"FONT:10pt tahoma;\"><font size=\"3\" face=\"Calibri\"></font><font size=\"3\"\n face=\"Calibri\"></font><font size=\"3\" face=\"Calibri\"></font></div>\n<div\n style='FONT-SIZE:small;TEXT-DECORATION:none;FONT-FAMILY:\"Calibri\";FONT-WEIGHT:normal;COLOR:#000000;FONT-STYLE:normal;DISPLAY:inline;'></div></div></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":545877370,"authorName":"Megan Valnes","from":"Megan Valnes &lt;meganvalnes@...&gt;","profile":"pjlzslove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Staying up very late","postDate":"1398956895","msgId":74195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQ00tMVlYTVlZRWtjM3pDcWJUOG82MDUtMmFqb3FfV3BvNjhwaV9BNCs0NXVQPW5GUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74198,"prevInTime":74194,"nextInTime":74196,"topicId":74195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, We started radically unschooling mid-February of this year, so about 2 1/2 months ago.
