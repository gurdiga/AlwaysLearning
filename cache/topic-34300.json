She is a teacher (I had<br/>\nher for 2 years in highschool for math!) and I was also a teacher for<br/>\n4 years before my daughter was born. My mom actually was the first one<br/>\nto say to me that she thought I should think about homeschooling<br/>\nbecause I would &quot;be so good at it&quot; (definitely more of a schooly<br/>\nmentality). My reaction at the time, was &quot;why would I do that?!?&quot; Now<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking about it but it is not exactly what she had in mind :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, we were discussing some parenting things and she said once<br/>\nagain that she feels like &quot;as long as you love them (your kids) they<br/>\nwill turn out ok&quot;. She also mentioned once again how much she did<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; and how happy she is with how things went with my sister and<br/>\nI. The things that she did &quot;wrong&quot; were things like rocking me to<br/>\nsleep, letting me nap in a swing etc. It was the first time that I<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Mom, what I&#39;M saying is that those things WERE NOT wrong!&quot; It<br/>\nis so funny how even after all this time she labels them wrong....<br/>\neven when she sees me doing things the way I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I didn&#39;t say it to her but I disagree with the statement &quot;as long<br/>\nas you love them&quot; for a few reasons. First of all I think that almost<br/>\nALL parents love their children (maybe on different levels?) and that<br/>\ndefinitely does not mean that all parents are doing a great job.<br/>\nSecond of all, I like to believe that the choices we make really do<br/>\nmake a difference in our lives and our children&#39;s lives. I think that<br/>\nmy mom did many of the attachment parenting things without<br/>\nknowing/labeling. My sister and I never really rebelled! And her and I<br/>\nhave always had a great relationship.... I understand her desire to<br/>\nnot JUDGE others because I really try not to do that too (and don&#39;t<br/>\nenjoy the feeling when others are doing it to me!) -- but on some<br/>\nlevel I know that I do because I feel so strongly about the choices I<br/>\nam making... any thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34282,"nextTopicId":34302}}
