But he didn&#39;t name it, I told him what the name of the game Keith had <br/>\nplayed years before had been.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Marty had said was &quot;I&#39;m thinking we could play a game with boffers, and <br/>\na ball with hair, like a head, and...&quot; and he went off on details and I zoned <br/>\nout thinking how very weird that Keith (whom Marty is SO much like) had been <br/>\nso excited about the very same game like 25 years before that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules evolved after several sessions and have settled, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boffer swords are built with pvc water pipe (I don&#39;t know measurements, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m guesing 3/4&quot;) covered with foam insulation (made for that pipe) and <br/>\nthen covered with duct tape, and the end padded with more foam and more duct <br/>\ntape.   The end of the hilt is taped over so the PVC isn&#39;t dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe balls were birthday gifts last year.  When he said he wanted to play it, <br/>\nKeith and I secretly made him three orc balls (Marty chooses to spell it &quot;ork <br/>\nball&quot; who knows why) with smallish playground balls, like four-square balls, <br/>\nbut in different colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of those is still around, but its original clown wig is worn to a nub, <br/>\nand Marty put another wig on it, only on the side of its face.   I&#39;ll try to <br/>\nupload a picture I took of it today, and some other orkball pictures in a bit.  I <br/>\n borrowed a camera and need to learn how to use it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are two shields on the ground (wooden shield blanks my husband had; <br/>\nI know not everyone will have such things, but you could use two anythings, <br/>\nlike bases).<br/>\n<br/>\nTeams are five people, usually.  Six today, four in a pinch, but ideally <br/>\nfive, with alternates if there are extra people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey play to seven points.  When there are seven total points, that&#39;s <br/>\nhalftime.  When one team has seven points, that&#39;s game.  The seven comes from SCA <br/>\nbusiness of 25 years ago, involving the seven dwarves.   (I was Snow White TWICE, <br/>\nand was in the newspaper once for it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny kind of passing is fair.  They can throw it, kick it, carry it, or bat it <br/>\nwith the boffer.<br/>\nAny kind of catching is fair.  Tapping it with the boffer and catching it as <br/>\nit falls, picking it up off the ground, catching it whole or by the hair, <br/>\ntaking it away from someone else American football-style.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can hit another player with a boffer.  They started off only hitting the <br/>\ncarrier, but that rule changed.   If you&#39;re the carrier and you&#39;re hit, you <br/>\nhave to drop the ball.   Someone else can pick it up.  If you&#39;re hit and you&#39;re <br/>\nnot carrying, you can hit back, but nobody &quot;has to die&quot; (in boffer-fighting <br/>\nterms, there&#39;s no accepting a blow as a wound or a death, because you weren&#39;t a <br/>\nlegal target).  If you were carrying and you&#39;re hit, you let the ball go back <br/>\ninto play, and you can&#39;t play again until you resurrect yourself by touching <br/>\nboth shoulders to the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was there today and saw some kids somersault, and some just kind of throw <br/>\nthemselves on their backs and roll over to the other side, get up and go again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a goalie.   They switch around who&#39;s going to be goalie.  Poor Arik, <br/>\nwho&#39;s 14 or 15, already a big guy and a good and experienced player, today <br/>\nmade four goals--two for his team, and two for the opponents, when he was goalie. <br/>\n He let a ball through, and he bounced the ball off another player, back into <br/>\nthe goal..  It happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd...    Some kids have gotten really angry because they got hit too hard.  <br/>\nKirby twisted his ankle a few weeks ago and had to miss a day of karate <br/>\n(missed his own class, missed a class he teaches).   Occasionally frustration breaks <br/>\nout, but they&#39;ve so far always found ways to make peace and stay friends.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly, our walking calendar, noted that they had had their anniversary a <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago.  They had played first with a wigless ball, and then on <br/>\nMarty&#39;s birthday last year we gifted him with the bewigged assortment.   (Our <br/>\nbedroom was very stinky from contact cement.  I slept woozy one night a year ago!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what Marty wanted for his birthday this year was a big ork ball game.  <br/>\nTwenty people were there at the height of it.  We fed pizza and cake to 18 <br/>\nafterward.  Some of them are in the library now playing something in the dark.  I <br/>\nwent to double check on the points and halftime, and slid open the door and <br/>\nasked the darkness my questions, and three different voices gave answers.  I <br/>\nthanked them and shut the door.  They didn&#39;t ask why I wanted to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love these kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36624936,"authorName":"Jenny E.","from":"&quot;Jenny E.&quot; &lt;mom2jrjedis@...&gt;","profile":"mom2jrjedis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Ork Ball","postDate":"1073877748","msgId":17835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWMzZDhiYiQ0ZWUxN2JmMCQwN2U0MWI0MkBFbGxpb3R0RmFtaWx5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17841,"prevInTime":17834,"nextInTime":17836,"topicId":17835,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, I keep meaning to ask you...is ork ball a game that the kids learned to play or is it something that Marty and Co. created?
