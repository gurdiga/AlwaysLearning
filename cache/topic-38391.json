I, personally, can&#39;t fall asleep to music-I have too  <br/>\nmuch urge to sing, dance, keep rhythm, hum, move. All that keeps me awake. Dave  <br/>\nfalls asleep to music that is so fast and hard, I can&#39;t listen to it except <br/>\nwhen  I&#39;m in the *right* mood. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with <br/>\nanother,  but he can fall asleep almost anywhere-including once standing up at an <br/>\nairport.  For a person like me, who needs conditions *just so* to be able to <br/>\nfall asleep,  it escapes my understanding.
