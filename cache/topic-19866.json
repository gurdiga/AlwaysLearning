Several messages suggested the positive aspects of sharing. <br/>\nI had thought and said that &quot;sharing is fun&quot;, but had empathized with <br/>\nhim that &quot;waiting is hard&quot;. I now see that this projected a negative <br/>\nattitude on the events surrounding waiting. I gleemed that I could <br/>\ntry to change the waiting to fun, but I felt that I had tried that  <br/>\nwith distractions, alternative toys, redirecting, etc. I had even <br/>\nexplained that we all &quot;had&quot; to wait but that we could do something <br/>\nwhile we waited, like sing or whatever to make it fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as my son and I were drawing together, he stopped and <br/>\nwatched me draw. Then, I realized that &quot;watching&quot; someone else take a <br/>\nturn could be fun itself. This eliminated &quot;waiting&quot; entirely. <br/>\nWatching someone take a turn could be its own activity! I also <br/>\nappreciated the suggestion on line to share the person&#39;s enjoyment <br/>\nwhile they were taking their turn. In advance of having company, I <br/>\nbegan suggesting the idea of letting the company take a turn first so <br/>\nthat we could watch. THIS WORKED!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have noticed Erik playing &quot;taking turns&quot; and &quot;watching&quot;. He <br/>\nhas incorporated it into his pretend play. It is amazing how I <br/>\nprojected this without realizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sharing","postDate":"1087323197","msgId":19873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NC4zN2E0YWM1YS4yZTAwOTYzZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19870,"nextInTopic":19960,"prevInTime":19872,"nextInTime":19874,"topicId":19866,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/15/04 5:23:25 AM, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-814643124\">In a message dated 6/15/04 5:23:25 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And &quot;practice sharing&quot;????

It&#39;s a great plan if that three year old isn&#39;t having <br/>\ncompany over who need toys to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way I handled sharing with kids who visited was to have toys that were <br/>\nMINE, or the whole family&#39;s, and I shared.  Kirby&#39;s Ninja Turtles were never <br/>\nshared unless he chose to.  If we had many kids over, they were put up and away.  <br/>\nMarty&#39;s Lego, ditto.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a &quot;he&#39;s company, let him choose&quot; default tie-breaker rule if they were <br/>\ndeciding who got to play which role, or who had first pick of swords or <br/>\nwhatever.  That worked well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Marty was horning in on Kirby&#39;s play and Kirby was getting grumpy, I would <br/>\nextract one of them tactfully/subtly (usually Marty) to do something better.  <br/>\nSee a bird&#39;s nest, very quietly, or help me choose what to make for lunch, or <br/>\ncheck the mailbox, and sit on the porch and go through the pile.   Both <br/>\ncalmed down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most knock-down, drag-out fight I ever remember, there were three <br/>\nvisiting kids, when they were all in the 3-6 age range and we had all our mostly-used <br/>\nFisher Price stuff out.  Lots of people, buildings, cars.   And somehow <br/>\neverybody wanted the farmer.  Whoever didn&#39;t have the farmer was screaming, and <br/>\nwhoever DID have the farmer was screaming to protect it from everyone else trying <br/>\nto take it.  I came in, and being the tallest said &quot;Wait, let me hold the <br/>\nfarmer a minute!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my lame suggestions were helping, and I thought &quot;Hmmm....   when did <br/>\nI give them a snack?  Ooops...&quot;  I think they wanted to eat the farmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I made lunch with the farmer in my pocket and figured we&#39;d have lots of <br/>\nways to see who got the farmer first, and next...  But after lunch they took off <br/>\nto do other things.  I parked the farmer in his tractor by his silo, and <br/>\nnobody ever played with the poor farmer for the rest of the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sharing","postDate":"1087298222","msgId":19869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmLjQ4ZGUzMzlmLjJlMDAzNGFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19867,"nextInTopic":19870,"prevInTime":19868,"nextInTime":19870,"topicId":19866,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/14/2004 10:18:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time, scubamama@earthlink.net writes: But what  is your principle about having to share?
