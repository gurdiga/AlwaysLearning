I find that I can discuss parenting with<br/>\nmost of my friends. Our styles differ, but I find that we are pretty<br/>\ntolerant of each other. In groups I tend to avoid people who interact with<br/>\ntheir children (or adults) in ways I find upsetting. I avoid people who are<br/>\ndisrepectful or who don&#39;t listen. I avoid people who react instead of<br/>\nresponding. I do judge other parenting styles, but I keep my judgements to<br/>\nmyself and talk about things with the other 2 mommies here if I need to<br/>\ndiscuss something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of weird for me though. I have a few, very long-standing<br/>\nfriendships (over 25 years) and I don&#39;t think those friendships will ever<br/>\nend. My oldest friends live in NYC, and I haven&#39;t lived there in 17 years.<br/>\nOnly one of those people has children. He and I have always had &quot;ideological<br/>\ndifferences&quot; (for lack of a better term at the moment). We have long since<br/>\nlearned how to discuss them and find common ground or let them drop. I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee him parent on a day-to-day basis, so our parenting styles/lifestyles are<br/>\nnot an issue. My friend Jo visits at least once a month. She is single and<br/>\nchildless. (Yes, I am using that word deliberately. If she met someone she<br/>\nwanted to marry, she would marry and have kids. She even thought about<br/>\nhaving kids on her own, but her current living situation makes that<br/>\nimpossible.) She would not be an unschooler never mind a radical unschooler,<br/>\nbut she respects and supports our choices even if she does bring the kids<br/>\neducational materials. To her credit, she doesn&#39;t care if they use them or<br/>\nnot. She is wonderful in that she listens to the guys and follows their<br/>\ndesires when she&#39;s here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely see my friends from New Orleans. (We left New Orleans the day<br/>\nbefore Hurricane Katrina and then settled in Connecticut.) The friendships<br/>\nwe were building there were interrupted by the hurricane in a way I&#39;m too<br/>\ntired to explain right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have only been in Connecticut for 3 years and have met a number of<br/>\nhomeschoolers, most of whom we don&#39;t socialize with outside of groups<br/>\nevents. In the groups we do attend at least twice a month, there are a few<br/>\npeople who don&#39;t even understand unschooling. I&#39;ve been told, &quot;Well, even<br/>\nunschoolers use workbooks and some cirriculum.&quot; Even when they ask about our<br/>\nday-to-day lives, they just don&#39;t hear that I don&#39;t teach my guys. I model<br/>\nthings for them, explore things with them, and participate in their learning<br/>\non their terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish we could socialize with more radical unschoolers on a more regular<br/>\nbasis. So far, our attempts at making spaces for that to happen haven&#39;t<br/>\nworked out, but we&#39;re still working on it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really grateful for the people I&quot;ve met at conferences and those I&quot;ve<br/>\nmet on-line. People like you Kelly :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if that answered your question, but it was interesting for me<br/>\nto puzzle through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n(ps.

I  <br/>\nknew almost everyone there; only a few knew Holly and some hadn&#39;t seen  <br/>\nher since she was a baby.   The bride to be is older than I am.  She&#39;s  <br/>\nlived with the same man for 35 years, but they never were married.    <br/>\nMost of the guests were older than I am.  The &quot;younger&quot; ones were in  <br/>\ntheir 40&#39;s.  Then there were two teens whose mothers were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Holly, before we went, to go easy on any talk or jokes of  <br/>\nchildren.   The party organizer is married and childless.  The hostess  <br/>\nwas never married but I think she would like to have been.   The bride  <br/>\nto be has had a pituitary tumor for many years, and couldn&#39;t have  <br/>\nchildren because what they&#39;re giving her to control the tumor couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nbe taken during pregnancy.

She was pregnant once, by accident, and had to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was basically fifteen old hippie women, almost all childless, and a  <br/>\nfew friends and relatives.
