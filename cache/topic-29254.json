I&#39;ve<br/>\nreceived this advice many times from family and well-meaning friends in<br/>\nmy own life.  I have three children, Julia (9), Ian (5) and a 10 month<br/>\nold baby, Adam.  Julia adores being at home and proudly tells anyone who<br/>\nasks that she is &quot;unschooled.&quot; &quot;Not homeschooled, UNschooled,&quot; she will<br/>\nsay.  Ian is autistic and caring for him, keeping him safe and<br/>\nunschooling him within his &quot;special needs&quot; can be extremely challenging.<br/>\nSo my family doesn&#39;t understand why I wouldn&#39;t &quot;send&quot; Julia to school<br/>\nbecause it would then be easier for me to care for Ian at home and still<br/>\n&quot;manage&quot; the baby.  Nice message this would send Julia-&quot;Hey kid, I can<br/>\nsacrifice your needs and send you to school over your brother&#39;s needs.&quot;<br/>\nUnschooling for me is really about meeting my children&#39;s needs first and<br/>\nfinding other solutions to challenges in my life that don&#39;t require that<br/>\nmy children suffer or give up what they deeply desire and love.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI really liked the previous advice about slowing down and really taking<br/>\nthe time to see what your kids want to do and enjoy.  I&#39;ve let go of so<br/>\nmany &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and have learned to outsource (cleaning lady, lawn<br/>\nguy), in order to really be with my kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI haven&#39;t posted before because I really don&#39;t have much time during the<br/>\nday (or night!).

They&#39;re happy to sit on the edge of the tub and talk to me while I clean, <br/>\nif I&#39;m listening to them instead of thinking &quot;gotta do this, gotta do that&quot; thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI give them spray bottles of soapy water and let them do the squirting for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good thing is to ask &quot;what would you like to play?&quot; sometimes, instead of &quot;what <br/>\nwould you like to do&quot; (which is also good of course, but can sometimes overwhelm a <br/>\nyoung child--too many possibilities! And--I&#39;m in the middle of grasping this right now--if <br/>\nthey&#39;re used to you saying No or Not Now a lot, then they might be hesitant to put an idea <br/>\nout there for fear it&#39;ll be shot down. Once they see that you&#39;re receptive to their <br/>\nsuggestions, the suggestions begin to come fast and thick.) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What should we play?&quot; is an exciting question. It means mom is open to PLAYING with <br/>\nyou--not just setting you up with something to do so she can go back to her stuff. I really <br/>\nthink there is nothing my 7 & unders like more than for me to play Pretty Ponies with <br/>\nthem, or Playmobil, or something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older ones are more into making stuff. Sculpey, paper crafts, knitting, etc. Oh, and <br/>\nbaking.  I have never known a child (of any age) to turn down an offer to make cookies. :)<br/>\nA 7yo can scramble eggs or make pancakes, with mom&#39;s help. My 6yo could happily spend <br/>\nan entire morning flipping pancakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday the 6yo, 8yo, and I sat for 45 minutes watching a spider in our sunroom trap <br/>\nants. I was laughing inside, because it was like I was being rewarded for this big shift I&#39;m <br/>\nmaking to saying yes as often as possible--earlier, I had been about to sweep that room, <br/>\nbroom in my hand and everything, but one of the kids asked for help with something, and <br/>\ninstead of my usual &quot;hang on, I need to do this first&quot; (believe me, with five kids I know <br/>\nabout the daily grind!!), I said, &quot;Sure, honey.&quot; And I never did get back to sweeping that <br/>\nroom. Which is why the spider and the ants were still there for my kids to find later. We <br/>\nwatched them for the longest time. There were dozens of dead ant bodies lying under the <br/>\nweb. If we poked the web, the spider would run around and around in circles so fast we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see his legs. He was looking for the next ant. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday they want me to read them Charlotte&#39;s Web. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: boredom at unschooling homeschool - help!","postDate":"1181578407","msgId":29266,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0anNiNytubnM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0am4waytjdjB1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29264,"nextInTopic":29267,"prevInTime":29265,"nextInTime":29267,"topicId":29254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You get some or most of the problems of school no  <br/>\nmatter how much you call it &quot;free&quot; or &quot;co-op&quot; or &quot;democratic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the recommendation &quot;send her to school&quot; can be found in  <br/>\nmagazines, phone book, billboard, TV ads, and from every chit-chatty  <br/>\nperson at the grocery store, I would much prefer that this list not  <br/>\nbecome a place where one of the first recommendations is &quot;send her to  <br/>\nschool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who have never been to school are rare, and sending them to  <br/>\nschool for a while isn&#39;t the path to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all paths lead to unschooling, and that&#39;s fine.

School is always an option, and it&#39;s  <br/>\ninfinitely better for the family if they see that option and choose  <br/>\nagainst it every year, instead of declaring at some point that they  <br/>\nwill NEVER, &quot;could&quot; NEVER, send their children to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat thinking of &quot;not an option&quot; makes all involved more powerless,  <br/>\nmore trapped, less free.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom doesn&#39;t come from &quot;a free school,&quot; it comes from making  <br/>\nconscious choices and then acting on those choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing to unschool and then not DOING it, but waiting for it to  <br/>\nstart to develop on its own after all the floors are mopped isn&#39;t the  <br/>\nway for it to take firm hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] boredom at unschooling homeschool - help!","postDate":"1181571230","msgId":29259,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxNEFGMkE1LTBFMjAtNEY5My1CMjVGLUQyNDNGODQ0M0MzM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0aW9wMCszcTU1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGY0aW9wMCszcTU1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29258,"nextInTopic":29260,"prevInTime":29258,"nextInTime":29260,"topicId":29254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-my dd is almost 7 and really bored at home with me unschooling and her 1 year old sister. -=- It seems you see unschooling as a thing you do to them (even","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1642030960\">-=-my dd is almost 7 and<br/>\nreally bored at home with me unschooling and her 1 year old sister. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems you see unschooling as a thing you do to them (even the one  <br/>\nyear old).<br/>\nThat must just seem more of a huge burden of things you have to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-i&#39;m being driven mad by housework and baby stuff and the usual daily<br/>\ngrind-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could put your daughter in school (a bad idea I see someone else  <br/>\nhas already recommended, but I don&#39;t recommend).<br/>\nIf you decide NOT to put your daughter in school, then you should  <br/>\nimmediately rethink all of you &quot;usual daily&quot; EVERYthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in school, your daughter would be in an environment different  <br/>\nfrom &quot;the usual daily grind&quot; for six or eight hours, then YOU should  <br/>\nprovide six or eight hours of interesting activities for her.
