No diving head first into the pool. Walking, not running, around the deck. No holding other people underwater. And sometimes if a kid was being very annoying to the other kids, I&#39;d say, &quot;No splashing someone in their face on purpose,&quot; as if that was a regular rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stepped in, whether a kid&#39;s parent was there or not. I did ask other parents to come and be watchers - so that I didn&#39;t end up spending quite as much time out there watching - I could go in and at least move laundry from washer to dryer or go to the bathroom, etc. But I would not have allowed other kids to play in our pool if I was going to wait for their parents to enforce my very minimal pool rules.  I was nice about it, but very clear. &quot;If you guys want to play in the pool, then you have to obey the rules.&quot; There were a few kids, over the years, who wouldn&#39;t abide by the rules and, at first, I&#39;d just say, &quot;Hey, johnny, sit on the side of the pool for a minute.&quot; Then I&#39;d go over and talk with him and tell him that he wouldn&#39;t be able to play in the pool if he ran on the deck or dived in head first from the side. If he forgot (and it was clear to me he&#39;d forgotten). I&#39;d remind a time or two. They knew I meant it. Only one time ever, in about 20 years, did I actually send a kid home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, you are providing swords, like I was providing the pool. I would be comfortable with stepping forward and saying, &quot;You are welcome to play with our swords if you don&#39;t hit on heads.&quot; Something like that. Some parents can&#39;t seem to tell their kids to stop anything�or they overreact and they punish them or shame them when they could have just reminded them or told them to stop. If you step in first, nicely remind them not to hit in the head, the ineffectual parent won&#39;t have the chance to overreact and punish. <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sword Play and Neighbors","postDate":"1319225448","msgId":63539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTkyMjU0NDguNTM0ODYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwOS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGo3czdoYytsaXFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM4RjI4OUI5LTE4MUEtNDlGOS04QTJDLURDMENFMThDMTU4OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGo3czdoYytsaXFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63528,"nextInTopic":63542,"prevInTime":63538,"nextInTime":63540,"topicId":63509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I feel a little uncomfortable at that thought of telling siblings not to hit each other, even though they are our weapons, when mom is standing there.

She&#39;s really bossy and insulting and mean to them and it&#39;s just not any fun to be around her.  If I had stayed on my own porch to watch the kids then she wouldn&#39;t have said anything to me about hating swords and I wouldn&#39;t have heard her telling the kids over and over to stop playing swords.  Last time the neighbors gathered on her porch while the kids played we asked where her daughter was and she said, &quot;She really likes to come outside to play and she&#39;s in trouble so we took that away from her.&quot;  I think after that I should have known better than to go to her porch to say hi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Christine wrote something better than I did about playing with swords.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This wasn&#39;t clear, sorry; I&#39;ll try to clarify:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-Not hitting each other that way should be cause for taking the swords back.

We&#39;ve had huge battles inside our house & out, plus my kids attended a sword fighting school & camp (I worked there, too). Rule #1: No head shots - that means anything from the top of the shoulders up. Rule #2: Never hit in anger. (There are more that are necessary for large groups of kids in a class/camp setting but I don&#39;t think they need to be listed here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone, no matter the age (we have adult classes and mixed-age events), who breaks any of these very important safety rules gets warnings or is removed from the activity (depending upon the severity or frequency of the behavior). Someone stays with the person and, if needed, discusses the situation when they are calmer. We focus on how the person has ownership of their behaviors & how to deal with their angry or frustrated feelings, not refereeing or figuring out who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese kids are young & it&#39;s very hard for them to pull back when upset. Having a weapon, even a play one, can make them feel more powerful during a frustrating situation and they may then impulsively use it in anger. Adult supervision is so vital for this kind of thing since you don&#39;t know them, their personalities and their temperaments. After you all get to know each other better the supervision might be tapered off and the kids can monitor themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever you have other kids at your house you are going to find that they may have very different expectations about how adults will talk to them. Other parents will have different ideas about what is safe and acceptable play. Clear communication and respecting others&#39; way of doing things is so important when developing new relationships. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Christine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-We just got new neighbors and two of their three kids beat each other with the swords in anger.
