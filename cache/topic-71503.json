The website is wwme.org, and I believe some state chapters also have their own website (mine does for Arizona).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weekend format appears to be the same as Retrouvaille, but there are not any scheduled follow-up meetings.  Instead, on the website there is a page for &quot;After Your Weekend&quot; suggestions.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fee schedule also appears to be the same.  You are asked to pay an upfront registration fee, and during the weekend program you will be asked to give a freewill donation with the caveat that no couple is turned away if they cannot pay.  The only difference I noticed for my local chapter is that the registration fee is less for the WWME vs. Retrouvaille. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken Sandra&#39;s suggestion seriously to make my marriage a priority over unschooling.
