As others have mentioned.  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-411363411\">Reading these posts, I was thinking that what may help you would be to try to at least pinpoint the &#39;shoulds&#39; in your own mind. As others have mentioned. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes if I am feeling very negative about something, it is because my idea of the outcome does not match reality (eg: I want to go outside, and i want my son to want to go outside, but my son wants to stay indoors). I can start to get frustrated, and annoyed with my child. Often this is because I am thinking he &#39;should&#39; go outside, but if I can let go of that idea, maybe I can see what else lies underneath, and think about trying to meet those needs. Or at least figure out what they are, and whether or not I truly want to bring them into fruition, or can. Eg: perhaps it is okay that my son&#39;s needs are staying at home right now playing with Lego, and my need is to get some time outdoors (so maybe I can go outside with my daughter, and my son can stay at home with daddy for an hour or so). Or, if that is not possible, can I accept my desire (for fresh air and sunshine, or a change of scene, eg) and promise myself I will take care of that need maybe tomorrow, or next week say? or find sone other way to &#39;change the scene&#39; ie: rejuvenate at home (listening to music, having a cup of tea & some chocolate, say). Or could my son come to the park with his Lego?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing that can help with this type of processing, is to try to understand the underlying thoughts (often for me, fears) that drive these conflicts. Eg: fear my son will not get space and time to be physical and run around outside while it&#39;s daylight, say, or fear that I will never get outdoors...for your food related thoughts perhaps there is a fear that no nutritious food will get eaten by your children? Of course that is just a guess, used as an example.<br/>\nMy thought is that once you can listen to your fears and underlying needs and desires, and give them respect and space to be heard, then you may well find that you can take onboard the many varied practical suggestions you have been offered by this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course (I hope this is somewhat assumed) your children&#39;s needs are equally valid. They may not be immediately fulfillable (the same way as your own) but I do find that truly listening to them can find a way to meet them, usually. As an example of that, someone posted on an unschooling list about their children wanting to eat some inedible foaming cleaning product. The responses they got were, I thought, very problem-solving and thoughtful. They revolved around trying to see what it was that the children were trying to experience (eating something light and fluffly, or playing with and experiencing the foam, eg). And then, once that had theoretically been figured out, finding solutions to that: spray cream eg, or for the other purpose of playing perhaps shaving foam in the bath. Very occasionally needs/desires can not be met in that moment - I can not go and hug my dear Nana again (because she is no longer alive) or my son&#39;s favorite shop is closed, say, so we can&#39;t go. And then I try to give room for processing these feelings. And if the example I gave of my son&#39;s needs seemed exceptionally out of proportion to my Nana being no longer alive, I do think that there is some very profound learning about the nature of life and the power we have as individuals to change what is unchangeable and those are difficult things to take on board and process. Though if I was desperate to buy something from a closed shop (the only pharmacist in the area, say, and I needed a prescription) I would have options. And the shops in my childhood were always closed on Sundays, which has now changed due to consumer pressure. But hopefully you get my point. Problem solving is the key. I read in your posts that you have some resistance to problem solving & when I find myself doing that, it means that I would benefit greatly from stepping back and exploring what I am really feeling, and afraid of, and what all people involved really need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to remember that many things in life are more negotiable and fluid than they would (at first) appear, at least that is my experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd life with three little ones sounds intense! Hang on in there, and try to carve out some calm space or time for yourself if (& when) you can. Or promise yourself you will do that soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nCornelia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291337950,"authorName":"alma","from":"&quot;alma&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt;","profile":"almadoing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323199543","msgId":64151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpibHE3bitqb2dzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiajQ5citvMGpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64148,"nextInTopic":64154,"prevInTime":64150,"nextInTime":64152,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I practice both radical unschooling and Buddhism.

I loosely followed many Buddhist practices before becoming a parent but when I became a parent I found much of my Buddhist practice went out the window (lack of time, energy, headspace, no opportunity to be part of a sangha or go on retreat). As my children got older I discovered radical unschooling. As they got older still I reached out to Buddhism again, and it was then that I realised the immense overlap between Buddhist practice and radical unschooling. My Buddhist teacher said once that Buddhism is a way of life that can be lived without ever having heard of Buddhism, that aliens could arrive, tell us about their values and way of life and we could say, &quot;Ah, they&#39;re Buddhists.&quot; When she said that I immediately thought of Sandra :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saying this because I don&#39;t want you to back off from this list because of any perceived lack of understanding of the importance of Buddhism in your life. Advice on this list has helped me no end to see that my children give me fantastic opportunities to develop as a parent, a person and a Buddhist practitioner. That is because so much of the advice on this list is about truly opening your eyes and heart to your actual real children in front of you, and how you can be aware and kind and connected to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is so much good advice given on this thread but I&#39;d like to add a couple of things<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said<br/>\n=-=-= We like [family dinner] to be a time for quiet nourishment and reflection on our day together as a family. I am a practicing Buddhist and I try to encourage mindful eating. It&#39;s difficult when everyone is running around crazy. So there are a few reasons we prefer everyone sit and eat dinner together in the evening. =-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to reiterate what others have said about this being about your needs. I&#39;m not sure what the most important aspect of this is for you but here are some thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n·When the children are asleep/otherwise engaged the adults can have this kind of meal.<br/>\n·When the children are eating the adults might introduce mindful eating practices.<br/>\n·Evening dinner time is often the most crazy time in many homes with young children. Maybe early mornings, after a meal or bedtimes would be easier for quiet family reflection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess these points add up to meeting the children where they are, rather than dragging them to where you are. I try to be opportunistic about these quiet reflective times with my family. Sometimes with one child, sometimes with whole family etc. But I try to be mindful of them when they arise rather than try and pin them down to a schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said<br/>\n=-=-= Perfection is not the goal, avoiding complete chaos and making sure everyone&#39;s needs, including the grown-ups in the house, are met. I just feel that some routine and guidelines can help in that regard. =-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention you like structure and routine and if this is the case it may feel chaotic and overwhelming without it. I have found that if I am mindful I notice the rhythms that arise in our family, bits of which may last days, weeks or longer. If I fall in with them as much as possible rather than decide in advance what they should be, it is sooo much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tip I believe I read here once that might appeal to your love of structure is, rather than to plan what is going to happen today/tomorrow, you could try to record what has happened yesterday/today. When I did this I discovered so much about the good things that were happening and, even more surprisingly, solutions for problems just kept popping up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought, on the practical side, regarding the mess. Is it possible in your home to have a room reserved for quiet, peaceful, non-messy activities, even a bedroom? We have one room in our house that I try to keep 5 minutes from peaceful. This means I steer things away from this room if messy, I pay more attention to tidying and cleaning it, I keep candles and matches handy etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could keep on writing and writing and I think it is because I really feel for where you are. So much of what you say reminds me of where I was at the point just before really getting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nDS1(9) and DS2(6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jenlea79&quot; &lt;jenlea79@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t quite follow this.

Perfection is not the goal, avoiding complete chaos and making sure everyone&#39;s needs, including the grown-ups in the house, are met.

But this is apparently a very basic and broad argument against radical unschooling, that I am sure you have addressed a zillion times.  I am not trying to live up to the label of unschooling or radical unschooling.  Another core teaching of Buddhism, is that attachment leads to suffering.  I&#39;m not going to attach myself to the idea that I absolutely can&#39;t ask my children to abide by certain guidelines to make this household run more smoothly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You seem to be impying that I am wanting to claim to be an unschooler and a buddhist just for the heck of it, without really believing in the principles of either.  This is completely untrue.  I despise labels.  I rarely mention either to anybody, as I don&#39;t see a need to.  I&#39;m simply trying out different philosophies of life because I see those around me suffering greatly and want something different for my family.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to stop now, because there&#39;s no use keeping on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I made a mistake posting in this group.

If you step back and think<br/>\n&gt; about your real overriding principle of fostering family closeness, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; realize that dinner together is not only not the only way to adhere to your<br/>\n&gt; overriding principle and that forcing dinner together can even be<br/>\n&gt; counterproductive to the big principle.

She has always loved to have her hands busily creating art of<br/>\n&gt; all kinds. When she was 6 and I had a 4 year old and a 1 year old - we had<br/>\n&gt; art supplies outdoors really a lot. We had an easel and big sheets of paper<br/>\n&gt; and lots of tempera paint to play with outside. We made playdough<br/>\n&gt; frequently - added all kinds of stuff to it such as oatmeal or pineapple<br/>\n&gt; flavoring. That was played with outdoors on the patio, too. They played<br/>\n&gt; with fingerpaints in the bathtub (and sometimes fingerpainted with instant<br/>\n&gt; pudding in the tub). I bought really super good quality colored pencils<br/>\n&gt; and crayons and there was always a lot of paper of all kinds around.<br/>\n&gt; Scissors and tape were available. The pencils, scissors, tape, and paper<br/>\n&gt; were kept up all in a clear plastic box up just out of reach of the 1 yo.<br/>\n&gt; Clean up meant dumping everything back into the big plastic box and putting<br/>\n&gt; it back up on a shelf.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, they don&#39;t need craft projects, but art supplies, yes. We had a card<br/>\n&gt; table set up in a bedroom and they would take the art supplies box and go<br/>\n&gt; in there and shut the door and I&#39;d keep the 1 year old happy somewhere<br/>\n&gt; else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Make things interesting by adding things to the art supplies box over time.<br/>\n&gt; Add a single hole puncher. Add some yarn. Add some old birthday cards or<br/>\n&gt; holiday cards. Popsicle sticks. Whatever you run into, add it. Just put<br/>\n&gt; them in the box - you don&#39;t have to make up a project to do with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again - what is the big principle here? Offer stimulating and interesting<br/>\n&gt; learning activities, maybe?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you need to think more in terms of setting the stage for letting<br/>\n&gt; them learn and less about yourself being in charge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to go back to the family closeness thing and dinner. My family is<br/>\n&gt; really very very close. My oldest daughter is 27 and married and she and<br/>\n&gt; her husband moved into a house that is a 1-minute walk from our front door.<br/>\n&gt; They love living that close to us. My daughters are each others&#39; best<br/>\n&gt; friends. We still do things as a family all the time - we all talk to each<br/>\n&gt; other every day. All that - and we had very few &quot;family dinners&quot; when the<br/>\n&gt; kids were growing up - those we had happened spontaneously or on special<br/>\n&gt; occasions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What counts for family closeness is shared experience. That&#39;s what that<br/>\n&gt; whole family dinner is supposed to create. But difficult, uncomfortable,<br/>\n&gt; forced family dinners don&#39;t create closeness - they create a desire to get<br/>\n&gt; away/escape.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is much much better to have lots of small moments of joy and kindness!<br/>\n&gt; It is all the small moments that build up over lifetimes to become real<br/>\n&gt; family closeness. Family dinner is intended to make sure there is time for<br/>\n&gt; loving family members to connect - that&#39;s it. Nothing else magical about<br/>\n&gt; it. But it is forced and artificial and unnatural to children to sit down<br/>\n&gt; for a meal like that. Children would almost always rather &quot;graze&quot; on food<br/>\n&gt; throughout the day and it is more healthy for them to do that. If you are<br/>\n&gt; worried about nutrition, forcing kids to sit at a dinner table and eat<br/>\n&gt; certain foods (or refuse to eat them and have all that negativity) is a<br/>\n&gt; sure-fire way to contribute to them having problems with food later on.<br/>\n&gt; Better to put your effort into having nutritious snacks that they can eat<br/>\n&gt; when hungry. Make a list of very simple, good, healthy foods that you can<br/>\n&gt; throw together. Make a list of dinners for you and your husband, too, that<br/>\n&gt; are super quick. Use only a few ingredients, not complicated recipes. For<br/>\n&gt; these years, while you have little children, you and your husband can eat<br/>\n&gt; very simply. Bread and soup is a good option, for example, that can be<br/>\n&gt; delicious and nutritious and super quick.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Big principle - supply kids with foods that will make them happy and<br/>\n&gt; healthy. Not a rule - they must eat the dinner I cook and if they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like that choose from a few limited options.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is hard to get a clear head when you have almost no down time, but you<br/>\n&gt; are looking at individual trees and missing the beauty of the forrest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Think a lot more about the process and not so much about product. The<br/>\n&gt; process is good if people are happy. That&#39;s the test that matters, not how<br/>\n&gt; good the product is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261223738,"authorName":"Claire Darbaud","from":"Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt;","profile":"cdarbaud","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323134177","msgId":64132,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRzB1VzhuSlFGc0phNFFvWUg1dWJUTk1PVjNEdlRhM2dEdG1mMXVlQUdHMDFrd1AtQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiaW5ubCtnNGZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpiaW5ubCtnNGZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64129,"nextInTopic":64138,"prevInTime":64131,"nextInTime":64133,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"2011/12/5 jenlea79  ...

I went back to work when my oldest<br/>\nwas 10 days old. I was totally certain my kids would go to daycare, and<br/>\nthen school... I was a career woman... I was going to have the right<br/>\nbalance of love and structure... I sure wasn&#39;t going to take any whims or<br/>\nwhining...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd life had other plans for me. It sent 2 tiny teachers my way. Getting<br/>\nthem to fit in my ideas of what should be is a struggle. Always was. I<br/>\nquickly got tired of struggling. I got tired of fighting my children. And<br/>\nstarted to look at the present they are offering. They are teaching me<br/>\nsurrender, and trust and love. 24/7. Struggling is a good sign that I have<br/>\nmore to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling people, on this list and in real life, are helping me get the<br/>\nmessage my kids are sending. Helping me to stop struggling and find peace.<br/>\nAnd joy :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like deb Lewis&#39; quote about power struggle very<br/>\nmuch: &quot;Power struggles can disappear when the person with the power stops<br/>\nstruggling.&quot; It&#39;s a good reminder for me. I&#39;m not there yet. But I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting better. Slowly. Very slowly. I wish it could go faster. I for one<br/>\nwas certain I could read my way out of deschooling in a blink (Yeh,<br/>\nright!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that&#39;s helping me these days is to remember to look where I<br/>\nwant to go. In life as in driving, you tend to set the motion to go towards<br/>\nwhere you&#39;re looking. Don&#39;t dwell on the obstacles or the motion will take<br/>\nyou there fast (and kids tends to be very &quot;what you expect is what you<br/>\nget&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure any of this helps... I think I should really be in bed by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you don&#39;t just give up and unsubscribe from this list. This place is<br/>\nthe best I know to get you out of struggling. It can be feel &quot;ouch&quot;<br/>\nsometimes. Or even &quot;no way!!!&quot;. But give it time. Read the list, try some<br/>\nof the stuff a little. Go gradually. Pick some of the stuff you find easier<br/>\nto agree with. And then take some time to feel if it&#39;s making a difference<br/>\nin your life. In a good way. Does it ease the struggle? Your life is the<br/>\nonly compass that matters really... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323130645","msgId":64129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPT0NreFdpLXhLKzBHZjA0PU5yNVJqM1BORTE0eVhXQkhPdXBOPXJrMFotUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiajQ5citvMGpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc0NzMzQkJGLTQ5NzQtNEY3My05N0MwLTE1Qjc5QUQyMTA5QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGpiajQ5citvMGpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64128,"nextInTopic":64132,"prevInTime":64128,"nextInTime":64130,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am<br/>\noffering you something that was offered to me 15+ years ago. Pay it<br/>\nforward! It can be very hard to be as detached as is needed to do the kind<br/>\nof thinking and self-examination that we do on this list, though. I<br/>\nthought, from your posts, that you were ready and able to handle the<br/>\ncomments I made and that they would be helpful, but your response indicates<br/>\nthat I was wrong and that they hurt you instead of giving you food for<br/>\nthought. I hope it helped someone else reading the list and I hope that you<br/>\nmight be willing to think about the ideas anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I can explain just a little more about what the &quot;we&quot; statements are<br/>\nsignificant and important to analyze.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we say what &quot;we&quot; think or want, including our husband and children in<br/>\nthe &quot;we,&quot; there is sometimes unrealistic wishful thinking involved. Often,<br/>\nwe wish they&#39;d want it like we do. Or, we assume they want it. If we clear<br/>\nthat up, we can look directly at what they really want and work together to<br/>\nsatisfy everyone. If we cling to the idea that everybody wants what we<br/>\nwant, things can get worse as others get more and more frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilly example:  I used to say, &quot;None of us likes pickle relish.&quot; I,<br/>\npersonally, can&#39;t stand the stuff and my husband doesn&#39;t like it and my<br/>\noldest daughter doesn&#39;t either. My other two daughters apparently never<br/>\nreally got the chance because I&#39;d just say, &quot;Ick, no, we don&#39;t like that<br/>\nstuff.&quot; One day my youngest daughter called me on it, saying, &quot;Mommy, you<br/>\nsay &quot;we don&#39;t like it&quot; but I really have no IDEA if I like it or not<br/>\nbecause YOU never gave me a chance to find out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so easy to do that kind of thing - to speak for others, to make<br/>\nassumptions, especially if we are the ones who are central core of our<br/>\nfamily life....we are, for example, the keepers of the information about<br/>\nwho likes what!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, wouldn&#39;t it be more kind, respectful, thoughtful, and conducive to<br/>\nlearning, if I had actually let my daughters try out some pickle relish to<br/>\nfind out if they did, indeed, like it or detest it as much as I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean that kids make every possible choice, but surely<br/>\nthey could have chosen pickle relish or not on those rare occasions that<br/>\nsomeone offered it to them without me butting in and saying, &quot;Oh, no, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t like pickle relish.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said - kind of a silly example and in the context of our entire<br/>\nlives, more humorous than awful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is an example of me using the word &quot;we&quot; inappropriately and running<br/>\nroughshod over my kids. Nobody feels good when someone else does that to<br/>\nthem. Being called on gave me more awareness of doing that and more ability<br/>\nto catch it and change my thinking. And it made our lives better when I was<br/>\nmore careful to ask, &quot;What do you think?&quot; or &quot;What do you like?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be wonderful when we really pay attention to each individual&#39;s<br/>\ninterests and try to create a family life that supports each particular<br/>\nchild. It might be that your children love eating dinner as a family and<br/>\nthat it is peaceful and rejuvenating and spiritually uplifting. If so,<br/>\nthat&#39;s awesome! But if it isn&#39;t so, then it very possibly might be that<br/>\nyour children do not share your interest in having that kind of meal time.<br/>\nTo really support their interests requires that you recognize them as<br/>\nseparate beings with separate tastes and preferences that are not only<br/>\ndifferent, but likely to, at times, be in conflict with yours. A really<br/>\ngood way to engage in the kind of self-analysis that it takes to do move<br/>\ntoward more respect and understanding, is to pay attention to the language<br/>\nwe use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, that is why I asked the questions I did about the use of &quot;we&quot; and<br/>\npointed out that the children are too young to even understand, much less<br/>\nwant, that particular kind of family dinner time. Also, it seemed that<br/>\nthrough their actions they were telling you that they don&#39;t want it so it<br/>\nseems discounting of their interests to say it is what &quot;we&quot; want.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamining and changing our speech can change our thinking and our behavior.<br/>\nAnd the dynamics in the family can really improve as a result. Even if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the way I&#39;ve expressed this, I hope you&#39;ll think about the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323128473","msgId":64128,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpiamtxcCtpMHE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiaXZrbSszOWFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64126,"nextInTopic":64129,"prevInTime":64127,"nextInTime":64129,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** That s an utterly unrealistic expectation to have of young children.

Often, with little kids, eating is something they do in passing - they&#39;ll pause and eat a few grapes here, a couple crackers there, and go back to what they&#39;re doing. Or they&#39;ll eat while transitioning from one thing to another. That&#39;s not a terrible thing! Little kids don&#39;t have all the same attachments adults do (yet) so they don&#39;t really need to pause and reflect the way adults do. They live much more in the moment than you do - that&#39;s something to admire and strive to learn from, if you like Buddhist ideas. Don&#39;t try to train them out of that - they&#39;ll Grow out of living in the moment as they get older, naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I try to encourage mindful eating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let them eat, instead. If you let them eat when they&#39;re hungry and stop when they&#39;re no longer interested, mindfulness will be easier for them where food is concerned because they won&#39;t have to fight off years of baggage around meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child who just wants and apple Right Now is being mindful of her real needs and desires. If she eats four bites and is done, she&#39;s still being mindful of her real needs and desires!

You can have plenty of food for the kids during the day, and make a nice dinner that you and your husband will enjoy without having to worry about accomodating kid-tastes. They can have another snack, or try what you&#39;re having, or sit and chat, or do an art project, or play with small toys at the table - or! not join you at all. The last sounds like the oposite of what you want, but over time I&#39;ve found that my kids Like to come and eat with me and my partner when we sit down together. They&#39;ll stop what they&#39;re doing and join us - not Every time, but when they do, its because they Want to be where we are, doing what we&#39;re doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, the kids eat an apple for dinner and then 30 minutes later eat pretzels or something as a &quot;snack&quot;.

Kids have tiny bellies and need to eat small amounts frequently, so have lots of little servings of foods that are easy to eat on hand. Do That instead of trying to get them to eat dinner, and you&#39;ll free up a bunch of energy right away. And you can make some nice grown-up thing for yourself or have your husband bring home a nice take-out meal now and again. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323121542","msgId":64124,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjMxMjE1NDIuNjA1OTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUxNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiajQ5citvMGpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc0NzMzQkJGLTQ5NzQtNEY3My05N0MwLTE1Qjc5QUQyMTA5QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGpiajQ5citvMGpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64121,"nextInTopic":64126,"prevInTime":64123,"nextInTime":64125,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I just feel that some routine and guidelines can help in that regard.

But this is apparently a very basic and broad argument against radical unschooling, that I am sure you have addressed a zillion times. I am not trying to live up to the label of unschooling or radical unschooling. Another core teaching of Buddhism, is that attachment leads to suffering.

Being attached to a set of guidelines does not seem like something that will necessarily help things go smoothly for a family. I suppose it could, depending on what the guidelines are, but using principles instead seems more pleasant for all involved, instead of being hung up on wanting things to be a certain way. Being attached to the idea of a quiet dinner with 3 young children in a home seems futile. <br/>\nThe most helpful unschooling advice I glean from lists/blogs/etc. is to just let go of the &#39;shoulds&#39; in my head, to detach myself from my own story enough that I can see what&#39;s happening with the other characters and interact with them in a way that is pleasant and meaningful for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can use all the &#39;guidelines&#39; we want, for sure. That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the best choice. It can be so frustrating being attached to an outcome (I cooked food, I expect it to be eaten by everyone), especially when we are disrespecting other people in order to fulfill our own &#39;need&#39;/desire for achieving that outcome. In trying to talk past the louder voices (such as children refusing to eat the food I want them to eat) our own voice won&#39;t be heard either, all there will be is a cacophony that is hurting everyone. I think that we adults need to learn to stop insisting that children hear us, and actually listen to what our children are trying to tell us. <br/>\n<br/>\nJenn<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another core teaching of Buddhism, is that attachment leads to suffering.

I picked it up to help me appreciate our family&#39;s interest in video games.  One of the things I learned from reading that book is that humans are *always* looking for fulfilling work for themselves.  The key is to make your work fulfilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done this at home in a variety of different ways.  I only use dishes that I have either made or really love.  That way, even cleaning them is a joy.  I have things loosely organized in baskets that I like to look at.  It takes me no time to throw things in their baskets if the house is getting a bit over-filled with our projects.  I gave in to our dining table being a works-in-progress table.  I put flowers in the middle of it all to celebrate the work!  We eat in various other places around the house.  For us, eating together has become more about connecting and talking about what we&#39;re working on, and less about having a traditional meal time.  We often play board games while we eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, most importantly, I have learned to celebrate the &quot;mess.&quot;  That meant I had to look at it very differently.  In less than 15 years Ethan will likely be out on his own.  The house (sadly, to me) will be all mine to make as neat or as organized as I want it to be, if that&#39;s what I want.  Right now, however, instead of seeing a mess, I choose to see creativity, learning and adventure.  I see fun and progress and connection.  I celebrate that we *can* live like this.  I find joy in my son&#39;s free explorations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast Winter, we did not have much snow yet.  Ethan loves snow.  We all do, really.  Ethan found the three hole punch, which hadn&#39;t been cleaned out in I don&#39;t know how long.  He opened it up...and found a treasure!  He looked over at me, smiled and then threw that collection of holes up into the air.  He danced and jumped around under the falling paper, singing about snow.  The kitchen was covered with little white circles.  Without hesitation, he crouched down and swept some up into his hands.  He threw them around again and again.  I left them for a while because they gave him so much joy.  By evening I decided to sweep them up.  When he saw me, he came and helped a bit, but even if he hadn&#39;t I would not have minded.  It was worth the ten minutes of sweeping to see the joy in his exploration.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to the forum with questions!","postDate":"1323109900","msgId":64111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMUE4RjlCLUY2ODEtNDJDMy05OEVGLUVBM0Y5NUQzNkNFREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpiaXN0OCt1Z2hpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpiaXN0OCt1Z2hpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64110,"nextInTopic":64112,"prevInTime":64110,"nextInTime":64112,"topicId":64095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- The youngest doesn t like riding in them anyway, unless we are moving constantly, like hiking or something.-=- Bouncing or swaying worked for us.

Now they are all in their 20&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestions to you:<br/>\n<br/>\nFind more &quot;big principles&quot; to hold onto, rather than specific rules and<br/>\nstructures. Finding ways to support your big principles will satisfy your<br/>\nown need for structure and planning.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you have a rule about family eating dinner together. That is<br/>\nbecause you are trying to support a bigger principle such as &quot;foster family<br/>\ncloseness.&quot; That&#39;s probably why you want to try to make everyone in the<br/>\nfamily sit down to eat dinner together, right? If you step back and think<br/>\nabout your real overriding principle of fostering family closeness, you&#39;ll<br/>\nrealize that dinner together is not only not the only way to adhere to your<br/>\noverriding principle and that forcing dinner together can even be<br/>\ncounterproductive to the big principle. If something isn&#39;t supporting the<br/>\nbig principle, drop it and find some other way to support that big<br/>\nprinciple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just one example of how thinking in terms of big principles, instead<br/>\nof specific rules, can help. Try applying that to food.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need &quot;crafts,&quot; by the way, if by that you mean a specific craft<br/>\nproject that involves following instructions, etc. My oldest daughter IS an<br/>\nartist and even makes some actual money selling her creations at boutiques<br/>\nthese days. She has always loved to have her hands busily creating art of<br/>\nall kinds. When she was 6 and I had a 4 year old and a 1 year old - we had<br/>\nart supplies outdoors really a lot. We had an easel and big sheets of paper<br/>\nand lots of tempera paint to play with outside. We made playdough<br/>\nfrequently - added all kinds of stuff to it such as oatmeal or pineapple<br/>\nflavoring. That was played with outdoors on the patio, too. They played<br/>\nwith fingerpaints in the bathtub (and sometimes fingerpainted with instant<br/>\npudding in the tub).  I bought really super good quality colored pencils<br/>\nand crayons and there was always a lot of paper of all kinds around.<br/>\nScissors and tape were available. The pencils, scissors, tape, and paper<br/>\nwere kept up all in a clear plastic box up just out of reach of the 1 yo.<br/>\nClean up meant dumping everything back into the big plastic box and putting<br/>\nit back up on a shelf.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, they don&#39;t need craft projects, but art supplies, yes. We had a card<br/>\ntable set up in a bedroom and they would take the art supplies box and go<br/>\nin there and shut the door and I&#39;d keep the 1 year old happy somewhere<br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake things interesting by adding things to the art supplies box over time.<br/>\nAdd a single hole puncher. Add some yarn. Add some old birthday cards or<br/>\nholiday cards. Popsicle sticks. Whatever you run into, add it. Just put<br/>\nthem in the box - you don&#39;t have to make up a project to do with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - what is the big principle here? Offer stimulating and interesting<br/>\nlearning activities, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you need to think more in terms of setting the stage for letting<br/>\nthem learn and less about yourself being in charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to go back to the family closeness thing and dinner. My family is<br/>\nreally very very close. My oldest daughter is 27 and married and she and<br/>\nher husband moved into a house that is a 1-minute walk from our front door.<br/>\nThey love living that close to us. My daughters are each others&#39; best<br/>\nfriends. We still do things as a family all the time - we all talk to each<br/>\nother every day. All that - and we had very few &quot;family dinners&quot; when the<br/>\nkids were growing up - those we had happened spontaneously or on special<br/>\noccasions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat counts for family closeness is shared experience. That&#39;s what that<br/>\nwhole family dinner is supposed to create. But difficult, uncomfortable,<br/>\nforced family dinners don&#39;t create closeness - they create a desire to get<br/>\naway/escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is much much better to have lots of small moments of joy and kindness!<br/>\nIt is all the small moments that build up over lifetimes to become real<br/>\nfamily closeness. Family dinner is intended to make sure there is time for<br/>\nloving family members to connect - that&#39;s it. Nothing else magical about<br/>\nit. But it is forced and artificial and unnatural to children to sit down<br/>\nfor a meal like that. Children would almost always rather &quot;graze&quot; on food<br/>\nthroughout the day and it is more healthy for them to do that. If you are<br/>\nworried about nutrition, forcing kids to sit at a dinner table and eat<br/>\ncertain foods (or refuse to eat them and have all that negativity) is a<br/>\nsure-fire way to contribute to them having problems with food later on.<br/>\n Better to put your effort into having nutritious snacks that they can eat<br/>\nwhen hungry. Make a list of very simple, good, healthy foods that you can<br/>\nthrow together. Make a list of dinners for you and your husband, too, that<br/>\nare super quick. Use only a few ingredients, not complicated recipes. For<br/>\nthese years, while you have little children, you and your husband can eat<br/>\nvery simply. Bread and soup is a good option, for example, that can be<br/>\ndelicious and nutritious and super quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig principle - supply kids with foods that will make them happy and<br/>\nhealthy.

And if I sound defensive, I&#39;m not trying to, I just need to figure this out :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout reading.......I am an avid reader of anything regarding natural learning or peaceful parenting.  I don&#39;t really know what else I could possibly read that would help me.  Maybe I should stop reading and asking questions and just try harder to figure stuff out for myself?  Again, I believe strongly in the ideas presented, just having difficulty applying them at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the arts and crafts, I just need to move my focus from the mess to what my children will gain from regular access to art supplies.  It will be difficult for me.  It&#39;s hard for someone who is naturally a very organized and minimalist type person. This, I see and probably already knew before I posted, is 100% my issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----&quot;But I don&#39;t think you really, deeply believe what you wrote, because it&#39;s a long idiomatic phrase people use without thinking.    &quot;I don&#39;t make more work for myself than I have to.&quot;  Mothers have said to other mothers for a long, long time &quot;Don&#39;t make more work for yourself than you have to&quot;----<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny.  I can&#39;t honestly remember a specific time I&#39;ve heard someone say that, but now that you mention it, it is pretty cliche.  But it is also how I truly feel.  I guess the raising multiple children/homeschooling/household management thing doesn&#39;t come as naturally to me as I&#39;d hoped it would and I&#39;m having a difficult time keeping up with all of my responsibilities.  But I feel so strongly about my children learning at home, I would never consider for a second anything else :)  I expect lots of challenges, and I know things won&#39;t be easy.  However, I get exhausted struggling with the same challenges every day and not finding anything that works for us to solve the issue.  I am a problem solver :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed reading your thoughts on these things.

It&#39;s really only dinner time I have issue with - taking the time/effort to cook and then my kids refusing to eat (it&#39;s usually &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot; as opposed to not being hungry). In theory, applying radical unschooling principles to food/eating/dinner sounds great, but in practice it just doesn&#39;t seem to work well for us. As far as &quot;rules&quot; go, I keep using them in quotes because they aren&#39;t rules in the sense that anybody is punished by not obeying them, it&#39;s just a set of ideals that we strongly encourage?  Yes the one year old enjoys being held, and that is that problem!  He always wants to be held or nursed.  WE&#39;ve never done great with carriers or the like.

I&#39;ve been a member of this group for a while, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted before.  I am trying to gain a different perspective/better insight into a few issues I&#39;m having at home. Hope that&#39;s okay for my first post!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, with regard to homeschooling, I keep going back and forth from completely free learning with my 6 year old, to needing/wanting seim-structured and planned lessons and activities, which I don&#39;t believe is inherently bad by the way.  The problem is that I have a very strong-willed 6 year old who is reluctant to do ANYTHING she doesn&#39;t feed is important or fun to her.  Which is understandable.  But on the other hand it is not feasible for me to only follow her spontaneous learning and always be able to come up with ideas for activities and such on a whim.  I also have a one year old and four year old. I stronly feel like I NEED to have at least a general idea of what we want to do during the week, with some planned/structured activities.  This takes planning of course, and then when all of my ideas (or even ideas we&#39;ve come up with together) are rejected I get very frustrated. I feel like I have two personalities - one that wants to be free and spontaneous in life and the other who really LOVES organization and planning and having purpose and direction in life.  I don&#39;t know how to reconcile the two?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, with arts and crafts, which my children love, as most children do I am sure, I find it difficult to get started on a project or even to get out supplies because I just keep thinking about the mess that&#39;s going to be left and the challenge I will have in finding time to clean it up.  My youngest is extremely needy and I have to do lots of things with him screaming and pulling on me, and I just try to make sure I don&#39;t make more work for myself than I have to.  I know that sounds awful and my kids are missing out, but......  We could do art when Daddy gets home I suppose, but that is the time the older ones get to play games and cards and do math manipulatives without the one year old grabbing and destroying everything.  I sometimes feels very guilty about having children so close together for these reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last major issue I can&#39;t find a solution to is dinner time.  Our &quot;rule&quot; at dinner is that we eat together as a family.  I&#39;ve explained to the kids why that&#39;s important to myself and my husband. And also that if they absolutely do not like what I cooked, they can choose to eat some fresh fruits, veggies, yogurt, or PB&J sandwich, but no other options.  Lately the older two kids, for whatever reason, have been refusing most dinners, even stuff they&#39;ve eaten and loved before.  The problems with this for us is that first of all, it is a miracle that I even get dinner made each night. It takes alot of effort with my clingly toddler, and I&#39;m tired of feeling like I&#39;m only cooking for my husband and me.  What&#39;s the point, really? Also, the kids eat an apple for dinner and then 30 minutes later eat pretzels or something as a &quot;snack&quot;.  So they end up eating an apple and pretzels for dinner?  I&#39;m big on good nutrition and I am having huge issues with this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I know my own views about things may be making these situations into &quot;issues&quot; when they don&#39;t need to be.  However, with several small children, I just don&#39;t see how our household can function without some &quot;rules&quot; and structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading.  ANY thoughts are greatly appreciated. I&#39;m tired of struggling for answers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64180,"nextTopicId":64096}}
