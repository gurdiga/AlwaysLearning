Even if you  <br/>\njust like graphics or page design and don&#39;t care about the content,  <br/>\nit&#39;s worth a look:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/\">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI loved this, from his resume:<br/>\n<br/>\n======================================================================== <br/>\n=============<br/>\nCurrent research<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther development of doctoral research in the light of theories of  <br/>\ncomplex adaptive systems<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer-aided and experiential learning<br/>\n<br/>\nUnintentional learning and hidden curriculum in FE/HE/professional  <br/>\ntraining<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of what he&#39;s writing about has to do with adult education, the  <br/>\nkind of training businesses do with/for/on their employees, and  <br/>\nthat.  I used one of his graphs on this page, which I don&#39;t think I  <br/>\nhad announced yet:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>\nand we corresponded about that and some other stuff, but it was (from  <br/>\nmy point of view) concerning a philosophy discussion series I&#39;m  <br/>\nhaving within the SCA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose of you who care about such things as models of learning,  <br/>\nthough, could find some cool things to think about, like this page  <br/>\nthat talks about different ways of learning, and one is a pretty  <br/>\nclear picture of the &quot;collect the dots&quot; stuff I&#39;ve talked about at  <br/>\nconferences.  You don&#39;t need to read the words; the graphs are clear:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/pask.htm#serialists\">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/pask.htm#serialists</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI like the way his pages have comment boxes and links along the side  <br/>\nas you learn.  I might try to learn that code trick.<br/>\nHere&#39;s something on learning curves and that second graph is really  <br/>\nhelpful to me, to see how something can be useful even if it&#39;s not  <br/>\nyet &quot;internalized&quot; (second nature).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/learning_curve.htm\">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/learning_curve.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27905,"nextTopicId":27819}}
