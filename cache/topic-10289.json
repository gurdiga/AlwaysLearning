What do we do <br/>\nthere...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe star trek experience.  It is really cool, if you are a trekie, or <br/>\nlike the show a great deal.  It&#39;s 26 bucks for a day pass, you can go as <br/>\nmany times as you like...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are buffets. My kids love them.  They are cheap and some are very <br/>\ngood.  Avoid Circus Circus, it&#39;s yucky.  Mandalay bay is really good, <br/>\nbut also very expensive.  If you go on weekdays, you can get a hotel for <br/>\n20 bucks and since food is cheap too, it&#39;s a deal.  Some of the hotels <br/>\nhave fun stuff for the kids.  Circus circus has some shows, the castle <br/>\none has some shows, one that Lexie loved which involved women dressed as <br/>\nprincesses and they sang songs and called kids up on stage to help sing. <br/>\n We were going every other week for a few months and lexie became a <br/>\nfavorite of them and was called up on stage each time we went, which was <br/>\n3-4x each weekend.  There are train shuttles between the casinos, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s fun for the kids and a couple of the casinos have amusement parks <br/>\nwith rollercoasters, etc.  Circus Circus has a nice indoor amusement <br/>\npark with shows and rides, most of which are good for kids ages 4-10 or <br/>\nso.  At least Lexie, at age 4, enjoyed them.  There is the m&m store, <br/>\nwhich we love, it has m&ms in all colors, including lots of different <br/>\npurples, pinks, black, white, etc.  Very cool, and expensive, but fun <br/>\ngifts.  Hoover Dam is close and the tour is worth it if you have kids <br/>\nages maybe 5 and older, we enjoyed it last time we went.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nspecatular dam and the history behind it and the men that died building <br/>\nit, etc. is facinating.  Laughlin is fun for a night, cheap room rates <br/>\n(on weekdays), the river boat tour is great there, bowling, and eating <br/>\nat buffets.  My kids absolutely love buffets and they have it down.  We <br/>\ngo at 1030ish, eat breakfast, hang out while they set up lunch and then <br/>\neat lunch and lunch deserts, all for the cheaper price of breakfast. <br/>\n Then we eat a late buffet dinner, like 7ish, and no other meals. <br/>\n Buffets run from $2-3 per young kid, to $5 for older kid, adults are <br/>\nfrom $6 for breakfast to $12 at the more expensive buffets, but we <br/>\ngenerally stick to the middle price ones, and usually spend less than <br/>\n$20 per meal.  We walk through the casino part of the hotels really <br/>\nquickly, and spend our time elsewhere.  December in vegas is very nice, <br/>\nthe nights are cool, the days are comfortable, and early december won&#39;t <br/>\nbe busy, especially on a weekday so you&#39;ll get good room rates, and <br/>\nincentives, like free breakfast buffets, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad is more than willing to talk to you and help you plan an <br/>\nitenerary.  He likes doing things like this.  so if you want his number...<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On 4 Nov 02, at 19:52, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dnowens@...\">Dnowens@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 11/4/02 3:14:19 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shyrley.williams@...\">shyrley.williams@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;re thinking of going to the GC the first week in December.

But here are the problems:  <br/>\nYou&#39;re leaving the class unattended.  Depending on the barometric changes and <br/>\nthe mood of the group, that might not be advisable.  Some classes were calm <br/>\nand collected, and that&#39;s when I&#39;d go.  A few had a kid who would NEVER pass <br/>\nup a chance to act out, and if I left someone else would be bugged, hit, <br/>\nirritated, have damage to his stuff, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if I went in the restroom and girls were in there ditching or smoking or <br/>\nwhatever, it wasn&#39;t really okay for me to do or say nothing.  I was always on <br/>\nduty, even if I just really wanted to sit in a quiet place for two minutes <br/>\nand take a crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you do all honestly know or remember doing yourself just saying <br/>\n&quot;bathroom&quot; in order to walk around, get into someone else&#39;s locker while <br/>\nthey&#39;re not there to defend it, or to peek in the window at your boyfriend?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t get into other lockers because I was lucky to remember the <br/>\ncombination to my own, but kids with good number memory could watch someone <br/>\nopen a locker and have it for the rest of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are true stories of teachers being insensitive about kids <br/>\nneeding the bathroom.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s all true.  My kids have no concept of the idea of not going when they <br/>\nneed to.    But some people who haven&#39;t taught might have no concept of the <br/>\nother side of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26367,"nextTopicId":26369}}
