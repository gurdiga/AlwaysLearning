I have a daughter that I can imagine being very similar in this regard, and I have two things to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is to set things up in a way that might help Megan with a framework for the dog search, such as, &quot;We are going to look at X amount of dogs before we choose one.&quot;  Or something like that, so that before you even look at the first one there is a deal in place to look at others.  She may still want the first one, but the fallback position is to wait and see the other dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is that she may just need to go through this process.  You can only do so much, and should do your part to support her and set things up to her best advantage, but then the rest is her life experience to get.  You can&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, imho, protect her from herself to the extent that she doesn&#39;t get to have these experiences.  Some people are more impulsive than others and will learn through life experiences how to manage those emotions.  We all have our own challenges to work out, and this may be a big one for Megan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see with my daughter that she is learning all the time how to come up with strategies to deal with that aspect of her nature.  If I tried to shield her from all disappointment she wouldn&#39;t have the perspective that she does.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Kids and pets","postDate":"1238801912","msgId":43702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0NDMyOUFBLTY4NjctNDUxOS05NTJDLUQxMkFERjgwQjVDNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyNW5nNitmamwxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdyNW5nNitmamwxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43698,"nextInTopic":43713,"prevInTime":43701,"nextInTime":43703,"topicId":43664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Someone who knows more about St. Bernard s might be better to speak up, but ... the snow - ...

One was sitting <br/>\noutside her front gate in Galveston all beat up just waiting for her to come <br/>\nout one morning. The shelter knew to call her when a doby came in which is <br/>\nhow she got her fourth as a pup (not all 4 at once). Eventually when Mom was <br/>\nvery ill, my dad found a lovely retired couple, former dog breeders with a <br/>\nranch, to take the old lady and still youngish male. The dogs are/were <br/>\nreally happy there. But from Mom&#39;s experience of what must be close to a <br/>\ndozen different dobies over the course of 30+ years, they are not a breed <br/>\nthat likes children. Just not, in general. Plus very territorial. Henry <br/>\nbelieved that Mom was alpha dog, but he was absolutely number 2 ahead of my <br/>\ndad, Chelsea (dog) and anyone else in the house! He had to be locked out <br/>\nwhen the maid came (she was terrified), and locked in when the pool guy came <br/>\n(he was terrified), just because he would bail anyone up against a wall <br/>\nuntil Mom (and only Mom) called him off. This was not a trained behavior; it <br/>\nwas his territorial personality. When we stayed there with Jayn the dogs <br/>\nwent into the Kennels.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoodles - standard and smaller - now they love children. They can be played <br/>\nwith and are very patient with little ones. My uncle had a standard for a <br/>\nlong time who was a dear and very cute when his hair was long. My friend&#39;s <br/>\ntoddler was once saved from falling over a cliff by their standard poodle <br/>\nwho continually placed himself between the baby and the edge, barking oddly <br/>\nuntil mom came running. They don&#39;t shed at all, and my friend also has a <br/>\nbunch of cats in the house with which the poodle got along fine. So a poodle <br/>\nor poodle mix might be a good choice for someone where there are concerns <br/>\nabout mess and relatively small spaces and other pets already.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who knows more about St. Bernard&#39;s might be better to speak up, but <br/>\nthey are a working dog - they were bred to rescue people lost in the snow - <br/>\nso perhaps the lying around personality is a bit of a movie myth?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She insisted on keeping them all indoors even though some<br/>\nof them really wanted out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky to have the history of my cat to help me provide better<br/>\ncare and know some of the things that she was struggling with.  I knew<br/>\nshe and my other cat might not end up being friends but took her in<br/>\nbecause I had more space and have had lots of experience with cats<br/>\nthrough the years.  Now that we have so much space and live in the<br/>\ncountry, my two cats are pretty happy and get along well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion when dealing with freecycle folks is to keep in contact<br/>\nif at all possible. If you haven&#39;t had a lot of experience with your<br/>\ntype of pet, then I personally don&#39;t recommend freecycle.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Kids and pets","postDate":"1238772114","msgId":43689,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyNTlpaSttbzk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYzMzgyMi44MzU1OC5xbUB3ZWI1MDQwMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43688,"nextInTopic":43690,"prevInTime":43688,"nextInTime":43690,"topicId":43664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t have any answers on how to help Megan to wait -- but I wanted to share our experience in owning dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst to say, we are CAT people, I am not a DOG person.  So, we started with one of those little hot-dog dogs, a miniature one (I can&#39;t remember their official name), but anyway, it was a pure-bred, and to me, seemed brain-dead.  He was hyper as he could be, and we had no success in training him.  After I&#39;d take him out to pee, or for a walk, he&#39;d come right back in and pee on the bed.  And by walk, I mean ME carrying him because he refused to walk!  We found him a nice new home.  At the time, my oldest was a toddler, and Penny, the dog, would jump up in his face and scratch him a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext we tried a lab mix from the shelter.  Mistake for us.  When I would go outside to feed him, he&#39;d flatten me on the ground, standing on me, licking my face (like Dino in Flintstone&#39;s!).  He was a very happy, well-meaning dog, just too, too hyper.  I took him to dog obedience school for a month, but to no avail.  We found him a nice new home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last try was Tasha.  She was a golden retriever/chow mix.  Another big mistake.  That dog never stopped barking.  She was very sweet and very hyper also.  My niece took her for us after we had Tasha about a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF we try a dog again, we want to get a big, lazy dog, like a St. Bernard.  I&#39;ve read that even though they&#39;re huge, they don&#39;t eat as much as a hyper dog, like a lab, because they&#39;re so sedate.  They just lay around and look cute, and let the children lay on them.  That&#39;s my kind of dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know what kind you end up getting.  I&#39;d be interested to hear about it.

And with a toddler<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in the home, biting is a real possibility.  Toddlers explore.  They<br/>\npoke eyes and pull ears and tails and hug tightly and don&#39;t<br/>\nrealize that this is hurting the dog.  They are just exploring!<br/>\nStill, it is very natural for the dog to react by biting the child.  <br/>\nThis does not mean that the dog is vicious, but it can&#39;t stay, <br/>\n&quot;Please stop!&quot; or &quot;Ouch, that hurts!&quot;  The dog can&#39;t push curious<br/>\nhands away.  The dog has a growl, which a toddler may well <br/>\nnot understand means, &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;  And the dog has teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the dog has bitten, finding it a home becomes more difficult. <br/>\nIt gets labeled &quot;vicious dog.&quot;  I&#39;m speaking from experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while some adults may find giving the dog away easy,<br/>\nI think many children would find it a great disappointment<br/>\nto have to give up their dog.  As the op is very concerned<br/>\nabout her DDs sense of disappointment, that is a real<br/>\nconcern that merits more consideration... IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Our society says that dogs are disposable things,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe your society does. I don&#39;t know anybody who would say that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I meant &quot;American mainstream society&quot; which is not &quot;our <br/>\nsociety&quot; on this list.

Our family, too, has successfully combined toddlers and<br/>\ndogs.  And those dogs weren&#39;t calm; they were Border Collies!  I am not saying,<br/>\n &quot;Don&#39;t do this!&quot;  I *am* saying, &quot;Don&#39;t rush into this.&quot;  Megan is in a big hurry, <br/>\nbut mother should set the pace in this case.  She may very well be doing<br/>\nexactly that, but if so, that didn&#39;t come through clearly in the original<br/>\npost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve given op one idea on how to help Megan deal with disappointment:<br/>\nshow her fewer dogs.  So that is one thing she can do.  And what else?<br/>\nWould spending time with other people&#39;s dogs... dogs that have families...<br/>\nwhere it is clear that Megan is just visiting, not looking for a dog of<br/>\nher own to keep... would that help Megan during the wait for the perfect<br/>\ndog?  If she wanted to, and the dog&#39;s owners were willing, Megan could<br/>\nplay with the dogs, pat them, maybe help groom them, maybe help<br/>\nfeed them, maybe walk them.  Is there a dog in the neighborhood she <br/>\ncould befriend? Or a local dog park she could visit, one that allows kids <br/>\nunder 8 to come in?  (Some don&#39;t for the same reasons that many agencies<br/>\nwon&#39;t adopt dogs out to families with kids under 8.)<br/>\nThat would give her some opportunity to experience the joys<br/>\nof being around dogs, and if there was a very clear understanding that<br/>\nthese dogs are for making friends with, not for bringing into our own<br/>\nfamily, could Megan enjoy something like that?  It would also give her<br/>\nmore opportunities to spend time with dogs, and then go home without<br/>\nthe dogs.  That could be good or bad for Megan.  Her mom would be<br/>\nthe best judge of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about reading dog books?  I read a book at Christmastime, _A Dog<br/>\nNamed Christmas_ by Greg Kincaid.  Kinda saccharine for my taste,<br/>\nbut, still heartwarming, and on-topic.  It&#39;s about a Vietnam vet who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to commit to bringing another dog into the family,<br/>\nafter the painful loss of two dogs, and his conflict with an adult son<br/>\n(20 yo son, with Down Syndrome, who wants very much to have a dog.)<br/>\nI wonder if Megan would enjoy having her mother read this story to<br/>\nher?  My 8 yo&#39;s wouldn&#39;t find the war references and the father&#39;s sadness<br/>\ntoo heavy... but mine are not Megan!  The book has a lot of good<br/>\nmessages about relationships and overcoming grief and taking a chance,<br/>\neven when it feels uncomfortable, on saying &quot;yes.&quot;  It presents the young<br/>\nman in a positive light, too; he is the real hero of the story and the father<br/>\nis really focused on all the wonderful things that the young man can do,<br/>\nrather than being focused on his &quot;disability.&quot;  And, of course, the young<br/>\nman does convince his father (and many others in their community) to get<br/>\na dog, and all works out happily. So, that might be a good read, if Megan <br/>\nlikes being read to, or perhaps others could suggest books with a similar <br/>\ntheme:  child wants dog and is disappointed at having to wait to see that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Some more thoughts on books... if books will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n_The Stray Dog_ is a nice picture book, (and a true story!), about a family<br/>\nthat finds the perfect dog when they aren&#39;t looking for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n_A Dog on Barkham Street_ is about two boys, one boy who loses his dog<br/>\nbecause his parents expect him to take care of it, and he doesn&#39;t, &#39;cause he&#39;s <br/>\njust a kid and not ready for that responsibility, and one boy who gains a dog<br/>\nbut loses an uncle.
