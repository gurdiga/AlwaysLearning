The problem I have (and a couple of others in the group have) with <br/>\nthe set up of the group, is that we (the adults) sit in the lounge room and <br/>\ndiscuss stuff while the kids go off and play. The kids may be inside, they <br/>\nmay be out. Mostly we can&#39;t see them (unless they are directly out the front <br/>\nwindow). I have issues with this as, although, it mostly &#39;appears&#39; to be <br/>\nworking well, there have been (obviously) little incidences arise where the <br/>\nchildren need help in coping etc. I&#39;ve always been such a hands on parent <br/>\nand have found myself just going along with the group set up as is for the <br/>\nsake of the others in the group. We have now raised the issue and others in <br/>\nthe group don&#39;t see it as a problem and believe that the kids will come in <br/>\nand tell their parents if there&#39;s a problem. This simply isn&#39;t the case <br/>\nthough (the parents are just not aware of it). The children involved are <br/>\nusually: a 6 yr old boy, 7 yr old girl, 2, 4 yr old girls and a 12 yr old <br/>\ngirl. Sometimes more than this comes and the dynamics are usually more <br/>\nheightened, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I would love you guys to help me with is - 1) am I being over <br/>\nthe top with my protectiveness etc (my heart says no I&#39;m not) and 2) we are <br/>\nthinking of starting up another similar group for people who can&#39;t travel <br/>\nthe distance to the present group, so I&#39;d really love some ideas as to how <br/>\nwe could still have abit of a discussion group while the chilren are being <br/>\nbetter helped/supervised. Normally, discussion type groups I go to are at <br/>\nnight when my husband is home with Lewi, but there&#39;s no option for this at <br/>\nthe moment due to distances at night that would have to be travelled by many <br/>\nmembers of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210653085,"authorName":"Kim H","from":"&quot;Kim H&quot; &lt;kimlewismark@...&gt;","profile":"kimhoussenloge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: suggestions needed re: our unschooling group","postDate":"1146296425","msgId":25639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMzIwMWM2NmI2MCQyZGFlMmRlMCRiMDIzZWNkY0BraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4=","referencesHeader":"PGUydWRpOCtqZmtpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25636,"nextInTopic":25773,"prevInTime":25638,"nextInTime":25640,"topicId":25622,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1519070155\">&lt;think the key <br/>\nis that the room is small enough that you don&#39;t have to keep getting <br/>\nup and following your child around (like in a park)...is there any <br/>\nkind of community center or library around that might lend you a room <br/>\nfor a couple of hours a week?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Katherine.

The room is small enough that the moms can sit at a table <br/>\n  talking but still hear and see the kids play. Of course, being inside <br/>\n  and in a library, there  were some restrictions as to what the kids <br/>\n  could play (therefore if there were more than about six kids there it <br/>\n  got stressful, because the noise level really increased)...mostly we <br/>\n  encouraged card playing (like pokemon), board games, <br/>\n  blocks/lego/lincoln logs etc....I havent found it difficult <br/>\n  to &quot;discuss&quot; with the other moms in this atmosphere.

The problem I have (and a couple of others in the group have) with the set up of the group, is that we (the adults) sit in the lounge room and discuss stuff while the kids go off and play. The kids may be inside, they may be out. Mostly we can&#39;t see them (unless they are directly out the front window). I have issues with this as, although, it mostly &#39;appears&#39; to be working well, there have been (obviously) little incidences arise where the children need help in coping etc. I&#39;ve always been such a hands on parent and have found myself just going along with the group set up as is for the sake of the others in the group. We have now raised the issue and others in the group don&#39;t see it as a problem and believe that the kids will come in and tell their parents if there&#39;s a problem. This simply isn&#39;t the case though (the parents are just not aware of it). The children involved are usually: a 6 yr old boy, 7 yr old girl, 2, 4 yr old girls and a 12 yr old girl. Sometimes more than this comes and the dynamics are usually more heightened, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I would love you guys to help me with is - 1) am I being over the top with my protectiveness etc (my heart says no I&#39;m not) and 2) we are thinking of starting up another similar group for people who can&#39;t travel the distance to the present group, so I&#39;d really love some ideas as to how we could still have abit of a discussion group while the chilren are being better helped/supervised. Normally, discussion type groups I go to are at night when my husband is home with Lewi, but there&#39;s no option for this at the moment due to distances at night that would have to be travelled by many members of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25765,"nextTopicId":25591}}
