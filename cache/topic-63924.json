Especially the full cast kind.  The Golden<br/>\nCompass was wonderful and engaging.  We all loved Junie B Jones, Cactus<br/>\nKapoor and the list goes on.  And of course lots of music that your son<br/>\nlikes.  There are lots of things available that can be downloaded for cheap<br/>\nor free from the net.  We also played road games like I Spy and counting<br/>\nlicense plates.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son particularly liked to know where we were going and to be able to see<br/>\na map.  We bought an atlas from Walmart that lists all of the Walmarts for<br/>\nvarious areas.  This could be handy because they seem to allow camper<br/>\nparking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have a camper, just a regular van, so we made a stop every few<br/>\nhours.  You might be able to plan your exercise stops so that you can see a<br/>\npretty overlook or something.  I am sure that there are multiple van travel<br/>\nwebsites that has other tips or even lists of sites to see that you and<br/>\nyour son can pick through.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Nov 27, 2011 at 3:50 PM, nicolaphillips88 &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nicolaphillips88@...\">nicolaphillips88@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello All,<br/>\n&gt; I have one son(4yrs) who is &#39;unschooled&#39; and will continue to be. ..<br/>\n&gt; i have just bought a campervan :-) thinking /planning on living in it for<br/>\n&gt; spring/summer.<br/>\n&gt; does anyone have any advice tips for an &#39;on the road&#39; life with a child? ?<br/>\n&gt; x thankyou in advance, Nicola x<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":437833022,"authorName":"nicolaphillips88","from":"&quot;nicolaphillips88&quot; &lt;nicolaphillips88@...&gt;","profile":"nicolaphillips88","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"does any one live on the road ?","postDate":"1322427007","msgId":63924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGphdTdwdisxMDR1dUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63930,"prevInTime":63923,"nextInTime":63925,"topicId":63924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All, I have one son(4yrs) who is unschooled and will continue to be. .. i have just bought a campervan :-) thinking /planning on living in it for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-476413308\">Hello All, <br/>\nI have one son(4yrs) who is &#39;unschooled&#39; and will continue to be. ..<br/>\ni have just bought a campervan :-) thinking /planning on living in it for  spring/summer. <br/>\ndoes anyone have any advice tips for an &#39;on the road&#39; life with a child? ? x thankyou in advance, Nicola x</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63917,"nextTopicId":63950}}
