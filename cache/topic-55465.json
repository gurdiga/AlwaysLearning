I had played with  <br/>\nsetting it to different accents in English (and being a little miffed  <br/>\nthat &quot;UK&quot; and &quot;American&quot; aren&#39;t further differentiated into regions),  <br/>\nbut I went back and found it will do German, too!  With seven  <br/>\ndifferent voices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not conversation, but it can pronounce words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php?sitepal\">http://www.oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php?sitepal</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPretty fun.  There are 26 languages there.<br/>\nThere are interesting &quot;misfires,&quot; and it&#39;s fun to wonder why.
