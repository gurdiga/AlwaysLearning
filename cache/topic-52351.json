I&#39;m sorry I missed the chat!  We had a busy and scary day yesterday and we were all tired and I woke at night to check on Chamille because she was sick, so I slept in over my alarm!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that to be so true though... our own perspective changes everything!  We know some kids whose parents see them as bad children that misbehave, and treat their kids within that framework.  I see my children as good and wonderful people, so everything is within that framework.  Then extending that into everything including their &quot;education&quot;, they are smart thinking people who absorb the whole big world that&#39;s around them.  I find my kids to be interesting people and I bring them interesting things to explore and help them explore the interesting things they find.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a long chat with my dad last night about the color blue.  Only with my dad... the conversation went through history, language, art, various artists and all the different ways in which the color blue has been used and manufactured through time.  It reminded me that Chamille and I had a recent discussion of art in which Vermeer was brought up, he used the color blue in really specific ways.  Chamille, without ever having a lesson in art or art history or art critique, discussed what she saw in Vermeer&#39;s art.  That day, we had out a couple of different art books representing Vermeer, Van Gogh, Norman Rockwell, Monet, and Hopper, a sort of hodgepodge collection, but I was researching something and had those books out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the deal about that and how that relates to the chat... These books are always on my bookshelf accessible, but my kids won&#39;t go over and look at stuff on the book shelf, BUT if I&#39;m pulling stuff out, then I invite my kids into my world, knowing that they are interesting and interested people.  I didn&#39;t have to pull out art books, I could&#39;ve gone into the kitchen and done my dishes, but there was something I was interested in.  I have tons of things in my house that I can pull out and share with my kids, and I do, but I don&#39;t wait for them to be interested in it first because they won&#39;t be.  It&#39;s like how the smell of chocolate chip cookies sort of draw people into the kitchen to see what smells so good!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"best quote from the chat today","postDate":"1269629498","msgId":52351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDMkJENzFBLUJENTQtNDE2NS1BMEYxLTVDNzM0NENDM0UzQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52356,"prevInTime":52350,"nextInTime":52352,"topicId":52351,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Unschooling is all about how parents are seeing their kids. --Jill Parmer That s another good entryway to understanding unschooling.
