My son does not like to go out (the hustle and bustle overwhelms and irritates him). Here are physical things we do inside every day:<br/>\n<br/>\n-we constantly play/roll on/bounce on our huge exercise ball<br/>\n-jump rope . We have an ongoing contest for how many jumps we can do without messing up<br/>\n-play Dance Dance Revolution<br/>\n-bounce on hippety hops (Ours is bug enough for me to ride on)<br/>\n-Dance to music. Everything from hip-hop to tango<br/>\n-We have a game that involves trying to knock each other over with pillows on the queen-size bed<br/>\n-setting up &quot;Wipe-Out&quot; style obstacle courses on the furniture (putting slip covers on things helps me to chill out about damage)<br/>\n-play &quot;Bop-it Bounce&quot; ball game: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-20163-Bop-It-Bounce/dp/B0036RIMNQ\">http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-20163-Bop-It-Bounce/dp/B0036RIMNQ</a><br/>\n-juggle<br/>\n-many many improvised games with our dog involving stuffed animals, balls, treats, etc.<br/>\n-a ping-pong set that we set up on our dining room table. We use pennies to keep score and play real sets. A few weeks ago we had a friend over and played for the &quot;championship.&quot; Cheap and still a favorite after years! You can get it for about $10: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.coolstuffexpress.com/table-top-ping-pong-set.html?feed=Froogle\">http://www.coolstuffexpress.com/table-top-ping-pong-set.html?feed=Froogle</a><br/>\n-inflatable swords and socker boppers<br/>\n-sit-and-spin<br/>\n-trying to keep a ballon from touching the floor can be incredibly entertaining and active, especially for little kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-a small indoor trampoline. They come with or without a handlebar.<br/>\n-basketball with an over the door hoop and soft, spongy balls<br/>\n-a few years ago I bought a bunch of upholstery foam remnants super cheap from a furniture repair place. We used them to build all kinds of things you could jump and fall and climb on. We stored them under the bed.<br/>\n-until recently, we&#39;ve always had an indoor swing. This is the model and it&#39;s very easy to install in a doorway: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rainy-Day-Indoor-Piece-Combo/dp/B000W0A1NE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_t_1\">http://www.amazon.com/Rainy-Day-Indoor-Piece-Combo/dp/B000W0A1NE/ref=pd_sim_sbs_t_1</a><br/>\nIt&#39;s a little pricey, but we&#39;ve used ours for over a decade (my eldest is 21).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do all of this and more, alone or with friends. On a bigger scale, I have scrimped and saved all year to be able to leave the city for the summer and stay at a cabin on a lake so my son can spend his days in the country swimming, which is something he loves. There are lots of solutions, big and small, for helping kids get physical needs met. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your son doesn&#39;t really enjoy crowds of other kids or playing at the park. Mine doesn&#39;t either and forcing him into those situation was harmful to him and to our relationship.

I bought a set of placemats at a thrift store<br/>\n- plastic ones. I got several sets. We ended up writing numbers on them and<br/>\nthe kids would lay them out in the living room and play hopscotch on them<br/>\n(and use them as part of their obstacle courses).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso play &quot;sharks&quot; or &quot;lava&quot; - put old placemats or sheets of newspaper or<br/>\nanything else - all over the room, just far enough apart that it is a<br/>\nchallenge to go from one to the other and then hop around pretending that<br/>\nif you step off either the sharks will get you or you&#39;ll be in hot lava.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose big cardboard brick building blocks (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Giant-Building-Block-40-piece-Set/dp/B00005ICC4)\">http://www.amazon.com/Giant-Building-Block-40-piece-Set/dp/B00005ICC4)</a><br/>\n Combine these with small tables and chairs and cushions and more - to<br/>\nbuild BIG structures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrag home large appliance boxes if you see them - kids can find all kinds<br/>\nof ways to play with them and they encourage large muscle play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose little parachute guys that he can climb up high and drop (or look<br/>\nonline you can make these easily).<br/>\n<br/>\nPut up a short step ladder in the middle of the living room - play pretend<br/>\nwith it. Drop parachutes off it. Every time he climbs up and down - that&#39;s<br/>\ngood!<br/>\n<br/>\nJump ropes - play &quot;snakes&quot; by wiggling it as you move around the room and<br/>\nhe tries to stomp it. Make up more games with ropes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake &quot;obstacle courses&quot; throughout the apartment - put couch cushions and<br/>\npieces of newspaper and other things (a mini trampoline in there somewhere)<br/>\nand things to crawl over and crawl under (coffee tables, chairs) and get a<br/>\nstopwatch to time it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDance - put on happy high-energy music and dance around the apartment. My<br/>\nkids liked scarves - long flowing scarves to wave around while they danced.<br/>\nThere are really cheap little paper thingies that sort of unwind and you<br/>\nwave them around in patters while you dance - like gymnasts use.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunching bags! Those bouncy balls kids can sit on and bounce around. I know<br/>\nI know - doesn&#39;t seem safe for indoors - MAKE it safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake it a priority - spend at hours every single day outdoors where he can<br/>\nrun and play. Play WITH him if he&#39;s not finding other kids to play with. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re having fun together, why would he be sitting and crying. Take bubble<br/>\nstuff and weird bubble wands that you make out of pipe cleaners. Do the<br/>\nmentos experiment. Get those cheap little balsa wood gliders and fly those<br/>\n(and chase them). Make a little scooter ramp to take to the park. Make life<br/>\noutdoors fun and run around with him and climb up on the playground<br/>\nequipment with him and slide down the slide and haul water for him so he<br/>\ncan build castles with moats in the sandbox.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat he has trouble sharing isn&#39;t a reason to not take him out. Be there to<br/>\nhelp. Think ahead - take something that he is willing to share or don&#39;t<br/>\ntake toys at all. Most kids on playgrounds don&#39;t bring their own toys -<br/>\nmostly they play on the playground equipment. Second - you don&#39;t have to go<br/>\nto playgrounds - go to parts of parks where there are trees and bushes to<br/>\nrun around in, too. Take a ball and play with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying in the bathtub is really good - being immersed in water is an<br/>\nextraordinary calming and physically nurturing thing. Bathtub play was kind<br/>\nof a lifesaver for me with my extremely high-energy and intense kid! I&#39;d<br/>\nput all kinds of things in the tub - egg beaters, cups and bowls, measuring<br/>\ncups, basters, and so on. An empty tub and a big huge bowl of instant<br/>\npudding was great - they played and played with it - and it washed right<br/>\naway. Bubble baths - of course - but be creative with them (add flavorings<br/>\nlike pineapple or chocolate to the water, for example). Baths were really a<br/>\nfocal point of our days during winter months. (Put towels on the floor and<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry about it getting wet.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very sad when a child is diagnosed as having ADD or hyperactivity or<br/>\nwhatever - but the kid is a rambunctious little one who is mostly being<br/>\nkept indoors in an apartment and not getting hours of strenuous big-body<br/>\nplay time every day - then the poor kid gets drugged and treated and talked<br/>\nabout as if there is something wrong with him! Instead of considering him<br/>\nas disabled in some way and trying to treat it - consider him as an<br/>\nextremely rambunctious kiddo who needs a tremendous amount of physical<br/>\nactivity. Make it your goal and your priority that he is physically worn<br/>\nout at the end of every single day. End the day with long playtime in the<br/>\nbathtub.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus your own energy on being super creative about fun things to do<br/>\ntogether that involve large-muscle activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jun 14, 2012 at 7:48 AM, Laura Selecman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:poptartcutie@...\">poptartcutie@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So in staying home with them.

We ran<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and jumped and tumbled and skated and biked and climbed and dug and chased<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and roughhoused like crazy. I also spent many hours in water almost every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;single day during the summer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On school days I walked/ran to and from school, had at least two recesses<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class physical education time (we played games like Capture the Flag,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dodgeball, and Red Rover Red Rover) and a lunch break (I ran home for<br/>\n&gt; lunch<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and back quickly to spend time playing on the playground), and we had NO<br/>\n&gt; &gt;homework so the minute I got home from school I changed into pants/shorts<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because girls had to wear dresses to school in those days and ran back<br/>\n&gt; &gt;outside to play with neighborhood kids. Play consisted very largely of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hide-and-seek, kick-the-can, stickball, kickball, a wide variety of tag<br/>\n&gt; &gt;games, mother-may-I, lemonade, red light green light, duck duck goose, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a TON of hopscotch. I roller skated and rode my bike and we had<br/>\n&gt; rudimentary<br/>\n&gt; &gt;skateboards (we took apart our skates and nailed them to boards). We had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pogo sticks and slip-n-slides and hula hoops. We often went over to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;school playground and played on the equipment - rings, slides, swings. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt;played foursquare a lot. My neighbor had a trampoline and we bounced and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bounced and bounced.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Nearly every evening of my childhood I was physically worn out - very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;grubby and tired and ready to have some dinner, a bath, watch a little tv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have some stories or have mom or dad sing to us kids, maybe play with my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sisters with dolls or something for a little while and often fall asleep<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reading a book.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And &quot;I&quot; was a fairly sedentary kid compared to many! I was a bookworm kid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who loved board and card games.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Children haven&#39;t changed - their physical needs haven&#39;t changed - since<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;50&#39;s or 60&#39;s. Some kids need more and others need less physical activity,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but when a parent thinks a kid is &quot;hyper&quot; or &quot;bounces off the walls&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;complains about a kid&#39;s aggressive behaviors and so on - the parent<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably has no idea the sheer quantity of physically strenuous activity<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that that child needs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;People these days will say, &quot;He&#39;s got soccer 3 days a week,&quot; as if that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;supposed to give him enough opportunity for physical activity. First, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;love soccer for many kids, but it is a structured-by-adults activity in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which a child has to control his physical urges for much of the time. He<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has to wait, stand in line, use the part of his body he is supposed to<br/>\n&gt; use.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It is not at all the same as structured-by-the-kids-themselves play. And,<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;few hours a week is completely inadequate for most kids as an energy burn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off. They more likely need a few hours every day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes, kids are different. Not all kids want or need a lot of physical<br/>\n&gt; &gt;activity. Some will climb a tree and sit up on a branch and read a book<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hours - not hang and swing and jump and balance. But ONLY the child can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really know how much physical activity he or she needs and the child can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only figure that out in the context of having plentiful free and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unstructured time for it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Boys, on the average, need even greater amounts of strenuous physical<br/>\n&gt; &gt;activity than girls. That they tend to be more aggressive has to do with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hormones they experience even in the womb. Again - there is a big range<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some girls have greater physical needs than some boys and vice versa - but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;moms seem to very often have a hard time with how physical their little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;boys are. The same can be true for moms of girls who happen to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;extremely high physical energy needs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sometimes dads help the moms understand their boys&#39; physical needs, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when dads are busy working all day and it is mom who is home with the<br/>\n&gt; kids,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;boys can end up being very much not getting their needs met and moms end<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thinking there is something wrong with their little boys.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course all of this is made much worse by school, where all kids are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;expected to sit still much of the time. But homeschooling moms can have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unrealistic expectations, too. And I think many of their sons suffer for<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(and some of their daughters, too).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-pam<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] kids and physical needs","postDate":"1339688523","msgId":67655,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0REMxMkU0LUExOTEtNDAzQi05ODJELUI1N0MzN0ZFNUREREBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzk2ODUzMzEuNDk2MTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg0NTA4Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzk2NDgzODguNDQxMTkuYW5kcm9pZE1vYmlsZUB3ZWI4NDUwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxDQU9PVGFYTytkMlhTYzVKbzFBNTRFZjRRYThqcTY4R3hNY2NhUmZnZ1o0SHotaFhQNlFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMzM5Njg1MzMxLjQ5NjE2LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4NDUwOC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67654,"nextInTopic":67656,"prevInTime":67654,"nextInTime":67656,"topicId":67644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was a bookworm kid<br/>\n&gt;who loved board and card games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Children haven&#39;t changed - their physical needs haven&#39;t changed - since the<br/>\n&gt;50&#39;s or 60&#39;s. Some kids need more and others need less physical activity,<br/>\n&gt;but when a parent thinks a kid is &quot;hyper&quot; or &quot;bounces off the walls&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;complains about a kid&#39;s aggressive behaviors and so on -  the parent<br/>\n&gt;probably has no idea the sheer quantity of physically strenuous activity<br/>\n&gt;that that child needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;People these days will say, &quot;He&#39;s got soccer 3 days a week,&quot; as if that is<br/>\n&gt;supposed to give him enough opportunity for physical activity. First, I<br/>\n&gt;love soccer for many kids, but it is a structured-by-adults activity in<br/>\n&gt;which a child has to control his physical urges for much of the time. He<br/>\n&gt;has to wait, stand in line, use the part of his body he is supposed to use.<br/>\n&gt;It is not at all the same as structured-by-the-kids-themselves play. And, a<br/>\n&gt;few hours a week is completely inadequate for most kids as an energy burn<br/>\n&gt;off. They more likely need a few hours every day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, kids are different. Not all kids want or need a lot of physical<br/>\n&gt;activity. Some will climb a tree and sit up on a branch and read a book for<br/>\n&gt;hours - not hang and swing and jump and balance. But ONLY the child can<br/>\n&gt;really know how much physical activity he or she needs and the child can<br/>\n&gt;only figure that out in the context of having plentiful free and<br/>\n&gt;unstructured time for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Boys, on the average, need even greater amounts of strenuous physical<br/>\n&gt;activity than girls. That they tend to be more aggressive has to do with<br/>\n&gt;hormones they experience even in the womb. Again - there is a big range and<br/>\n&gt;some girls have greater physical needs than some boys and vice versa - but<br/>\n&gt;moms seem to very often have a hard time with how physical their little<br/>\n&gt;boys are. The same can be true for moms of girls who happen to have<br/>\n&gt;extremely high physical energy needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes dads help the moms understand their boys&#39; physical needs, but<br/>\n&gt;when dads are busy working all day and it is mom who is home with the kids,<br/>\n&gt;boys can end up being very much not getting their needs met and moms end up<br/>\n&gt;thinking there is something wrong with their little boys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course all of this is made much worse by school, where all kids are<br/>\n&gt;expected to sit still much of the time. But homeschooling moms can have<br/>\n&gt;unrealistic expectations, too. And I think many of their sons suffer for it<br/>\n&gt;(and some of their daughters, too).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;             <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] kids and physical needs","postDate":"1339612730","msgId":67645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGRDYyNDRELTdENkUtNDU2NC04QzE4LUMxQ0M2N0NBNjVDMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQUDBKcy0ycUZ2YkRNc2d3VWpBdVRHTnVyZ3VCRUt5djZCanBReHhUOWIxUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQUDBKcy0ycUZ2YkRNc2d3VWpBdVRHTnVyZ3VCRUt5djZCanBReHhUOWIxUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67644,"nextInTopic":67653,"prevInTime":67644,"nextInTime":67646,"topicId":67644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like what Pam wrote.

We ran<br/>\nand jumped and tumbled and skated and biked and climbed and dug and chased<br/>\nand roughhoused like crazy. I also spent many hours in water almost every<br/>\nsingle day during the summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn school days I walked/ran to and from school, had at least two recesses a<br/>\nclass physical education time (we played games like Capture the Flag,<br/>\ndodgeball, and Red Rover Red Rover) and a lunch break (I ran home for lunch<br/>\nand back quickly to spend time playing on the playground), and we had NO<br/>\nhomework so the minute I got home from school I changed into pants/shorts<br/>\nbecause girls had to wear dresses to school in those days and ran back<br/>\noutside to play with neighborhood kids. Play consisted very largely of<br/>\nhide-and-seek, kick-the-can, stickball, kickball, a wide variety of tag<br/>\ngames, mother-may-I, lemonade, red light green light, duck duck goose, and<br/>\na TON of hopscotch. I roller skated and rode my bike and we had rudimentary<br/>\nskateboards (we took apart our skates and nailed them to boards). We had<br/>\npogo sticks and slip-n-slides and hula hoops.
