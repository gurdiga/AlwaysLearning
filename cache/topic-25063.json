Over here in Australia the legal age is 18 - I really feel like 21 pushes the limit. I can&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so old in the US. Under age drinking is a huge problem over here too. I tend to think that a lot of these problems stem from disconnectedness (spelling??) within families. Teens feel the need to rebel against rules, groundings, punishments etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel, like you Patti, that when/if Lewi shows an interest in alcohol them it&#39;ll certainly be something we discuss openly and with much understanding. I think at 15 or 16, if kids want to share in wine or beer (the moderation thing) then surely it&#39;s a way of them learning about alcohol and taking away the focus of binge drinking. I guess it&#39;s a bit like the TV, the less restrictions the less desire (for some at least). <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, it&#39;s certainly got me thinking anyway. I can&#39;t wait to hear what others have to say about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: averyschmidt <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 10, 2006 3:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Kids and Alcohol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m interested in what you all think about alcohol in general and <br/>\n  kids and alcohol in particular.
