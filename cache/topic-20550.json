We lose so much when we take away the tone of voice and inflections.  It&#39;s not surprising that sometimes people are misunderstood.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne that comes to mind for me, is that if we are in a hurry, we often read fast.  And so the sentences we read come off of the page fast.  But critical comments that are SAID fast can sound really harsh.  Most of us, when offering criticism to a real-life friend might speak slowly, or haltingly, and watch to see how the recipient was responding.  When we offer criticism on the list, we might type it slowly, or hesitatingly, but we have no control of how &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;loud&quot; it sounds when other people read it.  The reader has to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; without enough information to really guess someone&#39;s intended tone.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s good to lean in the direction of assuming the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160772665,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;contact@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning]","postDate":"1093628546","msgId":20554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBBRUlKS0hPQkFIRkNERElJS09JT0VIQ0NKQUEuY29udGFjdEBib2FyZHByZXAubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBBRUlKS0hPQkFIRkNERElJS09JRUVIQ0NKQUEuY29udGFjdEBib2FyZHByZXAubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":20552,"nextInTopic":20555,"prevInTime":20553,"nextInTime":20555,"topicId":20550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Andrew very much wanted to go to an art high school this year that he had picked out before his surgery.
