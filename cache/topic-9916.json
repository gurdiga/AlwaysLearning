They needed to find some friends <br/>\nin the area so we decided to give it a go. I didn&#39;t expect that it would be <br/>\nfor us but we love it so far. Two reasons that we were avoiding the cult :~) <br/>\nwas that we believed it was too Christian for us and that I&#39;d heard somewhere <br/>\nthat it was not gay friendly. Generally, I&#39;m not keen on religion as I find <br/>\nit divisive in nature and so not spiritual in the way I understand <br/>\nspirituality. On the other hand the group promotes all of the qualities that <br/>\nmake a society inclusive and supportive. Daisy is an elf and elves think of <br/>\nothers before themselves :~), the sentiment is wonderful. Anyway, I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow about the gay issue and the boy scouts. We do not want to be involved or <br/>\nsupport anything that&#39;s not gay friendly. What&#39;s your take on this issue, as <br/>\nI assume you and Beth are lesbians, and if not you would probably be able to <br/>\nanswer my question anyway.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the first thing to keep in mind is that the boys Scouts and Girl Scouts <br/>\nare two separate organizations with completely different policies. Girl <br/>\nScouts does NOT discriminate against gay folks, and is not <br/>\nChristian/religious the way that Boy Scouts is. Beth has always been out at <br/>\nwork, and her council has quite a few lesbian staff members.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never done Boy Scouts for TWO reasons--not only are they gay adverse, <br/>\nbut they also don&#39;t like Unitarian Universalists, which we are. All in all, <br/>\nnot a good match for the lesbian UU family.<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9883,"nextTopicId":9893}}
