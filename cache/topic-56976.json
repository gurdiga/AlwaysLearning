I also have an ancient PC that I am keeping so my kids one day can play some of my really old PC games (The Journeyman project - now I feel really old :)). There really are very few games out that are worth playing and when you add his age, I would think the list gets even shorter. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my favorite games (with the warning that I am not sure that are OK for a 8yo, my kids are younger, so it is hard for me to judge) are Star Ocean: The Second Story (PS, but all the PS are backwards compatible), Dragon Warrior I&II&III (GB), Golden Sun (GBA - if I recall correctly GBA is backwards compatible too). Now these are all RPG games, and there is fantasy fighting, so again it all gets back to what do you want him to get out of the game. There is a fair amount of reading too to follow the story line. They all are rated E, so supposedly suitable for 6+. If you think there is a game he might like and you don&#39;t want to play it beforehand, check gamefaqs.com reviews to get a better sense of the game. Another genre that might appeal to a boy is strategy, so Harvest Moon series maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287618285,"authorName":"Karen Buxcel","from":"Karen Buxcel &lt;thewildtribe@...&gt;","profile":"blackhillsdoula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: recommendations for handheld videogame console?","postDate":"1289860602","msgId":58120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrVlUtckZURk45TkFHNDdpd3VzbzBhY2FHbWlHeVVIWG9CWVcwPUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGliczViditkM3BlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGliczF1citrY3I1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aWJzNWJ2K2QzcGVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58117,"nextInTopic":58126,"prevInTime":58119,"nextInTime":58121,"topicId":56976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We started with Gameboy Advance, then moved on to DS s -- our oldest now has an iPod touch and the other devices currently collect dust.

The games  <br/>\nthemselves are a totally subjective thing. What does she like? Is she  <br/>\nreading? I would say the Petz games (Dogz and Catz), and Nintendogs  <br/>\n(from my daughter&#39;s experience) are good for non- or beginning  <br/>\nreaders. I hear that  My Little Pony, Sonic Rush, and some Disney  <br/>\ngames are good, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think looking at purpose behind such a purchase is a good starting  <br/>\npoint. I know, because when I was first looking at getting my daughter  <br/>\na system, it was to keep her occupied at our first unschooling  <br/>\nconference. It was a misguided idea and a long-time unschooler pointed  <br/>\nthat out to me, thank goodness. I got her one because she was  <br/>\ninterested, in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] recommendations for handheld videogame console?","postDate":"1282700340","msgId":56977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltS2VTUWlyWU5xNEx3NUctREI1dXZPZEtUM09MWVVVaVRNMTYtTEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlteWtnMTcxeUhVZCt2VjlhRG9BLXlSOWVoRW9lUUZYdXZ2NVluREBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlteWtnMTcxeUhVZCt2VjlhRG9BLXlSOWVoRW9lUUZYdXZ2NVluREBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56976,"nextInTopic":56980,"prevInTime":56976,"nextInTime":56978,"topicId":56976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Vicki wrote: **Am looking for something that would be entertaining in instances where she needs to be quietly occupied and forego the I m bored every 2","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1707514610\">Vicki wrote:<br/>\n**Am looking for something that would be entertaining in instances where she<br/>\nneeds to be quietly occupied and forego the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; every 2 minutes.<br/>\nRecommendations?

Would you want this for your<br/>\nspouse or your friend--to quietly occupy themselves, rather than express a<br/>\nneed?   Would you consider it a successful marriage if you hadn&#39;t spoken to<br/>\nyour spouse in months or a year?  To a small child five minutes, or an hour<br/>\ncan be too long without connection, cuddle or a glass of water.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about getting a child off your back or out of your way.<br/>\nQuite the opposite it is with engaging children, supporting their interests<br/>\nand meeting their needs. Unschooling is not unparenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen does she need to occupy herself? While you are using the bathroom, in<br/>\nthe shower, making dinner...<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about including her rather than ditching her, or perhaps offer a walk,<br/>\na tea party, or a trip to the grocery store to break the monotony of her<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"recommendations for handheld videogame console?","postDate":"1282699296","msgId":56976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlteWtnMTcxeUhVZCt2VjlhRG9BLXlSOWVoRW9lUUZYdXZ2NVluREBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56977,"prevInTime":56975,"nextInTime":56977,"topicId":56976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All my knowledge is way out of date!

I never even got all that familiar with<br/>\nGameboy if that gives you any idea. .<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remember people talking about the DS even for the preschool age group<br/>\nbut in shopping around I discovered there is also a DS Lite.  Too many<br/>\nofferings.   Part of my concern is that stylus thing.   Is that necessary<br/>\nfor all of the games?  And aside from the likelihood of losing it, is it<br/>\nattractive as a weapon?  Or even just dangerous in the same fashion as<br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t poke your eye out with that pencil&quot; (Do kids use pencils anymore?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a game system more appropriate for a 5 year old or is DS Lite<br/>\n&quot;the&quot;  thing these days?   My granddaughter is not intimidated by computers<br/>\nand has been playing with her parents i phones since she was a toddler.   Am<br/>\nlooking for something that would be entertaining in instances where she<br/>\nneeds to be quietly occupied and forego the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; every 2 minutes.<br/>\nRecommendations?
