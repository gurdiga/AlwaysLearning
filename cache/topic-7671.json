Often","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-329359723\">When my oldest was about 3, we lived in a neighborhood in which all the<br/>\nstreets had &quot;Park&quot; in them...Park Valley, Willow Park, Memorial Parkway,<br/>\netc..  Often confusing even for adults new to the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were out for a walk one day and run across a kid about 5 on a bike,<br/>\nbawling his head off in a panic.  It was his first day at a new babysitter&#39;s<br/>\nhome and he had gone out to ride his bike, turned the corner when he had<br/>\nbeen told not to and couldn&#39;t find the street again.  About the time we<br/>\nstopped, a lady in a van stopped to help as well.  Neither of us knew each<br/>\nother or the kid so we didn&#39;t feel comfortable letting the other leave with<br/>\nthe kid.  Finally, we all piled into the van, stroller and all and drove<br/>\naround the neighborhood looking for something that looked familiar to the<br/>\nlittle boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, the kid calmed down enough to answer questions and we discovered<br/>\nhis older sister was in 2nd grade at the local elementary school.  We called<br/>\nup there, talked to the sister who could tell us where the parents worked<br/>\nand we were able to get in touch with them.  The parents told us how to get<br/>\nto the babysitter&#39;s who was also in a panic searching for the kid.  I like<br/>\nto think one of the parents quit work to stay home with the kids after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7669,"nextTopicId":7672}}
