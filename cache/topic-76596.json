It has yet to return, though he is working hard to get it going. We moved house twice in one year, landing, finally, and very happily, in my mother-in-law&#39;s garage. We are living off what&#39;s left of our savings. There was no way of hiding the changes in our life from the kids, who are 8, 5 and 3. <br>We live in California, where we have been living with a pretty serious drought for several years. The kids understand conserving water, that the rains aren&#39;t there to replenish the reservoirs, etc. They have been living with the concept of drought most of their lives, and it hasn&#39;t really impacted them negatively, just something going on in the background of their lives.&nbsp; So I told them we were in a money drought, that droughts can last one season, or years, there&#39;s no way of knowing for sure. <br>I made sure to keep our social life going without much change. And we got creative with purchases, like other posters have suggested. We used airline miles to buy Christmas gifts. <br>At first my 8 year old talked of our drought, even told friends about it, very matter-of-factly, which I thought was sweet.There was no shame or sadness associated with it. It doesn&#39;t come up anymore. We adjusted to our new normal, which is still drought mode. <br>For me, this has been a huge learning experience, in many ways, and has made me a better parent and partner, forged by fire. <br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2059227769ygroups-quoted\">&nbsp;</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Job and money problems","postDate":"1453954594","msgId":76606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0QTZERjFBLTVDRkYtNDhGRC05RDg2LUMwMzE1REQ1QzJCQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0xfTFRhK2g4dUV1ZnhMPXNTWkFyMVk9WHNMOGMxMjBPdGFTNkV4OXFId3RjZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdCOTBBRTJBLUNEMzctNEQ5MC04REIyLTM5RkE4Qzg2MzkzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEU4MzUyMEI2LTg3OUYtNDM5Qi1BRkI2LTk1Mzk0MDY4NjIyQ0B5YWhvby5jb20+IDxDQU1ISktMOW5UY1NaaEFMR25TZEhXS3RQUkVhMzJfOGloVXVjX21CSkVHTDlERFB2Q0FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxBQkQ1QTVBOS0yOTlBLTRBRTItQjIyQy0yRDZEMDYzRTU1NTRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw1QURDQUQ3My1BQjIxLTQyNDctQjFBMi1GQUNDQTUwQkE5RThAeWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0FNSEpLTF9MVGEraDh1RXVmeEw9c1NaQXIxWT1Yc0w4YzEyME90YVM2RXg5cUh3dGNnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76605,"nextInTopic":76609,"prevInTime":76605,"nextInTime":76607,"topicId":76596,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-You can choose to live fearfully or you can choose to live joyfully.

Their role as the provider/bread winner.  It sounds like your husband is at loose ends adapting to his new normal.  Maybe you could make an effort to remind him of all the reasons you love and value him that don&#39;t have to do with his ability to bring a paycheck.  Focus on his many other good qualities.  You said your husband feels like a failure.  Help him see himself as a success.  <div><br></div><div>You said, &quot;it is hard to be in the house with that and turn it into abundance&quot;  Start by making a list in your head of all the ways your life and your kids lives would be worse if your husband wasn&#39;t there.  Take steps to protect your partnership.  </div><div><br></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spouses\">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>--Sylvia Woodman </div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1867323862gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1867323862gmail_quote\">On Wed, Jan 27, 2016 at 1:18 PM, Alex &amp; Brian Polikowsky <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polykowholsteins@...\">polykowholsteins@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1867323862gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div><br></div><div>About 8 years ago when the economy collapsed so did our finances for several reasons.</div><div><br></div><div>I went from being able to buy my kids things and go places to counting pennies literally.</div><div>There were days we had to search for loose change around the house to buy some bread.</div><div><br></div><div>What I did to keep the kids happy was to do MORE with them! </div><div>I was already pretty savvy at buying things second hand but I got even better at it!</div><div><br></div><div>There are also lots of places that are free to go!</div><div><br></div><div>I would make things abundant by getting lots of movies and books at the library for example!</div><div>I would pack lunch to go places but spend two dollars in icecream or French fries .</div><div><br></div><div>We did lots of playdate at the time.</div><div>We played together a lot.

Marty was 13, and I broke my ankle.<br/>\nThose involved hospitals, casts, wheel chairs, crutches, LOTS of inconvenience for me and for everyone around me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mental inventory of what IS working, and what IS possible will help much more than money, even.  Beause clearly there are wealthy people who are unhappy.  And there are very poor people who are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn’t work well with fear, so as team captain, a mom with a husband who is in a slump needs to generate enough cheer for the family, to bolster things until life is better.  Or to learn to see the “better” in life as it is.  Both, probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in college, onr of our housematees one year was from New York City.  Her dad had been a television producer or director and his big-deal last show had been cancelled, or come to the end of a successful run, or whatever.  She had grown up with a maid and a cook and sometimes a driver.  Her dad didn’t pick up more work, and she had gone 2000 miles away to a university—transportation, housing, out-of-state tuition (over twice as much as in-state kids were paying). <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day she got a phone call from her dad, and she sounded distraught, so I thought someone had been hospitalized or died.  She got off the phone and cried.<br/>\nWhen I could ask her whether I could help, she said her dad had taken a job managing some apartments.  I asked whether he was living in them; no.  Did he need to fix things?  No.  Just handle leases and collect the rent, and order repairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.<br/>\nAt that time, my dad was managing some apartments in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  He was living in one, and doing all the repairs on the others.  Someone else handled rental approvals and money and keys.<br/>\nMy dad was doing that because after all his very physical jobs—welding, construction, doing machinery set-up and repair for a mining company, repairing engines and machinery—he had developed arthritis and wasn’t able to do the kind of work he had done to support our family and put me in school and pay for my living with this other girl (and some less irritating housemates).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing that what one has is more than what another family has EVER had can be healthy, humbling, grounding.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarriage vows used to, and seems they should still, include something along the lines of “for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer.”   Impatience or frustration with the fear (and maybe depression and inertia) that can come with a layoff or a downturn or a lesser-paying job might be natural, but it’s possible to make higher and better choices, with practice, for good reasons.   The peace of children and the health of the marriage are good reasons. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese pages might help.<br/>\nhttp;//sandradodd.com/negativity  (finding little ways to be more positive in word, and thought, and deed make life better every single time)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/divorce\">http://sandradodd.com/divorce</a>   (don’t say or do things that will poison a relationship)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky","from":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Job and money problems","postDate":"1453918726","msgId":76597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4MzUyMEI2LTg3OUYtNDM5Qi1BRkI2LTk1Mzk0MDY4NjIyQ0B5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCOTBBRTJBLUNEMzctNEQ5MC04REIyLTM5RkE4Qzg2MzkzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDdCOTBBRTJBLUNEMzctNEQ5MC04REIyLTM5RkE4Qzg2MzkzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76596,"nextInTopic":76601,"prevInTime":76596,"nextInTime":76598,"topicId":76596,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"About 8 years ago when the economy collapsed so did our finances for several reasons.
