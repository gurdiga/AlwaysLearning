Everytime I hit the M-1 ..... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were driving from York to London, it was stressful.  Seemed others <br/>\nwere stressed, and rushing, and stopping and starting.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, for me, it&#39;s just that they were all driving on the wrong side of the <br/>\nroad and every truck seemed like imminent death.   Then we stopped at a <br/>\nrestaurant, somewhere around Lincoln or south of there? and then I discovered <br/>\nclotted cream, having missed it somehow before.  Then I wanted to stay <br/>\nanother week and eat clotted cream.   I&#39;ve found they sell little glass jars <br/>\nof it at the health food store three blocks from my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in England the first time I was young and alone and homesick, and <br/>\nwas downtown London, walking around alone, and I went to the Twinings Tea <br/>\nshop (VERY small shop), and there was a little alley to the left of there, <br/>\ntoward Picadilly Square, I think.  There was an Indian wedding in the <br/>\nneighborhood, and LOTS of couple went by with the women all in gold-thread <br/>\nsaris.  And then I turned and saw a tiny travel agency.  The entire business <br/>\nwas probably no bigger than one of my childrens&#39; bedrooms.   But the window <br/>\nby the front door was ENTIRELY taken up with a poster of the Grand Canyon.  <br/>\nNo words, just the photo.  At least six feet high, from about my knee level <br/>\nup.  As wide as the reach of my arms.  And I stayed still in front of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was 24 and had lived  all my life in Texas and in New Mexico.  I was at the <br/>\nGrand Canyon when I was two.  There are photographs.  But not since.  And it <br/>\ndidnt&#39; matter.  MUCH of New Mexico is that big, that awesome, that quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I stood in front of that poster and KNEW, deeper than my gut, why that <br/>\nwas so wonderful to people who had always been in England, where houses are <br/>\nsmall, cars are small, roads are small, shops are small, things are busy and <br/>\ntended.  Back yard &quot;gardens&quot; are gorgeous lawns surrounded by wonderful <br/>\nflowers, put in artfully, reproducing themselves heartily year after year.  <br/>\nMost of what is seen is touched and tended by man.  And what isn&#39;t has a <br/>\nhuman history.  Sherwood Forest.  Lincoln Forest.   Even a kid from New <br/>\nMexico can know tales of life and death in those places.  Some fields were <br/>\ncleared a thousand years ago, and copses of trees stand like little islands <br/>\nin some of the larger ones.  Maybe those trees have never been cleared, ever. <br/>\n And exotic (to me) birds, and hedgehogs, and foxes might live in there.  but <br/>\nthe whole little tree-island might not be bigger than an American house and <br/>\nyard, or a little shopping center we&#39;re so used to.  And it is surrounded by <br/>\nman.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the Grand Canyon stretches for hundreds of untended, un-looked at miles <br/>\non either side of the visitor&#39;s centers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesing to overlay a same-scale map of the grand canyon on <br/>\nEngland.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10369,"nextTopicId":10392}}
