Sometimes plain (no butter, no salt) popcorn helps if he can munch<br/>\nit.  Reading usually makes it worse, as does anything close (gameboy, etc.).<br/>\nLooking out the front window helps Tim the most, so we often put him in the<br/>\nmiddle.  An option, if you have the space to do it.  Sleeping is the best<br/>\nbet -- he never gets carsick asleep!  We tried the gum (is that<br/>\nhomeopathic?) that most kids seem to love, but it made Tim throw up.  Maybe<br/>\nsomething in it didn&#39;t work for him, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the elevators go, I&#39;d figure so what.  I don&#39;t care for elevators,<br/>\neither, but I didn&#39;t ride in them hardly at all until I was grown up.  They<br/>\ncertainly weren&#39;t necessary in my life until I worked in big office<br/>\nbuildings.  I fail to see how pushing her about them now will make her<br/>\nhappier later.  Probably more like pushing now will make her hate them more<br/>\nlater.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and experience as a psychiatric nurse is fine, but it doesn&#39;t make one<br/>\nthe psychiatrist any more than working as a surgical nurse makes one the<br/>\nsurgeon.  Yes, your Mom may have picked up some stuff working with psych<br/>\npatients, but that doesn&#39;t make her the expert on it.  And I can&#39;t imagine<br/>\ntaking a child to a psychiatrist because she doesn&#39;t like elevators!  She<br/>\ncan just take the stairs and call it exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12270,"nextTopicId":12401}}
