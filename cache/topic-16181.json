He lists at a very fast pace <br/>\n<br/>\nall the things you can find in a hardware store.  It&#39;s great. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s on the new CD, Poodle Hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t do that last night.  I think it&#39;s a studio-only situation, same <br/>\nas &quot;Everything you Know is Wrong.&quot;  I think it&#39;s two tracks and he stops a line <br/>\nto breathe, and the final is both sets of every other line, put together to <br/>\nseem he could go 90 seconds without breathing.  Though I will say he&#39;s got a <br/>\nTON of stamina and strength, and dances and jumps and sings and acts for nearly <br/>\ntwo hours straight.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She&#39;s trying to master that one.  Very difficult.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s doable.  I know the words to &quot;Everything You Know is <br/>\nWrong,&quot; but it can&#39;t really be sung.  Not by me, anyway, and I don&#39;t think by Al <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I love Omish Paradise. (sung to Gangters Paradise).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAmish. &lt;g&gt; He did that last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And the Emminem one about watching TV til your brain turns to mush is <br/>\n<br/>\nreally funny.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did that too, after an &quot;Al TV&quot; video interview with Emminem.  He had <br/>\nseveral of those:  Avril Lavigne,  Justin Timberlake, Celine Dion.  It would be <br/>\nclips of them answering questions from interviews, or saying something inane, <br/>\nintercut with him asking questions to SEEM they were responding to him.  <br/>\nHILARIOUS.  So with Emminem, he had lots of statements about artistic freedom, and <br/>\nthen said &quot;So you think someone should be able to do a parody of a video?&quot;  and <br/>\nlike that, then came out and did the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have videos on big screens (and some nice smaller TVs between the <br/>\nspeakers and the audience, for anyone who can&#39;t see well) to cover for costume <br/>\nchanges, of which there were many.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;He came to our area about 5 years ago, but we weren&#39;t into him at the <br/>\n<br/>\ntime.  I hope he comes back soon!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis shows are definitely worth seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16174,"nextTopicId":16182}}
