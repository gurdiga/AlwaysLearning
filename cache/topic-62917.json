It’s hard to be happy in a house where someone else seems unhappy.   If you can think of a way to help yourself it might start to make things better.   <br/>\n<br/>\nExcursions to new places would give you something to do.  Dylan really liked hiking and camping when he was twelvish.  If you don’t have time for a weekend camping maybe day hikes would be fun.  Find a trail and see what&#39;s at the other end.  Visit stores or museums or galleries or movie theaters or restaurants you’ve never been to before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids get more thoughtful and philosophical around that age.   There are almost always stories in the news papers that can inspire discussions about patriotism, morality, religion, human rights... Movies might lead to philosophical discussion.  (Or not, they’re fun, and that’s enough)  If anyone around here needs cheering up gory horror movies or old, bad sci-fi usually work wonders.    There are spoof news websites and TV shows that can be really funny.    There is the marvelous Eddie Izzard. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to go for long walks at night.  It was something to do and it gave us a chance to talk about anything at all... or not talk.   Lots of times our conversations gave me ideas for things Dylan might like to do or places he might like to go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about board games?   Chess? Cribbage? Risk?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still play a couple of crazy games:  Novelist, where you write descriptions or paragraphs of crappy novels.   Word swap games where you replace one word in a book or movie title with another.  Renaming books so the title means the same thing but lacks the beauty of the original.    For added fun require some reference to poop or sex or vomit or whatever seems hilarious at the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nLot’s of times boredom is a feeling of being a little lost. Avoid being pushy or annoying but try finding ways to reconnect.  Sit with him while he plays his video games if he’s ok with that.    Eat with him.  Go where he is and chat or hang out if he seems to be enjoying your company.   Put on some music and dance.  Declare a Nerf war.   Give him more of *you* and you might both start feeling better. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;","postDate":"1316220930","msgId":62926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRWhNejVLdnhQN0hkMmtyX2JZVT02TDM3WFd2YTZaallUTWt5NGFuS3FQMTBRblAwQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUDlOWEp2dHU2MzRpUTIrT1BGSmg4NnBKMjRobU1PRDIyZ0xzZ0JBMkJlZlA2Zk1mUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUDlOWEp2dHU2MzRpUTIrT1BGSmg4NnBKMjRobU1PRDIyZ0xzZ0JBMkJlZlA2Zk1mUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62925,"nextInTopic":62944,"prevInTime":62925,"nextInTime":62927,"topicId":62917,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-8775397\">&lt;&lt;&lt;My 11 y/o is having intense moments of boredom and I&#39;m not sure really<br/>\nwhat<br/>\nto do to help him because I&#39;m pretty bored with things right now as well.<br/>\nTypically he spends most of his day gaming but he seems to be losing his<br/>\ninterest in that, even losing interest in new games pretty quickly after<br/>\ngetting them.
