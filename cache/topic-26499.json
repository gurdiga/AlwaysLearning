The pressure for our  <br/>\nkids to perform better than school kids was tremendous.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling has opened us up to life...to family, time spent together, time  <br/>\nspent pursuing what we love, enjoy, are passionate about.  When I made the  <br/>\ncomment that &quot;I think each kid has a TV in their rooms&quot; I realized later I would <br/>\n have hidden that fact in the past from other more academic and especially  <br/>\nreligous home schoolers.

I just want to know you are<br/>\nreal.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing my kids do sometimes that irritates me is to look at the<br/>\nnegative side of things.  On occasion they are tired or stuck in a rut and<br/>\nthey seem to see the worst in people and in themselves too.  It drives me<br/>\ncrazy.  I am a person who focuses on the glass being half full rather than<br/>\nhalf empty.  I have a hard time being around people who see all the negative<br/>\nthings in life and not the hundred little positive things that are around us<br/>\nevery day all the time.  When they get like that though, I know that<br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t right and we talk about it and try to get to the bottom of<br/>\nthe issue that is of concern to them.  (sometimes they just need a little<br/>\nmore sleep) We also talk about how their attitude can affect the people<br/>\naround them.  Often just drawing their attention to it makes them realize<br/>\nthey are doing it and they apologize and find something positive to think<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rarely argue here.  We sometime misunderstand each other and get a little<br/>\ngrumpy but we always talk about it immediately and figure out where the<br/>\nmisunderstanding came from and sort it out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one thing that is important to mention is that in our family we all<br/>\nseem to have a high intrapersonal intelligence. (We all seem to know<br/>\nourselves well and what we want most of the time.  We don&#39;t have to try to<br/>\nfigure each other out, we just ask.) Interpersonally is more challenging for<br/>\nall of us outside our own family.  (I just don&#39;t get what makes some people<br/>\ntick sometimes.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel socially awkward in a group setting.  But I have to say<br/>\nrecently I&#39;ve dealt with some kids who seem to have no clue about what other<br/>\npeople might be feeling at all and it shows so much in how they talk to<br/>\nother people, inadvertently putting them down without thinking about it<br/>\nmuch.  (public schooled kids too...there goes that socialization issue<br/>\narguement)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure where this is going really.  I just thought I&#39;d answer your post as<br/>\nif you were talking to me.  We are a real family.  We have our frustrations<br/>\nand our misunderstandings.  The girls have free access to TV, yet don&#39;t<br/>\nwatch all day long most of the time.  We spend time with our animals, we<br/>\nplay games (board and computer), email, write to penpals, they visit friends<br/>\nand have them over, enjoy pony club, swimming in our small pool, going to<br/>\nwater parks, hanging out.  The girls are happy.  They play well together.<br/>\nWe problem solve when misunderstandings happen but life is generally pretty<br/>\nsmooth and enjoyable.  But like I said, I focus on the good things.  Life is<br/>\ngood!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;I just want to know you are real.&quot;","postDate":"1154534353","msgId":26499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhGNURGQjA3LUQ1NzQtNDNCQi1BNDA3LUQ1OTREN0Q1NERBMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26502,"prevInTime":26498,"nextInTime":26500,"topicId":26499,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Do your kids ever do anything that irritates you, troubles you, makes you mad?

I wrote it myself  <br/>\nyears ago, and made it public in the hope that it would help others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf finding where you can relax and settle and be just better than the  <br/>\nworst things some of us have ever done is going to comfort you,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing QUITE a school thing, I think, which is grading on the  <br/>\ncurve. Justifying slack.  I don&#39;t want to justify slack in my life or  <br/>\nto help others do so.  That would not make me more &quot;real.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone here remembers the last time someone told us (here or  <br/>\non UnschoolingDiscussion) that she would feel better if people would  <br/>\ntell her of the times they&#39;d failed.  Maybe you could be directed to  <br/>\nthat thread if you want.   A list where people share negative stories  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be as helpful as one where they share successes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find LOTS of places where moms badmouth their kids and  <br/>\njustify their own failures and the moms all sooth and comfort each  <br/>\nother while belitting their kids.  They&#39;ll take turns saying &quot;it&#39;s So  <br/>\nHARD being a mom, and kids are so silly/immature/crazy/mean/ <br/>\nsneaky.&quot;   Maybe that&#39;s not what you have in mind.  I hope not, but  <br/>\nsuch places exist in abundance.  They don&#39;t help people unschool,  <br/>\nexcept maybe in the way that they see that mindful parenting really  <br/>\nDOES make a profound difference in every part of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no one here is expecting this list to be the sole source of  <br/>\nunschooling information.  It was never intended to be that.  The  <br/>\nfirst assumption of this list, which I think is clear from the  <br/>\ndescription, is that I&#39;m assuming group members will have read some  <br/>\nJohn Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/<br/>\nThe whole group description is there, but in addition to the John  <br/>\nHolt preface (there&#39;s lots of Holt to read here:<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/johnholt )  it says &quot;It&#39;s an idea group and is  <br/>\nintended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, general  <br/>\nhomeschooling discussion�there are hundreds of general homeschooling  <br/>\ndiscussions for newcomers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are dozens of other sources linked for anyone who thinks this  <br/>\nlist alone isn&#39;t providing enough information.  This page also has  <br/>\nexisted for a while and hasn&#39;t been hidden:<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26532,"nextTopicId":26545}}
