Which<br/>\npart?  I live in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley) about an hour south of San<br/>\nFrancisco.  The Bay Area is home to about 6 million people which make<br/>\nunschooling great. You can always find someone to click with and there is<br/>\nabout a million things to do.   I know a lot of unschoolers, but do not know<br/>\nof a specific unschooling group here.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/California.htm)\">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/California.htm)</a> for more<br/>\nCalifornia information and support groups.  The (www.homefires.com<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/\">http://www.homefires.com/</a>&gt; ) site, while not particularly unschooling, is<br/>\ngood for Bay Area info if that&#39;s the place you are looking at.  I run a park<br/>\nday group that meets in the south bay (www.ParkHoppers.org<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.parkhoppers.org/\">http://www.parkhoppers.org/</a>&gt; ).  So, if you are ever in the area please<br/>\ncome and visit us.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion: I adore California, especially our area.  There are few native<br/>\nCalifornians around, so most people have made a conscious decision to make<br/>\nthis their home and seem to have more appreciation for the place where they<br/>\nlive.  The population is so diverse that people are very tolerant of others&#39;<br/>\ncultures and life styles.  There are mountains and forests and beaches all<br/>\nwithin an hour or so of where we live.  Not to mention, several major<br/>\ncities.  And..you can&#39;t beat the weather. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of mascire2<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 25, 2005 5:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] possible move to California<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\nThere is a chance that we could move to California soon, and I am <br/>\nwondering if anyone that lives there or has lived there can tell me <br/>\nanything and everything about living there.
