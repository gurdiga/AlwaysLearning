They were all in the backseat<br/>\nand my father was driving.  I commented, &quot;How<br/>\nconvienient,  Not only did he have you captive, unable<br/>\nto storm out or react how you needed to at the time,<br/>\nbut he didn&#39;t even have to look you in the eye while<br/>\nhe said it.&quot;  EXACTLY!  was what my brother said, and<br/>\nwas amazed that I had seen it so clearly from such a<br/>\ndistance of time.  But then, we did have the same<br/>\nfather after all.  Typical cowardly, controlling,<br/>\ndominating behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am glad to know that there is a positive aspect<br/>\nto this &quot;indirect&quot; conversation possible in cars, for<br/>\nawkward discussions that children WANT to have. <br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9124,"nextTopicId":9203}}
