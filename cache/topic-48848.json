NVC is a great tool for understanding other people and your own<br/>\nemotion. I think with How to talk...well there is the assumption the parent<br/>\nknows best and can manipulate the child into some goal. ***<br/>\n <br/>\nWhy manipulate at all?  Why not be honest with kids?  Yes, I need to do this now, and yes you can do this that or the other thing, but you still need to do this for it to work for everyone else.  You can still choose not to, but everyone else may be very pissed with you.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know... I tend to be very blunt and straight forward about these things.  I&#39;m not looking for underlying causes all the time.  I do think about these things in general, but in the moment, we want what we want, each of us, and navigating that doesn&#39;t always require knowing underlying needs.  If a child is upset about something, they say so, maybe not in exact words, but through actions sometimes.  It&#39;s always been pretty obvious to me what my kids need when they are screaming and crying in the moment, even if they don&#39;t use words.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn that way, the How to Talk book has been useful.  It gives concrete ways in which to offer choices and solutions that are very practical without delving into underlying needs and emotions, not that those don&#39;t exist or shouldn&#39;t ever be thought about.  The assumption that parents know best, well, sometimes they do.  That is why kids need parents to help them navigate the world because they do know more and better.  Acknowledging that and still respecting a child&#39;s lack of reasoning and allowing them to make choices, helps them better define their choices as they get older.  If I take the ideas in that book and apply them with unschooling ideas, what I get is, that we can have the same goal.  We get to be on a team, my kids and I.  The ideas become less about manipulation and more about working together within the parameter of one individual that has more power and more knowledge than the other.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a free choices for everything, kind of world.  Sometimes our feelings about things should be kept far away from our actions.  I allow a lot more actions related to feelings for my kids than I do for myself and even my husband.  If I ask my husband to fix the brakes on my car, I&#39;m not inclined to accept &quot;no&quot; as an answer.  Either he does it, or we spend a lot of extra money that he earns by working hard, to take it elsewhere.  It&#39;s mutually understood that some things should be done, even through a very deep sense of obligation, even IF we happen to not want to do it.  I&#39;d really like my kids to understand that too.  At a basic level, this is my problem with NVC.  I&#39;d rather assume that there are things we should just DO and say &quot;yes&quot; to because there is a need to do so, then shift my perspective from feeling &quot;put out&quot;, to doing it because I&#39;m obligated through love and that because of that, it is a pleasure to do things.<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps I misread NVC, but everytime I come across the NVC thinking, it reads as extremely selfish.  I put myself out a lot for my family, I can do it with joy, or I can do it with grumpiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: interesting issue; please advise","postDate":"1259957721","msgId":48890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkxMjA0MTIxNXAxYWQwYmUyNWxhOGYyODg2MWY3ZjlmNjcyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFQjBERkVCLTkxRDYtNDNCQS1BQTExLUI3NkJGMzdEM0IzQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDc5NTU0My4zOTU3NS5xbUB3ZWIyNjUwMi5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8N0VCMERGRUItOTFENi00M0JBLUFBMTEtQjc2QkYzN0QzQjNDQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":48887,"nextInTopic":48892,"prevInTime":48889,"nextInTime":48891,"topicId":48848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would suggest Non-Violent Communication over that book How to Talk so Kids will Listen.

NVC is a great tool for understanding other people and your own<br/>\nemotion.  I think with How to talk...well there is the assumption the parent<br/>\nknows best and can manipulate the child into some goal.  It is like the<br/>\nother La Leche Book:  Karen Pryor&#39;s Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog.  This book trains<br/>\nchildren to do what adults want with gentle positive reinforcement.  My<br/>\npartner kept thinking the LL books were a godsend and couldn&#39;t understand my<br/>\nrefusal to try these &quot;gentle&quot; parenting approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked a book called The Wonderchild.  I found the exercise where I<br/>\nswitched places with my child really informative.  IE He gets to be the<br/>\nadult.  It made me understand what I was doing wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nOr try roleplaying with another adult.  One of you gets to be &quot;the child&quot;.<br/>\nI remember someone once telling me &quot;you can&#39;t reason with a two year old&quot;.<br/>\nWell, not if your position is untenable.  They are infinitely logical and<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the same frame of reference--we do a lot of illogical things.  I<br/>\nlearned a lot from conversations I had with my kids as two year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember Rowan learned to put his jacket on.  Not the &quot;daycare way&quot; which<br/>\ninvolves putting the jacket on the floor and manoeuvres that an adult<br/>\nteaches a kid.  He put his jacket on by figuring out where the hood went and<br/>\nthen put in his right arm and his left, just like any adult.  One of my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s friends asked his daughter to teach Rowan how to put on his coat,<br/>\nand they thought she being a year and a bit older had something to show us.<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t like my parenting, because I talked to Rowan as though he were a<br/>\nmuch older child(respectfully) and seemed to constantly trying to show me<br/>\nwhat I was doing wrong and they told my husband, too.  Anyway, you guessed<br/>\nit, barely holding back the smirk I handed my not yet two year old his<br/>\njacket and he put it on.  The surprize was priceless.  How did you do that?<br/>\nI did not.  I spent a week catching up on chores, because Rowan decided<br/>\nrather than go to the playground and go down the &quot;side&quot; or go on the &quot;sings&quot;<br/>\nhe was going to learn to dress himself.  It was painful to watch.  Anger,<br/>\nfrustration, determination and then triumph. Rowan was on a roller coaster<br/>\nride of emotions, too.  Kidding--I was just delighted to catch up on some<br/>\nchores, but sorry he was going through this struggle.  I was offering help,<br/>\nand he knew support was there.  I also encouraged him and cheered him.  You<br/>\nlook really frustrated, want to take a break and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one day trying to use manipulative parenting to get Rowan into<br/>\nthe stroller--the infamous line, &quot;are you going into the stroller yourself<br/>\nor do I have to help you?&quot;  I swooped down to pick him up.  Rowan looked me<br/>\nin the eye and said, &quot;Put me down, now&quot;.  He was two years old.  So, I did.<br/>\nAll the other parents were staring.   In the end he wanted to stay, and I<br/>\nhad no pressing reason  to go, so we stayed.  Under the disapproving eye of<br/>\nall the other parents I sat down, and we cuddled.  I told him why I wanted<br/>\nto go and he told me he wanted to keep playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the parents clicked in disapproval.  I remember when I talked to the<br/>\nother parents one said in admiration:  my kids would have been kicking and<br/>\nyelling if I had picked them up.  I can&#39;t believe he was so calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI muttered:  well, I do put him down, when he asks.  I believe in bodily<br/>\nsovereignty and if he can&#39;t trust his mother not to invade his space and<br/>\nphysically manhandle him how is going to figure out if someone means him<br/>\nharm.  I don&#39;t want to raise a wifebeater or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still remember being told repeatedly he needed to respect me.  I think the<br/>\nfact that he didn&#39;t kick me in the stomach was pretty respectful for a two<br/>\nyear old, picked up against his will!<br/>\nAt this point I figured logically, children who are hit normalize the idea<br/>\nthat someone you love hurts you.  Or that adults don&#39;t need to respect the<br/>\nsoveriegnty of small children.  To me this notion was horrible and could be<br/>\nlife-threatening.  I figured if anyone didn&#39;t respect Rowan&#39;s body, he would<br/>\nknow that person meant harm.   So no matter how inconvenient I always drew<br/>\nthat boundary for myself and parents seemed more amenable to the idea that I<br/>\nwas modelling respect to protect him from predators,  than the idea that I<br/>\ntruly respected my kid enough not to treat him that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: interesting issue; please advise","postDate":"1259956626","msgId":48898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4RTdCM0UwLURDQjAtNDk2NS1BMjc5LTQ2QTIyQTlDNzMxMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyMTEyOC43ODcwOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhmYW9scytqNHRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTIxMTI4Ljc4NzA5LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48896,"nextInTopic":48904,"prevInTime":48897,"nextInTime":48899,"topicId":48848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I also don t agree with many things in the book having read about different intelligences and personalities.

He had reflux, food allergies, and difficulty sleeping, nursing etc.  I was very stressed as was my husband. He would come home from work with me there, having been there all day with my 15 month old and my crying baby (my 15 month old actually called him &quot;Cry&quot; for along time.) and I would be crazy and I would say to my husband, &quot;Do you want to wash the dishes or do you want to feed the kids?&quot;  Or then &quot;Do you want to hold the baby or do you want to give J a bath?&quot;  Etc... Drove my husband crazy. One day he flipped out.  He yelled, &quot; I dont want to do either of those things.  If you need me to do something just ask but I dont want to and giving me choices of two things I dont want to do right now doesnt help!&quot;  Kind of put it in perspective for me.  That being said, I have found giving choises helps with some of my kids.  Sometimes a choice from 8 pairs of pants is just too much.  But choosing from 2 helps.  The same son from above is now almost 7.  He doesnt like changes much and goes many days in the same clothes.  When I really feel we should get something different on him, I will say, &quot;B those pants are really dirty, lets get some new ones.  Do you want jeans or sweats?  He does have the choice to decline but typically I will make a deal with him that by that evening or before we leave home that he will choose to change.

So, for example when they say &quot;let children make choices&quot; (in images p140 in my edition), the choices are &quot;are you in the mood for your grey pants or your red pants?&quot; meaning &quot;put your pants whatever color it is... &quot;Would uou like half a glass of juice or a whole?&quot; meaning you have to drink something or one more, the best one : &quot;what would work best for ? Doing your practice before dinner or after?&quot; meaning... No choice : you have to practice. I&#39;m reading again this book to find other clear examples, but to me, it explains what you can do in order to make your kids do what YOU want. It seems nice at first because it tells you that your child is really person whereas it denies him/her this status alltogether. So, the kid can go from : &quot;what I want is not important&quot; (before the book is read by parents) to &quot;what I want is still not important but my parents think they are very kind about what I want and so certainly hope that I be very grateful&quot;. It prevents parents to rethink if what they demand is really so important and the kids become crazy because before : they knew they had to do what their parents say and after: they feel they have no choice whereas their parents want to believe they give them a choice.
