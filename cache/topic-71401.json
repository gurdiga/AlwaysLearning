And if you find unschoolers, they might not be kids he likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would find (or create) activities and invite other kids.  My kids have some friends they had from the park day gatherings when they were little, so either from La Leche League, or the unschooling park days, but in a very small town, maybe having a park day on a weekend (Sunday afternoon, maybe?) would be helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be too dismayed or critical about the other parents&#39; parenting, either.  You could isolate yourself into a lonely fantasy world.   If there are kids who get along, you could maybe arrange smaller things at your house just for those kids, and one-offsï¿½a party, a gaming session, a pizza-making dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes having a friend leads to other kids through that kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs kids get older, meeting kids with common interests (art, games, music, sports, hobbies) makes more sense than looking for others by whether or not they go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider online friendships too, with playing Minecraft or World of Warcraft or such things, and skyping.  That&#39;s a way to be in social contact with unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99977224,"authorName":"Melanie Campanis","from":"&quot;Melanie Campanis&quot; &lt;melanie@...&gt;","profile":"ntschechi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Friendship building","postDate":"1367930039","msgId":71410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGMwMWNlNGIxZiQyNjNlNzVhMCQ3MmJiNjBlMCRAY2FtcGFuaXMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGttOXIxcSsxZ2FnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGttOXIxcSsxZ2FnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71408,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":71409,"nextInTime":71411,"topicId":71401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might want to set up a group for eclectic homeschoolers - I think you will then find folk who are more likely to think outside the box.
