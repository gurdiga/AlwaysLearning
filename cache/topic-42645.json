The interesting thing is that the first<br/>\ngives incremental help with the second, but the second can help with<br/>\nthe first. You can get better at playing one song, even if you don&#39;t<br/>\npractice it, by learning other songs.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Joyce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m &quot;training&quot; to play a song in a recital, and there&#39;s a  <br/>\ndeadline, and I want to focus on doing that, then playing it slowly  <br/>\nbut carefully and building up to speed might be the most efficient  <br/>\nway to do that.  But if I&#39;m practicing sight reading, for the joy of  <br/>\nseeing how well I can do it, then I&#39;m not &quot;learning a song,&quot; I&#39;m  <br/>\nsight reading.  And sight reading gets better when it&#39;s done more  <br/>\nrecklessly.  Those afraid of making a mistake won&#39;t be brave enough  <br/>\nto sight read vocal music.  That really involves some sliding around  <br/>\nsometimes when a part isn&#39;t well known, and playing it on the piano  <br/>\nuntil you know what it sounds like is not at all sight reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith recorder, the instrument I can best do by ear (not counting  <br/>\nvoice) OR by music, everything I know about music from any direction  <br/>\ncomes into use.  But I know the instrument well enough that if I know  <br/>\nthe tune in my head I can play it on the recorder.  I might make a  <br/>\nmistake, but when I&#39;ve figured out what that one interval is (from  <br/>\nguessing wrong and finding the right note), it helps me with every  <br/>\nother song in the future that has that particular jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if spelling is like music (and watching Holly learn to spell, I  <br/>\nthink for some people it can be), then the more words she knows, the  <br/>\nmore she can sort through words and see what&#39;s similar and what&#39;s  <br/>\npart of a set or pattern, and what&#39;s an exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my lifelong interest in the history of words, when my kids  <br/>\nhave asked how to spell something, I&#39;ve usually told them two  <br/>\nthings:  The spelling, and the why of it, VERY briefly.  It helps  <br/>\nthem remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spelling of the number two is easier to remember if one knows it  <br/>\nwas once pronounced &quot;twa&quot; and that it&#39;s the root of &quot;twin,&quot; &quot;twice&quot;  <br/>\nand lots of other such words.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly asked me about some word...  She&#39;s asleep so I can&#39;t  <br/>\nask.  It was about the adjective form of some word that&#39;s been in  <br/>\nEnglish from Norman French for many hundreds of years.  We have the  <br/>\nFrench form and the English form.  You can end it with &quot;-ful&quot; or &quot;- <br/>\nment&quot;--either the English form or the French.  They have slightly  <br/>\ndifferent connotations.    (I&#39;ll ask her later if she remembers what  <br/>\nword it was.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m as interested in English as some people are in Sodoku or  <br/>\nautomotive history.  It&#39;s easy for me because it&#39;s fun.  That&#39;s the  <br/>\nidea behind lots of learning.  Music, too!

The other is a  <br/>\nmore general knowing how to move your fingers over the instrument.  <br/>\nThe first comes from playing one song over and over. The second comes  <br/>\nfrom learning many songs. The interesting thing is that the first  <br/>\ngives incremental help with the second, but the second can help with  <br/>\nthe first.

Even she couldn&#39;t read <br/>\nwhat she&#39;d written if she picked it up a bit later.

Then she did NaNoWriMo. Wrote a 50,000 word <br/>\nnovel in a month. She didn&#39;t show it to anybody so I can&#39;t tell you how <br/>\nthe spelling was, but she wrote it in Microsoft Word and used the spell <br/>\nchecker. She says that was what turned her spelling around for her. <br/>\nWell, that and one other discovery - she could look at a list of ways to <br/>\nspell a word: cta, act, cat, tca, tac, and she could pick the correct <br/>\none out of the list. But even immediately after doing that, she couldn&#39;t <br/>\npicture how to spell it. So, when Word guessed what she was trying to <br/>\nspell and gave her enough choices, she could pick the right one out of <br/>\nthe list. She had to get close enough for Word to give her a list that <br/>\nincluded the correct word, so it wasn&#39;t an immediate fix, but she slowly <br/>\ngot better and better at it and then the spell checker worked well for <br/>\nher. Over the next few years she wrote a lot - did NaNoWriMo again every <br/>\nyear plus ScriptFrenzy which is writing a screenplay.  Her spelling is <br/>\ngood now. She&#39;s 18 and a college student. No fear - total ownership over <br/>\nher own ability to learn in her own way and in her own time!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy knees feel weak when I think about what could have been done to her <br/>\nin the name of helping her with what would have been called her learning <br/>\ndisabilities.

I resisted the urge to push or prod and say things like &quot;look it up&quot;<br/>\nwhen she asked how something was spelled.  I just answered her question<br/>\nnicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day she announced that she wanted to learn to spell and asked if I would<br/>\nhelp.  I said, &quot;Sure, just let me know what you&#39;d like me to do&quot;.  She began<br/>\nto spell almost everything she laid her eyes on, all she wanted from me is<br/>\nto confirm if it was correct.  Within 2 weeks she was spelling as well as<br/>\nany high school student and could probably go up against most college<br/>\nstudents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy inner control freak breathed a sigh of relief but it was the last time I<br/>\nfretted over what she was learning and when, spelling was nothing compared<br/>\nto the big picture.  She wanted to learn something and never thought she<br/>\nneeded &quot;teaching&quot;, she was in control and found her own way to the goal.<br/>\nThat was MY lesson, all I had to do was back off and I got to watch how<br/>\ntrusting her and letting go gave her the room and power to learn on her own<br/>\nterms.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I could have loaded her with spelling lists, reminding, prodding and<br/>\nfretting.  She probably would have learned to spell but also doubt her<br/>\nability to learn and feel the need to be taught.  I&#39;d rather she still not<br/>\nspell very well but trust herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n-- <br/>\nIf God is satisfied with the work, the work may be satisfied with itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCS Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262126106,"authorName":"frazzledhetumom","from":"&quot;frazzledhetumom&quot; &lt;chetu@...&gt;","profile":"frazzledhetumom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Spelling question","postDate":"1235696688","msgId":42690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvN2U3ZytqOGF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzQjZFRDU4LTNFNUMtNEFGRS1BMjM3LTRGMTExNUQzRTExOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42688,"nextInTopic":42691,"prevInTime":42689,"nextInTime":42691,"topicId":42645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-We do not drill or test in my home, but our whole family just loves spelling games.Things we play are spelling bees when in the car, where we will rattle off","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1702953743\">-We do not drill or test in my home, but our whole family just loves <br/>\nspelling games.Things we play are spelling bees when in the car, <br/>\nwhere we will rattle off words for the kids to spell. Or we will play <br/>\na game where we state a catagory such as animals or cities and one <br/>\nperson will say a name such as New York and the next player has to <br/>\ncome up with a word that begins with the last letter in the name ( in <br/>\nthis example the letter K).  I will also without a word sit down to <br/>\none of my kids and do a word search puzzle, the whole time having a <br/>\nconversation with myself such as man, this word &quot;frankenstein&quot; is <br/>\nreally giving me a problem, I can not seem to find it. Or say how <br/>\ninteresting a certain word is, pretty much ignoring my child however <br/>\nbefore long they can not resist mom&#39;s having fun and start helping <br/>\nfind the words or point out words that are interesting to them. We <br/>\nplay hangman which is becoming a favorite for my second grade <br/>\ndaughter, we play in a room where there are many words on the walls <br/>\nso when it is her turn, she can look at a word and know how to spell <br/>\nit, all I have to do is bury my face in a book when she is searching <br/>\nfor a word so I do not see what word she is looking at. There are <br/>\nposters and all sorts of things on the walls with many words for her <br/>\nto choose from.  We play boggle, scrabble, fill in the blank word <br/>\ngames. My kids both love BookWorm Adventures which is a computer <br/>\nsoftware game designed for kids where they have to spell yet in a <br/>\ngame form. I also put up a blog site for each of my kids and they <br/>\nLOVE writing on these blogs, and learn how to use spell check as well <br/>\nand this has been improving writing and spelling skills tremendously. <br/>\nI also keep putting up interesting links for them on their blog sites <br/>\nfor them to explore at will. We sit down and write letters to <br/>\ngrandma . I have them tell me a story while we tape record it then I <br/>\ntype up their story for them. When they ask how to spell something I <br/>\ntell them. If they ask a question on how to spell a word that has a <br/>\nspelling rule, I tell them the spelling rule such as I before E <br/>\nexcept after C or When 2 vowels go a walking, the first one does the <br/>\ntalking, THEN tell them how to spell it. We use letter tiles to make <br/>\nup words. We play memory with words they have to match. One thing my <br/>\nkids LOVED was going to a graveyard with crayons and blank paper and <br/>\ndoing tombstone rubbings where they placed the paper on a graveyard <br/>\nstone and used the crayon to bring out the name onto paper. We make <br/>\nwords out of homemade playdough. A family game is to give each person <br/>\na letter (the letters make up a whole word) the first person says My <br/>\nletter is T, it sounds like Tih, the second person my letter is r it <br/>\nsounds like rrrrrrr, the third person e, the fourth person my letter <br/>\nis e it sounds like eeeeeeeeee the word is Tree.( this game was <br/>\nactually taken off of a Little House on the Prairie to teach a boy to <br/>\nread however it works great for spelling too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay this is all the things I can think of that we all play as games <br/>\nand my kids enjoy .
