My problem is IN the home differences. Tim&#39;s got the idea of no sweets right before dinner. 3 items on the dinner table at least. Dessert comes after a well balanced meal. His heart is for the children. He loves them and wants them to be healthy. He also is away all day, doesn&#39;t see the good food choices as often. He hears the request for sweets. I &quot;get&quot; freedom of food choices. I am frustrated having to stand up for the children&#39;s rights which put me and my hubby at odds with each other. So the compromise this week is not having sweets before dinner and trying to get more than mac and cheese on the table. I do usually cook very well, balanced meals made with wholesome ingredients. I&#39;m an organic farmer at heart, sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary h.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117956499,"authorName":"maryfhickman@jps.net","from":"maryfhickman@...","profile":"mfhickman95616","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: parents disagree","postDate":"1049818383","msgId":13336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0NTY2NzMuMTA0OTgxODM4MTAyMy5KYXZhTWFpbC5ub2JvZHlAbWlzc3BpZ2d5LnBzcC5wYXMuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13396,"prevInTime":13335,"nextInTime":13337,"topicId":13336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yesterday when driving to an activity, Riley was telling us that 60 minutes is an hour.

He then went on to ask about hours, days, weeks, months...Then asked how many days are in a year. I told him 365. He then asked if this was a D number. A what? a D number, mom, like thirDy, forDy,, fifDy...a D number , Mom. oh, yes Riley, 365 is in the hundreds and the 60 part is a D number. My 8 year old held her tongue too. Yipee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the whole parents not on the same plane, my relationship with Tim is important, so compromise it will be. Talking about the reality of food choices and family disease will be our focus. My mom is obese. Another reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n What also goes into play here is I am burned out with the providing of foods for the family. I am 1 of 5 and make 98 % of the meals for all of us, so help is also part of this. Menu planning, prep company, clean-up company. The bigger kids are reluctant to help. My 3 year old loves cooking so she is my mostly companion in the kitchen. Ashley did throw up her dinner that night. The ice-cream would not have stayed long in her body. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are an active, physical family, who hikes, bikes, gardens. I think this is equally important to health as our food choices. I use to have no &quot;junk&quot; in the house when the babes were little. What did they do at parties, go cookoo over chips, sodas, the like. So I started having all kinds of foods, to reduce the draw to the forbidden foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver all I think the kids do eat well. My 6 year old has a limited palette of food choices and is explosive. Finding protein foods that he likes is a constant struggle for me. I try to have him eat something with protein in the am. I often buy complete protein bread. He is a toast guy. He also craves sugar. He eats whole grains, loves them actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for talking about the reality of diabetes. I think Tim is right that the kids need to know about their family history and know food choices are important in maintaining health. I hope I can help him see his help on the issue will get the point across much better than telling me I am doing something terribly wrong. Tim is also know to go gaagaa over sweets. Hum... I think his health is important too, but will refrain from guiding his food choices for now. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13319,"nextTopicId":13333}}
