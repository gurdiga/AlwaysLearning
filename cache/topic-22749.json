We meet friends there and sometimes each of the kids brings along a neighborhood friend.  I pack snacks and beverages, so we don&#39;t need to buy the more expensive single serve stuff while out.  We vary the parks, as each has slightly different features.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur community has a free concert series in the park.  We were there Friday to listen to the music while the kids played/hung out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been more conscious of gas prices lately.  We took our annual trip to Moses Lake Family Aquatic center - an awesome water park with big slides, diving boards, sandy area, and more.  They allow food, so we always bring our own food and drink but the kids brought some money to buy a treat there too.  I spent $15 admission (for 3 people) and $12 gas.  Yikes!  Really cheap admission but not cheap gas...  It was a great day though.  We stayed for 5 hours and went as a group.  Five moms with their kids plus 5 more kids whose parents weren&#39;t able to come but between the other families we made room in our vehicles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand money being an issue, but most communities do have free or low cost things to do.  For instance, you can sometimes go at off hours for cheaper admission or find coupons for 2 for 1.  The park is free - you just have to get there.  Our local libraries have story and movie times for all ages, besides crafts and free movies and music (to check out), and, oh yeah, books :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWater balloons are pretty inexpensive and can make for a fun afternoon.  Sleep out in your backyard and star gaze.  This time of year summer toys are on clearance, even though the hot weather will continue for another month or two.  Slip n slide, wading pools, squirt guns.  Make popsicles from juice or kool aid.  Go for walks, skates, bike rides.  Start a lettuce garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Overwhelmed Already","postDate":"1121726444","msgId":22750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZiMGU2NjYxMmMwYTA2N2JkMjUwMGQ1NGI5YWM1NTFlQGNveC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRiaDBqZStjc29lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRiaDBqZStjc29lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22749,"nextInTopic":22751,"prevInTime":22749,"nextInTime":22751,"topicId":22749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We walk alot, go to the library, she comes with me when I work and helps if she can or reads if she can&#39;t. Since we began homeschooling she has become an avid reader. (She just turned 9.) We treat ourselves once a week to a visit to the swimming pool at a nearby hotel. We also cook together. I include her in the every day chores rather than think of her as a separate class of person because she is a kid.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt took a little while for us to get used to being together all the time.
