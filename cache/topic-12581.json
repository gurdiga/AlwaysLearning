I think I want to try to <br/>\nget back to some kind of normal here, and am hoping a little <br/>\ndiscussion might help.  My son Sam fell through the ice at a local <br/>\npark while there with a friend and his family.  He left at 1:00 that <br/>\nafternoon and at 5:30 we recieved the phone call.  That was Jan. 19, <br/>\nand I&#39;m still trying to accept that he&#39;s not coming home.   I&#39;m not <br/>\nready to write about it yet.  I want to write a journal, but haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen able to put much down.<br/>\nWhat I do want to write about here is how absolutely grateful I have <br/>\nfelt about unschooling.  It was one of the first thoughts that came <br/>\ninto my mind when I started to be able to think again.  Thank God we <br/>\nfound this path.  Thank God not a minute was wasted.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nreligious, though I find myself in a state of transition when it <br/>\ncomes to my spirituality.  But I don&#39;t know who else to thank. <br/>\nThough I do want to thank all of you people who have helped me on <br/>\nthis journey.  I don&#39;t need to explain here what I mean by all of <br/>\nthis.  We know what we&#39;re doing here when it comes to giving our <br/>\nchildren real lives.  Lives spent full of joy and wonder.  That&#39;s how <br/>\nSam has been described over and over.  Full of joy.<br/>\nOur whole town came out in support of us.  It was beautiful and <br/>\noverwhelming.  I&#39;m still getting it.<br/>\nWe recieved donations and we&#39;re taking our time, but we want to give <br/>\nin him name through the years.  While many people are on a campaign <br/>\nto try to prevent tragedies like this from happening again, I keep <br/>\ncoming to the thought of trying to find a way to help parents really <br/>\nunderstand how precious every minute is with their children.  <br/>\nAppreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>\nadvantage of the now. <br/>\nI have 3 other children and life is moving forward.  We still find <br/>\nlots of joy in it.  Our picture is in the photos section here if you <br/>\nwant to see Sammy, (or any of us).<br/>\nI wrote this here because this is the most peaceful and wise list I <br/>\nknow of.  I want to express my thanks and remind the people who have <br/>\nselflessly given of their time and wisdom over the years just how<br/>\nimportant they are.  You changed my life and you helped to make Sams <br/>\nlife so worthwhile and meaningful and full of joy.<br/>\nI wrote this without crying, and am not looking for condolences.<br/>\nJust giving thanks and maybe creating some discussion of how lucky we <br/>\nall are to unschool.
