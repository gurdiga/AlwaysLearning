Does <br/>\nshe want money for her own expenses? Is she afraid that if she gets <br/>\na job she will have to move and lose you guys? Help her by creating <br/>\na concrete list and plan, a timetable for those goals. When she <br/>\nachieves one celebrate with her. When she fails at meeting a goal, <br/>\nperhaps she needs to choose a new one, maybe that goal is not one <br/>\nshe really wants. So then what is it she wants and how can that <br/>\nhappen?

I had her from 2-6, <br/>\nand then only partial time (visits) until she was 16.  She was in an <br/>\nindependent study HS, which is different than regular school, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s still not Unschooling.

She also was 16 <br/>\nwhen she came to live here full time, not an adult then.  But she is <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is she depressed?

But we do pay for a cell phone and she calls, or <br/>\nthey call her, during her free time on that phone.

I did offer classes, in case she wasn&#39;t <br/>\ncomfortable learning from me, but she said no.  Classes also cost a <br/>\ngood deal of money we cannot really afford when there is a free <br/>\noption of us teaching her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You could say &quot;You&#39;re not fulfilling your contract; it&#39;s the same <br/>\n&gt;as not paying your rent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed I could do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Will her parents help you pay for this stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL....no.  Her parents and I have not been on speaking terms for <br/>\nyears.  They don&#39;t have the means to help her, or the inclination.  <br/>\nShe comes from an abusive background, and partly that was why I was <br/>\ntrying not to press too much.  But so what?  So do I (come from an <br/>\nabusive background) and no one carried me like she&#39;s being carried <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not &quot;her room,&quot; if your computer and desk are there. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We were calling it the library, or the computer room, but she <br/>\npersists in calling it her room, and in teaching the boys to call it <br/>\nher room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t  go along with what you&#39;re going along with if it were <br/>\n </span></blockquote>me.  Let her find some out of the way corner to sleep in if she <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wants to sleep late.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;s a light sleeper (rolling my eyes.)  As it is she complains <br/>\nabout the noise the boys make in the mornings, just being boys.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother to try to keep them quiet much, but it makes me feel <br/>\ntense knowing that she&#39;s trying to sleep when they&#39;re noisy and that <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be irritated about it.  Not that she cows me, I just don&#39;t <br/>\nlike the tension, and that makes me tense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope you said no, no way.

It would be the same as if <br/>\nI adopted her, or had shared custody of her when she was younger and <br/>\nthen full custody as a teen.  I do agree with you though.  I think <br/>\nshe&#39;s a lot younger developmentally than her chronological age.  <br/>\nStrange, but she used to be more self sufficient, more motivated and <br/>\nmore mature.  She fought to get her own placement into that <br/>\nindependent study school.  She used to help a lot more around here.  <br/>\nShe seems to be regressing, and I have been thinking that being in <br/>\nour safe home hads allowed her to be the carefree younger teen she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get the chance to be before.  She was primary caretaker for <br/>\nher twin sisters, who are Thomas&#39; age, because her parents were drug <br/>\naddicts.  It&#39;s gotten to the point though, where we feel it&#39;s just <br/>\nall too much, and she&#39;s taking advantage of us.  She wants to act <br/>\nlike a child now, but have adult perogatives and priveleges (sp?), <br/>\nand get respect while not giving it in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119145590,"authorName":"April","from":"&quot;April&quot; &lt;abmorris23@...&gt;","profile":"klkb624","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Help!

Lazy Teen?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOur 19 year old Nicole (will be 20 in spring) seems to<br/>\nbe lazy, or depressed or something.  She is fairly<br/>\nnon-communicative, even when asked direct questions,<br/>\nso it&#39;s hard for us to know what&#39;s going on with her<br/>\ninside.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wants to be treated as an adult but is overly<br/>\nsensative and emotional and difficult to talk to about<br/>\nthings and doesn&#39;t act as a responsible adult.  She<br/>\nhad moved out and lived with a boyfriend for a while,<br/>\nbut has been back home about a year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t have any friends or any social life<br/>\noutside of online and her cell phone, all long<br/>\ndistance people mainly met online.  She did an<br/>\nindependent study highschool in California (We&#39;re in<br/>\nWA, she&#39;s actually my neice) and accellerated herself<br/>\nto graduate early (at 16) so that she could move up<br/>\nhere and be with us.  She had been with us part time<br/>\nuntil then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole spends long hours at night on the computer<br/>\nplaying online games with people, until about 4 in the<br/>\nmorning.  She seems addicted to them to me.  She also<br/>\nspends long hours during the day on her cell phone<br/>\ntalking mostly to a guy she met online (27yrs) who<br/>\nlives in Texas.  He came and visited her here last<br/>\nmonth for about a week, and she&#39;s been having a long<br/>\ndistance relationships with him for about a year now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t take the public transit despite much urging<br/>\nand encouragement from us.  So her grandparents bought<br/>\nher a used car but despite our encouragement she&#39;s<br/>\nshown little interest in learning to drive it.  She<br/>\nhad high honors in school and that combined with being<br/>\nlow income and minority makes her elligible for grants<br/>\nfor school if she chooses to go to college but<br/>\nalthough she&#39;s looked into the local schools a little,<br/>\nshe has not persued that option.  She has had one job<br/>\ninterview and that was one I initiated for her (not to<br/>\npush her, I just circumstantially stumbled upon an<br/>\nunadvertised position with someone I know that seemed<br/>\nperfect for Nicole, who had said when asked that she<br/>\nwas interested in getting a job, so I put them in<br/>\ntouch with each other.)  She shows no interest in<br/>\nmoving out and getting her own place either.  She<br/>\nabsolutely not interested in moving to Texas either,<br/>\nbut would like to move her guy here to live in her<br/>\ncabin with her when it&#39;s completed.  He&#39;s currently<br/>\nunemployed, having been fired from a gas station store<br/>\njob, and lives with his mother and brother.  In his<br/>\ndefense, he is a really nice guy, but lacking in<br/>\nambition and self confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t do much of anything around the house, just<br/>\nher own laundry and some of her own cooking.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually clean up after she cooks or eats. <br/>\nDishes are suposed to be her main chore, because I<br/>\nhave psoriasis in my hands and it&#39;s something I can&#39;t<br/>\ndo much of.  She chose dishes and claimed to enjoy<br/>\ndoing them, but she complains about doing the dishes,<br/>\nand only does them once or twice a week, forcing Tom<br/>\nand I to tackle the piles out of desperation the rest<br/>\nof the time, which is at least twice a day.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried making a general list of other chores that need<br/>\ndone and asking her to pick some things off of it to<br/>\ndo, but that didn&#39;t work either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got her two cats (which she desperately wanted) and<br/>\nall their accoutrements and pay for vet and food for<br/>\nthem, but she has to be asked to change the litterbox<br/>\nwhen it stinks.  She also knows we are extremely tight<br/>\nfinancially but she has never offered to give up her<br/>\nonline games, which have monthly fees which we pay, or<br/>\nto give up other treats we buy for her (like drinking<br/>\nsoda) to offset the cost of her game.  We give her<br/>\npocket money to spend whenever we can afford to, and<br/>\noften get her little things (food treats, or other<br/>\npersonal items) just as we do with the younger kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer bedroom must be a public room during the day, as<br/>\nwe live in a very small space, and we made an 8pm<br/>\ncerfew for her room for everyone else to get out so<br/>\nthat she could have it to herself in the evenings. <br/>\nThe computers are in her room, as well as my sewing<br/>\nthings and my writing desk and other things we need<br/>\naccess to, yet she doesn&#39;t rise and leave her room<br/>\nuntil 12-2pm each day.  She will also often go into<br/>\nher room periodically between those times (2 and 8pm)<br/>\nand shut the door to talk on her phone or be alone for<br/>\na while.  She knew when she moved here that we had<br/>\nvery little space but were happy to share what we had,<br/>\nhowever now she seems to want to have that room all to<br/>\nherself, all the time, despite anyone else&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also seems to avoid spending time with us, playing<br/>\ngames or talking or being social with us, (unless<br/>\nthere is a power outage and she can&#39;t use the<br/>\ncomputer) and when she sits at the table in the<br/>\nkitchen coloring/drawing or reading or doing a puzzle<br/>\nor something she puts on headphones and hides her face<br/>\nwith her hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas is celebrating his 9th birthday this Thursday<br/>\nand two families who are friends of ours are coming<br/>\nover for a suppertime small party.  That&#39;s three extra<br/>\nkids and two extra adults.  She asked if she could<br/>\nlock herself in her room and make it off limits to the<br/>\nkids while that was ongoing.  Not only did she not<br/>\nwant to participate and be here for a family birthday<br/>\nparty, but she wanted to make one of the 4 rooms in<br/>\nthe house (not counting the bathroom there&#39;s the<br/>\nkitchin, living room, and two bedrooms) unavailable<br/>\nwhile we had extra people in the house.  We were<br/>\nanticipating being able to split the kids up to play<br/>\nif needed with some of them playing computer games in<br/>\nthat room if they wnated to.  While I was explaining<br/>\nthe difficulty of this and why it didn&#39;t seem a good<br/>\nidea to do that, she interrupted to say angrily &quot;I<br/>\nknew it wouldn&#39;t be alright.  Tom can you take me to<br/>\nthe library at that time?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been building her a studio cabin so that she<br/>\ncan have a little place of her own and we can all have<br/>\nmore space and privacy until out main house is built,<br/>\nbut although she&#39;s excited about it, she&#39;s done very<br/>\nlittle work on it herself and has left it mainly to<br/>\nus, despite much encouragement from us.  We live in a<br/>\ntwo bedroom single wide right now and Tom and I gave<br/>\nher our bedroom when she moved here at 16.  We sleep<br/>\non a loft we built in the room with the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to try to sit down and talk to her (again)<br/>\ntonight about some of the things that have been<br/>\nbothering us.  I guess I partly needed to vent and<br/>\npartly to ask the advice of an unschooling crowd on<br/>\nthis matter.  I can easily get the standard kind of<br/>\ndisrespectful parenting advice, but I&#39;m wondering what<br/>\nto do about this situation from an unschooly point of<br/>\nview and looking for advice from the good minds here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t want to drive her away.  We&#39;re feeling taken<br/>\nadvantage of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

Jon and <br/>\nhis girlfriend Abby are staying in my studio, but I  have to insist that they <br/>\nboth work jobs and give me money out of every check, to  pay back some money <br/>\nthey owe me.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are free to go at any time, being adults and all, but they choose to  <br/>\nstay.  They stay knowing that if they don&#39;t get up for work on time I will  wake <br/>\nthem.  If they call in sick and I don&#39;t see evidence of illness they  know <br/>\nthat I will ask them about it.  They know that as long as they owe me  money and <br/>\nare working to pay me back that I&#39;ll be happy to have them around and  help <br/>\nthem make good decisions and lend my tools to work on their cars and I&#39;ll  wash <br/>\ntowels and cook supper and invite them to eat, and let them put stuff in my  <br/>\nfridge.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my son came back I woke him up every day, cheerfully, and showed him  <br/>\nthe help wanted ads that I had seen that day.  I reassured him that I was  going <br/>\nto let him sleep and sleep and sleep all he wanted--between shifts.   I let <br/>\nhim know that what I cook he&#39;s free to eat and if there&#39;s something he  wants <br/>\nfrom the grocery that I&#39;ll keep it stocked.  But he&#39;s going to have  to work, <br/>\nor look for work.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThey&#39;re free to leave any time they want.  They choose to stay because  they <br/>\nknow it&#39;s the quickest way to pay the money back and they don&#39;t want to owe  <br/>\nit.  They want to be independent again and move to Florida near her family,  <br/>\nwhere they both have jobs waiting.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut still I have to wake them up 2 or 3 times a week, and I&#39;m not going to  <br/>\nkeep quiet when they call in sick and I know they&#39;re not sick.  They&#39;re  <br/>\nlacking in maturity and self-motivation in some ways.  They&#39;d rather do the  fun <br/>\nthings than the hard things.  I understand.  I was like that,  too.  But if I <br/>\nthought they were taking advantage of me, I&#39;d ask them to  leave.<br/>\n <br/>\nI keep imagining them as good friends who are hard on their luck.   Would I <br/>\nask Steve and Stacy to leave if they were taking advantage of me?   Yes.  Would <br/>\nI wake up Steve and Stacy if I knew they had to be at work by 8  and it was <br/>\n7:30 already?  Yes.  Would I cook food and stock their  favorites?  Yes, but <br/>\nonly if they were working.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;d treat my son this way if he had not already left  home.  <br/>\nOur family has made large adjustments to being just 3 of us, and it  is an <br/>\nadjustment to put someone back in the mix (two someones, one we didn&#39;t  know well). <br/>\n I&#39;ve made mention to others that it seems they both need a  little more <br/>\n&quot;browning in the oven&quot; before they can be out on their own again,  and I&#39;m willing <br/>\nto do that for them.

She is fairly<br/>\nnon-communicative, even when asked direct questions,<br/>\nso it&#39;s hard for us to know what&#39;s going on with her<br/>\ninside.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wants to be treated as an adult but is overly<br/>\nsensative and emotional and difficult to talk to about<br/>\nthings and doesn&#39;t act as a responsible adult.  She<br/>\nhad moved out and lived with a boyfriend for a while,<br/>\nbut has been back home about a year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t have any friends or any social life<br/>\noutside of online and her cell phone, all long<br/>\ndistance people mainly met online.  She did an<br/>\nindependent study highschool in California (We&#39;re in<br/>\nWA, she&#39;s actually my neice) and accellerated herself<br/>\nto graduate early (at 16) so that she could move up<br/>\nhere and be with us.  She had been with us part time<br/>\nuntil then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole spends long hours at night on the computer<br/>\nplaying online games with people, until about 4 in the<br/>\nmorning.  She seems addicted to them to me.  She also<br/>\nspends long hours during the day on her cell phone<br/>\ntalking mostly to a guy she met online (27yrs) who<br/>\nlives in Texas.  He came and visited her here last<br/>\nmonth for about a week, and she&#39;s been having a long<br/>\ndistance relationships with him for about a year now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t take the public transit despite much urging<br/>\nand encouragement from us.  So her grandparents bought<br/>\nher a used car but despite our encouragement she&#39;s<br/>\nshown little interest in learning to drive it.  She<br/>\nhad high honors in school and that combined with being<br/>\nlow income and minority makes her elligible for grants<br/>\nfor school if she chooses to go to college but<br/>\nalthough she&#39;s looked into the local schools a little,<br/>\nshe has not persued that option.  She has had one job<br/>\ninterview and that was one I initiated for her (not to<br/>\npush her, I just circumstantially stumbled upon an<br/>\nunadvertised position with someone I know that seemed<br/>\nperfect for Nicole, who had said when asked that she<br/>\nwas interested in getting a job, so I put them in<br/>\ntouch with each other.)  She shows no interest in<br/>\nmoving out and getting her own place either.  She<br/>\nabsolutely not interested in moving to Texas either,<br/>\nbut would like to move her guy here to live in her<br/>\ncabin with her when it&#39;s completed.  He&#39;s currently<br/>\nunemployed, having been fired from a gas station store<br/>\njob, and lives with his mother and brother.  In his<br/>\ndefense, he is a really nice guy, but lacking in<br/>\nambition and self confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t do much of anything around the house, just<br/>\nher own laundry and some of her own cooking.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually clean up after she cooks or eats. <br/>\nDishes are suposed to be her main chore, because I<br/>\nhave psoriasis in my hands and it&#39;s something I can&#39;t<br/>\ndo much of.  She chose dishes and claimed to enjoy<br/>\ndoing them, but she complains about doing the dishes,<br/>\nand only does them once or twice a week, forcing Tom<br/>\nand I to tackle the piles out of desperation the rest<br/>\nof the time, which is at least twice a day.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried making a general list of other chores that need<br/>\ndone and asking her to pick some things off of it to<br/>\ndo, but that didn&#39;t work either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got her two cats (which she desperately wanted) and<br/>\nall their accoutrements and pay for vet and food for<br/>\nthem, but she has to be asked to change the litterbox<br/>\nwhen it stinks.  She also knows we are extremely tight<br/>\nfinancially but she has never offered to give up her<br/>\nonline games, which have monthly fees which we pay, or<br/>\nto give up other treats we buy for her (like drinking<br/>\nsoda) to offset the cost of her game.  We give her<br/>\npocket money to spend whenever we can afford to, and<br/>\noften get her little things (food treats, or other<br/>\npersonal items) just as we do with the younger kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer bedroom must be a public room during the day, as<br/>\nwe live in a very small space, and we made an 8pm<br/>\ncerfew for her room for everyone else to get out so<br/>\nthat she could have it to herself in the evenings. <br/>\nThe computers are in her room, as well as my sewing<br/>\nthings and my writing desk and other things we need<br/>\naccess to, yet she doesn&#39;t rise and leave her room<br/>\nuntil 12-2pm each day.  She will also often go into<br/>\nher room periodically between those times (2 and 8pm)<br/>\nand shut the door to talk on her phone or be alone for<br/>\na while.  She knew when she moved here that we had<br/>\nvery little space but were happy to share what we had,<br/>\nhowever now she seems to want to have that room all to<br/>\nherself, all the time, despite anyone else&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also seems to avoid spending time with us, playing<br/>\ngames or talking or being social with us, (unless<br/>\nthere is a power outage and she can&#39;t use the<br/>\ncomputer) and when she sits at the table in the<br/>\nkitchen coloring/drawing or reading or doing a puzzle<br/>\nor something she puts on headphones and hides her face<br/>\nwith her hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas is celebrating his 9th birthday this Thursday<br/>\nand two families who are friends of ours are coming<br/>\nover for a suppertime small party.  That&#39;s three extra<br/>\nkids and two extra adults.  She asked if she could<br/>\nlock herself in her room and make it off limits to the<br/>\nkids while that was ongoing.  Not only did she not<br/>\nwant to participate and be here for a family birthday<br/>\nparty, but she wanted to make one of the 4 rooms in<br/>\nthe house (not counting the bathroom there&#39;s the<br/>\nkitchin, living room, and two bedrooms) unavailable<br/>\nwhile we had extra people in the house.  We were<br/>\nanticipating being able to split the kids up to play<br/>\nif needed with some of them playing computer games in<br/>\nthat room if they wnated to.  While I was explaining<br/>\nthe difficulty of this and why it didn&#39;t seem a good<br/>\nidea to do that, she interrupted to say angrily &quot;I<br/>\nknew it wouldn&#39;t be alright.  Tom can you take me to<br/>\nthe library at that time?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been building her a studio cabin so that she<br/>\ncan have a little place of her own and we can all have<br/>\nmore space and privacy until out main house is built,<br/>\nbut although she&#39;s excited about it, she&#39;s done very<br/>\nlittle work on it herself and has left it mainly to<br/>\nus, despite much encouragement from us.  We live in a<br/>\ntwo bedroom single wide right now and Tom and I gave<br/>\nher our bedroom when she moved here at 16.  We sleep<br/>\non a loft we built in the room with the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to try to sit down and talk to her (again)<br/>\ntonight about some of the things that have been<br/>\nbothering us.  I guess I partly needed to vent and<br/>\npartly to ask the advice of an unschooling crowd on<br/>\nthis matter.  I can easily get the standard kind of<br/>\ndisrespectful parenting advice, but I&#39;m wondering what<br/>\nto do about this situation from an unschooly point of<br/>\nview and looking for advice from the good minds here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t want to drive her away.
