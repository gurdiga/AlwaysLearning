All that part is nicely phrased.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two points to make for your future writings and thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My middle child has never been to school or even attempted anything  <br/>\nremotely resembling school; yet, at 7 he can read because he wanted  <br/>\nto.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can read because he was developmentally able to read.  Wanting to  <br/>\nread doesn&#39;t enable reading.  Many seven year olds want to read but  <br/>\naren&#39;t ready yet (especially boys).  Many four year olds would LOVE to  <br/>\nread, but very few are going to figure it out at that age, with or  <br/>\nwithout help.  The danger of having statements like that out there an  <br/>\nunchallenged is that some unschooling family with a seven or eight  <br/>\nyear old who isn&#39;t reading might say &quot;unschooling doesn&#39;t work because  <br/>\nmy child wants to read and can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is more minor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;At this point I opened up my mind to the thoughts of unschooling and  <br/>\nstarted reading book after book about it.  I realized that I needed to  <br/>\nthrow away conventional thinking and open up my mind to the  <br/>\npossibility that what I thought of as learning may not be the only  <br/>\npath to knowledge.   My discovery took place because of pioneers:  <br/>\nHolt, Gatto, Kohn, and Sandra Dodd.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGatto and Kohn don&#39;t write about unschooling.  So their books are  <br/>\nlinked there but they&#39;re neither about unschooling.  Not that they  <br/>\nwon&#39;t help people move toward it; they can.  Just as a technicality,  <br/>\nthough...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161610102,"authorName":"Mary Hickcox","from":"Mary Hickcox &lt;disser420@...&gt;","profile":"DISSER420","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Journey to unschooling","postDate":"1285980584","msgId":57571,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMDQyMS41NTgxNC5xbUB3ZWIxMTE0MTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57572,"prevInTime":57570,"nextInTime":57572,"topicId":57571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://www.activistpost.com/2010/10/journey-to-unschooling.html Please feel free to comment or send feedback:) Mary  mama to Dylan (11), Colin (7) and Theo","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-439376878\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2010/10/journey-to-unschooling.html\">http://www.activistpost.com/2010/10/journey-to-unschooling.html</a><br/>\nPlease feel free to comment or send feedback:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMary  mama to Dylan (11), Colin (7) and Theo Benjamin (3)  <br/>\n&quot;Be who you want your children to be.&quot;    Unknown  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57496,"nextTopicId":57477}}
