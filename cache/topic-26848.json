How<br/>\ndid I make unschooling work in my family?  I let go!  I let go of all of the<br/>\nold tapes running through my head of how things are *supposed* to be and<br/>\njust let them be what they are.  I started to change in myself what could be<br/>\nchanged... what I felt I should change... what needed to grow.  I stopped<br/>\ntrying to micro-manage my family.  I stopped trying to change them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI looked at the beauty in the world around me... knowing that there are<br/>\nstill some thorns and to watch where I step.  I choose everyday to look at<br/>\nthe world through different lenses... different lenses than most people wear<br/>\n  I choose to trust... my DD, my DH, myself... I choose to trust the process<br/>\nthat learning is organic and that we will get what we need when we need it. <br/>\nI choose to trust my creator and live to bring peace, love, and joy to the<br/>\nworld around me.  I choose to be proactive not reactive to my world.  I<br/>\nchoose to reply to people with love and not anger.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDH still struggles a bit with letting go of the control... so I gently<br/>\nremind him to trust our DD and to be there for her and talk to her about her<br/>\nworld.  Not to control her world for her.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI look to other unschoolers who have *been-there-done-that* and take their<br/>\nexample and apply it to my life... knowing that they are off the beaten path<br/>\nbut they are way more grounded and living a much more beautiful and full<br/>\nlife than the rest of the world that I see.  I take their opinions about my<br/>\nhang-ups and really try to see their POV... if I took it personally (like I<br/>\nve seen too many people do), I wouldn&#39;t be able to *get it* and apply it to<br/>\nmy life.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://the3lboutique.has.it\">http://the3lboutique.has.it</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26844,"nextTopicId":26855}}
