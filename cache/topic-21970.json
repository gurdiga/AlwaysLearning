We had a &quot;rec room&quot; in the basement  when I <br/>\nwas a kid.  Lots of room for lounging about, and so the whole family  spent <br/>\nSaturday nights down there watching TV and drifting off to sleep after the  news <br/>\n(no one wanted to wake up enough to get up and turn the TV off, so I would  <br/>\noften wake up when the &quot;ant races&quot; came on).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI remember one time, when I was about 9.  It was springtime, and we  had all <br/>\nbeen out doing stuff all day, playing or working in the yard.  The  house was <br/>\ncleaned up and I was freshly washed.  Dad asked me to go upstairs  and adjust <br/>\nthe thermostat, something I&#39;d never done before.  I was proud  that he asked <br/>\nme to do something important and just for adults, but I was scared  to DEATH.  <br/>\nI said I didn&#39;t want to.  He cajoled me into it, and it was  obvious my <br/>\nbrothers weren&#39;t going to budge.  I finally opened the basement  door, flipped on <br/>\nthe hall light, looked up the stairs for a second...I KNEW my  family was <br/>\nwatching to see if I would run.  I took a deep breath and  started up the stairs at <br/>\nkid-pace, but not running.  Turned the corner at  the middle landing and RAN <br/>\nthe rest of the way to the thermostat just at the top  of the stairs.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI stood there, breathing heavily, and remembered the instructions.  I  <br/>\nadjusted it just like Dad told me to do.  Proud of myself for doing it  &quot;just <br/>\nright&quot;, I took a deep breath in appreciation of the heat coming  on.  Then, I <br/>\nrealized I wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  I stood there at the  top of the stairs, took a <br/>\nlook around the living room, flipped off the light and  walked calmly down the <br/>\nstairs.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy pride had overcome my fear.  <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bed time","postDate":"1113222848","msgId":21993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhlLjI1MWNhZjE1LjJmOGJjOGMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21990,"nextInTopic":21994,"prevInTime":21992,"nextInTime":21994,"topicId":21970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/2005 6:49:49 AM Central Standard Time, woodjmac3@wanadoo.fr writes: My  concern is that they were both tired but did not say and would","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1292956214\">In a message dated 4/9/2005 6:49:49 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:woodjmac3@...\">woodjmac3@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy  concern is that they were both tired but did not say and would Craig <br/>\nwould  have stayed up just to not go to bed without me.

Mostly I needed the<br/>\nsupport to let go of my fear for him and his future and the pull to<br/>\nsubscribe to everyone else&#39;s ideas of what we should do for him. There was<br/>\nvaluable information for us on the internet and from those who had similar<br/>\nsituations, but it still came down to what his needs were, which many times<br/>\nwere not at all what the &quot;professionals&quot; said they were. As far as sleeping<br/>\ngoes, he has evolved into a 16 yo who sometimes stays up all night working<br/>\non his passions, and sometimes crashes at 7pm and sleeps till morning. It<br/>\nseems to have worked to let him be himself, even though that is very<br/>\ndifferent from his siblings. He has figured out through experience that if<br/>\nhe has to do something the next morning, he has to go to sleep by a certain<br/>\ntime. I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have gotten that if I implemented his schedule for<br/>\nhim. I did read every night at bedtime when they were younger, and he did<br/>\nsettle in better with that routine, and definitely had difficulty with<br/>\nchange, and so we had to work with those things. It hasn&#39;t been a clean-cut<br/>\nexperience. It can look and feel messy, or sometimes seem like it takes<br/>\nforever for there to be a positive result from trusting the process of<br/>\nfreedom for him. But I have to say that he has grown in leaps and bounds by<br/>\nbeing able to completely indulge in his passions. He&#39;s learned most things<br/>\nin life (including about relationships, body language, innuendo, etc., the<br/>\nareas that are his biggest challenges) from  having the freedom to do what<br/>\nhe wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a family, we still have to make compromises for the needs of each<br/>\nindividual (as the last poster said). My daughter entered school in the 7th<br/>\ngrade this year (her choice) and has to get up early. We have all agreed to<br/>\nbe quiet near her room by 9:30 at night. My autistic son&#39;s room is the<br/>\nfarthest from the other bedrooms which gives him the freedom to have his<br/>\nsleep/work schedule.

I learned that I needed to stop expecting that anything was<br/>\ngoing to happen the way I wanted it to. Seemed the moment I wanted something<br/>\nto go a certain way with my children was the beginning of my time of<br/>\nresentment, frustration, irritability, and lousy mothering. Most of my<br/>\nfrustrations were built around what I thought was supposed to happen (i.e.,<br/>\nkids have a bedtime and should sleep in their own rooms) based on societal<br/>\nnorms, even ones I didn&#39;t buy into, and even though my experience with my<br/>\nchildren told me differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you limit what YOU want out of bedtime, and see what<br/>\nthey need during bedtime. If they want to go to bed and want you with them,<br/>\nbut you have something you wanted to watch on TV or something you wanted to<br/>\ndo, then record what you wanted to see, or postpone what you want to do. I<br/>\nknow this may seem confining, and other people may have other suggestions,<br/>\nbut it is what I found to be necessary. Raising children was a big purging<br/>\nsession for me. I found myself often letting go of desires, ideas, etc. When<br/>\nI felt frustrated I learned to ask the question, &quot;What do I WANT that is<br/>\ncausing me to be frustrated right now&quot; and I usually found that I wanted to<br/>\nsee a show on TV, or quietly read the next paragraph of a book, or go to<br/>\nsleep with everyone else going to sleep at the same time, or go to the<br/>\nbathroom alone. Once I figured out my want, it was easier to let go of it,<br/>\nor reconfigure it so that I would get something of what I wanted in a<br/>\ndifferent way or at a different time. Having my children&#39;s needs come first<br/>\nwas the priority. And I think this is much of what parenting is supposed to<br/>\nbe about. And then comes the part where you put joy into these &quot;sacrifices&quot;.<br/>\nI think you are right that the children know you are resentful, so the<br/>\nsooner you let that go and enjoy this part of your day together, the better<br/>\nyour evenings will go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does bring up the bigger picture of how we as parents (figurative &quot;we&quot;)<br/>\ncame to think that our desires come before our kids needs. It is not only<br/>\ncommon occurrence in this country, we are drilled to be &quot;independent&quot; and to<br/>\nmake our kids that way too by ignoring their needs and showing how we go for<br/>\nours. (Not speaking about the poster btw, I think we&#39;ve all had some of the<br/>\nexperience you present, just talking about how we got here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast thought: For us, bedtime gradually evolved. They got a little older and<br/>\nspread out a little more, and went to sleepovers at friends&#39; houses, and<br/>\nliked to have their own space, and I&#39;m sure it happens differently for<br/>\ndifferent families, but for us our 16, 15 and 12 yo sleep mostly in their<br/>\nown rooms now, though I do get pleasant surprises in the middle of the night<br/>\nstill (and I LOVE those times) and my 11 yo still sleeps with me and waits<br/>\nfor me to go to bed, or falls asleep wherever he is. He still has friends<br/>\nsleep over and sleeps in his room with them and he happily sleeps over<br/>\nfriends&#39; houses. I&#39;m just grateful at this point for any time that we have<br/>\ntogether, even snuggling at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bed time","postDate":"1112966186","msgId":21973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0LjUyYTRmMGE1LjJmODdkZTJhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21970,"nextInTopic":21974,"prevInTime":21972,"nextInTime":21974,"topicId":21970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/7/2005 1:33:16 PM Central Standard Time, woodjmac3@wanadoo.fr writes: would  like them to feel secure about going upstairs on their own or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2080239835\">In a message dated 4/7/2005 1:33:16 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:woodjmac3@...\">woodjmac3@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nwould  like them to feel secure about going upstairs on their own or with <br/>\njust one of  us so do not make any comments verbally but I am sure they must pick <br/>\nup on my  non verbal messages.
