So, they always held back.  My dad never held my hand, never told me he loved me.  My mom never cuddled with me, never told me I was too good at anything.  As a result, I have always (until recently) lived in fear of spoiling somehow. Consequently, I have always (again, until recently) held back kindness to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was five or so, and I was laying with him one night.  He loves to cuddle.  That night, I chose to swap places with him.  I chose to imagine that I was him, and that it was my mom cuddling with me like I had always wished for, but dared not ask.  I felt my own warmth and love, and I filled up to the brim with it.  To my delight, I didn&#39;t turn rotten!  In fact, I turned more sweet.  For a good while after, I did this whenever I met a need of Ethan&#39;s.  As I pretended to be him, I let myself feel trusted, loved and supported in my needs.  I also looked at myself through his eyes, and saw a trustworthy, loving and supportive mom.  That was all very healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can almost feel the tears in your husband&#39;s eyes.  I was once convinced that we humans are inherently bad.  Early on, I was often told that I was spoiling my son--that he would become lazy and selfish because I indulged him too much.  Thankfully, I quietly ignored their warnings.  He is only nine, but he is quickly becoming one of the most motivated, generous people I have had the good fortune to know.   He has shown me the inherent goodness in people that shines brightest when they are trusted and supported.  He has shown me the goodness in myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m wondering...perhaps your husband needs to see and feel the goodness in himself through the eyes of you and your children.  Maybe, give him lots of extra love.  Point out all the good he brings to his family when he gives.  Add those things to your blog.  Maybe if he learns to trust himself again (without having to be locked in a closet) he will let go of his fear of ruin, and begin to trust his children more easily too.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261223738,"authorName":"Claire Darbaud","from":"Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt;","profile":"cdarbaud","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Dad&#39;s ideas... and talking to learn","postDate":"1325839057","msgId":64750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRzB1Vzhta2s4WT04NldWamtZNnRvejRXbzJiZ2hLaW1kQ0ttOVJGZEFSMlY9T0FKUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64751,"prevInTime":64749,"nextInTime":64751,"topicId":64750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband watched a very depressing documentary last night called my life without a diploma .

It was about young people who drop out of school<br/>\nwithout a diploma. They interviewed 4 teenagers who where saying how lost<br/>\nand anxious they felt and some were saying how badly they wanted to get<br/>\nback into school. The documentary said that in France alone, schools kicks<br/>\ngoodbye  223 000 kids every year...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, my husband turned to me: you see what you are doing to our kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see what schools does to kids. If anything, last night&#39;s documentary<br/>\nbrings water to my mill and convinces me that I really don&#39;t want to risk<br/>\nschool with my children. I tried to explain: these kids on TV, they<br/>\nactually went to school for at least 10 years! And that&#39;s what SCHOOL did<br/>\nto them: it convinced them they were good for nothing, gave them no time to<br/>\nexplore life and find their passion(s), it killed all the sparkle in their<br/>\nlives and eventually left them on the side of the road...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a touching scene with a yound man, meeting one of his &quot;old&quot;<br/>\nteacher on the street (pardon my engligh, I don&#39;t mean old as in a big age,<br/>\nI mean old as in the man had been his teacher several years before). The<br/>\nteacher asked how the young man was doing and the young man explained his<br/>\nstruggle, life in a constant job search, 2 days contracts after 2 days<br/>\ncontracts... The teacher was almost in tears and said he was sorry that<br/>\nschool had so badly failed him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked my husband, where did you see unschoolers in the documentary? How<br/>\ncan you take a doc about school&#39;s failures and use it as a proof that<br/>\nunschooling will not work? He said: that&#39;s what happens when kids don&#39;t go<br/>\nto school... He says he has seen a lot of kids who never went to school in<br/>\nMadagascar and they all end up on the street. I tried to explain we are not<br/>\nin Madagascar and that the kids he refers too where not &quot;unschooled&quot;, they<br/>\nwere working or begging from very early childhood and that unschooled kids<br/>\nget a lot of free time to learn and explore their passions and they thrive.<br/>\nHe said &quot;only in the States, it can&#39;t work in France&quot;. I got Andre Stern&#39;s<br/>\nbook out (a 40 year old french man who was very happily unschooled and grew<br/>\nup to be very successfull and wrote a book about it). He mumbled and turned<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my main question is can unschooling when the dad is convinced it<br/>\nwill not? He doesn&#39;t even want to try to understand what it is I am doing<br/>\nhere. He says so: it doesn&#39;t fit my thinking, I don&#39;t want to know :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason we&#39;re still unschooling is that he will not force the kids to go<br/>\nto school and they really don&#39;t want to go. And in his mind, that&#39;s nothing<br/>\nto do with school being an unfriendly place: it&#39;s my fault!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was a child, he didn&#39;t want to go to school. He escaped from school<br/>\nseveral times. I think he was about 4 or 5 when he last escaped and his dad<br/>\nlocked him in a dark room untill he agreed to go and promised he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nescape anymore.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI started a private blog exploring my kid&#39;s learning daily. He doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, I told him that I am getting more convinced, day after day of<br/>\nwatching how much they learn, that unschooling is the best choice. I said<br/>\nwhen they grow up to be successfull and thiving, I&#39;ll share the credit<br/>\n(thanks Sandra for that one, I love it). He almost had tears in his eyes<br/>\nand said &quot;I hope you&#39;re right, and you can keep the credit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nHEY... As I was writing, it just dawned on me! I am going to write to Andre<br/>\nStern and ask him if he would agree to talk to my husband. Guy to guy...!!<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am getting to the end of this email and it strikes me how writing it<br/>\nactually helped me. Wording my problem brings so much solution. In a talk<br/>\nabout his &quot;turning learning right side up&quot; book, Daniel Greenberg explains<br/>\nthat the first way people learn is by talking.  And then I read a book<br/>\nabout a young woman who was born completely deaf and had no access to<br/>\nlanguage until she discovered sign language when she was 7. She describes<br/>\nhow confused she was in her childhood. Not having words for things meant<br/>\nshe had no way to &quot;arrange them&quot; in her thinking. And in fact she couldn&#39;t<br/>\nreally &quot;think&quot; let alone communicate before she had a language and it was<br/>\nvery scary and miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this email I just worded out my stuff... and it&#39;s so much clearer now.<br/>\nWaohhh! I don&#39;t feel I need the list&#39;s advice anymore. And yet I would love<br/>\na discusion about how talking, or writing (as opposed to listening or<br/>\ngathering info) is central to learning. It feels like it&#39;s like accessing<br/>\nknowledge from within. I am very intrigued.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave some of you had this experience of writing an email to a list and by<br/>\nthe time you&#39;re done writing, you&#39;ve got your answer and don&#39;t need to send<br/>\nthe email?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64739,"nextTopicId":64713}}
