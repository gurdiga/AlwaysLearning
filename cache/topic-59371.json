How do I deal with this? What would the school do? Will we be in trouble? Really scared here. I really need lots of advice.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no way for those of us on-list to know what the school will do with respect to determining which grade level your boys will be put into. There&#39;s no way for us to know if you will be &quot;in trouble&quot;, however you may be defining that to yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list isn&#39;t for providing advice for taking kids from unschooling to public schooling. We can&#39;t allay your fears about what&#39;s going to happen with the school. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe CAN (and at least one person already has) provide ideas of ways to continue unschooling in spite of the loss of one parent&#39;s job. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===The boys are really scared and dont want to go===<br/>\n<br/>\nIs continuing to unschool open for consideration for your family, or is putting your boys in school the absolute *only* option available?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf continuing to unschool is open for consideration, that&#39;s one less big change for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf putting your boys in school is the only option, I would suggest gathering the information you need about doing that because that will help get *your* fear under control -- you can&#39;t effectively help your boys with that transition if you&#39;re full of fear about it yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if there&#39;s some way to continue unschooling, shift your focus on ways to make that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does your husband feel about unschooling? Is he willing to be the at-home parent while you&#39;re at work? Could the two of you work opposite shifts so that one of you can always be available to your boys?<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need advice in NJ, Please","postDate":"1296588912","msgId":59375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpOW45ZytzaWJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlpOWpvdCtmY2xtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59371,"nextInTopic":59378,"prevInTime":59374,"nextInTime":59376,"topicId":59371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is your husband willing to help you unschool while he looks for a new job?

One parent doesn&#39;t have to stay home full time in order to unschool, but both parents do need to be committed to keeping the kids out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it would be possible to juggle your schedules so that the boys don&#39;t have to go to school? A lot of families arrange for a parent to always be home so that they don&#39;t have to pay for daycare; it can work for older kids, too, to keep them out of school. Perhaps the boys will be willing to give up some classes and other extras (cable, internet, etc, if applicable) if that means being able to stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea Q<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jenjon1964&quot; &lt;barbaracartagena3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband got laid off work.
