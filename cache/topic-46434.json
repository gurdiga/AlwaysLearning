I live in Salem, MA with my wife, Kathryn Baptista,<br/>\nour almost 20 year old son, Julian and Sadel, 12, who has shared our lives<br/>\nfor the past 16 months and will be moving on to new adventures in a few<br/>\nweeks. We have unschooled Julian since he was 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am really looking forward to seeing many of you at the Northeast<br/>\nUnschooling Conference this August. Some of my favorite people in the whole<br/>\nworld will be there � the Lovejoys, the Kreams, the Davis-Pitres, Marji<br/>\nZintz, the Yablonski- Bieglers� and I am so looking forward to reconnecting<br/>\nwith old friends and making lots of new ones.<br/>\nI am especially excited about spending a few hours learning from Rue<br/>\nKream, wife of Jon and parent of Dagny and Rowan, unschooling guru and<br/>\nauthor of the book, �Parenting A Free Child: An Unschooled Life.� Any of you<br/>\nwho have met Rue, talked with her on the discussion boards, read her book,<br/>\nor admired her butt on the book�s front cover will share my awe at her<br/>\ngentle, kind wisdom and her unwavering commitment to parenting free children<br/>\nand supporting all of us to do so as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends, laughter, music, a great location just north of Boston, and a<br/>\nloving and welcoming community of people who share the unschooling lifestyle<br/>\n� I can�t think of a better way to spend the last few days of August.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit our website at www.northeastunschoolingconference.com for more<br/>\ninformation and to register.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to see you there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46426,"nextTopicId":46411}}
