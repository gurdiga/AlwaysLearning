She&#39;s willing to brush once a day, but doesn&#39;t like flossing. She will let me floss for her while she watches TV. Are there any incentives you can think of that would help your daughter more willingly brush and/or floss? Will she let you?<br/>\nMy son had pink eye one time. He hated for good reason the eye drop medicine. I paid him money each time we did it. He still fought me, just because it was instinctual but he was willing to let me hold his head still and eye lid open. <br/>\n<br/>\nXylitol gum is suppose to help prevent cavities. A dentist told me about this. I found a link below where there&#39;s information about the benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cda.org/popup/xylitol\">http://www.cda.org/popup/xylitol</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter uses the gum on her braces if they are bothering or cutting into her mouth. The gum is sitting right on the tooth and hopefully preventing cavities. <br/>\nChewing artificially sweetened gum even without xylitol is suppose to help clean teeth. It increase saliva and I&#39;m thinking... pulls food out of cracks.  The increase saliva is suppose to help prevent cavities. It might also help with bad breath. The xylitol can be an added benefit to the rest. Some gums might stick to braces, but I think the sugar free ones are OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion I have is to ask about the consequences of waiting on the braces. My teeth and my daughters would have been so bad as to make eating difficult, so it was more of a necessity early on. Your daughter might be able to wait till she&#39;s older. You might want to get a couple of opinions about that. <br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Need some help with encouraging  hygiene","postDate":"1289499453","msgId":58065,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5OTAzOC41ODM4MC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGliaDM4MytyZzR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGliaDM4MytyZzR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58064,"nextInTopic":58066,"prevInTime":58064,"nextInTime":58066,"topicId":58041,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The best use of xylitol for teeth is NOT drinking but having it either swish in te mouth for a few *minutes* or use some mint or gum so it stays in the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2031011775\">The best use of xylitol for teeth is NOT drinking but having it either swish in <br/>\nte mouth for a few *minutes* or use some mint or gum so it stays in the <br/>\nmouth for a while.<br/>\nDrinking it is NOT as good and some people are very sensitive  and can <br/>\ncause diarrhea and upset if not introduced slowly.<br/>\nThis needs to be done at least 5 times a day.<br/>\nYou can read more at xyitol.org<br/>\nI do highly recommend it for creating a environment in the mouth were the <br/>\nbacteria cannot survive.<br/>\nIt will certainly help people that does not like brushing.<br/>\nTwo websites with great gum and mint:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.epicdental.com/\">http://www.epicdental.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xlear.com/spry.aspx\">http://www.xlear.com/spry.aspx</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Having cavities is not  just not brushing and flossing.<br/>\nActually brushing and flossing does NOT guarantee cavity free teeth.<br/>\nI have done a lot of research on it for many years and my conclusion is that<br/>\nit is a combination of mouth environment (an acidic pH vs a neutral/alkaline ), <br/>\nthe presence <br/>\n<br/>\nof cavity causing bacteria, genes ( the biggest), health and nutrition, hygiene.<br/>\nBeing that diet and hygiene at  minor variables here if they even are!!!!<br/>\nTake someone , like my uncle or my husband&#39;s friend Gene.<br/>\nThe have very poor hygiene habits, never ever floss, eat sweets all the time, <br/>\none even smokes.<br/>\nOne is in his 60&#39;s and the other 40&#39;s.<br/>\nOne has ONE cavity and the other NONE.<br/>\n If their mouth environment is never acidic and their teeth and enamel super <br/>\nstrong because they were born that way than they have no problems.<br/>\nTake me that always brushed  and took great care of hygiene and did not like <br/>\ncandy and sweets as a child.<br/>\nI have cavities every where. <br/>\nActually taking to my dentist the other day I realized that my cavities pretty <br/>\nmuch stabilizd in my 20&#39;s.

My six year old had 10 cavities filled this year and my 2 year old had 4 and 2 &quot;watch spots&quot;.   Recently we bought a waterpik, which does about the same job as flossing, plus it is a great novelty for my older son.  Also, I read &quot;Kiss You Dentist Goodbye&quot; and started using Closys, an antibacterial mouth rinse.  The kids just swish it for 30 seconds and it is flavorless, but comes with peppermint oil (though I am sure you could put vanilla in there) to flavor it.  It makes me feel so much better that it is almost impossible to get the now 3 year old.  I feel like, as long as they swish, I can exhale my anger and frustration with the not brushing thing.  It enables me to let Sage brush his teeth the way he does it.  Oh, also the Closys does wonders for bad breath.

She denied them many times and by the age of 16 I had perfectly straight, white teeth all on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your daughter understand why she needs to brush and floss? That she needs to do it for herself, not just you and the dentist? Also, taking care of teeth isn&#39;t just about aesthetics, but about overall health. I&#39;d stress heart health, longevity and lay off the appearances and stuff about what others might think. Maybe she is feeling too much pressure. Maybe she wants them taken off so she&#39;s purposefully not caring for them. I&#39;d have a heart to heart with your daughter to figure out exactly how she&#39;s feeling. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I do with my son is I keep him company while he&#39;s brushing so he&#39;s not as bored. We used to have countdowns for mouthwash, too where I counted to 60 while he swished. He also has a toothbrush with built in timer. He likes the timed aspect of brushing b/c he has a definite end to the chore. I also offer to help him floss since he finds it difficult by himself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;miriam&quot; &lt;miriyum1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter (almost 12) and I have been unschooling for a little over a year.

I am not necessarily advocating that, specifically, but painful dental procedures, forced on a child, are what lead to dental phobias – I know so many adults with such phobias and I have NO such issues, even though I had extensive dental and orthodontic work done.

Trips to the dentist increased her sensitivity (not to  <br/>\nmention fear of anything being in her mouth). It&#39;s been difficult and  <br/>\nexpensive at times, but we&#39;ve found ways to keep her teeth as sound as  <br/>\npossible. This has included sedation and once, general anesthesia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been determined to find a dentist who will work with Senna and  <br/>\nher oral issues. It has been a long process, but I finally found one a  <br/>\ncouple of years ago (whom I am thrilled to see, too). He honors when  <br/>\nshe says stop, makes suggestions for alternatives to what he&#39;d like to  <br/>\ndo (he&#39;s very creative, has 6 kids himself), gives her space and talks  <br/>\nher language (he&#39;s a gamer and has a son into Pokemon &lt;g&gt;). She is  <br/>\nreally beginning to trust him to look after her. He was able to clean  <br/>\nher teeth and floss them yesterday, something she would never have  <br/>\nallowed a year ago. He has been so willing to work with us as a family  <br/>\nand I really appreciate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur dentist said that it would be a huge problem for Senna to have  <br/>\nbraces if she isn&#39;t ready to take care of her teeth. She isn&#39;t having  <br/>\nany bite issues or pain (which is the important thing for braces, not  <br/>\njust to straighten teeth). We see him every 3 months now for a  <br/>\nthorough cleaning and would do the sedation again, if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had ongoing conversations with Senna about the importance of  <br/>\nlooking after her teeth, what the consequences *could* be, and so on.   <br/>\nShe, too, is sensitive to criticism of her bad breath. It has not  <br/>\nhelped our relationship for me to harangue her about these things,  <br/>\nthough. She has dug in her heels as she has with anything I tried to  <br/>\nforce on her. Previously, I have put my worry for her health ahead of  <br/>\nfinding a way for her to trust me that someone won&#39;t hurt her.  As  <br/>\nproof that we&#39;re making headway, she got up after only six hours of  <br/>\nsleep to go to the dentist yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be up to my daughter to look after her teeth on her own  <br/>\neventually. I have finally been able to provide positive interactions  <br/>\nwith a dentist (too many talked in condescending sing-song voices or  <br/>\ngot mad if she refused treatment - they wouldn&#39;t have dared do that to  <br/>\nme). I expect she will eventually understand the importance of looking  <br/>\nafter her dental health more fully (probably when she finds someone to  <br/>\nkiss &lt;g&gt;).

She has never had good hygiene habits and I&#39;ve never been a big fusser over her cleaning routine since she&#39;s been big enough to do it for herself. She will clean herself up when I ask her to so that we can go in public without embarassment. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that she is wearing braces now (almost a year) and she does a very poor job of cleaning her teeth. She pretty much refuses to floss although I&#39;ve bought every imaginable tool to make it easier for her. She finds it awkward and boring and won&#39;t do it. Her breath is often foul even after brushing because she won&#39;t clean out the food and plaque caught between her teeth. I have now to take her in for 4 professional cleanings a year because of her poor hygiene. At the last tooth cleaning, which was painful for her (I heard her shout all the way in the waiting room -- shudder ---) the dentist came out and told me that if she didn&#39;t clean her teeth properly the braces wouldn&#39;t do their job. The orthodonist has said as much. They&#39;ve said this in front of her. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just about the only serious bone of contention between me and my daughter and the only time when I really feel like I&#39;m being authoritarian and mean. I generally just ask her to go brush her teeth once or twice a day, but when I find she has not done so and has not even tried to floss, I get frustrated. I am trying to not let it rise to the level of an argument - but it has on occasion. Telling her that her breath is foul hurts her feelings, but often it is the only way to get her to do a good job of brushing - and I do only tell her that when it is true. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for me? Should I just get over it and let her do what she wants with her own mouth? I just can&#39;t help feeling that she is still just too young to really understand the consequences of having cavities and gingivitus and an unnattractive and uncomfortable overbite. I don&#39;t want her to have to learn that from experience.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58140,"nextTopicId":58146}}
