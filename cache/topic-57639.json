So if the search engine has a whole lot of sites with a<br/>\nsolid keyword density (that is, they talk about unschooling a lot),<br/>\nthen the SERP will be filled with really solid sites. As it is, there<br/>\nare so few sites (compared to a lot of other things, including<br/>\nunschooling detractors) that the SERP is kinda spotty. For instance,<br/>\nthe Wikipedia page on Unschooling comes up before Sandra&#39;s page, but<br/>\nif I was trying to explain unschooling to doubting relatives, I sure<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want them seeing the wikipedia page first, y&#39;know?

And<br/>\nthat is a complete shame, because I think that reading them presents a<br/>\nreally nice balance. The Life Without School collective blog, which is<br/>\nlive but not active, isn&#39;t even on page 3, and it contains the<br/>\nhands-down best essay on why living right now today with your kids is<br/>\nimportant I&#39;ve ever read (Missy&#39;s &quot;Chasing Bananas&quot;, if you want to<br/>\nknow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, the haters and doubters have the upper hand. They&#39;re<br/>\ninterleaved between the good results on the SERP, and that is NOT a<br/>\ngood way to convince search-engine questers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah. If every person who loves and is inspired by unschooling<br/>\nblogged about it, even once a week, and tagged their posts with<br/>\n&quot;unschool, unschooling, homeschooling&quot; we&#39;d have a solid three pages<br/>\nof SERP results before folks got to the bad stuff, and we&#39;d be a<br/>\nsizeable presence on the &quot;homeschooling&quot; searches too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in today&#39;s Google world, a *lot* of folks inform their opinions<br/>\nbased on what they find in the SERP.

My DH was an at-home dad for twelve years with our youngest (and only homeschooled) child. We did some &quot;school at home&quot; stuff, but the majority of Micah&#39;s life has been all about unschooling. Not really radical unschooling until the past three years, but those three years have been amazing. He&#39;s almost 16 now, and I have never seen a teen like him. The only teens in our area are in public school, so that&#39;s a big divider in itself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to answering questions with family, it depended upon who was asking. I, too, had a terrible childhood. It has really dictated how I&#39;ve raised my own kids. My parents didn&#39;t understand the homeschooling part, and definitely wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling at all, so when they ask I usually just pick out a couple of things Micah&#39;s talked about or done recently. I don&#39;t get into philosophical discussions with my parents - we&#39;re too vastly different and I have some serious unresolved &quot;inner child&quot; issues to be able to have any kind of intelligent debate with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy siblings have mixed reactions, and are usually content to tell me how great their kids are doing in school, and asking me what grades Micah&#39;s getting this year. It depends on the context as to how I respond to them. My sister thinks my husband is a total bum for staying home with our kids and &quot;mooching&quot; off me (her words - never mine) for so many years. I don&#39;t even attempt to explain things to her because she&#39;s already made up her mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf family or friends are genuinely interested, I have a discussion with them and show them resources on unschooling and the whole philosophy behind it. I generally try to draw a comparison on how adults learn things (as they need to or want to) and how children learn (by experience, when they need to have a skill, etc). Most of the people whose opinions I care about get this concept. Those who don&#39;t generally back off when they see I&#39;ve gone off on a rant.

I have 3 sisters who don&#39;t.<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten those words leveled at me (ungrateful, willful, bad, screwed<br/>\nup). And to hear my parents, they did it right and I sabotaged it ... by<br/>\ntransferring out of a perfectly good college (I was a nontrad independent<br/>\nolder student whose parent&#39;s permission wasn&#39;t required), and getting out<br/>\nfrom my parents&#39; direct influence for years. Decisions that I think were a<br/>\ngood idea. Then I married and had a baby in my 30s after that. My decision<br/>\nto unschool has been questioned, but not very closely because of all the<br/>\nforegoing history where I did my own thing for so many years without asking<br/>\ntheir opinion or looking for their blessing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everybody has that history with their family. And actually my mother did<br/>\nthe same thing but for longer ... broke with her parent and siblings for 3<br/>\ndecades.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew a handful who did the same thing I did (made their own decisions) but<br/>\nit was different... they did so with their parents glad to see what their<br/>\nkids did, and proud of them. I felt wistful to see it but at the same time<br/>\nencouraged that in some parallel existence or in my imagination my parents<br/>\n*could have* done that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to imagine that they did sometimes, and that makes me feel a lot more<br/>\ncharitable when I go visit. I know logically what their choices are BUT I<br/>\nhave become good at pretending they like me the way I am (they DO like me as<br/>\nwell as their ideal), and just moving through rather than pressing for my<br/>\nparents to like exactly who I am. That partial pretense gives me time to<br/>\nrelax with them and be myself while listening and feeling their wishes for<br/>\nme that I don&#39;t agree with, which I let pass through me. Otherwise I might<br/>\nnot have calmed down and been able to visit at all. I&#39;ve only started<br/>\nspending a little time with them in the last 5 or so years. It is finally ok<br/>\nwith me that we will likely never be close.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part is the emotional reality that children like to move from a<br/>\nsecure connection with their parents into the new world of exploration, and<br/>\nif parents could see how wonderful that is, they might feel confident about<br/>\ntheir grown children making different parenting decisions rather than<br/>\nrejected for the different ways of the generations that come later. In my<br/>\nopinion, unschooling is an excellent way to experience newness on a daily<br/>\nbasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people who haven&#39;t done that most of their lives will find that it&#39;s<br/>\na lot to learn, all of a sudden.

He likes to do<br/>\n&gt; pretty much everything he does.  We had just been talking about how much he<br/>\n&gt; enjoys the piano, how we canned some applesauce from apples we picked, how<br/>\n&gt; he just got a bike with gears and was excited about riding it and using the<br/>\n&gt; gears.  It&#39;s kind of like they are not listening, and that must be confusing<br/>\n&gt; for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may help your son to offer him some things to say in answer to that question. &quot;What do you like to do?&quot; is a kind of standard &quot;conversation starter&quot; that adults use with kids, so set your son up with some &quot;answers&quot; and have some in mind yourself so that if he&#39;s confused you can prompt or answer for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re thinking &quot;homeschool&quot; then piano and applesauce and learning about gears might be sounding &quot;educational&quot; - which means they don&#39;t expect him to like them beyond the way kids like subjects in school. Think of some &quot;fun&quot; things that don&#39;t sound educational for &quot;what do you like&quot; questions and use things like &quot;learning about gears&quot; to answer &quot;what about math/science&quot; questions (or making applesauce or playing piano for that matter!). <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336246301,"authorName":"NCMama","from":"&quot;NCMama&quot; &lt;dharmamama1@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with answering questions from family...","postDate":"1286296817","msgId":57643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk4ZmtkaCs5ZXFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRDMyQkM5RDQzMTdBMC0xQzJDLTE1QUJAd2VibWFpbC1kMDczLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57641,"nextInTopic":57644,"prevInTime":57642,"nextInTime":57644,"topicId":57639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Ask them whether they think that they did a good job raising you.
