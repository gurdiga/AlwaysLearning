We<br/>\ndid not have sex, or even make out (at that time...!), but I felt SO<br/>\nguilty that we did this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had been raised that boys and girls do not sleep in the same place<br/>\nafter a certain, undetermined age, unless they were married. Even my<br/>\nmale cousins&#39; rooms were off-limits when we played at their house, in<br/>\ncase &quot;something&quot; happened...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though the two instances where my boyfriend at the time and I<br/>\nspent the night together (in separate rooms, even) were very<br/>\nlegitimate reasons (he was locked out of his house in the rain past<br/>\nmidnight after I dropped him off the first time, and I had no<br/>\nelectricity in my apartment after a tornado the second time), I still<br/>\nknew that my parents disapproved (don&#39;t know why, but I tell them<br/>\neverything), and I felt that God must disapprove, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I think that God&#39;s smarter than that (my personal view -<br/>\nnot trying to push belief in my faith!) I think had I been given the<br/>\nfreedom to make decisions on my own, with the knowledge that I was<br/>\nTRUSTED enough to make WISE decisions, and the knowledge that any<br/>\nUNWISE decisions I would own up to, then I would have made those same<br/>\ndecisions but probably would not have felt any guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, what I did was not wrong, even according to the &quot;no sex<br/>\nbefore marriage&quot; idea. I helped out a friend, who happened to be male,<br/>\nwho happened to REALLY like me :) I made a good choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd though I hope my children understand that sex is a very special<br/>\nact to be shared only when they are certain they are ready, I also<br/>\nwant them to be free to make choices every day that are based not on<br/>\nfear of guilt but rather on the principal of love (the kind of love<br/>\nthat is implied by &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39265,"nextTopicId":39300}}
