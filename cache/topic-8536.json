The thing is..she only had me, no other children and she still didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the time. Her important things were having the perfect  brand new house <br/>\n( often trading up for a bigger & better one), the nic naks, the 3 cars, and <br/>\nbragging rights.....<br/>\nWell, she admits that now......only because she no longer have those <br/>\nluxuries.......<br/>\n<br/>\n Back then, she did understand why I was so distant as a teenager and didn&#39;t <br/>\ncome to her and talk with her about things ,was a loner and kept myself busy <br/>\nwith so many activities at school. I honestly didn&#39;t find the need to be <br/>\nhome......<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8533,"nextTopicId":8539}}
