They&#39;re crying because a<br/>\nmature market animal is valuable, and those calves won&#39;t reach maturity. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen calves killed by wolves.  The rancher here who lost calves is<br/>\na friend of my husbands, and I was at the vets by accident when he was<br/>\ncalled out to confirm it was wolves, so I got to go. One wasn&#39;t dead yet<br/>\nand was shot and killed by the rancher after we arrived.  It happened in<br/>\nthe forest on public land.  Wolves didn&#39;t come sneaking in to his<br/>\npicturesque barn like marauders in the night.

I lived there during the very controversial air hunt and shoot<br/>\ndays when wolves and packs were chased and nearly run to death and then<br/>\nshot from the air when they couldn&#39;t run any more.  <br/>\nAlaska has had and maintains a stable wolf population because the wolf<br/>\nprey population is healthy.   It&#39;s healthy because of wolves, not in<br/>\nspite of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly the controversial air hunts have ended but the state Game Board<br/>\nallowed hunting wolves from snow machines two years ago and there was<br/>\nrecently new legislation proposed that would expand the area currently<br/>\nopen to moving snow machine hunts.  The current area is 27,500 square<br/>\nmiles and the limit of wolf kills is 10 per day per licensed hunter.   I<br/>\nbelieve the proposal to expand the area has failed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe worries about declining wolf prey populations by some accounts are<br/>\nwithout merit.   Although the Delta caribou populations have decreased<br/>\nsteadily since about 1989, some estimate the decline between 1,000 and<br/>\n4,000 animals, which is significant,  biologist report naturally<br/>\ndeclining wolf numbers in the area already.   Wolves respond to declining<br/>\nprey populations by slowing their reproductive rate. And the overall<br/>\ncaribou and moose populations throughout the state are stable and even<br/>\nincreasing, despite the Delta herd decline.   There are several biologist<br/>\nexpressing their opinion that the caribou decline at Delta is due to<br/>\nchanging weather patterns and decreasing food supply as much as<br/>\npredation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a recent proposal to kill wolves in a game management area near<br/>\nAnchorage.   There is an estimated 120 wolves in the area in 13 packs.  <br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard yet about the plan or the numbers.   They will of course<br/>\nhave to kill bears too, because decreased wolf population could directly<br/>\nresult in increased bear encounters as bears will take up the slack in<br/>\nthe predation of local moose.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe very, very bottom line is Alaska can and does make huge amounts of<br/>\nmoney in these areas, Delta game management area south of Fairbanks and<br/>\nGame management area 16B near Anchorage,(across Cook Inlet, north and<br/>\nwest of Anchorage)  from local and out of state big game hunters.  <br/>\nDeclining moose and caribou numbers means declining revenue to the State<br/>\nand to local outfitters.   Alaska estimates 15% of it&#39;s population are<br/>\nhunters, that&#39;s enormously more than any other state.   Politically,<br/>\nhunters in Alaska have a lot of clout, like ranchers in Montana. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is very little evidence to suggest wolves would starve themselves<br/>\nby killing too many prey animals.   They have a very well defined social<br/>\nstructure and manage their own numbers reproductively.   No one on the<br/>\nState Game board, primarily hunters and trappers, is concerned with wolf<br/>\nwelfare.  They are not worried about wolves starving to death.   They are<br/>\nworried about the revenue of big game hunting and wolves are in direct<br/>\ncompetition with humans in that area.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading a book my brother has called Game Management in Montana. <br/>\nIt&#39;s from 1971 and it says, &quot;Records from 1875 to 1877 show about 30,000<br/>\nwolf skins were shipped out of Fort Benton annually.&quot;  Four pages later<br/>\nit says, &quot;The disappearance of the wolf from the State was due to the<br/>\nwolf&#39;s inability to adjust to civilization and not necessarily to control<br/>\nefforts.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"wolf essay","postDate":"1039098591","msgId":11133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwLjI5ZjhiNTIzLjJiMjBiY2RmQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11135,"prevInTime":11132,"nextInTime":11134,"topicId":11133,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is one state in which the grey wolf population has stayed very healthy, that is Alaska.
