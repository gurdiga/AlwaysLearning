If something doesn&#39;t matter to us, if it has no <br/>\nrelevance to anything in our lives, then there is no reason for us to <br/>\nremember it, and we usually don&#39;t. But when we choose to study <br/>\nsomething that is important to us, when we have that desire, then what <br/>\nwe learn becomes a part of who we are. We make room for the memory in <br/>\nour mind, and we use the information in context with what we already <br/>\nknow. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Lissa Coffey<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nAnna<br/>\nMiami,Florida</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39653,"nextTopicId":39742}}
