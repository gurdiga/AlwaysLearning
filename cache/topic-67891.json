Scissors and cut circles of paper to make snowflakes (could be too messy for some places). A few oddments of yarn, large-eyed needle and a plastic canvas shape (for little ones just tie the yarn onto the needle so it doesn&#39;t get annoying by keep coming off - the holes in the canvas are large enough for the knot to pass through).<br/>\n<br/>\nPipe cleaners are my personal all-time favourite though - because they can become pretty much anything my son might want, within reason ;-) I made a T-Rex tonight, among other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sylvia Woodman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sylvia057@...\">sylvia057@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, 23 June 2012, 22:26<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Secret stash<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286002181,"authorName":"sunny1of1","from":"&quot;sunny1of1&quot; &lt;Sunnyoneof1@...&gt;","profile":"sunny1of1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Secret stash","postDate":"1340494822","msgId":67895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzNWs1Nis2MHF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0xfT2ZLLW9SZ0xXb3FjMldWemoyNlBZaWpKVFNQdzdFMUJzX2ZWTVUzMT0yUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67893,"nextInTopic":67896,"prevInTime":67894,"nextInTime":67896,"topicId":67891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love poetry strips keeping a stash of strips of words that you can line up to make sayings, poetry, etc. I keep Sharpie fine liners for Zentangles too.
