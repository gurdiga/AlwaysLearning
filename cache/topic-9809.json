We live in the city -- and sometimes I get a little weirded out about certain puddles (such as the ones with car fluids floating on top)....but mostly I let dd jump away! About a week ago, I drained all the water from her swimming pool. Dd proceeded to get her water boots on and splashed around wildly in the street as the water flowed down to the storm drain. My neighbor came out, made a face, and stated (angrily) &quot;Ach! That water is dirty! Why are you letting her jump in dirty water?&quot; I informed her that my daughter was having fun and does take baths.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a small town with a big back yard. My fondest memory of being a little kid is playing in the dirt, stomping in streams, puddle jumping....basically we loved anything that involved getting totally filthy. I will never deny my daughter similar opportunities!<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Our Rainy Day/nasty neighbors","postDate":"1034279440","msgId":9809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjLjEzNDY2NWQxLjJhZDczNDEwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9810,"prevInTime":9808,"nextInTime":9810,"topicId":9809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/10/02 10:37:05 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

(the kids and I are spending the day reorganizing <br/>\nbook shelves :o( boring!) <br/>\n<br/>\nOur neighbor once had the nerve to come over and tell me that it wasn&#39;t fair <br/>\nthat my kids got to play outside during the day. I asked why it mattered to <br/>\nher, her kids are in school all day. She told me that every time they are at <br/>\nhome on a parent teacher conference day or other holiday from school, they <br/>\nsee my kids running around playing. Since she was at work, her kids had to <br/>\nstay inside until she got home at 5, and they spent the day calling her at <br/>\nwork asking to play outside. This of course is very disruptive to her work <br/>\nday and she doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with it. I had suggested that she <br/>\nlet the kids come out to play, I was out with the kids, they would have fun. <br/>\nShe, very meanly, told me, she didn&#39;t want her children getting the idea that <br/>\nhsing is fun. :o( She then told me she had gone to great lengths to tell her <br/>\nkids that Moly and Jack had to do all the same things they did at school, all <br/>\nthe bookwork and tests and that them seeing ours out disputed that idea in <br/>\nher kids heads. So I told her hsing didn&#39;t have to be that way, my kids don&#39;t <br/>\nhave bookwork or tests, my kids are free to play and be kids. She sent her <br/>\nkids home too, after hearing me say that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, her children have come over often, asking questions about hsing. <br/>\nThey are very curious about our lives, and how Moly and Jack learn to read <br/>\nand do things like math and science. (Moly said she wished they would get the <br/>\nidea and just play, since she isn&#39;t too fond of feeling like a monkey in the <br/>\nzoo.) It is a constant source of wonder when I explain that we don&#39;t divide <br/>\nour learning into groups like math, reading, and science. When they see Moly <br/>\nreading about the human body and playing with her models, I hear things like <br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t get to learn about that until high school.&quot; When they see Jack <br/>\nreading a book with chapters, the youngest Jack&#39;s age, made a comment that <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; to read *chapter books* until next year. (Jack wanted to <br/>\nknow what a chapter book was.) Many times I have had to sit and explain that <br/>\nI have never grouped books into categories like chapter books. They are <br/>\namazed that my kids can read and write. By the things they say, I am sure <br/>\ntheir mother has gone to great lengths to get them to believe they would <br/>\nnever learn by just being kids. :o(<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy Who would rather hear all about everyone&#39;s great and not-so-great <br/>\nunschooling days than any &#39;ole neighbor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9793,"nextTopicId":9815}}
