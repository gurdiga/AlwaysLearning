She does not look at porn.<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone says they will let their child eat all the candy he wants, I <br/>\nthink some people picture a kid in cartoon mode, surrounded by empty candy <br/>\nwrappers, all bloated after a four hour binge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that when someone says &quot;my kids don&#39;t have a bedtime&quot; some <br/>\nmight think kids just stay up for days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things don&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just asked Holly, who&#39;s watching the Simpsons next to me, whether she&#39;s <br/>\never seen any porn.  I read her the rest of this post.  She said she never has.  <br/>\nI asked if she&#39;s ever even walked in and seen something on the computer that <br/>\nthe boys were looking at.  No.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her if she&#39;d ever seen a Playboy or anything like that.  No.<br/>\nAt somone else&#39;s house, maybe?  No.<br/>\nWould you like to?  She kinda laughed, and said no.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Keith has a small stack of stuff from the 70&#39;s up in a box in his closet.  A <br/>\nformer roommate moved out and left them, and they&#39;ve been in that box for <br/>\nyears.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Marty and Kirby have seen some, but they seem pretty open and calm and <br/>\nKirby&#39;s room is very rarely locked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSaying it would be okay with a parent if a child wanted to watch something is <br/>\nnot even remotely the same as the parent providing a child with something the <br/>\nchild had shown no interest in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly knows she wouldn&#39;t be in trouble if she had seen porn.  She has no <br/>\nreason to lie, and no reason to seek it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question we get sometimes is whether people let their young children <br/>\nsee R movies with sex scenes.   Few young kids will even look at romance <br/>\nscenes, and if kissing starts they&#39;ll say EEYEW!   Why would those kids want to see <br/>\nsex?  They don&#39;t even want to see candlelit dinners with hand holding.  They <br/>\nwant to see dogs, and singing pickpockets and flying cars.  But if the parents <br/>\nwere willing, the children made a choice, and they chose not to.   If a child <br/>\nHAD no choice, he might wonder or wish or want or feel deprived.  And worse, <br/>\nhe might wait for that promised day when he can do the forbidden thing.  And <br/>\nafter waiting five or ten years, y&#39;think he&#39;ll just forego his glorified reward?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110659280,"authorName":"Jennifer and Scott Lynch","from":"Jennifer and Scott Lynch &lt;j.slynch@...&gt;","profile":"eviemom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: sex, alcohol, guns and swords (a little\tlong)","postDate":"1082775024","msgId":19423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDQUY0MDIwLjkzMDglai5zbHluY2hAY2hhcnRlci5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2Y2U5citqZ21qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19417,"nextInTopic":19427,"prevInTime":19422,"nextInTime":19424,"topicId":19405,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"what ages are your children?  is this really the way it is at your house?  looking at porn is no different than looking at seahorses? really?  at what age did","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-350773617\">what ages are your children?  is this really the way it is at your<br/>\nhouse?  looking at porn is no different than looking at seahorses?<br/>\nreally?  at what age did your children begin looking at porn?<br/>\ni know i was sheltered during my upbringing but my goodness.<br/>\nthanks, leslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 4.  She does not look at porn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew something in that post would end up as a &quot;hot potato&quot; and it looks<br/>\nlike that is the one.  I think Sandra and Dana&#39;s follow-up posts are helpful<br/>\nin clarifying my point.  Why is porn any &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than anything<br/>\nelse?  What will happen if my child sees porn?  What will happen if I forbid<br/>\nporn? What is the overall principle I am trying to live by with regards to<br/>\naccess to information? What happens at the magical age of 18 that makes<br/>\nseeing porn okay? Why is sexual activity, in all its myriad forms, so taboo?<br/>\n<br/>\nSex and the sexuality of children is a really tough issue for a lot of<br/>\npeople.  There is a book called &quot;My Mommy Laid an Egg&quot; by Babette Cole.  It<br/>\nis a hilariously illustrated account of two parents who are trying to tell<br/>\ntheir children how babies are made and are giving them all sorts of<br/>\nridiculous explanations (they&#39;re found under rocks, squeezed out of tubes<br/>\netc.) The children roll their eyes and proceed to draw in vivid detail the<br/>\nreal story of sexual intercourse and fertilization for their obviously<br/>\nmisinformed parents.  There is a particularly hilarious page where the words<br/>\nsay &quot;These are some ways Mommies and Daddies fit together.&quot;  The<br/>\nillustrations are of Mommies and Daddies engaged in intercourse hanging from<br/>\nballoons, on a roller coaster etc.  I took it to my daughter&#39;s gymnastics<br/>\nclass to share with two of the mothers who asked for suggestions of<br/>\nchildren&#39;s books about &quot;where babies come from&quot; for their children who were<br/>\nasking.  All the moms laughed at the book and said it was great and all of<br/>\nthem said they wouldn&#39;t be able to read it to their kids, it would be too<br/>\nembarrassing and it was too much information.  I was stunned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your reactions and questions Leslie.  To be honest this is all<br/>\ntheoretical at this time.  If this list still exists years from now and if<br/>\nmy daughter ever starts looking at porn I will have to get back to you with<br/>\nmy reactions of the moment.  All our societal taboos around sex and pleasure<br/>\n(whether from sex or food or whatever) are really puzzling and infuriating<br/>\nto me.  That is a discussion for another place, I am happy to talk about it<br/>\noff-list if you are really interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these are just my opinions.  I like being able to express them!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Leslie, and Sandra and Dana!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: sex, alcohol, guns and swords (a little long)","postDate":"1082774892","msgId":19417,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYuMjc5ZTgzZDEuMmRiYjJmNmNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19414,"nextInTopic":19423,"prevInTime":19416,"nextInTime":19418,"topicId":19405,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/23/2004 8:30:02 PM Mountain Daylight Time, hoffmanwilson@yahoo.com writes: ((I agree with everything you said, Sandra....So please don t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1593794617\">In a message dated 4/23/2004 8:30:02 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoffmanwilson@...\">hoffmanwilson@...</a> writes:<br/>\n((I agree with everything you said, Sandra....So<br/>\nplease don&#39;t quote me (hoffmanwilson) as the one<br/>\nasking the question ;)  I believe Leslie (?) asked the<br/>\nquestion, and I just answered)<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I cut and paste the e-mail just plugs in the info from the post it came <br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I notice it and delete that line, and sometimes I don&#39;t even think <br/>\nabout it.

I have read with great interest the<br/>\nemails regarding porn, alcohol and (in the slightly distant past) guns and<br/>\nswords.  I believe that those of us who choose to unschool do so because the<br/>\ngoals, priorities and methods of the Institution of School (capitalization<br/>\non purpose) do not match the goals, priorities and methods we wish for our<br/>\nfamilies.  Every person is unique and every family is unique.  School does<br/>\nnot recognize that.  School works to erase that.  No one has a definitive<br/>\nanswer that will work for all people in all situations. (I love when Sandra<br/>\nasks for more info before giving advice!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s family has a biological legacy of the disease of alcohol.  Her<br/>\nattitudes, concerns and advice about it will be colored through her life.<br/>\nPeople should read what she has to say and rejoice that they have heard<br/>\nanother perspective, check if it works in their life, if it does, HURRAH!<br/>\nApply it to your question or problem.  If it doesn&#39;t listen to someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame for porn/sex/computer wackiness. I think most of us would agree that<br/>\npart of living an unschooling life is that freedom to choose is very<br/>\nimportant.  I would be shocked if I found out that, for the people on this<br/>\nlist, the only acceptable images of sex would be procreative sex between a<br/>\nman and a woman.  Come on!  I don&#39;t want to start a debate about porn.  I am<br/>\nagainst the exploitation of anything against its will.  But I am 100% for<br/>\ncreative, interesting, unique and arousing ideas about sex.  For my family,<br/>\nwe have a healthy, stable, safe house and set of overall relationships.  Why<br/>\nwould/should looking at porn be any different than looking at seahorses,<br/>\ngaming tricks or electrical circuit instructions?  Do it privately, ask<br/>\nquestions if you want, enjoy it if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for guns and swords. . . I was fascinated by the discussion a few months<br/>\nago regarding the purchase of guns and swords for children who requested<br/>\nthem.  Until reading those posts I was very against the idea of even having<br/>\ntoy guns in the house.  The posts from people who bought their kids guns and<br/>\nknives and swords and taught them to use them really brought completely into<br/>\nthe ethos of unschooling.  &quot;Damn!&quot; I said to myself &quot;What is my problem?&quot;<br/>\nSomehow I had picked up the general idea that &quot;guns are bad,&quot; &quot;Having guns<br/>\nwill make a bad person.&quot;  My daughter has no interest in guns or swords at<br/>\nthis point in  her life.  I am thrilled that my eyes were opened to a<br/>\ndifferent way of thinking about it all because if she ever wants to take up<br/>\narchery or target shooting or sword fighting I will be ale to say, with a<br/>\ntruly open heart, &quot;alright honey, let&#39;s get you what you need.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery interaction (whether in person or online) is a chance to gather more<br/>\n&quot;data&quot; for one&#39;s life.  File the stuff that makes you uncomfortable for<br/>\nlater (you never know when you&#39;ll use it) and embrace the stuff that feels<br/>\nright that you had never thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this list totally rocks, I am so excited to read everything<br/>\neveryday.  I love the &quot;day in the life&quot; posts most of all because it makes<br/>\nme so happy to know that we are not the only family out there enjoying our<br/>\nlife so very much.  Keep all the great stuff coming everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19291,"nextTopicId":19435}}
