We went to the <br/>\nlibrary and read a few books.  Then he picked out two Little Bear books to take <br/>\nhome.  He wanted to know why we borrow books (I guess instead of buying them).  I <br/>\ntold him we couldn&#39;t afford that many books.  Then we parked the van down the <br/>\nstreet and walked back to the farmer&#39;s market.  [The library will tow your <br/>\ncar if you leave it in their lot and go to the farmer&#39;s market, and they watch <br/>\nfor it, too.]  <br/>\nHe picked up a pink tomato and asked what it was.  He saw blackberries and <br/>\nblueberries and talked me into buying some.  He saw some kohlrabi and pointed <br/>\nthem out to me.  The vendor offered me a taste.  It was good.  Will didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto try it.  He tried a blackberry and didn&#39;t really like it.  He ate the whole <br/>\nthing, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe browsed some more at the market, he fondling a different tomato at each <br/>\nstand and pointing out squash to me.  He saw watermelons and we agreed we <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t buy a big one for just the 2 of us.<br/>\nAt the last stand he picked out 2 peaches and I picked out some butter baker <br/>\npotatoes.  I promised him we would make a blueberry cobbler with lots of <br/>\nsugar.<br/>\nWe took our treasures and walked back toward the van.  We saw a trolley and <br/>\ndecided to take a ride.  We rode the whole circuit for 25 cents, Will making <br/>\neyes with a group of old ladies that got on midway through.<br/>\nOn the way home, he played with the calculator in the van.  He punched in 22 <br/>\nand said, &quot;Look mom!  Too-ty-two!&quot;  I figure when he can read &quot;twenty&quot;, he&#39;ll <br/>\nfigure it out.  <br/>\nWe went home and read the Little Bear books.  I made the cobbler with too <br/>\nmuch dough and it spilled over onto the oven floor, but it was delicious just the <br/>\nsame.  Will particularly like the almost-burnt crust (that he called &quot;crush&quot;) <br/>\non the outside of the pan.<br/>\nHe begged me to take him to the &quot;two parks&quot; and we finally did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAddenda, 9/22/03<br/>\nI read this to Will.  He smiled and laughed.  He said &quot;I remember skipping <br/>\n12.&quot;  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I said.  And he said, &quot;I&#39;d go, &#39;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <br/>\n11, 13&#39; and you&#39;d say, &#39;POOR 12!&#39;&quot;<br/>\nThen he got up and walked back to the living room.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16378,"nextTopicId":16425}}
