So if the more prominent<br/>\nunschooling families (the ones who are active on blogs, Facebook, yahoo<br/>\ngroups) won&#39;t go on TV, who will they end up with?! Some newer to<br/>\nunschooling family who may see the money and perhaps fame as a draw? They<br/>\nmay not be the best representation of unschooling, if there is a GOOD way to<br/>\nshow unschooling on TV (debatable).
