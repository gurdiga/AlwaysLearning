I believe (please confirm or clarify if I&#39;m wrong) that each new member receives an e-mail introduction asking them to read the main page.  One thing that page has said for a long time is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are moderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping in.)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo members have been let out the hole for rude letters to the list and/or to moderators.  It&#39;s work to manage a discussion like this, and those who come with the purpose of insult and disruption aren&#39;t welcome.
