When<br/>\na child is a toddler that child may not want a lot other than mom,<br/>\nincluding dad. As they get older they probably continue having social<br/>\npreferences. The desire for friends just wants the lucky off chance of<br/>\nmeeting people one likes. Not everybody likes the same kinds of people<br/>\nand some people just don&#39;t have much in common. There&#39;s no flaw there.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t used to know that about people and social things. Seems<br/>\nobvious to me now but as a teen I just thought I was an odd duck. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may not have a thing to do with awkwardness. Or anxiety. And if it<br/>\ndoes, that&#39;s still not about being flawed. Anxiety is emotion. It&#39;s<br/>\nawful when emotion is discussed as though it were a disorder.

He gravitates to<br/>\nlots of verbal stuff, different lingo (last couple of days it&#39;s been<br/>\nJesus Christ in Spanish = Jesus Cristo), and new stories are the bomb.<br/>\nLast night, I told him what I could remember of The Little Prince and<br/>\nmade up the rest, with the thought to get that book to read soon as<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost my copy somewhere. He asked me about Loch Lomon&#39; and I<br/>\nlooked up the lyrics and sang the song to him. There was a back story<br/>\nto that which was sad about Scottish history.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther kids who aren&#39;t into that sort of thing are ok to play with but<br/>\nmaybe not as fun.

I have horrible social anxiety, too. So, when we have one of these moments, I tell my son about my own feelings and how I have overcome them at times. Of course, I am honest and let him know that sometimes I don&#39;t overcome my anxiety. He makes his decision and I support it. There are plenty of opportunities so if he misses one party, he isn&#39;t bothered too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot knowing people at a party can be terrifying. We now don&#39;t attend large gatherings where there are more people my son doesn&#39;t know than does know. He seems content with this. It seems that your son does know most of the kids at the party, though. In a similar situation, I would re-stress this to my son. I would also focus on all of the positive, fun things happening at the party. Also, I give my son an &quot;out&quot; clause. If at any time when we are at a public function he feels very uncomfortable and wants to leave, we leave immediately. This does help my son a great deal, knowing that it&#39;s ok to leave at any moment. I also mention that no one will mind and it&#39;s perfectly ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that your son has decided to stay home and is feeling bad, I would just support him and tell him there are many other opportunities. My son has also done this and I hate to see him sad. I also offer to do something with him that&#39;s fun like building Legos or watching a DVD together.
