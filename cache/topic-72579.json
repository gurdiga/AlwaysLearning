Unschooling philosophy has helped me to let go of A LOT of my  fears about life in general but the one fear that I can&#39;t seem to free my mind of is trying to prevent my children from cancer (maybe an irrational thought).As any other parent, we all want our children to be happy AND healthy mentally and physically. I am trying more and more to be &quot;safe without being irrational&quot; but then- what is   &#39;safety&#39; in regards to gaming ? I am aware of safety -with  protection  -in other aspects of our lives (i.e. strapping my small children into a car seat and the rest of Us strapping in ourselves knowing that it will protect us in an accident compared to not wearing one) but what is &#39;safe&#39; with protection in  regards to wifi and technology&#39;s radiation emissions??.I&#39;ve actually read about radiation shields to put on cell phones , supposedly proven to lower radiation levels via a radiation meter but it could very well be a scam!  Playing world of tanks game for two or three hours makes my son beaming with happiness and I Will not restrict his time because of the smile on his face when he talks about the game. And he does live happily away from the computer as well. What remains in the back if my mind is what if damage is being done by radiation to his body that I could be protecting him from? But then again I Don&#39;t know the radiation levels from our cordless house phone or t.v. or microwave oven, etc.  that we&#39;ve had since before our children were born and yet I&#39;ve never thought to worry about those and our children were born as healthy babies and are still healthy. Did I just prove my own self crazy??? If I were really crazy I guess I would say that the emf might be greater from wifi and I should be protecting my family more and  that &#39;s why I should worry more. But that is just too exhausting and takes time away from my beautiful family that I Am thoroughly enjoying through unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72583,"nextTopicId":72551}}
