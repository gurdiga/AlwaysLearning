I&#39;ve always been curious what my ferrets would do if allowed<br/>\nloose with a gerbil or rat, but since I&#39;m afraid that they really would<br/>\nkill the rodents, I haven&#39;t tried it.  I have a rescue ferret that<br/>\nturned out to be deaf after I&#39;d already adopted him, and he was so<br/>\nbrutally aggressive - leaping on my pants leg, climbing up and biting me<br/>\nin the stomach (I swear I&#39;m not making this up!), that I took him to the<br/>\nlocal ferret expert to see if he was too crazy to keep.  She figured out<br/>\nthat he was deaf, and helped me deal with his behavioral problems.  I<br/>\nstill don&#39;t allow strangers to touch him or get my mouth too close to<br/>\nhis mouth (he still likes to latch onto lips), and my husband and oldest<br/>\nson still don&#39;t care to handle him much, but overall he&#39;s become a very<br/>\ndecent pet now.  My funniest ferret story ever was a couple of years ago<br/>\nwhen I still owned my Border Terrier, who came from a line of dogs bred<br/>\nto go to ground - a dog sport where they work through a tunnel to find a<br/>\nferret or rat in a cage and then bark maniacally.  He was never the<br/>\nboldest of Border Terriers, but he loved to stalk the ferrets.  One day<br/>\nthe above-mentioned aggressive ferret got loose.  I didn&#39;t realize this<br/>\nuntil I walked through my family room, only to see my terrier slumping<br/>\nthrough the room like Eeyore (sp?), with the ferret merrily bouncing<br/>\nalong behind him, grabbing at his hindquarters!  It was the saddest,<br/>\nfunniest thing you&#39;ve ever seen!  I told the Border Terrier&#39;s breeder<br/>\nabout it and she made me promise never to tell the rest of the Border<br/>\nTerrier club, for fear of utter humiliation.<br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Pam Hartley [mailto:pamhartley@...] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 09, 2002 1:09 AM<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 304: pets...mice, rats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 304: pets...mice, rats<br/>\nDate: Mon, Apr 8, 2002, 8:15 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Never mind<br/>\n&gt; that the ferrets kept as pets have been domesticated for hundreds of<br/>\n&gt; years and thousands of generations and most likely couldn&#39;t even<br/>\n </span></blockquote>survive<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the wild.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cats have been domesticated even longer, but there&#39;s plenty of feral<br/>\ncats<br/>\nthat can thrive at quite the expense to the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nFerrets can&#39;t.

I<br/>\nthink there are two issues to consider: which are easiest to care for,<br/>\nand which make the best pets.  My experience has been that rats are the<br/>\nbest pets by a huge margin (though if you were including ferrets in this<br/>\ndiscussion, they would be equal to rats, but in a very different way),<br/>\nbut gerbils are by far the easiest to care for.  Since gerbils are<br/>\ndesert animals, they don&#39;t go through a lot of water.  They eat a lot<br/>\nless that rats or ferrets also, and since they are not carnivores like<br/>\nrats and ferrets, they&#39;re poop doesn&#39;t smell as much.  A friend of ours<br/>\nwho is very gerbil experienced gave us a great tip  - put lots of drier<br/>\nlint in the tank and let them tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.  It makes them<br/>\nmuch happier and much more fun to watch.  With that said, I will never<br/>\nown gerbils again.  I personally think they were put on the planet to<br/>\nbite people&#39;s children.  Since rats eat meat-based foods, they&#39;re poop<br/>\nis wetter and smellier, and they eat and drink a lot more than gerbils,<br/>\nbut they are SO, SO much fun to own.  They come to you rather than<br/>\nrunning from you, they love to snuggle in your hair, they come when<br/>\ncalled much of the time, they kiss (I hear some of you saying ewwww!)<br/>\n:), and you can train them.  It&#39;s like having a tiny dog in a cage!!  I<br/>\nfound guinea pigs to be more trouble than gerbils and not near as<br/>\nrewarding as rats.  Ferrets are awesome, but lots of work and<br/>\nlong-lived.
