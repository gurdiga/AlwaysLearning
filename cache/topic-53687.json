And we  <br/>\nburn used paper plates and cups to start the hot tub anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know how to wash dishes by hand, it&#39;s that one  <br/>\none side of the sink is the microwave and on the other is a breadmaker  <br/>\nand toaster.

I never even had a dishwasher in my life until  <br/>\nafter Marty was born.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve washed dishes twice since it broke last week, and both times I  <br/>\npsyched myself up for it and was grateful for the small amount of  <br/>\ndirty dishes, because Keith and Marty and Ashlee his girlfriend were  <br/>\nactually using paper, and eating things that didn&#39;t need dishes.

I&#39;m not really sure how to handle them. Should I ask the girls to come get their clothes once I&#39;ve folded/hung them or should I put their clothes away? Should I clean their rooms? Should I clean the bathroom and computer room that only they use? Or should I stay out of those spaces that are theirs and let them deal with them?==<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no harm in asking for help as long as you are willing to accept, &quot;No,&quot; for an answer. My 2 younger children are almost 3 and 6.5 years old so I wash, fold and put their clothes away for them most of the time. There are times when they join me and help or my 6 year old will do some on his own. I clean their room most of the time. Sometimes I ask for help. Sometimes they will help. Sometimes not. Sometimes they see me cleaning and decide to help without being asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my oldest son, who is 19 now, I pretty much leave his room to him. If I notice we are running low on glasses, I&#39;ll ask him if he&#39;ll bring the dirty dishes from his room to the kitchen. If I see dishes in his room, I&#39;ll grab them if I can. When doing laundry I&#39;ll tell him so he can throw stuff in if he wants. I usually can&#39;t get his dirty clothes out of his room because most of the time they are mixed up with the clean ones and I can&#39;t tell which is which. If he has dirty clothes in his basket, I&#39;ll grab those. If I wash them I also fold them and put them away. Sometimes I&#39;ve just left his clothes on his bed. I&#39;ve had people ask me why I do his laundry since he&#39;s capable of doing it himself. I respond that I do my husband&#39;s laundry (most of the time) as part of doing the family laundry so why wouldn&#39;t I do my child&#39;s? He can and does do his own laundry, too, when he feels the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I begin to feel the need to clean his room, I&#39;ll tell him. &quot;Hey. If I can get to it, I&#39;d like to clean your room sometime soon.&quot; If he really doesn&#39;t want me to, he&#39;ll say so. Most of the time, though, he doesn&#39;t mind. Although, he does say he doesn&#39;t like it that he can&#39;t find things after I&#39;ve cleaned in there. I don&#39;t take things or rearrange things. Mostly, it&#39;s just cleaning up trash, dirty dishes and getting clothes off the floor so I can vacuum. The other night I was lying in bed and I saw his bedroom door open and a small bag of trash being tossed out. He was cleaning his room for his own reasons and to his own satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 19 year old also has a bathroom that is pretty much exclusively his. I approach that the same way as the other stuff. Sometimes I clean it. Sometimes I ask him to clean it but I don&#39;t get angry or upset if he says, &quot;Not now.&quot; A lot of times I can&#39;t get to his bathroom because I am more focused on keeping the common areas of the house clean. Yesterday I noticed that his bathroom was particularly dirty. He was heading out the door so I knew he didn&#39;t have time to really clean it. I asked if he&#39;d just throw away the trash that was in there. He said, &quot;Before I leave?&quot; I said that would be appreciated. He did it, quick and easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this has been mentioned on this list before (sometimes I get the places where I read things mixed up) but I&#39;ll say it again. Just a couple of years ago I had an epiphany from something I read on one of these unschooling discussion groups or an offshoot of one of them. I think it was the Peaceful Partners (or is it Partnership?) yahoo group but I can&#39;t remember for sure now. Anyway, it was the realization that if something bothered me, it was my issue, my problem. Since it was mine and I could be responsible for it, I could enjoy dealing with it however I chose. All of a sudden I looked at the messy bathroom and thought, &quot;I want to clean it,&quot; rather than, &quot;Ugh. Why do I have to clean this filthy room?&quot; Cleaning the bathroom became enjoyable. <br/>\n<br/>\nI choose home much or how little effort to put into anything. I don&#39;t have to fold the laundry and/or put it away. I could leave it in the dryer. I could leave it in the basket. I could toss into drawers without folding it. I don&#39;t have to do it according to anyone else&#39;s schedule or standards and neither should my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Laundry and Cleaning Rooms","postDate":"1272801226","msgId":53700,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2ODcxODc3LTU2QTMtNDc3OS04N0NDLUQxREVENzM4RDdGN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhyaG9kcys1Yjk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhyaG9kcys1Yjk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53690,"nextInTopic":53707,"prevInTime":53699,"nextInTime":53701,"topicId":53687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It depends on your expectations. If you expect them to  <br/>\nactually put the clothes away it will build resentment in you when  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t. If you are fine with whatever system works for them then  <br/>\nwhy not. As Pam has said, don&#39;t set your kids up to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re asking because you&#39;ve done all the folding and in the back  <br/>\nof your mind you think they should do part of the job, then I&#39;d work  <br/>\non getting past that.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvite one or more along to help fold. Tell stories, talk about stuff.  <br/>\nOr do it while you watch TV and ask if someone would like to do  <br/>\nsomething easy like matching socks. (Though tasks I thought were easy  <br/>\nweren&#39;t so easy before my daughter reached puberty.

Let it be their space but do them the  <br/>\nfavor of giving them order occasionally. They&#39;ll see your techniques  <br/>\nfor tackling a big problem. They may not right now appreciate it as  <br/>\nmuch as the effort it takes, but that&#39;s because<br/>\n<br/>\n1) it&#39;s not near the top of their priority list so while they will  <br/>\nprobably appreciate the end result, the amount of work needed to get  <br/>\nit there is more than it&#39;s worth to them right now and<br/>\n<br/>\n2) kids assume that adults never do anything they don&#39;t want to do so  <br/>\nclearning will seem like the way you want to spend your time.

They might like you to clean their rooms; they might prefer their privacy be respected even if it means their rooms get messy. They might like to take care of things themselves with the understanding that they can ask you for help if they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often ask the kids if they would like to do something. I don&#39;t say, for instance, &quot;Eric, put your clothes away,&quot; but I often say, &quot;I folded the clean laundry, it&#39;s on my bed, do you think you&#39;ll have a minute to put your stuff away?&quot; or &quot;It would be a big help if you&#39;d take your dirty plate to the kitchen,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to do laundry, would you like to take a minute and check your room for dirty clothes? You can just toss them in my hamper or put them in the hall outside your door.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl finds it easier to help than Eric does. On the other hand, as he approaches his ninth birthday Eric seems to be getting really interested in helping and in being independent (just now, when I complained that it was hard for me to watch our two-year-old and cook dinner at the same time, he offered to walk her to the park and push her on the swings. And now they&#39;ve been gone long enough I finished getting my stew simmering and had time to check e-mail!). What I try to do is give them _opportunities_ to help, which they sometimes take and sometimes don&#39;t. At the same time, I offer my help. When there&#39;s something that needs to be done, we usually present a &quot;helped by parent&quot; version and a &quot;do it self&quot; version.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it doesn&#39;t have to be, &quot;This is always my job, and that is always your job.&quot; It&#39;s more fluid than that at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160276266,"authorName":"Amanda&#39;s Shoebox","from":"&quot;Amanda&#39;s Shoebox&quot; &lt;amandasshoebox@...&gt;","profile":"amandasshoebox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Laundry and Cleaning Rooms","postDate":"1272734972","msgId":53687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyaG9kcys1Yjk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":53689,"prevInTime":53686,"nextInTime":53688,"topicId":53687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been unschooling for a few months now.
