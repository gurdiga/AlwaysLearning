Unfortunately her grandmotherly concern did lead to much<br/>\nextra worrying on my part. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was hard to understand, and after she turned 3 her spoken<br/>\nvocabulary exploded. I made a conscious decision to very carefully<br/>\nlisten to her and try to always understand each word she was saying,<br/>\nso I could better understand her. I got to a 90+% comprehension with<br/>\nher, but by the time she was four the rest of the world probably got<br/>\nless than 50% of what she said. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I tried working with her at 3.5, with shaping her mouth properly<br/>\nto fix some of the pronunciation difficulties, she would just get mad<br/>\nat me, and insist she was getting the sound right. She wasn&#39;t ready<br/>\nfor intervention at that point. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt four I could see how frustrated she was when people didn&#39;t get what<br/>\nshe was trying to tell them.  And she wanted to talk to people<br/>\ndirectly, not have me do it for her. I asked her if she wanted to go<br/>\nto someone who could help her speak so that people could understand<br/>\nher better. She was very eager to try this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took about three months of effort on both our parts (I dropped the<br/>\ntherapist after two months) for her to overcome her speech problems.<br/>\nShe did not have a physical problem, and I suppose it may be important<br/>\nto start earlier if there is a physical problem (I don&#39;t know). For us<br/>\nwaiting till my daughter was 4yrs was really useful. She *wanted* the<br/>\nhelp by that point, so she progressed very quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, it was only *after* we were getting the help for my DD that my<br/>\nMIL casually mentioned how my DH had to get help to pronounce his &quot;S&quot;<br/>\nsounds when he was about my DD&#39;s age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is lots of help online.

He hadn&#39;t started talking as early as some children do, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have been bothered by that if other people hadn&#39;t said things that made me feel that something was wrong.  (Things like &quot;well you know, my daughter was talking at 6 months&quot;).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Well, the last straw was my mother-in-law.  She started telling me about all the children she knew or ever had known, and about how what I needed to do was have my son evaluated and start speech therapy as soon as possible, because the longer I waited the worse it would get and so on and so on.  By the way, she said these things in front of my son, which made me furious, even though I normally get along with her quite well.  Since she was a nurse, I paid attention to what she said, but I felt in my gut that she was wrong.  I did some internet research, and discovered that what my son was doing was normal, and he did not exhibit all of the signs of having a real problem.  Basically, his vocabulary was increasing faster than his tongue was able to pronounce the words, and he was trying to speak faster than he was able.  He is 9 now, and has no problem whatsoever.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing I read that may help you is that if you sense a speech issue, you should try to speak in a little slower pace, and speak very distinctly to your child. (Think about the way Mr. Rogers spoke).  Not unusually slow, but not as fast as maybe you normally speak.  It sounds as though your son is trying to say things and he knows what he is saying, it&#39;s just hard for you and others to understand.  Personally, I feel that this will work itself out over time, but I know how frustrating it is right now (especially dealing with others).  As long as you know that he understands you, and you are patient in trying to understand him, his ability to communicate will improve.  If however, you sense that a hearing problem is involved, or after some time passes you don&#39;t sense any improvement, by all means seek out professional opinions from more than one source.
