It would be like  <br/>\nusing high school drop outs as a way to measure the potential success  <br/>\nof unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost college graduates enter the work force in huge debt. Which, as  <br/>\nyou say: &quot;A person can live on a modest income as long as he or she  <br/>\nhas very little (or no) debt. Debt limits our freedoms, and makes us  <br/>\nslaves to the lender.&quot; Debt also makes us slaves to our jobs. College  <br/>\ngraduates have to get good paying jobs to pay off their debts. And to  <br/>\nkeep a good paying job one generally settles down and buys a house,  <br/>\nadding to the debt and tying one down further.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think outside the corporate world and middle class America,  <br/>\nthink outside the standard track, there are far more opportunities  <br/>\nfor jobs than most people think. Most people see the standard track  <br/>\nand if they aren&#39;t on it, they feel like they&#39;re stuck in low paying  <br/>\njobs. Just as many people feel like they&#39;ve limited their future by  <br/>\ndropping out of high school. But those who feel they&#39;ve freed  <br/>\nthemselves from chains that were holding them back are far more  <br/>\nlikely to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen college is seen as another way to explore what you&#39;re interested  <br/>\nin, rather than a bunch of expensive hoops to jump through to a good  <br/>\npaying job, it&#39;s even more valuable. But even better for some is the  <br/>\nfreedom to explore life beyond home on their own. It costs way less  <br/>\nthan a year of college for a kid to explore Europe on the cheap. And  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be picking up way more than they would from some overpriced  <br/>\ntextbooks ;-) They can spend four or more years after their &quot;high  <br/>\nschool years&quot; exploring all sorts of jobs, learning on the job --  <br/>\nwhile they get paid for it! And no reason they can&#39;t then go onto  <br/>\ncollege if they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost parents fear that if their kids don&#39;t go directly from high  <br/>\nschool to college that they won&#39;t. It&#39;s not unreasonable. After 12  <br/>\nyears, kids are burned out on school. It can take *years* to recover  <br/>\nfrom that.

She wasn&#39;t unschooled but was<br/>\nhome-schooled very informally and didn&#39;t take any school exams. When she<br/>\ndecided on midwifery in her early twenties she was able to take a one-year<br/>\ncourse at an adult education college which was all the qualification she<br/>\nneeded to start her degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was top of her year all the way through and was also elected student rep<br/>\nfor her year, so her lack of formal education and peer group socialisation<br/>\ndidn&#39;t exactly hold her back at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the UK there are several ways to get into university without academic<br/>\nqualifications, especially as a &#39;mature&#39; student - and there&#39;s the Open<br/>\nUniversity, which has very inclusive entry requirements, if you want a<br/>\ndegree but don&#39;t want to attend a regular college.
