I <br/>\n&gt;hope you&#39;re not expecting them not to learn.

I&#39;ve let go of expecting them to &quot;perform&quot; for me in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But when it comes to me being involved in things that they are interested <br/>\nin, they are still mostly choosing things that don&#39;t involve me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And what are you choosing? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m choosing to watch them do what they do. I haven&#39;t been choosing enough of just doing things which may or may not involve them. I&#39;ve also been choosing to learn as much as I can about unschooling so I can change my mindset and deschool myself. But there comes a point when I think you have to stop learning about unschooling and just start doing it. For example, I really like to paint and I love to look at painting books and imagine that I can paint these great pictures, but unless I start REALLY painting and making mistakes and trying to correct myself and get better, I know I&#39;ll never really be a painter. I know I need to start painting and also start unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes.  Get out of the house.  Go where you&#39;ve never been.  Take food.  Stay <br/>\n </span></blockquote>late.<br/>\n<br/>\nRent movies and watch them, with popcorn and GOOD sodas (or the equivalent of <br/>\nwhat your kids would like) and big pickles.  Pause and rewind as much as <br/>\nanyone wants to.  Let them walk away if they&#39;re bored.  Rentals can be <br/>\nwatched more than once before they have to go back, or can be taken back <br/>\nhalf-watched. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI get the idea. Thanks for the suggestions. I know I need to start DOING things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Loosening up expectations doesn&#39;t mean not having any.

It&#39;s the actual <br/>\nplaying, or real investigating that I don&#39;t get in to.<br/>\nMy dd has lots of great interests.  Is very into fashion through the <br/>\nages, which has lead to lots of differents interests of time periods <br/>\nand different countries and languages.  She loves old movies.  I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t always watch them with her.  Sometimes I do.  I still have 3 <br/>\nothers to care for though and it&#39;s not easy to watch a movie.  I do <br/>\nthe some of it here and there til I see the whole thing.

And at the <br/>\nextreme, some <br/>\n&gt; unschooling families take phrases like &quot;child led&quot; and think they <br/>\ncan just <br/>\n&gt; ignore the kids for days on end and they&#39;ll still be learning just <br/>\nas well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once in a chat, someone said &quot;how many hours a day does unschooling <br/>\ntake?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; One of us said &quot;none of them&quot; and another said &quot;all of them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does that mean twelve of them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What it means is that once it&#39;s working, you don&#39;t have some hours <br/>\nwhen you <br/>\n&gt; unschool and some when you don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t end.  But &quot;it&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>\nletting <br/>\n&gt; the kids try to learn all by themselves without the input or <br/>\nprodding or <br/>\n&gt; jollying or encouragement of people who know more than they do.  <br/>\nAnd that <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t always have to be the mom.  Part of &quot;doing it&quot; can be <br/>\nseeking out and <br/>\n&gt; appreciating the times your kids are in the company of other people <br/>\nwho know <br/>\n&gt; things they don&#39;t--other kids, older teens, other parents, whatever.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other night Holly watched a movie without me.  I was doing <br/>\nthings that <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t be done where she was.  I really would rather have watched <br/>\nit with <br/>\n&gt; her, because she would have questions she&#39;s not going to ask aloud <br/>\nif nobody <br/>\n&gt; else is in the room, and there were places in the movie I would <br/>\nhave <br/>\n&gt; commented on this or that.  So after her first session of watching <br/>\nit, I made <br/>\n&gt; myself go and watch it with her.  It took us four sittings, after <br/>\nall, to <br/>\n&gt; finish it, but it was better to watch it with her.  It <br/>\nwas &quot;Everybody Sing,&quot; <br/>\n&gt; a Judy Garland movie from the 30&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a lot to discuss in any old movie.  The good trick is <br/>\nfiguring out <br/>\n&gt; how much is too much to tell, and what the child wants to know or <br/>\nwould be <br/>\n&gt; interested in but just doesn&#39;t know it.  I could tie in litle bits <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; things she already knew.  She enjoyed pointing out similarities to <br/>\nthe Wizard <br/>\n&gt; of Oz (the actress who did Glenda, the Witch of the North, plays <br/>\nher mom in <br/>\n&gt; this one), and common elements with other 30&#39;s stuff we&#39;ve seen <br/>\nlately, which <br/>\n&gt; is lots.  It has been Depression month here, mostly coincidently, <br/>\nbut some <br/>\n&gt; because Holly loved the movie Paper Moon, and wanted some of the <br/>\nsongs.  Then <br/>\n&gt; I rented Top Hat so she could see Cheek to Cheek in context.  And I <br/>\nhad <br/>\n&gt; ordered Duck Soup to rent, just for me, and realized it was the <br/>\nsame period, <br/>\n&gt; and had some of the same elements too--fantasy sets, women dressed <br/>\nfabulously <br/>\n&gt; (as escapism for those who could barely afford a movie), exotic and <br/>\nfantasy <br/>\n&gt; locations.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not telling this to suggest people go and get those movies and <br/>\ncreate <br/>\n&gt; that interest.  The interest came first and gradually, but I built <br/>\non it.  It <br/>\n&gt; cost me $35 for the CD of songs (but if I&#39;d been wise in the ways <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; downloading songs and had a CD maker I could have done <br/>\ndifferently).  She has <br/>\n&gt; listened to it lots, and played it for guests, and learned lots of <br/>\nlyrics.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve rented a few movies I might not have otherwise.  $12.   We sat <br/>\none day <br/>\n&gt; eating lunch, watching a crew working on a new store they&#39;re <br/>\nputting in near <br/>\n&gt; us.  Brick layers, concrete pouring.  We parked and watched them <br/>\nlike a <br/>\n&gt; drive-in, and she asked questions about the Great Depression, and I <br/>\ntold her <br/>\n&gt; stories I&#39;d heard from grandparents and an elderly teacher.  We <br/>\ntalked about <br/>\n&gt; these guys, who were working in a light snow, and how unemployed <br/>\nthey would <br/>\n&gt; have been in the 30&#39;s.  She said if SHE had been mayor, she would <br/>\nhave made <br/>\n&gt; it illegal to wear shoes, so people without shoes wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nfelt bad.  <br/>\n&gt; And she would have sold all the shoes and redistributed the money.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holly never saw any pre-rubber-soul shoes all worn out, from those <br/>\ndays, so I <br/>\n&gt; kept my mental picture to myself.  But I asked who would buy the <br/>\nshoes?  Even <br/>\n&gt; now, used shoes don&#39;t sell for more than five or ten dollars a <br/>\npair, and in <br/>\n&gt; those days a nickel was real money you could buy food with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No pre-fab lesson on the Depression would have gone to just the <br/>\npoint in her <br/>\n&gt; thinking where she was.  I had to deal with her, directly, with the <br/>\nquestions <br/>\n&gt; and ideas she was having.  At one point my food was done and I was <br/>\ngetting <br/>\n&gt; cold, and I started the car and started to back out.  She <br/>\nsaid &quot;Where are we <br/>\n&gt; going!?  I&#39;m still having fun.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I said sorry, I was getting cold.  So I turned the engine and <br/>\nheater on, and <br/>\n&gt; we stayed until she said we should go.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I&#39;d had a good reason to leave right then, she would have <br/>\nunderstood.  I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t, and she wanted to stay a while, and so I understood.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday we went to a play, a travelling group doing a show for <br/>\nschool <br/>\n&gt; groups.  It was a musical of The Boxcar Children.  It started off <br/>\ntalking <br/>\n&gt; about the Great Depression.  The Wednesday before, we got backstage <br/>\ntours of <br/>\n&gt; the Albuquerque Little Theatre (separate tours, as it turns out &lt;g&gt;-<br/>\n-she was <br/>\n&gt; with the homeschooling group, and I found old friends of mine were <br/>\nworking on <br/>\n&gt; sets).  It was built by the WPA.  Of all the kids in that group of <br/>\n21 kids, <br/>\n&gt; Holly probably knew and cared more about what that meant than <br/>\nanyone.  On the <br/>\n&gt; way home we talked about the construction jobs, the clerical and <br/>\nacting and <br/>\n&gt; directing jobs, and the relief from fear and boredom that going to <br/>\na play <br/>\n&gt; would have meant for other people too, in those days.   And there <br/>\nthe theatre <br/>\n&gt; still stood, still being used. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can&#39;t plan months like we&#39;re having.

I have shown as much interest as I can in their gameboys and in the TV shows they like. If I point something out to them that I find interesting or that I think they might find interesting, they acted annoyed and uninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may have happened because I have been homeschooling them for the past 5 years. The thought of a nice, secure, comfortable curriculum is so soothing to me. Something that I would have LOVED to do when I was their age. Just do the required lessons every day and you will learn everything you need to know to have a good education, right? It&#39;s all spelled out, broken down into easy-to-follow instructions. Well, I tried to pass along those feelings of following a curriculum to my boys from the start and they have fought me and resisted just about every single thing. When I started, that&#39;s what I believed homeschooling was all about. What did I know about educating my kids? I HAD to search elsewhere for guidance in telling me what to learn when and how to learn it. But the trouble was that my boys never just went along with it all. Whenever I tried to introduce a new thing to learn about, they rejected it and made it very clear that they were not going to be these perfect homeschooling students. So I&#39;m afraid that now that we are unschooling, we are still in this sort of pattern. Did I cause harm to my boys by trying to homeschool them for the past few years? Sometimes I wonder if I have somehow ruined my relationship with them and they won&#39;t invite me in to their learning world because of the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they are still deschooling from my homeschooling them? These past 5 months I have completely let go of all learning expectations and they are free to do whatever they want to all day. Like I said, that has been mostly playing gameboys and computer games all day and watching TV in between. Sometimes we have gone to the park (at their request) and they still are involved in their homeschooling group activities, which they really love. But when it comes to me being involved in things that they are interested in, they are still mostly choosing things that don&#39;t involve me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I already know what I need to do. I need to stop expecting them to want to &quot;learn&quot; about things and instead just invite them to DO more things with me. Like play more games, go for walks or hiking, and just to reestablish a newer &quot;unschooling&quot; relationship with them, which I think I don&#39;t have yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem I have with my younger son is his ideas about being in grades. He would be in 3rd grade right now, if he were in school. He tells me (recently) that he wants to be in 4th grade. In his mind, he is in whatever grade level that is says on the books he is working on. For example, he is about 1/2 was through the Saxon 3rd grade math book. (this is where he was when we started unschooling - he has worked on about 10 pages - his choice - since we started). Well, he wants to finish that book so that he can start on the Saxon 54 book (the next level) and &quot;be&quot; in 4th grade. How do I, or even &#39;should&#39; I, explain to him that he doesn&#39;t need to rely on school grades any more? Apparantly they still mean a lot to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling was hard for us because my boys flat out refused to comply with doing the work. And now I&#39;m feeling that unschooling is much more suitable for us, just for the fact that there is more peace in the house and my relationship has definitely improved with my kids since I&#39;m not demanding things of them anymore. But I think we still have not evolved to a nice flow of an unschooling household yet. Or maybe we are on our way and have just not arrived there yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling is hard work?","postDate":"1013538147","msgId":4678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhkLjEzY2Q2NmVmLjI5OWFiNzYzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4675,"nextInTopic":4681,"prevInTime":4677,"nextInTime":4679,"topicId":4636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/12/02 10:57:18 AM, pamhartley@mindspring.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-422295545\">In a message dated 2/12/02 10:57:18 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe it&#39;s a personality thing?

But it is the opposite - it takes HUGE parental effort<br/>\n- constant awareness of each child&#39;s interests and needs and possibilities.<br/>\nIt means always carrying that awareness around with you everywhere so that<br/>\nyou&#39;re always making connections and noticing things that might be something<br/>\nuseful for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have difficulties in assigning words like &quot;hard work&quot; and &quot;huge effort&quot; to<br/>\nunschooling.

And at the extreme, some <br/>\nunschooling families take phrases like &quot;child led&quot; and think they can just <br/>\nignore the kids for days on end and they&#39;ll still be learning just as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in a chat, someone said &quot;how many hours a day does unschooling take?&quot;  <br/>\nOne of us said &quot;none of them&quot; and another said &quot;all of them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean twelve of them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means is that once it&#39;s working, you don&#39;t have some hours when you <br/>\nunschool and some when you don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t end.  But &quot;it&quot; isn&#39;t letting <br/>\nthe kids try to learn all by themselves without the input or prodding or <br/>\njollying or encouragement of people who know more than they do.  And that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always have to be the mom.  Part of &quot;doing it&quot; can be seeking out and <br/>\nappreciating the times your kids are in the company of other people who know <br/>\nthings they don&#39;t--other kids, older teens, other parents, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night Holly watched a movie without me.  I was doing things that <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be done where she was.  I really would rather have watched it with <br/>\nher, because she would have questions she&#39;s not going to ask aloud if nobody <br/>\nelse is in the room, and there were places in the movie I would have <br/>\ncommented on this or that.  So after her first session of watching it, I made <br/>\nmyself go and watch it with her.  It took us four sittings, after all, to <br/>\nfinish it, but it was better to watch it with her.  It was &quot;Everybody Sing,&quot; <br/>\na Judy Garland movie from the 30&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot to discuss in any old movie.  The good trick is figuring out <br/>\nhow much is too much to tell, and what the child wants to know or would be <br/>\ninterested in but just doesn&#39;t know it.  I could tie in litle bits with <br/>\nthings she already knew.  She enjoyed pointing out similarities to the Wizard <br/>\nof Oz (the actress who did Glenda, the Witch of the North, plays her mom in <br/>\nthis one), and common elements with other 30&#39;s stuff we&#39;ve seen lately, which <br/>\nis lots.  It has been Depression month here, mostly coincidently, but some <br/>\nbecause Holly loved the movie Paper Moon, and wanted some of the songs.  Then <br/>\nI rented Top Hat so she could see Cheek to Cheek in context.  And I had <br/>\nordered Duck Soup to rent, just for me, and realized it was the same period, <br/>\nand had some of the same elements too--fantasy sets, women dressed fabulously <br/>\n(as escapism for those who could barely afford a movie), exotic and fantasy <br/>\nlocations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not telling this to suggest people go and get those movies and create <br/>\nthat interest.  The interest came first and gradually, but I built on it.  It <br/>\ncost me $35 for the CD of songs (but if I&#39;d been wise in the ways of <br/>\ndownloading songs and had a CD maker I could have done differently).  She has <br/>\nlistened to it lots, and played it for guests, and learned lots of lyrics.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve rented a few movies I might not have otherwise.  $12.   We sat one day <br/>\neating lunch, watching a crew working on a new store they&#39;re putting in near <br/>\nus.  Brick layers, concrete pouring.  We parked and watched them like a <br/>\ndrive-in, and she asked questions about the Great Depression, and I told her <br/>\nstories I&#39;d heard from grandparents and an elderly teacher.  We talked about <br/>\nthese guys, who were working in a light snow, and how unemployed they would <br/>\nhave been in the 30&#39;s.  She said if SHE had been mayor, she would have made <br/>\nit illegal to wear shoes, so people without shoes wouldn&#39;t have felt bad.  <br/>\nAnd she would have sold all the shoes and redistributed the money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly never saw any pre-rubber-soul shoes all worn out, from those days, so I <br/>\nkept my mental picture to myself.  But I asked who would buy the shoes?  Even <br/>\nnow, used shoes don&#39;t sell for more than five or ten dollars a pair, and in <br/>\nthose days a nickel was real money you could buy food with.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo pre-fab lesson on the Depression would have gone to just the point in her <br/>\nthinking where she was.  I had to deal with her, directly, with the questions <br/>\nand ideas she was having.  At one point my food was done and I was getting <br/>\ncold, and I started the car and started to back out.  She said &quot;Where are we <br/>\ngoing!?  I&#39;m still having fun.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI said sorry, I was getting cold.  So I turned the engine and heater on, and <br/>\nwe stayed until she said we should go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d had a good reason to leave right then, she would have understood.

The Wednesday before, we got backstage tours of <br/>\nthe Albuquerque Little Theatre (separate tours, as it turns out &lt;g&gt;--she was <br/>\nwith the homeschooling group, and I found old friends of mine were working on <br/>\nsets).  It was built by the WPA.  Of all the kids in that group of 21 kids, <br/>\nHolly probably knew and cared more about what that meant than anyone.  On the <br/>\nway home we talked about the construction jobs, the clerical and acting and <br/>\ndirecting jobs, and the relief from fear and boredom that going to a play <br/>\nwould have meant for other people too, in those days.   And there the theatre <br/>\nstill stood, still being used. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t plan months like we&#39;re having.
