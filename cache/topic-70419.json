We tried Miralax, Milk of Mag (with some success). The Milk of Mag was very bad tasting, and my son would practically gag. He generally wouldn&#39;t take that. Miralax not so bad, but it didn&#39;t work as consistently either.The doctor at one point suggested mineral oil in juice. It doesn&#39;t change the taste, but does change the consistency of the juice. We tried it, and he was able to go and feel better after a bit. For a while after, he was taking a spoonful of mineral oil in juice every night, to help with avoiding constipation and encopresis. This seemed to stop the cycle he&#39;d gotten in, where he&#39;d have a painful movement, then avoid going until he was very backed up again, have another painful one, etc...The mineral oil just helped it to be easier, so he had successful pain free bowel movements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve stopped doing it as a general thing. Now he will let us know if he&#39;s getting backed up and ask for some mineral oil for a few days. It isn&#39;t an instant cure, but if your son doesn&#39;t mind the consistency, it might help him to be able to go more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son doesn&#39;t have as much difficulty now, and he is more active, that&#39;s true. But when he was very constipated, he had little interest in being active. We used to try to encourage him to go for a walk when he was very constipated. But his belly hurt, he was lethargic and felt lousy. The last thing he wanted to do was go do something away from home (and away from our own bathroom, if the urge came). Instead, we let him to jump on our bed if he was up for it. I think knowingÂ  his bathroom was right there for him was a comfort. We made sure to keep his favorite comic books in there for him.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"dezignarob","from":"&quot;dezignarob&quot; &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: I want to break out of this pattern.","postDate":"1360716043","msgId":70525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtmZW5lYitrM2s5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70524,"nextInTopic":70532,"prevInTime":70524,"nextInTime":70526,"topicId":70419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==== Today I found myself feeling lost.

I told my son that I miss him and although I enjoy connecting with him on things he is passionate about, I would like to share with him things I&#39;m passionate about. I asked him if we could schedule a hike in our week to do together. He looked at our chalkboard calendar and pointed at Friday and I immediately wrote it in. ===<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can&#39;t be an even handed, tit-for-tat, equal relationship between a mom and an 8 year old, where you take turns sharing a passion back and forth. You aren&#39;t equals emotionally or developmentally.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you actually &quot;passionate&quot; about hiking? It sounded earlier like it was something you considered a means to an end (exercise for digestion). I know some people are - my step-mother-in-law was. She went hiking just about daily for 5+ hours in the Hollywood Hills or wherever they happened to be, as part of her rigorous fitness regimen. She was childless. Her husband sometimes felt neglected, to judge from his grumpy remarks about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would be cautious about describing your interest as a &quot;passion&quot;, IF that is too strong a term for what is really just a pleasant hobby. It can sometimes sound like an unschooling buzzword - we talk about our kids&#39; passions. I think part of it is as an antidote to the conventional parents&#39; dismissiveness or minimizing of children&#39;s interests, and partly as an acknowledgement of the fierceness of their emotional attachment, focus and enjoyment of their favorite pastimes - even if it only lasts a short while.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you spend a lot of time in the company of younger children, if you are nannying part of the time as well as parenting. I wonder if you are subconsciously relying on your son to fulfill your emotional needs for connection. That is a lot of pressure to put on a child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was 8 she was utterly incapable of making a bargain in the future and sticking to it. She is only now at 13 coming close to being able to look 5 days into the future and make a commitment to an activity. I am worried that this Friday hiking appointment is a disaster waiting to happen. I&#39;m wondering if he looked at the calendar and said a day as far away as was practical - because as an 8 year old he lives in the now, and now he wanted Mom to quit bugging him about her stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were Jayn, and Friday morning rolled around, chances are she would prefer to continue playing her games, skyping with her friends or laying in bed looking up funny memes on her phone. I could develop a resentment that she wasn&#39;t keeping her commitment and either express it and cause crankiness, or suppress it and feel lousy. Or I could consider this plan to be something fluid, something offered to her without obligation, and enjoy my hike on my own if she had changed her mind, and be delighted if she had not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn spends a lot of time doing her own thing, and asking for privacy. Then when she feels the lack of connection herself, she voluntarily chooses to spend time with me, telling me about her games, running errands, cuddling, watching our favorite shows or even going for a walk together. I make myself available to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say spend time with your 4 year old, while you have the chance to do so, and be available for your 8 year old. There may come a time when they both want you at once, and you will have a tougher time.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== I also have a 4 yo that is in need of my attention, a partner and a house that I manage. I have little time for myself. <br/>\n <br/>\nHow do I manage with out going to a time schedule?===<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking out an organized schedule for yourself, such as planning a good day to do the laundry, or adding specific tasks to your own weekly calendar, is one thing, probably a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nImposing a schedule of how many hours one of your kids should do any particular activity, including having Mom&#39;s passions foisted on them, would probably build a pretty big unschooling road block. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== How do I detach from the members of my family with out the guilt of doing something for myself? ===<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it depends on what you want to do for yourself. When you say &quot;detach&quot; do you mean leave them in the care of others, while you do something out of the house? What about that hike you mentioned? I like to walk - I go around the block, sometimes twice for at least 40 minutes. Usually I am alone, and I find it refreshing and bracing. I did a lot less solitary walking when Jayn was 8, even less when she was 4. She got older, and I got more time to focus on my own work and interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day she won&#39;t be in the next room, and I will have even more time.

I still have asked a few times if he feels he needs to sit on the toilet and he has gone and come out disappointed that he hasn&#39;t had any movement. I have talked to him about being active so his intestines become more active. I have encouraged a midday hike together and he declines it and goes back to stimulating his mind and engaging with his passion. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I found myself feeling lost. I told my son that I miss him and although I enjoy connecting with him on things he is passionate about, I would like to share with him things I&#39;m passionate about.

He looked at our chalkboard calendar and pointed at Friday and I immediately wrote it in. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can only handle as much computer as I can process.

She also has frequent accidents (both urine and BM). When these happen I help her clean up and move on. We are also seeing a play therapist that helps with the emotional scars from public school (she was in school until this January when I began the deschooling process - but that&#39;s for another post). She also drinks water throughout the day (she has her own special cup that lights up), and has the freedom to go whenever she needs to. These things have all helped with that issue. I never bully, berade, coerce, or try to force her to go. That just enhances the problem. Let go, and soon your child will too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the hygene: She refuses to brush her hair (it hurts because it pulls). She rarely brushes her teeth, and she voluntarily bathes maybe once a week.

A few things that I have learned about her- she needs a LONG time on the toilet and something to get her mind off what she&#39;s doing.  I think for her, sometimes, she feels pressured to go- much like I feel at the doctor if I have to pee in a cup. When she was little enough, we&#39;d put her potty seat in front of the tv and let her watch a movie. That was the only way she could go. Now she either takes one of our phones or the tablet and watches Netflix or plays games. If I try to rush her, she&#39;ll say, &quot;Mom, I really think I might need to poop.&quot; Sure enough, a half hour later, she&#39;ll go. For her, it has to be first thing in the morning. She hates stopping what she is doing during the day. She usually wakes up slowly, playing on the tablet while she&#39;s still in bed. Then after a while, I&#39;ll suggestion going taking the tablet to the bathroom with her. When we first started relaxing about her going, I&#39;d suggest she just sit for a bit and see what happens- making sure she knew it was her choice when to get up. She&#39;d end up getting lost in the movie/game and sit long enough to go. Also, she has to be home to go. She can&#39;t do it in a store or someone else&#39;s house. If we have a few days in a row where we are out and about, she will get very constipated. It can&#39;t always be helped, but I know she will need a ton of apple juice for a few days and possibly a new game on the tablet. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Trisha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":254796796,"authorName":"Virginia Warren","from":"Virginia Warren &lt;vafnord@...&gt;","profile":"vafnord23","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I want to break out of this pattern.","postDate":"1359761798","msgId":70444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBS1g5OGZpcFFwOUZBRmg9Y2diVk4tWHZEamZiR0d3OUhGclI1T2FrcXJ1SG0wcmFWZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDM0I5OTk5LTI1MUYtNDg4MS05NkMwLUM3QkY2M0IzQkRBQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEFDM0I5OTk5LTI1MUYtNDg4MS05NkMwLUM3QkY2M0IzQkRBQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":70443,"nextInTopic":70445,"prevInTime":70443,"nextInTime":70445,"topicId":70419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter just turned 8.

He has had such a difficult time having a BM since he was a baby, 6 months old. It started as what the medical Doctors called &quot;breastmilk colitis&quot; with bloody stools, and lead into a withholding pattern. We have tried so many different things: Diet changes, charts/calendars, potty practice, suppositories,  &quot;poop&quot; books, magnesium, incentives. We have talked about what goes in must come out and what happens when it doesn&#39;t, drawn diagrams,. I thought it was because we sat too long on the computer so we had limited that, thought it was food, controlled that. Let go of both of those things as the &quot;problem&quot; and moved passed that. He goes when he wants to and in the mean time I worry. We have been encouraging a potty practice every evening until things have straightend out. This causes unnecessary power struggles and I hate it as much as he does. I fear if I don&#39;t say anything he won&#39;t listen to his body cues and hold it in until he gets severely constipated to the point of causing a fissure that sets him up again for withholding.He has withheld for up to 3 weeks. I have a calendar that I use to keep track of when I take my vitamins (as I tend to forget if I have taken them during the day) I have also used the same calendar to keep track of his BM&#39;s, more for me than him as it stresses me...and I know my stress probably stresses him and causes withholding too. If I don&#39;t say anything he may not make the choice to go until he is writhing in pain. Is that what needs to happen for change to happen for him. Do I just let go and be there for him in this capacity until he finds his way? It is heartbreaking and really painful for him. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to break out of this pattern.

My partner works from home. I nanny 3 days a week outside of the home and our 2 children have a choice most of the time to stay home or come. We have let go of the many ideas that were set forth by our parents and struggle with others. Our days are guided by our individual desires and I try to keep new things flowing so we can explore new passions that come our way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have done what we call &quot;night time rituals&quot;, brushing teeth, bathing, and pottying, since infancy. I don&#39;t believe it ever worked for anyone other than me because it is something that I learned as a child I had to do. I changed the name and tried to make it fun...but it was always resisted. I see this as control and I want to change that and facilitate learning to take care of our own bodies. How do I do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4 year old loves bathing, potties when she needs to, does not care to brush her teeth.We have been to the dentist and had terrible experiences which I understand may be deterring her from wanting to brush. I encourage brushing when I go into brush in the morning and most evenings. I have let go of this. Her teeth aren&#39;t causing her pain, she is happy, and when the time comes when she is better equipped to sit in a dental chair she may be ready to take care of her teeth better. She does brush just not as frequently as I do. We&#39;ve let go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old bathes sporadically, brushes teeth maybe every other day, and has what I would call a difficult time with bowel movements. He has had such a difficult time having a BM since he was a baby, 6 months old. It started as what the medical Doctors called &quot;breastmilk colitis&quot; with bloody stools, and lead into a withholding pattern. We have tried so many different things: Diet changes, charts/calendars, potty practice, suppositories,  &quot;poop&quot; books, magnesium, incentives. We have talked about what goes in must come out and what happens when it doesn&#39;t, drawn diagrams,. I thought it was because we sat too long on the computer so we had limited that, thought it was food, controlled that. Let go of both of those things as the &quot;problem&quot; and moved passed that. He goes when he wants to and in the mean time I worry. We have been encouraging a potty practice every evening until things have straightend out. This causes unnecessary power struggles and I hate it as much as he does. I fear if I don&#39;t say anything he won&#39;t listen to his body cues and hold it in until he gets severely constipated to the point of causing a fissure that sets him up again for withholding.He has withheld for up to 3 weeks. I have a calendar that I use to keep track of when I take my vitamins (as I tend to forget if I have taken them during the day) I have also used the same calendar to keep track of his BM&#39;s, more for me than him as it stresses me...and I know my stress probably stresses him and causes withholding too. If I don&#39;t say anything he may not make the choice to go until he is writhing in pain. Is that what needs to happen for change to happen for him. Do I just let go and be there for him in this capacity until he finds his way? It is heartbreaking and really painful for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to break out of this pattern. I want to help guide and not control. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nPhoebe</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70570,"nextTopicId":70573}}
