Cali is <br/>\nvery expensive compared to the rest of camping in america.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in Albuquerque is the National Atomic Museum <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atomicmuseum.com/)\">http://www.atomicmuseum.com/)</a> and the Sandia Tramway  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandiapeak.com/\">http://www.sandiapeak.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI use mapquest.com to layout my route and measure distances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re going through Kentucky, hit Cave City and visit Mammoth Cave <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nps.gov/maca/)\">http://www.nps.gov/maca/)</a>.

It&#39;s the highest bridge in <br/>\nthe US and second highest in the world. :)  It&#39;s also fun to drive the <br/>\ncrookedy road down to the original bridge and raft or kayak if you <br/>\nhave time or fly over the gorge.  I did this with five dollar frank <br/>\ntwenty years ago.  I&#39;m kind of doubting he&#39;s still around. :(  But <br/>\nmaybe his crazy museum still is.

Worth.  They have a major waterpark there if you&#39;re into <br/>\nthat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n70 is another east west route that has the St. Louis Arch on it, but <br/>\nanywhere you cross the Mississippi make time to stop and look and see <br/>\nif you can camp overnight there.
