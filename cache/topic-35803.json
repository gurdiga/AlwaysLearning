She is 8 (or will be in about 3 weeks) and I believe<br/>\nshe reads at or above her level (whatever that means), but really don&#39;t know<br/>\nin honesty. I think the reason that I get this comment (Wow! She reads<br/>\nreally well for her age) is because she looks younger than she is (many<br/>\npeople think she is 6).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the situation left me wondering what to say to someone that tells me<br/>\nthat she reads well. I know that &quot;She taught herself&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;appropriate&quot; if<br/>\nyou ask Sandra (lol), but with others outside the unschooling world, it<br/>\nseems like the best answer I can come up with. A couple times it has sparked<br/>\na conversation and sometimes I hope the little things (like that or like<br/>\nseeing the girls out and about with us during school hours or seeing that we<br/>\ntreat our girls like we love them instead of like they are burdens (which<br/>\nhappens a lot when you ride the city bus around here)) will enlighten<br/>\npeople.
