For some Christians, courtship means an<br/>\n&gt; approach to marriage that is almost the same thing as an arranged marriage.<br/>\n&gt; Your parents pick your future mate and there is hardly any one-on-one contact<br/>\n&gt; before marriage. For others, it means the same thing as a serious dating<br/>\n&gt; relationship. You decide to court someone when you are thinking about perhaps<br/>\n&gt; marrying that person.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still others use the term &quot;courtship&quot; to describe a set of biblical principles<br/>\n&gt; that Christians should follow in their approach to romance. These principles<br/>\n&gt; usually include: 1) Seeking and receiving the approval of parents before<br/>\n&gt; entering into a romantic relationship; 2) Waiting to start a serious<br/>\n&gt; relationship until you are at the age where you could consider getting<br/>\n&gt; married; 3) Entering into the relationship with the purpose of pursuing the<br/>\n&gt; idea of marriage, not just going out for fun with no serious intentions; and<br/>\n&gt; 4) Setting high standards for physical purity.<br/>\n&gt; I think that the four principles listed above are important for every<br/>\n&gt; Christian to follow. Whether you want to call it courtship or dating doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; matter. The principles are what&#39;s important. For more info on why they&#39;re so<br/>\n&gt; important, check out my previous columns about relationships in my archives. I<br/>\n&gt; almost always include a discussion on at least one of these four principles<br/>\n&gt; when I write about relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90721915,"authorName":"Susan McGlohn","from":"Susan McGlohn &lt;eclectichomeschooler@...&gt;","profile":"eclectichomeschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Solstice Celebrations","postDate":"1008306684","msgId":664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjE0MDUxMTI0LjQyNzY4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0OTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWMxODQ1OCQ0ZDA1ZDFhMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":663,"nextInTopic":668,"prevInTime":663,"nextInTime":665,"topicId":633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He got <br/>\nmarried just over a year ago at age 19 to a 16yo homeschooler. They are <br/>\nexpecting their first baby in February (and no, she wasn&#39;t preganant <br/>\nwhen they got married &lt;g&gt;). They have been in love since he was 16 and <br/>\nshe was 13. Dated other people, but always came back to each other. We <br/>\naren&#39;t christians. When I suggested that they could live together for <br/>\nawhile before getting married (like dh and I did) I was given a <br/>\nwithering look that made me feel like a dirty old woman! Well, I guess <br/>\nthey all have to go through their rebellious stage! But somehow though <br/>\nit seemed natural to rebel against my parents back at the end of the <br/>\nsixties, I hadn&#39;t considered that my kids might go prudish on me &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nEspecially considering they were into partying and drink and Having Fun. <br/>\nSince getting pregnant though, it&#39;s back to the family values. No more <br/>\nsmoking, drinking. Any suggestions of hospital births, vaccination or <br/>\nschool for their precious baby are shot down in flames!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey seem very happy. All I can do is hope it lasts. Erin&#39;s mother was <br/>\nonly just 17 when she got married, and had her first son a year later. <br/>\nThey are still happily married with six kids. So here&#39;s hoping. I do <br/>\nlove them both :-) And I am looking forward to the home birth of my <br/>\ngrandchild, to which I have been invited :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t answer any of your questions except that, yes, I am <br/>\nuncomfortable about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90721915,"authorName":"Susan McGlohn","from":"Susan McGlohn &lt;eclectichomeschooler@...&gt;","profile":"eclectichomeschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teenage Issues","postDate":"1008285651","msgId":643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjEzMjMyMDUxLjQ0ODE2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0OTEzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDMTkzNERCLjEwNDA1MDlAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":642,"nextInTopic":644,"prevInTime":642,"nextInTime":644,"topicId":633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

SO... if we devalue college, as <br/>\nunschooling parents, and say &quot;whatever&quot; and &quot;whenever&quot; about a hundred <br/>\nthings, then what&#39;s the bar/deadline/magic threshhold for kids to consider <br/>\nbonding for life?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave we brought this on ourselves?<br/>\n<br/>\n(And is it really happening?  I&#39;ve written all the above on the assumption <br/>\nthat &quot;it&quot; is a fact, but I&#39;m not sure it is.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90721915,"authorName":"eclectichomeschooler","from":"&quot;eclectichomeschooler&quot; &lt;eclectichomeschooler@...&gt;","profile":"eclectichomeschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Teenage Issues","postDate":"1008277344","msgId":634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl2YjUxMCs2N2FoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Yi41YWQ1NzU1LjI5NGE2YzEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":633,"nextInTopic":635,"prevInTime":633,"nextInTime":635,"topicId":633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... any ... happening among ... where one ...

My <br/>\nbrother&#39;s best friend was the son of an Indian Sikh father and a <br/>\nMalaysian mother.  The parents, years earlier, had fallen in love and <br/>\nmarried - definitely not an arranged marriage!  They moved to NY when <br/>\ntheir son was still a little boy so he grew up in a very western <br/>\nenvironment.  Both his parents were very well-educated and were really <br/>\nvery sophisticated people and very comfortable in our society.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe grew up to be a personable, intelligent and handsome young man.  <br/>\nFollowing  his formal education he moved to Hawaii and started dating.  <br/>\nAfter a few years, he decided he wanted to get married, but had not <br/>\nfound anyone special.  So, he asked his parents if they would go to <br/>\nIndia and choose a wife for him!  They were thrilled to do this for <br/>\nhim.  They travelled to India and met with several families where they <br/>\nwere introduced to some young ladies.  They found a young woman that <br/>\nthey thought would be suitable for him, the arrangements were made and <br/>\nthey got married.  That was about 13 years ago.  They have 3 kids and <br/>\nare very happily married.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thrilled that this worked out for them, but I always thought that <br/>\nwas such a strange story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, December 13, 2001, at 05:08 PM, KT wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Courtship and arranged marriages are more a fundamentalist/charismatic<br/>\n&gt; thing than strictly in the evangelical camp.  It&#39;s been featured in<br/>\n&gt; Focus on the Family&#39;s magazine...and didn&#39;t that guy Josh McSomebody<br/>\n&gt; write a book about it?  I think the title was &quot;I kissed dating goodbye&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or something like that. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with Sandra, that it is spreading.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan McGlohn wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arranged marriages.  It&#39;s the coming thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;And sources to point me to?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard this a lot as well. . . when I lived in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Louisiana, a lot of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talk amongst the Christian/Catholic homeschoolers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was that their daughters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t need college as they would only be getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; married and having children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as soon as they finished &quot;high school&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;arranged marriages&quot;.  It just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sounds like the parent&#39;s wishes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am a Christian in a huge protestant evangelical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; church here in VA, and although courtship is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; definitely encouraged, I have not heard a thing about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arranged marriages within the Christian community.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s too bad that generalizations are applied across<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the board to an entire group of people, based on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practice of a few individuals/subgroups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &gt; {}<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Susan  c[__]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eclectichomeschooler@...\">eclectichomeschooler@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; AOL IM:  WifeToVegman<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my web page:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html\">http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check out Yahoo!
