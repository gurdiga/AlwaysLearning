It was a very long <br/>\npage. Research has shown that as a website visitor scrolls down a <br/>\nlong page on their computer screen the likely effect is that their <br/>\nbrain waves will slow down and the person reading the page will go <br/>\nfrom normal alertness into a light trance. Without noticing. The same <br/>\nas we can go into a light trance when passively watching a TV <br/>\nprogramme. If we&#39;ve been surfing the web, the chances are we&#39;re <br/>\nalready in a light trance when we arrive at the website. Internet <br/>\nmarketers know this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our brain waves are slowed down and we&#39;re in a trance <br/>\n(a &#39;buying trance&#39;, the marketing gurus call it), we&#39;re susceptible <br/>\nto hypnotic suggestion. And this sales letter in question was not, in <br/>\nfact, a sales letter - as in, here&#39;s the product, here&#39;s how it will <br/>\nbenefit you and why I think you should buy it. The sales page was a <br/>\ndisguised hypnosis script. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the opening part of the sales letter was to make me <br/>\nfeel depressed. I don&#39;t have the letter here to refer to, but it was <br/>\nessentially a guided imagery session. Exactly like a hypnotherapist <br/>\nmight use with a client, only this had a negative intent. &quot;I wonder <br/>\nif you&#39;ve ever noticed how tired you feel at the end of the day.&quot; <br/>\nThis is like saying &quot;I wonder if you&#39;ve ever thought of a white cat.&quot; <br/>\nChances are, you have now. &quot;Perhaps there is something in your life <br/>\nthat&#39;s not quite right.&quot; And that &quot;something&quot; would be what? Whatever <br/>\nyou think of. Absolutely anything that you perceive as &quot;not quite <br/>\nright&quot; in your personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the way the letter went on; and then it gets to the part where <br/>\nyou&#39;ve hopefully recalled into your awareness (without realising it) <br/>\nsome of the undoubtedly millions of little things that have &#39;gone <br/>\nwrong&#39; in your life, and you&#39;re thinking, without really knowing <br/>\nwhy, &quot;Well, maybe my life isn&#39;t so great at the moment.&quot; The next <br/>\npart is to ramp up your negative thoughts to Chicken Little <br/>\nproportions by relating them to the bigger picture. &quot;There&#39;s so much <br/>\ndepression in the world today. Latest research shows that teen <br/>\nsuicides are up by 400% over the past ten years ...&quot; and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re Zig Ziglar, or somebody like him, all of this so far will <br/>\nhave bounced off you. But you&#39;re not in the target market. If you&#39;re <br/>\nin the target market, you should be feeling a bit low right now. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the intention.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThen comes the &#39;solution&#39; to your &#39;problem&#39;. This guy&#39;s e-book. Only <br/>\nit&#39;s not offering you relief from how you felt before marketing let <br/>\nyou know the book was out there; it&#39;s offering you relief from how <br/>\nthe marketing itself made you feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarketing gurus talk about these &#39;black hat&#39; techniques behind closed <br/>\ndoors - NLP, covert hypnosis and so on - at $5,000 a ticket seminars.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to really know how effective they are, because the gurus <br/>\npuff them up to sell the tickets to their seminars in the first <br/>\nplace. NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) is regularly touted as a <br/>\nskill that will give you the power to hypnotise anyone into doing <br/>\nanything without them realising what&#39;s going on, as if all you have <br/>\nto do is the equivalent of dangling a watch in somebody&#39;s face and <br/>\nthey&#39;re immediately at your bidding. Real hypnotists will tell you it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work like that. But it does work. And everybody can be <br/>\nhypnotised.

Its alot easier to make poor judgements and have knee-jerk <br/>\nreactions. But part of being and unschooler means I&#39;m working on <br/>\nthat - learning new skills, new ways of thinking, different ways of <br/>\nmanaging my time and energy, and getting help when I need it, so <br/>\nthat I *can* be the thoughtful, engaged parent I want to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids see me learning those skills and benefit from that process. <br/>\nThey get to experience a more generally thoughful family environment <br/>\nthan...well, more thoughtful than what *I* grew up with, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n*One* way they get to experience that has to do with advertising. <br/>\nFor example, I don&#39;t respond to &quot;that looks really cool&quot; with &quot;well, <br/>\nyou&#39;re not getting it&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t really want that&quot;.
