We have a lot of great things for him at home. His Legos, the computer, iPad, TV, books, games, robot making, painting, drawing, book-making. We live on the second floor of a condo, and the days we stay home, Logan burns his energy noisily in the house. I don&#39;t mind it, and no neighbor complaints, but when it gets late a night and I ask him to play quieter and he gets frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost days he refuses to leave the house, if we do go out, he has fun and is glad he did it.<br/>\nWe have had some great adventures.<br/>\nWe live in NYC where there are so many amazing things to do. We cater our outdoor suggestions to his interests. He wants to be an astronaut, so we suggest the Planetarium, likes the big cats, so we offer the zoo as two examples. The only sure fire way he will go out is if we are going to the toy store to buy hime a toy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband works nights, so we have the days to spend together, and there are many days in a row where we are all here at home. My husband and I want to explore the world with him. New things are tough for him, but we take our time, and do our best to make it fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I take turns going out, but we would love to be able to do more in the outside world as a family. In the house we do many things together and Logan also enjoys playing by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have any of you worked through this with your child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMeryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71513,"nextTopicId":71528}}
