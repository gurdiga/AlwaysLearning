I had a bedpan left over from a hospital visit years ago, and I was putting overnight pads in the bottom (sticking two of them in there) so he could pee in it and I could throw the pads away (in a trashcan on the porch).

I signed her up for some “camps” at Explora, a children’s science museum.  She likes it, but it involves me delivering her and picking her up.  The car’s warning light came on today on the way home—nearly out of gas.  Oops!  Here’s how I get gasoline, when Keith is not in the bed:  “The car needs gas.”<br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s all I need to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has gas now, so I can drive her again tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could tell you ten irritating things about Keith right now.

Things have been up and down since then but we&#39;ve recently had a turning point and for the first time in a long time I felt like I loved my husband again.  Not the man I thought I married or the man I wished him to be but the real man who is here with me every day.  There was a long while when I wondered if it would actually be possible to get those feeling back after everything we&#39;ve been through. We still have a ways to go but we&#39;re growing together again and now I Know we can do it while I had only hoped before.<div><br></div><div>For me the key has been to STOP TALKING to him.  I talk way too much and it shuts him down because all he hears is that he&#39;s messed up and hurt me and can&#39;t do anything right.  Well, surprise surprise, that doesn&#39;t make things better.  But when I stopped talking, not silent treatment, simply not bringing up complaints or problems, he was able to relax and stop acting afraid of me.</div><div><br></div><div>Also very important has been to stop seeing the ways he isn&#39;t living up to my expectations but to see Him instead.  As Sandra says &quot;If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life becomes easier.&quot;  The same thing applies to our spouses.  When I stopped looking at everything he was doing wrong and shifted my focus to everything he was doing right, no matter how small, the mood shifted dramatically.  He can&#39;t let me down if I expect him to be who he is.  We&#39;ve been together more than 10 years now, I know pretty well who he is and what I can expect from him.  That I expected otherwise from him for so long was me refusing to let go of the vision of the husband I wished I had.  Now, instead, I can appreciate the many positive qualities he has and all the things he does to support us.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m very grateful for this group and the incredible advice given here.  Its goal is to discuss Unschooling and Learning but all of the amazing advice to build better relationships with our children can also apply to our spouses if we make the effort.</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1152587134gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1152587134gmail_quote\">On Wed, Aug 2, 2017 at 6:33 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

I know this sounds so harsh but I want to be \nhonest to myself and to this group. I often wish for him to be more \ninterested in unschooling and new ways of living and in relationships. \nTo have a partner with whom I could discuss these topics. Each time I \ntry (and I only try tell him something superficially and not too often) \nhe is more like &quot;Oh, do not think too much about it, you can´t change \nthese things&quot;, &quot;It is how it is, I do not think this is so bad&quot;... Like \nDebbie wrote, I changed because of our son and I also did expect this \nchange to happen to my husband. <br id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79327\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79328\" dir=\"ltr\"><br id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79329\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79330\" dir=\"ltr\">It\n also stresses me a lot when he talks about his problems at work. He has\n a full-time job and we really need his income (which is not so bad). I \noften feel guilty because he apparently has a job he does not really \nlike but he also refuses to look for another job. Sometimes he talks \nabout that but he did not really try. I am not sure how to help&nbsp; him \nbecause I am also afraid to loose his income (on which we depend) if he \nreally would change his job. <br id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79331\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79332\" dir=\"ltr\"><br id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79333\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79334\" dir=\"ltr\">Sarah\n wrote: &quot;Think about the intimacy you share with your child, and how \nsimilar some of it is to that which you shared with your husband.&quot;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79335\" dir=\"ltr\"><br id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79336\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075698619yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501701651039_79337\" dir=\"ltr\">I\n had some similar thought before I wrote here but I do not know how to \nchange that.

And most of what was happening, was happening inside my head. Some things were external, like the way I treated my husband, but it wasn&#39;t awful, just not what I wanted to be. <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I made the decision to go to therapy (by myself) for a while to sort out my thinking with help from another. As this was done, I made a decision to recommit to my marriage. This decision helped (and still helps) me make better choices because once I knew I was staying, I was challenged to take action to make things better between us. The best changes are the small moments, 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there, where I am able to give him my full attention. <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Now that my children are getting older, it is easier to take longer periods of time to get away for a date night, but this is maybe less important than knowing, in each interaction, that my goal is to stay married and make my marriage as

It was tricky.  There were tears, and not just from the babies….  I saw many of my friends&#39; relationships ending through the toddler years, because it IS difficult sometimes.  Its fine to acknowlege that.  But toddlers grow, everything changes, we changed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has brought me really close to my husband as we’ve got older and the children have grown, was something i didn’t see coming and came through the lens of unschooling, and wouldn’t have happened if we had separated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the things that used to frustrate me about my husband turned out to be things I loved about my son.  As my son grew up I learned how to focus on supporting him as a person, partnering him, not trying to make him fit to an expectation of how he SHOULD be, but embracing and celebrating his sensitivity, introversion, the stress he feels in large groups, his lack of inclination to ‘go out and about’ etc.  I now treasure his quick wit, his kindness, his consideration for others, his refusal to ‘tow the line’ if it doesn’t suit him, etc. rather than worrying that, for example, he doesn’t play football and go out much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen…. tada! I realised that these traits that I was supporting and cherishing in my son were the same as some of the ones that annoyed me in my husband!  For example I got annoyed because he didn’t want to ‘go out’, we never went dancing or to festivals.  But I totally accepted that in my son.  Once I saw that he didn’t do these things not because he wasn’t being my perfect husband, but as an expression of his innate personality and had been that way as a boy and probably always would be, I learned to support and cherish him i the same way - how cool to have two of these lovely sensitive men in my life!  It is beautiful seeing them reflected in each other and beautiful to learn to support and cherish them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in summary, unschooling my son helped my relationship with my husband in ways I would never have forseen, and I am so glad to bear witness to them growing together day by day.  It’s very important to take the long view.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383890029,"authorName":"kerry bennassar","from":"kerry bennassar &lt;kerryhorton@...&gt;","profile":"topangacoyote","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Marriage - Falling out of love","postDate":"1501654675","msgId":78189,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSkN4UUF3dUNOd1Jvbj01MGhCUV9DVm09TUpPTUR6QnFuU18wTEFHNnlvZmVOUWU4Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzNTVEM0VELUQxRUUtNDY3Ni1CQTU0LUEyRjlCQjJBNDE2REB5N21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDkzNTVEM0VELUQxRUUtNDY3Ni1CQTU0LUEyRjlCQjJBNDE2REB5N21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78188,"nextInTopic":78190,"prevInTime":78188,"nextInTime":78190,"topicId":78176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Parents, I m just cutting and pasting this for you quickly because I need to go to sleep.

including his unique practice of mindfulness, “hugging meditation.”</h4><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">Beginning Anew is not to ask for forgiveness. Beginning Anew is to change your mind and heart, to transform the ignorance that brought about wrong actions of body, speech, and mind, and to help you cultivate your mind of love. Your shame and guilt will disappear, and you will begin to experience the joy of being alive. All wrongdoings arise in the mind. It is through the mind that wrongdoings can disappear.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">At Plum Village, we practice a ceremony of Beginning Anew every week. Everyone sits in a circle with a vase of fresh flowers in the center, and we follow our breathing as we wait for the facilitator to begin.</p><h5 style=\"color:rgb(160,160,160);font-weight:500;line-height:1.4;margin:32px 0px 32px 45px;font-size:24px;font-style:italic;\">Your shame and guilt will disappear, and you will begin to experience the joy of being alive. All wrongdoings arise in the mind. It is through the mind that wrongdoings can disappear.</h5><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">The ceremony has three parts: flower watering, expressing regrets, and expressing hurts and difficulties. This practice can prevent feelings of hurt from building up over the weeks and helps make the situation safe for everyone in the community.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">We begin with flower watering. When someone is ready to speak, she joins her palms and the others join their palms to show that she has the right to speak. Then she stands, walks slowly to the flower, takes the vase in her hands, and returns to her seat. When she speaks, her words reflect the freshness and beauty of the flower that is in her hand.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">During flower watering, each speaker acknowledges the wholesome, wonderful qualities of the others. It is not flattery; we always speak the truth. Everyone has some strong points that can be seen with awareness. No one can interrupt the person holding the flower. She is allowed as much time as she needs, and everyone else practices deep listening.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">When she is finished speaking, she stands up and slowly returns the vase to the center of the room.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">In the second part of the ceremony, we express regrets for anything we have done to hurt others. It does not take more than one thoughtless phrase to hurt someone. The ceremony of Beginning Anew is an opportunity for us to recall some regret from earlier in the week and undo it.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">In the third part of the ceremony, we express ways in which others have hurt us. Loving speech is crucial. We want to heal the community, not harm it. We speak frankly, but we do not want to be destructive. Listening meditation is an important part of the practice. When we sit among a circle of friends who are all practicing deep listening, our speech becomes more beautiful and more constructive. We never blame or argue.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">Compassionate listening is crucial. We listen with the willingness to relieve the suffering of the other person, not to judge or argue with her. We listen with all our attention. Even if we hear something that is not true, we continue to listen deeply so the other person can express her pain and release the tensions within herself. If we reply to her or correct her, the practice will not bear fruit. We just listen. If we need to tell the other person that her perception was not correct, we can do that a few days later, privately and calmly. Then, at the next Beginning Anew session, she may be the person who rectifies the error and we will not have to say anything. We close the ceremony with a song or by holding hands with everyone in the circle and breathing for a minute. Sometimes we end with hugging meditation.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">Hugging meditation is a practice I invented. In 1966, a woman poet took me to the Atlanta Airport and then asked, “Is it all right to hug a Buddhist monk?” In my country, we are not used to expressing ourselves that way, but I thought, “I am a Zen teacher. It should be no problem for me to do that.” So I said, “Why not?” and she hugged me. But I was quite stiff. While on the plane, I decided that if I wanted to work with friends in the West, I would have to learn the culture of the West, so I invented hugging meditation.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">Hugging meditation is a combination of East and West. According to the practice, you have to really hug the person you are hugging. You have to make him or her very real in your arms, not just for the sake of appearances, patting him on the back to pretend you are there, but breathing consciously and hugging with all your body, spirit, and heart. Hugging meditation is a practice of mindfulness. “Breathing in, I know my dear one is in my arms, alive. Breathing out, she is so precious to me.” If you breathe deeply like that, holding the person you love, the energy of care, love, and mindfulness will penetrate into that person and she will be nourished and bloom like a flower.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">At a retreat for psychotherapists in Colorado, we practiced hugging meditation, and one retreatant, when he returned home to Philadelphia, hugged his wife at the airport in a way he had never hugged her before. To be really there, you only need to breathe mindfully, and suddenly both of you become real. It may be one of the best moments in your life.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\">After the Beginning Anew ceremony, everyone in the community feels light and relieved, even if we have taken only preliminary steps toward healing. We have confidence that, having begun, we can continue. This practice dates to the time of the Buddha, when communities of monks and nuns practiced Beginning Anew on the eve of every full moon and new moon. I hope you will practice Beginning Anew in your own family every week.</p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\"> </p><p style=\"margin:0px 0px 26px;padding:0px;\"><em style=\"\">From Teachings on Love, by Thich Nhat Hanh. © 1998.

Per Sandra s suggestion( and that of so many other wise members), i have been reading a little, waiting a little, trying a little","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-816271499\">This is also my first post. Per Sandra&#39;s suggestion( and that of so many other wise members), i have been reading a little, waiting a little, trying a little and watching. And I have seen my life and that of my family transform into more peaceful and joyful ones. And so i share what is working for me in reference to your post. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that strikes me is your use of the word &quot;should&quot; a couple of times in your description of the situation and how you feel about it. I do realize that english is not your first language but the words we use to speak ( and translate) are often reflective of the words we use to think ( i may be paraphrasing Sandra again).<br/>\n<br/>\n I have found &quot;should&quot; to be a confining word that serves to separate me from joy in the moment and make me feel stuck. &quot;I should ______ ( fill in the blank) and i am not&quot; so therefore I feel guilt shame and frustration with myself. &quot;He should ______( fill in the blank) and he is not&quot; therefore I feel disappointed, deprived, frustrated or even angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found replacing the word &quot;should&quot; with &quot;could&quot; opens doors into possibility and joy. I could respond this way, I could take this action, I could look at it this way. Using the word &quot;could&quot; takes me out of those feelings that dont take me in the direction of where I desire to go ( joy and peace) and puts me solidly into realizing that it all boils down to my choice which is both liberating and empowering and places me solidly in feelings which do take me incrementally closer to that joy and peace which is my ultimate goal in each moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very conducive to and helpful with our unschooling life. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purposes of unschooling working, which is what this site is all about, I have learned that an intact family unit is helpful. This has been life changing when choosing in what way I could view and interact in my relationship with my husband. I have identified my highest clear priority as my daughter, Gaia, and our whole family living, growing and thriving in joy and peace right now and ongoing. In keeping with this, when I come to a choice point ( a point when I am presented with a choice of how to view or respond to whatever has come up in the moment) I hold each possible choice up against this highest clear priority and ask myself &quot;is what I am about to choose to think about, say or do going to take me at least one step closer to the joy and peace today that is my highest clear priority?&quot;. If I cannot see clearly that it will, I choose not to think, say or do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis tool has helped me as I have come to see that what I choose to think about affects how I feel. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look at my husband and choose to notice, think about and therefore focus on any or all of the things he is not doing that I would prefer he did, or if I choose to notice, think about  and focus upon what is not present in our relationship or lives, I might feel sadness or disenchantment ( literally a lack of magic). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I choose to look at my husband like I do our daughter and choose to notice, think about and therefore focus on what is good and beautiful and fun about what he is doing, saying or wearing then I find I feel happy and am able to connect with that magic spark of wonder and discovery (enchantment vs disenchantment). This generates gratitude and my feeling gratitude and seeing things I am grateful for helps me find, see and create more things I am grateful for. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thoughts I choose directly affect the feelings I have. This is not burying my head in the sand in denial of what is but choosing consciously to pay attention to another aspect of things that equally exists. And what we look at influences the direction we go. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever ridden a bike? In my experience, if I see a hole coming up in the road in front of me, a hole I definitely don&#39;t want to end up in, if I keep desperately staring at that hole before I know it my bike is headed right toward that darn hole. But if I choose to chart a path that goes on and to a smooth patch of road I will likely successfully avoid the hole and move forward on smoother ground. It really is this simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n So when I look at my husband I choose to find and see whatever is going on in the moment that is appealing,interesting, beautiful and I find myself loving him more each day. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I write this my husband is sitting on the couch with his legs propped up, watching tv and web surfing. Our house is a mess and my ankle is broken and I am choosing to take care of myself and it by keeping my weight off of it. In previous times I would have habitually engaged in the following types of thoughts : &quot;He should be up washing those dishes. I can&#39;t and so he should. I and our family&#39;s comfort must not be a priority for him&quot;. These are all thoughts that may not even be true, and definitely would not take me in the direction of my highest clear priority and would leave me feeling angry and sad about the state of our relationship and family. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I look at him and choose to notice how content he is, that all members of our family are in the same room having fun and relaxation in each others presence. I choose to be grateful that spending relaxed and peaceful time with his family is his choice rather than obsessing about a sink full of dishes that will still be there tomorrow. When I choose these thoughts I feel love, peace with and gratitude for him and our relationship and family, in the moment, which opens the door to me seeing even more beautiful and special things about him next time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, because I feel better, I find myself speaking with and treating him more sweetly and kindly. And because he was spoken with and treated more kindly he feels better, is better and consistently shows up as someone I choose to love more. Wow! I have come to see as noted in other responses, that the first love that we feel when we initially hook up with someone is real, powerful and seemingly just happens to us. The feelings show up and we take note of their powerful presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, I have found that the love that sustains and nurtures a marriage and family doesn&#39;t just happen. It is something that is created and nurtured. If I have fallen out of love with someone and I would like to be in love with them again (not in the original sexual attraction/excitement way but in the way that is nurturing and sustaining) there is something I personally can do about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn your post you indicated that the problem is in how you feel about your husband and relationship. You did not identify anything he is doing or not doing or how he feels about you and the relationship as a problem. If this is the case, this is good news. It is good news because you cannot control or have ultimate choice of what he says, does or feels. But you do have the power of choice in what you feel, say or do. So this means that you have available to you what may help to create positive change in this situation should you choose to create it. You may find this empowering. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I have also found it helpful in our unschooling family and our relationship to utilize those people close to me as mirrors. When I find something that someone is doing, not doing, saying, not saying, etc that I don&#39;t find appealing or attractive and is hard to look beyond, instead of using it as an opportunity to take their inventory (what else they do or don&#39;t do, say or don&#39;t say, could or should be doing) I endeavor to use it as an opportunity for my own growth and change. How am I being like this right now (could be in reference to this person in particular or someone else, even myself) or how have I been like this in the past?<br/>\n<br/>\n First finding any way I have been like this, objectively and without guilt or shame, gives me the opportunity to have compassion for the other person. This is because if it was easy for me to choose to say or do something that was less than ideal, I can see how it must have been easy for them too. Compassion opens the door to lots of loving possibility and dissolves anger, frustration, resentment. Definitely taking me in the direction I desire to go! <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as I look and see how I am being like that or have been like that in the past (and how it was I wandered into speaking that way or acting that way) I choose to consciously do the opposite at every opportunity. In doing so I am continually improving my relationship with myself and others and am more gentle and caring with those around me. Which means I feel better about myself, they feel better and I am giving them the best opportunity to be the best they can be. <br/>\n<br/>\nThrough engaged unschooling I have come to see that it is more helpful to live and exemplify the characteristics I believe would be helpful to my child so that she sees these actions/ choices/ characteristics as viable options because it is simply what she sees valued and working around her. The same principle is working in my relationship with my husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i treat my husband better and exemplify behaviors and characteristics that are helpful and kind to him and others, he feels better, has energy, motivation and space to make more conscious choices, and often creates more of what is being created around him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this yield? My finding, noticing and focusing on even more reasons to love him.<br/>\n<br/>\n And so it grows. There was a documentary a number of years ago called &quot;I am&quot;. It posed two questions. &quot;What is wrong with the world ?&quot; And also &quot;What is the solution?&quot; For both questions they came up with the same answer. &quot;I am.&quot; Setting aside the premise of the documentary, I find the question and answer helpful and use this as an empowering reminder that so many of the things that make up the quality and breadth of my life really are up to me.

High needs baby/ies and toddlers, feeling totally disconnected from my husband who I had loved for more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1963350222\">This is something I recognise from my own marriage.  High needs baby/ies and toddlers, feeling totally disconnected from my husband who I had loved for more than a decade before we had children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, looking back, I was depressed and shocked after my first very needy baby was born.  She wasn’t what I expected and I adjusted a lot around her and her needs. Plus I was exhausted and sleep deprived for more than two - three years.  Plus my husband also got depressed and felt like I had stopped loving him, I thought he’d stopped loving me, it all spiralled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was three and my youngest was just over one, I started to feel more and more like I wanted to be close again.  I missed that closeness and happiness between us so much, even though we felt so disconnected.  I started asking to talk about it, to tell him I felt so sad and missed us.  it took a little while and quite a few tries, he had kind of shut himself off from me.  But I kept trying, doing little nice things when I could.  For us, just changing behaviour wasn’t enough, we needed to discuss what had gone wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did talk properly about what had happened, why we had become so sad and far apart from each other.  We realised it had been bad for both of us, not just one person angry at the other.  We apologised and acknowledged our parts in it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing how sad my husband had been broke through all the resentment I had built up against him and my feelings for him came flooding back.  I knew they had been there all along, I just couldn’t feel them.  Over time, we have built our relationship back up again, and although things have still been up and down over the 8 years since then, mostly we have been very happy and continue to do better generally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving time together helps, but as attachment parents and now unschoolers we have never done the ‘go away for a week alone’ or even ‘weekly date nights’ that get recommended.  We do have time together every day, but really it’s more about a loving attitude.  And I have acknowledged and accepted that I am the emotional base of the household - if I can remain cheerful and loving and not be too affected by his tendency to pessimism and worry then things are much better for all of us.  It’s unreasonable to expect that to change, it’s been like that since long before we were married and I married him with my eyes open. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the loving gestures and kindnesses extended to my husband help a lot, but for us we needed to clear the air a lot first.  Otherwise it would have been too much like papering over the cracks.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":225155840,"authorName":"","from":"amberuby@...","profile":"amberuby13","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Marriage - Falling out of love","postDate":"1501640387","msgId":78185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG9scmNzMysxamhrYmk5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwMTcwRjdBLUMxNTktNEI5OS05MkVGLTFBQTU5MUFENzBDOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQk5SZUZzaGIwNldWUkR6NU1SdkZtRnB1eVBwdlVFTnZlaGJFb2JMcTRFQTdGN0hXd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDMwMTcwRjdBLUMxNTktNEI5OS05MkVGLTFBQTU5MUFENzBDOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78184,"nextInTopic":78186,"prevInTime":78184,"nextInTime":78186,"topicId":78176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve recently become aware of research by John Gottman.

They seem to mature and change. I don&#39;t know if this is universal to all relationships, but it seems to me that the initial infatuation aspect of love wears off in the first few years and what is left is a deeper sort of relationship, a deeper knowing of the other person.  Connection and appreciation, partnership, and intimacy. Passion and lust and all those fiery aspects of relationships have faded somewhat. They are still there but not the drive of our connection at this stage. I&#39;ve been married for 14 years.  The flip side of this is also less disagreements... They don&#39;t seem so immediate or important, it&#39;s much easier to just let things go. </div><div><br></div><div>Hope this is helpful in some way. </div><div>Shira</div><div dir=\"ltr\">-- <br></div><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">Shira Rocklin</div><div style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">Hypnobabies Childbirth Hypnosis Instructor</div><div style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.radiantbirth.ca/\" style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">www.RadiantBirth.ca</a><br></div><div style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Try the </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hypnobabies-store.com/link.cgi?affiliateID=242\" style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Home-Study Course</a><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">!</span><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Marriage - Falling out of love","postDate":"1501586560","msgId":78182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6d3NfNkRyejBXU29TY0dhNnRGek85bXRzZnh0TW4tRjF3cmJoWENISFhpQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZCRUUwQjdGLTc3QUEtNEZBQS04RUQzLTJFRkM4RDYxMEY2NkBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG9sbzEwcSsxczZ0Njc4QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDZCRUUwQjdGLTc3QUEtNEZBQS04RUQzLTJFRkM4RDYxMEY2NkBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78181,"nextInTopic":78183,"prevInTime":78181,"nextInTime":78183,"topicId":78176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You are not alone in that feeling; I have been listening to/reading some interviews/articles with Esther Perel, who is a couples therapist in NY, and she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1262568125\"><div>You are not alone in that feeling; I have been listening to/reading some interviews/articles with Esther Perel, who is a couples therapist in NY, and she writes about the changes that happen to a relationship when children are born.

Your affection shifts. Think about the intimacy you share with your child, and how similar some of it is to that which you shared with your husband. How do you find romance again? </div><div><br></div><div>Don&#39;t look for it to be like it *was*, make it what it *can be*. Use the principles of unschooling to love what is, as Byron Katie says; turn around your criticisms and frustrations into ways you can work on *yourself* to be a better partner. Every time you feel like *he should* do something, or not do something, give yourself that advice instead. I have found this useful in every relationship, of every nature, that I was unhappy with and that I wanted to be successful in. </div><div><br></div><div>And rekindle. Take baby steps. Do little things. Do things that are different. Have you gotten stuck in a tired routine? Set up a little table with a bottle of wine on the front porch and greet him with it one day. Know that he might not react the way you want at first, but do it for *yourself* with the same joy that you put into making things fresh and new with your child. When the kids were really little, I didn&#39;t put any emphasis on scheduled separate couple time-we made it happen when we could, five minutes, ten minutes to stop and connect in some way. As they get older, it&#39;s easier to get some space when we need it, because they understand and *want* us to be a couple, as well as Mom and Dad. What&#39;s more comforting than knowing your parents love each other? That&#39;s how you can trust that the family unit is intact and protective. </div><div><br></div><div>Esther Perel made a joke about Americans (she&#39;s from Belgium). She said, &quot;Americans love to marry. They do it three, four times.&quot; It&#39;s not about realizing you chose poorly, and that the perfect marriage is to that *other* person. It&#39;s that marriages require work and flexibility, and acknowledgment that they change and flow. You and he aren&#39;t who you were before kids and responsibilities; that&#39;s okay. Open yourself up to finding what you can be as a couple and a family. </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":81257031,"authorName":"Jennifer Moore","from":"Jennifer Moore &lt;jennifer@...&gt;","profile":"jennifer_uncharted_worlds","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Marriage - Falling out of love","postDate":"1501585112","msgId":78181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyMjczMWRlLTA2ODItNmVlMS0wZTc1LWE4NmRkZmVmYWMxZEB1bmNoYXJ0ZWQtd29ybGRzLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG9sbzEwcSsxczZ0Njc4QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG9sbzEwcSsxczZ0Njc4QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78180,"nextInTopic":78182,"prevInTime":78180,"nextInTime":78182,"topicId":78176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi everyone - my first post here, though I ve been reading the list for a while & finding it valuable - thanks everyone! ==== I am really sad for months now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1627659445\">hi everyone - my first post here, though I&#39;ve been reading the list for <br/>\na while & finding it valuable - thanks everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n==== I am really sad for months now because I have the feeling that I <br/>\nhave fallen out of love with my husband.

I learnt so many things about parenting, myself and relationships and I am really grateful for this. But now I recognise more and more, that the feelings toward my husband are not what I like them to be (I know that this somehow sounds strange).

He will likely grow in your kindness.  <br/>\nIf you reject him because he’s not who you want him to be, things will get worse.  If you bring kindness and care to your interactions, things will get better.  You will get stronger, you will be a better parent, you will find more resources of compassion that will nourish you and those around you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis days may not bring him to learn more about people and relationships as yours have done.  Caring for a young child, can lead the caregiver to grow their understandings about people and relationships, and kindness and care.  You grew up with harshness and are now opening up to the wonders of love and care.  You can reach out with kindness to him too.  He’s probably not as readily adorable as a young child, but he was that young child not so long ago.

Divorce with children involved will break your heart over and over and over again.”<br/>\n<br/>\nI willl leave some links, but consider counseling or coaching.  If you can afford to pay for help from unschoolers (if that seems a good angle to you), for this situation I would recommend Roya Dedeaux for you, and Graham Dusseldorp (in Leiden) for your husband (English or Dutch; I don’t know if Graham speaks German).  Maybe even just a couple of sessions, to help you feel warmer and more focused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOr a local marriage counselor.  Don’t let it slide.  You will all be much happier if you fix this sooner than later.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere’s something with a German translation linked.  That’s Graham in the third photo.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/betterpartner\">http://sandradodd.com/betterpartner</a><br/>\nIf something sounds odd in the German, check the original English writing.  <br/>\nI wrote it for the German magazine, and only put the original up after their publication was out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to nag.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nagging\">http://sandradodd.com/nagging</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSay three nice things every day.

But now I recognise more and more, that the feelings\ntoward my husband are not what I like them to be (I know that this somehow\nsounds strange). I really miss the feeling of affection, closeness and (physical)\nattraction. And it really hurts to feel like this. It is not that we have a lot\nof<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>fights or that there is another man /\nwoman. It is „just“ that I am afraid I lost my feelings for him during the last\nthree years. It makes me so sad to feel the deep love and affection when I look\nat our son and to miss these feelings when I look at my own husband. <br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-346516551MsoNormal\"><br></p>\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-346516551MsoNormal\">I know that there are a lot of moments, when I´m not nice to\nmy husband because I am stressed or tired and I am still working on this.
