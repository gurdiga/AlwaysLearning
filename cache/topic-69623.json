Sometimes it helps a lot.  It helps me see the little bits of happiness that are always sprinkled through the low days, and maybe even more importantly, it keeps me from hanging on to the little bits of unhappiness that might be sprinkled through an otherwise pretty great day.  I don&#39;t ignore the difficult moments, because often through them I can learn how to do better next time, but I also don&#39;t give them undue weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling Well","postDate":"1352806747","msgId":69623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1M0EwRjgyLTI5M0ItNDUxNy04QzNBLUUwQ0ZCRjM3Qjg4Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69632,"prevInTime":69622,"nextInTime":69624,"topicId":69623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That other subject line was non-cheery.
