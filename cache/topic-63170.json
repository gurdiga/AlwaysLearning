Fortunately he has no self-consciousness about asking how to spell things, and we just spell them for him without comment. I&#39;m sure that one day he will commit enough words and sounds to memory that even if he doesn&#39;t spell well, he will spell well enough that he can use auto-correct on spellcheck, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nHand the kid a video camera or turn on dragonspeak and he will dictate much more than he would ever want to write or type out. And when he wants to, he dictates and I write or type. And he&#39;s very happy with drawing pictures to remind him of things he wants to remember later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not worried about _how_ he physically expresses his ideas, just that he is able to, some how, when he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Angela in NJ<br/>\nwith Joseph, 9; Hannah, 6; and Miriam, almost 4</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling method (was Re: Writing...)","postDate":"1317333927","msgId":63250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcyQTMyQjgyLUFBMzQtNEI4RC05RkVDLUI5QzI3N0JGRTg0N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo2Mm52dCtvcm5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo2Mm52dCtvcm5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63249,"nextInTopic":63251,"prevInTime":63249,"nextInTime":63251,"topicId":63170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I know there are umbrella schools which have no requirements other than attendance or a list of topics covered for the first few years but then change","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-413433617\">-=- I know there are umbrella schools which have no requirements other than &quot;attendance&quot; or a list of &quot;topics covered&quot; for the first few years but then change when kids are in the tweens or teen years. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUmbrella schools are usually homeschooling organizations, or an individual willing to file paperwork (if required) and take care of testing and test scores (if required).

Not only is what I write useful to people who don&#39;t even need to admit they read it, but each question asked gets more than one answer, so there are dimensions to the responses, depth, and angles.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Writing&quot; is so broad a field of ideas that my head spins just trying to summarize it, and I&#39;ve taught &quot;writing&quot; before.  And I have three children who have gone from not writing to writing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s work involves real-time written exchanges (something that was never even dreamt of when I was in school), as he&#39;s (now supervisory, but once front-lines) working with the in-game interface in World of Warcraft, where the players can ask questions or appeal to the company (in the form of game masters).  That&#39;s done by typing answers, right then and there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in school, typing had to do with transcribing words from paper to other paper with a typewriter.  Later word processing came along, but that was also just moving someone else&#39;s words into a more editable and useable format.  Nowhere in there was anyone thinking it would become instant back-and-forth communication.  We use it her on this discussion list, though a little slower (and we can take time to edit, though twice yesterday I posted things without stopping to think--one on facebook and one an announcement of my Wednesday online chats <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/room\">http://sandradodd.com/room</a> ).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and her boyfriend text, and though sometimes I can&#39;t believe they don&#39;t just call and talk real words, they have a record of their exchanges, and they can leave messages without interrupting the other&#39;s activities.  When Holly finishes a yoga class or a babysitting job, she has a message from Will.  She can leave him a message he can check after he finishes working on tile (he&#39;s doing murals for a city project) or recording (his band is doing a CD).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and his friends are in constant contact through facebook, texts, and XBox.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of those involve writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to look at this is the &quot;language arts&quot; angle: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/language/\">http://sandradodd.com/language/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/etymology\">http://sandradodd.com/etymology</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying with words gives kids advantages.  I don&#39;t want to say &quot;vocabulary enrichment,&quot; because that sounds ponderous (and it IS ponderous), but word play and the freedom and joy to rearrange words without criticism will move a person nearer to good writing than any &quot;practice&quot; sheets/drills/sessions ever could.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Writing...","postDate":"1317218587","msgId":63194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1djllcitoZ3AzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1dTRmbCsydnNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63185,"nextInTopic":63196,"prevInTime":63193,"nextInTime":63195,"topicId":63170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to everyone!

Because there are only three or four places where such reporting is required, when it&#39;s discussed on an international list, it ends up spooking new unschoolers from the 70 (or howevermany) other jurisdictions and this discussion isn&#39;t supposed to be about laws anyway, but how learning works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traditions of written homework go back to times when clerks hand-wrote people&#39;s banking receipts and ledgers, when all business correspondence was done with pen and ink, and when every bit of writing was either set by a linotype machine operator or was done by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose days are long gone. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that you type letters when you write to your parents, rather than hand write them all, but even if you don&#39;t, consider that many young people--even who went to school--can&#39;t read cursive writing, and especially the cursive writing of much older people than they are.  Styles change, and individuals&#39; handwriting goes downhill as they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing to do about handwriting is not to worry about it.

Neither of them went very far in school.  I was the first person in my family to go on in school, and it was one of the highlights of their lives. (Not so much for me, but I did get a lot out of it at the same time.)  Whenever we see them, they ask about &quot;the three Rs.&quot;  My dad, especially, looks very concerned when he asks.  So far, he has been happy enough with our responses, although, as our son gets older, I know him well enough to know that he will test and ask difficult questions at some point.  Then, he will look generally disappointed if the results are not what he is expecting.  He can be very hard.  We only see them once or twice a year, however.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same is similar with my husband&#39;s family, although they are less likely to ask questions when my husband and I are around (which makes me nervous for my son).   <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our friends are either conventional homeschoolers or go to school.  Being that they are around the same age as our son, a big part of their homework and days is writing.  Parents have talked with me about their frustrations around getting their kids to do their writing.  I don&#39;t say much.  I just nod and listen.  But, I have to admit, I allow it to worry me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the state district that I need to report to.  We live in the state of New York with quarterly reports and testing that starts next year.  This is also playing on my mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my problem is that I am focusing on what we are *not* doing, and forgetting all of the cool things we *are* doing.  Because of that I kind of panic inside when listening to others, get asked questions or think about future interactions, reports or tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has a wonderful vocabulary, and tells brilliant stories.  He has great understanding of what he reads, especially game manuals.  If I said he likes to read game manuals or Garfield, or wikipedia to family, friends, or the state, they would likely sigh and/or express concern.  So, I just say he reads all the time, which he does.  I could do the same with writing if I could look at it differently.  I need to work on that.  I was hoping writing games would introduce writing in a fun way, but, as I type this, it sounds to me like I am doing it for the wrong reasons.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276080282,"authorName":"delphini004","from":"&quot;delphini004&quot; &lt;delphini004@...&gt;","profile":"delphini004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Writing...","postDate":"1317134433","msgId":63175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1c245MStsZ2ZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1cmNtYSs2ZWRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63174,"nextInTopic":63176,"prevInTime":63174,"nextInTime":63176,"topicId":63170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a son (19) who writes a lot, now rather to the keyboard.

Often she would write a couple sentences on a page and then illustrate the following page until she had what she thought was enough for a book.  She would then staple the pages together on the edge.  She decided when she was 8 that she wanted to try school.  I signed her up on a waiting list for a small, progressive school for the following school year.  When she began that year, 4th grade, she was enthusiastic about writing.  But after a couple months of being told what to write, how much and harshly critiqued, her love of writing was crushed.  She left school after 4 months and didn&#39;t write anything the rest of the year.  Last year she became very interested in anime and manga.  She reads and watches them voraciously.  A friend told her about fan fiction related to some of her favorite shows and she started writing again.  Sometimes she writes collaboratively with other people but most often she writes a couple hours a day on one of a few stories she&#39;s working on.  When she needs a better word she asks for suggestions.  When she can&#39;t spell something she asks or Googles it.  She has her stories critiqued by other writers on a fan fiction website.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old son only writes wish lists.  He is not as creatively inclined and sees writing only as a tool to help us know what to buy him when we can.  My eldest son, 18, was not unschooled but traditionally homeschooled.  He was made to practice penmanship daily and write essays.  Today he still has poor handwriting and never writes unless absolutely necessary.  Different people write for different reasons.

My son is eight, and really has no interest in writing on paper.  He reads well, and types words for his games on the computer, but doesn&#39;t like writing anything on paper.  He used to write all the time.  Letters, numbers, love notes, cards, comics...that kind of thing.  Now, not at all.  I&#39;m wondering if I should be doing more.  My husband and I both write often--notes, lists, etc.  Are there fun games that have a writing component to them?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if it comes up with family and friends what would be a good response.  I&#39;m a bit afraid of that part.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63265,"nextTopicId":63201}}
