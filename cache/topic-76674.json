If there’s no such law where you are, no problem.  In a few places where tests are required, if the score is very low the parents might have a year to “catch up” or they might be supervised or something.  Laws change, and I can’t say where that might be true now, but that (I think) was the intent of the question.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKnow your local laws.

I am grateful I have read enough on here and elsewhere over the last 2 years to at least get the bigger picture of how this choice fits in with unschooling. I &nbsp;just wanted confirmation I suppose.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I have explained to her how much work it will mean, that we will be required to send in samples every 3 weeks and she will have a teacher. I think she is possibly excited by the accountability part in fact. She likes to sleep in so she&#39;s already decided that she will do her school work in the afternoon before dance/guides which this year fall quite late in the day. It will be an interesting experience. She will need help because we obviously have not been ticking curriculum standard boxes the last few years and no I am not in the least concerned about grades nor will it be an issue to stop when she&#39;s had enough as I can pay term by term. It is a different empowered approach compared with how I used to try and do homeschool before we began unschooling when I felt compelled to tick the boxes. I think it could be frustrating when we come across the plethora of schooly work that seems uninteresting or a waste of time. Maybe I need to open my mind up more amd let her decide those things.</div><div><br></div><div>I did get pams intro when I first joined here in late 2013 but I really should read it again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"font-size:9px;color:#575757;\">Sent from my Samsung GALAXY Note3 on the Telstra Mobile network</div></div></div><br><br><div>-------- Original message --------</div><div>From: &quot;Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

I think it&#39;s to fit in or to make sure she&#39;s covered in case she&#39;s tested and she is also aware that if she wants to be a vet (if she&#39;s not a professional ballerina) she needs to cover maths etc. at university. I asked her if she would like to go to school but she definitely does not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I am going to have to push her everyday to complete the book work in this program which his against all the unschooling principles I have been working on these last two years (prior to that we did a smattering or curriculum, a bit if which - a handwriting book - which she dragged out of one of the many cardboard boxes lying about last night and got to work). <br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested we just do mathusee or some other type of schooly thing by ourselves if she wants to experience what school is.
