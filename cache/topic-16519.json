We forget that DNA works for us, too<br/>\n;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, on the same day, I read two articles in the same newspaper. <br/>\nDifferent pages. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first said that extensive research shows that golden retrievers&#39; <br/>\npersonalities are basically genetic. That aggressive begets aggressive and submissive <br/>\nbegets submissive. That environmental differences can cause inherent <br/>\naggressiveness to be less or more severe, etc., etc., same with with submissive. Best <br/>\nnot to breed two aggressive golden retrievers to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second article said that maybe there was a possibility that possibly it <br/>\ncould be that maybe in some ways the probability exists that humans *might* be <br/>\nproned to possible genetic influences that, well,  there seems to be a trend <br/>\nthat might point to the possibility that, genetically, people who are <br/>\nimprisoned for assault may contribute to the probability that their children may, but <br/>\nit isn&#39;t conclusive, that the children of these prisoners are maybe more apt to <br/>\nbecome---but that the evidence certainly isn&#39;t conclusive---but that the <br/>\npossibility exists that those children might, under the right circumstances, <br/>\nbecome prisoners too. Maybe. For assault. Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe humans have a hard time seeing ourselves as animals! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16514,"nextTopicId":16492}}
