I think <br/>\nnot. I think each unschooling family should exist in the real world, <br/>\nwhole and independent.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this assessment.  Our family has lived with other families.  When it&#39;s hard enough for partners to stay together, it&#39;s even harder to make it work within a context of multiple others.  Both times that we lived with other families it worked just fine.  The longest we stayed with another family was a year.  There were problems that arose, things we had to work through, but overall the experience was a good one.  It didn&#39;t destroy any lasting friendships either, but that took a lot of work afterward to keep up with those friendships after a bit of time and space.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents also lived communally for a while when I was young.  It was great as a kid, but my parent&#39;s experience was very different from what I experienced.  If anyone has seen the movie, the Anarchists Cookbook, it has a lot of very interesting eye opening thoughts about communal living and the dynamics that happen within a communal setting.  That&#39;s not to say that all communes experience what happens in that story, but from having done a bit of communal living myself, and having talked extensively with my own parents about it, this outcome is more likely than not, albeit, maybe not as extreme.  There have been relatively successful communes over the history of communes.  Theirs was a hippy experience, which in many ways wasn&#39;t the best communal experience, nor really indicative of communal experiences in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the basic problem that I have with communes, in relation to unschooling;  Unschooling operates as a family unit where the parents give their children many choices, as many as they can, in order that they&#39;ll be able to grow up knowing themselves better, learning more, and being more solidly able to make good choices for themselves as adults.  All communes operate within a defined parameter that helps the commune work most effectively.  Those parameters narrow the choices that a parent can give their children.  I&#39;ve experienced this even on a smaller level of living with just one other family.  Some of those choices may be a favorable trade off for something better, like a bigger and nicer house and the ability to save money that one can use for their children.  Eventually that trade off may not be so great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe notion of communes is appealing, I&#39;ll agree wholeheartedly with that!  The actual practice of it, isn&#39;t nearly as great as the idea of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: No friends","postDate":"1257606439","msgId":48478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5MzMwMDNBLTNBMUItNDQ2MC05MEZCLTJEMUU0MDFGMjI0MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhkM2E3cCtyaDlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhkM2E3cCtyaDlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48477,"nextInTopic":48480,"prevInTime":48477,"nextInTime":48479,"topicId":48446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-And I m not saying you didn t give it a chance--I m just asking.

But these natural hook ups take opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had people visit our group before and expect their children to jump right in, and for the children that know each other to be immediately open to them, and sometimes it happens, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t.

It&#39;s really no different than how I feel meeting a new person, but I have a little more practice in trying to find common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not saying you didn&#39;t give it a chance--I&#39;m just asking.

My nearby niece and nephew grew up with only each other for friends, yet are now lively 20-somethings with many friends and interests, and seemingly healthy connections with people of all ages.  They learned how to be around other teenagers when my sister would go with them to concerts as they grew old enough and were interested, and when they got jobs at the local deli which mainly hired young people.  It was pretty amazing how smoothly they flowed out into the world when they were ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids seem to want more friends, they may not need &quot;same age&quot; kids - we posted a sign asking for fellow Yi-Gi-Oh players when we moved to a rural area and my son wanted someone to play with. One boy, younger than we had hoped for, responded.  The two boys did become good friends, and his mom and I recruited other local families (multi-age, home-schooled and not) for activities that seemed fun to our kids.  That informal group is now 5 years old and going strong - maybe you can start something that works for you and your kids, rather than joining a group that doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nThea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J&quot; &lt;jmarsh122@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My ds and dd are 12 yo.

I&#39;m 33, but I&#39;m one of those weirdos that&#39;s been on the Internet since the early 90s *g*  so a lot of my friends in &quot;3D&quot; are people I first met online. And I first did that in the era of ubiquitous scare tactics about meeting people from online - everyone was a potential ax murderer!!! (no one ever actually was, of course) - but nowadays it&#39;s totally commonplace. Even online dating has lost a lot of its stigma - even for teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very social, but an only child, and desires more friends, so I&#39;m encouraging him to try to talk to people with whom he has a shared interest online. You have to be mindful that some (many) social networks and forums don&#39;t allow kids under 13. Some parents put a false birthday in the birthdate field for their kids&#39; profiles, but that&#39;s up to you. My son really enjoys Skyping with friends and relatives all over the world, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could try Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LiveMocha.com is a fun one if there is an interest in languages, Ning.com has a million mini-social networks catering to a lot of different shared interests, there are countless message forums, etc. (LOTS of forums about Yugioh!) With the Internet, it&#39;s not *necessary* to be isolated anymore, even for missionaries and aborigines. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea in Miami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] No friends","postDate":"1257439792","msgId":48447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxODgzQjI3LTMzNDYtNEYwQS05Qjk2LTE0MTdBNTJCMDFDRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjdXAwaCtvMXNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhjdXAwaCtvMXNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48446,"nextInTopic":48450,"prevInTime":48446,"nextInTime":48448,"topicId":48446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m worried about the future -- a childhood without friends.
