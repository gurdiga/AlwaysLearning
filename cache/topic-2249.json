I have my kids disbuded around 10 days of<br/>\nage or so.. as soon as the horn bud is poking through the hair.. horns<br/>\naren&#39;t allowed around here at all! Dangerous to me.. and to other goats and<br/>\na real problem with getting stuck in fences too.<br/>\nI&#39;ve also raised Rabbits..mostly the Angora type for fiber..I have a flock<br/>\nof Rhode Island Red chickens and Japanese Silkie bantams ..plus my daughters<br/>\ntwo Appaloosa horses and my 3 Sheep and 4 Nubies.. we only have a couple of<br/>\nacres too.. so our hay bill is pretty high in the winter months.<br/>\nIf you want to &#39;talk goat&#39; feel free to email me private anytime.. since all<br/>\nthis farm stuff might be boring for everyone else.<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dairy Goats","postDate":"1010372263","msgId":2249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDUwMWMxOTcyNyQxYzUyZWQ0MCRmMWE3YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTAzNjcwODkuMjcxLjU0NTYwLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2294,"prevInTime":2248,"nextInTime":2250,"topicId":2249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Julie, We are just getting started with dairy goats.
