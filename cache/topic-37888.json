He got a hot dog, and we sat down to eat.  The bun was<br/>\nfalling apart, and he was getting upset.  I tried to use the pieces of bun<br/>\narranged on different pieces of hot dog to give him what I thought he<br/>\nwanted.a nice looking piece of meat inside of 2 pieces of bun.  But he kept<br/>\ngetting more upset.  &quot;I no like that!&quot;  In the past, I would have probably<br/>\ngotten short with him.  But as this went on, and I tried in vain to arrange<br/>\nthe pieces of hot dog and bun (falling apart) in yet another arrangement, I<br/>\njust kept trying to plug into him more, and kept smiling, staying calm.<br/>\nFinally he said, &quot;I want more ketchup!&quot;  He had been mutilating the hot dog<br/>\njust trying to find the bits of bun that had the most ketchup on them.  So I<br/>\njust grabbed a bottle of ketchup and squirted a large blog on the side of<br/>\nhis plate, and he was in dunking heaven, and we went back to having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, his mama was already in bed, and he and I were watching<br/>\nSpongebob on tv.  As we were turning it off to go to bed, headed down the<br/>\nhall, he said, &quot;wait!&quot;, and went back in the kitchen, and I followed.  He<br/>\npicked up a leftover piece of pancake on the counter and said, &quot;I want<br/>\nthis&quot;.  I thought he meant he wanted to take it to bed, but I wasn&#39;t sure.<br/>\nSometimes he likes to eat something just before bed (not *in* bed), but I<br/>\nwas really tired.  But instead of starting into a list of reasons why I&#39;d<br/>\nprefer him not to take crumbly food to a dark bed at 11pm with mommy already<br/>\nasleep in it, or trying to push some food on him quickly so I could get to<br/>\nbed quicker, I just kept listening to what was going on.  Finally I<br/>\nunderstood that he did not want to leave the food (about 4 tablespoons worth<br/>\nof pancake) out on the counter, and wanted it in the fridge.  No problem!  I<br/>\ngot a paper towel and wrapped the pancake, and he put it in the fridge and<br/>\nwe went to bed happy.  This is the first time he&#39;s ever taken action to<br/>\npreserve food, and I&#39;m glad I was open to it, instead of arguing with him<br/>\nabout what I *thought* he wanted. And this morning he went straight to the<br/>\nfridge when he got up, and brought me the paper-towel-wrapped pancake to<br/>\nheat up for him.  And he told me again, &quot;See, I want this!  Me no leave<br/>\nout.&quot;  He&#39;s always just watched us put things away, but the pancake was<br/>\nimportant enough to him to want to put it away himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been really concentrating on being Present with him the past few weeks,<br/>\nnot making assumptions about what he &quot;usually&quot; wants in any given situation,<br/>\nand I&#39;m feeling more connected with him than I have in several months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37884,"nextTopicId":37401}}
