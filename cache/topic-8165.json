And I<br/>\nlearned myself.  When I was in the 5th grade my m&d said no more<br/>\ntherapy, i would do it when it was important, and I did.  Unless I&#39;m<br/>\ndrunk or on benadryl or muscle relaxing drugs or when I smoked pot (in<br/>\nhigh school) I can usually say my &quot;r&#39;s and &quot;l&#39;s&quot; now.  Not that I get<br/>\ndrunk often these days and I haven&#39;t smoked pot in years, but I still<br/>\nhave to take care to say certain words correctly.  I believe it was the<br/>\nword &quot;purse&quot; that finally made me a. work hard to say my &quot;r&#39;s&quot;correctly<br/>\nand b. made me NEVER  use that word.  Even today I generally say<br/>\nanything else.  Just imagine a middle school girl asking a bunch of her<br/>\nmean spirited peers to hand &quot;me my purse&quot; with out the &quot;r&quot; and you&#39;ll<br/>\nsee why.  But anyway, while I can say my r&#39;s now, I cannot nor do I even<br/>\nattempt to roll them.  To me it&#39;s enough that I can say purse without<br/>\nraised eyebrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  And my question is... why does one need to roll their &quot;r&#39;s&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never learned to do it.
