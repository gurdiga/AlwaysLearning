We&#39;ve watched lots of videos about insects, looked at pictures in books and on the internet, dug in our garden in search of cool insects.  He&#39;s also been interested in what words mean and where they come from.<br/>\n<br/>\nLate last night, when lots of connections seem to be made around here, Logan asked me where the word &quot;ladybug&quot; came from.  Wikipedia:  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***The name &quot;ladybird&quot; originated in Britain where the insects became known as &quot;Our Lady&#39;s bird&quot; or the &quot;Lady beetle&quot;. Mary (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings and the spots of the seven spot ladybird (the most common in Europe) were said to symbolise her seven joys and seven sorrows. In the United States the name was adapted to &quot;ladybug&quot;.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo from insects we went to talking about Mary and Jesus (who he&#39;s heard referred to on the BBC &quot;Life&quot; series with the Jesus Christ Lizard) and why Mary had some happy things (seven joys) and sad things (seven sorrows) happen during her life.
