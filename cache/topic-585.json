And they can be just as casual and unthinking about it as many of us were in our old &quot;love-in&quot; days.pam......... <br/>\n<br/>\nSex is bigger than ever, no doubt about it!! All you have to do is look at the popular fashions, the neck lines are more than plunging and lycra doesn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. Girls in their early 20&#39;s having botox treatments, breast augmentations and liposuction etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\nShow me a 10 year old who doesn&#39;t know about sex. Brittany Spears makes Barbie look like a puritan! The images that these kids have in their heads from all of the available media is astounding and incomprehensible to anyone raised in the 60&#39;s. As the &#39;cool&#39; mom of a &#39;with it&#39; teen I&#39;ve found that the generation gap is an unavoidable abyss, my kids are on the other side and that&#39;s just the way it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat 17yo boy can say no to being seduced by a 17yo gorgeous  (what 17yo girl isn&#39;t gorgeous) girl. Hormones, instinct, overwhelming physical response to stimuli, natural human behavior, I don&#39;t know the answer short of overwhelming religious indoctrination,  fear of hell.......  <br/>\nPersonally I believe the only way to handle it is give them all of the facts about birth control and disease control and provide them with what they realistically need. Crossing your fingers, closing your eyes or just telling them it&#39;s bad, doesn&#39;t do a dam bit of good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t raise kids without imposed rules and boundaries and then expect to lay down the law when they you get scared. No curfew might mean late night walks or all night dance parties. If we don&#39;t want to tolerate state imposed education why would we use state imposed curfews to do the dirty work for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nControl is the issue here and even though we might want to believe we aren&#39;t controlling our young ones, we soon become aware of what control really is, when they become teens/adults. We all learn the greatest lessons by making mistakes and there is no time when this fact is more evident than during the teen years. I can tell you from experience that watching your kids make mistakes is a lot harder that making them yourself. I&#39;ve been riding the teen mom roller coaster for 6 years now and I&#39;ve been way up and way down! Now that the ride with my oldest seems to be leveling out Number 2 just turned 12 and he&#39;s going to his friends 14th b-day party this evening, am I worried? I just hope he&#39;s learned some lessons from his big brother!!!  As much as I want to be there for him, be his best friend etc.. I can feel him pulling away, holding some stuff back, becoming a man. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure my now 7yo dd will be the end of me! I knew the moment I saw her that her vulnerability was overwhelming for me. Until then I maintained that there was no difference between sons and daughters. I nursed them all until they were 5, the two younger ones are still in our bed, but they grow up up and away and there really is no holding them back :~(<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie, dutifully providing the necessities of life, their life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teenage issues","postDate":"1008271809","msgId":632,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yi41YzQyNTE5LjI5NGE1YmMxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":631,"nextInTopic":689,"prevInTime":631,"nextInTime":633,"topicId":585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/13/2001 10:28:54 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...

My 14 year old looks <br/>\nabout 17, and we&#39;ve already had some girls following him around and <br/>\ncalling.  At this point he still seems to be at that yes and no stage about <br/>\ngirls.

He&#39;s even less of a <br/>\ntalker-about-feelings than his dad.)  The one time I heard that he *had* <br/>\nmet up with a girl at the ball park and spent some time with her that day, <br/>\nit seemed all the calls stopped right after.  So he may have been turned <br/>\noff by female agression, or simply indicated he wasn&#39;t ready for the mooshy <br/>\nmooshy stuff.  I&#39;ll probably never know.

So I tell my boys I <br/>\ndo NOT want to risk being in trouble and they have to stay inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night a few years back, my husband got up, saw that there were boys (then <br/>\n10, 12) awake and told them &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to the park?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe park is three blocks away.  It&#39;s not by a main street.  It&#39;s surrounded <br/>\nby residences.  There is an 11:00 or so curfew on park use.  My husband is <br/>\nupon occasion not thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys thought it was great. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was horrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would tell the night-cruising boy that no, one of the costs of <br/>\nhomeschooling is to keep schoolkids&#39; schedules, to some extent.  I might <br/>\nprobably also put the fear of rape and murder into him (lightly...) and tell <br/>\nhim that although most perverts prefer girls, there are a few....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are on the other end of the sleepover issue.  They&#39;ve had overnight <br/>\nvisits since they were little, and kids from the babysitting co-op, and <br/>\nneighbors, and many times they were girls.  There was no good time to say <br/>\n&quot;Now you&#39;re all too old for this.&quot;  Occasionally after a late night of D&D or <br/>\nAnime club there will be a girl among the regular boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it would have caused heart-attacks in guys my dad&#39;s age, I figure <br/>\nthe danger is when a teenaged girl is overnighting with a single teenaged <br/>\nboy, but if it&#39;s one girl and three or four boys, she&#39;s totally safe.    Dumb <br/>\nas it sounds on the outside, it makes sense with this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a related story to tell.  (Susan&#39;s daughter Kira and I discussed this <br/>\nlast week, so you might hear it twice, Susan.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a house with four girls.  Four teenaged girls all at once.  I <br/>\nwas well aware of all angles and facets of the behaviors of bad boys, and <br/>\nwhat girls needed to be aware of and careful about, and how evil boys could <br/>\nbe to girls and how it was a girl&#39;s responsibility, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have boys.  Now I have seen (felt, really) some fears that had never <br/>\noccurred to me in my whole life until I saw  my boys in the presence of some <br/>\ngirls I didn&#39;t trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I worry about girls who would do just about anything to assert their <br/>\nindependence from their dads, and if it involved getting knocked up by the <br/>\nfirst guy dumb enough to do her, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate.  And I&#39;ve seen the <br/>\ncompetition between girls for Kirby&#39;s attentions, and I worry about the <br/>\nescalating offers of favors if he continues to be his suave, attractive self. <br/>\n (I don&#39;t personally see it--he seems oafish and irritating to me, his mom, <br/>\nbut even Kira who&#39;s 21 discussed the Kirby-draw.)  I hope the bidding wars <br/>\nare never necessary, nor if they start he doesn&#39;t go there.  All his <br/>\ngirlfriends have been older than he is, and they all (four or five of them, <br/>\ndepending on whether we count the one long camping weekend deal) initiated <br/>\nthe social relationship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll his friends up to 18, are still virgins.  Even the girls.  He hangs out <br/>\nwith some older folk, and early-20&#39;s, and college crowd, who fool around (or <br/>\nwould be willing if opportunity presented--they&#39;re gaming geeks for the most <br/>\npart), but they&#39;re not in his range of option yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made it to 17.  My sister made 14.  The cousins in my house...  14 and 15.<br/>\nWas it school?  Was it the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s and the atmosphere of <br/>\nsex/drugs/rock&#39;n&#39;roll?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve named two girls for my guys to remain clothed at all times with.  I see <br/>\nin their eyes--one I&#39;ve seen in action with her (single-parent) dad; the <br/>\nother has only a mom with a string of sleepover boyfriends.  Those girls need <br/>\nan exit pass.  And they&#39;re both mean in the glance, and mean in the voice.   <br/>\nI told the boys (and two of their homeschooling friends) that if a girl gets <br/>\npregnant they have no option.  Their choice is to be a good dad or a bad dad. <br/>\n And it won&#39;t be within their control even what their opportunities to do <br/>\nthat are, but they will end up being responsible or irresponsible, and living <br/>\nwith the girl for a long time, or living with the guilt for life.  But that <br/>\none moment can be the end of all their future options.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side of that whole coin looks very different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now Holly is ten.  Kirby told her last week he doesn&#39;t want her coming to <br/>\nActive Imagination if she doesn&#39;t have to.  (That&#39;s their gaming-shop hangout <br/>\nand Kirby&#39;s place of employment.   She rarely goes--usually just to deliver <br/>\nlunch or pick someone up.)  Why?  What was her sin?

I¹m glad most of this stuff is behind me (my girls are 19 and<br/>\n21), although now it&#39;s more my having to sit by and watch them go through<br/>\nthings that I can&#39;t help with, other than to just be a listening ear.<br/>\n  <br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":934,"nextTopicId":1487}}
