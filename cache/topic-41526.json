It was friday morning after a long week of babysitting and a<br/>\nrare free morning for us. Because our schedule is often dictated by<br/>\nwho I am babysitting I felt more freedom. There are 3 music classes<br/>\neach spaced an hour apart. We can go to any of them. She was having a<br/>\ngreat time playing at home and I was putzing.

I mentioned it a couple times and<br/>\nreminded her of all the fun things that we do there.

I saw some designed for small<br/>\nchildren that were between 100 and 150, I think.  The screen was<br/>\nsmall, but they were supposed to be pretty sturdy.  Perhaps she would<br/>\nbe more amenable to transitioning to the handheld at the end of the<br/>\nepisode.  You could go to the park or take a walk and she could sit<br/>\ndown and watch her show if she wanted to or run around and play if she<br/>\nwanted to do that.  We live in a rural area and so I play tv in the<br/>\ncar for the kids when we have a long ride ahead of us.  It makes<br/>\ntransitions out of the house easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, it might help to select one episode instead of play all... it just<br/>\nwraps around and plays over and over again.  Be available to start the<br/>\nnext one, of course, without any negativity about watching another<br/>\nepisode.  If it stops, it is easier to have a minute break to talk<br/>\nabout what would be most fun to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have them already, there are Dora duplo sets and there is<br/>\na Dora dollhouse.

Might be fun to play with the dollhouse or build<br/>\nthings during the episodes too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a small trampoline and legos near the TV and a whole bunch of<br/>\ntoys nearby, but not right right next to the TV.   We rearrange things<br/>\ndepending on what is interested and there are several areas with fun<br/>\nthings (toys, art table, etc.) where they can see the TV and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe downloaded some dora video games from bigfishgames.  They had a 1<br/>\nhour trial so you can try them first to see if she can play them (or<br/>\nenjoys playing with you).

I have a couple of<br/>\n&gt; concerns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My first concern is that maybe I am not doing enough other things to<br/>\n&gt; engage her. I realize that this is not a question that you can answer<br/>\n&gt; since you do not know our daily life and how we interact. I guess I am<br/>\n&gt; more wondering if she is happy and I talk on the phone for half an<br/>\n&gt; hour, is that ok? (I&#39;m thinking of Sandra&#39;s chart and how much time<br/>\n&gt; you spend with your child based on age) Or cleaning up... or anything<br/>\n&gt; else. I often watch with her and know all the story lines, and can<br/>\n&gt; talk with her about it etc. I am also very aware of making sure to get<br/>\n&gt; her food, make sure she&#39;s comfortable etc. But she is only 2 1/2 -- I<br/>\n&gt; guess I think if I were trying harder to do more different things she<br/>\n&gt; might watch less. But then I get in an argument with myself -- is less<br/>\n&gt; better? This seems to be what she really wants right now. Today I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to go outside and play in the snow and she really insisted that<br/>\n&gt; she wanted to stay and watch Dora. I tried convincing her for about an<br/>\n&gt; hour. Then I feel bad because I don&#39;t want her to think that I am not<br/>\n&gt; listening to her (we didn&#39;t end up going out). However, she often<br/>\n&gt; changes her mind after saying no several times, and I know she would<br/>\n&gt; have had fun outside. It was a rare free morning for us and I wanted<br/>\n&gt; to respect her wish to stay in as much as I wanted to go out. But when<br/>\n&gt; do you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>\n&gt; and we will do more of what you want later?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry this is long and convoluted. I had a really long<br/>\n&gt; philosophical conversation with my mom about parenting. I am very<br/>\n&gt; lucky to have an open minded and supportive mother, but I know she<br/>\n&gt; even struggles with all these ideas I have. I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>\n&gt; straightening this out in my mind, it seems like there are too many<br/>\n&gt; considerations. But I think to answer my own question, I have to keep<br/>\n&gt; our relationship first in my mind (my daughter&#39;s and mine) and I<br/>\n&gt; always think that if I am feeling guilty than maybe that means I<br/>\n&gt; should be offering (strewing) more (or more involved). Any input would<br/>\n&gt; be greatly appreciated! I really feel like with kids, even really<br/>\n&gt; little ones, most people in our society thinks, they need to learn<br/>\n&gt; that they don&#39;t always get their way, or to entertain themselves, or<br/>\n&gt; many other things... So I still have many voices in my head that I are<br/>\n&gt; in disagreement with each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan May<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335633701,"authorName":"DaBreeze21","from":"&quot;DaBreeze21&quot; &lt;susanmay15@...&gt;","profile":"DaBreeze21","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: 2 1/2 yo in love with Dora","postDate":"1233334353","msgId":41612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsdmI4aCtnZzVxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0OTY4MDZDLTMwQTAtNEY5NC04QzRCLUZBNjE1NEUxMjgwNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41600,"nextInTopic":41617,"prevInTime":41611,"nextInTime":41613,"topicId":41526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We have stuffed Max and Ruby too. She liked <br/>\nDora, and we have a bunch of the dolls, but it was not the same adoration as <br/>\nMax and Ruby. Now she&#39;s 9. She doesn&#39;t care about Max and Ruby at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover she will also, now, happily leave a recording of any of her current <br/>\nfavorite to play, and know that she can come back to it later.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it is experience - knowing that she really will have the opportunity <br/>\nto watch again later, regardless of how often she has watched an episode.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it is maturity - she has a much clearer understanding of time, and <br/>\ntime passing now. &quot;Later&quot; doesn&#39;t feel like forever to her any more. She is <br/>\nmore willing to allow me something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were you I would find something to do near her and continue to invite <br/>\nher outside or elsewhere when the episode is over. I might even go on <br/>\noutside and play in the snow and enjoy it - even if she didn&#39;t come out <br/>\nuntil her show was over.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But when<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>\n&gt; and we will do more of what you want later?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me the answer to that is &quot;when it is genuinely essential&quot;. The store <br/>\nwill absolutely be closed, this is when my doctor&#39;s appointment is, the <br/>\nplane leaves at this time. If the consequences would impact Jayn negatively <br/>\nI tell her that too. I don&#39;t think missing playing in the snow really fits <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has become much more patient and tolerant of my activities with <br/>\nmaturity also. And yes, I love it when she is happy to watch tv for a whole <br/>\nhalf hour - but usually she still wants stuff and attention from me as well <br/>\nduring those times.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to do some cleaning - Jayn&#39;s idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182668437\">Hello-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question -- well really a few questions -- about some things<br/>\nthat I think you all could help me with. I&#39;ll give you some<br/>\nbackground. My daughter is 2 1/2. She is currently IN LOVE with Dora,<br/>\nwhich means that it is either on the TV or computer whenever we are<br/>\nhome. (and on the DVD player in the car too!) Currently we are home a<br/>\nlot for various reasons -- I babysit two other children and it is<br/>\nwinter here so we haven&#39;t been getting out as much as I like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntellectually I have really embraced unschooling and having no<br/>\nrestrictions on TV, but I know that I am still struggling with it<br/>\nbecause I have been thinking a lot about it lately. I have a couple of<br/>\nconcerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first concern is that maybe I am not doing enough other things to<br/>\nengage her. I realize that this is not a question that you can answer<br/>\nsince you do not know our daily life and how we interact. I guess I am<br/>\nmore wondering if she is happy and I talk on the phone for half an<br/>\nhour, is that ok? (I&#39;m thinking of Sandra&#39;s chart and how much time<br/>\nyou spend with your child based on age) Or cleaning up... or anything<br/>\nelse. I often watch with her and know all the story lines, and can<br/>\ntalk with her about it etc. I am also very aware of making sure to get<br/>\nher food, make sure she&#39;s comfortable etc. But she is only 2 1/2 -- I<br/>\nguess I think if I were trying harder to do more different things she<br/>\nmight watch less. But then I get in an argument with myself -- is less<br/>\nbetter? This seems to be what she really wants right now. Today I<br/>\nwanted to go outside and play in the snow and she really insisted that<br/>\nshe wanted to stay and watch Dora. I tried convincing her for about an<br/>\nhour. Then I feel bad because I don&#39;t want her to think that I am not<br/>\nlistening to her (we didn&#39;t end up going out). However, she often<br/>\nchanges her mind after saying no several times, and I know she would<br/>\nhave had fun outside. It was a rare free morning for us and I wanted<br/>\nto respect her wish to stay in as much as I wanted to go out. But when<br/>\ndo you start (or do you ever?) saying that &quot;Mommy wants to do this now<br/>\nand we will do more of what you want later?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry this is long and convoluted. I had a really long<br/>\nphilosophical conversation with my mom about parenting. I am very<br/>\nlucky to have an open minded and supportive mother, but I know she<br/>\neven struggles with all these ideas I have. I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>\nstraightening this out in my mind, it seems like there are too many<br/>\nconsiderations. But I think to answer my own question, I have to keep<br/>\nour relationship first in my mind (my daughter&#39;s and mine) and I<br/>\nalways think that if I am feeling guilty than maybe that means I<br/>\nshould be offering (strewing) more (or more involved). Any input would<br/>\nbe greatly appreciated! I really feel like with kids, even really<br/>\nlittle ones, most people in our society thinks, they need to learn<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t always get their way, or to entertain themselves, or<br/>\nmany other things... So I still have many voices in my head that I are<br/>\nin disagreement with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan May</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41651,"nextTopicId":41655}}
