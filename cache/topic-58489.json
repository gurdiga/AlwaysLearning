Our twelve and a half year old blue heeler was euthanized a couple of months ago.  I tried to talk Marty out of going.  She was Marty&#39;s dog.  He wanted us to continue testing and treatment and exploratory surgery, kind of.  He didn&#39;t want to say no.  Even if we HAD paid thousands more dollars, she would still have been old and arthritic and had diabetes.  But she had other problems, and we were $1200 in.  It was a horrible decision, for me to say, basically,  &quot;kill her.&quot;   I cried.  Marty cried.   I was afraid he wouldn&#39;t love me anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s more straightforward than a decision about money, that can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the last moment, Marty decided he DID want to be there.  So I decided I didn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t want to see Marty&#39;s grief and feel responsible for it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this is a reminder that things might happen unexpectedly and medically, as Jenny reported, but things might happen unexpectedly emotionally, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI stayed in the waiting room.  Marty was with the dog.
