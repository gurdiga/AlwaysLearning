Up <br/>\nstairs is a large room, which has lectures, demonstrations and indoor <br/>\nfairs.  At times this room is section off for small gatherings. There <br/>\nare community cars.  Part of the land is used for growing food; there <br/>\nis reed bed water filtration, a communal garden and managed <br/>\nwoodland.  All aspects of the land management are organic. The <br/>\nmajority of children are home educated and part of the Social centre <br/>\nis used as a learning centre for both adults and children.  Learning <br/>\nis considered an ongoing process and anything from learning to read <br/>\nto astrophysics is being studied at any one time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nCourses are held by people who have a passion for their subject and <br/>\nwant to share it with others.  These courses are open to anyone; some <br/>\nget the courses for free.  The subjects range from land management to <br/>\ncooking on a budge, from sculpture to decorating & alternative <br/>\ntherapies.  These courses are advertise internationally and a deal is <br/>\nset up with local people to have course participants staying with <br/>\nthem for a fee.
