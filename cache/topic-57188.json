It was just a reminder that hitting wasn&#39;t okay and she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to let it happen. It was firm, but easy - it was said in a <br/>\nclear voice, no pleading, no threatening, just sort of dry, but there <br/>\nwas also some underlying warmth and a sense that she knew that he knew <br/>\nwhat she meant - some respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of parents talk way way way too much. They would do better <br/>\nto work on conveying what they want the kids to really hear by their <br/>\ntone of voice and body language and a few words.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Laura might be a little bewildred by Sandra&#39;s questioning of the <br/>\nuse of the word &quot;safe.&quot;   As a high-falutin&#39; principle, it is a great <br/>\nword. It is a principle of our family life that people should feel safe <br/>\nin our home - safe from physical harm and also from mental and emotional <br/>\nharm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is too big a meaning for a 7 yo to be using because her 5 yo <br/>\nbrother is swinging a blanket at her.  it raised a flag for me that <br/>\nthere is too much talking about &quot;feeling safe&quot; going on. &quot;I don&#39;t feel <br/>\nsafe&quot; would make more sense for a child to say if she&#39;s generally being <br/>\nbullied or abused, not about normal sibling conflicts which, at that <br/>\nage, are often physically acted out. If she said that to a mandated <br/>\nreporter, you might get reported. I&#39;d steer away from it to very simple <br/>\nresponses. Probably, my guess, is that mom is talking like this - in <br/>\nkind of big-picture stilted language, trying to do the right thing, and <br/>\ntrying too hard, so that things are a bit stilted. Older daughter is <br/>\nprobably very verbal and a mommy-pleasing kid and is picking up that <br/>\nlanguage and using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could bottle my friend&#39;s voice on the phone  - she&#39;s so simple <br/>\nand clear and direct and her voice is so sweet, but firm, at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think Laura needs really clear concrete explanations, she&#39;s so way <br/>\ninto her own head and over-thinking everything and trying to do things <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; to the point that it isn&#39;t &quot;real.&quot; And it is sort of unlucky, in <br/>\na way, when a parent &quot;gets&quot; the first kid really well - when their <br/>\npersonalities are alike enough that the second feels sometimes like an <br/>\noutsider. I had this too - to an extent - with Roxana, my middle child, <br/>\nbecause Roya and I were so so much alike and Roxana was not the same <br/>\ntemperament. I&#39;ve learned over the years to SUPER appreciate her <br/>\ntemperament and to take on some of it myself, to my own betterment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - long post and rambly, but I hope there is something useful in <br/>\nthere.

When I&#39;m able to do that, I automatically shift my <br/>\ninteractions with my kids.  It&#39;s not magic, but it can feel that way.  Some <br/>\nchildren are simply more intense than others or their personalities are less <br/>\nsimilar and it&#39;s easy to see them as &quot;the other&quot; or something else less than <br/>\nstellar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that hitting exemplifies stellar behavior, but more that you <br/>\nhave a beautiful boy who behaves like a boy.  What&#39;s beautiful about boys, and <br/>\nwhat&#39;s beautiful about your particular boy, even while he&#39;s in the midst of <br/>\nbeing angry?

She felt unsafe even <br/>\nthough it wouldn&#39;t have hurt. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an outsider looking in, what I saw in that description, even before you <br/>\nexplained further, was a gender divide as well as a middle child issue.  First, <br/>\nwhy was someone sitting on his special blanket?  That may seem like a small <br/>\nthing, but it could be a symptom of something bigger of the siblings around him <br/>\nnot being very mindful of him.   That&#39;s not necessarily something that a sibling <br/>\nmay see or prevent, but a parent could.  If everyone is sitting down to talk, <br/>\nmake sure that nobody is sitting on anyone else&#39;s special anything as they sit <br/>\ndown.  Make sure that this boy has his space and things in a way that no sisters <br/>\ncan interfere, even unintentionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow, along the way the sister have felt unsafe around their brother even <br/>\nwhen they really aren&#39;t unsafe.  I would ask them to stop over dramatizing the <br/>\nsituation.  In the scenario given, without knowing all the subtle nuances, I <br/>\nwould have been very direct in saying, &quot;please scoot over and get off your <br/>\nbrother&#39;s blanket&quot;.  If that didn&#39;t diffuse the situation, then addressing the <br/>\nblanket hitting would have been next.  The brother needs other ways to <br/>\ncommunicate than hitting.  The issue seems to have been a violation of space, <br/>\nwhich he chose to act upon by taking back his personal item and hitting the <br/>\noffending person with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***I&#39;ve been<br/>\nremoving the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests.  This often turns into <br/>\nhim following us and trying to hurt us both.  This, too, feels wrong.***<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps he follows to make sure in a way that his thoughts and ideas are fairly <br/>\nrepresented.  He probably feels trampled upon.  He&#39;s the middle child and the <br/>\nonly boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n***My husband is wonderful and supportive and my son&#39;s favorite person.  He <br/>\nthinks that what my son needs is to know that I&#39;m in charge in these sorts of <br/>\nscenarios.  That in the most gentle way I can he needs to know that I am strong <br/>\nand in charge.***<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, I can see that.  If you are in charge of these scenarios, then you&#39;ll be <br/>\nlooking out for him to make sure he isn&#39;t trampled on by his sisters.  You can <br/>\nprevent him from getting to a place of frustration by being mindful of his needs <br/>\nbefore he feels threatened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat your husband does is sweet, he takes him out of the situation and distracts <br/>\nhim and helps bring him to a better space.  Watch how your husband does it.  See <br/>\nwhat it is that he does that makes the difference.  If you&#39;ve tried to replicate <br/>\nit and it hasn&#39;t worked, what else is he doing different that you aren&#39;t.  Maybe <br/>\nthere&#39;s a level of comedy that you aren&#39;t getting.  Maybe there&#39;s a beginning <br/>\ngrand gesture that literally sweeps him away.  Maybe there are certain toys that <br/>\nare part of the joking and distraction.  Or maybe it doesn&#39;t work because you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t been the rescuer, but have unintentionally made him feel more of a bad <br/>\nguy.  Maybe after you change that around, you&#39;ll be able to be more of the <br/>\nrescuer.  Maybe you won&#39;t even need to anymore.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Aggression","postDate":"1284151219","msgId":57199,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFQjYxMjRCLUUxOTktNEQwMy1CMUQ4LUE3OTRDQ0QzNzg2MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltM280S3pKTm15TFh2cDZiQlNkaFVjSFB3V1VwMkRFdHFDT2dqdEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEVBNDlCRkZGLUY1NjAtNDFCNy05NjE5LUIwODdEMEJDNjM5QUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8NTMxMzguNTU4NDUucW1Ad2ViNTE4MDQubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW0zbzRLekpObXlMWHZwNmJCU2RoVWNIUHdXVXAyREV0cUNPZ2p0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57198,"nextInTopic":57200,"prevInTime":57198,"nextInTime":57200,"topicId":57188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I don t think being charge (even tho you are in charge) is what he s looking for.

I got him<br/>\nsome &quot;sabers&quot; that have electronic sounds. I got oobleck so he could<br/>\nmake wonderful fun &quot;bad&quot; messes. Brian got him some foam Hulk hands<br/>\n(Walmart I think) that make a great noise when you hit something with<br/>\nthem. I showed him how to throw those blinking light up neon balls<br/>\nwith suckers all over them (don&#39;t know the name of them) at the walls.<br/>\nThey stick for a few seconds before falling to the floor. We got a<br/>\nTransformer mask that says &quot;the Decepticons must be stopped&quot; and other<br/>\nthings, and has a separate button to press for a voice changing<br/>\nfilter.

And maybe the girls<br/>\nwill decide they like it at some point and join in. It IS physical and<br/>\nlikely to devolve occasionally into aggressive behavior since the<br/>\nchildren may lack the tools for getting along during physical play.<br/>\nYour own behavior while playing with them can set the tone and over<br/>\ntime, they&#39;ll get the idea. And when it gets out of hand, notice how<br/>\nand when aggression is cropping up. Then you can decide better what to<br/>\ndo when you have more specifics to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an only child and what you described about your son is just as<br/>\ntrue of my child. It would be easy to label him &quot;bad&quot; if I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nabout the needs of different people for large muscle movement. I just<br/>\nheard something yesterday from a retired teacher who said every few<br/>\nminutes, to keep the kids from getting rowdy, it was necessary to<br/>\nbreak up whatever they were doing and suggest the kids stretch or do<br/>\nsome other movement. She says the growth of muscles (I think that&#39;s<br/>\nit) causes gas bubbles to form and get stuck. They&#39;re uncomfortable.<br/>\nShe also mentioned that fear creates a sudden need for lots of<br/>\nmovement and children worry about stuff just like everyone else. *I*<br/>\nhave to move when I worry. Sitting does me no good. She had 4 and 5<br/>\nyear olds and said the same thing works well with older kids and even<br/>\nwith adults. :) Some people don&#39;t need as much movement or interaction<br/>\nand others just do. People are different.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/10/10, Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Can you give some specific examples from the past day or two?
