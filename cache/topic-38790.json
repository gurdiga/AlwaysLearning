You can also talk about the definition of healthy, how young children have a need for sweet and fatty for brain development and how by limiting food to low fat and sugar free you are doing poorly considered harm to that child. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem for the poster of the advice is that they see themselves as their words. It&#39;s understandable, their words are all they have acting as their representative on a yahoo group. That and maybe a sig. line of a blog or a quote that inspires or makes them think. So when someone else comes along and writes about the less limited household, the household whose constraint aren&#39;t &quot;healthy&quot; but are what is wanted and what can be afforded and what is available, the poster of limitations feels attacked. And when someone else comes along and talks about the risks of limitation, the now defensive poster attacks back. And I don&#39;t think there is anything that can be done to make that less likely to happen. Even if the response is kind and gentle and warm, which it often is, the poster will read it with their own layers of bias and fear and infuse the words with tones that may incite them to greater levels of defensiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience it is less likely to happen if the original poster is looking for help. There may be moments when they feel attacked or ganged up on, but it seems having been willing to put their concerns and worries into this and other public forums has already thickened their skin a bit, or made them more receptive, from the off, to the advice they are receiving. When the advice seeker tends to get grumpy and defensive is when something they posted that wasn&#39;t actually what they were asking for help with is examined and dissected, words that they framed their request with, padding to their story. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, those are my thoughts and Linnaea is keen to have the computer, so if I don&#39;t post now I won&#39;t get this posted...at least not for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\n<br/>\nAh - I hadn&#39;t known about the list history.

We&#39;ve learned over the  <br/>\nyears that people tend not to read the &quot;hi, welcome to this group&quot; e- <br/>\nmails, and many join a group without even going to the main page  <br/>\nwhere the group is described, so maybe the best use of such a page,  <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s done, will be to send to people who are in a new-to-group  <br/>\nfrenzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy frenzy sometimes, but I don&#39;t have as much fun when people  <br/>\ncan&#39;t be distracted with useful information or suggestions to read  <br/>\nfirst and then post some more later.  So such a thing would be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this is the format, I know.  A new unschooler wouldn&#39;t go to  <br/>\na conference and go up to the speaker&#39;s podium and take the  <br/>\nmicrophone and  start talking.  It&#39;s easy, I&#39;m sure, to assume we all  <br/>\njust got here instead of that some have been here helping people for  <br/>\nyears.  If Joyce writes one thing and someone else whose name few of  <br/>\nus recognize writes the opposite, those aren&#39;t two equal opinions.   <br/>\nIf the new person has an opinion that dazzles Joyce and sparks some  <br/>\ngreat ideas in other readers, LOTS of people will say wow, that&#39;s a  <br/>\ngreat way to word that--thanks!  Joyce will probably be the first one  <br/>\nto do so.  So it matters, in a situation like this, who is saying  <br/>\nwhat, but not in the way that people have different colored speakers&#39;  <br/>\nbadges or ranks or awards.  It&#39;s something each reader figures out  <br/>\nfor herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nReaders will have favorite posters.  They won&#39;t be the same for  <br/>\neveryone.  I love to see Deb Lewis&#39;s smiling e-mail address in my  <br/>\nbox, but she&#39;s really busy.  When Deb writes, I read twice.   <br/>\nDifferent people for different people.

So  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a flow to all this.  But I was on two lists (and only two  <br/>\nlists, as to unschooling), and one has gone quiet lately.  That one  <br/>\n(now quiet) had a bunch of rules.

Do this<br/>\nfor quite a while.  This is for two big reasons.  The first reason is<br/>\nthat they are relevant.  The problems and questions that you are<br/>\nhaving are not unique.  You can learn a lot by reading these<br/>\ndiscussions about other people&#39;s lives.  Think about them.  Let the<br/>\nideas stew.  Apply them to your life.  The second reason has to do<br/>\nwith manners.  Get a feel for the tone of the list.  This will help<br/>\nyou when you ask questions and when you contribute to the<br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  When posting questions, keep it short. If you can&#39;t do this, maybe<br/>\nyou need to think about your question and your situation a little<br/>\nmore.  Long posts explaining a problem get really old.  It&#39;s good<br/>\nstrategy as well as good manners.  If you start with a long winded<br/>\npost, you won&#39;t have as many people (who might have had something<br/>\nuseful to say) read your post which means they won&#39;t reply.  Those who<br/>\ndo will probably be annoyed that you went on and on and may not be as<br/>\nnice as they might otherwise have been.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Think before you post.  Is it helpful or interesting?  Is it even<br/>\nappropriate?  Lots of people ask rhetorical questions to help you work<br/>\nthrough your problems.  Don&#39;t post the answers to the group.  It&#39;s<br/>\nannoying.  If you are responding to advice that you have been give,<br/>\ndon&#39;t reply right away.  Think about it some more first.  Let it stew.<br/>\n Try it out.  &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; responses to advice, explaining why all<br/>\nthe good advice wouldn&#39;t work for you don&#39;t go over well.  If you want<br/>\nto ignore all the good advice people gave you, please do it quietly.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Remember that this is not a fuzzy support group.  You have not<br/>\njoined a fuzzy wuzzy place where you will be loved unconditionally and<br/>\ntreated the way you would treat your child.  This is a group to<br/>\ndiscuss ideas.  It can be blunt.  VERY blunt.
