Unfortunately, not everyone who allows their children to have an education outside of an institution realizes this.<br/>\nMy questionnaire has been given to homeschoolers as well as unschoolers, and must be the exact same questions to reduce bias.  As unschoolers please look at the question like this:<br/>\nIs/are your child(ren) in contact with one parent more than the other as they live life and learn throughout the day?  Yes/NoÂ—if yes which one? <br/>\nIf anyone is still interested the survey is re-posted below.  Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Unschooling parents,<br/>\n\tMy name is Katherine Love and I am a graduate student at National-Louis University.  I am currently working on a research project for my master&#39;s thesis and gathering data through a brief two-page questionnaire.  The title of my thesis is: The Self-Actualization of Education and the Factors that Affect Motivation in a Classroom Setting.  The &quot;classroom setting&quot; refers to regular school environment.  What I need are participants with children who were educated in public or private school but are now being home-schooled.  The children of parents participating in the study should be between 2nd and 12th grade to have had enough time to compare levels of motivation between the two styles of education.  If you are interested, please answer every question to the best of your ability, I need quantifiable data for the analysis.  The form before the questionnaire is the &quot;informed consent,&quot; which you must read in its entirety (one page) before completing the questionnaire (only two pages).  Then, please save the questionnaire into your word documents when completed so that you can attach it to your return email.  You can email me the completed questionnaire to the following address: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:klove222@...\">klove222@...</a>.  I need as many participants as possible to make my data valid and I would greatly appreciate your involvement.  Thank you very much for your consideration.
