We will most likely watch TV all day. Tessa is sick, 103.5<br/>\nfever. She is hot and a bit pale. The wind is howling, rain expected soon, for<br/>\ndays. Yesterday I hosted a garden class which went very well. The kids made<br/>\nplanter boxes and planted them with bulbs. Riley showed a little girl how to<br/>\nhammer. He even held the nail for her, the brave guy. Tessa stayed inside in a<br/>\nblanket. Ashley is in a Nutcracker Performance for the next several nights. We<br/>\nwent last night, bringing a friend from her school. 250 kids put on this show,<br/>\nit&#39;s a city tradition. So we know lots of the cast and it&#39;s fun to see who you<br/>\nknow in each scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling happy having the family all together for several weeks again<br/>\nwithout the 5 times a week, getting Ashley up and out and then picking her up<br/>\nmid day. I can say this has been the greatest hurdle for me to jump.She loves<br/>\nher class, even though there are mean girls and lairs. She gave her teacher<br/>\ntickets to her show for a gift. I&#39;m going to pick up the room Tessa and I<br/>\nshare. It has become a huge pile of all things.Talk to you all soon,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11353,"nextTopicId":11357}}
