We just discussed this recently,<br/>\nso his thoughts and mine are clear in my memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as kids being excluded, well it&#39;s true that<br/>\nlife is sometimes unfair, but friends should not be<br/>\nrude to each other.  Kids&#39; and adults should be able<br/>\nto invite just who they want to their own parties,<br/>\njust so long as they understand that they could be<br/>\nbruising some egos, stepping on some toes, or even<br/>\nlosing some friends over it.  It&#39;s a sticky social<br/>\nproblem.  How many people agonize over who to invite<br/>\nto weddings or holiday parites?  How many people<br/>\ninvite family members who really are not a part of<br/>\ntheir lives, just to avoid offending them, or invite<br/>\npeople for reasons OTHER than desiring their presence<br/>\n(like not wanting to offend their mother-in-law by<br/>\nleaving out her old friend Edna whom you find<br/>\noverbearing, or whatever.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe usually stick to family only for parties, but then<br/>\nmy kids don&#39;t have a very large social circle yet.  So<br/>\nwe have largely been able to avoid these kinds of<br/>\ndifficult situations.  My husband and I even &quot;eloped&quot;<br/>\nwhen we got married, largely to avoid the complication<br/>\nof a large wedding and the invitations and social<br/>\nentanglements.  It meant no wedding gifts, but was a<br/>\nsmall price to pay for a lovely, romatic, stress free<br/>\nwedding celebration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s an ettiquette question.  Sandra is right<br/>\nthat you should be able to invite whoever you want. <br/>\nBut the situation where the one boy was excluded for<br/>\nno apparent real reason (other boys his age, siblings<br/>\nand neighbors were invited) seems harsh.  It hurts to<br/>\nbe excluded, no matter how old you are, particularly<br/>\nwhen there is no real reason you were left out, aside<br/>\nfrom that you were not wanted.  But I concur with the<br/>\nsentiment that life is what you make of it, and &quot;when<br/>\nlife gives you lemons, make lemonade!&quot;  It&#39;s a hard<br/>\nlesson for a six year old, but an important one for<br/>\nhim to learn to focus on the positive and that he is<br/>\nresponsible for his own happiness and how he views and<br/>\nresponds to challenges in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","profile":"heidi_wd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Excluding Kids","postDate":"1039324983","msgId":11177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjEyMDcyMTIyMDguMDFmOTBmYTBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFNwcmluZ21haWwuMDk5NC4xMDM5MzEzNDE0LjAuNzg4OTk0MDBAd2VibWFpbC5wYXMuZWFydGhsaW4gay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":11176,"nextInTopic":11200,"prevInTime":11176,"nextInTime":11178,"topicId":11176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mary, You re an Awesome Mom!
