It&#39;s one I<br/>\nhave heard various sources hold forth on, both pro and<br/>\ncon.  As a woman, I cannot know what it&#39;s like to be a<br/>\nman.  I can rationalize, I can empathize, I can<br/>\nimagine, but I cannot KNOW, on a real experiential<br/>\nlevel.  To me, the violence in entertainment might be<br/>\ndisturbing, upsetting, scary, etc.  To my boys<br/>\nhowever, who are not female, it may mean something<br/>\naltogether different, and may in fact be vital for<br/>\nthem as a form of expression.  After all, the vast<br/>\nmajority of the violent games, movies and other medias<br/>\nare created by males for other males to enjoy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMen DO tend to be more violent than women, with both<br/>\nmore violent expression in games, movies,<br/>\nconversation, aggresive competitive play, sports etc. <br/>\nI believe that there is a need for them to express<br/>\nthis part of their nature in a healthy way, and to. <br/>\nThere is a time and a place in this world for<br/>\njudicious use of force (because we&#39;re not all Eloi in<br/>\na bland paradise) and I hope my boys go through life<br/>\nnever having to resort to physical self defense, but<br/>\nuse of force can also take place with words and other<br/>\nbody language to avoid more physical conflicts. <br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing men (and baby men) violent outlets in games<br/>\nand entertainment helps release that aggressive<br/>\nbehavior in a healthy way, and helps role play<br/>\nappropriate and inappropriate use of force.  I know<br/>\nALL of us moms here have heard our boys remind us<br/>\n(with much sighing and eye-rolling) whenever we<br/>\nexpress concern or just go &quot;ewww!&quot; at a violent game<br/>\n(with toys, video games, whatever)  &quot;It&#39;s not REAL<br/>\nmom!  It&#39;s JUST a GAME!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a great extent I let my husband (a gentle, strong,<br/>\ncapable man) take the lead in guiding the boys into<br/>\nmanhood, or fielding these issues from a man&#39;s point<br/>\nof view.  As far as violent games, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\nrepression and strict control leads to more relaxed<br/>\nand less agressive men.  I find it more likely that<br/>\nmen who feel stifled and bottled up are more likely to<br/>\nexplode.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21758,"nextTopicId":21763}}
