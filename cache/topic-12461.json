I&#39;ve looked into them, and <br/>\nyurts are SO cool (and I LOVE round)---but a little &quot;too&quot; much for my mental <br/>\nhealth and well-being! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve compromised on a round HOUSE with real walls and such! &lt;g&gt; Only three <br/>\ninterior walls, no doors. There&#39;ll be one great room:living/dining/kitchen, a <br/>\nbath and our bedroom. We&#39;re planning a separate wing for the boys with a <br/>\nliving area, two small sleeping quarters and a bath. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe thought about putting up a yurt for temporary housing while we build, but <br/>\nit looks as if we won&#39;t need to :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could always get a small one on your two acres and have a suana in it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"callingmoon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Yurts","postDate":"1043344367","msgId":12461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWMyYzMwOCQ0ZDA3YjJhMCQ4NzgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwNDU2OTkyNjcuNDc5OC4yNjc1NC5tOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12463,"prevInTime":12460,"nextInTime":12462,"topicId":12461,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Todd, please tell more about this.

My dream as a child was to be a hermit<br/>\n(at least that was the only term I knew then to partially describe my strong<br/>\ndesire for independence and self-sustenance).  Then I gave up &quot;childish<br/>\ndreams&quot; and moved to the big city, met dh and had a pack of kids.  We now<br/>\n(at my insistence) live on a couple of acres in a semi-rural area outside of<br/>\na city.  We partially homestead, raising much of our own food from the<br/>\norganic garden, goats and rabbits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI daydream about living out in the middle of nowhere in a yurt.  When I talk<br/>\nto dh about it, he looks at me from his &quot;brick home with pool, using the<br/>\ncorporate jet&quot; worldview and gives me a non-comprehending stare.  Sigh.<br/>\n(Sadly, I love him dearly so spousal abandonment isn&#39;t an option &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf others aren&#39;t interested, perhaps you could mail me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12601,"nextTopicId":12581}}
