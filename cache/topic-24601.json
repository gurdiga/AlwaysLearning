I know that if I am right  by them <br/>\nwhen a fight starts I can usually smooth things out.  I know  some arguing is <br/>\nnormal in any family :)  As for Daniel (my 4 year old  warrior), we have always <br/>\nhad a lot of LOTR type movies around, as my other sons  and husband enjoy them, <br/>\nand ones like Mortal Kombat, some Jet Li and  Pirates of the Caribbean.  He&#39;s <br/>\nseen them all, and loves them.  He  also has several play swords and large <br/>\nsticks that he has found for  staffs.  We watch the movies with him and talk <br/>\nabout what is going  on.  I think he wants very badly to be a great swordsman or <br/>\nbowman or  whatever, and I think it drives him nuts that he can&#39;t do all the <br/>\nthings he  sees.  Do you have any suggestions (or anyone else for that matter) <br/>\nas to  how to handle the times when he does say hurtful things to people?  His <br/>\n siblings ignore it as they know he is all talk, and I know they don&#39;t feel  <br/>\nterrorized (annoyed, though), but the million other people we run into in  <br/>\ngrocery stores, at the playhouse, neighborhood kids, etc. think differently, I&#39;m  <br/>\nsure.  I tell him that some words are hurtful or scary to others and that  we <br/>\nneed to respect personal space, and I have removed him from situations when  <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t seem to be able to stop.  I was considering replacing the violent  <br/>\nmovies with gentler ones whenever possible, and to ask the older kids to play  <br/>\nmore gently with him (the older boys like to rough house, and he always jumps  <br/>\nin), but perhaps I&#39;ll forgo that.  We watched &quot;Karate Kid II&quot; today and  he <br/>\nseemed to like it.  He&#39;s such a fun, great guy that I  hate to see him <br/>\nalienating himself from others.  As for martial arts  classes, it just dawned on me <br/>\nthat I, along with his oldest brother, both got  our black belts last year, and <br/>\nhe went to tons of our classes and  observed.  I have an air shield here in a <br/>\ncloset (I stopped training last  March so it&#39;s probably dusty) - I think I&#39;ll <br/>\npull it out and offer for  him to pummel it :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks all,<br/>\nSteph<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24424,"nextTopicId":24602}}
