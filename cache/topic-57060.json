In<br/>\nattendance were preschool children - one-third children from the community<br/>\n(who were of a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds), one-third<br/>\nchildren of the professors who taught at the college (again, a variety of<br/>\nbackgrounds), and one-third children of the low-wage employees of the<br/>\ncollege (all of whom were Haitian).  That year, the school was planning a<br/>\nhuge Halloween bash - the children were going to come in costume, there was<br/>\ngoing to be a parade. it was going to be quite the celebration.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the mothers of one of the children, a quiet Haitian woman who worked<br/>\ncleaning the dorm bathrooms and never spoke or made eye contact with the<br/>\nteachers - not even me, a young student teacher - requested a meeting with<br/>\nthe school director.  She explained to the Director that if the school went<br/>\nforward with the celebration, the Haitian families would be forced by<br/>\ncircumstance to find alternate care for their children that day.  Because in<br/>\nthe Haitian culture with which these families identified, Halloween was not<br/>\na day to fool around with - not a day to celebrate.  It has religious<br/>\nmeaning.  It is tied in with voodoo.  It&#39;s not something to be taken lightly<br/>\n(I&#39;m not near expert enough to explain the details - but I&#39;ll guess you get<br/>\nthe picture).  It was very serious business for this woman - serious enough<br/>\nfor her to step out of her comfort zone and ask to be heard.  And respected.<br/>\nDespite her non-mainstream beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Director called a staff meeting.  She asked what people thought should<br/>\nbe done.  All the staff (and student-staff) agreed that it would be<br/>\ninexcusable to hold a celebration that would not only exclude, but insult, a<br/>\nfull third of the children and families served by the school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHalloween came and went that year - with no costumes, parade, or party at<br/>\nthe school.  The children who celebrated Halloween did it on their own<br/>\n&quot;turf&quot; - and the children who didn&#39;t, well, didn&#39;t.  What could have been an<br/>\nawkward, difficult situation became a non-issue, because people chose<br/>\nTolerance and not Righteousness or Belittling or Name Calling or any other<br/>\nchoice that&#39;s out there.  We the Halloween-celebrating weren&#39;t Satanists and<br/>\nthey the non-celebrating weren&#39;t Religious Fanatics.  A little Tolerance,<br/>\nand everybody &quot;won.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson I took from that has stayed with me always.  Just because someone<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do something my way, it doesn&#39;t make them wrong.  And just because<br/>\nsomeone isn&#39;t with the majority, it doesn&#39;t make them bad.  As unschoolers,<br/>\nI would think we would be well aware of what it&#39;s like to be outside the<br/>\nmainstream.  And I, for one, choose Tolerance when faced with or dealing<br/>\nwith someone else whose ideas or beliefs or customs or interests or whatever<br/>\ndiffer from mine.  That Haitian woman all those years ago wasn&#39;t Wrong<br/>\nbecause she believed something I don&#39;t even understand - she was just<br/>\nDifferent than me.  Fundamentalist Christians aren&#39;t wrong because they<br/>\nbelieve what they believe.  They don&#39;t see it my way - I don&#39;t see it<br/>\ntheirs.  But I find no joy or power or anything else in pointing out how<br/>\nright I am and how wrong they are.  I don&#39;t need to point it out at all.<br/>\nAfter all, maybe my way isn&#39;t the right way either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a little blip of film once and the message was &quot;I&#39;m different, you&#39;re<br/>\ndifferent, we&#39;re all ok.&quot;  I think a little of that sort of thinking goes a<br/>\nlong way.  And yes, I understand that one of the things about some<br/>\nFundamentalist Christians is that they would very much like me (and people<br/>\nlike me) to think their way.  And that gets on some people&#39;s nerves.  And it<br/>\nmakes the Us vs Them thing certainly not any better, and probably worse. But<br/>\nI don&#39;t fault them for that either.  It&#39;s just the way they believe (some of<br/>\nthem - not all - I don&#39;t like to generalize - just like I would never assert<br/>\nthat all Haitians believe what that mom believed).  Religions fail if they<br/>\ncan&#39;t get (and keep) new members.  I choose not to be a member - but I also<br/>\nchoose not to criticize those who do choose that for themselves.

And I *know* for a <br/>\nfact, proven many, many times, that choosing &quot;eclectic&quot; and saying <br/>\n&quot;some unschooling&quot; in ANY way leads to some unschooling/eclectic, <br/>\nwhich leads soon to no unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/doit\">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible for unschooling to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This is a growing movement of parents who trust and respect their <br/>\nchildren (and thus want their children to grow up trusting and <br/>\nrespecting their own ideas, instincts and interests). -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there is.

People like that pushed me away from unschooling when I was still homeschooling. I did a little of that when I was new to unschooling, all fired up with enthusiasm - but I don&#39;t want to push grownups buttons any more than I do my kids&#39;. I&#39;d rather set myself up for better relationships First, and see where that goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;educate the public about the benefits of child-led learning<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Trying to teach adults who aren&#39;t interested in what you have to say isn&#39;t any better than trying to teach children and has very similar results - people shut down and become resentful. I certainly did when I was homeschooling, and I was an Advocate of child-led learning... just the &quot;managed&quot; kind, teachable moments and all that stuff. I wasn&#39;t interested in hearing more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts one thing to post a link and a blurb, on facebook, say, that other people can ignore if they want, another thing to give too much information at a social gathering.

So I didn&#39;t mind telling him we were also &quot;eclectic&quot; but a little less formal than what he was doing - no details, although I think by now I&#39;ve said &quot;unschool&quot; but really casually. We each talk about our kids, and I keep my stories light and positive. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast month he had a big &quot;issue&quot; with his dd - 12yo, wanting to wear make-up. He didn&#39;t want her to wear make-up and at first forbade it, then tried to shame her out of it. Finally he asked my opinion. He wanted mine because he sees me as self-confident and comfortable in my own skin and would like his dd to be that way, too. I told him that I&#39;d worn make-up at 12, talked about kids needing space to try things out and &quot;try on&quot; different ways of being sometimes. He thought about that. He wasn&#39;t sure he believed it all, but he told his dd she could wear make-up if she wanted and the next time we worked together thanked me for my input. He thinks it helped his relationship with his kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s big.

But I Do believe it IS important to bring unschooling &quot;into the light.&quot; It shouldn&#39;t be a dirty little secret, when it&#39;s main thrust is to enlighten children&#39;s lives for a lifetime of learning, loving, living in a positive way. How could that be a &quot;bad&quot; thing?  I know that great ideas are often unpopular ideas at the genesis of their acceptance into society.   The key is to slowly, carefully, educate the public about the benefits of child-led learning, through quotes from John Taylor Gatto, John Holt, Fitzenrieter, Sandra Dodd, and a host of other unschooling philosophers. This is a growing movement of parents who trust and respect their children (and thus want their children to grow up trusting and respecting their own ideas, instincts and interests). If you have read as many books as I have on unschooling, and that is why you are doing it, then don&#39;t be afraid to tell the truth about it.  Tell your homeschooling friends about authors you&#39;d suggest to them.  Send a website their way. Explain the reasons WHY we unschool and what GOOD it can do a child to  grow up &quot;unprocessed.&quot; You know those cute little stories about accidental learning we tell our husbands at night so they can be on board?

We&#39;d have a world of kids who were confident, innovative, creative, compassionate, and perhaps not so conditioned into accepting warmongering all over the globe.  They&#39;d believe in their own ideas because they&#39;d have always come to them themselves.   They&#39;d come up with logical solutions and be brave enough to implement them because they&#39;d learned how to trust their own ideas and not follow the heard. As we unschool our children, we have to be brave enough to unschool ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nTokeli<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daisygrrrl72&quot; &lt;daisygrrrl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HI- My 5.5 year old ds and I our starting our first homeschooling group and I am dreading the &quot;What Curriculum are you using?&quot; question.

Sometimes people are just making chit-chat, like talking about the weather.  Or, they may be just checking out if they can feel good about their own curriculum/school choice.  I think that everyone feels just a little insecure and what they are in effect asking is, `am I doing my best?&#39;<br/>\n  <br/>\nSo I keep that in mind when I get that kind of question.  If it&#39;s a social gathering or casual meeting, I like to keep the conversation amicable, so I answer their question, but keep it light.
