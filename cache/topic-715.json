Before making my (prayerful) <br/>\ndecision to unschool, I joined several unschooling lists and read many <br/>\nunschooling message boards.  While I found answers to my questions and <br/>\ndoubts about unschooling, I was also totally shocked at how <br/>\nanti-Christian values they were!  Yet, when I visit Christian <br/>\nunschooling sites and read Christian unschooling books, I find myself <br/>\nfeeling that very few of them are *truly* unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be awesome to find an unschooling board that generally stuck <br/>\nto unschooling without talking about how important it is to pass on <br/>\nliberal values to our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually find myself not really *fitting in* on ANY unschooling <br/>\nboard.  Take the current homosexuality discussion, for example.  <br/>\nSomeone asked how we would feel if our children were homosexual.  Do I <br/>\nanswer the question truthfully and spending an untold amount of time <br/>\ndefending my position, my right to hold that position, and probably <br/>\ndefending my parenting/unschooling skills in general?  Or do I  just <br/>\nkeep quiet and not participate in the discussion so as to not make any <br/>\nwaves (This would mean staying quiet for the majority of the <br/>\ndiscussions that have been on this and other unschooling lists so <br/>\nfar!)?  Or do I go to a Christian group where I would agree with the <br/>\nvalues but would at best find little common ground when it comes to <br/>\neducational philosophy or at worst have to constantly defend my <br/>\nunschooling philosophy? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s a Christian unschooler to do?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; There seems to be a lot of antagonism among unschoolers against <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Christian right.
