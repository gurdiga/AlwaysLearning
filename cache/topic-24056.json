If you are interested in a national <br/>\nteleconference about this topic after the show, please read to the end.<br/>\n*****************************<br/>\nSubject: Stossel 20/20 ABC special on weaknesses of public<br/>\nschooling....Alliance hosts two public teleconferences to discuss<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; <br/>\nwith John Stossel airs Jan. 13 (10 to 11 p.m. ET) on ABC. <br/>\nSee below how to order a copy or transcript.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the words of E Ray Moore, good friend and<br/>\npresident of Exodus Mandate:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now Stossel and 20/20 are set to puncture the last myth of <br/>\ncomplacent suburban <br/>\nparents who delude themselves by thinking that, whatever problems <br/>\nthere may be <br/>\nelsewhere, their schools are &quot;different.&quot; As Stossel and 20/20 point <br/>\nout, not <br/>\nonly do our 12th graders do worse in math and science, for example, <br/>\nthan students <br/>\nin almost all other industrialized countries, the longer our <br/>\nstudents are in <br/>\npublic schools, the worse they do in relation to their international <br/>\npeers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I hate to quibble with my friend Rev. Ray, I suspect<br/>\nit&#39;s NOT the last myth. The &quot;public school&quot; establishment<br/>\nis certainly adept at making up new myths when the <br/>\npublic sniffs the rat in the current myth du jour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe special is set to run Friday night at 10pm Eastern,<br/>\n9pm Central, and again at 10pm Mountain, then Pacific,<br/>\nAlaska, and Hawaii.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Alliance is hosting two teleconferences on<br/>\nFriday night.... open to all our Signatories of the<br/>\nProclamation.... and the public! <br/>\n<br/>\nThat means you are welcome to forward this to<br/>\nyour own email list .... or even your pesky brother-<br/>\nin-law who thinks things are just ducky in HIS<br/>\nlocal school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how you connect:<br/>\n<br/>\nFIRST TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be held 15 minutes after the show<br/>\nairs in Eastern and Central time zones:<br/>\n<br/>\n11:15pm Eastern.......10:15pm Central<br/>\n<br/>\nMountain and West Coast people are welcome<br/>\nto come on and get a preview, if you will, from<br/>\nthe reactions of those who have already seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:15pm Mountain....... 8:15pm Pacific.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlaska and Hawaii folks.... and even those in<br/>\nEurope who want to get up in the middle of<br/>\nthe night....are welcome, too. But you gotta<br/>\nfigure out the time for yourself. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECOND TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nA second teleconference will be held three hours<br/>\nlater: 15 minutes after 20/20 airs on the West Coast:<br/>\n<br/>\n11:15pm Pacific<br/>\n    which is 12:15am (Sat) Mountain<br/>\n    and 1:15am Central, 2:15am Eastern<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may get some Brits on the second teleconference,<br/>\nas it will be 7:15am Saturday morning in England.. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I was on the phone for an hour this morning with<br/>\nJames Stanfield at the E G West Centre in England<br/>\ndiscussing the show. James Tooley, Director of the centre<br/>\n(who will receive the Alexis de Tocqueville Award at SepCon2007,<br/>\nMay 4-6, Dallas, was just back from India and his sleep<br/>\npattern may have him fit to join us. <br/>\n<br/>\nHOW YOU DIAL THE TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing your cell or regular telephone, from your<br/>\nown easy chair at home---or driving down the<br/>\nhighway---- dial this number at the appointed hour <br/>\nin your time zone above:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 (319) 632-1100   pass code 682-129 #<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a noisy background, just press 6<br/>\nto mute yourself. When you want to say <br/>\nsomething, press 6 again to un-mute.<br/>\n<br/>\nMISCELLANEOUS STUFF-----<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Stossel is apparently quite active in his<br/>\nblog and frequently responds to emails.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to sound off with praise or a <br/>\nsuggestion about a future education special,<br/>\nor both, you can do so here:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154\">http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154</a>&gt;  <br/>\nor, if that is busted, try this link:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/9qz5p\">http://tinyurl.com/9qz5p</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier, he wrote &quot;If you would like to purchase a tape or dvd, dial <br/>\n800-505-6139; <br/>\nfor a transcript dial 818-848-6500.

How absurd. As if government schools are <br/>\nhigh quality. <br/>\nIn Florida, and most places, competition, which made even the Postal <br/>\nService <br/>\nimprove, is unconstitutional when it comes to public education.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read the entire E Ray Moore news release about<br/>\nStossel&#39;s education special, click here:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earnedmedia.org/em0111.htm\">http://www.earnedmedia.org/em0111.htm</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n======================================<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Here is an interesting attack<br/>\non Stossel for his attack on public<br/>\nschools in an earlier &quot;Give Me a Break&quot;<br/>\nsegment.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fair.org/activism/stossel-education.html\">http://www.fair.org/activism/stossel-education.html</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt shows the stretching the Public School<br/>\nEstablishment can do to parry all attacks<br/>\non it.
