You have to figure out who is married to whom, and which women are sisters.  You get info like:  only one couple is sitting next to each other.  The man with glasses is married to one of the sisters.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy son would like to get a puzzle book that has ONLY those types of puzzles. We have done Top Secret and Which Way USA from Highlights, and they would have maybe one of those types of puzzles per issue.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDoes anyone know of a book or website of those types of puzzles?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDoes anyone know if those types of puzzles have a specific name?  If I knew what they were called, I might be able to track something down.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJennie\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Logic Puzzles","postDate":"1256829052","msgId":48177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZDNURDQTU3LTIzQzUtNEYzNC05QTc2LTY4OEUxNEQ3RUExNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBRTlBQ0EwLjEwOTAxMDhAbWluZHNwcmluZy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhjYzkwZStnYWxuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEFFOUFDQTAuMTA5MDEwOEBtaW5kc3ByaW5nLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48175,"nextInTopic":48179,"prevInTime":48176,"nextInTime":48178,"topicId":48172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Those sound like one of the problem types on the LSAT.

Yeah, right, I&#39;m thinking.   AS IF.    So I did other stuff  <br/>\ninstead.
