I would love to <br/>\ncreate a pattern for these for my Dd who have never taken to the <br/>\nwhole idea of tampons.

Mine tried them <br/>\nbecause all of her friends were using them, but she simply could not <br/>\ndo it, could not bring herself to insert one.  So she rejected them <br/>\nand has stuck with winged pads.  I stopped using tampons back in the <br/>\nlate 1970s when the TSS link with tampons first hit the media.  Then <br/>\nthere was the business about the little plastic things washing up on <br/>\nbeaches, which made me happy I had only ever used OB when I did use <br/>\ntampons.  Glad to hear that lots of other women have considered and <br/>\nchosen other options.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Other Flannel Pad ideas","postDate":"1074569592","msgId":18145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTIwMDMzMzEyLjIxNzIucW1haWxAd2ViNDA0MTIubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwNDAxMTkxODU4MjIuMDEyNGZlODBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":18137,"nextInTopic":18146,"prevInTime":18144,"nextInTime":18146,"topicId":18137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s what the ones I made look like (glad rags)...She wants to use organic disposables when she s out and about, because she doesn t like to carry a purse,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-448386387\">That&#39;s what the ones I made look like (glad<br/>\nrags)...She wants to use organic disposables when<br/>\nshe&#39;s out and about, because she doesn&#39;t like to carry<br/>\na purse, and she doesn&#39;t want to start just so she can<br/>\ncarry a bloody, used pad ;)  I understand completely<br/>\n:)  I&#39;d proabably do the same in her case :)<br/>\nDana<br/>\n--- Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Although my 11 yo hasn&#39;t started her period yet, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have made her some really pretty cloth pads, (snip)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her preferences will be, she thinks (cloth pads at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;home, (snip) and organic pads with wings<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for when she&#39;s out)...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dana,<br/>\n&gt; You might want to google the &#39;Glad Rags&#39; brand of<br/>\n&gt; flannel pads... not to <br/>\n&gt; necessarily buy (although they are nice people and a<br/>\n&gt; very small woman-owned <br/>\n&gt; company) but to look at the design.
