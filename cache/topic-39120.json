It&#39;s a pretty happening place. :) They exist to perform the community <br/>\nfunctions of churches in their members lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago is a democratic fellowship and <br/>\nspiritual home for those who seek a rational, compassionate philosophy of life <br/>\nwithout regard to belief or nonbelief in a supreme being. We value the importance <br/>\nof living an ethical, responsible, and joyful life. We promote intellectual, <br/>\nphilosophical, and artistic freedom, avoiding dogma and rigid creed. We nurture <br/>\na sense of wonder about life, nature, and the universe, and are inspired by <br/>\nmodels of human achievement. Shaped by the forces of humanism, democracy, <br/>\nscience, and religious reform, we cherish human diversity and focus on what we have <br/>\nin common, not on what keeps us apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile respectful of the faiths and traditions we may have been born to, we <br/>\nserve as a new religion or as an alternative to religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe care for and support each other, sharing our joys and sorrows. Like <br/>\ntraditional religious communities, we celebrate births, conduct wedding ceremonies, <br/>\nhost memorial services, and provide for the caring, ethical education of our <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe in deed beyond creed and in working for a better world. We <br/>\nrecognize the worth and dignity of every person, and strive to act so as to bring out <br/>\nthe best in others and thereby in ourselves. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they allow homeschoolers use of their wonderful building space dirt che<br/>\nap. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah, in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nNew MapQuest Local shows what&#39;s happening at your <br/>\ndestination.
