This was my  <br/>\nresponse on the side to someone who complained that people  <br/>\nmisunderstood or misinterpretted something she said:<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\nI was responding to ideas and statements in several posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease review the list intentions.  Joyce wrote most of it;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has to write on the list, but what is written there will  <br/>\nprobably be discussed.<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s anyone here who hasn&#39;t seen that page, please do read it.   <br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read it before it wouldn&#39;t hurt to glance down and make sure  <br/>\nit&#39;s the same stuff you saw the last time.  Sometimes it gets additions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing was a complaint on another list about links being  <br/>\nprovided.  I think it was a complaint that questions weren&#39;t answered  <br/>\nat great length directly to the person asking, directed only to that  <br/>\none individual, without reference to prior discussions on the same  <br/>\ntopic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an accompanying and confusing suggestion that my site was  <br/>\ntoo long and too much like a syllabus, and yet not large enough to  <br/>\ncontain several guessed-at URLs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce has written enough to fill a dozen books, and she has done so  <br/>\npatiently and sweetly, from her own time and energy, on a computer  <br/>\nwith internet that she and her husband paid for.  So after a while she  <br/>\nmade a website so people could read those things without having to ask  <br/>\nin public in advance.  But I don&#39;t mind one bit when Joyce sends a  <br/>\nlink to go with something she&#39;s just written.  I think it&#39;s great!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started collecting discussions, I think the first one was about  <br/>\nTV, because Ren Allen had totally changed her mind, and the process of  <br/>\nher seeing the value in TV was worth keeping so others could read it  <br/>\nlater.  That is here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/debate\">http://sandradodd.com/t/debate</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGiving people access to the best of what&#39;s been discussed in the past  <br/>\nseveral years seems good to me.  Anyone who would complain about that  <br/>\nmust not have thought much about what their real options are, in  <br/>\nlearning about unschooling, or what the relative value of available  <br/>\nresources might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list has some of the most thoughtful unschoolers and the best  <br/>\nwriters among thoughtful unschoolers there are out there.  I think  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve stayed because the topics have been of a caliber to make them  <br/>\nwant to stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen very-beginner questions are asked, the links will come out,  <br/>\nbecause there are MANY things we assume people know before they  <br/>\nparticipate on a list designed for people who have read some John Holt  <br/>\nand who are already involved in unschooling.  So if someone joins the  <br/>\nlist who is new, that&#39;s okay, but they will probably be reminded that  <br/>\ntheir ideas and suggestions are coming from a place of inexperience.   <br/>\nThe reason for providing links is so that people can see what&#39;s  <br/>\nalready been discussed so they&#39;re not asking the same basic questions,  <br/>\nor so that Pam S. , Schuyler, Deb Lewis and such folks aren&#39;t spending  <br/>\ntheir time repeating what they have already so eloquently written  <br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51254,"nextTopicId":51266}}
