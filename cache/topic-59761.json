Reading about Sandra&#39;s daughter Holly choosing a new bed, or one of her son&#39;s not taking a loan for a car, Pam&#39;s daughter&#39;s spending (or lack thereof) in France....keeps me secure that by giving as much as I can, I will only help Noor feel fuller, not more needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread, and the frantic cleaning we did all day in preparation for a gathering tomorrow, reminded me of a post I wrote a while back on Always Unschooled.  I just re-read it--I messed up how old she was when her dad donated the toys, she was about two, not three or four.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the post, in response to a mom concerned about hoarding and too many toys (excuse the dramatic rhetoric, please...I&#39;ve mellowed tons since then):<br/>\n<br/>\n----&quot;[Noor] has drawers of feathers, felt, fabric, beads, buttons, bits and bobbles,<br/>\ncostumes, rocks, sticks, empty containers, dead and dried bugs and plants,<br/>\npieces of taken apart things, art supplies, and stacks of cardboard boxes (some<br/>\nreally big ones from new toilets my parents bought awhile back). This list is<br/>\nnot exhaustive.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has a LOT of stuffed animals and puppets. We counted them all a year<br/>\nago and there were well over (I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to admit this) 100. We have<br/>\nour own plush zoo, seriously. And she plays with ALL of them all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a month before Halloween, she started making costumes for many of<br/>\nthem--there were days I couldn&#39;t get her out of the house because she was so<br/>\nengaged in her WORK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this isn&#39;t the point I was going to make--The massive amount of stuffed<br/>\nanimals is something that really bothers my dh--simply because of the clutter. <br/>\nHe isn&#39;t bothered at all by the creative mess of the other, more artsy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I reflected on her stuffy collection, I remembered that when she was quite<br/>\nyoung, maybe 1.5 or two, dh decided to do a massive purge. We were living in<br/>\nan 800 sqf house and we&#39;d cycle the toys by putting containers in the basement. <br/>\nOne day dh went through everything and brought two containers to Goodwill.<br/>\n<br/>\nFLash forward a year or two or even three, and dd asks for one of the things<br/>\nfrom the basement. But its long gone. You can see the sense of betrayal in her<br/>\neyes and hear it in her words when she asks how we could have given her things<br/>\naway without her permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I thought about something else she still talks about--when dd was about<br/>\n1.5, dh was holding her while standing near the toilet and she dropped her paci<br/>\nin. I fished the paci out of the toilet and threw it in the trash. I told her<br/>\nthat we could never get it clean enough to use again. At the time, she was a<br/>\nlittle upset, but it passed quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she still talks about her &quot;favorite green binky&quot; that &quot;dad&quot; threw in the<br/>\ntrash! She knows how we sterilize things with rubbing alcohol, and after we&#39;ve<br/>\npulled a tic off the cat or something and are cleaning the tweezers, she&#39;ll<br/>\noften bring up the binky and ask why we couldn&#39;t sterilize it--why did we have<br/>\nto throw it away? Why couldn&#39;t she have kept it, even if she couldn&#39;t put it in<br/>\nher mouth? She is emphatic that we should have saved it for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m getting at is these &quot;things&quot; are much more meaningful to our young<br/>\npeople than we usually recognize. If I add some of my Lacanian baggage to the<br/>\nequation, I can even see how these &quot;things&quot; are REAL extensions of their sense<br/>\nof self--our (adults) chucking/donating/stashing the stuff is, in this regard,<br/>\nactually an act of violence against their subjectivity (sorry).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this has spun way off from the center of the question: &quot;how many toys are<br/>\ntoo many toys,&quot; but the additional posts about hoarding got me going....(and<br/>\ngoing and going and going)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more quick realization--both of my grandmothers were collectors. I still<br/>\nhave shoe boxes with jars of buttons and zippers cut from old shirts, jackets<br/>\nand pants, pieces of 40 year old twine salvaged from newspapers, elastic straps<br/>\nfrom worn-out bras and the waistbands of slips. When I need to run an extra<br/>\npiece of elastic through my slender daughter&#39;s pants, I use the &quot;scraps&quot; my<br/>\ngrandmother saved. And now, when dd asks that I not throw something away<br/>\nbecause it will be &quot;useful,&#39; I clean out another drawer, or find a box, because<br/>\nshe obviously knows what she&#39;s talking about.&quot; ------<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Overrun by Toys","postDate":"1297746710","msgId":59777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrckFVUEtLWXRQWlZidTZQSz1MVkJFcE9rTUMrcWRTMEYzUEFCbUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqY3FhYStzcW9xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqYzI5ZCsxN2RqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aWpjcWFhK3Nxb3FAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59776,"nextInTopic":59778,"prevInTime":59776,"nextInTime":59778,"topicId":59761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I very recently had a habit of tidying the various toy containers, throwing away things I perceived as no longer fun or useful (an inflatable jousting toy that no longer held air, a cracked-into-two pieces plastic army helmet, a pretend set of headphones with one earpiece missing). I thought that I *had* to do this since my son, 5, also didn&#39;t want to get rid of any toys (he has never once given up a toy, either for donation, trade, or passing along to a cousin or friend) and we were running out of places to put things. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut instead, I found that in doing this I unleashed an in-home dumpster diver. My son, convinced that I was going to throw away something that he loved, or loved once and wasn&#39;t ready to let go, started going through the recycling containers and trash in each room. He&#39;d sift through piles of dirt in the dustpan (looking for tiny Leggo pieces, beads, etc.). And just a couple of nights ago, he ran out of the house yelling after me as I took the trash to the curb, convinced that he had missed an opportunity to rescue some treasured item that I&#39;d cast aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was clearly disturbed by *my* purging of *his* stuff. He was anxious and frantic. I sure did lose his trust as someone who&#39;d help him take care of the things he liked having around.

I really do think that will help. Also, I&#39;ve been asking about every single thing I find that&#39;s he&#39;s touched if it&#39;s OK to throw outpieces of yarn, sticks and rocks, oddly shaped cardboard scraps, markers that barely have ink in them. I don&#39;t know if this will help him trust me again, but I&#39;m hoping.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, and this is just a maybe in my mind, but I&#39;m coming to discover that he really truly envisions a purpose for all these household items and toys, or a circumstance in the future in which it might be fun to play with them.

I know with shows like the Hoarders and the like, it&#39;s easy to pathologize and get nervous about accumulating stuff, but did you see the movie &quot;Wall-E&quot;? Do you remember his little tin-can house with a rotating rack of container after container of cool stuff? Parts and pieces for making things whole and fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can get that about my boy.

While reading these responses I came up with another question which I&#39;ll get to at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fairly organized already.  Our garage is at it maximum capacity for storage shelving like the Gorm or the costco industrial ones.  We have about 10 shelving units.  We also have already filled 30 of those clear 60 quart containers and the rest is stuffed into boxes and piled elsewhere.  Quite frankly, I now believe my husband and I have an overconsuming problem and have not set the example for our son that I wanted to.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I want him to have lots of toys to play with.  But, due to money and space we can&#39;t do it all and I have not done a good job representing consuming balance to my son (not exactly sure how to do it myself, but, I am working on it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inside of the house has several shelves and cubby areas for his toys.  When I do stop to think about it, he probably does play with everything over time.  I was just jumping to the conclusion that he didn&#39;t play as much because at Christmas when Santa brought him his first Bruder truck, he played with it non-stop and seemed so excited.  Then the rest of the gifts poured in and now he has 13 bruder trucks and doesn&#39;t play with them as much as he did his first one.  And 13 Bruder trucks was only the tip of the iceberg for holiday/birthday gift (Christmas and his birthday happen 4 days apart).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings do have a tendancy to pile up and then it is hard to play with anything let alone walk through our small house.  I&#39;m currently trying to downsize my things to find more places for the toys that we have inside so that they don&#39;t end up so heaped.  It is difficult and very overwhelming for me right now...so the process moves slow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand the reasons for not getting rid of his existing toys that he wants.  For the future though, we are bursting at the seams here.  We really have A LOT of things and toys.  Most of it I know is our doing.  And I have every intention of working to change my own buying habits, but we are already in space/versus posession trouble.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally I&#39;ll get to my question :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son however is now very used to buying toys everywhere we go.  Is it fair to the child to cut back on the future purchases when he REALLY believes that he wants it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate everyone&#39;s advice and patience with me as I am trying to make the transition into different ways of being and thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You,  Silva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dicie_B&quot; &lt;dicie_b@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband and I are feeling overrun by toys, my son has so many toys....it can be more than a little embarrasing.

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she could name every last missing one.  His desire to purge &quot;junk,&quot; &quot;clutter,&quot; damaged the trust she placed in him and I sometimes wonder if it didn&#39;t create more desire for things on her part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that it can feel overwhelming, all the stuff, especially if you don&#39;t have a lot of storage space or a way to organize.  But I&#39;d caution that just because *you* are going through a &quot;plan to simplify and downsize&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean it is fair to make your son, who hasn&#39;t had a long lifetime of collecting, give up what is important to him.  You&#39;ve felt the whole range of ownership of things for many years. He hasn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n---I am not able to keep up with all the stuff we own though----<br/>\n<br/>\nWhose clutter is it? Get rid of your things, that you don&#39;t want/need--that will probably create a whole lot of space.<br/>\n<br/>\n--and am worried about my son growing up thinking that it is great or expected to be surrounded by such clutter.----<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  Seriously.  Look at that feeling--what are you afraid will happen?  He&#39;s four--what horrible character trait do you think he&#39;ll develop by having a sense of abundance? Sit with it for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you grow up surrounded by a lot of stuff and clutter? With so many toys that your parents would have been embarrassed?  Probably not--and yet look! You&#39;ve amassed all this stuff over the years, so much that you can&#39;t walk through your house comfortably now feeling the desire to &quot;simplify and downsize.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of our rampant consumer culture is perpetrated by people who were NOT raised with a sense of abundance.  The biggest shoppers I know came from very controlled environments, in terms of behavior and finances.  I have a nephew who spent the first five years of life living in a (very organized) school bus while his parents traveled the country planting trees.  He wasn&#39;t allowed to have any toys that were larger than a shoe box.  Today he owns over 100 pairs of sneakers.  I&#39;m not kidding.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* your son is interested, you could help him cull through his belongings. He may be interested in selling some if he knows he can use the money for new things.  Our daughter recently agreed to sell a dollhouse that had never really been used to buy an older/no longer made Mega Blocs set on Ebay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion is to get organized.  If you live anywhere near an Ikea, they have simple and inexpensive shelving units that you can customize.  We recently bought some new ones, enough for three walls total, and it cost less than $300 (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S69881288)\">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S69881288)</a>. We actually have bare shelves! Something I never thought possible.  We put them in our living room and studio, but I imagine they&#39;d be fantastic lining the walls of a garage.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvest in some plastic totes, preferably see-through.  They are cheap, stackable and great for storing toys.  I bet you could buy five and they&#39;d hold a TON of his toys. Clean up is super simple when all you have to do is chuck toys into a bin. <br/>\n<br/>\n----I&#39;ve noticed though that the more he has the less he plays with it and more he complains of being bored.  ----<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have you noticed this?  Did he recently not have a lot of toys and played more and now suddenly he has a ton of toys and plays less?  Maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;ve really observed...it just sounds like something parents say, but isn&#39;t necessarily true.  If his toys are hard to get to or find, try to find a way to make them more accessible and more organized. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that has helped my husband, who is a very minimalist kind of guy, except for &quot;gear,&quot; is to remind him that Noor doesn&#39;t spend 30+ hours a week somewhere else--her life happens, for the most part, at home. Her toys/things are the materials she uses to LEARN. Her stuff is very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":356074576,"authorName":"Dicie_B","from":"&quot;Dicie_B&quot; &lt;dicie_b@...&gt;","profile":"Dicie_B","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Overrun by Toys","postDate":"1297714285","msgId":59761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqYzI5ZCsxN2RqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59763,"prevInTime":59760,"nextInTime":59762,"topicId":59761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband and I are feeling overrun by toys, my son has so many toys....it can be more than a little embarrasing.
