I read their  <br/>\nwords, I liked their ideas, I have met them at conferences, or  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been to my house or I&#39;ve been to theirs.

Anyone can create a yahoolist.  It takes just a  <br/>\nfew minutes.<br/>\nThe list has a purpose, which I maintain and defend.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s think about &quot;authoritarian.&quot;  It&#39;s a kneejerk insult word, easy  <br/>\nto throw out.  Is it &quot;authoritarian&quot; for me to care about what  <br/>\nhappens in my house?  A dad was here once who threatened to spank his  <br/>\ndaughter, in my house, and I said no you won&#39;t, not in my house.   <br/>\nThat was authoritarian.  It was also for the benefit of the  <br/>\ndaughter,  nor for the dad.  Was I not &quot;mindfully respectful&quot; of the  <br/>\ndad?  I was not.  I was mindfully respectful of his child and my own  <br/>\nthree.  I was defending and maintaining the peace of my home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I suggest that a mom needs to pay more attention to what her  <br/>\nkids want, and the mom starts whining about me not respecting her,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a problem in the mom, and will be a problem for the child.   <br/>\nBut it&#39;s not a problem for MY kids, because I have for years (nearly  <br/>\n21 years)   worked to find ever better ways to be with them  <br/>\npeacefully and gently and openly, and have seen other families do it  <br/>\nand seen their relationships be good, and have seen families come  <br/>\nnearer to these practices and seen their family relations improve.   <br/>\nI&#39;m confident, and have experience with others saying &quot;I thought you  <br/>\nwere crazy at first, but when I did those things, our family got  <br/>\nbetter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who know my kids, and if I were hypocritical there  <br/>\nwould probably only be fourteen people on this list instead of 1400.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Control freak...&quot;<br/>\nThat&#39;s because I put a couple of irate posters on moderation, on a  <br/>\nlist I&#39;m responsible for keeping productive and peaceful?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be the opposite of control freak, then?  I don&#39;t see it as  <br/>\nfreakish or controlling to make suggestions that might help moms who  <br/>\nvoluntarily came and asked for suggestions.  No one &quot;had to&quot; come  <br/>\nhere.  No court is ordering any mom to take part in any unschooling  <br/>\ndiscussions.  No one has to &quot;attend&quot; unschooling classes to be  <br/>\ncertified.  It&#39;s all choice.  There are other unschooling lists.   <br/>\nLots of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see it as freakish or controlling for me to ask people to  <br/>\nchill or to put someone on moderation for writing &quot;kiss my ass.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263624845,"authorName":"Tia Graham","from":"Tia Graham &lt;tia@...&gt;","profile":"clarasmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] about tantrums, mindfulness and strength","postDate":"1180960389","msgId":29063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2NjQwNjg1LjYwODA3MDhAc2l4cmVkaGVhZHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENFM0Q4NkQyLTFCRUEtNEI5NS1COTEzLTREOEEyOEUwQjE5OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENFM0Q4NkQyLTFCRUEtNEI5NS1COTEzLTREOEEyOEUwQjE5OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29047,"nextInTopic":29068,"prevInTime":29062,"nextInTime":29064,"topicId":29047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Unfortunately, those who can not apply this same mindful respect to fellow adults can not be taken as credible advisers in how to deal with children.
