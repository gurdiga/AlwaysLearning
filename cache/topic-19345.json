As a baby, she&#39;d slam her forehead on the floor <br/>\nuntil she bruised, often leaving rug imprints on her skin.  She&#39;s shut <br/>\nher hands in doors to inflict pain to herself.  I&#39;ve talked with her <br/>\nabout it and tried to surround her with love and support.  In the last <br/>\nyear since we&#39;ve been wholeheartly living an unschooled lifestyle, she&#39;s <br/>\ngetting a lot worse.  It&#39;s still mostly threats and talk, but it really <br/>\nupsets me.  I know she knows that, so part of her talk might be for <br/>\ndrama, but still.  Some of what she says is coming from the movies she&#39;s <br/>\nwatched.  I don&#39;t want to police her viewing like I used too, especially <br/>\nbecause her older sisters would have to bear the brunt of that then, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you had a child do this?  Perhaps some people have a <br/>\ntendency toward self-destruction when they are frustrated or unhappy. <br/>\n How can I help her now?  If I don&#39;t it will only get worse as she gets <br/>\nolder.  So if any of you have any suggestions for me or know the <br/>\nappropriate place to get supportive and constructive help, I&#39;d really <br/>\nappreciate it.  Thanks,  Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19635,"nextTopicId":19587}}
