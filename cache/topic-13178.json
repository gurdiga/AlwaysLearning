This morning I was thinking how grateful I am<br/>\nthat I was given the opportunity to create the life I want, which includes<br/>\nhaving kids that are self directed learners.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning the kids made a massive bed out of putting the couches and the<br/>\nall the cushions together while they watched Toy Story 2.  DH, the kids and<br/>\nI then went to Krispie Cream to watch them make donuts and eat them.  Mum<br/>\nmet us there and the kids enjoyed that too.  DH and the Max are now washing<br/>\nthe car (it&#39;s going to be 90 degrees today) while Zak is making a river<br/>\noutside putting rocks and sticks from the back door through the garage and<br/>\nonto the sidewalk.  DH is leaving for his men&#39;s group at 1:30pm when I&#39;ll<br/>\ntake over.  The kids and I are going to a pottery class for a couple of<br/>\nhours this afternoon and then home for dinner.  Zak talked to his friend<br/>\nAuden on the phone this morning and read him a book about how germs make you<br/>\nsick and how you can help prevent them in the future (Auden&#39;s brothers are<br/>\nsick).  Zak also made a card for each of Auden&#39;s brothers and we stopped at<br/>\nthe post office on the way to Krispie Cream to mail them to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m grateful..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful that Steve got fired for the 2nd time 6 weeks ago and can now be<br/>\nhome with the kids<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful that I have a home business that can support our family financially<br/>\nso we can have days like today.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful that I have support for having self directed learning kids<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful that my kids are healthy, happy and love to investigate the world<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful that each day begins and ends with a sense of freedom and peace<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t have when we were rushing around &quot;trying&quot; to fit in with The<br/>\nJones&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful for the knowledge, experience and wisdom I read on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13173,"nextTopicId":13183}}
