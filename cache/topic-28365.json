My 4 year old daughter likes to help with laundry and dishes, but not with running the vacuum (she doesn&#39;t like the noise). She also likes to help make meals.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Letting your son help provides him with an opportunity to be with you while also showing him the process of taking care of the household/family.  I think that it&#39;s fine to try and find an activity that he likes, and tell him that you need to rest or take a break and let him gradually get used to occupying himself for a short time.  Start out with maybe 5 or 10 minutes of playing with playdoh or trucks or something, and then come back to him.  Then increase the amount of time that you let him play by himself.  He will learn that you are going to come back and play with him and he will also learn that he can be creative and learn on his own.  Ask him what he did while you were resting, and he can tell you all about it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  These are things that have helped me with my own children, but ultimately it will be a trial and error of developing a strategy that works for both of you without causing conflict.

Tell him: &quot;I&#39;m going to take a break for half an hour  <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m tired.&quot; While it&#39;s important for kids to know we take  <br/>\ntheir needs seriously, it&#39;s important to take our own needs seriously  <br/>\ntoo. (It&#39;s just really important to distinguish between our needs and  <br/>\nthe huge list of &quot;have tos&quot; we often accumulate.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could brainstorm with him some ideas for things he can do for  <br/>\nhalf an hour. You could set a timer and when it&#39;s done *do* go to him  <br/>\nso he knows you&#39;re dependable. You could save up some of his favorite  <br/>\nshows and put one one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when you&#39;re tired you can tell him &quot;I&#39;m getting tired. I&#39;ll be  <br/>\nable to play for half an hour and then I need a break for half an  <br/>\nhour.
