I put in etymology of zucchini and found this:<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory and etymology<br/>\nZucchini, like all summer squash, has its ancestry in the Americas. But <br/>\nwhile most summer squash--including the closely related cocozelle and <br/>\nmarrow--were introduced to Europe during the time of European colonization <br/>\nof the Americas, zucchini is European in origin, the result of spontaneously <br/>\noccurring mutations (also called sports). In all probability, this occurred <br/>\nin the very late 19th century, probably near Milan (early varieties usually <br/>\nincluded the names of cities in the area in the name). Courgette comes from <br/>\nthe French name of the fruit, with the same spelling. It is a diminutive of <br/>\ncourge, meaning squash. While &quot;zucca&quot; is the Italian word for squash, and <br/>\nthe feminine diminutive plural &quot;zucchine&quot; is preferred in most areas of <br/>\nItaly, the male diminutive plural &quot;zucchini&quot; is used in other areas of <br/>\nItaly, Australia, and the United States. The first records of zucchini in <br/>\nthe United States date to the early 1920s. It was almost certainly brought <br/>\nover by Italian immigrants, and probably got its start in California.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/zucchini?cat=health\">http://www.answers.com/topic/zucchini?cat=health</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;C Johnson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:piscesmomx3@...\">piscesmomx3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com\">alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;; <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion@...\">unschoolingdiscussion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 18, 2007 8:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Word Derivatives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My 7 yro son has been asking me all the time why things are called what <br/>\n&gt; they are.
