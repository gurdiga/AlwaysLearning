None of the stuff we did was graded, except<br/>\nfor math, which was a self-paced program that you worked through by doing<br/>\na pretest, then completing whatever stuff the pretest showed you needed<br/>\nto learn, then post-testing, then either going on or doing more stuff...<br/>\nbut it was all mastery-based, if you got some problems wrong it just<br/>\nmeant you had to do that chapter... it was cool, not perfect, but<br/>\ndefinitely my best school experience.
