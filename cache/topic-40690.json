Support them and respect them. Never belittle  <br/>\nthem or their interests, no matter how superficial, unimportant, or  <br/>\neven misguided their interests may seem to you. Be a guide, not a  <br/>\ndictator. Shine a light ahead for them, and lend them a hand, but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t drag or push them. You WILL sometimes despair when your vision  <br/>\nof what your child ought to be bangs up against the reality that they  <br/>\nare their own person. But that same reality can also give you great  <br/>\njoy if you learn not to cling to your own preconceived notions and  <br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of thirteen items Pam Sorooshian wrote up in response to  <br/>\na question on a state list.
