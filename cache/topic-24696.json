And I always knew I would homeschool. Things were great my son was doing really well until I officially started homeschooling. The homeschooling group I joined appeared to be unschooling and child led in their philosophy but advice and information was all curriculum directed.  Following this direction kind of ruined things  for my child. For several years things were really bad for him me and our family.  So we  have gone back to unschooling.  It has been a little over a year.    I must admit at the time I didn&#39;t know there was a name for it un schooling or child led or parent attachment. We were just naturally doing it. Thing are getting back to a good place for our family now.<br/>\nI have several support groups and a umbrella group for overseeing home instruction.  Others I have talked to suggested I join this and couple other groups, where there is a wealth of information and support. I hope to be more of a advocate in the child led philosophies with my groups. I hope to find lots of  valuable information, both help me in my personal journey but also help member of my group understand more about the of child led choice as a way of life. <br/>\nThank you T    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Grame Family&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scatterville@...\">scatterville@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 14, 2006 2:03 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: This group is growing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi I wanted to introduce myself.
