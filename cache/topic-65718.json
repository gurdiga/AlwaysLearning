There is a danger of<br/>\nintroducing the &quot;formal&quot; versions of these things too soon. Much better to<br/>\nlet them experience powers of ten in real life a whole bunch of times over<br/>\na period of years before you give it any kind of formal existence in her<br/>\nmind. Same with adding, multiplying, fractions, decimals, percentages,<br/>\ndivision, exponents, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister adopted a child who had been severely abused and neglected and<br/>\ndeprived of ordinary childhood experiences. She was 6 years old and, in<br/>\nschool, was learning to read. She was able to sound out words, but they<br/>\noften had no meaning for her. She could read out loud: &quot;I saw a zebra.&quot; But<br/>\nshe did not know what a zebra was. Similarly kids can perform a LOT of math<br/>\nwithout deeply understanding what they are doing. How do you divide one<br/>\nfraction by another? I bet you think you know. (Flip the second fraction<br/>\nand multiply them.) But why does that work and why would you ever do it?<br/>\nYou probably never even wondered about that, I mean, why would you? You<br/>\nthought that dividing fractions was something you &quot;knew.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your daughter is a lot like my youngest was - she did really<br/>\nenjoy manipulating numbers - playing around with how numbers worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of responding to that by giving her little mini-lessons and<br/>\nquizzes, introduce games that might interest her. A game related to powers<br/>\nof ten that my daughter enjoyed a lot (which might sound a bit boring to<br/>\nread about, but she really really liked it) was this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPut a dollar bill out on the table. Put a pile of pennies and dimes out.<br/>\nYou need one die. Take turns rolling the die.<br/>\n...If she rolls a 5, then she can take 5 pennies from the pile.<br/>\n...Then it is your turn. If you roll a 2, you take 2 pennies.<br/>\n...Her turn - if she rolls a 6, she can take 6 pennies. BUT now she has<br/>\nmore than 10 and must exchange 10 pennies for a dime. So now she has 1 dime<br/>\nand 1 penny in front of her.<br/>\n...Your turn. Let&#39;s say you roll a 1. Then you take a penny. You don&#39;t have<br/>\n10 yet, so no exchanging for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep going - if someone gets 10 dimes they get to trade that for the dollar<br/>\nand win the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can let the winner keep the dollar, but if you play it a lot, remember<br/>\nshe&#39;ll win about half the time. So we&#39;d just put the same dollar back and<br/>\nplay for it over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she really likes it and has the patience, you could put a bunch of 1<br/>\ndollar bills out and make it so that a person has to get 10 one-dollar<br/>\nbills to exchange for the 10 dollar bill. That would be a long game,<br/>\nthough, so don&#39;t start with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you have a bunch of coins sitting out on the table, you might play<br/>\nsome NIM games, too. These are strategy games - and can be very simple or<br/>\ncomplex. Here is a simple example:<br/>\n<br/>\n...put 20 coins out all in a row.<br/>\n...alternate turns<br/>\n....person 1 can pick up either 1 or 2 coins.<br/>\n...person 2 can pick up either 1 or 2 coins.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWinner is the person who picks up the last coin.<br/>\n(Or for a slightly better game, the goal can be to force the other player<br/>\nto pick up the last coin.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make these NIM games much more interesting - but that&#39;s the basic<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another good one:<br/>\nLay out 12 coins in 3 rows. Row 1 has 3 coins, row 2 has 4 coins, row 3 has<br/>\n5 coins.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternate turns - on a turn you can take any number of coins but only from<br/>\nONE row on a turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer who takes the last coin wins. (Or switch that and make the goal be<br/>\nto force the other player to take the last coin.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 10:13 AM, catfish_friend<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:catfish_friend@...\">catfish_friend@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had noticed that my 5.5 year old seems to enjoy counting play money or<br/>\n&gt; even just count but I knew that she didn&#39;t know place values yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digits/places/powers of ten","postDate":"1329675212","msgId":65736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJCNUUzODEyLTc4MTYtNEY5Ri04NTdDLUU5N0FGRDhEMUEwQkB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5QTM1MTIwLUYzMDQtNDI4NS05OTMxLThENzE4NjU0MDAxOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc2RUQ5RkRDLTVCRjYtNDJEOS1BQzcxLTNEODE5QkI0NTE5MkB5YWhvby5jb20+IDxDOUEzNTEyMC1GMzA0LTQyODUtOTkzMS04RDcxODY1NDAwMTlAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65732,"nextInTopic":65745,"prevInTime":65735,"nextInTime":65737,"topicId":65718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How much of that did you pour into her head? How much of that did she discover on her own by trying out and playing with the ideas that were swirling around her when interest and need struck her?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s playing games that involve numbers, she&#39;ll see and use and play with the concepts of place value without ever needing to know what it&#39;s called or how it works. She&#39;ll get a *feel* for how numbers work by using them. Those feelings will grow into understanding even if she doesn&#39;t realize it, even if she can&#39;t explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as she&#39;s learned how to change the tenses of verbs to match time and person without being aware of what tenses and verbs are. And she can do it with regular and irregular verbs without giving it a thought. She has grown a feel for it from being immersed in language, trying words out. She picks up feedback -- even when you don&#39;t consciously give it -- to see how well it worked and she makes adjustments, most of the time without conscious thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can show her cool things numbers do when you think of it, if you think she might be interested. Judge how much to go on by her engagement. Is she interested or just indulging you until you shut up and she can get back to what she was doing? ;-) Ask if you&#39;re not sure! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430148316,"authorName":"Joy","from":"Joy &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt;","profile":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digits/places/powers of ten","postDate":"1329635426","msgId":65720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4QzJCQjc3LTEwMjMtNDVCOS05NjRGLTg2QUYzRjgxNTE0NUB5bWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc2RUQ5RkRDLTVCRjYtNDJEOS1BQzcxLTNEODE5QkI0NTE5MkB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDc2RUQ5RkRDLTVCRjYtNDJEOS1BQzcxLTNEODE5QkI0NTE5MkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65718,"nextInTopic":65722,"prevInTime":65719,"nextInTime":65721,"topicId":65718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just want to share my observation of how my son plays with number.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-801789406\">I just want to share my observation of how my son plays with number. I heard children could learn math naturally but didn&#39;t really know how that would happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. He learned percentage by watching the downloading process. Also he learned number to 100. This was when he was about 4. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. He played &quot;teach me kindergarten&quot;. He was totally motivated by the coins he earned so he could buy fish food. In the beginning he had to use the counting hints. This was when he about 4 or 5. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. When he played minecraft, he needed to allocate how many blocks from the pile of 64 blocks. Also when he designed his structure, he needed to use numbers and math. This was when he was 5 and 5.5. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. In the last 3 months, he showed intensive interest in math. He has been doing calculation a lot, all by himself. He would ask me sometimes to confirm or sometimes to inform me his answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings like<br/>\nWhen we headed to a place, he asked me how long it would take. I said, 15 minutes. He would say, oh, that is 900 seconds. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr he would calculate how many years ago it was 1960. (must be some tv he watched about 1960)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was really into big numbers, like billion, trillion. One day he said, mama, I love you one billion trillion. I said, wow, there are lots of zeros. And he said, yeah, 21 zeros. (he knew billion has 9 zeros and trillion has 12 zeros)<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to show how to do addition the way I was taught. He was not interested. I offered to show him multiplication, he refused. So far that was the only two times I tried to offer to teach. Both times he refused. He has been learning in his own way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, he asked why one week is seven days. I said, I have to look it up. But I guess we can make 10 days per week. So how many weeks will we have then. He said, 3. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am amazed how he figured things out without being taught. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow he knows all the money, time, dates...<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes he can explain how he gets his answer. Most of the time he would say, my brain does the work or I don&#39;t know how to explain. <br/>\n<br/>\nJihong/joy<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 19, 2012, at 12:34 AM, catfish_friend &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:catfish_friend@...\">catfish_friend@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My 5.5 year old has been playing Tap Fish 2 and has coins (points) around 50,000.
