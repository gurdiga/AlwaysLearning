I let my low self-esteem and fear of rejection keep me from <br/>\noffering, after a number of rejections.  I&#39;m happy now with the way things <br/>\nare turning out, but I often wonder how things would have turned out if I <br/>\nhad kept offering things all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is *offer*, with refusal being a clear choice.   I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you can really schedule such things, though I understand your desire <br/>\nfor order.  &lt;g&gt;   I think the more choices they have, the more comfortable <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to be with picking and choosing.  If you only offer something <br/>\nonce a week, it&#39;s going to seem like a *big deal* to all of you.  If you <br/>\noffer things as you notice them, maybe a bit of information or an activity <br/>\nyou&#39;ve read about, books and materials lying around, museum memberships <br/>\nthey know they can use when they want to. . . all the time letting them <br/>\nknow that it&#39;s *their* education, and you&#39;re only there to help.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Interacting","postDate":"1014138947","msgId":4977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4yN2JlOTc1LjI5YTNlMjQzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4975,"nextInTopic":4991,"prevInTime":4976,"nextInTime":4978,"topicId":4957,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/18/02 8:19:15 PM, homeschoolmd@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-458010957\">In a message dated 2/18/02 8:19:15 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschoolmd@...\">homeschoolmd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Should *most* of the interactions be child led?

Lots of people like to say that, but I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s too one-sided.  The questions above are too technical, too <br/>\n&quot;measured,&quot; too clinical.  Maybe you have to start that way to get the feel <br/>\nof it, but ANY counting is ultimately wrong.  Once you&#39;ve played with the <br/>\nkids and interacted with them and get in the habit of doing that, you will as <br/>\na group move from one thing to another more naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to suggest going somewhere, don&#39;t worry if you&#39;ve done it every <br/>\nday all week, or not for the past month.  It should be the going and doing <br/>\nwhich are the focus, rather than the calendar and the initiator.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s a game or activity at home you&#39;re interested in doing, get the <br/>\nstuff out.  See if a kid asks.  Or ask if they want to play a game after <br/>\nlunch.  Don&#39;t just listen to the words, look at their eyes and faces and body <br/>\nlanguage and tone of voice.  If they&#39;re grudging, start playing but be <br/>\nwilling to quit after a game or two.  If they&#39;re enthusiastic, consider <br/>\nplaying longer, or learning another version of the same game.  But be aware <br/>\nas things unfold whether it&#39;s still fun for everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Would *limiting* offering new activities to once a week be about the <br/>\nright amount to keep from taking charge of their learning?
