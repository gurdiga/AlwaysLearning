Anyway, I have a funny story about that -- my now 3 year old ds has been using the potty like a girl.  Every now and then he wants to try it &quot;like daddy&quot; but it never worked out.  So this week, he stood up to the pot and tried it like a boy and it made it.  He looked at me so excited and said..<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;I did it!  I&#39;m strong!

I  <br/>\nwould say &quot;let me brush for a month,&quot; and I would stand behind and  <br/>\nbrush while singing the days of the week to Yankee Doodle.  One  <br/>\n&quot;week&quot; per quarter of mouth.  Sometimes they&#39;d let me do more.   I  <br/>\nwould tell them the whole song was a month!  But some months had  <br/>\nextra days.<br/>\n<br/>\nHitting...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hold the child and talk about the hitting while removing her from  <br/>\nthe area and saying hitting doesn&#39;t help, hitting makes it worse or  <br/>\nwhatever seemed appropriate, and sometimes rocking (swaying) helped.   <br/>\nThe older they got the more likely I was (especially with the boys)  <br/>\nto remind them that hitting is illegal and they  need to figure out  <br/>\nother things to do.   That if daddy hit a man he would have to go to  <br/>\njail, and even big strong people learn to use words or to walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t talk her to death, just say real things, as appropriate each  <br/>\ntime.  Maybe dance to music while you&#39;re holding her.  Maybe she just  <br/>\nneeds a different point of view, time to breathe and relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nterrorizing the cat:<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;NO.&quot;  I defended the kids from the pets and the pets from the  <br/>\nkids.  I reminded them about claws and teeth, and said &quot;touch nice or  <br/>\ndon&#39;t touch at all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\npotty training process:<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed diapers until they wanted to stop using diapers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty needed nighttime something (small adult diapers worked better  <br/>\nthan pull-ups) for several years, and I just was patient and cheerful  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s cheaper to use a diaper than to wash the covers every  <br/>\nday and buy a new mattress after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet it be gradual.  Let them go more naked on warmer days, let them  <br/>\nplay naked in the back yard if that&#39;s an option and they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98455799,"authorName":"Natalie","from":"&quot;Natalie&quot; &lt;emerybehmed@...&gt;","profile":"emerybehmed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Intro & 2 1/2 year old stuff","postDate":"1208201114","msgId":34302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1MGIycStmNjlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34303,"prevInTime":34301,"nextInTime":34303,"topicId":34302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry, I realize that I probably should have created a new post with my response to the Alphie Kohn thread: I had posted about 2 1/2 year old behaviors (or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-188779291\">Sorry, I realize that I probably should have created a new post with <br/>\nmy response to the Alphie Kohn thread:<br/>\n<br/>\nI had posted about 2 1/2 year old behaviors (or frustrations), <br/>\nwondering how you would handle them from an unschooling approach:<br/>\n<br/>\ntoothbrushing<br/>\nhitting<br/>\nterrorizing the cat<br/>\npotty training process<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very excited about this group and have learned so much from <br/>\njust taking a look through the posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to the group and have a 2 1/2 year old daughter.
