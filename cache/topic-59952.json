There&#39;s more but which of  <br/>\nthose you choose and what order you&#39;d put them in for various  <br/>\nsituations is what will define what &quot;works&quot; means and what &quot;best&quot; means.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what makes the Always Learning list and others like it so  <br/>\nvaluable.

And a few others I can&#39;t remember.  I slowly pared down to those two and this one.  And then when I felt like I was spending too much time on lists, I thought about which one was &#39;best,&#39; or had the most integrity (for me, that meant exploring the ideas thoroughly, being open to posters writing in things that aren&#39;t true while trying to find the truth, and I&#39;m not sure what else).  For a while, I was torn.  Unschooling Basics has what seems like a kinder atmosphere, but that&#39;s because that list is more about direct advice, which seemed helpful at the start, but made me uncomfortable after a while because I wasn&#39;t understanding the underlying reasons of unschooling so well. I&#39;m a type who likes books with theories which I can then apply, rather than my husband who likes books with examples which he can read and then crystallize into over-arching concepts.  For me, Always Learning helped me understand better, without always feeling like I had to go DO what I learned right away without letting it sink in or be internalized as true. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways Unschooled felt almost like this list, except that I preferred Sandra&#39;s (And Joyce, and Pam, and so many others) opinion over what I read there.  This list takes some getting used to... its hard to separate out what you are writing in to ask from your real life, because it will be twisted and torn and pulled apart in order to examine all of the ideas.  I&#39;ve learned that if I&#39;m not ready to hear things I don&#39;t want to hear, then I shouldn&#39;t ask that particular unschooling question here yet (except maybe to ask for links to read about the topic).

Always Unschooled focussed on the idea that it WAS possible to unschool someone who was just born, or years from compulsory school attendance age.  &quot;the Radical Unschooling list&quot; was called radicalunschoolingLOA or some such for a while and then the name was changed to attract a larger and more general audience.  Not in an honest or good way, but to mask the Law of Attraction element of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Law of Attraction has absolutely nothing on earth to do with unschooling.  It&#39;s not helpful to unschooling.  Someone who once wrote &quot;some of us have gone beyond John Holt and Sandra Dodd runs that list and the name was changed in hopes of it appearing to be THE list on radical unschooling.  Not so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways Unschooled is not (I don&#39;t think) still moderated by the original moderators.  When someone starts a  list and doesn&#39;t stick with it, the list&#39;s focus and tone often are diluted or changed, and so it&#39;s not what was original intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children were always unschooled.  At 24, 22 and 19, they never were enrolled in any school, nor did we ever do school at home.  By the definition of that list, though, perhaps, they weren&#39;t &quot;always unschooled.&quot;  And by the definitions of that list, someone who unschooled from birth to four, then &quot;unschooled for four years.&quot;  Because that proposed definition was disputed by me and others here, the other list was created.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople should be on whichever list they like, or on two or three or five, if they want to be.   Information from more than one source is good.   At least one of the lists above discourages people from exploring other sources.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis list was started because on unschooling-dotcom (which now exists as unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups, and which was revived with that other name by other people later) there were people who made a habit of disruption and bullshit, and I created this list so that those who were rational and thoughtful and didn&#39;t love trouble could discuss unschooling in a serious manner.  Many people stayed on both lists (including me, after a time).  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling basics split from this list (or maybe from unschoolingdiscussion, of which I&#39;m 1/3 owner), but not in a negative way at all--as a place for newer unschoolers to go for more basic information, after which (the original plan went) they would be sent here.  But people get used to and enjoy the others they&#39;re reading and dealing with, and so some people stayed there for years and didn&#39;t come over here.  Unschooling basics, too, went through other moderators from time to time, but at least one of the originals is still moderating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list will be ten years old later this year, and this post will be about # 59,892 unless someone posts quickly before me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other lists split off of unschoolingdiscussion, but non grew large and flourished.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96062561,"authorName":"truth_seeking_mommy","from":"&quot;truth_seeking_mommy&quot; &lt;emtonnotme@...&gt;","profile":"truth_seeking_mommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Could someone please clarify for me?","postDate":"1298299681","msgId":59952,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqdHR2MStnaWJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59954,"prevInTime":59951,"nextInTime":59953,"topicId":59952,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What differentiates this list from the Always Unschooled list and the Radical Unschooling list?
