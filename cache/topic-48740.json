It&#39;s about<br/>\nhow Mark Bittner, who lives in Telegraph Hill (San Francisco), was searching<br/>\nfor his vocation.  He tried playing music, and he found himself working all<br/>\nkinds of miscellaneous jobs, but he didn&#39;t know what to do with himself,<br/>\ncareer-wise.  He starts reading poet Gary Snyder, and decides to start<br/>\nfeeding some of the local birds in an attempt to &quot;get back to nature.&quot;  He<br/>\nfinds himself fascinated by the local non-native parrots, and becomes very<br/>\ninterested in them.  His interest morphs into a passion, and eventually<br/>\nfinds himself borrowing cameras to take pictures, buying professional film,<br/>\nkeeping daily logs, and becoming a real nature scientist.  He reads all he<br/>\ncan about the birds and eventually writes a book.  No one had ever really<br/>\nbeen able to study parrots in their native habitat because it was too<br/>\ndifficult, but he is able to study them in S.F.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link about Mark Bittner <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wildparrotsbook.com/\">http://www.wildparrotsbook.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand you can view it on Netflix Play Instantly.  I watched it with my five<br/>\nand three year old, and I can say everyone in the family really enjoyed it.<br/>\nThe birds are amusing to watch, ( my three yr old son was often cackling at<br/>\ntheir antics,) and with Mark&#39;s back stories on the birds, it&#39;s really<br/>\ninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\nBaltimore<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Nov 20, 2009 at 3:53 PM, lalow66 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lalow@...\">lalow@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Heather&quot; &lt;brownsplus2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some schooled kids are told by their parents that homeschooled kids are<br/>\n&gt; not learning b/c they are not in school. I don&#39;t care what people tell their<br/>\n&gt; kids. However, when those kids (9 year-olds) come to my house and make those<br/>\n&gt; remarks to my kids when I am not in the room, I am offended.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dont know about your specific situation but in the past for us it isnt<br/>\n&gt; that the kids have been told that homeschooled kids are not learning. It has<br/>\n&gt; been that they have been told that the reason they have to go to school is<br/>\n&gt; to learn and if they dont, how will they learn xyorz.<br/>\n&gt; One little boy came up to a friend of ours and asked her, not meanly or<br/>\n&gt; anything, how she knows how to read since she doesnt go to school. His<br/>\n&gt; parents had never said anything like that but they had told him when he<br/>\n&gt; asked why he had to go to schoool that it was so he could learn to read. So<br/>\n&gt; he assumed you dont learn to read unless you go to school. As soon as he<br/>\n&gt; found out that you can indeed learn without going to school he has been<br/>\n&gt; begging to be homeschooled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48643,"nextTopicId":48727}}
