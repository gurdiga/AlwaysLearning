I grew up in Puerto Rico where it basically <br/>\nrains every day and where we get at least 12 big storms a year (one <br/>\nper month --not counting hurricanes). I know rain. I can smell rain <br/>\ncoming. Storms? That&#39;s different --my blood pressure is low to begin <br/>\nwith but when a storm is coming, forget it, I feel like I have a car <br/>\non top of me. I get migraines that will not go away until the sky <br/>\ncracks open. Even breathing is hard on my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to make sure I drink tons of water but I also have looked at <br/>\nAyurveda for help. I usually make a tea with ginger and cayenne <br/>\npepper to bring my blood pressure up. It helps A LOT. Also <br/>\nexercising, especially if I do some yoga. Stay away from starches, <br/>\ncow milk and anything that will slow down your digestion. Anything <br/>\nspicy and aromatic but light is good. There is also help in <br/>\nhomeopathy and I think Nux Vomica or Sepia can help as well (I have <br/>\nto check).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I completely understand what you are talking about.
