I think that might have been something to do with how she was feeling about the whole weekend.          In turn she probably thought my kids would just go along with her.     Playing with their cousins was more of a pull.        They don&#39;t get to see them very much. My kids have started to say that they don&#39;t want to stay at this Grandparents house.    And I asked why....my dd (8) said because Grandpa wouldn&#39;t  let her talk to me on the phone one time when they were talking care of them.      He didn&#39;t think she needed to talk to me.    Thought it would cause problems,  make her sad.         Well,  not letting her talk to me made the sadness,  and us leaving her there.        It won&#39;t be happening again.        They are in the mind set that &quot;everything is just fine!  You&#39;re OK,  stop that crying.&quot;     &lt;Big Sigh&gt;         I will also,  probably make our stays alot shorter from now on.         I guess I&#39;m beginning to figure out why some of my dh&#39;s siblings don&#39;t want to get together with G & G.
