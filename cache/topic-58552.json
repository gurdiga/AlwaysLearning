(Or inspire  <br/>\nGermans since it isn&#39;t translated yet.) It sounded so much like  <br/>\nunschooling all the way through and what unschoolers&#39; lives can look  <br/>\nlike after unschooling. I think he&#39;d &quot;get&quot; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And everybody told me “You guys… what do you want to do when you are  <br/>\n&gt; thirty”? And I said “It’s not important what I’ll do when I’m  <br/>\n&gt; thirty, it’s important what I’m doing now”!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I feel very good, making music; enjoy every day by doing what  <br/>\n&gt; I’m doing. Like Buddha said “The way is the goal”! That’s the point!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What most people don’t understand… They think that here is the magic  <br/>\n&gt; moment… The magic moment is every day!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was reading the paper; there was a very important star from  <br/>\n&gt; Germany who said “If you want to be successful you have to work your  <br/>\n&gt; ass off”! I remember I went to my girlfriend and said “Look. I think  <br/>\n&gt; I know what I have to do. I’ll tell people not to work their ass  <br/>\n&gt; off”… Do what you like to do! Have fun and the money comes by itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not everybody becomes a Rockstar, no! It’s only a way that the  <br/>\n&gt; Scorpions did everything wrong in the beginning, to find out at the  <br/>\n&gt; end that they did everything right! Most people listen to other  <br/>\n&gt; people about what they have to do. Look inside and you will find out  <br/>\n&gt; what to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like Paolo Coelho… He was 40 when he decided he wanted to be an  <br/>\n&gt; author. His mother said “What? Your father is an architect, your  <br/>\n&gt; uncle is a doctor! And you want to do something which can’t bring  <br/>\n&gt; any money… That’s wrong”!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That’s the reason I wrote the book. I wanted to give the people an  <br/>\n&gt; example, if you believe in yourself… Most people make decisions  <br/>\n&gt; because of the money… Then you are the slave of money! No fun  <br/>\n&gt; anymore… People who want only money, they are never happy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You know, our first roadie… he had no job, he wanted to be a roadie.  <br/>\n&gt; He had to carry 20 speakers to the stage, he was working like crazy  <br/>\n&gt; but he was happy! We drove together in a bus and he was a part of  <br/>\n&gt; it! Now he has his own house!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I see so many guitar players that they are so much better than me…  <br/>\n&gt; but they don’t realize what they have… They are never happy… That’s  <br/>\n&gt; the book, with stories and how I came into the music… But the key  <br/>\n&gt; point is to inspire people… “Rock your life” is kick your ass, do  <br/>\n&gt; what you want to do and believe in you!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the article is here, mostly about the Scorpions fair well  <br/>\ntour and reflecting back:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4968&type=1&lang=EN&sub=\">http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4968&type=1&lang=EN&sub=</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58540,"nextTopicId":58560}}
