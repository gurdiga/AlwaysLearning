I&#39;m sure it will be a really  <br/>\ngreat gathering.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like for the Always Learning list to be filled with chit chat  <br/>\nabout gatherings or conferences, for several reasons.  They&#39;re  <br/>\nregional, and expensive, and off topic, mostly.  Yes, they can be  <br/>\nhelpful, but they&#39;re not necessary for unschooling to work.  Most  <br/>\nfamilies can&#39;t afford them.  We paid full price once, for Holly and  <br/>\nMarty to go to North Carolina, and it was a strain for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if there were somehow (squint your eyes and twist  <br/>\nyour brain to follow this analogy) university courses in unschooling  <br/>\nthat would help unschoolers get it, they might be worth taking, and  <br/>\nwould cost as much as a conference but be much less fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want to talk about a symposium I&#39;ve organized, and why, and why I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t talking about it much sooner.  And after this I won&#39;t talk  <br/>\nabout it on the list, so if you&#39;re interested, e-mail me and I&#39;ll add  <br/>\nyou to my announcements list and start collecting money  and  <br/>\nreservations this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wanted to do has not been done, and isn&#39;t likely to happen  <br/>\nagain.  I wanted Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll and myself, in  <br/>\nperson, in the same place, with all our husbands and our kids. It&#39;s  <br/>\nset up now, and barring emergencies, is happening January 7-9, 2010,  <br/>\nin northern New Mexico.    People whose words you&#39;ve read and whose  <br/>\nkids have been &quot;poster children&quot; for years will be all in one place,  <br/>\nin person.   And not to be morbid or anything, but not many people now  <br/>\nunschooling ever heard John Holt speak in person.  I didn&#39;t, and he  <br/>\nwas even in New Mexico after I was interested in education.  This  <br/>\nmight be one of those things you can look back on in the future and  <br/>\nsay &quot;I was there when Joyce, Pam and Sandra were all in one place.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I had already signed up to speak at three conferences, and two  <br/>\nwere also in the southwestern U.S., I felt wrong about telling people  <br/>\nto save their money to come to Santa Fe.  It&#39;s within range of San  <br/>\nDiego and Phoenix.   I didn&#39;t want to seem to conflict with what  <br/>\npeople were already offering me compensation (flights and rooms) to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m ready now, though, and I need forty families who have unschooled  <br/>\nat least five years and who have a teen.  If I don&#39;t get forty of  <br/>\nthose, I&#39;ll open it up to families with younger kids or less experience.<br/>\nAlternately, the conference would be good for parents of younger  <br/>\nchildren who leave their children at home, or who bring another adult  <br/>\nto stay with the kids and find them things to do in Santa Fe or around  <br/>\nthere.   Driving is better than flying, or flying to Albuquerque and  <br/>\nrenting a car could work well.  It&#39;s off the path of public  <br/>\ntransportation, pretty much.  But if you wanted to take the light rail  <br/>\nto Santa Fe (or fly into  Santa Fe if you&#39;re decadently wealthy) and  <br/>\nuse taxis in Santa Fe, that&#39;s a possibility.  You might want a car to  <br/>\ngo up to Ten Thousand Waves (Japanese hot-tub/spa, in the tall pines),  <br/>\nor skiing or snowboarding at Ski Santa Fe, if you&#39;re so inclined.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be the first and best conference for which an EXCELLENT  <br/>\narrangement would be for two or three dads, or two or three moms, to  <br/>\ncome without families and share a condo.  This could be a great  <br/>\nvacation for unschooling parents who have made friends with other  <br/>\nparents they don&#39;t get to visit much.   And honestly, if the kids got  <br/>\nvideo games for Christmas, they&#39;ll still be mesmerized back home and  <br/>\none of the parents could sneak off to Santa Fe pretty easily; maybe  <br/>\nboth, if there are awesome grandparents or other caretakers the kids  <br/>\ntrust to feed them during video game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost conferences emphasize the social aspect, and have workshops to  <br/>\nintroduce people to how unschooling works.  I want zero beginner  <br/>\nquestions, and all very-advanced sharing of unexpected outcomes.  I&#39;ll  <br/>\nbe learning too, if we take all our &quot;Yes it&#39;s working; how and why did  <br/>\nit work?&quot; energy and bring it into one place where we can discuss  <br/>\nthings in depth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site is &quot;Fort Marcy Hotel Suites&quot; but the name is misleading.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a hotel; it&#39;s a timeshare condo complex with one main  <br/>\nbuilding.  People&#39;s doors open to the outside, there are steps, it&#39;s  <br/>\nhilly, and could be snowy or icy.  We don&#39;t have lots of rooms, we  <br/>\nhave one big room for presentations and evening meals, and a breakfast  <br/>\nroom that could be used for gathering and visiting during the day.   <br/>\nAll the activities will be focused and together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most expensive parts of conferences can be the food and the  <br/>\ncost of the rooms.  Our condo rates are very low, but can&#39;t be had  <br/>\nunless one is registered for the conference in advance.<br/>\nEach condo has a full kitchen and so food can be prepared  <br/>\ninexpensively.   Dinners will be shared in the conference room--two  <br/>\ncatered as part of the conference fee (not fancy catering, but plain  <br/>\nand fun), and one will be a potluck.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby and Marty will take and set up Rock Band and Beatles Rock Band  <br/>\nin their condo, and other kids are welcome to go there and hang out.   <br/>\nThere will definitely be a session of the teens and young adults  <br/>\ntelling stories and answering questions, and one for dads only, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe condos can be packed full.  Two families would fit into a three- <br/>\nbedroom.  A two-bedroom will hold probably four or five people  <br/>\neasily.  Any one-bedroom will hold three people, unlike hotel rooms.   <br/>\nThe living rooms all have either a couch someone can sleep on, or a  <br/>\nfold-out bed, or both.  You could bring a futon from home, too, if you  <br/>\ndrive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will furnish firewood and kindling, and each condo has either a  <br/>\nfireplace or wood-burning stove.   That might not sound good this  <br/>\nweek, but in January in northern New Mexico I can tell you for certain  <br/>\nthat it&#39;s magical.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore information is on this page and blog, and I&#39;m ready to register  <br/>\nattendees.
