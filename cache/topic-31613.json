There&#39;s no way to know in advance whether the tone and  <br/>\nmood will be hostile or supportive or what.  I&#39;ve thought through  <br/>\npossibilities, and I&#39;m prepared for just about any eventuality but am  <br/>\na little concerned about the idea of &quot;fairness,&quot; so I hoped to get  <br/>\nhelp with that, and so it seemed a good first topic for a series of  <br/>\ntopics I&#39;d like to keep going.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;series&quot; I mean a random serial set.  By &quot;set&quot; I mean some subset  <br/>\nof the universe, real and imagined.  The topics I have picked out for  <br/>\nthe first three are fairness, wood and bass [guitar or whatever  <br/>\nmusical bass].  Deborah Cunefare has suggested walls, ice and felt-- <br/>\nall good wintery topics (with apologies to Australia and New Zealand).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/\">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n(There&#39;s the topic blog.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore radio show details are here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/2007/12/quotes-generator-and-\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/2007/12/quotes-generator-and-</a> <br/>\nradio-interview.html<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t be available to hear afterwards, and I&#39;m in the middle  <br/>\nhour.  The website preserves the first hour of free-for-all call-in,  <br/>\nbut not the middle hour where the interviews are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the topics blog, though, sometimes parents say they&#39;re at a  <br/>\nloss for ideas for strewing, or that they don&#39;t feel creative.  This  <br/>\nmight be an aid in that area--strewing for the parents.  Some weeks  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll probably have no interest in the topic, but sometimes it might  <br/>\nbe a &quot;whole unit study&quot;!  (I&#39;m joking, but then again, a little  <br/>\nobsession never hurt anybody.  Too much obsession, maybe so...)   <br/>\nInvite the kids, invite the spouse, the inlaws, and neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31611,"nextTopicId":31615}}
