It commemorates the <br/>\nvisit of the three wise men to Jesus.  In the persons of the Magi, who were <br/>\nnot Jews, Jesus was manifested to all the nations of the Earth.  Epiphany <br/>\nmeans &quot;manifestation&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesus wasn&#39;t baptised as a baby.  His cousin John (remember John the <br/>\nBaptist?) baptised him as an adult.  I think Theophany does refer to Jesus&#39; <br/>\nbaptism, but it didn&#39;t happen when he was a baby, and it&#39;s not the same as <br/>\nthe Epiphany. He was circumcised, as all Jewish baby boys are, when he was 8 <br/>\ndays old. Maybe that&#39;s where the confusion comes in. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Jesus was baptised he went into the desert where he fasted for forty <br/>\ndays.  Lent is the season which commemorates this event.  Ash Wednesday is <br/>\nthe first day of Lent.  The day before Ash Wednesday is Mardi Gras (Fat <br/>\nTuesday in French).  Mardi Gras is only one day long.  Carnival is a <br/>\ndifferent story. The Lenten season lasts from Ash Wednesday until midnight of <br/>\nHoly Saturday (the day before Easter).  It is 46 days long because Sundays <br/>\nare not counted when adding up the 40 days.  It seems that Lent always begins <br/>\nsometime in February.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1305,"nextTopicId":1298}}
