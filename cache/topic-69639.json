We need clarity in this list. There are people from all over the world here and lots of those who English is not their first language. |English is not my first language. I am not afraid to post. I sure try to be mindful of my words and as clear as I can. When I am not I can sure count on someone asking me to clarify and that is a good thing.<br/>\nClear ideas and words will lead you to clear thinking and when you have a clear idea of what you want and how you want your home to be and look like it will make it  easier to act and choose how to act in a way that will lead you there.<br/>\nI clearly do not  want to be the screaming mom who is  kicking stuff , screaming at my kids because I am frustrated!! I want to be able to take a deep breath and make a better choice. Once I made that decision and I have decided that screaming and being mad is not how I want to be  then I can make a better choice .<br/>\nI have not screamed in a long long time. Do not remember the last time. With my kids even raising my voice can hurt their feelings. They do not like it. My husband does not like it either.  It hurts their feelings. It would hurt mine too. Sometimes I still raise my voice but I am able to stop, take a deep breath and choose to lower my voice and calm down. <br/>\n If you need to channel  or &quot;canalizar&quot; why not channel on calming and peace?<br/>\nI have hit my older son a few times, not because I thought it was good but because I lost it and hit him. I am not proud. I am horrified. One time when he was five I hit him  and then I called  my wonderful friend Schuyler , who posts here, and she told me to just decide to stop, to never do it again.    I did just that. Instead of finding excuses in  &quot;:Oh I just lost it&quot; or &quot; I was mad and it was a mistake.&quot; I did consciously choose to never do it again and I never did.  It was not that I thought it was OK before either!   <br/>\n One can keep finding excuses to scream and shout or they can decide to make better choices. I am not perfect. Far from that but I am not looking for excuses. I have a clear picture of how I want to be as a mom and I make choices based on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":455832955,"authorName":"Genevieve Labonte","from":"Genevieve Labonte &lt;fihz07@...&gt;","profile":"fihz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Support helpful/unhelpful","postDate":"1353172028","msgId":69653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJCQ0IyMkJGLTQyMDMtNDM2OC1BNkE0LTc3MDJCRDRCRDA1OEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGs4ODVlcCs2ZzA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs4ODVlcCs2ZzA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69652,"nextInTopic":69654,"prevInTime":69652,"nextInTime":69654,"topicId":69639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Inherent in these questions seem to be doubts that my husband and I are somehow qualified as well as fear of what&#39;s not conventional and an obvious separation of life and learning. But what seems most significant is a lack of trust that children--human beings--desire to learn of their own initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven before five years of age our kids have desired to learn letters, numbers and words in addition to a million other less schoolish things. They&#39;ve asked about the meaning of words used by adults, incorporated the words and phrases for their own use and even made jokes about things that seemed illogical to them. To me the jokes seem a far more sophisticated expression of understanding than rote recitation of vocabulary definitions required by schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounting began with picking just the right number of basil leaves for sandwiches, identifying basil and at least a dozen other garden plants along the way. Our daughter pointed out once that fractions (though she called them &#39;parts&#39;) and percentages are sort of the same thing. She sings to rabbits, chickens and plants and translates her conversation with them into drawings and piano compositions. Our son, who is interested in systems and relationships, (he calls it &#39;stuff that works&#39;) one day picked up a globe to show me that the imaginary plane flight he was taking would take less time veering toward the pole rather than nearer the equator. He said top and middle, but he clearly grasped concepts about which he&#39;d never been formally taught; and he&#39;s never actually flown nor seen those charts in the seat back pocket. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting that our kids are gifted, but rather that kids--human beings--are driven to learn unless the joy of it is driven out of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey do ask for help when they need it. Sometimes they ask for help with things I know they can do independently, but we help then too. I figure it&#39;s our job, as the more experienced family members, to make sure the world is accessible and support their exploration of it. I want our kids to know it&#39;s okay to make mistakes and that we learn more from them than we do when things turn out right the first time. I want them to retain their joy in the doing, and to recognize that working harder and longer can be a pleasure when one chooses to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think about how our kids learn so seamlessly and how so many of the adults in my university classes struggle, having been taught that learning is difficult, that it&#39;s the grade or the degree that counts rather than the experience gained. Although some people survive the school experience without that baggage most do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to share that I&#39;ve learned so much here from reading of others&#39; experience and by the challenge of finding words to describe and understand my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nTori </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Support helpful/unhelpful","postDate":"1353164531","msgId":69649,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMUMzRTE4LTBBMUQtNEQ3RS04MTQwLUU3RjBCMTQ0RDRGOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs4ODVlcCs2ZzA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs4ODVlcCs2ZzA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69648,"nextInTopic":69651,"prevInTime":69648,"nextInTime":69650,"topicId":69639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Canalize ?

They need support exploring as long as their interest holds. A word here. A &quot;You might want to try this instead,&quot; there. A &quot;Thought you might find this interesting,&quot; thrown in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n* (All kids need active support, but unschooling focuses on providing it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically kids want us to trust they can figure it out themselves. They want us to trust they&#39;ll ask for help when they need it. They want to trust that we&#39;ll be there to spot them to prevent disasters. They want to trust we&#39;ll provide the emotional and physical support they need to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdults *expect* freedom to explore, *expect* no one will interfere unless they&#39;re asked for advice. If someone offers unsolicited advice, the likely reaction is irritation, even hostility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how much of that irritation is natural (biological), how much is reaction to a childhood of being told what to do and what not to do, how much is reaction to this society&#39;s worship of self-reliance. But the overwhelming message in this society is that you support people and trust them to do better. If they need help they&#39;ll ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a BUT coming. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many people are capable of figuring out how to have great relationships with their spouses and kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* they had great role models growing up, they could. But most parents are -- without realizing it -- doing a crappy job.  Often what kids experience growing up is being made to set their needs aside for others. The message is others&#39; needs are important. Others&#39; needs *for* you are important. Yours are only important if someone else thinks they&#39;re important or if they don&#39;t bother someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that a good foundation to build great relationships from? To believe everyone&#39;s needs but yours are important? To grow up wanting and wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids grow up they may shove their needs down because they&#39;ve learned their needs aren&#39;t important. Or they may figure out it&#39;s everyone for themselves: the only way to meet your needs is to put yours first ahead of everyone else&#39;s. (A few with high interpersonal intelligence do manage to figure out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when their social tools don&#39;t work with a spouse or kid, what do they do? Do they step back and reassess their whole belief system? Not likely! They usually try even harder with the tools that don&#39;t work. They hit the screw even harder with the hammer ;-) They blame the other person. They give up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;ll look to self help books. Maybe they&#39;ll hear a bit of unsolicited advice. But for the most part they&#39;re conditioned sociologically or biologically to figure it out themselves. But, unless someone has high interpersonal intelligence, if they do ever figure it out it can take *decades*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship with their spouse and kids doesn&#39;t have decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut biology and society will conspire against people from seeking out the help their need.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people will reject help unless they&#39;ve asked for it. (Which I think is mostly human nature. It&#39;s why schools don&#39;t work. You can&#39;t impose you&#39;re idea of right on someone without expecting that some people will resist.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people tie their identity with what they know. (That&#39;s a huge message picked up in school.) If you do, say, believe something wrong you&#39;re wrong and bad. (Loads of people spend their childhoods feeling wrong and in need of fixing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people who do seek help want help with their own ideas. They aren&#39;t asking to have their belief system stripped down and a new one installed. ;-) They just want the same but better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial support groups will protect one of their own if they sense &quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; in help offered. The overwhelming message is that it&#39;s better to support and trust than to potentially hurt someone by telling them they&#39;re wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Some* people can separate who they are from what they know. *Some* people can see an idea separate from the people holding that idea and understand that if you want to understand the idea quickly, it works best to clear your worktable of the old ideas and start from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people aren&#39;t. That&#39;s why this model of learning about unschooling doesn&#39;t work in every forum. It&#39;s why it will be generally greeted with hostility. It&#39;s why it&#39;s better if people come here seeking it out rather than it being imposed where people haven&#39;t asked for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to answer your question ;-) the groups aren&#39;t wrong to offer words of support. Support is their function.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT they aren&#39;t being as *helpful* as they&#39;re certain they are. Cheery words and possibly a bit of advice for people who&#39;ve hit stumbling blocks is helping them *if* they know how to change or if they don&#39;t have a deadline for learning something. Supporting people who don&#39;t know how to change, who need to change as soon as possible is not helping them. It&#39;s not helping those they&#39;re hurting. It makes being wrong feel more comfortable. To change people need to feel uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course telling the support groups they aren&#39;t being helpful would be met with defensiveness and hostility ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA good coach *does* give pep talks. But a good coach also supplies good solid information that helps someone change. Pep talks without the information on how to change is just cheerleading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes some special skills to offer help in a social support group that doesn&#39;t have that feeling of criticism that support people are so sensitive to. It takes a willingness to let slide advice you feel is harmful.  Support groups are intended to support who people are, and what they want to do, not support  a particular way of changing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* someone wants help, *if* someone goes to a coach, *if* someone is willing to let go of what&#39;s getting in their way to take on a new belief system, they&#39;ll be open to change, open to listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Support helpful/unhelpful","postDate":"1353076292","msgId":69640,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3MTEwMzY1LUQ2NjEtNEI5MC05QkI1LUFFQUJGRDlBMTE5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFRjQ0MjA5LTBBQTgtNDJFOC05MzdELTdFNUVGMUNGQzBGREBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdFRjQ0MjA5LTBBQTgtNDJFOC05MzdELTdFNUVGMUNGQzBGREBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69639,"nextInTopic":69641,"prevInTime":69639,"nextInTime":69641,"topicId":69639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Normalising these behaviours though seems to be creating a culture among parents where anything goes, as long as you reflect on it, apologise and don t be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1513334617\">-=- Normalising these behaviours though seems to be creating a culture among parents where anything goes, as long as you reflect on it, apologise and don&#39;t be hard on yourself.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a mom who killed her two teens a year or two ago.

When I had my 1st, it was magical. We spent all day together,<br/>\nlaughed, played, she became my teacher. Then, I tried to become pregnant<br/>\nagain, and had 3 misses back to back. That crushed me, and in the process<br/>\nturned me into an ogre. I began being rude and mean to my little girl,<br/>\nyelling at her when she wanted me to pick her up and I still was pregnant<br/>\n(b4 the 2nd miss occured) that I could not pick her up because.... and on I<br/>\nwent with all this reasons. The thing is that during that time, I was not<br/>\nreally myself, and was incapable of dealing with my emotions, or not<br/>\ndealing really, because I was bottling everything then erupting with her.<br/>\nMy poor baby had nothing to do with it.<br/>\nI then realized how I was treating her when she no longer was sweet to me.<br/>\nNo more huggs, kisses, no more sweetness. That crushed me, but made me<br/>\nbecome better, I then got pregnant again and although I had my fears, I<br/>\nstill picked her up and made her part of our lives again by letting her<br/>\ntalk to the baby in the belly and such. She was also a part of the birth,<br/>\nand now they are inseparable. When she was about 3/4/5, I would ask her &quot;if<br/>\nyou could change something about mommy to make her perfect what would that<br/>\nbe??? Her answer, was always &quot;the yelling&quot; you yell a lot mom, she would<br/>\nsay &quot;and it scares me&quot; with tears in her eyes...<br/>\nThe first time she answered that way, my heart melted. Ever since then, I<br/>\nhave been working non stop to try to fix it. Now she is 7, and when I ask<br/>\nher what she would change, her answer is &quot;NOTHING&quot;! And that is why<br/>\nchanging is all worth it.! I took her on a date to lunch and I said how do<br/>\nyou feel? Are you happy? And she said &quot; mom, I am the happiest kid in the<br/>\nworld, because I am so peaceful. I really feel at peace&#39;<br/>\nThat time, my heart jumped for joy! And unschooling has looots to do with<br/>\nit... so I do think you are a very good friend for stepping in, because<br/>\nyelling and throwing things around a child is NOT the way to be. I&#39;ve done<br/>\nit, and sadly regret it. Sometimes, people don&#39;t realize that children do<br/>\nlisten and learn all the time (as I)... children at their younger years<br/>\nlearn by immitation, and it is better to create an environment that is<br/>\nworth immitating. I learned it the hard way, but we are recovering (because<br/>\nthere is ALWAYS room to improve) and it has become the greatest journey...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to all of you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 16, 2012 8:02 AM, &quot;Victoria Otero&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tori.otero@...\">tori.otero@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey there<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my closest friends (who is attachment parenting and hopes to<br/>\n&gt; Unschool) and her partner are struggling at the moment to manage their<br/>\n&gt; feelings.

IMO, when you start hitting, throwing things, kicking thing, etc...  is when you cross the border and you need help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, you canalize your frustrations in another way than all this violent behavior (go jogging, putting on loud music and dancing, etc...), but you sometimes need exterior help to learn the triggers to your anger and frustration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we ARE human.  Yes, sometimes life can get challenging, especially with young children, less sleep, frustrating situations, etc... but it doesn&#39;t have to show up on them or near them.  Adults need to learn to talk to each other respectfully if they want their kids to learn to be respectful too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour friends are lucky to have you around, as you seem to be helping them a lot.  Reading the RU lists really have helped me and finding a good therapist who helped me identify my triggers before the become too big were the best moves I&#39;ve made.  I still have hard moments, but I usually find a way to canalize without the children being involved or even aware of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcusing to your children your bad behavior will help, but does not repair.  If you have an extremely rare frustration and your kids are old enough to understand the why and how, it can be OK to voice to them why you were in that frustrating moment, and that you&#39;re sorry they witnessed it, but it shouldn&#39;t be a plaster on an everyday event for a 2 yo.
