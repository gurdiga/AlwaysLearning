Sometimes they don&#39;t. Be comfortable with tears, with sorrow.<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you the number of times I&#39;ve heard people say they didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto bring up the death or loss because they &quot;might make the person cry&quot;.<br/>\nAs if not talking about it helped. What happens is the person that is <br/>\ngrieving feels isolated and cut off from their friends. Because the friends <br/>\nare uncomfortable with tears so they don&#39;t call anymore, or don&#39;t talk openly <br/>\nabout the loss.<br/>\nThe best kind of friend is fine with your tears. They know they didn&#39;t cause <br/>\nthe pain just by asking about your baby/mother/loved one.  They were simply <br/>\nwilling to not act like nothing happened and be there while you were showing <br/>\nhurt.<br/>\nDon&#39;t say sorry a hundred times, we know you feel badly already.<br/>\nDon&#39;t say &quot;ooooh&quot; with a really horrible look on your face over and over. <br/>\nCry with the person if you feel so moved. Hug them, let them know you love <br/>\nthem and will be there for them no matter what.<br/>\nBut just being a good listener is the number one thing.<br/>\nWhen you&#39;ve lost someone, it helps to talk about them sometimes, to remember <br/>\ngood things and bad. A good listener is the best kind of friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that is a really horrible way to treat a grieving person is <br/>\nthat there is a time limit on their grief. <br/>\nPeople expect you to &quot;get over it&quot; in a certain amount of time and if you are <br/>\nstill heavy into grief that isn&#39;t acceptable.<br/>\nHelping people understand the nature of grief can help.<br/>\nThe grieving process isn&#39;t what we go through to &quot;get over&quot; anything. It&#39;s <br/>\nsimply a way to put the person we love into a new type of relationship with <br/>\nus.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t quit having a relationship with someone just because they are gone.<br/>\nThey are in your heart and mind forever and what you have to do is adjust to <br/>\ntheir not being present in your life physically. Which is the most painful <br/>\nand difficult thing we can ever do I believe.<br/>\nYou never get over losing someone. It leaves a gap in your life forever. An <br/>\nemptiness that no one else can fill.<br/>\nTime does heal certain amounts of pain. Going through the grieving process <br/>\nhelps us accept and feel all the emotions connected to loss and death.<br/>\nBut there is no time limit on this process, there is no linear path through <br/>\nthe grieving process and it is a very different path for every person.<br/>\nSome people are going to do things very differently than others, and to try <br/>\nand understand and support them instead of telling them how to handle their <br/>\ngrief is very helpful.<br/>\nIf they still break down crying in a year, that&#39;s OK!<br/>\nYou might ask them if they&#39;ve considered counseling, but no one needs to hear <br/>\nthat they &quot;should&quot; have it.<br/>\nMaybe crying is exactly what they need and they&#39;re feeling very capable of <br/>\nhandling their grief without outside support.<br/>\nUsually, if a family unit is very open and able to talk about death and the <br/>\nloved one, that is the most important support. Especially for children.<br/>\nWithout that, a person may need a group support situation or private <br/>\ncounseling.<br/>\nIf you want more info. email me, I don&#39;t want to get the list too clogged up <br/>\nwith grief advice. :)<br/>\nI have a lot of info. on supporting children through the process, since <br/>\nthat&#39;s who I worked with (pre-teens) in the program.
