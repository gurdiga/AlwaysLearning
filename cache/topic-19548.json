They&#39;re almost as scary as the terrorist ones in some <br/>\nways --<br/>\nand they definitely have some traits in common with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first moved to Charlotte, the houses next to us, behind us,<br/>\nand diagonally across the street all contained children who <br/>\nmysteriously<br/>\nnever seemed to leave home, and mothers with glazed expressions on <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nfaces. The whole set-up of moms stuck with their school-age kids <br/>\n24/7 gave<br/>\nme the willies, and that was before I even had one of my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle class areas seem to be magnets for little suburban<br/>\nschoolhouses. Even though there must be homeschooling pockets all <br/>\nover<br/>\nCharlotte, somehow I don&#39;t picture your basic Ballantyne babe risking<br/>\nbreaking a nail on a chalkboard in the bonus room, or skipping a <br/>\ntennis set<br/>\nfor an educational excursion to the sewage plant. Likewise, I doubt <br/>\nmany<br/>\nBelmont moms miss a beat packing those kids off to public school. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the<br/>\nmiddle class that gets suckered into the myth that mothers and older<br/>\nchildren can survive being together all day without somebody being<br/>\nstrangled. The true &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; know better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s scary is that a lot of the homeschooling faithful are as <br/>\nfueled<br/>\nby a fanatical, religion-based belief in their mission as Islamist<br/>\nterrorists, and seem to be just about as brainwashed. Sometimes I <br/>\neven<br/>\nwonder if they&#39;re a manufactured race along the lines of the <br/>\nStepford wives<br/>\nin Ira Levin&#39;s book, but assembled in fundamentalist Christian <br/>\nchurches<br/>\ninstead of family basements. Like the Stepford robots, they&#39;re <br/>\nprogrammed to<br/>\nfulfill their husbands&#39; fantasies, only in this case it&#39;s their role <br/>\nas the<br/>\nUltimate Selfless Mothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times I feel like the heroine in another famous horror story by<br/>\nLevin, Rosemary&#39;s Baby, at that chilling moment when she puts <br/>\ntogether the<br/>\nanagram &quot;All of Them Witches&quot; and realizes it refers to her seemingly<br/>\nharmless neighbors. Some of the homeschooling moms (HMs) are kind of<br/>\nwitch-y, with the uncut hair and the long skirts because pants on <br/>\nfemales<br/>\nare unholy, but the description that really applies to this coven <br/>\nis &quot;All of<br/>\nThem Zealots.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re not only terrorist-like in their conviction that their <br/>\ncalling<br/>\nis divinely ordained, homeschoolers also often have a broad martyr <br/>\nstreak.<br/>\nRather than suicide bombings, though, they commit &quot;suicide book-<br/>\nlearning,&quot;<br/>\nsacrificing their own lives to teach their kids. I&#39;ve known one or <br/>\ntwo to<br/>\nget pregnant as an excuse to get out of homeschooling hell, but the <br/>\ntrue<br/>\nmartyrs keep right on instructing, with the newest little pupil <br/>\nglued to<br/>\ntheir breast.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond a certain age, children and mothers are just not meant to be<br/>\nisolated together. It&#39;s unnatural. Keeping the kids at home might <br/>\nhave<br/>\nworked back in the Stone Age, but cave women would&#39;ve at least had <br/>\neach<br/>\nother for company, and I bet they made damn sure the youngsters <br/>\nstayed off<br/>\nin a group together while they grunted gossip and drank their Cro-<br/>\nMagnon<br/>\ncoffee.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids need their teachers to be adults, separate from their mothers.<br/>\nThat way they can idolize or despise them apart from a parent <br/>\nfigure, and<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to depend on one person for everything they require. Did <br/>\na parent<br/>\nof yours try to teach you to drive? How&#39;d that go? &#39;Nuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll young animals must be immersed in a mass of their peers so they<br/>\ncan figure out what it means to function as a member of the larger <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\nBelieve me, I&#39;m aware that homeschooling families get their children<br/>\ntogether, since occasionally there&#39;ll be a flood of them from next <br/>\ndoor<br/>\nscrambling over the fence to play uninvited in our yard, but being <br/>\nwith<br/>\nmaybe a dozen other kids once in a while doesn&#39;t do the trick. It <br/>\ntakes<br/>\nserious numbers for developing humans to catch on to the nuances of <br/>\naccepted<br/>\nbehavior and to have a chance to make enough friends. I just can&#39;t <br/>\nsee<br/>\nhomeschooling providing adequate socialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my neighboring HMs taught her two kids through eighth grade,<br/>\nthen threw them to the wolves in public high school. The boy ended up<br/>\ndropping out and doing jail time, and the girl got pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know that homeschooled kids have won high-profile academic<br/>\ncontests, but for every homeschooler who aces a spelling bee, <br/>\nthere&#39;s some<br/>\npoor child being &quot;instructed&quot; by a parent who&#39;s barely literate <br/>\nherself.<br/>\nTeachers in the public school system are required to have <br/>\ncertification and<br/>\ncollege degrees, yet any yahoo can force their kids to stay home as <br/>\nlong as<br/>\nthey pass an annual test.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really scary about homeschooling is what it can do to the<br/>\nsanity of a mother deluded into thinking it&#39;s her Christian duty. No <br/>\nwoman<br/>\nwas ever meant to be trapped in a house all day with children old <br/>\nenough to<br/>\nspell &quot;homicide.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if new neighbors move in next door and you notice that the kids<br/>\nnever leave for school and mom wears her hair in two braids, be <br/>\nafraid. Be<br/>\nvery afraid.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19538,"nextTopicId":19558}}
