All those things are justifiable as unschooling expenses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe on his birthday, if you can&#39;t afford another gift, you could take photos of the cool things he knows how to do with that, and make a blog post or a photo album on facebook or something, saying happy birthday and showing him in many happy poses. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I need help thinking through whether their is any benefit in asking him to wait till his actual birthday, that there is some point to helping him try different techniques to learn to cope with delayed gratification.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law wasn&#39;t a very nice person. When we had two little boys, who were about 2 and 5, she told me once when she thought I was being too nice to them, &quot;You need to frustrate them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNO, I did NOT need to frustrate them.  There are many natural frustrations in life.  Mean grandmothers are among them.  But to *create* frustration to practice is as cruel as breaking a child&#39;s finger so that he will be better prepared in case he ever breaks an arm or a leg.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are great at delayed gratification, all of them. They have saved money, earned money, bought small things, and large things, waited for friends to visit, waited for holidays and parties, and because they&#39;re busy and secure people, they could always find something to do.  But they were also generally sure that as soon as it WAS possible, they would do it, or have it.   That&#39;s because they had lived their lives with parents who were their partners and who helped them, rather than thwarted or frustrated them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids get to 18 and they&#39;re sick and tired of waiting, and they don&#39;t want to wait anymore for ANYthing.  Some turn to drugs, drinking, partying, charge cards, driving too fast...     When parents have a choice of saying yes or no, and they choose &quot;no&quot; because they think it&#39;s good for their child, they are putting that pressure and tension in the bank to gain interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSay yes when you can, especially if it&#39;s about something that will help your child learn.  If you can&#39;t decide, think &quot;Will he be happy and learn?  Will this help with unschooling?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":176090712,"authorName":"am_y72","from":"&quot;am_y72&quot; &lt;am_y72@...&gt;","profile":"am_y72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Giving birthday presents before birthdays","postDate":"1357671726","msgId":70244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtjaHFmZStpbnFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70243,"nextInTopic":70246,"prevInTime":70243,"nextInTime":70245,"topicId":70240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Joyce, he pointed out the difference earlier, it s not in the post it s on top of the cupboard!
