She was so <br/>\nNON academic all of her life.  I really thought the getting up early <br/>\nwould get to her.  She LOVES having a place to go to everyday where <br/>\nshe can express herself in fashion, so that makes it worth it to her.  <br/>\nShe loves the interpersonal dynamics that happen all day long there, <br/>\nwith other kids and the adults in the system.<br/>\nShe decided after the first week that she would probably stay and that <br/>\nshe wanted to get good grades if she was going to do this.<br/>\nI told her &quot;Okay, but you better not make the honor roll, cause I&#39;m <br/>\nNOT going to put one of those &quot;My child made the honor roll at.....&quot; <br/>\nbumper stickers on my car.  When she actually did make it (which was <br/>\nnot a goal for her) she told all her friends that she was going to be <br/>\nin big trouble. :-)<br/>\nAnyone who unschools can probably imagine that we are not sitting here <br/>\nimplying to her that these grades make her something better than what <br/>\nshe was before she went to school.  If we gave her any indication of <br/>\nthat, she would put us in our places quickly.  She would find that <br/>\ninsulting, coming from us.  She&#39;ll take the $100 that Pop Pop gave her <br/>\nfor it though ;-).  She has come away with an idea that grades are <br/>\ndefinetly a product of playing the school game not a indication of <br/>\nintelligence.  <br/>\nShe thinks a lot about what is going on and we talk a lot about all of <br/>\nit.   She&#39;s not an unschooler anymore, but I still am (and am still <br/>\nunschooling with her younger siblings) and our relationship and my <br/>\nparenting is still heavily influenced by that philosophy.<br/>\nThe grades do make it easier for me to say &quot;See! :-p, I knew what I <br/>\nwas doing.&quot;  But, if she hadn&#39;t done as well, or had left, it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\naffect our thoughts on unschooling.

The first week he was enrolled they wanted to give him placement tests -- I was hesistant about this, but he went ahead and did the testing.  The end result?  The school was absolutely amazed...he was in 6th grade, but placed in 12++grade for math (his favorite) and his science.  Social studies was very high too, and reading/spelling was about 10th grade level.  What was so great is that he decided to stop attending the school within a week or two.  While he was only unschooled for about a year, that placement test gave him the satisfaction that he was still learning at home, without textbooks, structure, etc.  We have continued unschooling and I LOVE it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if my kids fit public school standards, BUT if I have something that gives a great comparison on unschooling vs. public school, I do love to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooler going back to school","postDate":"1112391303","msgId":21934,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkYS4zOTY3NTFhYi4yZjdmMTg4N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21933,"nextInTopic":21935,"prevInTime":21933,"nextInTime":21935,"topicId":21914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/1/2005 2:13:33 PM Mountain Standard Time, kltronoff1@juno.com writes: If I say  that I don t think that grades are important then how do I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1964953695\">In a message dated 4/1/2005 2:13:33 PM Mountain Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kltronoff1@...\">kltronoff1@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say  that I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat grades are important then how do I support her in  this journey when<br/>\nthat is what everyone will be focusing  on? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==============<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice_\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice)\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s how my sister did it.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":81109964,"authorName":"kltronoff1@juno.com","from":"kltronoff1@...","profile":"kltronoff1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooler going back to school","postDate":"1112390681","msgId":21933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDAxLjEzMjQ0Mi4yNzYwLjIua2x0cm9ub2ZmMUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21932,"nextInTopic":21934,"prevInTime":21932,"nextInTime":21934,"topicId":21914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh!
