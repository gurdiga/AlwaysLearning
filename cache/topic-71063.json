She knew most of her letters and sounds and was very interested in trying. It didn&#39;t happen though. Her brain wasn&#39;t ready yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 6, I thought she was close and she was skills-wise, but time-wise it&#39;s been a year since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never done a &quot;reading lesson.&quot; We have never done a curriculum or workbooks. There has never been a single tear over trying to read and I&#39;ve never pushed her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read many books to her since she was a baby. We&#39;ve paid attention to the words in our lives- on signs, cereal boxes, labels, video games and everywhere else. She&#39;s played starfall. I&#39;ve told her the sounds of letters as she has been interested. We&#39;ve played with magnet letters and banana grams. She&#39;s played with a few workbooks, and when I say played I really mean just that. The workbooks sit with the coloring books in our house and are treated the same way- use them if and when you want, put them away when you are done. We&#39;ve played a reading flash card game the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve never once sat down with her and said or implied, &quot;Now it&#39;s time to try to learn to read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago, she read The Foot Book and half of another book that was at the doctor&#39;s office and I don&#39;t remember the name of it. Some of The Foot Book was memorized, but she also sounded out a lot of words and started picking up on some sight words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she didn&#39;t do anything reading related for weeks, which is typical. She often has a big interest in something, then drops it for weeks or months, then picks it up again with sudden, new skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, she was looking for The Foot Book and we couldn&#39;t find it. Today, I found it and handed it to her. She read it and then asked for more books to read. I pulled out Green Eggs and Ham and she read the whole thing. I helped her with a few words that couldn&#39;t be sounded out and she didn&#39;t know from sight, but other than that, she figured it out on her own while I just sat with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer reading was interspersed every few sentences with, &quot;Mom! I&#39;m reading! Hehe! Yay! I&#39;m reading! Hey you know what&#39;s more fun than watching tv? Me learning to read!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(And on that note, we don&#39;t restrict tv watching and she could have chosen to do that instead with no pressure to do otherwise. Her sister was actually watching a movie in the same room the whole time she was reading the book. She chose to read). <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71050,"nextTopicId":71062}}
