Aurora, almost 1. None of them have<br/>\neven so much as set foot in a school, and when I asked Rowan if he was<br/>\ninterested, the other day, he flat-out laughed at me. So far so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my problem. I&#39;m still catching myself being all happy when something<br/>\nthat I identify as schoolish benchmarks and accomplishments pops up. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t do spelling exercises or workbooks or anything; Rowan wants to spell<br/>\nstuff so he can find things on the internet, or contribute his input to the<br/>\ngrocery list. And yet I am all giddy in my heart-of-schoolish-darkness that<br/>\nhe&#39;s *spelling*. He does amazing math in his head, when he&#39;s doing<br/>\nconstruction projects with his father, and I&#39;m all stoked because in my<br/>\nbrain I know that that&#39;s math I didn&#39;t do until 4th or 5th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m wondering when schoolishness gets eradicated from my thoughts?
