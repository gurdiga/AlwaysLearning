My daughter frequently gets quite angry at him when she percieves <br/>\nhim doing something &#39;wrong&#39;, which to her means not the way she pictured it <br/>\nin her mind, and then my husband gets quite upset and feels she is being <br/>\nungrateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example is that today I bought some melting chocolate for my daughter, <br/>\nand she wanted to melt it in her toy saucepans.  Her dad explained that we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t put the saucepans in the microwave (nor are they designed to be <br/>\nused on the stove, they&#39;re toys), but we could heat it in a bowl, then pour <br/>\nit into the saucepan.  My daughter said that would work, so dad started <br/>\nheating the chocolate in the microwave.  He took the chocolate out to stir <br/>\nit part way through, and my daughter got upset that he was stirring it <br/>\nbecause she wanted to.  Dad was concerned that it would be too hot for her <br/>\n(the bowl itself gets painfully hot when heating).  He poured it into her <br/>\nlittle saucepan, and she stirred it there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she poured it into her toy cake pan, but there wasn&#39;t enough, so dad <br/>\noffered to melt some more, and asked how much.  Daughter said she would like <br/>\ntwo of each colour, but dad said that probably wouldn&#39;t be enough.  Then he <br/>\nasked her if she wanted to use some of the chocolate pieces that had started <br/>\nto melt (in the sun), and she totally lost it, screaming that he&#39;d ruined <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband went off into the other room, and my daughter did eventually calm <br/>\ndown.  I could point out to him a few points where he could have done things <br/>\ndifferently (accepting that she only wanted two of each piece of chocolate <br/>\nfor example), and I explained to my daughter that if she wants to do <br/>\nsomething a particular way, she needs to ask, not scream.  But other than <br/>\nthat, I&#39;m not sure how I can help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is usually OK about it after a few moments, it&#39;s really my <br/>\nhusband who&#39;s struggling.  He came from a very strict background, where he <br/>\nwas expected to say thanks for something and appreciate it even if it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwhat he wanted, and where what his parents said went, regardless of his own <br/>\nopinions, so I think this is impacting on it.  He frequently says &#39;she&#39;s not <br/>\neven grateful for what I&#39;m doing&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really impacting on him, to the point where he has said that he would <br/>\nrather not be here many days.  Some of this is his own issues (he suffers <br/>\nfrom depression and anxiety, and has a very low self esteem), but the way my <br/>\ndaughter screams at him so frequently (at least once or twice most days) <br/>\nisn&#39;t helping.  I find myself being harsher on her than I feel I should be <br/>\nsimply to stop her screaming at my husband, who is obviously very <br/>\ndistressed.  I&#39;m not really sure what else I can do.  I don&#39;t want to send <br/>\nmy daughter to school, though that would give my husband a break from her <br/>\nconstant presence (we both work from home).  I do try to take her out a <br/>\ncouple of times a week so that my husband can have some quiet time, and she <br/>\ncan play with her friends, but lately she hasn&#39;t wanted to go anywhere, and <br/>\nplaydates with her friends have ended similarly, with her yelling at them <br/>\nand wanting to go home, saying she never wants to visit again.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone see any obvious flaws in how I&#39;m handling it, and anything I <br/>\ncould be doing differently.  Any great pages that I could suggest my husband <br/>\nread?  He&#39;s very open to unschooling, and completely on board with it, but <br/>\nhe is struggling more with the actual implementation than I am, possibly <br/>\nbecause he has less time to read as much as I have read.  It has taken me so <br/>\nlong to get to the point where I have a better relationship with my <br/>\ndaughter, and I want to help him find ways that work for him too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":450634826,"authorName":"Kristen","from":"&quot;Kristen&quot; &lt;goldfish_add@...&gt;","profile":"goldfish_add","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Helping my Husband and Daughter get along better","postDate":"1323768988","msgId":64371,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjNzZhcytlNWRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUwNDI1OUQ2RTNCNTRGMjY4Q0UwQkY2NDA3QkEzNjdCQFRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":64370,"nextInTopic":64372,"prevInTime":64370,"nextInTime":64372,"topicId":64364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tamara- How old is your daughter? -Kristen","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-927244846\">Tamara-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your daughter?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333388203,"authorName":"Rinelle","from":"&quot;Rinelle&quot; &lt;rinelle@...&gt;","profile":"rinelle2011","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Helping my Husband and Daughter get along better","postDate":"1323762354","msgId":64369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUwNDI1OUQ2RTNCNTRGMjY4Q0UwQkY2NDA3QkEzNjdCQFRhbWFyYT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT2V1M0FpNG5SN1kwblNQRm5qUUhQR1YrVnV6RzYyYk8wZ1JiRXliOGhWRGZWY3dIZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpjNXYxOStpdGY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FPZXUzQWk0blI3WTBuU1BGbmpRSFBHVitWdXpHNjJiTzBnUmJFeWI4aFZEZlZjd0hnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64368,"nextInTopic":64370,"prevInTime":64368,"nextInTime":64370,"topicId":64364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband and daugther seem to be really struggling with getting along lately.

Her dad explained that we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t put the saucepans in the microwave (nor are they designed to be <br/>\nused on the stove, they&#39;re toys), but we could heat it in a bowl, then pour <br/>\nit into the saucepan.  My daughter said that would work, so dad started <br/>\nheating the chocolate in the microwave.  He took the chocolate out to stir <br/>\nit part way through, and my daughter got upset that he was stirring it <br/>\nbecause she wanted to.  Dad was concerned that it would be too hot for her <br/>\n(the bowl itself gets painfully hot when heating).  He poured it into her <br/>\nlittle saucepan, and she stirred it there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she poured it into her toy cake pan, but there wasn&#39;t enough, so dad <br/>\noffered to melt some more, and asked how much.  Daughter said she would like <br/>\ntwo of each colour, but dad said that probably wouldn&#39;t be enough.  Then he <br/>\nasked her if she wanted to use some of the chocolate pieces that had started <br/>\nto melt (in the sun), and she totally lost it, screaming that he&#39;d ruined <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband went off into the other room, and my daughter did eventually calm <br/>\ndown.  I could point out to him a few points where he could have done things <br/>\ndifferently (accepting that she only wanted two of each piece of chocolate <br/>\nfor example), and I explained to my daughter that if she wants to do <br/>\nsomething a particular way, she needs to ask, not scream.  But other than <br/>\nthat, I&#39;m not sure how I can help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is usually OK about it after a few moments, it&#39;s really my <br/>\nhusband who&#39;s struggling.  He came from a very strict background, where he <br/>\nwas expected to say thanks for something and appreciate it even if it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwhat he wanted, and where what his parents said went, regardless of his own <br/>\nopinions, so I think this is impacting on it.  He frequently says &#39;she&#39;s not <br/>\neven grateful for what I&#39;m doing&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really impacting on him, to the point where he has said that he would <br/>\nrather not be here many days.  Some of this is his own issues (he suffers <br/>\nfrom depression and anxiety, and has a very low self esteem), but the way my <br/>\ndaughter screams at him so frequently (at least once or twice most days) <br/>\nisn&#39;t helping.  I find myself being harsher on her than I feel I should be <br/>\nsimply to stop her screaming at my husband, who is obviously very <br/>\ndistressed.  I&#39;m not really sure what else I can do.  I don&#39;t want to send <br/>\nmy daughter to school, though that would give my husband a break from her <br/>\nconstant presence (we both work from home).  I do try to take her out a <br/>\ncouple of times a week so that my husband can have some quiet time, and she <br/>\ncan play with her friends, but lately she hasn&#39;t wanted to go anywhere, and <br/>\nplaydates with her friends have ended similarly, with her yelling at them <br/>\nand wanting to go home, saying she never wants to visit again.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone see any obvious flaws in how I&#39;m handling it, and anything I <br/>\ncould be doing differently.  Any great pages that I could suggest my husband <br/>\nread?  He&#39;s very open to unschooling, and completely on board with it, but <br/>\nhe is struggling more with the actual implementation than I am, possibly <br/>\nbecause he has less time to read as much as I have read.  It has taken me so <br/>\nlong to get to the point where I have a better relationship with my <br/>\ndaughter, and I want to help him find ways that work for him too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336246301,"authorName":"NCMama","from":"&quot;NCMama&quot; &lt;dharmamama1@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Auto punishment","postDate":"1323740504","msgId":64367,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjNmFnbytjbnBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjNXYxOStpdGY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64366,"nextInTopic":64368,"prevInTime":64366,"nextInTime":64368,"topicId":64364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=-=Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be patient enough and distract him into forgetting about it, I think he is just looking for love","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-847163153\">=-=Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be patient enough and distract him into forgetting about it, I think he is just looking for love and reassurance even when he misbehaves=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you consider misbehavior?

They step from, I believe, a very traumatic birth experience and<br/>\nwere followed by a couple of years in daycare while I worked full time<br/>\noutside of the home. I&#39;ve been in the home with her full time for over a<br/>\nyear (and was working only part time for the year prior to that) and still<br/>\nthe separation anxiety crops up, and we continue to work through it with me<br/>\nmaking sure I am available and present and give her my full attention<br/>\nduring the day when it is just her and I. (This sounds intense, but as she<br/>\ngets filled up she will often go and play on her own, and I get to do fun<br/>\nthings like the dishes and laundry ;). My daughter is now four and half<br/>\nyears old.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m giving you that background because when my girl gets very upset she<br/>\nwill often yell that she wants to be left alone. The reality is, she both<br/>\nwants to be left alone (as in have me shut up ;) and she wants me near. If<br/>\nI calmly, kindly, say, &quot;I understand you want a little space, I&#39;m going<br/>\ninto the next room for one minute and then I&#39;ll come and check on you&quot; she<br/>\npanics - her separation anxiety is triggered and everything is suddenly<br/>\nabout me not leaving as opposed to her figuring out her emotions by getting<br/>\nsome space to that. It&#39;s not a good situation. What I have recently started<br/>\ndoing instead is simply saying &quot;I understand you want some space right now.<br/>\nI&#39;m going to step over here/sit over here and quietly wait while you have<br/>\nsome space and quiet&quot;. I don&#39;t leave the room. I literally step a foot or<br/>\ntwo away and I keep my mouth shut so she can have the peace and quiet to<br/>\nfind her own center again.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could be right that your child doesn&#39;t want to truly be left alone, and<br/>\nyou could be wrong. I&#39;ve found that giving just a little physical space and<br/>\nshutting my mouth helps my girl both sort out the emotions of the moment<br/>\nand NOT trigger the panic of separation anxiety for her.<br/>\n<br/>\ngwynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Auto punishment","postDate":"1323737392","msgId":64366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjM3MzczOTIuMzM4My5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIyNTA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjNXYxOStpdGY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpjNXYxOStpdGY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64365,"nextInTopic":64367,"prevInTime":64365,"nextInTime":64367,"topicId":64364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be patient enough and distract him into forgetting about it, I think he is just looking for love","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1660112017\">***Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be patient enough and distract him into forgetting about it, I think he is just looking for love and reassurance even when he misbehaves, but other times he punishes himself, which is very difficult for me to watch because any attempt from my side to get closer just make things worse, but I feel that if I ignore him (which is what he wants) is giving up on him or proving him right.
