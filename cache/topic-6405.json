I usually have very little time to read my email.  Usually I<br/>\nget two email digests from AlwayLearning with anywhere from 25 to 50<br/>\nmessages.  This morning, Arpil 24th, I got one with only 16 messages, of<br/>\nwhich 9 of the subject lines read, re: Digest Number ###.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my limited time, I generally don&#39;t real every message, just the<br/>\ntopics that interest me.  If a large portion of the topics say re: Digest<br/>\nNumber ###, then unless there is a topic or two I am really interested in,<br/>\nthen I will just delete the entire email.  It also makes it difficult for<br/>\nme to follow a topic as I will skip to the related messages to keep a<br/>\ntopic line flowing.  This helps me remember, understand, follow, etc the<br/>\nflow of the topic.  Lately, there has been a dramatic increase in people<br/>\nnot putting in the subject line what they are posting their discussion<br/>\nabout.  I will also just skip reading these posts because I just don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to break my train of though to figure out if the post is about a<br/>\ntopic I am interested in, and if it is, if it is a topic a am currently<br/>\nreading about.  So, if you are trying to post some information for<br/>\neveryones benefit, then it is probably not coming to my attention.  Thus,<br/>\nI am posting this message.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not telling anyone that they have to put an appropriate title in the<br/>\nsubject line.  I am just asking, if it is not too much trouble and you<br/>\nhappen to remember, could you please try to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
