So dealing with the need to pee<br/>\nis an issue for older gamers, and not just young kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought our son a laptop for gaming, and a year ago he sometimes took it<br/>\ninto the bathroom with him to Skype or game. Now he types &quot;BYB&quot; (be right<br/>\nback) in chat, or tells his buddies, over Skype, that he&#39;s taking a<br/>\nbathroom break and he&#39;ll be back in a minute or two. Learning to type BYB<br/>\nor AFK (away from keyboard) or a combination of the two (AFK - BYB) may<br/>\nhelp some kids leave a game briefly to pee. It seems to have helped my son,<br/>\nand I&#39;ve noticed his friends use it a lot, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64991,"nextTopicId":64896}}
