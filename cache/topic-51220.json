They just learn by doing & doing again. So, I&#39;ll get that word out of my vocabulary. :) lol.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMath & History: I only called it math & history for the sake of the reader. The girls & I just went to do what they wanted. <br/>\n  <br/>\nThe bank trip: my daughter wanted to do the matching game & I just thought it would be more fun to go than researching online. The girls agreed. We just withdrew from an online school & want to get out of the house to be free from this ol&#39; ball & chain style of living on the internet. We just withdrew the money & went to the car to do our activities. Then put it back. Yes, we do go to the bank for normal reasons, but it just seemed like a fun thing to do. They really loved hanging out with the $186.91 & even got to keep a quarter each for a gumball. They were happy.   <br/>\n <br/>\nThe girls & I all worked together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said, &quot;Whatever skills are needed for the position will be  <br/>\naddressed as needed&quot;. I just meant that they&#39;d be learned on the job. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing so new, I wasn&#39;t sure if I should post a response this morning but wasn&#39;t sure if someone else would & I wanted her to feel encouraged, so I did. I have been reading a lot & have a lot of questions too, but I usually refrain from asking them because I figure I&#39;ll get the answers as I learn more about it. We only know one unschooling family in the area & we&#39;ve never met in person, only via a meetup group online. I feel like the lone ranger here at times & can&#39;t wait to meet up with others in person. <br/>\nI have to admit, I feel like I spent some time under a microscope today when I was just trying to be helpful. However, I&#39;m also aware that you&#39;re just guiding & directing as necessary to help as well. So, in the future, I&#39;ll do my best to only post what I&#39;m sure to be good advice regarding unschooling. :) <br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\nLinnea.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-.

School & Education doesn&#39;t qualify us for anything really....I know very little about being a postal worker, park ranger, store manager, seamstress, painter, gardening, etc, etc. No matter what field of work or career we choose, we usually learn about it just prior to doing it. Whatever skills are needed for the position will be addressed as needed. I hope I&#39;ve been able to encourage you. :) Oh yea, by allowing her to focus on her strengths & areas of interest will greatly enable her to become the beautiful genius that she naturally is. :) No one knows everything & we&#39;re all behind in some areas. <br/>\nHave a blessed day.<br/>\nLinnea.<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Katherinev&quot; &lt;kvonduyke@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling but I am new to unschooling.
