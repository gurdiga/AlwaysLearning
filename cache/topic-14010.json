There is even a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-786835615\">Here&#39;s a little snippet from one site out of MANY that cite research <br/>\ndiscussing the link between multiple sex partners and health problems.<br/>\nThere is even a recent study that pointed to increased prostate cancer in men <br/>\nthat have multiple sex partners, although that one is less conclusive.<br/>\nThere was a lot of information linking many different problems, not just <br/>\ncervical cancer, to the multiple sex partners and also a link to early sex <br/>\n(before age 18). I don&#39;t know how they separate the two though, need to read <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRisk Factors of Cervical Cancer<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers have identified certain risk factors that increase the chance <br/>\nthat cells in the cervix will become abnormal or cancerous. They believe <br/>\nthat, in many cases, cervical cancer develops when two or more risk factors <br/>\nact together.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch has shown that women who began having sexual intercourse before age <br/>\n18 and women who have had many sexual partners have an increased risk of <br/>\ndeveloping cervical cancer. Women also are at increased risk if their <br/>\npartners began having sexual intercourse at a young age, have had many sexual <br/>\npartners, or were previously married to women who had cervical cancer (high <br/>\nrisk ?).<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch suggests that some sexually transmitted viruses (Human Papilloma <br/>\nVirus) can cause cells in the cervix to begin the series of changes that can <br/>\nlead to cancer. Women who have had many sexual partners or whose partners <br/>\nhave had many sexual partners may have an increased risk for cervical cancer <br/>\nat least in part because they are more likely to be exposed to the HPV. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmoking also increases the risk of cancer of the cervix. The risk appears to <br/>\nincrease with the number of cigarettes a woman smokes each day and with the <br/>\nnumber of years she has smoked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral reports suggest that women whose immune systems are weakened are more <br/>\nlikely than others to develop cervical cancer. For example, women who have <br/>\nthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, are at increased <br/>\nrisk. Also, organ transplant patients, who receive drugs that suppress the <br/>\nimmune system to prevent rejection of the new organ, are more likely than <br/>\nothers to develop precancerous lesions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome researchers believe that there is an increased risk of cervical cancer <br/>\nin women who use oral contraceptives (the pill). However, scientists have not <br/>\nfound that the pill directly causes cancer of the cervix. This relationship <br/>\nis hard to prove because the two main risk factors for cervical <br/>\ncancer--intercourse at an early age and multiple sex partners--may be more <br/>\ncommon among women who use the pill than among those who do not. Still, oral <br/>\ncontraceptive labels warn of this possible risk and advise women who use them <br/>\nto have yearly Pap tests.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>\nspoon;<br/>\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>\nmoon.&quot;<br/>\n                                                --The Owl and the Pussycat      <br/>\n                                        Edward Lear</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Leaving children alone","postDate":"1051852005","msgId":14045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3LjNmNDU1NzBjLjJiZTM1NmU1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14044,"nextInTopic":14046,"prevInTime":14044,"nextInTime":14046,"topicId":14010,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/03 11:25:40 PM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1931396723\">In a message dated 5/1/03 11:25:40 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think there were studies tying early and frequent partners to diseases<br/>\n (cervical cancer???) later in life. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read about some of these studies and some have held up very well.<br/>\nThe idea that our bodies get used to certain bacteria and learn how to deal <br/>\nwith it is fairly common knowledge.<br/>\nBabies are more immune to the type of bacteria that are in their own homes <br/>\nand more susceptable in others.<br/>\nSexual partners carry their own bacteria.
