AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling. Now neither seems like a specialized list anymore. So with five or six lists where there used to be the AOL boards and then UnschoolingDiscussi on, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once did, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on another.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I&#39;m no longer active at AU, but remember that it grew out of a time when parents of kids younger than traditional school-age wanted to find support for the unschooling lifestyle (mindful or consensual parenting), only to be told that &quot;if your kids aren&#39;t yet school-age, then you&#39;re not unschooling -- it&#39;s about parenting.&quot;  So, Danielle started a group to speak to those parents of very young children who planned to unschool when their kids reached school age and wanted to be already living an unschooling life. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Shine is a different list from the others, and I remain active there.  It tends to be a gentler approach for those folks who feel a need for that.  Still, no one recommends that unschooling a child is &#39;anything goes&#39; and to hell with other people&#39;s rights to be safe vs. a child&#39;s &#39;right&#39; to explore the entire world all the time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  All that aside, I think it is fair to say the message has become diluted.  I&#39;m not sure how it happened, or how to return to a saner place, but I do see instances where &#39;unschooled&#39; appears to be an excuse to allow a child to be rude, unkind and abusive to others, and I have seen some instances where a child has to go far beyond the pale to get a parent&#39;s attention.  I think those are likely parents who would be absent even if their child was in school, so unschooling is no different for them.  Except that it lets them think they&#39;re giving their child some grand adventure.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nI think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who have unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all young, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm philosophy and practice. It is possible--I&#39; m guessing somewhat--that lists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about *how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\nI agree. It&#39;s even better if the more experienced parents find a way to present what they do as mindful parenting -- as part of an unschooling philosophy  -- in a way that doesn&#39;t result in parents of very young kids feeling they shouldn&#39;t be there, because they&#39;re not yet unschooling (since the kids are &#39;too young&#39;).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.

They consider it letting the children be themselves and express whatever emotion they&#39;re having at the time. They seem to think that any sort of behavior modification or suppression is abusive. They don&#39;t believe in saying no, ever, in any circumstances. The child is allowed to do whatever he/she wants at any time, otherwise you&#39;re interferring with their development. Most of the people I&#39;ve met that have this philosophy call themselves radical unschoolers. This of course is a generalization, but I&#39;ve met far too many people like this. <br/>\n  When I do come across people like this and they try to align themselves with me as being a &#39;fellow unschooler&#39;, I quickly let them know that&#39;s not my interpretation of unschooling (and explain what unschooling is and isn&#39;t to me). Unfortunately, the kids I&#39;ve known that have grown up in that kind of environment have turned out to be rather obnoxious bullies. Rudeness, violence or disrespect to other humans has never been okay behavior in our family. Tamzin is appalled by some of the kids we&#39;ve met that claim to be radical unschoolers, and certainly doesn&#39;t want to hang out with them. We model respect in our home with ALL our family members, adults and kids alike - no one is exempt from that. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I can create what I can imagine. ~ Charlene Kingston <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.

They exaggerate their actions and their freedom. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a dishonesty about it all, and they don&#39;t act as calmly and <br/>\nrationally as those kids who are used to acting the same way when <br/>\ntheir parents aren&#39;t there as when they are. I&#39;m talking about <br/>\nteens now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never said unschooling was easy. I&#39;ve never stopped trying, <br/>\ndaily, to help people understand it. Because some people think I&#39;m <br/>\nabrasive (those who haven&#39;t heard me speak or don&#39;t know me, who <br/>\ndon&#39;t know my tone of voice), the UnschoolingBasics list was created <br/>\npartly for a place for people to go who thought they wanted to know <br/>\nabout unschooling but wanted to be where I wasn&#39;t, and partly with <br/>\nthe intent that that would be for beginning info and <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion would be for more advanced info. People aren&#39;t <br/>\nbeing sent over, though, for the same reasons most of us discovered <br/>\nlong ago--it&#39;s good for those who get it to stay and help others get <br/>\nit. So that plan didn&#39;t really turn out as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother couple of lists grew out of the Unschooling Discussion list <br/>\ntoo, as more specialized lists, with the assumption that people would <br/>\nbe on both. AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling. Now <br/>\nneither seems like a specialized list anymore. So with five or six <br/>\nlists where there used to be the AOL boards and then <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once <br/>\ndid, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on <br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who <br/>\nhave unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all <br/>\nyoung, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm <br/>\nphilosophy and practice. It is possible--I&#39;m guessing somewhat--that <br/>\nlists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about <br/>\n*how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s <br/>\njudgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this for now: It was NOT from being kept up all night by <br/>\nkids who hit and kick them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":319946408,"authorName":"serendipitymama","from":"&quot;serendipitymama&quot; &lt;granolapunk@...&gt;","profile":"serendipitymama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: new problems I hope we can help avoid","postDate":"1204662303","msgId":32651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZxa2I2ditma3IzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1QkZFMjRBLTJGNkQtNDM0NS1BMDcwLTg1NjJBQTg2MDhBREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32649,"nextInTopic":32652,"prevInTime":32650,"nextInTime":32652,"topicId":32617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m concerned about people  <br/>\n&gt; starting to refer to their lives as &quot;RU&quot; (I don&#39;t like that at all  <br/>\n&gt; for many reasons) and some lists are calling Unschooling &quot;US&quot; (which  <br/>\n&gt; sucks nineteen ways from Sunday).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s talk about mindful parenting.  Let&#39;s talk about being  <br/>\n&gt; compassionate and peaceful.  Let&#39;s talk about living by principles.  <br/>\n&gt; Then there&#39;s  no need for separate resources based on the age of the  <br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------I&#39;m changing the subject only  <br/>\n&gt; slightly.--------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am very concerned after the conference last weekend.  It wasn&#39;t an  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling conference, but it did quite lean that direction.  I  <br/>\n&gt; observed three families in which young children were behaving  <br/>\n&gt; horribly.  I wouldn&#39;t want them at my house, though in one case I met  <br/>\n&gt; and really liked the parents.   The other two I just saw at a  <br/>\n&gt; distance, so I honestly have NO CLUE who they were, so if I say  <br/>\n&gt; something here and the family in question is reading, just suck it  <br/>\n&gt; up. No confessions are   requested and none are welcom.   I don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; know who you are and it&#39;s fine.  I want to talk about the problems,  <br/>\n&gt; not the people.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw a child hit a parent in the face, and the parent acted like it  <br/>\n&gt; was sweet and good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw a child kick a father who was carrying another child and  <br/>\n&gt; pushing a stroller.  He didn&#39;t respond negatively to having been kicked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw a child kick a mother.  Worse, a non-homeschooling friend of  <br/>\n&gt; mine saw it and mentioned it to me, and thought it was very bad.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this reflects on unschooling itself, and not at all well.  There  <br/>\n&gt; were people at the conference considering whether to be unschoolers.   <br/>\n&gt; No doubt some of them also saw such behavior, and they might not even  <br/>\n&gt; want to homeschool because of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being respectful to a child can&#39;t possibly include creating or  <br/>\n&gt; condoning a situation in which he or she has to kick or hit to get a  <br/>\n&gt; parent&#39;s attention, nor one in which kicking and hitting are treated  <br/>\n&gt; as normal and good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In light of last week&#39;s discussion about the interaction at Wendy&#39;s,  <br/>\n&gt; I will say that if ANY human being kicks me, I&#39;m going to respond  <br/>\n&gt; negatively.  If a child comes up and kicks me I&#39;m not going to smile  <br/>\n&gt; and say &quot;Oooh, hi.  Where&#39;s your mom?&quot;  I would most likely take the  <br/>\n&gt; child strongly by the arm, establish eye contact and say &quot;Don&#39;t ever  <br/>\n&gt; kick me again,&quot; and I would mean it.  I would say &quot;Don&#39;t kick  <br/>\n&gt; people.  It&#39;s not okay.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where did anyone get the idea that it was respectful to allow (or  <br/>\n&gt; require, or approve) kicking in the shins?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is anyone *REALLY* using unschooling as an excuse to encourage  <br/>\n&gt; horrible behavior?

Unfortunately, concepts<br/>\nbecome misunderstood or muddied and bits get lost in the translation.<br/>\nCommon sense gets left aside perhaps. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I have discussed this quite a bit, and discussed it last  <br/>\nThursday, most recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes what I see are the parents behaving the way they behave in  <br/>\nfront of other unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt conferences where the kids are going to stay up late or whatever,  <br/>\nyou can just about pick out the ones whose parents don&#39;t usually give  <br/>\nthem choices, but who have let them loose for the span of the  <br/>\nconference.  They exaggerate their actions and their freedom.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s a dishonesty about it all, and they don&#39;t act as calmly and  <br/>\nrationally as those kids who are used to acting the same way when  <br/>\ntheir parents aren&#39;t there as when they are.   I&#39;m talking about  <br/>\nteens now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never said unschooling was easy.  I&#39;ve never stopped trying,  <br/>\ndaily, to help people understand it.  Because some people think I&#39;m  <br/>\nabrasive (those who haven&#39;t heard me speak or don&#39;t know me, who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know my tone of voice), the UnschoolingBasics list was created  <br/>\npartly for a place for people to go who thought they wanted to know  <br/>\nabout unschooling but wanted to be where I wasn&#39;t, and partly with  <br/>\nthe intent that that would be for beginning info and  <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion would be for more advanced info.  People aren&#39;t  <br/>\nbeing sent over, though, for the same reasons most of us discovered  <br/>\nlong ago--it&#39;s good for those who get it to stay and help others get  <br/>\nit.  So that plan didn&#39;t really turn out as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother couple of lists grew out of the Unschooling Discussion list  <br/>\ntoo, as more specialized lists, with the assumption that people would  <br/>\nbe on both.  AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling.  Now  <br/>\nneither seems like a specialized list anymore.  So with five or six  <br/>\nlists where there used to be the AOL boards and then  <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once  <br/>\ndid, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on  <br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who  <br/>\nhave unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all  <br/>\nyoung, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm  <br/>\nphilosophy and practice.  It is possible--I&#39;m guessing somewhat--that  <br/>\nlists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about  <br/>\n*how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s  <br/>\njudgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this for now:  It was NOT from being kept up all night by  <br/>\nkids who hit and kick them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] my 2yo and no bedtime...little help please?","postDate":"1204656143","msgId":32639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJEMkU0NzY3LUE5RTItNDE0OS05MzQ4LTNEMzJDMjk0QTBCMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEZDNzdEMjBFLUEyREMtNDdCQy04QzE4LTdFOTlDRkM5MzFERkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGZxaWdkYStvcWNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RkM3N0QyMEUtQTJEQy00N0JDLThDMTgtN0U5OUNGQzkzMURGQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32638,"nextInTopic":32642,"prevInTime":32638,"nextInTime":32640,"topicId":32617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This came to me by private mail.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  This has been one of the problems I<br/>\nhave had to struggle with as I try to understand what is unschooling<br/>\nand what is not.  I swear I read somewhere that kids were climbing the<br/>\nwalls of the conference center at L&L last year - let me tell you,<br/>\nstuff like that keeps me away from large unschooling gatherings.  I<br/>\nhave a &quot;spirited child&quot; and I cannot imagine allowing him or any of my<br/>\nchildren to climb the decorative exterior of any building....  I quite<br/>\nenjoyed a campout last summer with 20 or so unschooling families, but<br/>\nI am afraid that some of the larger events could become somewhat of an<br/>\nanything goes free for all.  I hope I am mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still not completely clear where unschooling, radical<br/>\nunschooling, and consensual living intersect.  The math geek in me is<br/>\nthinking Venn Diagram!!  There are all of these labels tossed around<br/>\nand it sounds so appealing to grab one and try to live it rather than<br/>\nlive first and see what you are drawn to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being respectful to a child can&#39;t possibly include creating or  <br/>\n&gt; condoning a situation in which he or she has to kick or hit to get a  <br/>\n&gt; parent&#39;s attention, nor one in which kicking and hitting are treated  <br/>\n&gt; as normal and good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In light of last week&#39;s discussion about the interaction at Wendy&#39;s,  <br/>\n&gt; I will say that if ANY human being kicks me, I&#39;m going to respond  <br/>\n&gt; negatively.

Of course I want to be kinder, calmer, and rational<br/>\n- that&#39;s easier said than done.  Many of us coming from a traditional<br/>\npublic schooled background will do the homework and read the books and<br/>\napply what we think we have learned.

It wasn&#39;t an  <br/>\nunschooling conference, but it did quite lean that direction.  I  <br/>\nobserved three families in which young children were behaving  <br/>\nhorribly.  I wouldn&#39;t want them at my house, though in one case I met  <br/>\nand really liked the parents.   The other two I just saw at a  <br/>\ndistance, so I honestly have NO CLUE who they were, so if I say  <br/>\nsomething here and the family in question is reading, just suck it  <br/>\nup. No confessions are   requested and none are welcom.   I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow who you are and it&#39;s fine.  I want to talk about the problems,  <br/>\nnot the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a child hit a parent in the face, and the parent acted like it  <br/>\nwas sweet and good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a child kick a father who was carrying another child and  <br/>\npushing a stroller.  He didn&#39;t respond negatively to having been kicked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a child kick a mother.  Worse, a non-homeschooling friend of  <br/>\nmine saw it and mentioned it to me, and thought it was very bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this reflects on unschooling itself, and not at all well.

We did a lot of these same things (my son is 7, daughter is 4, <br/>\nand another son is due in May) - the family bed, no bedtimes, etc.  <br/>\nAnd it certainly wasn&#39;t always conducive to our sleep either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did several things to try to make sure everyone was able to get <br/>\nsome sleep but do it in ways that they enjoyed.  One thing we&#39;d do <br/>\nwhenever we were in one of those cycles where the kids kept wanting <br/>\nto stay up later and later is that we&#39;d put more of an emphasis on <br/>\nour mornings.  My wife and I would get up earlier and, sooner or <br/>\nlater, the kids would start getting up earlier as well in order to be <br/>\nwith us.  Eventually, they came to enjoy the mornings together better <br/>\nthan the nights together, and since they were up at 7 they naturally <br/>\nfell asleep earlier in the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading to them also worked.  We found that if we all went to bed <br/>\nearlier and spent an hour or so reading, they&#39;d almost invariable <br/>\nfall asleep within an hour.  They loved having us read to them so <br/>\nmuch that they&#39;d drop whatever else they were doing to crawl into bed <br/>\nand hear (part of) a good book!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also made sure that, even though we had a family bed where <br/>\neveryone was welcome, they also had their own rooms where they could <br/>\nsleep, play, watch TV, play games, etc. We tried to put a lot of <br/>\nextra effort into making those spaces as interesting and fun as <br/>\npossible and not to make the family bedroom too much of a playing <br/>\nplace.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that the new no routine routine has only been in place for <br/>\nthree months, it&#39;s still probably new to them and might take awhile <br/>\nto sort itself out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI write this with a smile since it&#39;s midnight and I just came down <br/>\nfrom saying good night to my daughter, who loves to stay up late and <br/>\nsleep late in the morning.  My son usually gives up around 10:30 and <br/>\ngoes to bed.  But we still have strange sleeping arrangements and <br/>\nnever know who will start or end up where.  The last few nights my <br/>\nson has wanted to sleep in our bed, possibly because he&#39;s a bit <br/>\nanxious about the new baby.  So he&#39;s slept there for the past two <br/>\nnights and I&#39;ve slept in his room.  My daughter starts in her own bed <br/>\nbut usually ends up somewhere else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal now is to make sure that every room has a comfortable place <br/>\nto sleep, because we never know where any of us will be come morning!<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;serendipitymama&quot; <br/>\n&lt;granolapunk@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; So, my 2yo has never had any sort of bedtime or bedtime routine.
