[It may be important to know, too, that this <br/>\nhappened immediately after their father died and many kind people wanted <br/>\nto say things to my kids I found horrifying and limited, and say these <br/>\nthings as if they were &quot;T&quot;ruths]<br/>\nI found the Unitarian Universalist church to be a perfect match for us.  <br/>\nI like to refer to it as our &quot;unchurch&quot; (though I&#39;ve now come to find <br/>\nthat the role of the religion in US history was greatly steeped in <br/>\ndeveloping public schools) where one is truly free to believe whatever <br/>\nis necessary for their own life to work.  There is no dogma, instead 7 <br/>\nprinciples:<br/>\n<br/>\n/We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, <br/>\ncovenant to affirm and promote/<br/>\n<br/>\n    * The inherent worth and dignity of every person;<br/>\n    * Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;<br/>\n    * Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in<br/>\n      our congregations;<br/>\n    * A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;<br/>\n    * The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process<br/>\n      within our congregations and in society at large;<br/>\n    * The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;<br/>\n    * Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we<br/>\n      are a part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe quickly discovered these principles work in our *life* not just <br/>\nSunday mornings.  Luckily, where we are now, there are several <br/>\nhomeschooling families and two of us are unschoolers.  Depending on <br/>\nwhere you are, some congregations are more Christian/Jewish/Pagan <br/>\nslanted than others; and if you&#39;re lucky you can shop around for which <br/>\ngroup meets your needs.  Our fellowship happens to be a bit more <br/>\ncerebral than my liking, but I joined the program committee to infuse my <br/>\nown spirituality into services.  (we only have one congregation in our <br/>\ntown, but larger cities have more, Minneapolis has at least 4 and <br/>\nAlbuquerque has 2 there&#39;s even one in Bemidji!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH :) diana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: DRAFT--FIX IT  Re: [AlwaysLearning] Religion and unschooling","postDate":"1138899035","msgId":24271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODU0MzU1LTIzN0QtNEEyQi1BRDlBLUZBNTBDRjIxM0YxMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUzN0MzNjRBLURGNTctNDY1NS1CQzIxLUM2MjA5Q0Y1Q0M0MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWM2Mjc4YyRmYmRjYmNkMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4gPEUzN0MzNjRBLURGNTctNDY1NS1CQzIxLUM2MjA5Q0Y1Q0M0MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24266,"nextInTopic":24272,"prevInTime":24270,"nextInTime":24272,"topicId":24250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Subject: \tDRAFT--FIX IT  Re: [AlwaysLearning] Religion and unschooling Oh THAT s where that draft went.

We are both active in our Quaker church.  Dh is a<br/>\ndeacon and runs the worship (music) team.  I sing.   That said,  If our kids<br/>\nchoose a different path, that will be theirs to navigate and we would<br/>\nabsolutely support them in whatever they choose.  We pray together, with and<br/>\nfor the kids. They see us learning, studying and putting our faith into<br/>\naction.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy 12yo son is probably the most spiritually &quot;Christian&quot; of our kids at this<br/>\npoint and he also is the one who chooses not to attend services.  That is OK<br/>\nwith us.  We understand that sitting through service, for him, does not<br/>\nenhance his faith.  It is an exercise in boredom for him.  Our two dd&#39;s like<br/>\nchurch, enjoy their friends and teachers and activities there and for the<br/>\nmost part are gracious about having to go early and stay late so dh and I<br/>\ncan do music.  The whole family loves band night when we have the worship<br/>\nteam over for dinner and to jam and practice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe believe that the love and faith we express in our home and lives is what<br/>\nmakes the biggest impact and we&#39;re grateful to have a church family that<br/>\nrespects our kids as people and does not condescend to them.  We&#39;re wary of<br/>\nbad attitudes toward kids and are very active in influencing the local<br/>\nculture.

I am Pagan and dh is a &quot;cultural Christian&quot; (he isn&#39;t very active but that is what he calls himself).  I simply live my religion, answer questions, ask the kids if they want to participate.  Some do, some don&#39;t.  2 of my kids go to the kids&#39; program at the local Baptist church.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Arlynn Liebster &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abfab@...\">abfab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 31, 2006 7:43 pm<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Religion and unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have a question.
