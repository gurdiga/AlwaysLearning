You can’t unschool against your husband’s will without risking the marriage, and divorce usually leads to school.<br/>\nYou can’t unschool well with another adult thwarting and criticizing what you’re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is that you might not be able to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the surest way to eventually get to that, maybe, is by backing away and being great with your husband instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- i&#39;m back in fear again.. now for not being in sync with husband and therefore not able to give our son the greatest gift of.trust. robbing him of it.  that&#39;s my alarmist mind. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’ve created a set of words that make you emotional and alarmed!  Don’t think of robbing him of the greatest gift.  Rhetoric is kicking your ass.  You’re brainwashing your own self. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back own, and be sweet but not divisive, and perhaps you’ll be able to advise others as you learn more so that they won’t go years without communicating clearly and openly with their partner and getting agreement all along the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- i told my son about tv..that i was thinking a lot about it.. and that maybe i was wrong about my worries.  just to offer him something since i&#39;m saying yes now to all his requests. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBe your husband’s partner first.  <br/>\nThe risk is real.  He could get a new partner, and you might get a new partner, and your son would have FOUR parents, and if two can’t agree, four will never even come close.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/divorce\">http://sandradodd.com/divorce</a><br/>\nRead around there and follow the links to the article on partnerships.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":204615647,"authorName":"","from":"vandana.purohit@...","profile":"vapurohit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"when partner is not interested in the unschooling paradigm","postDate":"1484872102","msgId":77657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG81cmsyaCtvdDM3OGtAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77658,"prevInTime":77656,"nextInTime":77658,"topicId":77657,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my son will be six in march..  i read cont concept during pregnancy and felt very much at ease in mothering for the first few years.. then tv and food fears","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-879110640\"><p>my son will be six in march.. &nbsp;i read cont concept during pregnancy and felt very much at ease in mothering for the first few years.. then tv and food fears crept in me.. and i felt icky as i grew more and more to be a police. &nbsp;i was allowing son to be in all these other wonderful ways..trusting in his wisdom and goodness.. but not with TV and food. i noticed setting limits was not fun..and was rather disconnecting. but everyone does it and i just continued..somewhere in the grey area (no consequences or conditions..but sharing my concerns to explain why this is enough, etc). &nbsp;so i started looking at my way of being with son. how it made me feel..and.questioning my fears.. and came to unschooling..the radical kind, which resonates deeply with me. it&#39;s going back to the continuum.</p><p><br></p><p>However, my husband is at odds with this.. says i&#39;m being brainwashed reading all these books/blogs/videos i immersed myself in. &nbsp;While husband does have a lot of issues with school..he is not sure about unschooling..and the &nbsp;radical part..the trusting a child part..is too much for him. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">In some ways my husband is a natural unschooler.. he doesn&#39;t try to teach son things..he just hangs out with son.. &nbsp;but he does control (as did I)..because he feels son is too small to understand his own limits.. and he doesn&#39;t want him to get cavities..which is something he wont know about till it&#39;s too late.. &nbsp;TV, food, sleep (wow all the usuals lol) and grooming. &nbsp;his approach is to tell son what he needs to do (&quot;alright that&#39;s enough tv (or sweet treat)&quot;, repeating things like &quot;brush your teeth &quot;, &quot;wash your hands&quot; to deaf ears...son will be playing and just not interested).&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>I&#39;m of course even more aware now of when husband does these things..as i became aware of all the ways iin which i controlled and have been dropping them/easing out of them. &nbsp;i told my son about tv..that i was thinking a lot about it.. and that maybe i was wrong about my worries. &nbsp;just to offer him something since i&#39;m saying yes now to all his requests. &nbsp; so i&#39;m working to drop my fears which were leading me to control son..and yet i&#39;m back in fear again.. now for not being in sync with husband and therefore not able to give our son the greatest gift of.trust. robbing him of it. &nbsp;that&#39;s my alarmist mind. &nbsp;well it makes me sad and fearful that husband and i arent&#39; on the same page. and confused in various situations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>But..I&#39;d like to unschool my husband too. partnership marriage is as important as partnership parenting. &nbsp;I have shared some things about unschooling with my husband.. an article here..a video there..
