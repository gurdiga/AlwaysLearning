Our park day group is <br/>\npretty much  made up of unschoolers and a few relaxed homeschoolers. <br/>\nThis is one of the  founding families - even though they&#39;ve never been <br/>\nclose to being  unschoolers, they have always hung out with unschoolers. <br/>\nSo, interesting  to me that they&#39;ve decided to do it after many many <br/>\nyears of them doing  curriculum while the rest of us  unschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Thanks for sharing Pam,<br/>\n <br/>\nYou just never know what will happen.  My two youngest kids were along  with <br/>\nme at the Folk Dance Center for years. Donika became an involved dancer,  and <br/>\nis now majoring in dance.  But that wasn&#39;t my point :-).  One  woman there <br/>\nknew us, and years later, she informed me that when her  granddaughter had been <br/>\nborn, she had a long talk with her daughter, and they  decided the g&#39;daughter <br/>\nshould be homeschooled because the woman was so impressed  with my kids.  I was <br/>\nblown away because we really hadn&#39;t had much, if  any, discussion on the <br/>\nsubject, and we weren&#39;t close friends or anything  like that.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow wonderful that you saw the result of the article - it was so helpful to  <br/>\nshow direction to that family - taking them just where they wanted to go!!  <br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n_www.homeschoolingreflections.com_ (http://www.homeschoolingreflections.com) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120262857,"authorName":"Janet Hamlin","from":"&quot;Janet Hamlin&quot; &lt;jefhdvm@...&gt;","profile":"jefhdvm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Making a difference","postDate":"1056283088","msgId":15299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMzMzhiNSRhNDA2NTNlMCRmNGQ4ZmVhOUBqYW5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTYyNzA3OTEuMjY2LjcxMjIubTEyQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15298,"nextInTopic":22057,"prevInTime":15298,"nextInTime":15300,"topicId":15298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good luck on your walk!
