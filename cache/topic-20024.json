I agree with what she had to say and enjoyed the discussion that followed, but I have to say I was a little disappointed that she read her talk.  It&#39;s one thing to work with notes, but to have someone read verbatim I&#39;m not really crazy about.  Just something to know if you go to see her speak. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may have to work to separate her ideas from her presentation.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nI LOVE JFW!

When I&#39;m really present in my<br/>\nlife, I try to &quot;take seriously&quot; anyone that I relate to... so for me I like<br/>\nthe basic message.  But I do have some input about my own experience while<br/>\non these other lists.  Basically, the reason I didn&#39;t stick with the TCS<br/>\nmovement is because most of the discussions included too many &quot;what if&quot;<br/>\nscenarios to make a point that things should be done this certain way.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen this happen on the unschooling lists too, but usually folks who<br/>\nhave been doing the unschooling for awhile sit on the side of real life<br/>\nexamples.  That wasn&#39;t my experience with TCS - I found that some of the<br/>\nlong time and more vocal TCS proponents were the worst at bringing up<br/>\nimaginary examples to support their cause.  With that said, I am not saying<br/>\nthat the TCS ideals promote this view, or that everyone subscribing to TCS<br/>\npromotes it, or whatever..... it just came up too often on the lists for me<br/>\nto stick with it.  Your mileage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I remember not long ago Sandra mentioning something about TCS on this<br/>\n(or another list)... so I expect she will also have some valuable input.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nciao<br/>\n--bc--</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"mozafamily","from":"&quot;mozafamily&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hello everyone!","postDate":"1090548837","msgId":20024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkcHM5NSthajYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20025,"prevInTime":20023,"nextInTime":20025,"topicId":20024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So I was wondering Sandra when are you going to be in IL talking about strewing and what exactly does that entail?
