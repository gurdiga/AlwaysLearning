I have been very<br/>\nsurprised at his ability to remember what we need! I<br/>\ncontinue to remind him (always gently) in the store<br/>\nwhat we need and why we have to be fast (remember,<br/>\nit&#39;s late and we have to get home to meet daddy, etc).<br/>\nsometimes I can make a game out of being fast, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, ask your kids for ideas. tell them what needs to<br/>\nbe accomplished, both by the shopping and in terms of<br/>\nbeing respectful of the store and other shoppers.<br/>\nthen, ask them for ideas to make it happen. would they<br/>\nlike to pick out a favorite snack food to eat in the<br/>\ncart? I have no qualms about opening something in the<br/>\nstore that I know I intend to buy. there are plenty of<br/>\ncheap toys in the grocery store here, too. it goes<br/>\nagainst my environmental grain to get yet another<br/>\nmatchbox car every time we go, but it&#39;s part of ds&#39;s<br/>\nritual now and makes my shopping much easier. let them<br/>\nknow if you need to shop for a lot of stuff and it<br/>\nmight be a longish trip, if you think they might get<br/>\nbored, etc. imo it doesn&#39;t &quot;put ideas in their heads&quot;<br/>\nto acknowledge boredom if you see it; it seems to help<br/>\nmy ds deal with it if I help him name it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree with the post that asked whether they are<br/>\nreally being problematic for others. I have always<br/>\nbeen pretty relaxed about ds&#39;s volume, but one day I<br/>\nwas wishing I could crawl under something when we were<br/>\nin ingle&#39;s. I have no idea why, but he started a game<br/>\nin which he would scream &quot;BUGGGSSS<br/>\nBUNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!&quot; over and over, top of<br/>\nhis lungs, and then crack up hysterically. I was<br/>\nbeyond embarrassed and there was nothing I could do.<br/>\ntwo women who were shopping together came by us in the<br/>\naisle and smiled at me. I shrugged and said &quot;I have no<br/>\nidea!&quot; they said &quot;sounds like he&#39;s just being a kid!&quot;<br/>\nand laughed. whew! after that I was much more relaxed<br/>\n:) (the strangest thing about that was that he had<br/>\nnever heard of bugs bunny to my knowledge at that<br/>\ntime!)<br/>\n<br/>\nshorter trips or getting dh to do some are great too,<br/>\nif you can make that work for you.

We would punish children and then they would never to that<br/>\n  thing again they got punished for. That&#39;s not the way it works out.<br/>\n  Therefore the method isn&#39;t effective. Seems like simple logic, i can&#39;t<br/>\n  believe i didn&#39;t realize it sooner.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s some people that never figure it out.  My SIL was giving me<br/>\nparenting advice when my oldest was about three.  She was telling how there<br/>\nwere several years that it seemed like her son &quot;needed a spanking&quot; everyday.<br/>\nShe told me how she had to be diligent and consistent to make sure he got<br/>\nwhat he needed.  I remembered at the time thinking there was a big problem<br/>\nwith their parenting methods - something wasn&#39;t working.  She never did<br/>\nlearn.  Did the same thing with all four of her children.  My husband<br/>\nfinally quit playing board games with this boy (he was a teen at the time)<br/>\nbecause he cheated - and his father&#39;s a minister!  Your children are<br/>\nfortunate you realized it now - earlier is better but now is way much better<br/>\nthan later.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for grocery stores, I have 5 yr. old twins.  When I go grocery shopping,<br/>\nI&#39;m usually intent on getting the best deals, comparing prices, etc.  I shop<br/>\nfor a family of seven so I need to be careful.  I don&#39;t have the time to<br/>\ngive my twins when I&#39;m shopping like that.  What we do is make special trips<br/>\njust for them at other times.  I usually never take them together unless my<br/>\nhusband is with me.  But we take them individually.  One thing they love to<br/>\ndo is go to a Dollar Store and then they get to pick out a few items while<br/>\noohing and aahing up and down all the aisles.  Lots of fun for them, and<br/>\nwhen I only have one I can follow her and let her take the lead.  If I had<br/>\nboth, I would have to hold one back and there would probably be tears.  You<br/>\nmight try making special trips with them individually when you can give them<br/>\nyour attention.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to think that children <br/>\nare ready for limitations at all ages.

When my older 3 were young it was back in the days when stores closed at 5pm and weren&#39;t open on sunday so I had no choice but to take them with me. I&#39;d go 3 times a week so it would be short trips cos kids under 5 get bored. And when they get bored, mine would get loud and often naked. Many times I turned around to find 3 naked toddlers behind me. Its funny now of course!<br/>\n  Now I tend to go alone cos Celyn hates supermarkets. Something to do with the lighting I guess?

It seems to me that leaving them at<br/>\nhome would just stunt their learning sooner.-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about helping them know WHY people behave certain ways.  When I  <br/>\nput the cart back at the grocery store after I use it, it&#39;s not  <br/>\nbecause I thing I&#39;ll be yelled at or spanked. It&#39;s because I feel  <br/>\nbetter when I do that. It seems   a better thing to do than to leave  <br/>\nit where it might roll away or be in someone&#39;s way.  If it&#39;s really  <br/>\ncold, or if one of the cart-returning workers is out there, I might  <br/>\nleave it near the car, especially if I can indicate to them that I&#39;m  <br/>\nleaving it and make some friendly gesture.  We live a few hundred  <br/>\nyards from a store, and some neighbor of ours rudely takes a cart  <br/>\npast our house and leave it. Sometimes I&#39;ve walked it back over  <br/>\nthere, or Marty has taken it when he goes to work there.  I don&#39;t do  <br/>\nit to teach my kids to do it, I do it because walking is fun or I  <br/>\nfeel like it, or I need to go to the store anyway so I might as well  <br/>\ntake it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re out walking we pick up trash we find.  Not every piece, in  <br/>\na really trashy place, but few pieces  in a very clean place, or  <br/>\nwhere kids are likely to play.  I did it before I had kids, I did it  <br/>\nwhen they were babies and toddlers and would say why I was doing it  <br/>\nwhile I was doing it, and I see them do it now when they don&#39;t know  <br/>\nI&#39;m looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kids see affects them.

I shop with two, ages 5 & 2, and we always have  <br/>\na great time. Some of the reason for that is that my kids have  <br/>\npatient, easy-going temperaments, and so do I most days &lt;g&gt;. Some  <br/>\nthings we do that help it go smoothly:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe usually have snacks in the cart. They like to get a bagel or a  <br/>\ncroissant at the bakery on the way in, or a box of animal cookies in  <br/>\nthe cookie aisle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk out loud to them a lot about what I&#39;m doing, what I&#39;m buying  <br/>\nand why, what meals we&#39;re going to fix with it, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play games. They count down to blast-off every time we have to  <br/>\nmove the cart; they pretend to be firefighters leaping onto the cart  <br/>\nto go fight a fire; if the aisle is empty, I jog a little and run in  <br/>\na serpentine pattern, saying, &quot;Oh, no, we&#39;re out of control! What  <br/>\nwill become of us? Aaaah!&quot; Stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring new books from the library to look at in the cart (our  <br/>\ngrocery store has carts with two-kid benches attached that they  <br/>\nreally like to ride on), or their magnetic slates. Sometimes lately  <br/>\nwe jog quickly through the toy aisle on the way in and get something  <br/>\nin the $2-5 range, like a matchbox car or small Lego toy that they  <br/>\ncan play with while we shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wonder what will happen when 5 yo Eric is older and these games  <br/>\ndon&#39;t entertain him, but maybe by then he&#39;ll be able to actively help  <br/>\nwith the shopping, or choose to stay home (my partner works full-time  <br/>\nfrom home).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; .

As hard as his behavior has been for me  <br/>\nduring that period, there&#39;s no point in punishing because if he could  <br/>\ncontrol himself, he would!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I guess i&#39;m really just wondering<br/>\n&gt; how you teach them to respect boundries outside the home that they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really seem to care about. It seems to me that leaving them at<br/>\n&gt; home would just stunt their learning sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have left places when we needed to, if Eric was unable to behave  <br/>\nappropriately. We try not to be punitive or blaming about it, just &quot;I  <br/>\nsee that you are not able to stay in your seat. I&#39;m going to take you  <br/>\noutside while Mama gets our food packed up and pays the bill,&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll come back and spend more time at the library another day.&quot; I  <br/>\nthink it does feel punitive to him, nonetheless, at least sometimes,  <br/>\nbut we try to be matter-of-fact and not lecture.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrocery shopping is a high-stress errand. It takes a long time, it&#39;s  <br/>\nhard to cut the trip short if necessary, the artificial lights start  <br/>\nto get to some people after awhile, the store is often full of cranky  <br/>\npeople, and there are never enough registers open. If doing the  <br/>\ngrocery shopping is too hard for a family, there are lots of other,  <br/>\nless stressful, opportunities for kids to learn how to behave in  <br/>\npublic. A quick trip into a convenience store, the bakery, the  <br/>\nlibrary, the copy shop, the post office--those are all chances for  <br/>\nkids to practice behaving appropriately without having to maintain  <br/>\nthat behavior for a very long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with Eric, sometimes there is something he&#39;s not ready for, and  <br/>\nno amount of practice will help him get it. An example of this is  <br/>\nlying back in the chair and staying there with his mouth open for a  <br/>\nwhole dental cleaning. At his cleaning when he had just turned four,  <br/>\nhe was alarmed by being asked to recline; every time the hygienist  <br/>\nstopped for a moment to get a different instrument, he closed his  <br/>\nmouth and tried to climb down; and ultimately he did not get a  <br/>\ncomplete cleaning because it was being too stressful for him and we  <br/>\nweren&#39;t going to get through it without getting more coercive than  <br/>\nthe situation called for. Six months later? He hopped into the chair,  <br/>\nlay back with his feet casually crossed, opened his mouth, and just  <br/>\nlay there looking relaxed while the hygienist did a very thorough  <br/>\ncleaning and checked his teeth. The difference wasn&#39;t that he&#39;d been  <br/>\nto the dentist a lot in between and learned how to behave there; the  <br/>\ndifference was the dramatic difference in development between &quot;just  <br/>\nbarely four&quot; and &quot;almost five.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202326349,"authorName":"Tami","from":"&quot;Tami&quot; &lt;atj090@...&gt;","profile":"jamitory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: grocery stores","postDate":"1145242515","msgId":25270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENORURKSUJIRUdGSUFEQUFQT0ROR0VBQ0NGQUEuYXRqMDkwQGdhbGF4eS5vY24ubmUuanA+","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxdXVubSt1NXYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25269,"nextInTopic":25271,"prevInTime":25269,"nextInTime":25271,"topicId":25257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... last night that if punishment worked we wouldn t need to continue to do it.

Because  <br/>\nmy daughter has autism, we needed to get lots of little trips in  <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t know if she would be able to go shopping without  <br/>\nwork.   We did, out of necessity, plan short trips. We did LOTS of  <br/>\nrewards.  We go shopping probably four times a week for groceries  <br/>\n(granted it takes a lot to feed us all), and we always talk about  <br/>\nwhat we need before we go, they have lots of input on what we buy,  <br/>\nand they have lots of input about timing. If the kids have lots of  <br/>\nenergy, we don&#39;t go then, we go to a park first. If they are too  <br/>\ntired, we cancel altogether and dh or I go after he gets home from work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake them late at night. Or early in the am. I like to go around 7am  <br/>\nwith the kids, there&#39;s no one there except the workers or ol&#39; folks,  <br/>\nboth of whom pretty much don&#39;t care. I do expect the kids to stay  <br/>\nwhere they can see me, for safety reasons and for convenience (it  <br/>\ntakes too long trying to find people over and over).<br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I both like to go for short trips, and take one kid with us.  <br/>\nWe pick up two or three things, buy a soda, and sit on the curb and  <br/>\ntalk. It&#39;s a cheap and easy date, and gives them one on one in a  <br/>\nstore so that they have your full attention, they get to practice,  <br/>\nand they are learning how people act and how to buy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 16, 2006, at 8:09 PM, Julie W in AR wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parenting style<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and i wasn&#39;t sure what to do.
