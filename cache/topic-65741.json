I never wanted/want any of my children to ever feel that I wasn&#39;t in &quot;their corner&quot;.  It&#39;s been difficult because when I feel any of my children are being mistreated I naturally swoop in like a protective momma cat, even at the cost of my son&#39;s feelings and possibly, his self-worth.  This is why I&#39;m so thankful for the advice received here.  It has given me another way to approach and look at the whole situation.

For the first born it&#39;s very much like if your husband brought home a new wife because he loved the first one so much he decided to have another. Subsequent kids know that everything in the family is for sharing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parents assume the first born is having the same experience with the newborn as they are, they can easily make the situation even worse for the first child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The parents weren&#39;t teens, but adults. a woman&#39;s body naturally spaces children every two years for a reason!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what that means to parents who are teens. Or for children born closer than or further apart than 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans having evolved to produce kids an average of 2 years apart has little to do with the relationships between the kids and everything to do with maximizing the number of offspring that can reproduce as successfully as their parents in the environment they&#39;re in. Humans have evolved to nurture and care for our offspring not because evolution &quot;cares&quot; about such values but because it makes it more likely that generation will survive and reproduce. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat we -- and hyenas and possums and robins -- expend energy to nurture our young to adulthood is just one possibility that arose by chance. It allowed species to exploit environments that needed more knowledge to succeed in than could be passed on by biology. We&#39;re not superior -- as far as evolution is concerned -- to turtles, sharks and cockroaches, which haven&#39;t needed to change their basic designs in longer than humans have existed. We&#39;re just different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs amazing and wonderful loving and being loved feels, its roots are purely a mechanism for maximizing offspring. Which, rather than diminishing it, I think makes it even more amazing. :-) But imagining evolution (or God) having designed us to be loving and nurturing creatures, if you look at how poorly some people manage to do it, then  the design looks very flawed. But if it&#39;s seen as a fluke that we&#39;ve exploited this mechanism to the point where I can care enough to spend my time writing to people I don&#39;t know to help them nurture kids who aren&#39;t related to me, then I think that nurturing mechanism looks pretty wondrous :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":502477525,"authorName":"bellumswife77","from":"&quot;bellumswife77&quot; &lt;stefanie@...&gt;","profile":"bellumswife77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Concerns about how my son treats my daughter","postDate":"1329736708","msgId":65774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpodGE2NCs5OWRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEE0MjkwNTRBLURDNDItNDI1RS1BMzdBLUFGQjg0MTgyQURGQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65773,"nextInTopic":65775,"prevInTime":65773,"nextInTime":65775,"topicId":65741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe thinking of your son as a bully is overwhelming your ability to respond to individual specific situations because what you are wishing and hoping for is a way to cure him.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. I am not dealing with just this one incident, but with the big picture.  On one hand, I want to spare him from the mindset I&#39;ve taught him and help him change that now, while knowing I ultimately can&#39;t do that.

That&#39;s a setup for a problem. Instead, graciously and sweetly send them off on their way to do something fun and you offer to rinse the dishes. &quot;Hey, go ahead back to your .....(game, show, toy, whatever)... and I&#39;ll do the dishes.&quot; Gently and kindly just reach over and take his dishes and move to the sink. Smile. Pat his head or even give him a little kiss on the top of his head!**<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat idea!  Thank you!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n**Another thought - are they eating at the same time because you have &quot;meal times?&quot; Consider taking them food where they are already hanging out - rather than them having to come to the table together to eat.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t meal times.  We tend to eat most breakfasts and dinners together, but they WANT to.  I&#39;m just as happy eating on the couch.  They like the togetherness at the table so we do that when possible.  The other side of all of this is that they are ALWAYS together.  They play together all the time and have many similar interests.  Izzy had started eating, then Darius decided to eat.  Sometimes they eat lunch separately, but not often.  Sometimes Izzy skips lunch and will just graze.  Darius grazes, but also never skips &quot;meals&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**My heart is kind of going out to your son - the big bad bully with the sensitive and sweet sister. It can&#39;t feel good to be thought of that way. So do make HUGE extra efforts to be sweet and loving to him and pay attention to him in good ways.** <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it can&#39;t.  Then Izzy often feels badly because her brother is good at math, good at getting things done, he is a whiz at anything &quot;technological&quot;, etc...  They both feel &quot;inadequate&quot; in their own ways.  I have a lot of work to do.  I have tried to encourage them in their personal gifts and talents and tried not to compare them.  We all have our own strengths and weaknesses, but I never wanted to make them feel badly about their differences.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a good job of that.  How do I affirm them individually without making them feel like my love and affection is based on &quot;performance&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n**At the same time, be calm and clear when protecting your daughter. I used and really like the kind of language Sandra suggested that is a little more impersonal  and informative like &quot;one at a time.&quot; However, it might also be that you can overlook some of the less egregious stuff while you&#39;re in the process of improving things overall, so you don&#39;t start sounding like nag who corrects constantly...otherwise you&#39;ll be tuned out.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are onto something with this.  I think the less &quot;disciplinarian&quot; I come across as, the better right now.  I am still not on solid ground when it comes to this way of being.  I&#39;m just now beginning to &quot;get&quot; unschooling, much less radical unschooling.  I need to focus more on making our environment more peaceful where we can connect more deeply and make that the priority over how they are interacting with one another.  How can I go about fixing their relationship when our own has suffered so much?  *rhetorical* but if you have input, it&#39;s absolutely welcomed!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n**Don&#39;t explain what you&#39;re doing...just do it. IF he ever complains that you&#39;re &quot;on her side,&quot; then, first, remember that he probably REALLY feels that way and give him some very direct love and attention (eye contact, physical contact), second, say, &quot;You BOTH deserve to be safe in your own home.&quot;**<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.

They love spending time with me doing things and despite the controlling aspects, they tell me often how much fun they have with me.  We climb trees together, (when I&#39;m not pregnant), and I actually spend a lot of time outside with them in their world.  They have pointed out to me on many occasions that they notice that the other parents don&#39;t and they love that I do.  I&#39;m thankful they still want to be around me.  :-)  I have two sides to my personality...one is the fear-based side that feels like it needs to control so many things, then I have another side that is like I am a kid as well.

Most of us tend to be &quot;get it done&quot; kinds of people, not my Izzy.  She&#39;s a stop and smell the roses kind of gal and has taught me how to do the same. As for Darius, I could definitely see him just wanting to get the dish done and get on with the next thing.  Darius is like this,most of the time:  when he is playing and realizes he&#39;s hungry, he wants to eat now, before he is done eating, he already knows the next thing he wants to be doing.  He is always moving and shaking.  Izzy is completely opposite.  She is very in the moment.  He tends to be more &quot;task oriented&quot; as to where Izzy is more &quot;relationship oriented&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n**The dishes are a habit. It&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done.

He is very helpful.  He is always asking me if there is anything he can do for me, but even this I have been reflecting on lately.

I&#39;ve been thinking that if he really wanted to do something &quot;for me&quot; then the opportunities are all around, so I think there may be more to it, like maybe he thinks this is a way to please me.  I know when I was growing up, I always felt like nothing I did was good enough, but I rebelled.  I didn&#39;t try to be more helpful to my parents, but it could be that he feels that I am &quot;happy with him&quot; when he behaves a certain way and performs a certain way and instead of rebelling and I can definitely understand why.  This has been my message to him and Izzy.  He may be trying to do what he thinks will please me.  I wish I could get inside his head!<br/>\n<br/>\n**Mine does it quit a bit.  He&#39;s older, and he didn&#39;t always, but he&#39;s more likely than anyone else in the house to clear the table as people are finishing up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to pay more attention to their spontaneous ways.  They give their own gifts like they will come into my room sometimes and help me with my bed, or the ways they help care for their little sister, even how they enjoy playing with her.  They have been raised with more of a &quot;have to&quot; mentality.  There were things that were expected of them and even if they have become habits, they have become so from a place of having to.  The things they don&#39;t feel they &quot;have to&quot; do are obviously more enjoyable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nZoe, my two year old, is being raised differently than what I knew at the time when I had Darius and Izzy.  I learned of Attachment Parenting when I was pregnant with her and we did the baby-wearing, nursing on demand, she slept with me, etc...  I wish I had known about it when I was 22 and pregnant with Darius, but I didn&#39;t learn of it till I was 31.  So all of this has flowed much easier with Zoe as to where with Darius and Izzy we had all these previous years of traditional &quot;I&#39;m the boss.  You are the child.

What can happen is that you learn ways<br/>\nto create greater and greater harmony in your family life and he&#39;ll<br/>\neventually be immersed in that and it will start to seem natural to him and<br/>\nhe won&#39;t so often have the urge to disrupt it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I don&#39;t think you can ever hope to entirely eliminate all friction between<br/>\nsiblings ever.

Smile. Pat his head or even give him a little kiss on<br/>\nthe top of his head!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought - are they eating at the same time because you have &quot;meal<br/>\ntimes?&quot; Consider taking them food where they are already hanging out -<br/>\nrather than them having to come to the table together to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart is kind of going out to your son - the big bad bully with the<br/>\nsensitive and sweet sister. It can&#39;t feel good to be thought of that way.<br/>\nSo do make HUGE extra efforts to be sweet and loving to him and pay<br/>\nattention to him in good ways.

I was so overwhelmed by life at the time that<br/>\nI was just focused on putting out fires between the full time job and the<br/>\ninfant and toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If he takes the sprayer away from his sister, think of it as<br/>\n&gt; something that was done to her, rather than something he did to someone.<br/>\n&gt; Defend her in her own home without trying to manage him.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say in front of my son, to my daughter (and mean it), &quot;I am sorry<br/>\nthat Sebastian somehow learned that it is okay not to respect you, I will<br/>\ntry to be more respectful so that I am a better example.  Maybe we can work<br/>\non telling each other when we don&#39;t feel respected.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you can only do this if you mean it.  It isn&#39;t to shame your son,<br/>\nit is to acknowledge that you have made mistakes and modeled bad behavior<br/>\nand that your daughter has gotten the fallout from  these mistakes.  It is<br/>\nalso an acknowledgment that you have to work on your behavior.  You have to<br/>\nbe genuine and actually mean what you say.  Your kids will know if are<br/>\nbullsh*tting.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving permission and creating an atmosphere where everyone can state their<br/>\nfeelings and needs and be heard is hard work, but worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part is that you definitely should try to find time with your son<br/>\none on one, and your daughter as well.  Work on building relationships.<br/>\nThis will lead to more joy and peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252464818,"authorName":"Christina","from":"&quot;Christina&quot; &lt;daharryrc@...&gt;","profile":"daharryrc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Concerns about how my son treats my daughter","postDate":"1329686504","msgId":65746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpocnA1OCtqNjhiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZGNUZCMjlCLTVCMUMtNEJDMi04OTNDLUY3RDM0MjUyMjdFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65742,"nextInTopic":65749,"prevInTime":65745,"nextInTime":65747,"topicId":65741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for your response and for the link.

I had read some previously about &quot;saying yes more&quot; and in addition to being better for the kids rather than being thrown into such a different way all at once, it has definitely been better for me while I transition.  :-)  I would&#39;ve had a lot more anxiety doing it &quot;all at once&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, he was robbed and his face when he came to see me in the hospital after his sister was born told it all.  I remember that expression like it was yesterday.  He was so used to having all my attention and at 19 months had to share me.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWould you please give me an example of what it would look like to defend her without trying to manage him?  Sounds great since I could still be there for her, without making my son the &quot;bad guy&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dishes are a habit.  It&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done.  Even our 2 year old wants to be helped up to the sink to rinse her dish out and put it in the dishwasher.  I&#39;m not seeing any friction in this area, but I suppose there could be.  Should I ask him how he feels about rinsing and putting his dishes in the dishwasher?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nChristina.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What jumped out at me in all your description was that you had a two year old baby, and had another baby.

Example:  Izzy was rinsing out her lunch dish and he walked over to her and took the faucet away from her.  Rinsed his dish and put it in the sink.  Another example is when she is &quot;in his way&quot;, he will often push her.  He speaks to her in what is in my opinion a condescending manner.  I&#39;ve always gotten in the middle and have shamed him for treating his sister this way or bullied him, myself, to &quot;get him&quot; to treat her differently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I can see that he has gotten his own bullying tendencies, (in part at least), from the example his dad and I have shown him.  We have been &quot;authoritarian&quot;, (bullies), up until the past 2 years where we started to change,but still have a LONG way to go.  Learning of unschooling and the way it is affecting me in all areas has been very helpful in beginning to recognize these conditioned patterns.  These old thought patterns die hard.  I am sure he would feel the same way at this point, since he&#39;s been raised that basically, when you are older and stronger, then people have to submit to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if I try to manipulate him in any way to change his behavior, that I am repeating the same pattern of parenting we&#39;ve done for so many years.  I don&#39;t want to do that, but don&#39;t know what to do.  I need some input as to how to deal with these situations, for both of their sakes.  Izzy is a very sensitive child and I confess that I worry about her.  The way her brother treats her, affects her very deeply.  I also worry about my son&#39;s future relationships.  He is a very loving child with me.  So tender, sensitive, and helpful, but if he views someone as weaker than himself, he is a different child towards that person and will use that to get what he wants, (just as he has learned from us).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to continue to default into trying to control his behavior towards her, but I don&#39;t want to let my daughter be bullied by her brother.  Have any ex- or in the process of becoming ex-bully parents dealt with their children bullying siblings?  Looking for any input, stories, whatever and help to see what I am not seeing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nChristina.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65794,"nextTopicId":65827}}
