The main library in our system has over 600 (yes, six hundred)holds on the new one.  However, with libraries in mind there are a few things you could check if you think that having more than one copy of certain books would solve the problem--likely it would.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two cards--one personal card and one teacher card, my young son has his own card and my husband has a card--he could get a teacher card too if he wanted one.  This would allow us to place 4 (or 5) reserves on a book title.  We could also each place a hold on an audio file but they may not have that many to loan.  If you go with older books there are a lot of free resources, other than libraries, that let you download.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also allowed to check out multiple copies through my teacher card.  The multiple copies are not known to many patrons because they are mostly used for book talks or for teachers for their classes but that does not mean they are not available to you.  Libraries do things in many different ways and most are willing to work with you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nsheila<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That would be SO cool if they&#39;d let multiple people have the book at the <br/>\n&gt; same time, but my library system treats the downloadable audio books <br/>\n&gt; just like other books - when you go to download it (check it out) you <br/>\n&gt; choose a 7 or a 14 day lending period.

A kind of <br/>\nvicious cycle got going, in which one would stay on a really long time <br/>\n(even though in other areas of life they were quite generous and <br/>\nthoughtful) because she knew that if she got off the computer then, she <br/>\nmight not get it back that day at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - after trying quite a few ideas, this is the one that worked well <br/>\nand seemed to satisfy everybody. If someone was on the computer and <br/>\nnobody else wanted it, they&#39;d stay on as long as they wanted. No limits. <br/>\nThere was a kitchen timer sitting next to the computer and if someone <br/>\nelse was wanting a turn, they would set the timer for one hour. It <br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter how long the person had already been on there, they&#39;d get <br/>\nanother hour - if they&#39;d been on five hour, they&#39;d still get another <br/>\nhour. That seemed to satisfy all three of them. What I often heard was, <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m getting on the computer and I&#39;d really like to have at least 2 <br/>\nhours or even 3 for this game - is that okay with you guys?&quot; They&#39;d <br/>\nagree, in advance.

One of them might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the computer, if someone woke up and wanted to use it, he was  <br/>\nafter me if I was on, but I always could find something I needed to do  <br/>\nand usually let him have it.  The next kid who wanted it was next in  <br/>\nline, and the slot opened up when Kirby was done.  A &quot;turn&quot; didn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed to have a time limit, though needing to be somewhere could get  <br/>\nsomeone a go as the others knew he would be gone for hours.  Sometimes  <br/>\nthe computer sat unused, but when we only had one computer and three  <br/>\nor four users, it wasn&#39;t often.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we finally have more computers than people and that issue faded  <br/>\ninto the distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the front seat, there was a rotation, and it was in reverse age  <br/>\norder.  If Holly got the front last time, it was Marty&#39;s turn.  But we  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t call it his turn &quot;to sit in the front,&quot; it was his turn to  <br/>\nchoose.  Often the choice was to sit in the front, but if he wanted  <br/>\nthe whole back seat or the one behind the driver where the air  <br/>\nconditioning was best, that was fine.   Had there been a squabble  <br/>\nthen, it would&#39;ve been Kirby&#39;s choice next, but I think we only  <br/>\ninvoked that clause once.  But it basically set up a precedence of  <br/>\nchoices, and that rotated. So if it was Kirby&#39;s turn in the front and  <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want it or if he wasn&#39;t even there, Holly had next choice.    <br/>\nWhen that happened, it went to Marty next.   Nobody ever said &quot;Yes but  <br/>\nlast time I had it as #2, and this is my #1 time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe with the book you could do that.  If the youngest didn&#39;t want  <br/>\nit, the middle could have it.   Next time you read, it&#39;s the next kid  <br/>\nin line&#39;s turn to read or pass it to the one who would have come after  <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question how to handle bickering...","postDate":"1244536761","msgId":45772,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0MjI0MC45MDEyMy5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1Q0VFRjU3NkQ3NTQzRkVBMEQwNjNEOUNGQ0U4RkY3QEtlbGx5c0dyb292ZXlMVD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1Q0VFRjU3NkQ3NTQzRkVBMEQwNjNEOUNGQ0U4RkY3QEtlbGx5c0dyb292ZXlMVD4="},"prevInTopic":45770,"nextInTopic":45773,"prevInTime":45771,"nextInTime":45773,"topicId":45768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Get the next book in the series in multiple copies, have it at the ready asap.

You could get to a photocopying machine and copy the chapters out of your book to get you through this book. If you have a flatbed scanner you could scan it to your computer and print it out. Is there a used bookstore near where you live? A Borders, a Barnes and Noble? Hop in the car and go buy 2 extra copies. The library may very well have more than one copy. You could probably check on-line and see if it&#39;s on the shelves. Read more to them, keep reading when they ask for the next chapter. Get it on cd or as a download and put it on the stereo so that some one else can read it to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiple copies is the best answer, and it is really an option. It will help if they know you are working to get them more copies. It will help for them to see you doing what you can to fulfill their needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Kelly Halldorson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kelly@...\">kelly@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 14, 12 & 11. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read to them (and my husband), often.
