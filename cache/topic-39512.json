Maybe the wrong word, but whatever the right word for<br/>\nit, I am reacting to my own unschooling with fear.-----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was lucky.  I read this story: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3fyx\">http://tinyurl.com/3fyx</a> which is by<br/>\nKurt Vonnegut.  It was posted on one of the unschooling lists not long ago.<br/>\nThe cute thing about that (and not the point of the story) is that being<br/>\nconditioned by the school experience doesn&#39;t work well when someone can<br/>\nignore it.  The programming doesn&#39;t take near as well if a person interprets<br/>\n(or reinterprets) their experiences by tuning out the obviously silly<br/>\n(seemingly &quot;sensible&quot;) words around them.  Some ways to avoid truisms are<br/>\nbooks, movies, and a myriad of other things to do in life... whatever is at<br/>\nhand to muffle the message which school is and to cut into its believability<br/>\nwith real life experience made by real living people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much of what we hear about school is hearsay, old wive&#39;s tales, straight<br/>\nout lies, and hum ho .. theory!  Unschooling is a great theory and since I<br/>\nlike it and have experienced quite a few of its benefits (Karl is only 5 and<br/>\nso far it&#39;s been absolutely amazing) I&#39;m sticking with unschooling as my<br/>\nstory!  You can do that, you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides school, there&#39;s work right on its heels!  With the overarching<br/>\nmessage that one must do school and work in order to succeed or even just to<br/>\nsurvive, people can go all their lives without reframing school and work.<br/>\nSchool and regular 9-5 jobs are options.  But they&#39;re far from the only ones<br/>\navailable to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot reinterpreting personal experiences can make unschooling more difficult,<br/>\nI think.  Even if a reinterpretation of the world isn&#39;t the end-all-be-all<br/>\ntruth, it may offer more ideas for reconsidering the role of school and work<br/>\nin our lives.  Unschooling allows one to put school and work on another<br/>\nplane ... the UN in unschool is to leave school behind ... and observe them<br/>\nas separate from oneself.  So that they&#39;re not constantly RIGHT there,<br/>\nstaring at us as the only reality there is.  Unschooling is a great thing to<br/>\nwake up to in the middle of the night, in your subconscious, all the time.<br/>\nVery liberating stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy for just anyone to think like that.  Brian works (way too)<br/>\nmany hours per day.  He doesn&#39;t get unschooling as much as I do because he<br/>\nhasn&#39;t considered school and work alternatives the way I have.  So his<br/>\nbeliefs are slanted much more towards school and work which he has been<br/>\nconditioned to believe in.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelationships and wholeness aren&#39;t even questioned.  Make those those things<br/>\nyour quest, and be driven by a need to get to them.  Think in the middle of<br/>\nthe night about how to attain those, and don&#39;t let school and work limit<br/>\nyour children.  Avoid school and work as goals at all.  If your kids want to<br/>\ngo to school, college or have a job... let them be the kid&#39;s goal(s).  *You*<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to make your kid&#39;s schooling, college or career be your goal(s).<br/>\nRemember.... relationships, wholeness, avenues to a big wide world.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Reactions to Unschooling","postDate":"1224284810","msgId":39539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczQUI4MDc3LUJEN0MtNDk1RC05MDAwLUREQTUzREU4QjM0MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxOTQwNC41MzQwMC5xbUB3ZWI1NjIwNC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQxOTQwNC41MzQwMC5xbUB3ZWI1NjIwNC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39538,"nextInTopic":39544,"prevInTime":39538,"nextInTime":39540,"topicId":39512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It is a conflict for me.

But I have to tell you, the ingrained information about what is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;what gets you to where you need to be going&quot; still scream at me all day long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to embrace 100% the principles and the respect and proper freedom like that which Joyce and Sandra and other veterens have offered their children and families.  But I am soooo torn daily, with the panic of &quot;if I don&#39;t TEACH them ___________, than they won&#39;t be successful, or get into college, or be able to hold a job that actually will make them a living.&quot;  OR, &quot;If I don&#39;t create a consequence for _______behavior, than that behavior will continue and it is hurtful to others..&quot;  These are just 2 vague examples, but truly even as I type and my tired kids are playing Halo...I am in a panic that they ARE playing and yes, I would feel so much better if they would take me up on my plan of making cut out pumpkins, or grooming the animals, or......<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a conflict for me.  It is different for me than was attachment parenting.  I followed my HEART with my children from day 1, but those things (nursing, family bed, no circumcision, sling, no crying-it-out etc) seemed like NO brainers.  This shift of unschooling from homeschooling feels more intellectual perhaps? Maybe the wrong word, but whatever the right word for it, I am reacting to my own unschooling with fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when reading the other posts on this subject of reaction....most things are reacted to from a place of fear and knee jerk reactions.  Growth takes place when the fear can be examined and worked THROUGH.  MOST people find that very uncomfortable and may not feel like bringing yet another stressor into THEIR lives---for the sake of the children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am---but I am admitting that embracing it without an inner cringe is a really hard thing for me, and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter the amount of intellectual agreement I have with it, it is the ingrained, almost cellular level conditioning about what the &quot;shoulds&quot; are in life (like education....school...rules, consequences, limitations even), are all part of this conditioning.  I call it &quot;the middle of the night panic&quot;.  It is usually ok during the day with a few exceptions like the one happening right now...but in the middle of the night.......yikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend not to respond on line but I do so to hopefully strike up a conversation about how to silent the other voice...how to forge forward with more confidence with the choice of unschooling--knowing it is as good as it gets. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://www.sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80776775,"authorName":"Kelly Nishan","from":"&quot;Kelly Nishan&quot; &lt;kel9769@...&gt;","profile":"kel9769","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reactions to Unschooling","postDate":"1224269452","msgId":39535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkYW1xYyttZ3ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdkYWl1cSttM2NmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39534,"nextInTopic":39537,"prevInTime":39534,"nextInTime":39536,"topicId":39512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... grades ... she ...

It really blows me away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was around 5 years old and I had just discovered unschooling,<br/>\nI talked about it a lot for the first couple years. I figured it was just<br/>\nsomething that people hadn&#39;t heard about or didn&#39;t understand.  I thought<br/>\nthat as soon as people understood, they would be as happy as I was to have<br/>\ndiscovered it and jump on the band wagon.  I was so excited about it I<br/>\nwanted to shout it from the roof tops.  I figured I had a big audience of<br/>\npeople who would be excited to learn about it on parenting and homeschool<br/>\nlists that I was on.  The way in which I chose to share it was to focus on<br/>\nhow it worked in our lives.  I was very conscious not to come across as<br/>\ncritical of others but to focus on the positive outcome in our lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was shocked at the reactions it brought out in people.  I used to have a<br/>\nweb page and I used to participate on local home school and parenting lists.<br/>\nThe public and even worse, the private emails that I occasionally got that<br/>\nwere so reactive and hateful were horrible.  I got a lot of positive<br/>\nresponses too and I know I turned several people on to unschooling. (some<br/>\nthat I still keep in touch with) but I really couldn&#39;t deal with the hateful<br/>\nreactions of people who felt attacked despite that all my emails were about<br/>\nme and my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy skin is a lot thicker now than it used to be and I do understand why<br/>\npeople are that way, to some degree,  (They don&#39;t want to question education<br/>\nbecause it opens them up to have to questions a lot more in their lives and<br/>\nits not always a comfortable place to be.) but I still am thankful and<br/>\namazed by the people who advocate unschooling on this list (and others) and<br/>\nwho answer the same questions over and over and who get the hateful emails<br/>\nand yet continue to do it for the benefit of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt brought too much negativity into my life and I had a hard time separating<br/>\nmyself from all that negativity.  Some day I&#39;ll be a stronger advocate again<br/>\nfor unschooling but for now I just focus on my own kids and the joy I can<br/>\nbring to their lives.  I admire the people who can do both.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reactions to Unschooling","postDate":"1224265498","msgId":39531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkYWl1cSttM2NmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdkOXA2YSszMzM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39530,"nextInTopic":39534,"prevInTime":39530,"nextInTime":39532,"topicId":39512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I knew all those ideas went drown the drain that exact second.<br/>\nEven sending my baby to school  for a stranger to tell him what he &quot;needed&quot; to learn was not an option anymore.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335633701,"authorName":"DaBreeze21","from":"&quot;DaBreeze21&quot; &lt;susanmay15@...&gt;","profile":"DaBreeze21","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reactions to Unschooling","postDate":"1224215036","msgId":39515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkOTFsdCs2bDgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5QjlBRTk1LURFMDgtNDY2My1CODc3LUM4NTA0MzUzQkY3QkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39513,"nextInTopic":39516,"prevInTime":39514,"nextInTime":39516,"topicId":39512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
