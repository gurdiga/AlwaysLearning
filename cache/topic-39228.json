Seem like so <br/>\nmany of them center around some very preconscieved adult agenda.  <br/>\nSome things seem to work but others just dont. Having 4 kids I need <br/>\nto find things that work for all my kids at least to some degree.  <br/>\nFor ex.  we were asked to participate in a Kindergarten group.  I <br/>\nfelt the idea of it was kind of silly but it is really just a <br/>\nplaygroup with a few art or science activities on occasion so I <br/>\nagreed. But I bring all my kids and spend alot of time trying to <br/>\nfind something for my 3 year old to do as he was deemed to young to <br/>\nparticipate by the coordinator... it is a kindergarten group after <br/>\nall.  My 7 year old, who really doesnt care about ages at all, is <br/>\nalso treated with some suspicion.  Anyway, That being all said I am <br/>\ngoing to start fresh and start looking for and organizing some more <br/>\nmultiage activities.  For example I saw a multiage art activity <br/>\nlisted, they are making one specific thing but the idea was for <br/>\neveryone to come with materials and ideas and enjoy the <br/>\nexperience.

Any ideas for things you all have done?<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39226,"nextTopicId":39153}}
