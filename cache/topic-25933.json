","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-645818711\">---- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ken Cooper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ken@...\">ken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nHas anyone else experienced this sort of thing with their young (5ish) kids?<br/>\nAnd if so, how has it played out?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my experience.  I let up on the video game restrictions a month or<br/>\nso ago.  Before that we were &quot;limitations lite&quot; as you say.<br/>\nMy teens probably play less now than they did when we had fixed limits.   My<br/>\n10yo plays a bit more than he did when we had limits, but I like the way he <br/>\nplays<br/>\nnow better.   Now he can feel boredom and stop by choice<br/>\nand go on to something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the younger set:  my 6yo never really had many video game or TV<br/>\nrestrictions.   This is because he is medically fragile and often in the<br/>\nhospital where videos and TV are a key resource.   He also is not<br/>\nthat INTERESTED in spending a lot of time doing these things.  He will play<br/>\na game for a few minutes and then go on to something else.  Right now<br/>\nhe is recovering from having his feeding tube removed and we&#39;re trying to<br/>\nencourage him to watch TV so he&#39;ll keep quiet and not stress his wound, but<br/>\nhe&#39;d rather be outside or playing ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\n My 3yo is the one who is spending the most time on computer games right <br/>\nnow.    I remember my other kids going through the same stage when they were <br/>\nhis age.  They<br/>\nsuddenly realized how newly capable they were.    I&#39;m amazed at all the <br/>\nthings he&#39;s figured out how to do with the computer.  He can do things that <br/>\nI can&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this feels a bit threatening to me in some ways because I can hear<br/>\nJane Healy&#39;s voice in my head telling me about his endangered mind and<br/>\nfailure to connect.  But this is not really what I SEE when I look at what<br/>\nhe&#39;s actually doing.   He&#39;s going through a developmental surge and the<br/>\ncomputer is helping him.   He&#39;s becoming capable of doing things he couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo a few short months ago, things that consolidate his membership in the<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\nSo maybe the game is a haven for your 5yo but maybe it&#39;s also a challenge he<br/>\ncan meet and feel good about?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3.5yo does seem to have a lot of wiggliness after he&#39;s played for a while<br/>\nso Jacki&#39;s description of the &quot;need to move&quot; is helpful for me.   He will<br/>\ncharge at me and want to wrestle, without much warning.  So knowing this, I <br/>\ncan be ready to do some active interpersonal play after he gets off the <br/>\ncomputer rather than being surprised and irritated by his sudden energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking that if your 5yo is playing on the computer for a<br/>\nlong time and then showing energy and some irritation afterwards, he might<br/>\nneed a transition time.   My 6yo sometimes needs help and support in <br/>\ntransitioning from high focus activities to the broader stimulation of the <br/>\nregular environment.

For example: I am not a fan of TV at all, it&#39;s <br/>\nboring for me and I didn&#39;t want our kids *wasting * their time with it too <br/>\nmuch. We were looking into the Waldorf School when they were really young. (they <br/>\nare 21, 12 1/2 and 11 now) We limited their TV time a lot. My sil&#39;s kids were <br/>\nin the Waldorf Schools for years and we began noticing that every time we saw <br/>\ntheir kids, on holidays or in the summer when we would all meet for vacation <br/>\nat my mil&#39;s summer home, all they wanted to do is watch TV. If the parents <br/>\nweren&#39;t around the kids went for it every chance they got and if the parents were <br/>\nthere it was always an issue for their whole family. Although we still had <br/>\nsome limits for the kids at that time, we slacked off a lot and the Waldorf idea <br/>\nwent out the window! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been unschooling and slowly incorporating RU into our lives for <br/>\nalmost 2 yrs. now. Our kids do watch TV, but at this point in their lives they <br/>\ncould really care less about it. It&#39;s just not a big deal to them any longer. <br/>\nThere are some days the TV is never even on, but that&#39;s their choice, not ours. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with the computer. It is on way more than the TV, but they know <br/>\nwhen they are tired/bored of it or their butts are getting sore from just <br/>\nsitting and they will go find other things to do all on their own. We don&#39;t need to <br/>\ntell them, they just do it on their own now. We&#39;ve noticed a big difference in <br/>\ntheir attitudes also. They seem much more happier, relaxed and confident in <br/>\nthemselves. I think they are more conscientious of their choices because *they <br/>\nknow* *they are* capable beings. *They know* because they are free to find <br/>\nout! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Computer Gaming and Young Kids","postDate":"1148447947","msgId":25935,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VORkRDQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1QTFDMUNCLTg5QTctNDcwRS1CNjk1LTlEMEE1NzFGRkMyRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25934,"nextInTopic":25943,"prevInTime":25934,"nextInTime":25936,"topicId":25933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They come down in the morning, begin playing, and<br/>\nit&#39;s hard even to interest them in meals. In addition to making it difficult<br/>\nfor her to get out of the house, the kids are usually screechy, hyperactive,<br/>\nand tweaky towards each other when they get off the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the evidence on developmental problems in young children is<br/>\ninconclusive and could easily be outweighed by the benefits, but I share her<br/>\nconcerns about the physical effects of this over the long run - ds5 has<br/>\nrecently complained about his legs and his wrist hurting.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect deschooling, but my conviction isn&#39;t deep. We have tried waving<br/>\nlots of alternative interests under their noses - no luck with ds5, who is<br/>\nthe more obsessed of the two. I also suspect that the computer provides a<br/>\nsafe haven for him against the age superiority of his older brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else experienced this sort of thing with their young (5ish) kids?<br/>\nAnd if so, how has it played out?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKen<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25937,"nextTopicId":25984}}
