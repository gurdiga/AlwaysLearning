I think you handled the situation beautifully.  I also think your son is very mature (regardless of the error in biting) and admitting his wrong and making amends for it is to be admired.  I am sorry the other mother is feeling a need to control your choices in mothering.  I think it might be coming from a place of powerlessness and realizing it is impossible to protect our young 24/7.  Unschooling/homeschooling/stay at home mom or not.  I hope her anger passes.  I don&#39;t think you did anything wrong.  You have every right to be the mother you want to be and to practice gentle discipline is odd to some people.  Just because the commonality of unschooling exists does not mean we parent or discipline the same way.  Anyway, hope peace returns to the relationship and you both get through this.  I think it would be wonderful to have a friend locally who unschools.

It is hard when you are that age.  I tried to be <br/>\nreally close to the boys when they were younger to help with mediation, help <br/>\nthem to reach compromises they both could live with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t quite understand how it happened.  Was it your sons toy? <br/>\n<br/>\n With my boys if it is their toy I do not make them share.  They share if <br/>\nthey want to.  IF not we can usually find something else for another child to <br/>\nplay with that my son does agree to share.  I mean it is his toy after all.  And <br/>\nI have seen as they get older they are more and more willing to share.  If <br/>\nthey do have toys they don&#39;t want played with for one reason or another then we <br/>\nput them away before company comes over so that nothing gets broken or <br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts, and I do agree with you and punishment is not the best <br/>\navailable to parents and we do not use punishment either.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"mozafamily","from":"&quot;mozafamily&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I could really use some input on this...

I think it <br/>\nwas partially because he had just been to the dentist that day and <br/>\neveryone seemed to be examining his teeth that day plus he has 2 new <br/>\nteeth (molars) coming in the back of his mouth, I think he was just <br/>\non teeth overload for the day! He hasn&#39;t ever bit anyone that hard <br/>\nbefore (left bruses but didn&#39;t break the skin) and hasn&#39;t bitten at <br/>\nall for probably 2-3 years - he never was prone to it! So all us <br/>\nparents saw it and after it happened my ds went and hid - to me <br/>\nobviously showing he had lost control and didn&#39;t know the correct <br/>\nthing to do. So we all comforted the hurt child and later after they <br/>\nleft and my ds had calmed down we talked briefly about it - but it <br/>\nwas prettymuch him who was saying something like &quot;I know I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave bit him and I&#39;ll try harder to be more patient next time, etc.&quot; <br/>\nI really felt like he knew he made a mistake and didn&#39;t need much <br/>\nfrom us to help him correct himself, that he had it under control. <br/>\nToday he appologized to the other child for hurting him - on his <br/>\nown - no prodding from me at all! So I felt like everything was <br/>\nsettled, that he learned something and was moving on. BUT the other <br/>\nparent today asks me why wasn&#39;t anything &quot;done&quot; to my child because <br/>\nhe behaved that way, this is supposedly another &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nparent! I explained that nothing needed to be &quot;done&quot;, that children <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to be humiliated (like say sorry right then) or suffer <br/>\npunishment, that he understood what he did and why it was wrong and <br/>\nthat &quot;he&quot; was working on it. Then of course she asked if anything <br/>\nis &quot;done&quot; to her son when he&#39;s in my care? And so I explained again <br/>\nthat I no longer believe in humiliating or punishing children (or <br/>\ntime outs either), if her child was out of control that I would help <br/>\nhim as much as I could and may remove him from an overwhelming <br/>\nenvironment. So I would really like some feedback on if I did the <br/>\nright thing here - I was finally feeling like I was getting the <br/>\ncorrect &quot;ideas&quot; of this &quot;unschooling or Life Learning&quot;, that it was <br/>\nstarting to make sense to me, and my son is so much happier than he <br/>\nwas in school, but now that my closest &quot;unschooling&quot; friend is <br/>\nquestioning me so I feel confused again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19425,"nextTopicId":19405}}
