I found an interesting definition.  When you find a  <br/>\ndefinition with a problem or a paradox or oddity, it might be worth  <br/>\ntalking about it--not in a critical or AHA! way.  Not like the authors  <br/>\nwere stupid.  But in light of the fact that language makes definitions  <br/>\ndifficult, and the details and angles of talking about anything will  <br/>\nalways open up another topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\nTack is a term used to describe any of the various equipment and  <br/>\naccessories worn by horses in the course of their use as domesticated  <br/>\nanimals. Saddles, stirrups, bridles, halters, reins, bits, harnesses,  <br/>\nmartingales, and breastplates are all forms of horse tack. Equipping a  <br/>\nhorse is often referred to as tacking up.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\nOf that first line, I immediately wondered what they were thinking  <br/>\nhorses might have worn when they weren&#39;t domesticated animals, or  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s being excepted here because it&#39;s only worn by wild horses and  <br/>\nso isn&#39;t &quot;tack.&quot;  I&#39;m picturing the wild horse herds dressing up for  <br/>\nMay Day or the first day of snow, and thinking of all the little girls  <br/>\nand all the My Little Ponies and Breyer horses in the whole world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not that horses &quot;wear&quot; tack any more than  <br/>\nbeds &quot;wear&quot; bedclothes.  So the problematical concept there isn&#39;t  <br/>\ndomestication, but the term &quot;worn.&quot;  And that gets into species  <br/>\nslavery or something very philosophical.  Horses don&#39;t &quot;wear&quot; anything  <br/>\ntheir owners don&#39;t inflict upon them, sometimes with the extreme  <br/>\nobjection of the horse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tack is the stuff people put onto horses for one reason or  <br/>\nanother.   But that&#39;s not true either, because if a horse wears  <br/>\nribbons braided into its mane, that&#39;s neither natural of wild horses  <br/>\nnor is it &quot;tack.&quot;  So somewhere in there tack ends and the My Little  <br/>\nPony girls begin again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48153,"nextTopicId":47952}}
