Thus, any compulsion or coercion interferes with learning. <br/>\nAnd, if education is a priority than it must be a priority for <br/>\nparents to facilitate learning in a non-coercive manner. And that non-<br/>\ncoersion must be utilized in ALL spheres of life or else the <br/>\ncompulsion used at any time damages the intrinsic motivation that <br/>\ndrives child-led learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe TCS philosophy maintains that it is a contradiction to embrace <br/>\nthat education and child-led learning are a priority but utilize <br/>\ncompulsion in other spheres of life because learning can only occur <br/>\nintrinsically. Only one process can occur at once: either an <br/>\nintrinsic priority or extrinsic priority. <br/>\n<br/>\nThus child-led learning must presume that the child is intrinsically <br/>\nmotivated ALL OF THE TIME. Any compulsion is extrinsic. One can not <br/>\nlearn while being force to do something they do not want to do. One <br/>\ncan not learn extrinsically. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne must choose whether learning (intrinsic) is the priority in <br/>\nparenting or making your child do what you want him to do <br/>\n(extrinsic). Because a child does learn that people can make them do <br/>\nthings if compulsion is used. I prefer my son to remain intrinsically <br/>\nmotivated and know that he has a right to liberty and non-coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne may choose that obedience, mandatory sharing of family <br/>\nresponsibilities, or religious devotion,etc. is your priority over <br/>\nyour child&#39;s education. But know that this extrinsic priority does <br/>\ninterfere with the process of intrinsic learning because these are <br/>\nexternal priorities of the parents. A child may choose to embrace <br/>\n(intrinsic) these priorities for himself but can not be made <br/>\n(extrinsic) to value them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, both child-led learning and family harmony can co-exist when <br/>\nconsensual relationships are the priority. Philosophy/principles do <br/>\nmake a difference. Depending on what philosophy one chooses to <br/>\nembrace, actions and choices are easier to put in perspective of the <br/>\nunique set of variables that every choice provides. Philosophy is <br/>\nthe &quot;why&quot; we choose this way or that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a philosophy about child-led learning. There are <br/>\nbroader philosophies that incorporate the philosophies of both <br/>\nunschooling and TCS. Consensual living is broader than just an <br/>\neducational philosophy.
