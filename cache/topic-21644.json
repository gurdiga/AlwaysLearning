How will I know when<br/>\nI am qualified to begin Unschooling? How do I graduate from the course? What<br/>\nare the standards for completion?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is somewhat along the lines of some of the books, like &quot;Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook&quot; - great for absolute beginners, but if you hang around here long<br/>\nenough you get it all for free and mostly from the same writers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI would consider, for *me*, a course like that might have become a detour in<br/>\nmy personal deschooling process, a safety net that was actually more like a<br/>\nspider&#39;s web.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
