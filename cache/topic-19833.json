Torrey Pines Dr.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot an unschooling conference, a variety show of homeschooling topics.  The <br/>\nway it&#39;s set up (seems to be) is that each particular homeschooling group there <br/>\nis sponsoring a speaker.   I&#39;m sponsored by Las Vegas Life Learners, a new <br/>\nunschooling group there.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOther people I know to be on the unschooling side of life are Connie Colten;<br/>\nand Elissa Wahl who&#39;s one of the authors of Christian unschooling; and <br/>\nSteve and Kimberly Patrow who used to live in Albuquerque and were active in <br/>\nThe Goof Group, a weekly unschooling group we used to have here when Kirby and <br/>\nMarty were younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther workshop and presentation descriptions are about control and biblical <br/>\nmandates and other things I have no interest in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an HSLDA guy.<br/>\nThe main speaker is Reb Bradley, who seems to be a preacher more than <br/>\nanything else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things Holly might like, though.   I hope she has fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then on Sunday the unschooling group is going to get together for a <br/>\npicnic or barbecue and then we can REALLY talk about unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe arrangements for this were fairly recent, but I wish I had put a notice <br/>\nhere sooner.  I kept forgetting.  And it&#39;s not a conference to really invite <br/>\ndoubting spouses or parents to.  I could be in for some flak or criticism, and <br/>\nno doubt there will be a room full of revisionist propaganda and advice for <br/>\nkeeping kids down and small.   I will be a threat to the idea that of course <br/>\nparents have to make kids learn  (etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- at the door it will be $25/single and $35/family-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much just to hear the unschoolers, I think. But I&#39;m glad to get to meet <br/>\nmore unschoolers and maybe help them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19830,"nextTopicId":19818}}
