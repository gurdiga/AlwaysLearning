(I haven&#39;t read it yet, but I&#39;m planning to pick up a copy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had some thoughts this week about how books and school change us over <br/>\nfrom learning from experience, to learning from someone else&#39;s <br/>\nexperience put down on paper.  (Before that I suppose common knowledge <br/>\nwas passed in songs and poems as well as being demonstrated.)  When most <br/>\nexperience came from learning, it makes sense that elders would be <br/>\nconsidered the wisest people in the tribe, as they would likely have had <br/>\nthe most experiences to learn from.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderneath this all, I think I&#39;m chewing on the idea that adults often <br/>\ncan&#39;t pass their own experiences to their teenagers, meaningfully, via <br/>\nlectures.  (About safe driving, or not taking drugs, using birth <br/>\ncontrol.)  This is a truism that I&#39;ve come across anecdotally and in <br/>\nnovels.  It makes me wonder whether &quot;learning&quot; from hearing someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s story is always a shallow kind of learning, or whether there is a <br/>\nstage in life where learning from hearing other people yap about <br/>\nsomething is especially ineffective.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, when we urge new people to meet real unschoolers and come to <br/>\nunschooling conferences, we are promoting getting closer to experiencing <br/>\nunschooling and getting away from lecturing people about it.  Also, <br/>\nsaying &quot;just do it&quot; is a nudge in the direction on experiential learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n**&quot;Our entire educational effort seems to be dedicated to making others over<br/>\nin our image, turning out carbon-copy people who faithfully reproduce all<br/>\nour mistakes.  &quot;Better,&quot; we seem to be saying, &quot;a poor imitation of<br/>\nourselves, than something different, something threatening.&quot;  An eminent<br/>\nchild psychologist sums up Nadia&#39;s case by concluding that if the loss of<br/>\nher gist is &quot;this price that must be paid for language - even just enough<br/>\nlanguage o bring her into some kind of community of discourse with her<br/>\nsmall protected world - we must, I think, be prepared to pay that price on<br/>\nNadia&#39;s behalf.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMust we?  I am far from convinced.  I value language very highly, but not<br/>\nabove all else.

One can not <br/>\nteach unschooling anymore than one can teach life. One can model <br/>\nliving life and model living unschooling. Everyone has their own <br/>\ndefinition of life and unschooling. Perhaps I am wrong and there is <br/>\nonly one absolute way to unschool. Then we would need a teacher. lol <br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think this contradiction is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can guide, facilitate, nurture and perhaps become a trusted <br/>\nadvisor, but one can not assume that their way to teach life or <br/>\nunschooling is the only way that unschooling can or should be <br/>\nmodeled. Limiting other&#39;s paths of unschooling obstructs people from <br/>\nchoosing what one wants or needs to learn about unschooling. Just as <br/>\nlimiting access to TV interferes with one learning personal <br/>\ndiscretion, limiting another&#39;s opinion of unschooling limits learning <br/>\nhow to live unschooling. The locus of control continues to reside <br/>\nwith the teacher rather than with the student, no differently than at <br/>\nschool. Unless one is going to the school of unschooling. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOne does not have to choose to facilitate in an optimal way. But <br/>\nisn&#39;t it the student who must decide what is optimal for himself, <br/>\nrather than the teacher? Isn&#39;t that the point of unschooling? But one <br/>\ncan choose not to facilitate also. But then what a loss for <br/>\nboth &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot;. Perhaps purging ourselves of these <br/>\nconstructs of teacher and student is truly the key to unschooling and <br/>\nlifelong learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Genant2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/14/04 11:18:29 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; scubamama@e... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe you CAN teach old dogs new tricks. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or maybe an old dog can learn a new trick if he wants or needs to.<br/>\n&gt; Pam G<br/>\n&gt; ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling defined","postDate":"1092500676","msgId":20292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMC4yODgyMmE1Ny4yZTRmOTZjNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20291,"nextInTopic":20293,"prevInTime":20291,"nextInTime":20293,"topicId":4047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/14/2004 12:16:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Genant2@aol.com writes: Some  will ask questions and want to talk about unschooling but will","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-629213611\">In a message dated 8/14/2004 12:16:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome  will ask questions and want to talk <br/>\nabout unschooling but will then turn  around and say &quot;my child could never <br/>\nunschool, she is just not motivated  to learn math&quot;.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOr worse: &quot;She is just not motivated to learn *anything*!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve hear THAT!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unschooling defined","postDate":"1092498364","msgId":20291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjVmYWRiNTI5LjJlNGY4ZGJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":20290,"nextInTopic":20292,"prevInTime":20290,"nextInTime":20292,"topicId":4047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/14/04 11:25:49 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

At least not here. If you&#39;re talking about the world out<br/>\nthere where unschooling is undefined, I don&#39;t see anything productive that<br/>\ncan come of discussing it since there isn&#39;t any one influence that&#39;s causing<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally newbies come in to the message boards and want a quick answer<br/>\nto what unschooling is and it does get defined -- generally in a variety of<br/>\nways. But they&#39;re told the best way to understand unschooling is to read the<br/>\nmessage board. The message board is full of personal stories, discussion,<br/>\ndays in the life.  All the things you say you&#39;d rather see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think, though,<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;d rather see unschooling unfold naturally in people&#39;s lives,<br/>\n&gt; even if it takes longer, than emerge from a struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the idea is pretty. I think if unschooling were for each individual,<br/>\nlike enlightenment, then they could spend a lifetime working at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if everyone had a neighbor who radiated patience and glorious<br/>\nfree kids, that people could come to unschooling naturally. They could see a<br/>\nliving example of something valuable that could counteract the message that<br/>\nthe only road worth travelling is the road to success.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut people don&#39;t. Most are surrounded by a school mindset on the fast track<br/>\nto success.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheories are good. But testing them out in practice is even better. Why<br/>\ndon&#39;t you get onto the Unschooling.com message board and put some of your<br/>\ntheories into practice with the newbies? There are some nurturing hand<br/>\nholders there :-) (AnneO comes to mind.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The natural learning potential of human children is truly amazing.<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine how a parent could watch that and not step<br/>\n&gt; back, awed and humbled by how well it works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get a hit of that, and everything else follows naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they do. In droves. Most parents are right there from the beginning,<br/>\nwatching their kids absorb life. But there&#39;s just too much certainty around<br/>\nthem that that is a sweet, innocent time, but it&#39;s not enough for the<br/>\nfuture. I&#39;ve heard far too many reports of people flabbergasted that some<br/>\nkids aren&#39;t in preschool. (&quot;They&#39;ll be handicapped in school if they don&#39;t<br/>\nget a head start!&quot; (Behind already at 3.)) And parents believe that message<br/>\nover the messages that say it&#39;s okay to slow down. But it&#39;s just too scary<br/>\nto slow down. Their kids&#39; lives are at stake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what you&#39;re envisioning isn&#39;t unschooling. I think it&#39;s something<br/>\ngood, encouraging people to tune out the noise and listen to their hearts.<br/>\nBut how far from their comfort zones would their hearts allow them to go<br/>\nwithout a model that&#39;s way past their comfort zone?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we all need to be radical feminists to find a free and happy life? No. We<br/>\ncan (to some extent) unfold naturally to be who we are. But how far could we<br/>\nunfold if the radical feminists hadn&#39;t pushed the envelope as far as they<br/>\ndid? If there hadn&#39;t been people saying &quot;That&#39;s not respectful!&quot; our vision<br/>\nof respectful would still be men taking care of women.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you underestimate the capacity of society to create rules, and the<br/>\ncapacity of people to like rules to follow. Unless there&#39;s a radical element<br/>\nthat keeps reminding people that those rules aren&#39;t necessary, people tend<br/>\nto be drawn to rules rather than doing what they think is best.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling defined","postDate":"1012772278","msgId":4072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNTAwMWMxYWNmYiQwZDAzYjRjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PDlmLjIyMjM5MmEzLjI5OGVlZGFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4068,"nextInTopic":4084,"prevInTime":4071,"nextInTime":4073,"topicId":4047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: SandraDodd@aol.com ...

When Sandra explained that for her type of unschooling [you can debate whether there are other types]learning is a priority, I knew I could adopt this philosophy and never worry about unschooling again.  Homes where learning is not a priority will unschool differently than homes where it is.  I think it is these priorities that change the look of unschooling from family to family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concern over being a coersive parent could be eliminated when there are defined family values or priorities.  High on my family&#39;s list of priorities or values would be, spending time together as a family, immediate as well as extended; a love of learning; kindness and consideration to others; honesty and integrity; and good manners ie. please, thank you, eating with mouth closed, etc.  Discussions of these values would be common and weight along these areas would be given when making decisions cooperatively.  *IMHO* those that feel that is it too coersive to express family values openly fall more in line with the philosophy of &quot;Non-Coersive Parenting&quot; than &quot;Unschooling&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling defined","postDate":"1012768334","msgId":4068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1ZC44NWU5OTM0LjI5OGVmODRlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4064,"nextInTopic":4072,"prevInTime":4067,"nextInTime":4069,"topicId":4047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/3/02 1:22:13 PM, heather@madrone.com writes:  If it can t be defined, what is the task of those who choose to help others ...

It&#39;s easy, however, to carry the<br/>\n&gt; concept of child-led to the point where it hampers the contribution<br/>\n&gt; of parents.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with that.  I never liked &quot;child-led&quot; because it causes people to <br/>\n&gt; seem to think there are two ways:  parent-led or child-led.

It feels <br/>\nopen for a bunch of different things to be happening - - such as - kids <br/>\nlearning just by following their own interests with no intervention by <br/>\nadults, kids asking adults to help them pursue an interest, parents noticing <br/>\ntheir kids&#39; interests and facilitating in ways the the kids might not know <br/>\nare possible (museums, resources, movies, music, ideas, people, etc), parents <br/>\noffering/suggesting things they think might be of interest to the kids, <br/>\nparents pursuing their own interests and the kids getting caught up in them <br/>\ntoo, parents pursuing their own interests that the kids are not interested in <br/>\nbut it does provide a model for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20272,"nextTopicId":20303}}
