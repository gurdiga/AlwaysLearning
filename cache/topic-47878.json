We used to let noon be the time people didn&#39;t have to be  <br/>\nquiet anymore, but as the kids got older, sometimes someone was  <br/>\nsleeping because they didn&#39;t feel well or they were working very late,  <br/>\nand noon was abandoned as a magic noise-making time.

And  <br/>\nso the principle here was &quot;sleeping is important and people should  <br/>\nsleep when they want to,&quot; but that didn&#39;t trump the more important  <br/>\nprinciple that the children should not be left to fend for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps (just guessing, or throwing out a possibility) if a child has  <br/>\noften been awakened when she&#39;s not ready, or if the dad hasn&#39;t been  <br/>\nable to sleep as long as he wanted to at least a couple of times a  <br/>\nweek, they would be less likely to help or allow a mom to sleep.    <br/>\nConversely, if the mom is generous they will be too (eventually; not  <br/>\nright that day).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337265206,"authorName":"bradj","from":"&quot;bradj&quot; &lt;bhmjones@...&gt;","profile":"bhmjones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Waking people up, unrealistic expectations?","postDate":"1255279069","msgId":47890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhdDFrdCtoMnFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhczF1aCtocGVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47889,"nextInTopic":47892,"prevInTime":47889,"nextInTime":47891,"topicId":47878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The problem for me was that  <br/>\nif she woke up naturally and heard me, I&#39;d still get a spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s unrealistic for a mother to want to sleep in the daytime  <br/>\nwhen she has small children.  When mine were little there were times I  <br/>\nfell asleep on the couch while they were playing in the living room,  <br/>\nor I would fall asleep with them when they napped and they would wake  <br/>\nup first and go do something.  That&#39;s not ideal, but sometimes it  <br/>\ncan&#39;t be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I didn&#39;t do would be to take a nap and expect them to take care  <br/>\nof themselves and not wake me up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could hire a neighbor to come and play with your child  <br/>\nquietly.  When Holly was born, a twelve year old girl followed us in  <br/>\nwhen we came back from the hospital, hoping to see the new baby.  Her  <br/>\nfamily had just moved to our street and they were Christian  <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  Her mom expected this girl to play with and take care  <br/>\nof her two younger sisters all the time and she was eager to get out  <br/>\nfrom that, so I used to pay her $3 an hour to come and take care of  <br/>\nKirby and Marty while Holly and I slept.  That was a win/win  <br/>\nsituation.  Maybe there&#39;s a homeschooler too young for a real job that  <br/>\nyou could hire to change games, get snacks, and answer the questions  <br/>\nof your kids for a few hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116805583,"authorName":"lindsey_osterloh","from":"&quot;lindsey_osterloh&quot; &lt;lao80@...&gt;","profile":"lindsey_osterloh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Waking people up, unrealistic expectations?","postDate":"1255185865","msgId":47878,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhcTZrOStwOGoyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47879,"prevInTime":47877,"nextInTime":47879,"topicId":47878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter Ramsey is 5 years old and wakes people up constantly for any reason.

She has activities and food avaliable if she wakes up first in the morning.  Still she will wake people up to ask a question, play a different game, want a different food.  If you take a nap during the day she will wake up you.  A few weekends ago I was sick and my husband was home and she woke me up during a 3 hour nap 4 times.  She will do it if it&#39;s one parent home or two.  If one is awake or both or asleep.
