I was with another adult friend of mine who had been living in another state and didn&#39;t know my kids very well.  Kirby had borrowed the car keys to get something from the van, and brought them back to me, but I asked him to put them in my basket, about eight feet from where I was standing.  He kind of slumped and showed the great difficulty of complying with that request, and my friend said &quot;Would you like some cheese with that whine?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby stood back up while looking my friend (Cathyn, for those who know him) down face to foot, and back up to his face and said:  &quot;Would *you* be cutting it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOH MY GOD, it was so wonderfully timed and presented that I took the keys and Cathyn bowed to him and complimented him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I asked Kirby where he had heard that, whether it was a quote from a movie or something, but no, he came up with it on the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, Holly had a bunch of friends over (oh, probably her birthday, so November) and we were playing Wise and Otherwise, which is like playing dictionary--you make something plausible up to bluff.  Some of us played it at SUSS, and some at the ALL Unschooling Symposium.  But each player completes a proverb from some culture or other.  This was &quot;there is an old West African saying&quot; (I think it was):  The king is like...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were eight or ten players--a good number.  Holly wrote &quot;...famous and stuff.&quot;  (The king is like famous and stuff.)<br/>\nA friend of hers wrote &quot;The king is like a monkey in a piñata.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t forget that image.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wanted to say, for parents who wonder about their child learning to write, that they should think more about their opportunities to play with language in amusing, fun, but real-life ways, than about whether they can &quot;compose a sentence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to collect some examples of tiny little writings, incidental texts, jokes, role-playing jewels on a page called <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/language/shortbursts\">http://sandradodd.com/language/shortbursts</a><br/>\n(If you go there now, it will be a mess, but someday it might not be.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65799,"nextTopicId":65804}}
