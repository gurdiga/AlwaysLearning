(Welcome!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPending members are now asked to reply to an email that describes the purpose of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut apparently not everyone sees the email. So if you got onto the list without seeing it, please do read below. It seems it has helped new members understand the list better.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust read! DON&#39;T REPLY Yes or No. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Always Learning list is DIFFERENT! Please read and reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike most unschooling lists, the Always Learning list digs into the inner workings of parenting practices. List discussion focuses on what helps and hinders learning and relationships. <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who posts -- whether a question or a reply -- should want to see their ideas analyzed under an unschooling light. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list thrives on unschooling questions and discussion! :-) But it&#39;s also perfectly okay to sit back and follow the discussion. (All new members are encouraged to do just that for awhile to get a feel for the list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany find the analysis helps them clear out hidden baggage, think more clearly and become the radical unschooling parents they want to be. Some find it uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Always Learning sounds like a list you&#39;d like to try reply &quot;Yes&quot;. If not, reply &quot;No,&quot; and best wishes in your unschooling and finding a list that fits your unschooling needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72841,"nextTopicId":72882}}
