I am going to work on moving there within the next <br/>\n&gt; year.  <br/>\n&gt; I have felt restless and unsatisfied (a bit like always having one <br/>\n&gt; foot out the door) this past year living here in Paradise.  I have <br/>\n&gt; met very few unschoolers (2 to be exact, and one of those is in <br/>\n&gt; Chico) and not a decent single man in sight &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; I found the people there to be friendly and welcoming.  There is a <br/>\n&gt; lot of &#39;alternative&#39; stuff going on (medicine, enviromentalism, <br/>\n&gt; music, spirituality, etc.), that I am interested in.
