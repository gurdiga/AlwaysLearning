Not too many people need to think in other<br/>\nbases during the course of daily life so the explanations, just as in<br/>\nschool, go in but don&#39;t have anything to stick to os eventually fade away.<br/>\nAs far as I know the only people who put bases to practical use are computer<br/>\nscientists.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *can* lead to an &quot;aha&quot; moment of why numbers are represented the way they<br/>\nare for some people. And for others it can just be a lot of seemingly<br/>\nuseless mathematical noise. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn base 3 2+2 would equal 11.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut calling it base &quot;3&quot; is confusing since there wouldn&#39;t be a single digit<br/>\nfor three. It would be represented as 1 followed by a 0 meaning 1 set of<br/>\nthree and 0 sets of units. So counting in base 3 would go:<br/>\n<br/>\n01<br/>\n02<br/>\n10<br/>\n11<br/>\n12<br/>\n20<br/>\n21<br/>\n22<br/>\n100<br/>\n101 &lt;- that represents 1 set of 3x3 and 1 set of units or 10 in base ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nand so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo 1202 would represent:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 set of 3x3x3 = 27<br/>\n2 sets of 3x3 = 18<br/>\n0 sets of 3 = 0<br/>\n2 sets of 1&#39;s = 2<br/>\nwhich all adds up to and is 47 in base 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn base 4 2+2 would equal 10. (1 set of 4 and 0 sets of units.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn base 5 and all bases above 2+2 would equal 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any base the columns represent how many of that power of that number you<br/>\nhave so:<br/>\n<br/>\n2345 in base 10 is:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 x 10x10x10 (10 to the 3rd power which I would write as 10 with a 3 up in<br/>\nthe air if I could!)<br/>\n3 x 10x10    (10 to the 2nd power)<br/>\n4 x 10       (10 to the 1st power)<br/>\n5 x 1        (10 to the 0th power)<br/>\n<br/>\n2345 in base 8 is<br/>\n<br/>\n2 x 8x8x8 = 2 x 512 = 1024<br/>\n3 x 8x8   = 3 x 64  =  192<br/>\n4 x 8     = 4 x 8   =   32<br/>\n5 x 1     = 5 x 1   =    5<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich in base 10 is 1253.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you write down a number you&#39;re doing addition, multiplication and<br/>\npowers :-) In fact when you write down money, you&#39;re using negative powers:<br/>\n<br/>\n$1.67 is<br/>\n<br/>\n1 x 1   (10 to the 0th power)<br/>\n6 x .1  (10 to the -1 power)<br/>\n7 x .01 (10 to the -2 power)<br/>\n<br/>\nThings get interesting in bases above 10 since we don&#39;t have single digits<br/>\nfor numbers above 9. As far as I know, the only base that gets used is base<br/>\n16 for computer work and computer scientists use letters:<br/>\n<br/>\nbase 8  base 10<br/>\n1    =    1<br/>\n2    =    2<br/>\n3    =    3<br/>\n4    =    4<br/>\n5    =    5<br/>\n6    =    6<br/>\n7    =    7<br/>\n8    =    8<br/>\n9    =    9<br/>\n0A    =    10<br/>\n0B    =    11<br/>\n0C    =    12<br/>\n0D    =    13<br/>\n0E    =    14<br/>\n0F    =    15<br/>\n10    =    16<br/>\n11    =    17<br/>\n12    =    18<br/>\n13    =    19<br/>\n14    =    20<br/>\n15    =    21<br/>\n16    =    22<br/>\n17    =    23<br/>\n18    =    24<br/>\n19    =    25<br/>\n1A    =    26<br/>\n1B    =    27<br/>\n<br/>\nand so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in base 16 8+8 is 10. (1 set of 16 and zero units.)<br/>\nA+A = 14 (10+10 = 1 set of 16 plus 4 sets of units)<br/>\nD+D = 1A (13+13 = 1 set of 16 plus 10 sets of units)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is curious why anyone would want to do such nonsense, it&#39;s because<br/>\ncomputers at one time sent information in chunks of 16 bits. (You may have<br/>\nheard the term 16 bit addressing. I think they&#39;re up to 32 bit addressing<br/>\nnow.) Computers, of course, use base 2 arithmetic. (Each bit (physically a<br/>\nwire or some channel carrying electricity or, now, light) can only exist in<br/>\none of two states, either on or off, represented by 1 and 0). To talk about<br/>\na 16 bit number you need a string of 16 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. So to talk about a<br/>\nparticular location (address) in a computer, you&#39;d need to write out 16 1&#39;s<br/>\nand 0&#39;s. It&#39;s a lot easier to compress that into a single digit that not<br/>\nonly represents that string of 16 but can also be easily expanded back into<br/>\nthe string of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is probably way more than anyone wanted to know ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":689589,"authorName":"KT","from":"KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 353","postDate":"1021057067","msgId":6849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDREMxODJCLjQwNzAzMDBAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjEwMDY1NTUuNDAxLjI4ODYwLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6869,"prevInTime":6848,"nextInTime":6850,"topicId":6849,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
