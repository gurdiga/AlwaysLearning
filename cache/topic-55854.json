Regularly.  I was thinking  <br/>\nof doing another round, and found this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you think everyone around you is judging you, than maybe you  <br/>\nshould look at how you judge everyone around you and stop doing it.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s that simple.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was on the facebook page of the dad of an unschooling family I&#39;ve  <br/>\nknown since before we were unschooling.  He has no idea that in the  <br/>\npast day on this list two people have said &quot;not judging, but...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI *Know* people are judging me all the time.  It&#39;s part of thought.    <br/>\nPeople are deciding whether I&#39;m for real, one way or another.  Whether  <br/>\nI should be invited to play board games with them.  Whether I&#39;m a good  <br/>\nperson to confide in about something burning and current.  Whether I  <br/>\ncould go to Walgreen&#39;s and get shampoo for them (friend has a broken  <br/>\nleg; I&#39;ve had two broken legs, so she knew I&#39;d be sympathetic!!).   <br/>\nWhether I suck.  Whether I&#39;m wonderful.  Whether I made their marriage  <br/>\nbetter, or whether they&#39;ve decided to e-mail me and say that I&#39;ve  <br/>\nprobably done more damage to new unschooling families than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to accept the positive things, or the fun things, and reject  <br/>\nthe negative parts with &quot;I&#39;m feeling judged,&quot; how would that make the  <br/>\npositive things more sensible?   And that&#39;s not to say that I  <br/>\nindiscriminately consider them all equally thoughtful and valid.   <br/>\nSomeone might ask my advice more for a photo op or because mine&#39;s the  <br/>\nfirst e-mail address she found, than that she has thought carefully  <br/>\nand thinks I would be the best for her in her situation.   Some of  <br/>\nthose who have insulted me as hard as they could later came around and  <br/>\napologized.   So many have done that, in fact, that now when someone  <br/>\ngoes ape shit early on I tend to file them under &quot;Might come around  <br/>\nand apologize later&quot; in my head rather than writing them off as never  <br/>\ngoing to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could call those who said nice things &quot;right; smart; good&quot; and those  <br/>\nwho didn&#39;t like me &quot;wrong and bad.&quot;  There&#39;s the evidence for the  <br/>\noriginal quote up top that feeling judged involves making a judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55844,"nextTopicId":55658}}
