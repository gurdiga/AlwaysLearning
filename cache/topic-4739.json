I&#39;m<br/>\ncurious now, but I can&#39;t afford the time to search anymore since it&#39;s not<br/>\ninformation that I really need at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the articles I ran across while searching said that before hair<br/>\ndryers, some parlors used to have women put their heads on the window sill<br/>\nand let their hair hang down outside in the breeze to dry. They&#39;d switch<br/>\ntheir position every once in awhile to dry all sides. People walking by<br/>\ncould often tell who&#39;s hair was being washed because they recognized the<br/>\ncolor. Hey! I could look up the history of hair dryers and salons would have<br/>\nto pre-date them. Back in a minute....<br/>\n<br/>\n.....I&#39;m back. Here&#39;s what I found:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In the early 1900&#39;s, it was quite common to walk down a street and see a<br/>\nlong length of hair hanging out the window. As there were no hair dryers in<br/>\nthose days, salons resorted to simply opening the window and offering their<br/>\nclient&#39;s a chair.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1920, the first true hair dryer came on the market, but it was extremely<br/>\nlarge and heavy, and frequently overheated. Handles were often made of<br/>\nwood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame information, but this time it came with dates. I think it&#39;s safe to say<br/>\nthat beauty parlors were around in 1910.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"duckfordu","from":"&quot;duckfordu&quot; &lt;SandraDodd@...&gt;","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Gooooooooogle","postDate":"1013634101","msgId":4771,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE0ZWs3bCttN2Q0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4OEZFNkQ1LjIyMUQ5JUZlbGljaXRhc0BNYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4756,"nextInTopic":4787,"prevInTime":4770,"nextInTime":4772,"topicId":4739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know where I read about the hair dryer!
