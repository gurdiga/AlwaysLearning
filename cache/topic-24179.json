Marty is  <br/>\nalso the kid of person who enjoys being alone.  He doesn&#39;t mind going  <br/>\nto a movie alone or eating alone.  I find that horribly sad and  <br/>\nWRONG, because I myself am needy. &lt;g&gt;  If I have to eat alone in  <br/>\npublic, the cost of the meal goes up $4 or so because if I don&#39;t have  <br/>\na book with me I will have to buy a magazine or I just cannot  <br/>\nphysically sit and eat.  I can get drive-through food, but still I  <br/>\nhave to read something (usually there&#39;s something in the car,  <br/>\nthough).  I have gone to movies alone twice in my life and both times  <br/>\nfelt pitifully alone and unloved.     Yeah, that is MY problem.    <br/>\nSomewhere back there in the depths of my childhood I defined myself  <br/>\nas &quot;right&quot; when I had a friend and &quot;loser&quot; when I wasn&#39;t with someone  <br/>\nelse, maybe.

So I see it as  <br/>\nfine in Keith (though it took a few years to really believe he wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nhiding that he was feeling like me) but I still worry that Marty  <br/>\nNEEDS more people.

My family is rather new to <br/>\nunschooling, but I must admit the idea has been nudging around in my <br/>\nbrain for a couple of years.  We are lovin&#39; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did want to hear some of your thoughts on one thing.  I have an 8 <br/>\nyear old son who has never been to school.  He is happily <br/>\nunschooling, with lots of interests including video gaming, reading, <br/>\nspontaneous role play acting, music, his animals and any number of <br/>\nother things.  He loves spending time playing and talking with his <br/>\ndad and I, and occasionally hangs out with some of the neighbor kids <br/>\nhis age or older.  He knows he is welcome to invite someone over <br/>\nanytime, and does this on occasion.  He did a lot more when he was 5-<br/>\n6 or so; a couple of kids ended up practically living at our house <br/>\nfor a year.  We have participated in some homeschooling activities <br/>\nover the past couple of years, mostly parties and bowling or roller <br/>\nskating type of activities.  He is now not interested in going, for <br/>\nthe most part, to any group-type things, no matter what the activity <br/>\nis.  I try to present them in a light manner, and accept his interest <br/>\nlevel (or lack of).  Yet I worry that he is not interacting with <br/>\nenough other people in the world.  (I know, what is &quot;enough&quot;?)  He is <br/>\nat ease socially with family, friends, and even new people we meet, <br/>\nno lack of social skills there.  We spend a lot of time at home, but <br/>\ndo go out on usually at least a weekly basis to the zoo or museums, <br/>\nnew restaurants, galleries, happenings around town....<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is happy.
