She doesn&#39;t want me to make it, although she said I may help. I&#39;ve been reading up on it for the past few days, and I&#39;m thinking the easiest way to go about it is probably to use pre-made rings, like jump rings for jewelry or maybe even key chain rings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we learned that it was often young children who linked the rings together, Noor became even more determined to make the &quot;real&quot; kind. I&#39;d previously suggested we cut some window screens or shelf-liner into a tunic, but she&#39;s pretty set on making something as authentic as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone made chain mail with young kids?
