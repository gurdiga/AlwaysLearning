I can remember hearing people in high school talk about one of the boys who had wet his pants in second grade! You couldn&#39;t escape what people thought they knew about who you were. I didn&#39;t have a clear sense of _how_ I wanted to be different, but I remember longing to get out of school because I knew I was ready to change and felt I couldn&#39;t do it surrounded by 250 classmates who&#39;d known me since elementary school and long since decided exactly who I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwice in my 20s I was visiting my home town and ran into people who had been at the bottom of the school pecking order. One was a girl who had been &quot;the fat girl&quot;--I remember the kids on the school bus chanting &quot;Orca! Orca!&quot; as she came down the path from her house to the bus.  She looked great--not thinner, but healthy and well-dressed and smiling, and she had a toddler and a baby with her. She was happily married and talked to me about how great things had gotten for her once she was out of school, how she&#39;d made friends, dated, found this man who thought she was wonderful, had these two kids she doted on. No guy in our school was going to think she was wonderful--and if he did, and acted on it, he&#39;d have been ostracized, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a similar conversation with the guy who had been absolutely the school scapegoat, the one universally considered to be such a loser that his name actually became something people could call each other as an insult, who&#39;d spent his 13 years in school being constantly bullied. Both of them were also taunted by teachers who seemed to have figured out that it was a good way to score points with the kids who mattered. I especially remember the gym teacher verbally humiliating Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all three of us--the two of them more than for me, I actually had a very successful high school experience from the outside, at least--being trapped in that setting was terrible. And even if you&#39;re not actively involved in bullying (I wasn&#39;t), you witness it, you feel that powerlessness to stop it, or, for kids who are brave enough to try, you invite your share of abuse. I remember feeling really ashamed because both Brad and Laura, when I ran into them years later, thanked me for always being nice to them. All I did was say hi to them in the halls and not call them &quot;spaz&quot; or &quot;fatso.&quot; I was ashamed all through school that I didn&#39;t do more. That they remembered me with gratitude when all I did was _not_ abuse them says something horrible about what their lives were like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat system hurts everybody who moves through it. At least, that&#39;s what I believe in my darker moods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] thumbsucking....","postDate":"1273335446","msgId":53944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRTU4RTk2LjYwOTA5MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwQzVFRjZDLTI1RDQtNDJBMy1BQ0IzLUE4Q0IzMTUzMEY0NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhya2w2NCtsZ3Q3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RkJBM0RCNjgtNzk3NC00QjI2LUEwNDgtREE3MjI3MDY1MzZEQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8eTJvNzljMWQxYjQxMDA1MDgwMTQ3cTU0YTYyNzkzeDE1N2M3NjE5MWI3ZDQ3ZTdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw1MEM1RUY2Qy0yNUQ0LTQyQTMtQUNCMy1BOENCMzE1MzBGNDRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53934,"nextInTopic":53972,"prevInTime":53943,"nextInTime":53945,"topicId":53716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What I did was took him to the doctor and got some medicine to help control his bladder for those sleepover nights. We also got an alarm that attaches to the underwear and goes off when it gets wet.

Helping a child be confident and resistent to <br/>\nbullying is fine, but trying to persuade them that they should just <br/>\nnot care what anyone thinks doesn&#39;t seem healthy.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I agree.  I think thumb sucking is different.  It&#39;s not a social taboo to suck ones thumb.  That&#39;s a case of kids being mean.  If this were my kid, I&#39;d handle it the same way I do nose picking, which IS a social taboo, IF my kid felt like he needed to stop sucking his thumb because he was being teased.  I&#39;d remind him to do it in private or not around those kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience, is that kids are brutal about thumb sucking.  It didn&#39;t make me dislike sucking my thumb any less, it made me feel like kids were mean.  I felt like I had to hide it and I didn&#39;t want to.  Sucking my thumb helped me think and work things through.  It was soothing.  Not all kids are mean about it.  If kids are being mean about it, it says a lot about those kids, that maybe they ARE mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux bit her nails from the time she was a baby just sprouting her front teeth all the way until about a month ago when she decided to stop doing it, she&#39;s 8 1/2.  There were times when she was younger that she asked for help to stop biting her nails.  Every time I saw her doing it, I reminded her, something she asked me to do.  It resulted in her hiding from me to do it.  I wasn&#39;t by any means nagging her, but when I realized she was hiding from me, I stopped reminding her and she stopped hiding it.  I personally didn&#39;t care whether or not she bit her nails.  No amount of me helping her actually got her to stop.  She stopped when she, herself, decided to stop and did so.  She clipped her nails for the first time since infancy about a week ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents decided that sucking my thumb was causing too much stress for me, dealing with teasing, and I imagine social pressure on them.  My experience is different from this kid, I didn&#39;t want to stop, I wanted other kids to stop being mean, so perhaps the outcome will be different.  My parents tried all the bad tasting stuff too.  I&#39;d sneak into the bathroom to wash it off and then proceed to suck it off.  It was mean, just as mean as the kids teasing me about it.  That&#39;s how I felt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d just say, that I&#39;d go about it gently.  He may still really want to suck his thumb, but not want to be ridiculed about it.  Maybe he could wear a cool glove when he hangs out with those kids, or a spiderman hand accessory.

I think both more talking in the line of, &quot;hey, if you enjoy sucking your thumb, then great!  We all have different things that bring us comfort.&quot;  And maybe figuring out things the child can say to the friends, should they see him do it and decide to bother him, which is likely.  I know a 60+ man who sucks his thumb when he watches TV FWIW.  SOunds like Jenny could&#39;ve used someone to stand up for her...but maybe this child really does need help fitting in the way he wants to. <br/>\n<br/>\n SO my question is:   Isn&#39;t it unsupportive of parents to &quot;support&quot; their children by saying &quot;No you don&#39;t need to stop because thumbsucking is just fine and let&#39;s tell those kids to shove it.&quot;  The subtext being: fitting in isn&#39;t what you really want and so I&#39;m here to tell you you don&#39;t actually know what you want.  That&#39;s the tricky part in my mind.  I&#39;m sure the child in this case might benefit from both.  But maybe he is clear with what he wants which is that although he sucks his thumb, he&#39;s ready to stop for personal reasons and he doesn&#39;t quite know how now so he has asked for help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many kids began reading because they were either pressured OR inspired by their peers?  Or anything else for that matter.  I think it&#39;s a bummer to change because of pressure, but the significant point seems to be that the child isn&#39;t changing because of pressure from family.  Even if my kids make decisions because of friends (or yucky friends), isn&#39;t it the support from me that will really help my children stay close to their born self-confidence?  I&#39;m not sure how I feel about trying to force my kids to feel immune to mainstream pressures.  If they feel pressure, as I sometimes do, I certainly want be there to give alternative input so they feel bolstered to make the decision that is closest to their hearts, whatever it may be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCary<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On May 2, 2010, at 12:52 PM, Ruthie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My son has asked me to support him in stopping sucking his thumb.   <br/>\n&gt; &gt; He is 6 and I have not pressured him to do this.
