What do you mean?...just a question from a mom who is starting to look for a work at home opportunity.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd, I&#39;m from Minnesoa...grew up in west central Minnesota, not far from Fargo-Moorhead.  And then as a new parent, I lived near St. Cloud.  I&#39;m in Virginia now...with mostly all of my relatives still residing back home.
