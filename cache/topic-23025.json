It was really<br/>\nnice to see how the words shared on this list made an impact on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all start unschooling in different places. This happens to be a group of<br/>\nmostly experienced unschoolers who often get right to the nitty gritty...for<br/>\nme this has been a huge gift, even when it was painful. If someone shares<br/>\nideas that are far from unschooling, the unschooling way of being with,<br/>\nlistening to, admiring, respecting, and completely giving to our children,<br/>\nthe ideas will be attacked. That is a good thing. It has little or nothing<br/>\nto do with the poster...the poster is an adult who hopefully will hear the<br/>\nmessage that will help the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for sharing your continued thinking.

Sometimes it&#39;s easy to fall into &quot;I have no choice.&quot;   But there&#39;s <br/>\nalways an if...then.    I &quot;have&quot; to do this if...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finishing a book.    I&#39;d like to have some ready to sell at the <br/>\nconference in early October.   I forced myself to work on it when I really didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto, because of the deadline I had imposed on my own self.   I could still <br/>\ndecide to blow it off.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI &quot;have to&quot; pack and organize and get some handouts together for the <br/>\nconference.   I &quot;have to&quot; get the rounds we&#39;re going to sing on paper.   But I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to.   I have choices.   I could go without handouts.   I could go less <br/>\nprepared than I&#39;d like to be.    And ultimately, I could blow off the whole thing <br/>\nand just decide not to go.   But I would be embarrassed and ashamed of having <br/>\nnot kept a commitment, and would spend WAY more of my reputation than I&#39;d be <br/>\nwilling to, and so because I&#39;ve made decisions and priorities, that&#39;s how I <br/>\ndecide what to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a mom&#39;s priority is housework, then children will come second.   If the <br/>\nchildren are the priority, housework comes second.   Most people haven&#39;t <br/>\nthought of it that way.   Without thinking of that it might seem that BOTH are <br/>\nequally important, but they&#39;re not.    <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery decision is a choice.   If we know what we hope to do, then   we can <br/>\nmake decisions based on that plan or priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sorry Sandra.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fine.
