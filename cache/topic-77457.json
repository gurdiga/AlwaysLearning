I believe that some foods ARE better for our health than others.  I’m not sure this is really empirically disputable.  However, what is interesting is that externally imparted knowledge and education seem to have such little bearing on what we actually choose to eat in our own lives.  <br>\n<br>\nMy sister is a nurse specialising in treatment of obesity and diabetes.  The government approach is all about education, education, education, and she spends her professional life educating people with real, compromising and sometimes life threatening health issues which could be significantly helped if they drastically changed their diet.  However, despite lots and lots of help and all the right information, most of her patients don’t change long term.  I’m so interested in why this is.  It seems a simple fix to an outsider - change your diet and save your life!!! But it just doesn’t work like that.<br>\n<br>\nI am starting to see how complicated our relationship with food is, and how external sources of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and being told what to do and eat by well-meaning parents, educators and professionals is pretty unlikely to have the ‘desired&#39; effect.  It seems food is tied up with a much more emotional part of our selves and that is why it seems important to me that food is treated with a light touch, with fun, humour, and delight where possible. All of it, all kinds of food.  The aforementioned sister was anorexic in her teens and bulemic in her 20’s.  She thankfully, at 40, is pretty sure that she is fully recovered and never wants her child or my children to know, but as a consequence we as a family have instinctively never talked about diets or judged food verbally as we are so aware where that can go, even before we knew about unschooling.  <br>\n<br>\nStill more interestingly, her anorexia seems not to have been triggered by food messages - our family was pretty relaxed about food - but by other things in her life that were not going well.<br>\n<br>\nI’m still not clear about how my kids will negotiate that field in their lives.  What their relationship with food will be like.  I can’t ‘make it right’ for them, I don’t know what the right thing to do or say or be is.  All I know is that I want to quietly choose joy, and bring choices, wherever the opportunity presents itself.  Do as little harm as possible. Light touch.

Trust grows when someone is trustworthy.  <br/>\nIf a child is too young to know whether the parent is worthy of trust, then what?  <br/>\nThis goes onto my list of things to add to my advanced unschooling ideas for Sunday.  I was already going to talk about trust, but this is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used an analogy in the past about there being a turd in the lemonade.  If there is lemonate that is clean, then it’s lemonade (either American lemonade which is thick and tart, or UK lemonade which is carbonated and light, like 7-Up without lime).   If there is a turn in there, then what?  Does it matter how big the turd is or who or what it came out of?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Yes, yes… there can be imperceptible fly turds.  Gnat turds.  No one would call those turds–they’re called “specks.”<br/>\nYes, yes about any other “yeah but” responses to picturing a turd in lemonade.]<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone lies sometimes, but not always, but sometimes she will state something as fact when it is not fact, then that is a turd in the lemonade.  How much of the rest of what she says will you “take to the bank”?  <br/>\nAnd if you know that someone lies 5% of the time, or 15%, and you’re not sure about the current statement, you will most likely NOT give it 85% or 95% credence.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to the mom and scare tactics or exaggerations or threats.  If the child has built up years and years of faith and trust in the mom and discovers she was dishonest about something, there is a turd in a LOT of years’ worth of lemonade then.  How much of the faith in the mom will spill out if the child angrily dismisses her opinion and goes against it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mom lies to keep a child from eating a cupcake, will the child later ask her advice about budding romance?  sexual relationships?  buying a car or a house?<br/>\nHow many cupcakes woud that mom be willing to share with that child later, if it would restore that trust?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cellulite","postDate":"1473853429","msgId":77489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3clpmaXlGQWJDNDA1b1JfTUNndldCTHdCSjgtV2NOVDl1ZD0yMEFPMmg9QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlGMjM5MkQxLUVDN0UtNDJBMS05REY0LUVCQUU0QjY1MDgyN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEMyNDQ0N0JDLThFQUMtNEQwRi04NUU5LTg3MDcyNDAzODY3NEBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDw5RjIzOTJEMS1FQzdFLTQyQTEtOURGNC1FQkFFNEI2NTA4MjdAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77487,"nextInTopic":77491,"prevInTime":77488,"nextInTime":77490,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This conversation reminds me of a complaint my mother had about the DARE program 30 years ago.

I was up to 160 from my usual 130.  <br/>\nI went for months.  Keith went once and wouldn’t go back.  He said the feeling of having an older woman tell him what to eat was too much.  His mom talked him talked him talked him his whole life.<br/>\nThough he has lost weight as an adult, he’s diabetic the last few years and they assigned him “an educator,” who has called him at home a few times.  So now it’s a female with a foreign accent who accosts him in his own home when he’s minding his own business.  This is not pleasant for him at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver 30 years, I gained weight, Keith lost weight.  When I go to a new doctor for a checkup or if I’m in somewhere where they don’t have a chart on me already, they seem disappointed (irritated) that my blood pressure is low and I’m not diabetic.  They would like to shame me.  They want to show me that I’m dying, but I’m not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPutting these kinds of pressure on young children under ANY circumstances can cause lifelong harm.<br/>\nAdding those kinds of pressures to unschooling can ruin unschooling (and cause lifelong harm).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the pressures aren’t always true, either.  The claims of “if you want to live” sound like that person has the power of life or death, and that you’re an idiot. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might possibly, Belinda, be part of why some people don’t want to change their diet when it seems that it’s to create success for “an educator.”<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-despite lots and lots of help and all the right information-=-<br/>\n“The right information” has changed many times just in my lifetime.<br/>\nAnd “lots and lots of help” is only helpful if the learner IS being helped.  <br/>\nThat model of lots of help and right information is just like school.

I believe that some foods ARE better for our health than others.  I’m not sure this is really empirically disputable.  However, what is interesting is that externally imparted knowledge and education seem to have such little bearing on what we actually choose to eat in our own lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister is a nurse specialising in treatment of obesity and diabetes.  The government approach is all about education, education, education, and she spends her professional life educating people with real, compromising and sometimes life threatening health issues which could be significantly helped if they drastically changed their diet.  However, despite lots and lots of help and all the right information, most of her patients don’t change long term.  I’m so interested in why this is.  It seems a simple fix to an outsider - change your diet and save your life!!! But it just doesn’t work like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to see how complicated our relationship with food is, and how external sources of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and being told what to do and eat by well-meaning parents, educators and professionals is pretty unlikely to have the ‘desired&#39; effect.  It seems food is tied up with a much more emotional part of our selves and that is why it seems important to me that food is treated with a light touch, with fun, humour, and delight where possible. All of it, all kinds of food.  The aforementioned sister was anorexic in her teens and bulemic in her 20’s.  She thankfully, at 40, is pretty sure that she is fully recovered and never wants her child or my children to know, but as a consequence we as a family have instinctively never talked about diets or judged food verbally as we are so aware where that can go, even before we knew about unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStill more interestingly, her anorexia seems not to have been triggered by food messages - our family was pretty relaxed about food - but by other things in her life that were not going well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m still not clear about how my kids will negotiate that field in their lives.  What their relationship with food will be like.  I can’t ‘make it right’ for them, I don’t know what the right thing to do or say or be is.  All I know is that I want to quietly choose joy, and bring choices, wherever the opportunity presents itself.  Do as little harm as possible. Light touch. No big deal :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":420468373,"authorName":"","from":"lisajceledon@...","profile":"lisajceledon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cellulite","postDate":"1473797504","msgId":77484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5yOW1pMCsxamVoM2Y1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5yN2p2Nitpb2IxNW1AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":77483,"nextInTopic":77486,"prevInTime":77483,"nextInTime":77485,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1654698452\">&lt;&lt;This understanding could only happen AFTER I let go of control and fear; after I let go of food labels based on my fears; after I chose peace and joy over shaming and self-righteousness.

What if someone stopped you from eating cows milk or rice or gluten or meat based on their “research” of what foods were bad?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou got to decide what’s valuable to you. You got to decide how much you’d give up for what you felt you were gaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’re robbing your children of the opportunity to decide what’s important to them. You’re taking away their ability to decide what is a benefit to them and what is worth giving up for it. You’re deciding for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf no one were eating fast food, it would be easy to convince them it’s poison. Children don’t need a lot of convincing that Drano is poison (once they understand poison.) No other kids are drinking Drano for fun and continuing on with their happy lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same is not true of McDonalds. People are happily eating McDonalds. It tastes good, especially to kids because it has lots of the calories their bodies burn up quickly in small packages that match the small size of their stomachs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they get older, kids *will* change their tastes. They’ll also become more conscious of bigger ideas and which ideas are most important to them. Like the planet, money, pesticides, cooking, eating a certain way and so on. They may pick up and drop several ideas throughout childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is learning, then your children feeling free to explore different ideas will be important to you. If you goal is protection, then that will get in the way of trying ideas out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it&#39;s also not fair to say someone who sees things differently<br/>\n&gt; has bought into propaganda. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but it’s pretty common that when someone has “done the research” it means they’ve read articles that confirm what they’re growing to believe. It’s called cherry picking. And confirmation bias. The writers of all those articles do it too. I hope not deliberately! But once you start looking for confirmation of what you fear is true, you’ll see it everywhere. The reports that refute the fear will seem like noise and anomalies. What happens is that all the articles that agree with your fear come to feel right. All the articles that disagree come to feel wrong. It doesn’t help that the anti-chemistry side paints anyone who disagrees with them as the enemy and in the pockets of big business. It effectively creates a protective bubble around what they write. It gets labeled The Truth. Then even objective writers get labeled, The Liars.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen all the issues are looked at without the fear colored glasses, it’s clear — especially to unschoolers — that if there are any dangers to our foods, they take a very very long time and a very off balance diet to have an effect. In other words, kids have time. Keeping kids away from “processed” foods is not an emergency. Kids have time to find the foods they like by trying. They can turn over information to decide what sounds right for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr they can unless a parent *tells* them this chemical is bad and this food is bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":426714371,"authorName":"Niki Rose","from":"Niki Rose &lt;niki.l.rose@...&gt;","profile":"niki.rose@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cellulite","postDate":"1473746850","msgId":77482,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK1dYZHl5UjZOeHRQYTl2QkxBaGNIaHZxUy1iTCt5ekRKUzUzc0t6RHM0S3JmNGdpZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5yN2p2Nitpb2IxNW1AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":77481,"nextInTopic":77483,"prevInTime":77481,"nextInTime":77483,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra s post mentioning eating disorders reminded me of some recent news items.

Here in Australia there was a news story recently noting the increase in eating disorders in young people. While the most affected group were aged 15-24 they were seeing an increase in males, under 12&#39;s, and highlighted the fact that even kids as young as six (although uncommon) were presenting with eating disorders. When going back to find the link I then found essentially the same news story written two years ago with the same researcher being interviewed (a local Doctor in charge of a regional eating disorder group) &amp; the story back then was the youngest was 8 years old. Sadly this sort of headline wasn&#39;t unique to Aus &amp; seems to be a trend in other countries as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve linked the article at the bottom in case it&#39;s of interest but here&#39;s a quote:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;There is a lot of comments coming from primary school children about dieting and not eating too much fat and not gaining weight.&quot;<br>\n- Dr Melissa Hart</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Primary school children here are aged 5-12.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was also another news story this week where Doctors highlighted how the strong anti obesity messages in the media have contributed. We hear that in our media here a lot particularly about childhood obesity, diabetes etc &amp; whilst these can have health implications too there is definitely a lot of fear out there about food as a result.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the same time those stories were running it was reported some schools had banned selling chocolate as part of school fundraisers.

We used boxed brownies because they could do all of it ( except hot oven stuff) with me watching. They used to divide up the steps. They loved their brownies, they remember this fondly from their childhood. When they got older they asked to make complex recipes from scratch, and still do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>They decided on their own &nbsp;to be vegetarian because they initially did not care much for meat, poultry or fish, and later ( research) for other ethical reasons. Every three years or so, they hanker for a bit of meat- like one meal- and I happily provide it. When they have had enough, they return to being veg. But my point is that * they* have been calling the shots with regard to food choices. There is no pressure either way. They never asked to go to the large franchise burger places, they always preferred the ones I make at home. That is our family, though, and had they wanted something else I would have worked at giving them the burger etc regardless of my own internal feelings about what feels good to *my*body.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My youngest daughter and husband love fresh, raw goat milk from the shepherd who passes by our home daily. They just do. It is also easier for them to digest. &nbsp;This is considered healthy etc but my older two and myself prefer pasteurized cow&#39;s milk....and so in our fridge you will find both goat/ cow dairy products as per their preferences. It is really quite easy to lovingly accommodate everyone when that is a priority.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also love what Karen said about comfort foods. Proof that emotions and food are all tied together. I feel so good hearing their happy memories of foods we have made or served over the years and seeing &nbsp;how much better they are at listening to their bodies ( than I am- I am terrible about remembering to eat). &nbsp;It feels good to do better.</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Cellulite","postDate":"1473577436","msgId":77477,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFQzdFNjYxLTg3RTQtNDU2Ny04RUZDLTIxQ0VBODM5MTlDNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2NDEzNDQyMS4yOTc0NjkzLjE0NzM1NTkxMTkxNzBAbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2NDEzNDQyMS4yOTc0NjkzLjE0NzM1NTkxMTkxNzAucmVmQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8MzY0MTM0NDIxLjI5NzQ2OTMuMTQ3MzU1OTExOTE3MEBtYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77476,"nextInTopic":77478,"prevInTime":77476,"nextInTime":77478,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lisa Celedo wrote: -=-This might be sort of tangential, but it s been on my mind a lot lately, about the way people will jump on a this is bad for you! train","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-304247203\">Lisa Celedo wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This might be sort of tangential, but it&#39;s been on my mind a lot lately, about the way people will jump on a &quot;this is bad for you!&quot; train and just ride it without another thought about where the train is actually going.

I got plenty that summer, and learned what I needed to learn about how and when it can benefit me, or not. &nbsp;Not in my head, not from other people, but from my own gut.<br><br>My kids have been eating in peace, without the presence of negativity or fear or convoluted beliefs in their home about which foods are &quot;good&quot; &quot;real&quot; food, and which are not, for most of their young lives. &nbsp;They eat what they like, they leave what they don&#39;t, and they often choose things other kids might not ever touch (my older son frequently chooses cauliflower or green beans or boiled eggs over any of the other sweet or &quot;processed&quot; options he has available to him) without having been told by me that one choice is &quot;healthier&quot; or better than another. &nbsp;<br><br>My older son has talked recently about some of his food choices, telling me things like, &quot;Mom, I need starburst. My brain is just really busy and it just really needs like, more good energy.&quot; &nbsp;(Sugar, &quot;highly processed&quot; simple sugars are the best fuel for the brain, the easiest to digest, the quickest and most efficiently utilized by the brain--far more efficient than fruit or protein or fats (though he often likes those other things too)-- he doesn&#39;t know that in words or in an idea, but that knowledge lives inside of him in whole way. &nbsp;<br><br>The other day he was trying to explain to me that he wanted to eat, but his stomach didn&#39;t want food, his brain didn&#39;t want his stomach to have food, because it was too busy for food, this confused him, and he was trying to understand it. &nbsp;His words brought to my mind that when the stomach is digesting, it diverts energy and blood flow from other parts of the body in order to do it. &nbsp;Maybe his brain was the thing that needed the resources in that moment. :) Sometimes I try to say a little about those things, but mostly he is still too young to like much of me talking. :) &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;ll interest him someday, or maybe it&#39;ll never need to be a thing that needs to interest him at all. &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;ll just be another bit of his own internal wisdom that doesn&#39;t ever need to be pulled out and examined and looked at in a detached way.<br><br>It&#39;s been really, *really* cool to hear my introspective little boy start putting some of what he notices about himself into words. &nbsp;I&#39;m so grateful for the information and resources radical unschoolers like Sandra have made available, and discussed openly, tirelessly, at length, so that I have been able to protect so much of my children&#39;s natural integrity.<br><br>My son made a box cake last week, he likes boxed cakes because he isn&#39;t currently interested in the time and all the different steps of adding lots of ingredients for a from-scratch cake. &nbsp;Box cake is simple and quick and just exactly what he has time and interest and attention for. &nbsp;It&#39;s also really cheap, which is good for me, since he hardly ever eats much of the cakes we make, from-scratch or not! He enjoys the making more than the eating. :)<br>&nbsp;<br>He ate half of one piece of that cake and then the whole thing sat there untouched for the rest of the week. &nbsp;My husband and I enjoy cake and cookies and sweets, but neither of us ended up eating any of it, either (though I ate almost two dozen coconut chocolate pecan cookies I made over that same week! No one else liked them, but for me--YUUUMMMM). Boxed cake isn&#39;t often really very good, if you&#39;re used to eating what really tastes good to you. &nbsp;But it can also be just the right thing sometimes! &nbsp;I remember feeling like it was a rare delicacy when I was a child! &nbsp;I remember when it was the best thing I&#39;d ever tasted, fresh from the oven.&nbsp;<br><br>`Lisa Celedon &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"","from":"semajrak@...","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Cellulite","postDate":"1473542053","msgId":77475,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5yMXQzNStudG44ZW9AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3NkIwMzVBLTE3QzMtNDdBRi04QjkzLTU5QTA3QjAxQjU0Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDMyNTU0NjY5LjE0NzI1MzgwMzY5MjAuSmF2YU1haWwud2FtQG1zd2FtdWktdmFsbGV5LmF0bC5zYS5lYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8VkkxUFIwNzAxTUIxOTAyQTk5NjU5NDdGMjEwREVGNEY1REVCN0UwMEBWSTFQUjA3MDFNQjE5MDIuZXVycHJkMDcucHJvZC5vdXRsb29rLmNvbT4gPGFmYzJjYWVhLTQ2M2EtNDNkNi1iYjlhLTA2OGU2ZjI3NTI0YUB0eXBlYXBwLmNvbT4gPDUzQzFBOTNFLUE0MDEtNDgwNy1CMDNCLUMxREMyRjBCMTMxREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG5xdXY5aytjdDk3MGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Mjc2QjAzNUEtMTdDMy00N0FGLThCOTMtNTlBMDdCMDFCNTRDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77472,"nextInTopic":77476,"prevInTime":77474,"nextInTime":77476,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Do you think that if someone lets a child eat hamburgers that it’s ALL he will ever eat?*** This made me smile because it brought to mind something that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-882922886\"><span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;line-height:normal;font-size:12.8px;\">***Do you think that if someone lets a child eat hamburgers that it’s ALL he will ever eat?***</span><br style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">This made me smile because it brought to mind something that happens here. &nbsp;I love McDonald&#39;s hamburgers...cheeseburgers actually--the little ones that come in happy meals. &nbsp;I love them with an order of small fries. &nbsp;Less than a dozen times a year I stop and get a cheeseburger and small fry at a McDonald&#39;s drive-through. &nbsp;I like the salty taste. &nbsp;More important to me, however, eating it reminds me of being with my dad as a kid. &nbsp;That feels good. &nbsp;I could go more often. &nbsp;There&#39;s no reason I don&#39;t, other than I go when I feel like it, and I don&#39;t feel like it more often than I go. &nbsp;;-)</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Ethan doesn&#39;t prefer McDonald&#39;s food. &nbsp;He liked it when he was very young, but then grew to not prefer it. &nbsp;Most often he&#39;s in the car with me when I get my hankerings. &nbsp;I ask him if he&#39;d like anything from McDonald&#39;s. &nbsp;He&#39;ll usually say &quot;No thanks, but you go ahead. &nbsp;Can we stop at...&quot; wherever he has a taste for at the time. &nbsp;I say &quot;Sure!&quot; and, once we have our food, we eat each our own food in peace. &nbsp;That&#39;s the part that made me smile--the recalling of us eating each our own food in peace. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad we have that.</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">I know a number of people that are strictly against McDonald&#39;s for reasons that range from politics to nutrition.

He was a wiry child, very straight up and down with London thin limbs. Always liked food and ate quite well and liked processed food alongside fresh. When he was around ten he started to get a layer of fat, especially\n round his middle, but I noticed a pattern that it happened then he grew then he got fatter, then he grew upwards again. He didn&#39;t have cellulite that I noticed but his cousin did the same and I remember he was larger round the chest area. I&#39;m not sure I would\n have called it cellulite but fat does sometimes look a bit dimpled on children in my experience, especially for example on their belly when they sit down, I have definitely seen that before. He went through the forever eating stage, It did concern me a bit\n but I used to leave big jars of dried fruit and nuts on the side so it was easy for him to help himself to those rather than go in the cupboard for other things. He also used to eat loads of bread and cereal but was fairly active as he grew so I&#39;m guessing\n he needed the carbs for growth as well as activity. Anyway my point was going to be to say that despite needing 36&quot; waist trousers at 14 once he reached his Adult height of 6&#39;4&quot; at about 16 he was back to the wiry frame with long thin limbs of his childhood.\n He finds it hard to put weight on now despite weight training. His cousin wasn&#39;t as wiry as him as a child and isn&#39;t as wiry as an adult but is definitely a normal size with no fat on his chest. It seems from these two that maybe the body needs to sometimes\n lay down some fat to prepare for what is to come!</div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature\"><br>\n</div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature\">Kind regards</div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature\"><br>\n</div>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157196431AppleMailSignature\">Beverley<br>\n<br>\nSent from my iPad</div>\n<div><br>\nOn 30 Aug 2016, at 07:49, Robin Flinchum <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rkflinchum@...\">\nrkflinchum@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\">\n<div><span style=\"display:none;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1157196431ygrp-text\">\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n \n</span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291756953,"authorName":"Robin Flinchum","from":"Robin Flinchum &lt;rkflinchum@...&gt;","profile":"rkflinchum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Cellulite","postDate":"1472538036","msgId":77457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyNTU0NjY5LjE0NzI1MzgwMzY5MjAuSmF2YU1haWwud2FtQG1zd2FtdWktdmFsbGV5LmF0bC5zYS5lYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77458,"prevInTime":77456,"nextInTime":77458,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All, in the past year my ten year old son, who has always been thin and wiry, has begun to bulk up.

I figured this is normal at this stage of development, but now I notice that he has some cellulite on his chest. I haven&#39;t mentioned it to him and he hasn&#39;t noticed it himself, but I am becoming concerned because I understand cellulite is not reversible and I don&#39;t want him to be self conscious about it. But on the other hand, if I can help him avoid developing any more of it, I think I should do so. The thing is, he really loves processed foods like chips and Lunchables and once a month I take him to McDonald&#39;s because he loves it so much. I don&#39;t monitor his food and have never worried about it before but now I feel like I should do something, but I don&#39;t know how to go about it. I don&#39;t want to make an issue of it so that he feels self conscious and unattractive, but I want to help him avoid future frustration with his appearance as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be grateful for any advice, both in terms of how to approach the subject with my son and also, if he wants to make a change, how to help someone who loves lots of fat and sugar to transition to a lighter way of eating--or will that make a difference? He is not even chubby, just bulking compared to the wiry, thin way he used to be. I was really surprised by the cellulite, have never seen that on a kid before. He does also get lots of healthy food, just really prefers the processed versions of things. I think the bulking will even out as he grows, although in the past year he&#39;s become much more sedentary while he is gaming and watching Youtube videos. He takes breaks and jumps on the trampoline a lot, which helps. It&#39;s the cellulite that concerns me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice,  Robin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77508,"nextTopicId":77517}}
