I ended up stopping reading it and finding myself<br/>\nmore interested in this list at some point, but that&#39;s just me.<br/>\nAlwayUnschooled is an excellent list and I am really glad that it was<br/>\ncreated :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Sep 7, 2008 at 10:34 AM, Robyn Coburn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;The reason the AlwaysUnschooled list was created is that I objected<br/>\n&gt; to people with babies saying they were unschoolers.
