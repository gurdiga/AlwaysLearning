I could not imagine putting my daughters on Ritilan. My <br/>\n  nephew and a couple of my cousins had been on it, and they were even <br/>\n  more violent while taking it. I do not believe in using meds for <br/>\n  AD/HD/ODD with young children. And, I&#39;m not sure on this, but I don&#39;t <br/>\n  think that it is a good idea to have such a small child on all of <br/>\n  those meds all at once. I would think that the long term side affects <br/>\n  would be horrible.  I believe that doctors are way too quick to <br/>\n  diagnose AD/HD/ODD. <br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as depression goes, I have another nephew with it, and he does <br/>\n  just fine with no meds. His parents are lucky that his school works <br/>\n  with them, and they are always there for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you have a good handle on things to bring with you concerning <br/>\n  homeschooling, but I&#39;m not sure if I would do anything spiteful <br/>\n  against the father for disagreeing. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 <br/>\n  states, so I think that he would have to show proof that you are NOT <br/>\n  educating your son. It sounds to me like he doesn&#39;t have a chance. <br/>\n  Maybe if you offered him some, but not complete, say in what your son <br/>\n  learns. And let the judge know that you would like to have the <br/>\n  fathers input.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You could even call the father some time and say something <br/>\n  like, &quot;Hey, I just wanted to get your input on (Son&#39;s name) school <br/>\n  subjects. He is doing very well and is getting good grades, and I was <br/>\n  wondering how you felt about...&quot;  Maybe he would like to feel more <br/>\n  involved. Make sure he knows about any programs that are available in <br/>\n  your area. Some examples are: Book clubs at the library, day sports <br/>\n  camps in the summer, church and Sunday school, craft classes, boy <br/>\n  scouts, YM/WCA programs, homeschooling 4-H programs, play groups. <br/>\n  That way he will know that you want your child to have some <br/>\n  experiences outside of the home. It might not be a bad idea to <br/>\n  mention these things to the judge, as well. If he is already <br/>\n  attending any of these, get letters from these sources as well. If <br/>\n  you go to church, a letter from the reverend/father, etc. would also <br/>\n  count.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As long as you are doing what you truly believe is the best thing for <br/>\n  your son, you should be okay.  Who knows, if your husband is totally <br/>\n  against homeschooling and slips and says the wrong thing, you may <br/>\n  find that the judge will find it offensive because his daughter <br/>\n  homeschool her children. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope i didn&#39;t offend anyone.

Sounds like you have done everything needed for <br/>\nyour court presentation.  You might want to also collect information <br/>\non the long-term potentially harmful effects of all those drugs your <br/>\nson was on.  Especially since no one has adequately tested the <br/>\nsynergistic effects of so many meds on children&#39;s delicate brains and <br/>\nother vital systems (kidneys, liver, pancreas, etc.).  If his dad <br/>\ncan&#39;t present proof that these are totally safe, then you can sue him <br/>\nfor the potential lifetime effects of forcing your son to be on all <br/>\nthose meds.
