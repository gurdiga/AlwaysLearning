Been lurking thus far...not much time to post<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, speaking of TV, there is good stuff on. Our two favorites are the Wild Thornberries (Nick) and Crashbox (HBO Family). Currently, though, Crashbox is our families obsession - I highly recommend it to all. They say it&#39;s for kids 7 and up but my alsmot 5 yo loves it and can solve some of the puzzles/games. Really cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is sad that school is so glorified on most kid shows. There&#39;s even an HBO Family show called &quot;Kindergarten&quot;. It&#39;s a reality show that documents what kindergarten is like. My daughter liked it for a bit, we talked about what she saw.I pointed out that the kids could not follow their own interests, they could not speak when they wanted to, they couldn&#39;t have mom present....etc... My daughter is no longer interested. Brainwashing.....all brainwashing! I also told her that the show was not a realistic Kindergarten. The class on TV had like 10 kids to one teacher in a perfect classroom. In our PS&#39;s it more like 30 to one and the kids learn absolutely nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Nanci Kuykendall <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 02, 2002 12:40 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Great Kid Shows (was Speaking of Brainwashing)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;There are some great exceptions.
