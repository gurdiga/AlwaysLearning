It&#39;s  a proprietary part so very <br/>\nexpensive to replace. I found a newer old computer, and paid only $20 at the <br/>\nsurplus place for the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if I can come up with $200 to have him get that one up and running <br/>\nthen I should be back online next week sometime. I&#39;m really missing everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nHad my oral surgery on Thursday, still puffy and bruised but feeling a lot <br/>\nbetter today.<br/>\n<br/>\nCelebrated my Birthday yesterday and all is well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, I&#39;ll be back soon. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14495,"nextTopicId":14507}}
