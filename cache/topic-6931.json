But dogs having scent and hearing <br/>\nas their strong senses, and NOT being good visually, dogs will bark, and <br/>\npeople will get up and grab a tool or weapon and look, and so the two species <br/>\nhave been found in relationship to one another since cave-days.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther animals can serve that purpose too--alerting people if there are <br/>\nstrange people or animals outside the house.

I didn&#39;t manage to lose *most* <br/>\nof that fear until I had grown up and moved to a place where there are no <br/>\npoisonous snakes.  Even then, I had to de-sensitize myself gradually, by <br/>\nmaking myself look at pictures and then touch the pictures.  Then I could <br/>\ntouch a snake at the science museum.  Then one day, I was with a group of <br/>\nadults and kids who had spotted an injured snake on the lawn.  We figured <br/>\nit had been injured by a lawn mower.
