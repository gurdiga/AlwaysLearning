Critics call it  <br/>\nirresponsible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the intro statement from the article &quot;Endless summer&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/10/03/unschool/index.html\">http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/10/03/unschool/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe article&#39;s not new, it&#39;s from October 2005, but a couple of things  <br/>\nstirred it this week and I keep thinking about that intro line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been interviewed lots of times, and no matter how clearly the  <br/>\ninterviewer or researcher thinks she understands it or no matter how  <br/>\nconvincingly they summarize their understanding for me, it seems  <br/>\nthere&#39;s always a grating flaw that makes unschooling look CRAZY once  <br/>\nthey write it down, or makes it seem mean or misguided or neglectful  <br/>\nor that the parents aren&#39;t doing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, since even people who actually try to  <br/>\nput it into practice in real homes with real kids can have a heck of  <br/>\na time balancing out what they&#39;re trying to do and what&#39;s going to  <br/>\nmake it worse or better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut control...  I think the idea of control is a hard one to get.   <br/>\nWho&#39;s in control?  If an interviewee or the subject of a study says  <br/>\n&quot;no one is in control&quot; that&#39;s a heck of a sound bite, and conjures  <br/>\nvisions of crazed debauchery.   And if it&#39;s only rephrased to the  <br/>\npoint that the interviewers or researchers get the idea that we&#39;re  <br/>\ntalking about &quot;self control&quot; it&#39;s still dealing in &quot;control.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we could ignore the parenting and potential wildness ideas, I  <br/>\nwant to talk about &quot;kids control what and when they learn.&quot;  In  <br/>\nanother post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26424,"nextTopicId":26429}}
