(Oh.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1530890991\">Down below here are quotes from an article about benefits of tea.  What <br/>\namuses me is the whole pseudo-science of what they mean to DO with this knowledge.  <br/>\n(Oh.   One quote I didn&#39;t bring was about making capsules with the active <br/>\ningredients in tea.)   Why not &quot;drink tea&quot;?  NO no no, they wouldn&#39;t know how <br/>\nmany milligrams you ingested, and they couldn&#39;t reformulate all all the <br/>\ntoothstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra (quotes from here on)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the &quot;bad breath&quot; study, researchers combined black tea extracts with three <br/>\nspecies of bacteria (all linked with bad breath) in petri dishes for 48 <br/>\nhours. They compared the results with bacteria that sat alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all cases, tea polyphenols inhibited the growth of bacteria by 30% and <br/>\nreduced the production of compounds that cause bad breath. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe study suggests that rinsing with black tea keeps plaque from forming and <br/>\ndestroys acids that cause tooth decay. <br/>\n----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the same study suggests that green tea boosts the effectiveness of <br/>\ntoothpaste and mouthwash in fighting viruses. Toothpaste and mouthwash had very <br/>\nlittle virus-fighting effect when mixed with bacteria; however, when green <br/>\ntea extract was added, 99% to 100% of the bacteria disappeared. What&#39;s <br/>\nresponsible for the health benefits of tea? Teas contain polyphenols, which are <br/>\nantioxidants that protect human cells from damage. Flavonids are a group of <br/>\npolyphenols that occur naturally in tea. It is suspected that high levels of these <br/>\npolyphenols in the body can fight viruses as well as cancer, including pancreas, <br/>\ncolon, bladder, prostate, and breast cancer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth studies detailing health benefits of tea were presented at the annual <br/>\nAmerican Society for Microbiology General Meeting held in Washington, D.C., this <br/>\nweek.   <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aolsvc.health.webmd.aol.com/content/article/65/72589.htm?DEST=WebMD&contentSRC=aolmain&quot;\">http://aolsvc.health.webmd.aol.com/content/article/65/72589.htm?DEST=WebMD&contentSRC=aolmain&quot;</a>&gt;WebMD with AOL Health - Tea Fights Bad Breath, Mouth Bacteria&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14761,"nextTopicId":14896}}
