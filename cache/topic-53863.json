That way people can get unfrozen. Still have to have one <br/>\nperson as &quot;It&quot; but when someone is tagged, they have to freeze in place. <br/>\nThe other players can untag them -- but they risk getting tagged while <br/>\nthey do it. The simplest way is that they can unfreeze someone by <br/>\ntagging them. But we&#39;ve also played where they have to crawl between <br/>\ntheir legs to untag them. Another version is that, if you get tagged, <br/>\nyou can unfreeze yourself by calling out a color (players can&#39;t repeat <br/>\ncolors).<br/>\n<br/>\nMonster tag. When you get tagged, you link arms  or hold hands and work <br/>\ntogether to tag the next person. The monster grows until everyone is <br/>\npart of the monster. Only the players on the end of the monster can <br/>\nactually tag - since only they have a free hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nStatues? That was a super popular alternative to tag for my kids and <br/>\ntheir friends. Here&#39;s how to play Statues.<br/>\n<br/>\n   1. A person starts out as the &quot;Curator<br/>\n      &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator</a>&gt;&quot; and stands at the end of a<br/>\n      field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance<br/>\n      depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for<br/>\n      a &quot;Statue&quot; to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and<br/>\n      resetting the game.<br/>\n   2. The Curator turns their back to the field, and the &quot;Statues&quot;<br/>\n      attempt to race across and tag the Curator.<br/>\n   3. Whenever the Curator turns around, the Statues must freeze in<br/>\n      position and hold that for as long as the Curator looks at them.<br/>\n      The Curator can even walk around the Statues, examining them.<br/>\n      However, the Curator needs to be careful - whenever their back is<br/>\n      turned, Statues are free to move.<br/>\n   4. If a Statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting<br/>\n      line to begin again (or thrown out of that round, whichever way is<br/>\n      preferred.) Usually, the honesty of the Curator isn&#39;t an issue -<br/>\n      it&#39;s more fun to be a Statue anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think my kids way of playing it also involved a guessing game <br/>\naspect - if the curator guessed what the statue was a statue of, that <br/>\nstatue could become the curator or go back to start (not sure which it was).<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] any ideas for cooperative playground structure games?","postDate":"1273155054","msgId":53879,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBFREQ2ODkzLUU2MkItNDJBMy1CNzQzLUQ5QkY3RjM2OTczQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhydG9icithaG4zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhydG9icithaG4zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53863,"nextInTopic":53899,"prevInTime":53878,"nextInTime":53880,"topicId":53863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My question, does anyone have any ideas for a loose game that involves the kids using the playground structure?

However, at the playground, when she is trying to get a game together, she pretty much always falls back on Tag.  This leads to a lot of playground angst, and saying everything that she is on is base. Luckily, there was a slightly older boy at the park today who didn&#39;t mind being &quot;It&quot;, LOL.    I recently had a birthday party for her, and did a lot of research on cooperative games, and found some good ones (just to share a little): <br/>\n<br/>\nWho has the key?<br/>\nEveryone gets in a circle, and you unwind some string, making sure that it goes all the way around, put a key on the string, and then tie a knot.  Someone sits in the middle, closes their eyes, and counts to twenty. While they&#39;re counting, you pass the key around the circle, and  when they open their eyes, they have to guess who has the key. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question, does anyone have any ideas for a loose game that involves the kids using the playground structure?  I&#39;ve noticed that they all want to be on the structure, and play a game using all the different climbing aspects of structure.
