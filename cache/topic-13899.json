Back then, you owned it. Your major newspapers, <br/>\n  television and radio stations were owned and operated by Kentuckians. <br/>\n  Today home ownership is pretty much confined to small-town weeklies, KET <br/>\n  and the public radio stations. Your major daily newspapers are now <br/>\n  provincial outposts for absentee corporate owners who expect profit <br/>\n  margins of 20 to 30 percent. The managers of your TV stations report to <br/>\n  bosses far away who care less about the stations&#39; community service and <br/>\n  journalistic expos&eacute;s than they care about how those stations are <br/>\n  contributing to the share price of corporate stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/p&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;p&gt;As exhibit A, I give you the Dixie Chicks, one of the hottest musical <br/>\n  acts in the country -- or at least they were until one of the Chicks, in <br/>\n  a bit of anti-war fervor, said they were ashamed that the President is <br/>\n  from Texas. The backlash against the Chicks for making that remark is <br/>\n  fine if it comes from ex-fans who say they won&#39;t buy any more records by <br/>\n  the Dixie Chicks. The marketplace is a respectable forum for freedom of <br/>\n  expression. The Chicks have a right to their opinions. Music fans have a <br/>\n  right to tell the chicks to go to hell and to boycott their concerts and <br/>\n  refuse to buy their records. Free speech is never really free -- it <br/>\n  always costs something. But here&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with this picture. The <br/>\n  backlash against the Chicks is spearheaded not by fans, but by Clear <br/>\n  Channel Radio, owner of 1,250 radio stations. Clear Channel is based in <br/>\n  Texas. Clear Channel loves George W. Bush. Clear Channel would like the <br/>\n  administration of George W. Bush to remove all remaining restrictions on <br/>\n  the ownership of media properties. That is exactly what the Bush <br/>\n  administration is considering. The &quot;Federal Communi-cations Commission&quot;, <br/>\n  chaired by Mike Powell, the son of Secretary of State Colin Powell, is <br/>\n  reviewing the last remaining rules restricting media ownership. Before <br/>\n  he became FCC chairman, Mike Powell was a communications lawyer, making <br/>\n  fabulous sums of money lobbying on behalf of the broadcast industry -- <br/>\n  the industry he&#39;s now supposed to be regulating. When he is finished <br/>\n  regulating the broadcasting industry, Mike Powell will return to -- the <br/>\n  broadcasting industry. Now how tenacious is Mike Powell going to be in <br/>\n  regulating the broadcasting industry while he is on this temporary <br/>\n  hiatus from the broadcasting industry? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But back to Clear <br/>\n  Channel, which daily tells Bush and Powell that it loves them. Is Clear <br/>\n  Channel&#39;s move on those Dixie Chicks an expression of patriotism or a <br/>\n  business decision? Should Clear Channel have the right to ban the Chicks <br/>\n  from its 1,250 stations? I think what individuals do is fine -- burn the <br/>\n  CDs if you want. What industry does is another matter. Clear Channel can <br/>\n  say the Dixie Chicks are tools of Saddam if it wants to, but it should <br/>\n  not be allowed to kill the livelihood of any recording artist based on <br/>\n  politics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;The influential television news <br/>\n  consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates recently put it in even <br/>\n  starker terms: Covering war protests may be harmful to a station&#39;s <br/>\n  bottom line. In a survey released . . . on the eve of war, the firm <br/>\n  found that war protests were the topic that tested lowest among 6,400 <br/>\n  viewers across the nation. Magid says only 14 percent of respondents <br/>\n  said TV news wasn&#39;t paying enough attention to anti-war demonstrations <br/>\n  and peace activities; just 13 percent thought that in the event of war, <br/>\n  the news should pay more attention to dissent.&#39;&#39; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here again, the <br/>\n  lack of diversity among broadcast owners is a factor in what information <br/>\n  gets to the American public. Andrew Jay Schwartzman of the Media Access <br/>\n  Project is quoted by the Post as saying, &#39;&#39;with increasing concentration <br/>\n  of ownership, if one or two big companies are using the same <br/>\n  corporate-wide policy, or relying on the same consultants, there aren&#39;t <br/>\n  effective competitive forces&#39;&#39; to ensure alternative opinions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[ <br/>\n  ... ]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But last month&#39;s news conference was remarkable for more <br/>\n  than the fact that it happened at all. Reporters were ushered into the <br/>\n  East Room in pairs -- summoned two-by-two, like the animals boarding <br/>\n  Noah&#39;s Ark. Once the news conference got underway, the President did not <br/>\n  recognize reporters who raised their hands. Instead, he called their <br/>\n  names from a list prepared by news secretary Ari Fleischer, the man who <br/>\n  told reporters after Sept. 11 that they should watch what they say. When <br/>\n  CNN&#39;s John King attempted to ask a question, the President told him to <br/>\n  wait because, the President said, &#39;&#39;This is scripted.&#39;&#39; Then he called <br/>\n  the next name on his list: John King. Then he taunted King for daring to <br/>\n  ask a multi-part question. Among the names not called -- and perhaps not <br/>\n  on Ari&#39;s Fleischer&#39;s list of approved questioners -- were the reporters <br/>\n  from Time, The Washington Post, USA Today, Newsweek and Kentucky&#39;s own <br/>\n  Helen Thomas, who for decades has had the distinction of asking the <br/>\n  first question and then closing the news conference by saying, &#39;&#39;Thank <br/>\n  you, Mr. President,&#39;&#39; which became the title of her autobiography. But <br/>\n  Helen is no longer a reporter. She&#39;s now a columnist, paid to give <br/>\n  opinions, and one of her recent opinions is that George W. Bush &#39;&#39;is the <br/>\n  worst President ever.&#39;&#39; Clearly, she did not watch what she said. <br/>\n  Another White House tradition, the follow-up question, also appears to <br/>\n  be history. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now why are the tough questions not <br/>\n  being asked? Do journalists wearing their flag lapel pins on TV not want <br/>\n  to appear unpatriotic in time of war? The answer is yes. Av Westin said <br/>\n  it very well last month. Av Westin goes back to the glory days of <br/>\n  network television news. He was a producer at CBS for 20 years and a <br/>\n  producer at ABC for 21 more years. He said, &#39;&#39;Since 9/11, the press has <br/>\n  been watching the opinion polls almost as much as the administration, <br/>\n  which explains why it has taken quite a while to assume the kind of <br/>\n  normal adversarial relationship, much less the kind that was rampant <br/>\n  during the Clinton years and the Nixon years.&#39;&#39; He added, &#39;&#39;There is a <br/>\n  considerable amount of self-censorship going on in terms of pushing <br/>\n  government officials on certain topics. But I&#39;ve always believed our job <br/>\n  was to ask questions that need to be asked, regardless of official <br/>\n  reaction or public opinion.&#39;&#39; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s absolutely right. Being <br/>\n  popular might be good for business at a time when newspapers are losing <br/>\n  readers and TV networks are losing viewers. And the owners of today&#39;s <br/>\n  media, who are business tycoons, not journalists, would like us to be <br/>\n  good representatives of the corporate brands. But that is not our job. <br/>\n  We are supposed to be surrogates for the public -- the eyes and ears of <br/>\n  citizens who don&#39;t have the access we have. We are to hold public <br/>\n  officials to account, and if that makes them angry at us -- well, that <br/>\n  just goes with our job, and we have to take it. If pointed questions <br/>\n  make public officials squirm -- well, that just goes with their job, and <br/>\n  they&#39;re supposed to take it. That&#39;s the price that comes with the <br/>\n  privilege of serving the people. &lt;/p&gt; <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/cjextra/editorials/ed0420_edwards.html\">http://www.courier-journal.com/cjextra/editorials/ed0420_edwards.html</a> <br/>\n  The press and freedom: some disturbing trends <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mediaaccess.org/\">http://www.mediaaccess.org/</a>  Media Access Project    Example Web Page.<br/>\n<br/>\n  From:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Copyright 1997-2003 Paul Hardwick  2.0b1  Thu, 24 Apr 2003 04:00:00 GMT <br/>\n    Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:43:10 GMT <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11\">http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11</a>  Privacy Digest keeps <br/>\n  track of news and events that can impact your privacy in either a direct <br/>\n  or indirect manner.
