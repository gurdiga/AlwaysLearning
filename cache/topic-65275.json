I used to have to be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1779275998\">IN my experience with my son who loves to play video games is that :<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does love to play fight and does with his friends and his sister. I used to have to be right there to help keep it safe but now he is able to keep it safe. I also noticed that his friend that is not allowed to play and does not have video games or TV is much more agressive and wants to play fight a lot. The difference is that MD pretends and this kid really goes for hurting ( behind the adults backs) so I have to be there and facilitate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen MD  stops playing and is restless it means that he needs connection and /or needs to do physical things because of pent up energy.<br/>\nWhen he was younger we would run around the house, jump in bed ( I so want a trampoline!)  and do things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds in the post the mom gives the child who says he is bored ideas. With my kids I join them. I don&#39;t just give ideas. I go do stuff with them. Many times all they need is the connection and doing things with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen kids come out from playing video games and go outside play just because I did let them know I was going and they joined me a while later and happily played with me.<br/>\nTelling them what to do is not the same as doing with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent is under the impression that he/she is just going to sit there and give ideas and the kids are going to be happy with that I think that their lives are not going to be as fun and as interesting as when they have parents that joined them in exploring and playing.<br/>\n <br/>\nI notice that parents who have or had kids in school are very detached , most of them, from their kids playing and exploring around. They expect their child to entertain themselves all the time. I see that my kids want me to be part of their lives fully. Not all the time or on everything, but present and participating. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a gamer, I do play some games and I like it but I am terrible at more complicated controllers like the X-box ones. But I know , from talking and reading, about all my son&#39;s games. He loves to come and talk to me about them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just upgraded his computer memory  myself and he is so happy. I am getting really good at computer stuff just because I am always learning with him how to make his play better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe more present, more involved, participate.  If kids are full of energy come up with a fun physical game and be part of it. There will be laughter and smiles and happy kids !<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, January 27, 2012 8:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: video games and energy play fighting<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-It took me a while to find a balance between &#39;unlimited&#39; and &#39;active presence&#39;, but I can truly say that for some time now my kids (aged 4 and 6) have been very easily able to leave the tv or iPad to go and play an imaginative game with their soft toys, or paint a picture, or create a house for our guinea pigs, or meet friends at the park, or another of the many things they get up to in a day.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some people go from limits to &quot;no limits&quot; in a large swing to the extreme.

I hope I can be clear about this, as I am not advocating limits at all. My own kids watch/play all the tv/games they want, but I try to make sure I am with them pretty much the whole time.
