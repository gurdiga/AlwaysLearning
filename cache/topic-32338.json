To <br/>\nget some perspective about it I&#39;d say to watch your son with a variety of playmates and <br/>\nlook realistically at what you see.  Does your son need more help?  It can be really <br/>\ntempting to let kids go off to play so we have mom-talking time, but different kids are <br/>\nready at different times for more independence.  And some relationships require more <br/>\nattention than others do.  The chemistry factor can be huge between playmates and can <br/>\nbring out entirely different behaviors--whether your child behaves like a leader or a <br/>\nfollower can sometimes change depending on the playmate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you need to let this go for now, but time passing can make a difference, and <br/>\nat eight, you son may not miss his friends as much as you do, especially if you focus on <br/>\nother playmates.  And to know that there are real consequences to not working things out <br/>\nequitably (if that is in fact what was happening) is not such a bad thing to learn about. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be that things will shift around, because they frequently do with kids (not always <br/>\nwith adults, however), and the mom might be willing to try again in the future.  Her own <br/>\nkids will have that time to develop other relationships, and perhaps find a place of <br/>\nspeaking up for themselves more, if that&#39;s what is needed on their part.  Just seeing your <br/>\nkid/s spending a lot of time in the &quot;follower&quot; role can look a little scary to a parent, <br/>\njustified or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kim H&quot; &lt;kimlewismark@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re going through a difficult time in a friendship at the moment between <br/>\n&gt; my 8 year old ds and his two friends who are twin boys, 7 and a half yrs <br/>\n&gt; old.

The boys&#39; mum and I, also <br/>\n&gt; friends, have discussed this many times over the past year in particular. <br/>\n&gt; The boys have been telling their mum about situations, when playing with my <br/>\n&gt; ds that they&#39;ve felt uncomfortable with (rough play, negative words said to <br/>\n&gt; them etc) and she&#39;s now, after an incident at our unschoolers group a couple <br/>\n&gt; of weeks or so ago, severed the friendship and told the boys they can&#39;t see <br/>\n&gt; my ds anymore. All three boys are unhappy about this decision. I tried to <br/>\n&gt; suggest we get together and see if we could problem solve, with the boys, <br/>\n&gt; the situation and see if we could come up some better ways of dealing with <br/>\n&gt; things - both for them and for us. I know my ds must be not coping too well <br/>\n&gt; in their friendship at times for him to behaving in some of the ways it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; been said he&#39;s behaving and I see that they need our help to move through <br/>\n&gt; this phase in the friendship.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If her boys had wanted this decision to be made then I wouldn&#39;t have an <br/>\n&gt; issue with the friendship ceasing but because all 3 boys don&#39;t want this I <br/>\n&gt; feel extremely sad that we, as the parents, can hold this much power in <br/>\n&gt; their lives. Labels of &#39;bully&#39; and &#39;dark&#39; have been given to my ds by this <br/>\n&gt; mum, and I really understand her fears for her boys. But, knowing my ds, I <br/>\n&gt; know that something, at the times these negative behaviours are coming out, <br/>\n&gt; must be causing him to respond in this way and he needs my help and guidance <br/>\n&gt; to move through it and find acceptable ways for dealing with situations. He <br/>\n&gt; has been, in the past, a fairly volatile person but since turning 8, he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; really calmed down alot and in much more control of his anger and emotions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find, with my ds, that lots of discussion about how others feel and how he <br/>\n&gt; was feeling really helps him move through situations and come out better <br/>\n&gt; able to deal with things, especially as time&#39;s going on and he&#39;s becoming <br/>\n&gt; more emotionally mature.

She has twins -  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need your son as much as he needs them and he appears, to  <br/>\nher at least, to be the problem. She probably feels like she&#39;s already  <br/>\ngiven it enough of a try and doesn&#39;t want to deal with it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, then all you can do is learn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found, personally, that it pays, in the long run, to try to  <br/>\nconvince someone to stay friends, once they&#39;ve decided to break it  <br/>\noff, it is really just a matter of time, because at that point any  <br/>\nlittle (normal) thing can push them over the edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt CAN be hard for one kid to be friends with twins, by the way,  <br/>\nbecause the twins often know each other so well and it can feel to the  <br/>\nthird kid like the twins are always backing each other up and sort of  <br/>\nganging up. My daughter was close friends with twins, and I know it  <br/>\noften felt to her like they spoke a sort of private language that she  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t entirely understand - she&#39;d get frustrated with them and get  <br/>\ndemanding or pushy or, often, say she wouldn&#39;t play unless they did  <br/>\nsomething her way. In HER mind, I think it was reaction to feeling  <br/>\nalways outnumbered by the two of them, but to them, she seemed  <br/>\nunreasonable. This was when they were about 8 to 10 years old, I&#39;d  <br/>\nsay. The mother of the twins saw it differently - she thought my  <br/>\ndaughter was jealous of the closeness of the twins. I really didn&#39;t  <br/>\nsee that, (my daughter has two sisters whom she was and is very close  <br/>\nto, no real reason for jealousy of that sisterly closeness) but, you  <br/>\nknow, reality was maybe a bit of both.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do convince the other parent to reconsider, maybe do it under  <br/>\nmuch more controlled circumstances - you spend time together such that  <br/>\nyou parents are right there with the kids all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider it good feedback - learn from it even if it doesn&#39;t work out.  <br/>\nHelp your son learn from it. Help him move on, too, and be forward  <br/>\nlooking, not living with resentment. LOTS of friendships of the early  <br/>\nyears will go by the wayside, don&#39;t YOU act like he should be more  <br/>\ndevastated than he is.
