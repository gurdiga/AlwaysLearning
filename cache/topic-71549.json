I read an interesting interview (in &quot;O&quot; magazine) with Brene Brown,<br/>\nwho studies shame (and vulnerability, guilt, and empathy), and I looked at<br/>\nsome other interviews with her on YouTube. Among other things, Brene Brown<br/>\npoints out that guilt is &quot;I did a bad thing,&quot; whereas shame is &quot;I am bad,&quot;<br/>\nand that guilt leads to better behavior, while shame makes us act worse<br/>\n(and can start a downward spiral, like Sandra&#39;s stepbrother&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nBrene Brown (and others) have pointed out that there are steps anyone can<br/>\ntake to heal shame. First, recognize the way it feels in your body. Then,<br/>\nput the shaming incident into perspective (i.e., &quot;hey, do I really deserve<br/>\nthis shame? why is this person really trying to shame me?&quot;). Lastly, speak<br/>\nyour shame. That last step reestablishes your social connection. Shame is<br/>\nan isolating emotion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Joy and hope instead of shame","postDate":"1370330958","msgId":71549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM1NEMyNEQ5LTNEMTMtNEUyMy04ODM0LTJEQTI5QjM0NUM1Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71550,"prevInTime":71548,"nextInTime":71550,"topicId":71549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s Tuesday morning and I m in Lisbon at Marta Pires s house.

So is Joyce Fetteroll.  This last weekend there was a symposium, and I&#39;m still tired. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne story I told was when I jokingly said to Holly, when she was a teen (I don&#39;t remember how old, but mid-teens?) &quot;You should be ashamed.&quot;  In context it wasn&#39;t shaming, it was humor.  But she looked at me seriously and said &quot;what does that mean?&quot;  She really didn&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe paragraph below just showed up in my e-mail (as part of something much longer).  It was written by a step brother I don&#39;t mention, because it was so small a part of my life, and not followed up on, really.  But near my dad&#39;s death, he married a woman my age who had two children.  So she was his widow, and he adopted her children, and died very soon after.   I couldn&#39;t really call someone my own age &quot;my stepmother,&quot; but legally she was.  She wasn&#39;t friendly.  She wasn&#39;t nice.  My sister and I agreed to let her have all my dad&#39;s property (two houses) and then just didn&#39;t stay in contact (calmly, turned and lived our separate lives).<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================<br/>\nThose seeds of shame have profoundly influenced my life, my sense of worth and my ability to follow through on important commitments. Even today, when I look in the mirror, what I see is an unattractive, obese slob. I often see a person who disgusts me, who is neither worthy of a good life nor of your respect. I am ashamed of my body and my weight. I am ashamed of my finances and the fact that I never finished college. I&#39;m ashamed of how I&#39;ve parented my kids, particularly the one, with whom I&#39;ve had ongoing and difficult conflicts. I&#39;m ashamed of the husband I&#39;ve been and my lack of empathy and compassion when my wife needs it most. I&#39;m ashamed to have burdened my parents with ongoing requests for financial help and support and I&#39;m ashamed of all the money that has been spent on college tuition, which never resulted in my earning a degree. When I think of my life, I often think of someone who had great potential and myriad opportunities, but who squandered all of it. I live with deep shame, which impacts every area of my life.<br/>\n==============================<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Adams, is his name, and since he established contact with me a few years ago, I&#39;ve told him a couple of times that his writing was too negative for me, and that my dad was a very cheery guy who said people could decide to be happy.  But my dad is not genetically influential in Mike&#39;s life.  Mike&#39;s mom was a downer (in all my experience, she wasn&#39;t for my dad) and Mike&#39;s biological dad was someone who didn&#39;t stick around to take care of his own children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf in your family you have a propensity to be negativy and to shame and to be ashamed, and to think of what isn&#39;t instead of what is, and of what can&#39;t be instead of what can&#39;t, then there is even MORE reason for you to find abundance and to choose up over down, and choose smile over frown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/abundance\">http://sandradodd.com/abundance</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gratitude\">http://sandradodd.com/gratitude</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joy\">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll make a dozen choices todayï¿½maybe three dozen.
