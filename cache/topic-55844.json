Great  <br/>\nstuff, all of it.  But this one is a perfect late-night learning story  <br/>\nI thought might be good to bring up front again:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh wasn&#39;t too sure about unschooling at first (about 9-10 years  <br/>\nago), and was also adamant the kids be in bed and stay there at a  <br/>\ncertain time. I&#39;d just come home from a one-day conference—probably  <br/>\nthe first time I heard Sandra speak—with an armload of interesting  <br/>\ntoys and books and a head full of inspiration. One of the books was  <br/>\nabout finding Titanic, and included a paper model, which I decided  <br/>\nMommy should put together (I really like that kind of thing :-) I was  <br/>\nworking on it after the kids had gone to bed, but then-7-y.o. Alex got  <br/>\nup. He looked at the book and we talked about it as I worked; we  <br/>\ndiscovered what a fathom was, and that Titanic came to rest on the  <br/>\ncontinental shelf, not the very bottom of the ocean, and I&#39;m sure some  <br/>\nmore interesting things, but those stick in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a half hour later, Alex went back to bed and I kept gluing. Dh  <br/>\ncame in and said, &quot;So that&#39;s unschooling.&quot; He&#39;d overheard the  <br/>\nconversation. I said, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s unschooling.&quot; Never had an  <br/>\nargument after that :-)<br/>\nNancy Wooton<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my latenight learning page, but the carnival was only for new  <br/>\nwriting.   That&#39;s good, and I approve of the policy, I just hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nwritten anything lately!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/latenightlearning\">http://sandradodd.com/latenightlearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55742,"nextTopicId":55854}}
