I forwarded it to a friend who is a high school teacher.  I thought it might be a great topic of discussion for her class.  I have always been infuriated over the disrespect shown to little people.  Especially infants.  Their minds to me are amazing and people &quot;goo-goo&quot; at them.  Idiots.  Anyway, I appreciate you sharing this.  I am a big believer in the only way we get the keys to the kingdom of heaven is with the heart of a child.  Perhaps, with freechild.org a few less hearts will be crushed.  Thanks again.<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1572768,"authorName":"Stephanie Elms","from":"&quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;stephanie.elms@...&gt;","profile":"elmsfam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"FW:  Freechild:Understanding Adultism","postDate":"1082346436","msgId":19297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1NUZENzlGRTczQUUwNDVBRjI4QUM0MkFCQTkyNDhDMjIxMkVEQGRlbHRhLW1haWwuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19305,"prevInTime":19296,"nextInTime":19298,"topicId":19297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This seemed like an interesting site...I have only starting poking around on it... ...

The word &quot;adultism&quot; <br/>\nrefers to<br/>\nbehaviors and attitudes based on the assumption that adults are better<br/>\nthan young people, and entitled to act upon young people without their<br/>\nagreement, writes John Bell. This mistreatment is reinforced by social<br/>\ninstitutions, laws, customs, and attitudes. If you think about it, you<br/>\nwill realize that except for prisoners and a few other institutionalized<br/>\ngroups, young people are more controlled than any other group in<br/>\nsociety.<br/>\nAs children, most young people are told what to eat, what to wear, when<br/>\nto go to bed, when they can talk, that they will go to school, which<br/>\nfriends are okay, and when they are to be in the house. Even as they<br/>\ngrow older, the opinions of most young people are not valued; they are<br/>\npunished at the will or whim of adults; their emotions are considered<br/>\n&quot;immature.&quot; In addition, adults reserve the right to punish, threaten,<br/>\nhit, take away &quot;privileges,&quot; and ostracize young people when such<br/>\nactions are deemed to be instrumental in controlling or disciplining<br/>\nthem. If this were a description of the way a group of adults was<br/>\ntreated, we would all agree that their oppression was almost total.<br/>\nHowever, for the most part, the adult world considers this treatment of<br/>\nyoung people as acceptable because we were treated in much the same way,<br/>\nand internalized the idea that &quot;that&#39;s the way you treat kids.&quot; For this<br/>\nreason, writes Bell, we need to hold adultism up to a strong light.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/bell.htm\">http://www.freechild.org/bell.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19303,"nextTopicId":19298}}
