If anyone <br/>\nhere practices Attachment Parenting, that organization lost a very important <br/>\nmember this week.  Christie Watts Kelly, who wrote 6 books and collaborated <br/>\nwith Dr. Sears on some of those, was killed in a car accident near her home <br/>\nin Memphis this week.  She was pregnant with her third child, who was removed <br/>\nfrom her body at 26 weeks gestation.  Baby Ian is in critical, non-stable <br/>\ncondition.  She leaves behind her husband and two young children.  The AP <br/>\ncommunity here is rallying to see what they can do to help Ian and the family <br/>\nsurvive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of her books you might recognize were Baby On The Way, and What Baby <br/>\nNeeds.  She also founded the Memphis chapter of Attachment Parenting, Int&#39;l., <br/>\ntaught yoga, and people who know her said she was the sort of person who <br/>\nglowed.  She was the kind of person the world needs more of, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-2794479-8735323&quot;\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-2794479-8735323&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-2794479-8735323&lt;/A\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-2794479-8735323&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d pass on the sad news.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Video games","postDate":"1036852614","msgId":10489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwZC4xYTllMTM3Yi4yYWZlNzc4NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10477,"nextInTopic":10492,"prevInTime":10488,"nextInTime":10490,"topicId":10477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/8/02 9:15:01 PM, starsuncloud@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-691786060\">In a message dated 11/8/02 9:15:01 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think the kids would have a different view on this.
