I&#39;d read the<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling Handbook and many other books and wanted to unschool, but<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s so SCARY when you&#39;re just getting started.  I didn&#39;t buy a<br/>\n&gt; curriculum on the theory that if I couldn&#39;t keep up with 5th grade and<br/>\n&gt; below skills, I was in pretty bad shape!  We did a little work on our<br/>\n&gt; own, but my fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants personality quickly led to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, and we&#39;ve been very happy.  Everytime people say to me that<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling 4 kids must be a lot of work, I say, &quot;not as much work as<br/>\n&gt; managing 4 kids who are in school - we&#39;ve regained a peaceful life&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re certainly not a typical family.  Lots of animals, little if any in<br/>\n&gt; the way of religious beliefs, lots of volunteer work, learning to be<br/>\n&gt; friends with heavily Christian homeschooler friends - an enlightening<br/>\n&gt; and rewarding experience, no TV restrictions, no bedtimes, conversations<br/>\n&gt; in our house I&#39;d hate to have more traditional friends see, a<br/>\n&gt; family-wide passion for the homeschool theatre group, etc.  It&#39;s nice to<br/>\n&gt; find people who are a little more like we are than the typical<br/>\n&gt; suburbanites I&#39;m surrounded by.  I hope I get to meet you guys on<br/>\n&gt; another outing - maybe on a less busy DC day?! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laurel in Burke, VA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: ElissaJC@...
