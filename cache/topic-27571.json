I&#39;m one of four siblings, so alone-time with mum was (and is) a special thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to my daughters (6 and 4 years old), well, there always was an extra bed for them around, but we hardly ever used it. There was a time when the three of us were sleeping in a single bed together, and I still love seeing those pictures (my sibs couldn&#39;t resist taking some).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried to make them sleep in their room in their own beds, but always ended up taking them back to my bed sooner (same night) or later (after a few days). Then I only occasionally felt like sleeping alone, and would tell them so. They were not happy about it, but didn&#39;t have a choice that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, we are sleeping together in a larger bed, though we might fall asleep anywhere and then I transfer us to the bed later on. Hubby is currently in a different country, so he&#39;s not in the sleeping-picture right now (and never was daily), but we were co-sleeping when with him.<br/>\nIf I happen to feel like sleeping alone, I&#39;d rather put a matress on the floor, or sleep on the sofa in the living room. I&#39;m not always there when they fall asleep or wake up anyway, so that&#39;s no big deal. And, in the morning, I sometimes like to have a few minutes alone in my bed, so I ask them to get up and give me a few minutes. They&#39;re fine with it, as long as they&#39;re together and not tired anymore. On other occasions, we start into the day by goofing around in bed till somebody has to go to the toilet. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen at my mother&#39;s place, they might sleep in almost any bed that is available there, with whoever is around at the moment (granny, granpa, uncle, his girl-friend, aunt, baby-cousin, sister, me). With the person&#39;s approval, of course. Well, in most cases. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite recently, we were relaxing at the dining/living room at my mom&#39;s place, where we have some bigger cushions that together are kind of a sofa. In the end, my mum was snuggled up on them, sleeping, with me sitting beside her and reading a newspaper. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnastasia,<br/>\n2 dd&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

But the reluctant one is my third child.<br/>\n6yo Anika.  My parents always made a big deal with my kids about how much<br/>\nfun they were going to have at grandma and grandpa&#39;s house.  They reminded<br/>\nthe kids that there would be a video and popcorn and coke and bed-rides<br/>\n(riding on the cushions while grandpa opens and closes the convertible<br/>\nsofa:) etc. etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe two older kids love to go and always have but the youngest doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nto be left without me.  I looked at the situation carefully trying to see it<br/>\nthrough her eyes and what I came up with was that the rents were already so<br/>\nbusy with their routines they had (for years) established with the other<br/>\nkids (and their cousins) that Anika was kind of left out or a tagalong.  And<br/>\nhere&#39;s the important part.  My folks treated her as though she just didn&#39;t<br/>\nget how fun this was all supposed to be.  Instead of meeting her where she<br/>\nwas, they expected her to do what they had planned (hmmmm).  They didn&#39;t<br/>\nmean to be cruel but the more Anika resisted the flow, the more &quot;disapproval<br/>\n&quot; of her came out in their voices and words ... then the more she&#39;d pout or<br/>\ncry or not participate leading to more disapproving words or attempts to<br/>\ntrick her into having a good time.  No wonder she didn&#39;t like to go, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to be treated like that.  I immediately stopped making her<br/>\nstay without me and I started putting myself into the fun sessions so she<br/>\ncould be comfortable.  If I had insisted (on leaving her) I believe her<br/>\nrelationship with them would have continued going downhill.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy folks still are not inclined to understand her issue.  They figure she&#39;s<br/>\njust hard to please ... What kid wouldn&#39;t want candy and a movie and popcorn<br/>\nand coke?  But unlike the cousins, and to some extent the older sibs who<br/>\nwere born earlier in our unschooling learning curve, Anika has never had<br/>\nrestrictions from TV or candy or soda.  Those things are not powerful enough<br/>\nto mask a subtle (or not so subtle ) disapproval of her.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy point is not that your situation is just like ours, but really taking<br/>\nyour daughter seriously, and meeting her need out of empathy and<br/>\nunderstanding is truly the way to go.  Then you may find you have to be<br/>\ncreative about your needs since your plan A didn&#39;t work to get them met.<br/>\nYour needs and your husband&#39;s *are* important but they aren&#39;t more important<br/>\nthan her needs and yours can be met in another way that doesn&#39;t force her to<br/>\nstop listening to her feelings in order to please you.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you show respect and ingenuity now, when she is more comfortable later<br/>\nyou can always go back to leaving them at your mom&#39;s.

Also, as I recall with my own girls as well as having read it in my developmental books, that at around age 7 girls tend to prefer mom and are identifiying more with her and practising being a &quot;mom&quot; or female. The opposite for boys around that age, identifying with their dad&#39;s instead. My dh had a job that took him away from home a lot, so ds still spent most of his time with me. All of my kids have gone through varying degrees of seperation anxiety, and all at different ages & stages. Even a change from one month to the next. Sometimes something has happened at a visit with friends or neighbours that made them feel uncomfortable, but they cannot express it in words and simply don&#39;t want to go. My in-laws do not live close & I never left my kids with them till they were older. Then it was for 2 hours while DH & I went to a movie. They told us to never leave them alone again as they were mean and said bad things about me. They tried to convince them they needed to go to school or they would be stupid. Told them that we were feeding them bad food (mostly organic whole foods). They were being deprived because chocolate bars & pop were not an everyday part of our diet. I went on & on. So they never stayed alone with them again. Then several years later MIL &quot;HAD&quot; to go to the store to buy cigarettes & asked Amanda to go, she agreed. When they got back only a few minutes later Amanda came tearing into the house bawling her eyes out. MIL had pulled it again about the homeschooling. That was the very last time alone with them. They would also tell me in front of the kids that I needed to spank them to smarten them up & my SIL would get in on it as well. Even to the point of asking her girls in front of mine what would happen to them in the same situation & they would say, &quot;mommy would hit us and spank us&quot;. At which time I would take my kids into a bedroom and we would all try to calm down. And they wondered why we chose to live so far away. My parents weren&#39;t much better. They are more passive-aggressive and weren&#39;t as obvious in their remarks. My older kids did go to stay with them for 5 days when we were building the house. They wanted to go. It was fine and they said it was okay. But that was in 1998 and they haven&#39;t been back since. My parents aren&#39;t kid people for more than a few hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of unschooling is respecting our kids needs. So I would meet your dds needs. Whenever you go to do something, offer her to help you. Then it is her choice or not. Before she goes out to ride her bike, let her know you are going to be doing something she might like to do with you & give her the choice on what to do &/or offer to call her in when you go to do it. As they get older they tend to be less needy only because they are busier doing their own stuff. But they really do still need the contact & by the time they realize it, they are almost suddenly realizing it & then painfully missing you. My kids will have a great time doing something else with someone else, but I find they then need extra attention from me to refill their &quot;need for mommy time&quot; tanks. I find once they get that extra attention that they ease themselves back into needing less again. These stages will continue to cycle back & forth though, so this is probably not the first or last time she will hit this type of a stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerri, mom to Amanda(16), Emma(14), Maddison(12), T(11, foster dd), A(10, foster ds), Jonah(10), Saige & Claire(6, monozygotic twin dds), M(6, foster dd), S(4, foster ds) & little boy Teagan(3).

It&#39;s a comfort to know there are other unschoolers<br/>\nout there. Sometimes our lifestyle seems so free and easy that I know<br/>\nmost people wouldn&#39;t understand. This group is a wonderful support<br/>\nsystem for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hoping someone will have some insights/experiences to share with me.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do with my 7-year-old daughter, Lauren.<br/>\nWe&#39;re unschoolers (of course) so she is almost always with me. I feel<br/>\nlike this particular challenge I&#39;m facing is very intertwined with<br/>\nunschooling and attachment parenting, but especially with the freedom<br/>\nof unschooling.<br/>\nOnce or twice a week I sometimes drop her off at my in-laws for a few<br/>\nhours and it&#39;s almost always an ordeal. She has what seems like a<br/>\nseparation anxiety attack. Usually I stay for a few minutes and she<br/>\nbecomes more comfortable. This past Saturday, I attempted to leave<br/>\nher with her brother (3 yrs old and could hardly care less that I&#39;m<br/>\nleaving), and she started crying. I ended up taking her to Jazzercise<br/>\nwith me. Then after Jazzercise I explained that her father & I need<br/>\nsome time together, and that I was taking her back to my in-laws for<br/>\nawhile. She said no, she didn&#39;t want to go. I asked why not. She<br/>\njust said, &quot;I want to be with you. I want to go home.&quot; So, I<br/>\nexplained again that sometimes Mommy and Daddy need time alone<br/>\ntogether to talk and that relationships take a bit of work. Anyway, in<br/>\nthe end, she got in the car and I couldn&#39;t get her out. (of course my<br/>\nmil had to offer her two cents and tell me to &quot;punish&quot; her and make<br/>\nher stay in her room all afternoon...come on, she knows I wouldn&#39;t do<br/>\nthat. I often forget how much of the world does things).<br/>\nI did ask Lauren how I could make it easy for her to stay....and I<br/>\neven asked her if I could get her her favorite Ben & Jerry&#39;s ice<br/>\ncream! (this isn&#39;t a technique I advocate or am proud of attempting).<br/>\nShe wouldn&#39;t take me up on it. I was very disappointed that she<br/>\nseemed indifferent to my request. I told her that if she came home<br/>\nwith me, there would be no TV until the evening (she usually enjoys<br/>\nwatching videos to relax when she gets tired in the afternoon). I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever made the TV off limits before, but I was really trying to offer<br/>\nher an incentive to stay at my in-laws (they have videos too...and<br/>\ngames - my mil plays with her for hours, and crafts, and scooters,<br/>\netc.) and was feeling very frustrated. My husband & I hadn&#39;t had any<br/>\ntime alone in a few weeks and I hadn&#39;t had time by myself in a long<br/>\ntime. While feeling really irritated, I huffed that I rarely request<br/>\nher to do anything! Then she offered to help with chores and said<br/>\nthat she wished I would ask for her help with the dishes and laundry<br/>\n(she used to help me, but lately she&#39;s been more interested in bicycle<br/>\nriding and being outside). When we got home, she made &quot;love notes&quot;<br/>\nfor me and told me how she just wants to be with me (we do things<br/>\ntogether every day!). Now I&#39;m trying to get an understanding of what<br/>\nshe is needing/wanting from me, and I&#39;m wondering what I can do or say<br/>\nto help her honor my request so that this coming Saturday I will be<br/>\nsuccessful in leaving her at my in-laws for a few hours (we both have<br/>\nneeds, don&#39;t we). What kind of developmental milestone is she working<br/>\nthrough? The truth is that we can usually talk things out and I&#39;m<br/>\nable to get her input on situations to solve problems with win-win<br/>\nsolutions. This particular situation has me stumped!<br/>\nAny ideas? <br/>\nThanks for your help!,<br/>\nDeanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174713482,"authorName":"Carmen Roa","from":"Carmen Roa &lt;tredjam1@...&gt;","profile":"tredjam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: OT - separation anxiety of 7 year old","postDate":"1167840217","msgId":27579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTAzMTYwMzM4LjIzMTgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27578,"nextInTopic":27580,"prevInTime":27578,"nextInTime":27580,"topicId":27571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Group, I d like to add my .02 to this thread and ask for  comments/suggestions from other Attachment Parenting practitioners.

However much my kids need and want to be with me, they travel (one is in Austin with his brother for 10 days, and one went to Mexico City for 10 days recently), talk to new acquaintances with poise and clarity, an are in general just awesome people who happen to live in small bodies for the moment.And they cry on the phone when we talk while they are away, saying that they miss me so, but then they continue having a great time. . <br/>\n     My question/request for comments is &quot;How long does attachment parenting go on?&quot; <br/>\n  Despite knowing that my  adult kids didn&#39;t go to college sleeping in Mom&#39;s bed, it is still uncomfortable to be criticized for parenting practices.<br/>\n    I appreciate this board and the good discussions that come out of here!<br/>\n  Carmen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    You can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection <br/>\n  than you are yourself, <br/>\nand you will not find that person anywhere.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Carmen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

But this post","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1523712563\">I&#39;m a new member of this group.  My first post.  Have enjoyed reading the messages.  Every post seems to possess something that sticks with me.  But this post was a very timely.  We recently started along the path of uncoiling.  We have been married 7 years.  I became a step mom to a 7 year old at that time. Ian was already in the public school system.  Never thought of pulling him out.  His father and I both worked full time.  We share jointed custody with Ian&#39;s mom.  We had a daughter two years later.  I continued to work.  Cora was able to stay with friends and family while I worked.  In the fall of 2005, we decided to find a school for Cora.  It was the hardest thing I had ever done.  Homeschooling and unschooled never crossed our minds.  Never knew anyone who had done it.  Wasn&#39;t part of our daily lives.  The more we looked for schools the more anxious I became.  How many kids/teacher????? 10-15???  For some reason I began asking potential schools , &quot;What if my 3 year<br/>\n old says the world is really flat?&quot;  Most of the &quot;teachers&quot; responded they would keep correcting her until she agreed.  Really argue with a 3 year was always my response.  Then I quickly got out.  We did finally find a school.  A Montessori school.  Which fit us the best.  But was still lacking in so many ways!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n    In May when my contract was ready to be renewed, we decided we couldn&#39;t send her back to school.  We decided then I would be a stay at home mom.  Still hadn&#39;t decided about homeschool/unschool.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As the months have gone by, we have began learning so much at home.  My husband and I began talking about homeschooling (still didn&#39;t know about unschooling).  It made so much sense to us.  But we instantly became a freak show in our family.  SO many opinions!  But we knew it fit our family. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Then I went on the search for curriculum.  I read books about what every kindergarten should know.  Joined groups.  Had play dates.  But many of the parents couldn&#39;t come to play dates because they had a test today.  The more I read about homeschooling the more I began to feel foreign again.  I don&#39;t want us to &quot;miss&quot; things because I have to give Cora a test. Now I am with homeschoolers and still feel as if I don&#39;t belong.  I would be asked.  What curriculum are you planning to use?  Well she is only in K.  I think I can teach her K material without a curriculum.  Then I would receive to look!  You know the one, the one that says this woman is in over her head and doesn&#39;t know it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Then I met  wonderful person who overheard this conversation and suggested unschooling.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Unschooling??  I looked into this topic.  Read about it.  IT FITS!  Wow I&#39;m so excited.  This is what I was doing already.  I&#39;m not a freak.  Well I really am.  I usually liked being different.  But when it could possibly affect my children I began to panic.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I read this post about separation anxiety and then read everyone responses and felt as if everything was written with me in mind.  I go though stages where it is so hard to have my daughter with me all the time.  I feel as if I am so tired all the time.  I would love to have time with my husband.  But when our daughter is playing in her room or watching Blues Clue, I just want to catch a quick nap.  Read a little.  I don&#39;t have the energy to have a quickie with my husband.  I got married at 38, had a baby at 40, became a stay at home mom at 44.  My life has changed so much in 7 years.  I love staying home and learning with my daughter.  We have so much fun together.  But about twice a week I feel as if I&#39;m about to lose my patience with her. And I know it is not her, its me.  I begin feeling jealous about not having any alone time.  my time.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  your post have helped me return to reality.  there is plenty of time for me.  thanks.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  terry <br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

This past Saturday, I attempted to leave<br/>\nher with her brother (3 yrs old and could hardly care less that I&#39;m<br/>\nleaving), and she started crying.  I ended up taking her to Jazzercise<br/>\nwith me.  Then after Jazzercise I explained that her father & I need<br/>\nsome time together, and that I was taking her back to my in-laws for<br/>\nawhile.  She said no, she didn&#39;t want to go.  I asked why not.  She<br/>\njust said, &quot;I want to be with you.  I want to go home.&quot;  So, I<br/>\nexplained again that sometimes Mommy and Daddy need time alone<br/>\ntogether to talk and that relationships take a bit of work. Anyway, in<br/>\nthe end, she got in the car and I couldn&#39;t get her out.  (of course my<br/>\nmil had to offer her two cents and tell me to &quot;punish&quot; her and make<br/>\nher stay in her room all afternoon...come on, she knows I wouldn&#39;t do<br/>\nthat. I often forget how much of the world does things).<br/>\nI did ask Lauren how I could make it easy for her to stay....and I<br/>\neven asked her if I could get her her favorite Ben & Jerry&#39;s ice<br/>\ncream!  (this isn&#39;t a technique I advocate or am proud of attempting).<br/>\nShe wouldn&#39;t take me up on it.  I was very disappointed that she<br/>\nseemed indifferent to my request.  I told her that if she came home<br/>\nwith me, there would be no TV until the evening (she usually enjoys<br/>\nwatching videos to relax when she gets tired in the afternoon).  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever made the TV off limits before, but I was really trying to offer<br/>\nher an incentive to stay at my in-laws (they have videos too...and<br/>\ngames - my mil plays with her for hours, and crafts, and scooters,<br/>\netc.) and was feeling very frustrated.  My husband & I hadn&#39;t had any<br/>\ntime alone in a few weeks and I hadn&#39;t had time by myself in a long<br/>\ntime.  While feeling really irritated, I huffed that I rarely request<br/>\nher to do anything!  Then she offered to help with chores and said<br/>\nthat she wished I would ask for her help with the dishes and laundry<br/>\n(she used to help me, but lately she&#39;s been more interested in bicycle<br/>\nriding and being outside).  When we got home, she made &quot;love notes&quot;<br/>\nfor me and told me how she just wants to be with me (we do things<br/>\ntogether every day!).   Now I&#39;m trying to get an understanding of what<br/>\nshe is needing/wanting from me, and I&#39;m wondering what I can do or say<br/>\nto help her honor my request so that this coming Saturday I will be<br/>\nsuccessful in leaving her at my in-laws for a few hours (we both have<br/>\nneeds, don&#39;t we). What kind of developmental milestone is she working<br/>\nthrough?  The truth is that we can usually talk things out and I&#39;m<br/>\nable to get her input on situations to solve problems with win-win<br/>\nsolutions.  This particular situation has me stumped!<br/>\nAny ideas?  <br/>\nThanks for your help!,<br/>\nDeanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27568,"nextTopicId":27507}}
