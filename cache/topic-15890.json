I had been skimming and hadn&#39;t <br/>\nnoticed.  Also staring at my garden at night and in the morning, and <br/>\neverytime I pass it, watching the squash and sunflowers and other things <br/>\ngrowing so fast you can almost watch their growth.  Watching my collie <br/>\ncross take a bite out of a great big squash leaf and then look at me and <br/>\nlaugh (&quot;See, I didn&#39;t get IN the garden, I just bit the leaf!&quot;)  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever seen an animal with such a sense of humor, she laughs and grins <br/>\n(and others are scared of her cause they aren&#39;t used to grinning big <br/>\ndogs.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we went to see Spy Kids 3.  Not worth the money, in my <br/>\nopinion, and we even got in free (birthday party--never expected them to <br/>\npay but they did).  The best part was at the very end, after the credits <br/>\nwhen they ran home movies of Juni and Carmen when they were younger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re listening to a tape about the donner party, in prep for our trip <br/>\nto the donner pass.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-118187896\">I&#39;ve been lurking in this group for a while.  The more I read, the more convinced I am that I&#39;ve come &quot;home.&quot;  I&#39;m a radical unschooler, gentle parent.  I heard somewhere that a parent&#39;s only real job is to find out what their children really want and encourage them to do it.  That clicked with me.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do feel compelled to address this issue of new people.  I think there are a lot of really stupid people in the world.  &quot;Sheeple&quot; I&#39;ve heard them called.  I used to be a sheeple.  I also think there are stupid questions (&quot;do you want me to hit you?&quot; for instance.)  However, we can all be stupid, even arrogant, about things we&#39;re ignorant of, and if new people aren&#39;t allowed to ask questions without others taking their silly insinuations personally, then what is the point?  We can&#39;t control other people anyway, or get them to stop doing what makes us uncomfortable.  We can&#39;t unschool our children gently but tell other parents that they shouldn&#39;t ask questions.<br/>\n <br/>\nI lurk because that is my m.o.  I stick my toes in the pool and then sit down and think about it.  Now my daughter, she never hesitates or even tests the water, she jumps in at the deep end.  I think both learning styles are good and appropriate.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I started homeschooling I hated the regimentation, but I was convinced that &quot;letting go absolutely&quot; of an agenda would not only land me in jail, but would leave my kid shortchanged, convinced she was unloved.  (That was stupid!)  After a while and with a lot of coaching I realized that acting on those fears was actually admitting that I didn&#39;t trust my children.  I didn&#39;t trust in their own innate wisdom and goodness - painful realization, as I fancied myself one terrific, conscientious mother.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had to see this first, then from there it wasn&#39;t a big jump to deciding that trusting them was the only thing I could do.  I got out of my head and into my heart where I knew the truth - that they are good, trustworthy and capable, and that I&#39;m not the all-powerful Oz (but am also good, trustworthy and capable, sometimes stupid.)  We are both whole human beings, nothing left out.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve been homeschooling for 1.5 years now after a stint in a Waldorf school, following a couple of years &quot;sentence&quot; in (god forgive me) public school.  I know my daughter is healing because she started mocking my aerobic dance workout - very funny.  I&#39;ve decided not to feel guilty for neglecting their education all those years &quot;in school&quot; because they tell me all the time how happy they are to be free.  They thank me for doing what I do.<br/>\n <br/>\nNewcomers should be treated like adopted children - give them a lot of slack, tenderness, and time to catch up.  Remember that their sometimes sarcastic insinuations are the pain that they bring with them from other places, it&#39;s only about you if you decide to take it on.  Trust in their innate goodness and wisdom, even if it&#39;s been covered up by years in an institution.  Someone gave me that tolerance, or I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI loved the volunteer pumpkin story - can now grow up to be a good citizen.  Sophisticated group!!<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta Fontana<br/>\n&quot;Government, like fire, is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.&quot; G.
