Alone time, not being able <br/>\nto stop just any old time, friends... It&#39;s not like we would be in a mobile <br/>\nhome! Here in our current town, the kids just don&#39;t have that may friends. Sad <br/>\nbut true. Although we realize that going out on the road would prevent making <br/>\nfriends in a new town. We have been discussing going out with Darin six to nine <br/>\nmonths out of the year. Darin doesn&#39;t want us with him during the winter <br/>\nmonths as he will be doing most of his runs through the West over the Rocky and <br/>\nSierra Nevada Mountains, and into Canada, although he will do some East Coast <br/>\nruns too. Then the kids and I would either rent a place or stay with my folks, <br/>\nor visit other family. He gets two to three days off every ten to fourteen days <br/>\nand he can save his days up by working through four or five weeks and then <br/>\ntaking a week off. That way we could do extra things like stopping at Dinosaur <br/>\nWorld. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 4/10/04 08:09:58 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:si1verkitten@...\">si1verkitten@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI would be very tempted, personally.

He got hired by a great company out of Springfield, Missouri and <br/>\nis now on the road with a trainer and will get his own truck at the end of his <br/>\ntraining period. (90 days) Since he left for school and then started with <br/>\nthis company we haven&#39;t seen him for more than two or three days every few weeks. <br/>\nWe did expect this and the kids are adjusting to it, better than Darin and I <br/>\nare at this point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we are at a big decision point. None of us like it here in our town <br/>\nand have been wanting to move for some time. We have a few options. One, we <br/>\n(the kids and I) can move to Springfield and we would be able to see Darin a <br/>\nlittle more and we would be in a town that has lots more to offer than the one <br/>\nwe live in now. And we can take turns going with Darin on runs as the company <br/>\nallows one rider at a time in company trucks. Or two, Darin can get his own <br/>\ntruck (expensive, but the company offers a great program to get your own truck <br/>\nand work for them making even more money than as a company driver) and we can <br/>\nall go with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have met two different families that do this. One family has a small child <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t &quot;school age&quot; and they all go together with the plan that when <br/>\ntheir son reaches school age she and the son will find a home in Springfield so he <br/>\ncan go to school. The other family has kids our kids ages and they sold <br/>\neverything, have a mail box at the company store, (to establish residency in <br/>\nMissouri because of lenient hsing laws there) and they do school at home on the road <br/>\nand their kids love it. Although the mother of that family did express the <br/>\nconcern about us being unschoolers, but we get that from school at home folks <br/>\nanyway. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are split on this decision. Darin and I both realize that living in a <br/>\ntruck is unconventional, the trucks are big, but not that big, the kids would have <br/>\nto give up lots of things and we would too. But we would all be together and <br/>\nthat is really what we all want the most. OTOH, Springfield has lots to offer <br/>\nand I would love to live in that area. We have looked into the cost <br/>\ndifferences, between a house payment, utilities, etc... and living in the truck (truck <br/>\npayments, food on the road, we would have a small fridge in the truck) and the <br/>\ncosts are about the same, living on the road being slightly (read not much) <br/>\ncheaper. Darin would make almost three times as much as an owner than as a <br/>\ncompany driver. But the costs aren&#39;t what is making the decision difficult because <br/>\neven now in his training period Darin is making twice what he made before. I <br/>\nguess the difficulty in the decision boils down to logistics, comfort, living <br/>\nthat close to each other ... and things like would we be depriving the kids of <br/>\nthings that they would have living in one place vs. the opportunity to see all <br/>\nsorts of places in the US and Canada, the ability to drop a load off and say <br/>\nwe like it here, lets hang out for a few days before we call and say we are <br/>\nready to take the next load. Like Darin said, if the kids and I didn&#39;t like it, <br/>\nit&#39;s not like we couldn&#39;t get a place to live. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering what some of you would think, presented with an idea like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19280,"nextTopicId":19284}}
