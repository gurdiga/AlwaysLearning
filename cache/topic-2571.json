She<br/>\ngave up naps at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm ... now that I&#39;m thinking of it, breastfeeding was for hunger followed<br/>\nby a nap. When she was hungry at other than nap time (she fell into a<br/>\nnatural schedule that she readjusted herself as she needed fewer and fewer<br/>\nnaps) she ate food which she enjoyed so I didn&#39;t get any feedback that she<br/>\nwas being deprived. If she was hurt I hugged her just because it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave occured to me to make a connection between pain and food. If I need a<br/>\nculture to make that connection for me, then is the connection strongly<br/>\nbiological? In a culture where infants are nursed when they cry regardless<br/>\nof the cause, is it done because that&#39;s natural or because there is social<br/>\npressure to do so to quiet the infant because so many people are living so<br/>\nclose together? Or is it both? I suspect that children are adaptable and can<br/>\nfind comfort in a number of ways so ultimately the decision of what way is<br/>\nbest is whatever fits best with the society.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps there were clues from my daughter that I was missing but if the<br/>\nclues were that subtle, then how biologically necessary were they? I&#39;d<br/>\nreally hate to have women feel guilty if their child weans early. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s much more nurturing to help women ignore the cultural pressures that<br/>\nencourage them to wean early rather than to shame them into nursing as long<br/>\nas possible because some have decided it isn&#39;t natural to wean early and to<br/>\neven set a specific year before which they claim it would be unnatural to<br/>\nstop nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve never read anthropological research about, say a<br/>\n&gt; !Kung child who weans at a year - it would be suicide in that<br/>\n&gt; environment, and that&#39;s the environment we all evolved in, and lived in<br/>\n&gt; until the very recent past.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people. The Polynesians, for instance, grew up in a land of plenty. (I<br/>\nwonder at what age their children weaned before western influence?) I&#39;d say<br/>\nnursing and weaning -- as with most of human biology -- is adaptable to the<br/>\nenvironment so children can get what they need in the best way. Our<br/>\nadaptability is what has allowed us to be so successful in exploiting a wide<br/>\nvariety of environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went looking for some report about the Polynesians and weaning but came<br/>\nacross a report of how certain tribes find mothers and fathers sexually<br/>\nstimulating infants to be perfectly normal and calming for them, where there<br/>\nwas a strong connection between nursing and sexual stimulation.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm\">http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm</a> -- the reseach appears to<br/>\nhave all done by men and seems chock full of bias but that doesn&#39;t negate<br/>\nthe practices they observed regardless of what conclusions they drew from<br/>\nthem.)

Did you use<br/>\n&gt; substitute nipples of any kind (pacifiers, bottles, etc.)? Were you<br/>\n&gt; available to nurse, or did you put your child on a nursing schedule or<br/>\n&gt; spend a good bit of time away from him/her? Did you often try to distract<br/>\n&gt; a child who wanted to nurse? Did you night-wean your infant (&gt;1 yr, some<br/>\n&gt; say &lt; 2 years)? Because our culture is so breastfeeding-unfirnedly, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; easy to slip into weaning your child without meaning to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know lots and lots of people who intentionally did *not* do any of this<br/>\n&gt; weaning-behaviors, and none of their children weaned before 2... the<br/>\n&gt; average was 3 to 4. I&#39;ve never read anthropological research about, say a<br/>\n&gt; !Kung child who weans at a year - it would be suicide in that<br/>\n&gt; environment, and that&#39;s the environment we all evolved in, and lived in<br/>\n&gt; until the very recent past. Kathy Dettwyler has done some rearch on this,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s available on the LLL site.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;decided to be independent by  their first<br/>\n&gt; birthday&quot;, and maybe that attitude towards nursing is part of why your<br/>\n&gt; child stopped nursing so young. Weaning has *nothing* to do with<br/>\n&gt; &quot;deciding to be independent&quot; - my daughter was still nursing when she<br/>\n&gt; performed with a dance group at 3 1/2, plus by that age she was regularly<br/>\n&gt; walking across to the hall and going to play with the kids over there,<br/>\n&gt; and outside... she was swimming by herself, reading simple stories to<br/>\n&gt; herself, etc., etc.... doing lots of things independently. Again, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; our culture that has decided that nursing is a sign of dependency, unless<br/>\n&gt; you also want to consider being hugged or read to a sign of dependency...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dar<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\n&gt; Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\n&gt; Join Juno today!

Did you use<br/>\nsubstitute nipples of any kind (pacifiers, bottles, etc.)? Were you<br/>\navailable to nurse, or did you put your child on a nursing schedule or<br/>\nspend a good bit of time away from him/her? Did you often try to distract<br/>\na child who wanted to nurse? Did you night-wean your infant (&gt;1 yr, some<br/>\nsay &lt; 2 years)? Because our culture is so breastfeeding-unfirnedly, it&#39;s<br/>\neasy to slip into weaning your child without meaning to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know lots and lots of people who intentionally did *not* do any of this<br/>\nweaning-behaviors, and none of their children weaned before 2... the<br/>\naverage was 3 to 4. I&#39;ve never read anthropological research about, say a<br/>\n!Kung child who weans at a year - it would be suicide in that<br/>\nenvironment, and that&#39;s the environment we all evolved in, and lived in<br/>\nuntil the very recent past. Kathy Dettwyler has done some rearch on this,<br/>\nit&#39;s available on the LLL site. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;decided to be independent by  their first<br/>\nbirthday&quot;, and maybe that attitude towards nursing is part of why your<br/>\nchild stopped nursing so young. Weaning has *nothing* to do with<br/>\n&quot;deciding to be independent&quot; - my daughter was still nursing when she<br/>\nperformed with a dance group at 3 1/2, plus by that age she was regularly<br/>\nwalking across to the hall and going to play with the kids over there,<br/>\nand outside... she was swimming by herself, reading simple stories to<br/>\nherself, etc., etc.... doing lots of things independently. Again, it&#39;s<br/>\nour culture that has decided that nursing is a sign of dependency, unless<br/>\nyou also want to consider being hugged or read to a sign of dependency...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
