That used to be the local <br/>\nadvice I gave here, when there was an unschooling meeting regularly--COME and <br/>\nmeet the older kids and you&#39;ll be sold.  They&#39;re just so different, so <br/>\npoised, so real to talk to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s interesting the other people they draw, too.  They&#39;re good <br/>\ninfluences on more structured homeschoolers, when the parents get to know <br/>\nmine (and some others I&#39;m thinking of in New Mexico) better.  Their fears and <br/>\nexpectations thaw out some.  And the couple of school kids who hang out here <br/>\na lot soften up after the first hour or so.  It&#39;s sweet to see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday there were four teen boys here, and Holly, playing video games in <br/>\nKirby&#39;s room.  They were letting Holly have turns (she&#39;s ten) and she was <br/>\nVERY happy to have come in second on one game, and not lost all of them.  (It <br/>\nwas the crazy characters-teams smash brothers?? where you choose characters <br/>\nfrom other Nintendo games to be, I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSO there was a lot of yelling from there, and once in a while I&#39;d hear <br/>\nsomething I would have liked to have edited out &quot;You &#39;tard&quot; or &quot;Screw YOU!&quot; <br/>\nand after a while it got physical between Marty and his (smaller but more <br/>\ndetermined) friend Logan, and they were wrestling and pinning each other, so <br/>\nI was alert to listen for anyone getting hurt or angry.  But through it all I <br/>\nwas thinking how much truly exuberant fun they were having.  There were no <br/>\nvictims.  They were all having honest, clean, safe (relatively, they were <br/>\nwrestling on a bed and on carpet, in the presence of others with a mom two <br/>\nrooms away) fun.  If anyone HAD started to have hurt feelings, Kirby would <br/>\nhave been the first to make things right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something very cool about them:  They will tell neat stories about <br/>\neach other.  They&#39;re no so needy of attention and validation that their <br/>\nstories are usually about themselves.  It&#39;s common for Kirby to come home <br/>\nwhen they&#39;ve been out and tell me smething really smooth Marty did, or <br/>\nsomething nice someone said about Holly, and so forth throughout the group.  <br/>\nAnd their friends, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Kirby was at anime club.  His friends are starting to drive now, <br/>\nand one (schooled kid, who loves school for band and an after-school <br/>\naccelerated Japanese class, and because he&#39;s an only child and really enjoys <br/>\nthe other people) brought him and another homeschooler home and they&#39;re all <br/>\nin Kirby&#39;s room asleep.  So he got back who-knows when (4:00 probably), but I <br/>\nknew where he was (at Lobo Comics), who he was with (and had two cell phone <br/>\nnumbers) and wher he is right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen other parents want ideas and reject all mine, it&#39;s a mystery.  They want <br/>\nme to tell them how their kids can be as trustworthy as mine without them <br/>\ntrusting them.  And they want to know how their kids can be as direct as mine <br/>\nwithout the parents allowing directness, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the compliment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"ddzimlew@juno.com","from":"ddzimlew@...","profile":"mom2zimmy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]  Asking","postDate":"1012618053","msgId":3932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjAxLjE5NDczOS4tOTUyOTY1LjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3920,"nextInTopic":3951,"prevInTime":3931,"nextInTime":3933,"topicId":3884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
