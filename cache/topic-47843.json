It was a struggle, because I had just had extensive reconstructive surgery on my dominant hand and was working hard to write legibly with my left hand.  But the phrases really rang in my head, and so I struggled to get them down.  The words spoke volumes to me in terms of my own personal worries, societal expectations, and strivings -- both for myself and my son.  Wise words, indeed.  I keep them in a little file of scraps and bits of paper with quotes I jot down, my own personal salve for times when I start to panic or lose trust in our unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third quote was this:  &quot;For learning to take place there must be:  <br/>\n             comprehension; <br/>\n             interest; <br/>\n             confidence <br/>\n             and assistance when we seek it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like unschooling to me  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"the company you keep","postDate":"1255033695","msgId":47843,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENFOEM4NkYwLUQ5QTctNDAxRC05MTU5LTQzMjZBQTQzRTU2REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47871,"prevInTime":47842,"nextInTime":47844,"topicId":47843,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Keep company with those who make you better. ~ English saying That was in Laura Endres (picesgrrrl s) sigline.

If  <br/>\nanyone&#39;s in the mood to find a quote, that would be awesome.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nabout to need to go to physical therapy and I don&#39;t know right where  <br/>\nmy copy of that book is anyway.  I mean, it&#39;s in my office but that  <br/>\nhardly narrows the search these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing friends seems random sometimes, but I think maybe that&#39;s  <br/>\nanother holdover from school.  We don&#39;t have to &quot;be friends&quot; in a  <br/>\nbosom-buddy deep-trust kind of way with co-workers or others are  <br/>\nchurch or even with other unschoolers.  It&#39;s okay to have  <br/>\nacquaintances we&#39;re friendly with and to be talkative and smiley, but  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to have a few people you can really trust.   <br/>\nThey don&#39;t even have to be people you know.  I pretty much trust Frank  <br/>\nSmith. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people aren&#39;t discriminating in the people they trust, their kids  <br/>\nmight not learn to be either.  I don&#39;t mean to lecture or &quot;teach&quot;  <br/>\nthem, but jut to keep it in mind, and not to bring too many  <br/>\nuntrustworthy people into their lives if you can help it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some friends who drain me for various reasons.  Often they&#39;re  <br/>\nso fun I don&#39;t mind at all.  I have friends who fill me up, and I&#39;m  <br/>\ncareful not to ask it too often, considering that I might be a drain  <br/>\non their energy myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a couple of months my mind has been full of flitting thoughts of  <br/>\nreliability and integrity (and also swine flu for a week and some,  <br/>\npain killers for the past month, so I&#39;ll admit that).   How many lies  <br/>\nmake a person a liar?  How many chances should we give siblings or  <br/>\nparents or neighbors or friends before we distance ourselves?   It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot worth getting mad at an unreliable person for being unreliable,  <br/>\nnor in some cases to be angry at a liar for lying.   Some people lie.   <br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m in a position to try and change their minds about it,  <br/>\nbut my missionary/volunteer work is about unschooling and parenting,  <br/>\nnot about truthtelling.  So I distance myself from them and figure  <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to keep doing what they&#39;re doing.  I hope those people  <br/>\nwho trust me will not be caused to regret it (by maintaining my own  <br/>\nintegrity) and that those who don&#39;t will find some other people to  <br/>\nhang out with and be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m rambling, and I&#39;ve kinda rambled myself into a corner, but that  <br/>\nsigline quote was perfect to set to flitting around with my other  <br/>\nthoughts lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest reward of being good is being a good person.   &quot;Virtue is  <br/>\nits own reward.&quot;  I think that&#39;s a saying in just about every language  <br/>\non the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47827,"nextTopicId":47768}}
