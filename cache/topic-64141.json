My 11 yo kids, each at that age, would have<br/>\nnot been happy spending a lot of time on their own or with their sisters<br/>\n(older or younger). My oldest, especially, needed a LOT of time with other<br/>\nkids - tons and tons more than I&#39;d have thought. Things went a lot smoother<br/>\nwhen my oldest had a friend over to hang out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s not feeling engaged in stuff going on around the house - not super<br/>\ninvolved in things he has available, that&#39;s when your role as an<br/>\nunschooling parent becomes really really important. Pay attention to what<br/>\nDOES absorb him. What lights him up? Think about what it is about it that<br/>\nhe enjoys. Do two things (or more) -- jazz up his experience of that thing<br/>\nand find other things that might offer a similar kind of experience. For<br/>\nexample, if building with Legos was one of the things he DOES get absorbed<br/>\nand engaged in --- get more legos and get the robotic stuff and subscribe<br/>\nto lego magazine and --- well, people here can tell you all the lego<br/>\n&quot;expansions&quot; there are. Start planning a trip to Legoland in Southern<br/>\nCalifornia (there are homeschool days). So that&#39;s the &quot;jazz it up&quot; part.<br/>\nThe second thing is to notice that he really likes building stuff. So think<br/>\nabout what else he might like that is building-related - Home Depot does<br/>\nworkshops for kids about building things like birdhouses. Minecraft is ALL<br/>\nabout building cool stuff. Anyway - just examples of what I mean by &quot;jazz<br/>\nit up&quot; and &quot;extend it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - a 3 yo is likely pestering the 11 yo and really interfering with<br/>\nhis peace. Be aware of that and protect the 11 yo&#39;s stuff and his quiet and<br/>\nmake sure he is getting attention paid to his needs. It doesn&#39;t mean the 11<br/>\nyo won&#39;t love the 3 yo, but that&#39;s a big age difference and an 11 yo boy<br/>\nmay very understandably not have much patience for a 3 yo&#39;s behavior. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound like &quot;disrespectful&quot; behavior to me - it sounds like annoyed<br/>\nand irritated and maybe actually angry behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not a reason for you to tolerate it, so you still must insist that<br/>\neach person is safe in your home. But I wonder, do you sympathize with him<br/>\nabout the little child being demanding and irritating and underfoot and so<br/>\non? Or do you try to pretend it ain&#39;t so?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: sibling disrespect","postDate":"1323215710","msgId":64159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpibWEwdSsxMTBlcEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpia2hyYis1aTlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64142,"nextInTopic":64160,"prevInTime":64158,"nextInTime":64160,"topicId":64141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Get involved sooner - spend more time with your kids, in the same room, hanging out, playing and talking and doing things with them.

Get the kids out of the house more often, perhaps - even a trip to a McD&#39;s playland to run off a little steam, or a trip to the store with two of them can help. If he&#39;s playing &quot;too rough&quot; then chances are he needs more ways to be physical. Would he like a punching bag? Some juggling scarves or diablos? I have juggling toys on the mind since Rengade Juggling just updated their website - maybe you can find something fun for your guy(s):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.renegadejuggling.com/\">http://www.renegadejuggling.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBalloons are a good way to have safe, active indoor fun - balloon soccer or volley or even good old balloon stomp can be a good time. <br/>\n<br/>\nA book of party games might be helpful for you.
