The first one slept in my bed from 9 months until just after five years for at least part of the night.  The second one is still there from about 12:30 on.   We have always put them to bed in their own shared king-size bed since they were two-and-a-half and one.  One of us lays with them until they are asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a person who needs a lot of space when I sleep.  Having more than two people in my bed really crowds me.  So there is a lot of bed swapping going on.  Especially since I hate to wake up in their bed (even if they are not in it); so I tried to get them back to sleep in their own bed and return to mine.  Until a couple months ago, my husband traveled M-F so all the bed hopping was up to me.  I was really tired most of the time.  Now, he usually goes into their room to sleep in the big bed.  The elder daughter either sleeps there too or she might be up in the loft bed in their room.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we celibate?  Well, mostly.  We&#39;re boring old farts who really only like to do it in bed.  And we can never seem to get in the mood early enough in the evening to be done before the bed parade starts.  Also, with him traveling so frequently in the past our libidoes rarely seemed in sync and we just got out of the habit.  We&#39;ve tried it a few times in their bed (ick) or the living room floor (tried three separate occasions, got interrupted by a wandering child every time) and once on the fold-out futon (this was our second or third try in the same night and we were so frantic to get finished before yet another little pitter patter that it really wasn&#39;t worth it).  The obvious answer (to my husband) is to lock the bedroom door in The Moment but I refuse due to memories of being locked out of my parents room when I&#39;d had nightmares and crying myself to sleep outside their door.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we get busy about once a month.  I figure that sooner or later, we&#39;ll get our privacy back and/or I&#39;ll get enough sleep and appropriate hormone manipulation that I&#39;ll care enough to find some other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, my husband is not happy with the status quo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19755,"nextTopicId":19814}}
