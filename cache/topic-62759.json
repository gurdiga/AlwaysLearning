That  <br/>\ncan&#39;t be duplicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems counter to what&#39;s said about expanding on their  <br/>\ninterests! But at 2 she&#39;s not interested in meditation really. She&#39;s  <br/>\ninterested in that book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were several special books that my daughter loved when very  <br/>\nyoung and we tried others in the series with the same characters but  <br/>\nwhatever she found special in them wasn&#39;t in the others. (When she was  <br/>\nolder that changed and she did want to explore more with the same  <br/>\ncharacters.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be wrong but it&#39;s something to keep in mind. If you come  <br/>\nacross another meditation book, you could throw it into the mix and  <br/>\nlet her choose if she wants to read it. But I think it&#39;s far more  <br/>\nlikely her interest is in animal characters that spark something in her.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"little kids&#39; books on meditation -- recs?","postDate":"1315121863","msgId":62759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCMDgxMEYyLUQxNkUtNDVBMi1BMzBGLTAwRkQ2QTEyQTEyRkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62760,"prevInTime":62758,"nextInTime":62760,"topicId":62759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 2 year old wants to read Peaceful Piggy Meditation very day sine we got it from the library.
