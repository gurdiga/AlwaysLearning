I am saying this as someone who has spent<br/>\nthe past four years on a gluten/sugar/dairy free diet (due to serious<br/>\nhealth problems), and I have also spent the past year tapering off<br/>\nprescription medication. <br/>\nI think that you can provide food alternatives in the home that can<br/>\nreplace the foods your son is better off avoiding. Example: Replacing<br/>\nmilk with almond milk, wheat flour with brown rice flour, butter with<br/>\ncoconut oil, wheat bread with gluten-free bread, sugar with stevia and<br/>\nxylitol. There&#39;s even a wonderful coconut milk-based &#39;ice cream&#39; that&#39;s<br/>\nsugar-free! There is a way to work around the limitations so that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel like deprivation to him. It might take some extra time, and<br/>\na bit of trial and error on your part. You might even consider giving<br/>\nthese things up yourself if you are going to have him avoid them. I<br/>\nthink many people could avoid serious health issues by avoiding these<br/>\nthree things. As far as medication, I would recommend trying almost<br/>\nanything before resorting to it. Many medications do nothing but mask<br/>\nsymptoms, kill your liver in the process, and leave your body less able<br/>\nto fend off whatever it is it&#39;s trying to fend off.

Due to two medical conditions, Tommy is not supposed to have gluten, dairy or sugar, including all fruit except grapefruit.  He really is supposed to eat mostly meat and vegetables which he does not really want.  Tommy is somewhat interested in smoothies and drink supplements but not so much.  He is also supposed to be asleep early, like 8 pm.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to this point, Tommy has been shopping and eating what he selects plus bits of whatever I cook.  He also goes to sleep around 10:30 to 11 pm. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas how we can gradually move toward the new food and bed guidelines?  I am a bit stumped partly because I am emotional about his health situation.  He is so happy with his program but I have seen that he is paying a price for it.
