My first response was less than gentle, but it was intended with kindness. :-) <div><br></div><div>I was raised in a mostly peaceful and very loving home, where (now, looking back, I see that) some people used food and alcohol compulsively. Someone was always trying to fix someone else, and that mentality persists in that home today. There was also a culture (I see now) of &quot;us&quot; vs them, of &quot;belonging&quot; in the family unit, of approval. We were encouraged to be independent and creative compared to our peers or society, but not disruptive to the family. </div><div><br></div><div>This made for a lovely, safe, happy childhood and it simultaneously created (in me, at least; I can&#39;t speak for my siblings) a struggle to succeed independently in young adulthood and a crippling need for approval from my parents. It was a major contributor to my early marriage and subsequent divorce in my twenties. </div><div><br></div><div>My mom asked me at age 8 if I would like to accompany her to Weight Watchers. I believe her intention was to &quot;teach&quot; me to be healthy and to &quot;be a good role model&quot;. It was presented as my choice. Of course I said yes! My parents made it clear that it was their job to guide me in my decisions, to keep me safe. If they saw something &quot;wrong&quot; with me, I intended to fix it, because I trusted that if it was important to them, it must be important. Most exciting events in my preteen years forward were preceded by a daydream of what size I would be when the event took place and full of calculations counting down the days and weeks divided by the number of pounds I needed to lose in order to be the &quot;real&quot; me by that time. And if I didn&#39;t achieve that &quot;goal&quot;, then I was a failure and the event didn&#39;t meet my high expectations. </div><div><br></div><div>My niece just turned 6 and weighs about 75 lbs. She has been off the charts in height, weight, and head circumference since birth. Her parents are both petite, but her maternal grandmother and great aunts are over 6ft tall and her great uncle is about 6&#39;6&quot;. She had a serious dairy/soy allergy until age 2, often woke every 45mins until she 3, vomits when emotionally upset, and has had a few seizures. Her parents are both schoolteachers by trade and constantly monitor in order to (IMO) diagnose her, create an action plan, and develop customized coping mechanisms. They swaddled her until she was 15mos old because they were so terrified of having a &quot;bad night&quot;. Then they wondered why she didn&#39;t walk until 21mos. They asked doctors at every appointment until she was 5, if they should be worried about her weight. The doctor said, &quot;not yet, not yet, not yet.&quot; Then, magically, at 5, it became an issue to keep tabs on, and they began trying to control the compulsive eating habit that they created! At family gatherings, she has at least 2 parents and 2 grandparents monitoring what she eats and reporting back to each other on what and how much she has had and whether she should be stopped from eating more. This is a girl who loves to run, jump on her trampoline, dance and socialize. She doesn&#39;t care nearly as much about what she&#39;s eating as to be included in the social act of eating because she recognizes that people connect with each other when they eat. It breaks my heart to watch anyone think they need to teach her anything about being a human - if they would only step back and *look at her*, there is so much *they* could learn *from her*. </div><div><br></div><div>Until recently, I was heavily involved in my family&#39;s business. I fought with my dad constantly, wondering why he didn&#39;t understand my perspective. And finally, I realized - he was reacting defensively, because every time I made a mistake (or succeeded in something he didn&#39;t agree with) he took it personally. He was so upset with himself for all those things he&#39;d been trying to fix about me for years and had failed. I cannot impart upon you how damaging this was to our relationship, how it inhibited my ability to grow professionally. I was not his project to fix - not when I was 8, or 18, or 36. My learning was my own business. </div><div><br></div><div>Deschooling is so much more than moving away from curriculum or grades or tests. It is about recognizing that you have a choice in every moment, and that you learn something *no matter which choice you make*. Unschooling works by removing the idea that learning happens in one choice but not the other, that learning can be caused by teaching. Becoming an expert *on one&#39;s self* and finding the power in healing one&#39;s self is the key to moving out of the way of another person&#39;s learning. </div><div><br></div><div>~Tara</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1634143678gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1634143678gmail_quote\">On Wed, Sep 10, 2014 at 12:21 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

It was wrong of us to let our fears\n about medical intervention be our focus and to let that lead us back in the wrong direction. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">His weight is very much a symptom of our anxiety. &nbsp;Our focus needs to be on shedding the anxiety and moving in a better direction again. &nbsp;We will find tai chi videos on youtube and I do not doubt that Alexander will want to join us. &nbsp;That sounds like a lot of fun. &nbsp;Mindfulness speaks very strongly to Alexander and he enthusiastically employs calm deep breathing and being fully in the present moment to help him with all sorts of daily situations like crossing the road, getting to sleep and going to the toilet. &nbsp;It really works for him.</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">We aren&#39;t as much of a mess as this tangle makes us sound. &nbsp;Or maybe we are, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.\n Food is where we fall down. &nbsp;It&#39;s where we put our anxiety and stress. &nbsp;You are quite right to point out that we have not moved past our fears. &nbsp;We had come a long way but this has put us right back where we were a year ago. &nbsp;The change wasn&#39;t deep enough. &nbsp;If it had been true and solid and rooted in us we wouldn&#39;t have sprung back into this pit of food stress so quickly. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">Now that his chest is not tight all the time he is becoming more active again and his fitness levels are increasing. &nbsp;We have always loved active games. &nbsp;Racing, chasing, swimming and play fighting. &nbsp;Huge nurf gun fights!. &nbsp;His trampoline and space hopper are very popular and we love to sing and dance together. &nbsp;Even gaming isn&#39;t sedentary. &nbsp;Nothing like trolling each other in minecraft or disney infinity and laughing hysterically to\n raise our heart rates and leave us proper breathless! &nbsp;Being active and big strong vigorous movement is an area of joy, not anxiety. &nbsp;The drop in his activity levels was quite gradual and with hindsight it makes more sense in the light of slowly building asthma symptoms. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">I am going to keep losing weight and managing asthma off his radar. &nbsp;We need to go back to saying yes and offering lots of good things. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">No, he does not always overeat. &nbsp;And the stomach pain may well have been because of allergy rather than overeating. I was being unfair. That&#39;s fear and muddy thinking talking. &nbsp;He overeats when he senses stress and anxiety from us. &nbsp;He overeats when I offer him food because I am feeling anxious, when I confuse love and sugar, and\n always when there is disapproval and attempts to control and limit food. &nbsp;Also when he is bored or understimulated. &nbsp;None of that is good and none of it is helped by trying to fix him. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\">His issues with texture and strong flavours is real, as are his sensory cravings, but I suspect even that will improve as the anxiety ebbs. &nbsp;Hard to be adventurous with food when it feels so stressful to us all. &nbsp;I will stick to offering smaller portions but not tense up when he wants more. &nbsp;I think smaller portions are good because that supports him in eating mindfully. &nbsp;I think offering ice and chew stix and low calory bulky grazing foods are good. &nbsp;</div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1811838268\" clear=\"none\"></div><div style=\"\"

us\n              feel calmer.  </p>\n            <div><br>\n            </div>\n            <div>Alexander was 26kg the last time he was weighed in\n              hospital.  On his first admission a few weeks earlier he\n              was more than 2kg lighter so yeah the steroids have had an\n              effect.  He is a little taller than average for his age\n              but he is still obese on their charts.  </div>\n            <div><br>\n            </div>\n            <div>There is one particular doctor, who I will be trying to\n              avoid seeing ever again, who lectured me for a long time\n              about his weight.  Wanted me to get a scale and weigh him\n              regularly, insisted that his recent weight gain was not\n              because of steroids and tried to tell me that activity\n              levels have nothing to do with weight.  She was not\n              helpful and it has ramped up my stress levels quite a lot\n              to have that medical voice in my head.  Your calm words\n              are helping me turn away from that.  </div>\n            <div><br>\n            </div>\n            <div>Dust is the biggest trigger, &#39;though food allergies,\n              pollen and pet dander are probably playing a part.\n               Putting an encasement on the mattress made a dramatic\n              difference overnight.  And the preventer meds seem to be\n              working now.  We are getting the help we need to unpick\n              Alexander&#39;s triggers and understand how his asthma effects\n              him.  I don&#39;t think his weight is the biggest exacerbating\n              factor and I also think fitness if far more important than\n              weight to health generally and asthma particularly, but\n              there is a great deal of hysteria in the medical\n              profession about overweight and obesity and we are going\n              to keep hearing about his weight. It was wrong of us to\n              let our fears about medical intervention be our focus and\n              to let that lead us back in the wrong direction.  </div>\n            <div><br>\n            </div>\n            <div>His weight is very much a symptom of our anxiety.  Our\n              focus needs to be on shedding the anxiety and moving in a\n              better direction again.  We will find tai chi videos on\n              youtube and I do not doubt that Alexander will want to\n              join us.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Mindfulness\n              speaks very strongly to Alexander and he enthusiastically\n              employs calm deep breathing and being fully in the present\n              moment to help him with all sorts of daily situations like\n              crossing the road, getting to sleep and going to the\n              toilet.  It really works for him.</div>\n            <div><br>\n            </div>\n            <div>We aren&#39;t as much of a mess as this tangle makes us\n              sound.  Or maybe we are, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that\n              way.

My youngest (now 7) was hospitalized twice (once right before she turned two and again a few months afterwards).

My oldest tried two different daily medications before finding one that worked well enough to control her asthma (to her doctors, &quot;control&quot; means using her rescue inhaler less than once a week). <br><br>It wasn&#39;t until she saw an allergist that I even knew there were different kinds of daily medication. As soon as she switched to the one that worked for her, her asthma was immediately better. But the medication that didn&#39;t work for oldest works fine for my youngest.<br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra\">There are different things that can trigger asthma issues. When my kids&#39; dad lived with us, he had to leave the house before I could vacuum. My kids&#39; asthma can be triggered by pollen, weather changes, seasons, pets, and colds.<br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra\">Finding a way to help your son manage his asthma (and at this age, it is really you managing it, not him) in a peaceful, relaxed way is really important. My kids use a spacer, which I&#39;m told is very important. Some models just have a mouthpiece, but theirs covers their nose and mouth, which helps ensure the medicine is getting into their lungs. I also have them take five deeps breaths every time they use it.

Less active more weight gain but I don;t think more weight gain more asthma.&nbsp; <br clear=\"none\">The relationship between being active and less asthma is that people who have a better cardiovascular system and a more develop lungs can oxygenate their blood better.

It is how active you are, the allergies around , the weather, stress, getting a bad cold,\n even what kind of heat you have in the house! What triggers asthma is different from person to person!&nbsp; Even a cleaner can trigger your asthma! <br>The other day I was in a County Fair public restroom and a cleaning lady walked in and sprayed the sink next to me with a very strong cleaner. Instantly I felt it burn and I knew it could trigger my asthma. IT did.<br>The difference between me and a 4 year old is that I may be more aware of what will trigger my asthma and avoid or be more prepared. <br>Weight has never had ANY influence in how my asthma is.&nbsp; Now being more active , even if 30 pounds heavier) does help me a lot.&nbsp; <br><br>More bike rides, more walks, more time on a playground, more swimming, more jumping on a trampoline, more playing ball or tag...<br>I would do more that !

Relax, Make sure lots of healthy things are available and being offered! Instead of&nbsp; telling him just one banana get him busy! Play with him. Say: Lets play hide and seek! lets go to the pool.\n The more he feels he cannot eat more ( and he probably may still be hungry) the more he will focus on food.&nbsp; give him some carrots if he is still hungry!<br><br>So offer MORE food ( low calorie and fiber) not less. Make lots of yummy foods that fill up and are not super high calories. <br>Make sure he is getting some protein and fat ( not just sugar /carbohydrates ) to balance his blood sugar and hunger.<br>When I was a little girl ( and not overweight ) I was hungry&nbsp; and ate A LOT!.<br>Feeling guilty about eating one more banana and focusing on weight would have me thinking of food 24 hours a day and feeling guilty most of those hours.

Less active more weight gain but I don;t think more weight gain more asthma.&nbsp; <br>The relationship between being active and less asthma is that people who have a better cardiovascular system and a more develop lungs can oxygenate their blood better. So even if you still have asthma your body is able to use and get more oxygen. I hope I am explaining that right!<br><br>That is why kids with asthma were told to do swimming!<br><br><br></span></div><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-579118495\"><span style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-579118495\"><br style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-579118495\" clear=\"none\"></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-579118495\"><span style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-579118495\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He\n often struggles to manage and cope with sensory stimulation levels, \nwhich is not generally a problem because we can adjust things to meet \nhis needs but he seeks oral stimulation a lot.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Gums? xylitol gums( good for teeth and low calorie and still sweet)?<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp; He is also rather \nemotionally sensitive and eats to buffer transitions and to manage \nanxiety. &nbsp;I offer cups of ice chips, sensory chews and frozen teething \nrings preemptively to try to satisfy his need for icy things and things \nto chew. &nbsp;Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;He can&#39;t, for \ninstance, &nbsp;cope with getting on a train without eating. &nbsp;I carry a \nbanana and nobody makes a big deal of it.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Frozen bananas would be great!

You&#39;re asking -- even if not directly -- for ways to fix him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s coming through in your writing is stress. If you&#39;re stressed, your child will be stressed. Stress is a factor in asthma. Stress can cause eating. Not just because food is soothing but because stress cranks up the body&#39;s craving for calories. I once spent a very stressful day getting into Boston traffic court to fight a speeding ticket. Normally I can eat 2 pieces of a large pizza and regret a 3rd ;-) That night I ate 4 and wasn&#39;t stuffed! Your body craves fuel when it&#39;s stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible -- and I&#39;m guessing at this from various clues -- that the body isn&#39;t just craving calories to burn but to store. It&#39;s gearing the body up for whatever big event that has the body so worked up with stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing on his weight will cause more stress. It will feel like he&#39;s the cause of your stress when he isn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nBreathing. Meditation. Yoga. Tai Chi. If you can find programs (on DVD) that are fun for kids, invite him along. Don&#39;t make him. Just approach the practices with joy and invite him to join you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say focus on getting the bulk of your meals and snacks more healthy. Don&#39;t bring sweets into the house unless he asks specifically. And you can make sweet things with him like whole grain banana muffins, fruit smoothies. Having some fat in with the sweet will slow the digestion down so he won&#39;t feel hungry so quickly. Explore with him to find foods he will find satisfying. If you have the ability to grow even a container garden, kids are often drawn to food they can pick and eat that they wouldn&#39;t normally eat from the store.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The steady build up of asthma and allergy symptoms (tomatoes and dust as well as egg) have made him less and less active.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What kind of active things are you and your wife doing with him?<br/>\n<br/>\nWalks in the woods. Climbing over rocks. Playing ball on the beach. Most parents can take their kid to the park and let him go! :-) Right now while he&#39;s finding it difficult to be active, doing more active things *with* you will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nA dog might help. As long as you get some good advice on one that has the right personality for your child :-) Dogs can help with stress. They can help with exercise. As long as you can find ways *not* to stress over walking and other care. Make it a joyful time to be together. The more you make it a pleasant time, the less he&#39;ll say no.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re saying about the banana and wait 10 minutes and chewing on ice sound like good ideas. Steering kids towards other options is good as long as they still do have their original choice available. Just like anyone, kids can get stuck on one thing that&#39;s partially soothing. So it&#39;s hard to not reach for that soothing thing when you&#39;re stressed. Helping him to explore other options that might work better while not forbidding what he finds soothing is useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":553469744,"authorName":"","from":"fishbeensnail@...","profile":"fishbeeandsnail","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unpicking weight loss.","postDate":"1410341359","msgId":74790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGx1cDVsZisxNm41MzVoQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGx1cDR1MCsxbDJvZGZhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG8wdHV0NTNkMXZhcTdsMmtqNXB5OWFydS4xNDEwMzE4ODU2MTYxQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPgk8bHVwNHUwKzFsMm9kZmFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74789,"nextInTopic":74791,"prevInTime":74789,"nextInTime":74791,"topicId":74782,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry, I replied too quickly and that must have sounded ungrateful and defensive.
