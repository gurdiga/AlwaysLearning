Certainly not me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I figured out years ago that the human species is totally fucked and has been<br/>\n&gt; for a long time. I also know that the sick, media-consumer culture in America<br/>\n&gt; continues to make this so-called problem worse. But the trick, folks, is not<br/>\n&gt; to give a fuck. Like me. I really don&#39;t care. I stopped worrying about all<br/>\n&gt; this temporal bullshit a long time ago. It&#39;s meaningless. (See the preface of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Braindroppings.&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another problem I have with &quot;Paradox&quot; is that the ideas are all expressed in a<br/>\n&gt; sort of pseudo-spiritual, New-Age-y, &quot;Gee-whiz-can&#39;t-we-do-better-than-this&quot;<br/>\n&gt; tone of voice.

The essay has<br/>\nsince been attributed to comedian George Carlin, an unnamed Columbine High<br/>\nSchool student, and that most prolific of scribes, Anonymous.<br/>\nGeorge Carlin very emphatically denied he had had anything to do with<br/>\n&quot;Paradox,&quot; a piece he referred to as &quot;a sappy load of shit,&quot; and posted his<br/>\ncomments about being associated with this essay on his own web site.<br/>\nThe true author of the piece is neither George Carlin nor Jeff Dickson, nor<br/>\nis he anonymous. Credit belongs with Dr. Bob Moorehead, former pastor of<br/>\nSeattle&#39;s Overlake Christian Church. (He retired in 1998 after 29 years in<br/>\nthat post). The essay appeared under the title &quot;The Paradox of Our Age&quot; in<br/>\nWords Aptly Spoken, Dr. Moorehead&#39;s 1995 collection of prayers, homilies,<br/>\nand monologues used in his sermons and radio broadcasts:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Paradox of Our Age<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have taller buildings but shorter tempers; wider freeways but narrower<br/>\n&gt; viewpoints; we spend more but have less; we buy more but enjoy it less; we<br/>\n&gt; have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences, yet less time; we<br/>\n&gt; have more degrees but less sense; more knowledge but less judgement; more<br/>\n&gt; experts, yet more problems; we have more gadgets but less satisfaction; more<br/>\n&gt; medicine, yet less wellness; we take more vitamins but see fewer results. We<br/>\n&gt; drink too much; smoke too much; spend too recklessly; laugh too little; drive<br/>\n&gt; too fast; get too angry quickly; stay up too late; get up too tired; read too<br/>\n&gt; seldom; watch TV too much and pray too seldom.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values; we fly in faster<br/>\n&gt; planes to arrive there quicker, to do less and return sooner; we sign more<br/>\n&gt; contracts only to realize fewer profits; we talk too much; love too seldom and<br/>\n&gt; lie too often. We&#39;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life; we&#39;ve added<br/>\n&gt; years to life, not life to years. We&#39;ve been all the way to the moon and back,<br/>\n&gt; but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. We&#39;ve conquered<br/>\n&gt; outer space, but not inner space; we&#39;ve done larger things, but not better<br/>\n&gt; things; we&#39;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul; we&#39;ve split the atom,<br/>\n&gt; but not our prejudice; we write more, but learn less; plan more, but<br/>\n&gt; accomplish less; we make faster planes, but longer lines; we learned to rush,<br/>\n&gt; but not to wait; we have more weapons, but less peace; higher incomes, but<br/>\n&gt; lower morals; more parties, but less fun; more food, but less appeasement;<br/>\n&gt; more acquaintances, but fewer friends; more effort, but less success. We build<br/>\n&gt; more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but<br/>\n&gt; have less communication; drive smaller cars that have bigger problems; build<br/>\n&gt; larger factories that produce less. We&#39;ve become long on quantity, but short<br/>\n&gt; on quality. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; tall men, but short<br/>\n&gt; character; steep in profits, but shallow relationships. These are times of<br/>\n&gt; world peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure and less fun; higher postage,<br/>\n&gt; but slower mail; more kinds of food, but less nutrition. These are days of two<br/>\n&gt; incomes, but more divorces; these are times of fancier houses, but broken<br/>\n&gt; homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, cartridge living,<br/>\n&gt; thow-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies and pills that do<br/>\n&gt; everything from cheer, to prevent, quiet or kill. It is a time when there is<br/>\n&gt; much in the show window and nothing in the stock room. Indeed, these are the<br/>\n&gt; times! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those intent upon taking inspiration from &quot;Paradox&quot; should consider the<br/>\nfollowing: during Bob Moorehead&#39;s tenure as pastor of Overlake Christian<br/>\nChurch, seventeen members of his congregation reported that he had sexually<br/>\nassaulted them. These allegations, which surfaced in 1997, prompted his<br/>\nresignation in 1998. After a year of publicly supporting Moorehead the<br/>\nchurch elders withdrew their support, their own investigation into the<br/>\ncharges having led them to conclude their pastor had indeed been guilty of<br/>\nmolesting a number of male churchgoers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts true authorship aside, the piece picked up its attribution to an unnamed<br/>\nstudent who witnessed the killings at Littleton in the aftermath of 20 April<br/>\n1999, while America was still struggling to make sense of that day&#39;s<br/>\nhorrific events. The killings at Columbine shook us deeply, leaving behind a<br/>\nnation of survivors looking for the one set of answers which could begin to<br/>\nexplain the horrifically inexplicable. Having this essay flow from the pen<br/>\nof an unnamed student who bore witness to this unspeakable act of violence<br/>\nmade sense Â surely such a teen would have valuable words of wisdom or<br/>\ncautions we all should heed. The oft-repeated header &quot;A Columbine High<br/>\nSchool student wrote&quot; infused the essay with the significance and meaning<br/>\nfolks thirsted for. (This belief that witnessing a tragedy or losing a loved<br/>\none imbues a person with special insight into the causes and cures of<br/>\nsociety&#39;s ills also fuels the Internet version of the testimony given before<br/>\nthe House judiciary committee by Darrell Scott, father of Rachel Scott, one<br/>\nof the teens murdered at Columbine High School.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt right that this essay emerge from the horror that was the Columbine<br/>\nmassacre. Certainly someone somewhere had to be able to make sense of all<br/>\nthis. Certainly some good, some protection against future acts of random<br/>\ninsanity, had to come out of all this grief and loss, else what had it all<br/>\nbeen for? Yet that was not the case. The essay which has come to be called<br/>\n&quot;The Paradox of Our Time&quot; was written at least four years before the<br/>\nkillings in Littleton, Colorado. There was no association between the essay<br/>\nand the shootings, though many felt at least momentarily comforted by the<br/>\nnotion that there had been.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like pieces such as &quot;The Paradox of Our Time&quot; because they summarize all<br/>\nthe problems of modern society into a neat laundry list of &quot;What Has Gone<br/>\nWrong&quot; while presenting possible solutions by way of juxtaposition. The<br/>\npairing of &quot;We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values,&quot; for<br/>\nexample, implies that increased affluence is responsible for a decline in<br/>\nmorality and carries the underlying implication that if we turn our backs on<br/>\nthe almighty dollar, our kids will no longer murder one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nClear-cut cause-and-effect pairings provide far more comfort than does<br/>\naccepting the harsh reality that we live in a world of no assurances at all,<br/>\na world where bad things can happen at any moment, to anyone, for no<br/>\ndiscernable (and thus no preventable) reason. Our ancestors coped with that<br/>\nfeeling of powerlessness by inventing myths about petty, lust-filled,<br/>\nvengeful gods who, even if they were capricious in their actions and<br/>\ninsensible to the human misery their warring caused, were at least tangible<br/>\nentities who could be identified as the cause of otherwise unfathomable<br/>\ncatastrophes. Our sophistication has loosed us from our belief in those<br/>\nmyths, leaving us vulnerable to a sense of a world careening out of control.<br/>\nBarbara &quot;chaos theory&quot; Mikkelson<br/>\nLast updated: Â  30 May 2003<br/>\n===========================<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157848909,"authorName":"Louise Robbins","from":"&quot;Louise Robbins&quot; &lt;loueliandguy@...&gt;","profile":"soulribbons","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Just had to share this with you all  - something for the heart and mind!","postDate":"1075319950","msgId":18551,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ2OTRhZStnaXN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18554,"prevInTime":18550,"nextInTime":18552,"topicId":18551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Isn t it amazing that George Carlin - mouthy comedian of the 70 s, 80 s and 90 s - could write something so very eloquent ... and so very appropriate post","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1029062299\">Isn&#39;t it amazing that George Carlin - mouthy comedian of the 70&#39;s, <br/>\n80&#39;s and 90&#39;s - could write something so very eloquent ... and so <br/>\nvery appropriate post 9-11.
