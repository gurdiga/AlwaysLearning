If he likes lots of very intense touch, look for ways to touch him - offer him a massage, scratch his back, things like that. Offer to do it before he asks.

But if he gets 3 glasses and can have as many as he wants, he  <br/>\nwon&#39;t seem thirsty at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can&#39;t need less by being given less. He can&#39;t modify his needs to  <br/>\nmeet what you&#39;re willing to give. He can lose faith that you&#39;ll meet  <br/>\nhis needs. He can look elsewhere to others offering to give what you  <br/>\nwon&#39;t. (It&#39;s how predators work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can mentally shift away from seeing his demands as too much to  <br/>\nhis needs being large and you as the one who is privileged with  <br/>\nmeeting them, it will help a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will also help to shift away from stuffing down your own needs to  <br/>\nmeet his. Shift to finding ways to meet his needs AND yours.

If you intend to withhold the opportunity for him to learn on his own (not &quot;teach himself,&quot; but to grow into it in his own way in his own time, while he&#39;s learning a thousand other things too), then these ideas and this advice might not work for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-i had very little support in the freedom i allowed him-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean you&#39;re living with relatives or other  housemates?  Or maybe you&#39;ve had pressure from parents?  I&#39;m only guessing because you dropped an unclear hint.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":494722316,"authorName":"Radha ma Tayay","from":"&quot;Radha ma Tayay&quot; &lt;blissfulcalm@...&gt;","profile":"lilmasters@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"boundaries, reading, etc.","postDate":"1318569298","msgId":63388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3OGdnaStob2VzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63389,"prevInTime":63387,"nextInTime":63389,"topicId":63388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello I am new here.

He went to school one semester before i pulled him out then put him in another one semester pulled him out again.  He is almost eight now and I never established boundaries when he was very young and so now he argues with me on everything.  I have studied a lot of waldorf philosophy regarding the six seven year change which i found really helpful.  he is past that now and he is very ... to say it positive... persistent.  to say it negatively he harrasses me and i often have to separate myself from him because he won&#39;t take no for an answer 99 percent of the time.  He needs a lot of physical stimulation which is very draining.  He is constantly putting things in my face no matter how much i tell him not to OR climbing on my back/ shoulders any chance he gets.  We are an only parent/ only child dynamic which intesifies things...  <br/>\n<br/>\nhe is totally resistant to anything to do with school.  he loves harry potter: listening, reading, watching, riding bike/ scooter, watching animal documentaries, stories...  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want advice regarding how your children learned to read.  I know many children teach themselves but don&#39;t see that happening with my son...  i no longer consider myself a pure unschooler, not since my son was 5...  i had very little support in the freedom i allowed him... and did not have a partner in protection of such... and now he is older and very controlling of me and so I do have to have boundaries with him now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63390,"nextTopicId":63304}}
