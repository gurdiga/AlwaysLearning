A trick of sorts to<br/>\nlook behind the initial representation of something. A way to get creative<br/>\nenergies moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept is that numbers are not always whole, complete, never changing<br/>\nitems.  The easiest way I look at it is with lumps of clay.  If you have two<br/>\nlumps of clay and put of them together with two more lumps of clay, what<br/>\nhave you got? It could be four lumps of clay.  Or maybe the first two were<br/>\nput together in one lump and now you have three.  Or now maybe all were put<br/>\ntogether and all you have is one.  Or maybe you have a whole set of cups and<br/>\nsaucers.  Or one grand pot. Or an electrical insulator.  Another example<br/>\nthat I heard recently on this list (when I used the same phrase) would be if<br/>\nyou dealing with armies. Would you have one a big army? An alliance? Many<br/>\nmany many platoons? A lot of arguing and tired feet?  If you have two<br/>\narguments and add two more arguments is it a discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if one of the twos was negative?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exercise goes on.  Conceptually what is a number?  A name? A thing?  A<br/>\nmodel? How do &quot;things&quot; change? Things you put a name to.  How does that<br/>\nnamed thing change when things around it change? Is a named thing constant<br/>\nbecause it has a name? And on and on and on...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a rare Education major that even wanted to have this discussion in my<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98536371,"authorName":"Kinkade","from":"&quot;Kinkade&quot; &lt;kinkade@...&gt;","profile":"hsmomof4kiddies","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 352","postDate":"1021041633","msgId":6838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTgwMWMxZjgzMCRhNDRiNDcwMCRiMDhlYThjMEB3aW45ODAxPg==","referencesHeader":"PDViLjI3OTQ5YjVlLjJhMGM2MjU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6824,"nextInTopic":6845,"prevInTime":6837,"nextInTime":6839,"topicId":6818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2029004930\">&lt;&lt;I couldn&#39;t see turning over my child to someone who didn&#39;t know the difference between the Greek and Roman cultures or why we<br/>\nwent to the moon or that 2 + 2 doesn&#39;t always equal four or even how to utilize the classroom experience&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, this I can follow.
