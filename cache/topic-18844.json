Lisa likes SIMS, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got a copy of Kid Pix 3.  I bought it on ebay packaged together with Print Shop, both for under $8 including shipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI installed kid pix yesterday and had a blast playing with it myself.  Lisa played for about 5 minutes and Jackie hasn&#39;t even peeked at it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did buy it with Jackie in mind, as she does a lot of drawing.

There <br/>\nare many different versions out there, you can try scholastic&#39;s <br/>\nwebsite for some or your local computer stores too!<br/>\n <br/>\nThese games teach real life skills like how to design and build and <br/>\nrun your own park, real estate or space homes. Everything from <br/>\npurchasing land to budgeting to handling satisfied and unsatisfied <br/>\ncustomers, keeping the parks cleaning and staying in the black <br/>\ninstead of in the red in your own business and much more are <br/>\nall &quot;real life skills&quot; that she can learn while at the same time <br/>\nhave fun too! :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are so much fun to play and she is learning too! :) And they <br/>\nare a great adventure which I know you said she likes! :)<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps! :)<br/>\nGood Luck and let me know if she likes them if you try them! :)<br/>\nPatti (and sons Chris 12, Matthew 7, and Anthony 6)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18818,"nextTopicId":18850}}
