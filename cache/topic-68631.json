My first thought was, geesh, what else *would* we be doing with them? I had never stopped to consider that unschooling is a product of/reaction to the culture that we all live in, that the time will come when unschooling is irrelevant because the whole concept of education is different. Who knows what people will be doing with their kids in 100 or 200 or 1,000 years? It was very helpful for me to see that unschooling was the *method* that some folks are currently using to allow natural ways of learning emerge in this present cultural moment that happens to privilege compulsory education. It was also fun to think about ways some people have probably always tried to work around or away from whatever system or custom or laws happen to be in place at the time in order to learn what they want in the ways that are best for them.</span><br style=\"line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">But! Also, I thought, wow, what a perfect expression of humanity in this day and age unschooling is! We can get our hands on so much information, we can get to so many places, we can access so many people because of this very cool moment in history of the Internet, fairly easy transportation, and enough leisure time (versus time spent focused on surviving) to explore ideas and try skills and make friends and connections.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"line-height:15px;font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">People have a lot of resources these days, and they are mostly very accessible; of course it makes sense that some of them would seek to use what&#39;s available to them when they want it, not just what the schools offer between 8 and 3.

My first thought was, geesh, what else *would* we be doing with them? I had never stopped to consider that unschooling is a product of/reaction to the culture that we all live in, that the time will come when unschooling is irrelevant because the whole concept of education is different. Who knows what people will be doing with their kids in 100 or 200 or 1,000 years? It was very helpful for me to see that unschooling was the *method* that some folks are currently using to allow natural ways of learning emerge in this present cultural moment that happens to privilege compulsory education. It was also fun to think about ways some people have probably always tried to work around or away from whatever system or custom or laws happen to be in place at the time in order to learn what they want in the ways that are best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut! Also, I thought, wow, what a perfect expression of humanity in this day and age unschooling is! We can get our hands on so much information, we can get to so many places, we can access so many people because of this very cool moment in history of the Internet, fairly easy transportation, and enough leisure time (versus time spent focused on surviving) to explore ideas and try skills and make friends and connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have a lot of resources these days, and they are mostly very accessible; of course it makes sense that some of them would seek to use what&#39;s available to them when they want it, not just what the schools offer between 8 and 3. It possibly has never been easier to learn about as many different things from so many different sources as it is right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m with you that what seems to those of us coming from a different paradigm as &quot;miraculous&quot; may well be the most logical outcome of trying to make the most of living in the here and now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nmama to Woody (6 1/2) and Fox (3 1/2)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Illiteracy","postDate":"1345300143","msgId":68659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswbzhyZithZmRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZDOTJCQzM3LTg2ODEtNEJGNi1CRjNDLTRFNENFRUQzRjBENkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68658,"nextInTopic":68660,"prevInTime":68658,"nextInTime":68660,"topicId":68631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That happened very recently, although I think the fears stopped a while ago. On the contrary, I am very confident about it all at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely from watching my children learn everything. Our homeschooling experience started with pulling my oldest out of school when he was halfway through 7th grade, 12 years old. He could already read and had done lots of math and other academics in school so we didn&#39;t have the experience of watching him learn that stuff on his own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other children have always been unschooled so everything they&#39;ve learned can be accredited to them. With respect to reading, we&#39;ve never done lessons or forced reading and my 2nd child was reading books to his little brother when he was 7. My 3rd child could recognize everyone&#39;s names on Christmas presents when he was 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other day my 8 year old did this math problem. He told me that jets can fly 30 miles in a half a second (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s correct but it&#39;s irrelevant to this example.). He asked me how much 60 + 60 was. I told him 120. Then he told me it would take a jet 2 seconds to go that far. There was no hesitation, no struggle, no having to get out paper and pencil and write out the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about academics because that&#39;s what most people seem to get hung up on. Of course, they do all kinds of other things, painting, drawing, sewing, making up stories that they act out, catching tadpoles in the ditch next to our house after a big rain, riding bikes and skateboards, playing with friends in the neighborhood, meeting the bearded dragons and tarantula pets of our new friends. I could probably go on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell people that I&#39;m amazed every day by what my kids know and learn. It seems miraculous. It&#39;s not, really. It&#39;s normal.

Like, there&#39;s an idea that reading is about reading books for pleasure and a &quot;good reader&quot; is someone who enjoys reading. It&#39;s not true! Reading is a useful set of skills, like (in the US) driving a car. I drive almost every day, but I don&#39;t really enjoy it - unlike my brother, who is into amateur racing. My daughter doesn&#39;t really read for pleasure, even though she&#39;s been able to read since she was 4 - it&#39;s a useful skill for her, but she&#39;d much rather look at images than read words. She&#39;s a big fan of shows and movies and graphic novels. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s another one of the common messages about reading, that it&#39;s superior to watching, and that print books are superior to graphic works. It surprised me the first time I tried to read a graphic novel with my daughter - it was harder than I expected! I had to learn a whole different way to take in a story, and at first I missed a lot because I&#39;d read the words and not spend enough time looking at the pictures (and then I got my first manga experience... I still have to check the &quot;how to read this book&quot; diagrams now and then to read those).<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Illiteracy","postDate":"1345249717","msgId":68656,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOThGNjk2LUE2QzMtNDc3MS1CMDBGLTY2MkNCRDI1RkUzRkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxODNBOUVBLTFFNjItNDIxMC05RTFCLUQ4QzQyOTVBM0I2NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGswbWZsbytwZ2lwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjE4M0E5RUEtMUU2Mi00MjEwLTlFMUItRDhDNDI5NUEzQjY0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68655,"nextInTopic":68657,"prevInTime":68655,"nextInTime":68657,"topicId":68631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My middle daughter is a bright, active child, and my younger boy is just a joy. We have a close relationship that involves lots of me reading to them (they bring me books all the time to read). My eldest daughter is a voracious reader and has been reading all sorts of books from a young age. The other two were labelled as slow readers at school, placed in remedial programs and generally made to feel inferior (not just by teachers but by other children who ridiculed them for not being able to read what they were reading or not being on the same reading level as everyone else). Now they often say to me &quot;I can&#39;t read&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll never be able to read those books, they are too hard&quot;.

She seems to have this misconception that unschooling means leaving kids to do things all on their own even though I&#39;ve told her many times that it&#39;s not like that at all. She says, &quot;I know you do a lot with your kids, but...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve asked me if I read to my kids. I have and do.

I mean, if you do it (unschool), you will see that it works but some people are afraid. I guess that&#39;s normal when first learning about unschooling. It took several years before I stopped having those fears creep into my thoughts every once in a while. I can finally say that after about 9 years of reading about, thinking about and doing unschooling those fears don&#39;t enter my mind anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Illiteracy","postDate":"1345228330","msgId":68643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5OEE2MDczLTU1MDgtNDcyNi1BMDFFLUU3Q0NBQTVGOTlGOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDUyMjc4MjcuMzM5MzUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGswbG5ubytvM29yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RThGODlGRUMtQThGNi00MDc4LUI5MDktRDRBOEQ3MjlGM0IwQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8MTM0NTIyNzgyNy4zMzkzNS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDUubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68641,"nextInTopic":68644,"prevInTime":68642,"nextInTime":68644,"topicId":68631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- It was not without anything but it was not with instruction.

He would happily sit and listen to another person reading, and he often sensed information that was in texts (using pictures and other clues), but if you sat down with him to do reading instruction, he would become dejected, distracted, sometimes angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing was, he was a confident, interested, engaged kid. His brain was busy all the time with all kinds of ideas and wonderings. He used other means to get the information he needed--he made friends with the park rangers to learn about local flora, fauna, and geology--favorite topics. He watched a lot of YouTube, listened to a lot of music, easily picked the brains of parents, teachers, other perceived &quot;experts.&quot; He was actually a lot more skilled than most at getting information from other sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what his earlier years were like, and I do know that he wasn&#39;t OK with not being a reader (no wonder, with so much pressure and focus on his lack). But I can tell you that he was so busy learning in all the other ways he was good at that it seemed like he hardly had time to put in doing something that was so difficult for him. There was probably some avoidance there, but there was also a pretty sensible--in the big picture--method of focusing and playing up on his easiest and favorite forms of gaining access to the information he wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Aug 17, 2012, at 11:24 AM, keetry wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One friend asked, if people can learn to read without instruction, how does illiteracy happen? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Without instruction&quot; doesn&#39;t mean learning to read without anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are factors that must be present in order to read.

But it was everywhere, and there were phrases and words that were part of everyone&#39;s everyday life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking Spanish at school was forbidden, among the children (in the 1960&#39;s; bilingual ed came along in the early 1970&#39;s).

People lived in little mountain towns and farmed, and had long, long been cut off from any outside influences.

People would ask me how that was possible, and I would joke that she was a stubborn woman.  I was only half joking, and that only told a small piece of her story.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was French Canadian.  She grew up in rural Quebec, one of 13 children.  She had 7 of her own.  I am sure that during the first half of her life, survival was more important than reading.  But, not reading became part of her identity - a part she and her family held on to, tightly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember as a young girl visiting her.  She always lived with one of her children, and there was always a large group of people in any of the homes she lived.  We could often be found sitting in the kitchen in chairs in a big circle talking.  Most of the people spoke french.  One of my aunts would translate for my mom and I.  (Talk about stubborn...my mom lived most of her life in Montreal, and never learned to speak french...but that&#39;s another story.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn one visit I was particularly excited because I had learned a few french words in school (I grew up in Ontario), and I had learned the french alphabet.  I sat on my grandma&#39;s lap, eager to share my surprise, and proceeded to proudly sing the french alphabet to her and to the others who were gathered around us.  Aften I finished singing, the room was silent.  I looked around at the faces.  Many looked stunned and somewhat terrified.  My aunt quickly took me aside and said, &quot;You know your grandma can&#39;t read, don&#39;t you?&quot;  I looked at my grandma, who quickly looked down at the floor.  I felt terrible, but in hindsight, I was just singing a song.  It could have been about anything.  And, if my grandmother had liked it, maybe she would have sung it with me.  If she and everyone in the room weren&#39;t so attached to her illiteracy, perhaps she would have eventually learned to read.  She died with a memory most people at the age of 40 would envy.  She could tell you the year and month of every job she ever had.  She was quick as a whip!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note...like my mom, I never took up french either.  It is stunning what a room full of negativity can do to learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great article about a man who learned to read at 96.  He wrote a book two years later.
