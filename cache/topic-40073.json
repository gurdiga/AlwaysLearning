I mean: I will stop whatever I&#39;m doing to hep someone who truly wants to LEARN about unschooling. About *anything* really, if it&#39;s something I know about and can help with. I LOVE to learn and I LOVE to help others learn. I *ache* to help folks who are truly interested and who want my help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut people who really just want to waste my time? People who want to argue all my points? Not to help themselves understand, but to shoot down all my suggestions and tell me how it won&#39;t work? That it&#39;s rubbish? Fuck &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answers to her paragraphs follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, unschooling is NOT for me and my family for many reasons.   <br/>\nI do believe some of the basic principles (learning is fun, children  <br/>\nlearn from modeling, etc.) however, as a whole I find that it&#39;s core  <br/>\nreally breeds self-absorption.  I don&#39;t see much evidence on any  <br/>\nwebsite that encourages values I find important for my family.  I see  <br/>\na lot of contradiction and don&#39;t really see the &quot;freedom&quot; that  <br/>\nunschoolers preach.  I see a lot of labels being used and many  <br/>\nassumed perceptions and admonishment of what is labeled as  <br/>\nmainstream.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nBummer.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, to admonish, demean or judge anyone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s way of life really doesn&#39;t show compassion and peace.<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nReally?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, there is the legality of this way of life.  In my state, you  <br/>\nmust be a certified teacher to homeschool.  For myself, I have no  <br/>\ncollege education, therefore, to pursue this avenue I would be  <br/>\nbreaking the law.  Many others in my situation go through a facility  <br/>\ndesigned for this reason - to assist homeschoolers- but again there  <br/>\nis a curriculum decided by someone other than the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my father said after attending his first Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>\n<br/>\nConference this year: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Apparently, an essential ingredient in unschooling is for the parents to <br/>\n<br/>\nbe smart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snort&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nLast, my questions are these:<br/>\nWhat is the difference between principles and rules?<br/>\nWhat is the course of action when principles are not followed?<br/>\nWhat is the difference between parent facilitation and a teacher?<br/>\nWhy do unschoolers negate the need for learning unless an immediate  <br/>\nneed exists?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach children to truly compromise?<br/>\nHow does catering to each child/individual teach family values?<br/>\nWhat do you recommend for families that cannot financially keep up  <br/>\nwith childrens&#39; demands?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach a child to assess a situation socially?  <br/>\nMeaning, if a child has been catered to their entire life how do they  <br/>\nlearn to give of themselves or take a passive role in a situation?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach the vital difference between needs and wants?<br/>\nHow does unschooling prepare children for a world that is not catered  <br/>\nto their interests?<br/>\nHow does a child  from this lifestyle learn to be independent when  <br/>\nthe parent has facilitated their needs, wants and learning from day one?<br/>\nThese are just a few of the many questions I have about this  <br/>\nlifestyle.  Any time you could find to answer these would be greatly  <br/>\nappreciated.  Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery single question has been answered on multiple lists ad nauseum. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, my issue is with her antagonistic approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems perfectly happy with her choice NOT to unschool. That&#39;s great. More <br/>\n<br/>\npower to her. She&#39;ll need it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not my goal to convert those who don&#39;t WANT to be converted. I&#39;ll bend <br/>\n<br/>\nover backwards to help someone who WANTS to learn. But I have no time to <br/>\n<br/>\ndevote to someone who doesn&#39;t want to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too much like...TEACHING. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInquisitive Mom of Two Boys<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, not a fan of The Inquisition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40049,"nextTopicId":39959}}
