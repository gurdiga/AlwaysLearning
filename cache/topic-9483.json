Start earlier.<br/>\nI found that kids are most responisve to learning<br/>\nphonics between 1 and 2 years old. They can be taught<br/>\nthe same time you are teaching the other sounds of the<br/>\nworld.  For example...at that age they can &quot;moo&quot; when<br/>\nyou point to a picture of a cow and &quot;oink&quot; when you<br/>\npoint to a picture of a pig.  At this time you can<br/>\nalso easily teach them to make the appropriate noises<br/>\nas you point to the letters.  This gives them a good<br/>\nbase for phonics and what better time to teach them<br/>\nbut when they are so hungry for input and love hearing<br/>\nthemselves make noise.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say is -- ARGH!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe baby probably won&#39;t feel pressured or whatever with this, but the <br/>\nimplication of starting structured learning so early, along with the idea <br/>\nthat it&#39;s already too late for the 5 year old...
