We like it, the girls like it, and it gives us time to wait and watch without worrying about the budget.&quot; It&#39;s also given us time to reflect on our feelings about food and to examine our reactions without acting on them (at least, not in front of the girls).

I am going through<br/>\nSandra&#39;s site today and reading everything she has on food (mainly eating<br/>\nas much as they want). I wish I could say it was easy for me to think<br/>\ndifferently about this, but I am finding it to be so hard. When I see my<br/>\nson eat a half bag of cookies, 6 kiwis, 2 bananas, half a box of crackers,<br/>\n1/4 bag of chips, 1/4 container sliced ham, 1 whole bag frozen mango, and 1<br/>\nsmall container of ice cream (in addition to all his meals) (and probably<br/>\nmore that I can&#39;t remember now) all in one day, I do slip into my old habit<br/>\nof cringing. I am trying to keep that cringe to myself, but I did<br/>\nbackslide and try to talk to my son about amounts the other day, but then I<br/>\nkicked myself for doing it as I knew I had basically started us all over<br/>\nagain as when I came down to check on him he was defensive about the snack<br/>\nhe was eating.&quot;~<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if the problem you are having changing your mindset about food <br/>\ncomes from your own childhood and how you were raised with food. I noticed <br/>\n &quot;portion sizes&quot; mentioned several times and keeping track of everything your <br/>\nson is eating. I had my own baggage surrounding food and sometimes still hear my <br/>\ndad&#39;s voice in my head saying things like &quot;too many starches on your plate&quot; or <br/>\nyour &quot;portion&quot; size is way too big&quot;. Maybe thinking about your own childhood and <br/>\nhow food played a part would help get a clearer picture of why you are having <br/>\ntrouble with this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this goes deeper than &quot;budget&quot; issues and is more about fear of your son <br/>\nhaving weight issues if he continues to eat like he is (though for a growing boy <br/>\nit sounds pretty normal to me). There is SO much information out there right now <br/>\nabout childhood obesity and food issues fanning lots of new ,unnecessary, <br/>\nparental fears. All of my girls (22, 11, and 6) can eat whatever they want and <br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t care that much for the very foods media says is causing obesity <br/>\nin children. Yes once we first started to unschool they experimented with <br/>\nTwinkies and all kinds of foods labeled &quot;junk&quot; but because I had addressed *my* <br/>\nown fears of food it wasn&#39;t a big deal and they learned to listen to their own <br/>\nbodies needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he had a growth spurt and his eating more food is a coincidence to you <br/>\nsaying yes more. Our food budget is constantly changing due to growing <br/>\nchildren.What worked last year when the girls were 10 and 5 has changed and I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad to reevaluate some things. My 11 year old daughter eats more then I do. She <br/>\nis a grazer and has learned to eat when she is hungry. My husband likes to have <br/>\n*his* dinner at a certain time. He is the provider of our home and needs to go <br/>\nto sleep earlier then the rest of us and it makes him happy to eat at the same <br/>\ntime daily. I fix our dinner to be ready for him but that does not mean we are <br/>\nall eating at the same time. Sometimes my 11 year old is full from snacking and <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t eat dinner at all, which ends up saving us money in the long run. If <br/>\nyou are still having &quot;meal times&quot; because of arbitrary rules and not eating <br/>\nbecause of being hungry your son might have trouble learning the difference of <br/>\ntruly eating because he is hungry or just because it&#39;s dinner time and he is <br/>\nsuppose to. Again questioning the reasoning behind the purpose of food and why <br/>\nwe eat could help. This then could tie in with saving money on your budget by <br/>\nnot needing to make as much food or having your own frozen, portion <br/>\nsized dinners already prepared from leftovers causing you to buy less next <br/>\ngrocery trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Help with Amounts of Food","postDate":"1338470620","msgId":67408,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzQ0MwQkFELUExQzctNENDMy04MjdFLTIzM0EzMEVDRTNBNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTHA1eTRpX3pEcWNQcFpoUHNqTUFIMFNEVEtxU19nd1R4YThSVFAtcHNRN0dlYWVod0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpwdW0ybytoMjA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8anEwaGN1KzJmM3NAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxMzM4NDAwMjA1LjI3MTIzLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjI1MDQubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE81MVRBd0hfUUJBQXMxMj15QVRYQkZqVnJZcjN5K3NRQ1ZaaDdLWGNSPUhnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MTMzODQwODc2My41NTAwNi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIyNTA1Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPENBTHA1eTRpX3pEcWNQcFpoUHNqTUFIMFNEVEtxU19nd1R4YThSVFAtcHNRN0dlYWVod0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67407,"nextInTopic":67409,"prevInTime":67407,"nextInTime":67409,"topicId":67364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Everything else I am doing fine with, TV, bedtimes, saying yes more, etc... but I am really struggling with this one.

I am trying to keep that cringe to myself, but I did<br/>\nbackslide and try to talk to my son about amounts the other day, but then I<br/>\nkicked myself for doing it as I knew I had basically started us all over<br/>\nagain as when I came down to check on him he was defensive about the snack<br/>\nhe was eating.  It makes me so mad at myself that I can&#39;t get a handle on<br/>\nthis.  Everything else I am doing fine with, TV, bedtimes, saying yes more,<br/>\netc... but I am really struggling with this one.

(we don&#39;t)  Buying in bulk doesn&#39;t always mean buying EVERYthing in bulk.  I&#39;m selective about what I buy in bulk.  I won&#39;t buy bulk spinach, it goes bad too quickly, but I will buy bulk cheese and meat because the cost of it balances out the inconvenience of finding a location to store it!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help with Amounts of Food","postDate":"1338313086","msgId":67391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpxMzFodSs3anI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxMm5nMSthanJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67390,"nextInTopic":67392,"prevInTime":67390,"nextInTime":67392,"topicId":67364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** Ours did something similar the first couple months of Ray s new diet.

What if what he really wants right now is more food? It could be that the budget you have could stand to be modified, or re-vamped entirely to accommodate changing situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little over six months ago, Ray had a big dietary change. He picked up an infection that he decided to try and manage with diet and ended up eating massively more food than before, and more expensive, organic and specialty foods. It took some time and re-thinking to figure out how to accommodate his needs, and it was pretty tempting to say &quot;good grief, if you&#39;d just eat normally we wouldn&#39;t be spending so much on food!&quot; But that wouldn&#39;t have been very helpful and Ray, at least, would have felt that the budget was more important than his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Hubby and I worked for years and years to be where we are now with our budget, and I am hoping this is not something my son will have to learn the hard way.

Some people over-spend for Exactly that reason - trying to heal old hurts saying yes to all the things they were denied as kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it is true that people learn from other people, it&#39;s important not to get too hung up on the idea of modelling. It&#39;s not possible to know Which of your behaviors you are modelling to each individual child because you can&#39;t know where his or her attention is. Modelling doesn&#39;t equal learning any more than teaching does. My mother was a big fan of weekly menus as a means of deciding what to buy at the store. She can be said to have modeled that for most of my childhood - but I don&#39;t do any menu planning whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;So he knows they are easily accessible and often asks 3-4 times a week.

I am willing to adjust our food budget and know that I will have to, but we went from $500/mo to $1300/mo so that&#39;s a pretty big adjustment to sustain.  This is the reason I am asking for help.  I know this is the first month, so we are bound to have a higher food bill as my son gets used to me saying yes more.   To compensate for that, we have temporarily moved some money around to cover the extra,  but I was looking for some ideas that worked for other people on meeting your kid&#39;s food needs, but keeping some kind of budget in mind (even if our monthly budget ends up being higher than our original $500, I am just hoping it won&#39;t always be as high as it was this month).  Does that make more sense?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading and mulling over what others have said, I think it will be helpful if I speak with my son more about the snacks he wants, and we could work together to get a couple snack choices that are his favorites and buy more of just those specific ones, which might help keep the bill a little lower.  I have already implemented the idea of breaking down the snacks into portion size containers.  He can have as many containers as he wants, but they do give him a better stopping point.  This seems to be working out already as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Since he&#39;s aware of the budget, why not ask him how many times he&#39;d like to eat out a week? That way he can plan. Check with him after a bit to see if it&#39;s enough times a week that you&#39;re &quot;budgeting&quot; in..===<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat ideas!  He does respond well to knowing when something is coming, so if I bring him in on planning when we will go, he may not feel the need to ask anymore.  This will also allow me to make a budget item more precise for eating out, one thing I don&#39;t really have right now.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342782030,"authorName":"K Pennell","from":"K Pennell &lt;mrsringsabre@...&gt;","profile":"mrsringsabre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with Amounts of Food","postDate":"1338246198","msgId":67388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzgyNDYxOTguMjI3MzguWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxMjE3MDUubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzgyMzYzNjcuNzE2ODAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67387,"nextInTopic":67389,"prevInTime":67387,"nextInTime":67389,"topicId":67364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes I just don t have the money.

I also feel hesitant to completely ignore (or beat around the bush about) the fact that there is a budget as it could possibly give the impression that we can buy whatever, whenever.  Hubby and I worked for years and years to be where we are now with our budget, and I am hoping this is not something my son will have to learn the hard way.  I am hoping he can learn it by seeing hubby and I keep the budget in mind when we are shopping.  Perhaps there is an in between there somewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===We are also on a tight food budget for three people. I keep track of expenses and plan budgets using Mint.com===<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn-- thank you for sharing your personal story with me.  Your experiences seem very close to mine and all your tips will be so helpful.  I just wanted to mention that we use &quot;You Need a Budget&quot; (YNAB.com) for our budgeting system.  It is very similar to Mint.com and we have been using it for 6 years now.  It has helped us to be able to keep track of our money so well that we were able to pay off all our debt besides the house and student loans.  It was the only reason we were able to be responsible enough to make the transition from a 2 income-working-outside-the-home family to me staying home with my son and being able to go on this journey in the first place.  A budget is a powerful thing (as you seem to know now too).  It is for this reason that letting my son be aware of our budget is so important to me.  It was a struggle for us to get here and I don&#39;t want my son to go through that too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Either I missed it, or you didn&#39;t say - how old is your son?===<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 8, turning 9 in June.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===I have noticed Jayn starting to willingly reduce her asking for treats, ask for fewer toys, and be willing to wait patiently until I check the budget at the end of the month for extras.===<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is good about this for other extras too.  We do buy him small things occasionally so he knows that we are willing, but if it&#39;s something bigger (more than $25 or so), we do talk about saving up and being able to buy it in the future.  We have talked about keeping a list, but he didn&#39;t feel he needed it.  With food though we have struggled because each item by itself is so small I can&#39;t really say &quot;we&#39;ll save up to buy that snack&quot;.  So this is where I falter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===She also considers which chips to buy, weighs the pleasure of one kind over another, and we are doing pretty well by saving on most of our other basic items===<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I am going to try next with my son.  Perhaps instead of guessing what he wants and buying 5-6 different snacks in large quantities, we can talk about his favorites and only buy 3-4 different things.  That might help us save a little and be more productive for him in meeting his snacking needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===and reducing our fast food, to have enough to buy plenty of her favorite thing===<br/>\n<br/>\nI did want to ask you about this.  Lately my son has been asking to go out to eat more.  I don&#39;t want to keep saying no (or we will next week) to him, but we live in an area where we could walk to a McDonald&#39;s easily, and we drive by other fast food places a lot.  So he knows they are easily accessible and often asks 3-4 times a week.  Again, we have budget concerns with eating out.

Another is lemons, I bought 8 on Friday and they will all be gone and eaten by Monday (4 days). ====<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loves chips too! They are her favorite thing to eat as snacks. She picks and chooses different flavors, tries new kinds, and pretty much always returns to a few specific flavors that she loves most - which are Hawaiian Barbecue and Maui Onion, and BBQ Pop chips. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn also likes to have large bags. When she is done I roll the tops and clip them till next time, which will be very soon. She also likes turkey jerky too, that she can pull from the bag and then reseal. She&#39;s a grazer in that she eats small quantities often, and she often loves monkey platters which she calls &quot;snack trays&quot; of mixed foods in small quantities, while at meals she still tends to prefer predominantly one thing, and just a nibble of the other ingredients of the meal. After all these years she still carbo loads just before a growth spurt. Did I mention that she is now taller than me?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also on a tight food budget for three people. I keep track of expenses and plan budgets using Mint.com. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever unlike many other people with budgets, buying in bulk doesn&#39;t tend to work for us, mostly because we don&#39;t have room for long term storage, plus Jayn and James tend to go on very short jags around particular foods, but really like a lot of variety. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never know exactly when they will both be tired of that particular cereal or another pasta sauce or whatever it is. Alas for the big batch of yummy home made crock pot baked beans I made that languished after only a few servings, even though they did like it. One day I will have the space for a big freezer, and then bulk buying and prep here I come! For us now bulk buying almost always means excess waste. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are a few things that I will buy and keep always, to the limit of our tiny kitchen space, our particular staples. These include mayonnaise, chicken breasts (frozen), salad fixings, bananas, apples, milk, pasta and various tomato sauces, teriyaki, bacon, frozen corn, onions, and Marsala (for sauces). And chips. Jayn generally chooses her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== I have tried to talk to him about the fact that I am only going grocery shopping on Fridays, and I am picking up more than before, but we can&#39;t go shopping every other day for new snacks.  If he eats it all it&#39;s going to be gone for the rest of the week.  ==== <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have found important even on a budget is creating the sense of abundance. When Jayn finds some new taste sensation, she will want to have lots of it, often to the exclusion of other foods. I buy as much as she wants (as we can afford) - packages she finishes to the end fast - then after a while I find myself with a half eaten pack of whatever sitting around until it goes stale. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever while chips, which can be relatively expensive per ounce compared to some foods, continue to be such an important part of Jayn&#39;s happiness, I find I do go out to the store just for more chips other than my main shopping day, or I stop on the way home from other adventures. It may be that once a week is too intermittent for you - although that need not mean more expense if you have a list and a budget plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother part of helping Jayn feel abundant is large servings. She has always wanted more in her bowl, or on her plate, or more in the pot leftover, more available to her than she will finish. Luckily I like leftovers, and I often plan my own meals (tomorrow&#39;s lunch or bubble and squeak breakfast) around the certain knowledge that there will be leftovers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother trick I use to keep our pantry relatively full is to keep one in use (open and in the fridge) and one on the shelf - in the cupboard (or freezer). As soon as I open the one in the cupboard, that item goes on to the shopping list hanging on the side of the fridge. It used to be that Mayo was the key item. When that went on the list it was time to go shopping. Now it tends to be bacon.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== This month my food bill was $900 for 3 people, not to mention $350 for eating out.  Since we are fairly new to saying yes more, should I be buying more and just hope he finds his own balance or is there a good way to talk to him about our budget concerns and food? ===<br/>\n<br/>\nEither I missed it, or you didn&#39;t say - how old is your son? <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is 12. We have only recently - in the last 2 years become comparatively poor. If only we had been living as frugally and mindfully (of expenses) before we might never had gotten into this situation - although being without a regular income didn&#39;t help either. Now we are able to predict our income very clearly. But it has meant a much more present ongoing conversation about money and what is affordable, and how long it might take to afford things. <br/>\n<br/>\nMint.com is really cool because it is very visual. You can look at graphs and pie charts of expenses in categories you define. It can be linked automatically to your bank accounts. Helping set up specific categories even including &quot;Chips&quot; under &quot;Food and Dining&quot; along with &quot;Groceries&quot; might be fun for both of you. You can also set long term savings goals (hah!) and plot out setting aside portions of bills that come at unusual intervals (eg Water and power is every other month).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed Jayn starting to willingly reduce her asking for treats, ask for fewer toys, and be willing to wait patiently until I check the budget at the end of the month for extras. Part of our budgeting is acknowledging what is terribly important to her. Her WOW subscription payment is a permanent line item in the budget. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also considers which chips to buy, weighs the pleasure of one kind over another, and we are doing pretty well by saving on most of our other basic items, and reducing our fast food, to have enough to buy plenty of her favorite thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

We are doing really well, but one issue I need help with is how much food my son is eating.  The variety of food is, and always has been, fine.  He will eat just as much candy and chips as fruits and vegetables.  He will try anything new, and really the only thing he hates is lettuce.  Pre-unschooling we had restrictions on the amount of food my son ate, not because of weight or anything, but because of budget.  Since we have been saying yes more when he asks for more food, he has been eating more.  Unfortunately we have special diet restrictions due to various allergies in the family, so coupons and store brands don&#39;t always work for us.  But we, again, eat a variety of healthy, and not-so-healthy foods.  Anything he wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a for instance, we went grocery shopping and my son picked up 2 bags of Family size Salt and Vinegar on Friday, and he is the only one that eats them, and they are both gone by Sunday night (3 days).

If he eats it all it&#39;s going to be gone for the rest of the week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis month my food bill was $900 for 3 people, not to mention $350 for eating out.  Since we are fairly new to saying yes more, should I be buying more and just hope he finds his own balance or is there a good way to talk to him about our budget concerns and food?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for any help you can provide on any of this.<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67455,"nextTopicId":67442}}
