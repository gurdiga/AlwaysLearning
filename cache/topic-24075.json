In a mother-focussed home, unschooling won&#39;t work very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Labels go too far from about the time they&#39;re brought out and<br/>\n&gt;examined. Let schools have them. We can live with our individual<br/>\n&gt;children and help them have happy lives of learning and growth.<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did think we were talking about what makes a child&#39;s life easier, <br/>\nnot about mother&#39;s wanting to label their kids (I don&#39;t and didn&#39;t and <br/>\nwasn&#39;t looking to ever labal my kids) or about mother&#39;s wanting to <br/>\nfeel better about themselves or whatever by labeling their kids.  Or <br/>\nat least that&#39;s what I was trying to talk about.  Part of the <br/>\nconversation and comments I made were from the perspective of talking <br/>\nabout myself, my own difficulties in different areas, so I think that <br/>\ncaused some confusion, because I wasn&#39;t always talking about my <br/>\nchildren per se.  But in a sense I was talking about my kids too, and <br/>\nwhat it might be like for them to interact with the world firsthand <br/>\nbased on what I know it&#39;s like for me to interact with the world <br/>\nfirsthand.  I was trying to use first hand specific examples and not <br/>\nuse generalities and vagueness, because I have heard Sandra ask many <br/>\ntimes for specifics and actual experiences and not theories and <br/>\nguesses and generalities.  I&#39;m sorry if I did wrong by doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been a really positive discussion overall I think, with a lot <br/>\nof really good information and valid points made and lots to learn and <br/>\ndiscuss.  I know there is lots for me to learn and consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24065,"nextTopicId":24076}}
