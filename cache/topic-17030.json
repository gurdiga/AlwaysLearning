Some people don&#39;t do<br/>\nwell with cookbooks of certain formats, or are not as<br/>\nlinquistically inclined and find following a recipe<br/>\nbothersome.  They like to experiement.

If the dad doesn&#39;t cook much,<br/>\nwhat does he like to eat?  What do the kids like to<br/>\neat?  Where do they go out to eat if/when they do go<br/>\nout?  People usually cook what they like to eat, and<br/>\ngo from there.  If they like pasta, get him some good<br/>\ntools for cooking or serving it.  If he likes a<br/>\ncertain type of ethnic food, cookbooks and tools for<br/>\nmaking that.  If he likes quick meals try a blender or<br/>\npressure cooker and recipes for smoothies or soups and<br/>\nthings.  If he likes easy cooking and is patient, a<br/>\ncrock pot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally the best things to have in the kitchen are<br/>\nA: well made to withstand the abuses of cooking and <br/>\nB: easy to use and clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the best gift for him, if he&#39;s really a babe in<br/>\nthe woods in the kitchen, would be some lessons in<br/>\ncooking fun and easy meals that he and his family will<br/>\nenjoy.  Some fun dinners getting everyone involved in<br/>\nthe cooking and sending them home (or leaving them<br/>\nwith, if they are at their home) recipes and maybe a<br/>\nsmall gift or two for making each dish might be a more<br/>\nmemorable and fun gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] to stock a kitchen","postDate":"1067286523","msgId":17072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDcwMWMzOWNjOCRlYWJkNjlhMCQ2NTAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PGJuZ3VudSs1dm51QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDFiMzAxYzM5YmU1JDg5ZjZiYTEwJDE0ZGMwMDQ0QEFvcGVuPiA8M0Y5QzBFMjQuNDA0MDIwMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8Ni4wLjAuMjIuMC4yMDAzMTAyNjEzMzE1MS4wMjU4OGFhMEBzaGF3bWFpbC5ndi5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0PiA8M0Y5QzY4QTAuNDAzMDdAZWMucnIuY29tPiA8MDAzOTAxYzM5YzlmJDE5NDM5YjIwJDA5YTMwMTQ0QHJpLmNveC5uZXQ+IDwzRjlENzdFQi4zMDcwODAzQGVjLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17071,"nextInTopic":17074,"prevInTime":17071,"nextInTime":17073,"topicId":17030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pressure cookers could not be easier.

The one I saw was at Kitchen, etc. and basically looks like a blender with a spout.  My kids love smoothies, especially in the summer.  I think they enjoy it so much because they get to put the ingredients in by themselves (relatively easy) and they really enjoy the fact that they can try different things. Also, I think a pizza stone is great too.  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Alice <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 26, 2003 7:36 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] to stock a kitchen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Though I don&#39;t often post much, I&#39;d like to get some advice from you guys.

If they are cooking vegetarian, a modern pressure cooker and pressure cooker cook book (Lorna Sass has an excellent one) is a marvel -- beans without soaking in an hour or so, risotto without stirring, 5 minute lentil soup -- also a thing I use all the time.  Other things I use frequently, an electric rice cooker, garlic press, pizza peel and baking tiles, vitamix blender (I am the queen of gadgets).
