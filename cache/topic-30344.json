At the risk <br/>\nof being redundant, I want to mention that many computer and video <br/>\ngames are full of math concepts.  Both of my children have learned <br/>\nlots of math and other great benefits from computer and video <br/>\ngames.  Zoombinis is one that they have used. Some of our other <br/>\nfavorites are anything from Humongous Entertainment(many focus on <br/>\nlogic and problem solving, but their arcade games tend to have more <br/>\nmathmatical concepts)  There are also some more *educational* <br/>\ntitles, like the &quot;Jumpstart&quot; series, and Edmark titles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther great ways to play with math are by cooking together, building <br/>\nthings together (tools, measuring, etc.) playing with blocks of <br/>\nvarious shapes and sizes (geoblocks are really nice),etc.  All of <br/>\nthese are things that can be accessable to and involving of a wide <br/>\nage range, and can grow and change with the child&#39;s abilities and <br/>\ninterests.  Something that I used to do when my children were <br/>\nyounger was to keep small measuring tapes in my purse, one for each <br/>\nchild, the kind that retract easily.  Whenever we were shopping, or <br/>\nout and about, they had the option of taking out the measuring tape <br/>\nto &#39;measure&#39; things while I did the boring shopping (though <br/>\ninvolving them in shopping decisions has lots of math - my kids <br/>\nloved to measure produce for me when they were younger - 3yo and up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lovely thing about using various games and life experiences for <br/>\nlearning is that there is a broader focus; it is not just *math* <br/>\nthat is focused on, but lots of things are being learned while <br/>\nhaving fun.  The key is that whatever is done should be fun for the <br/>\nchild, rather than chosen by the parent for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix years old is still quite young.  So much learing has happened, <br/>\nwithout &#39;formal&#39; instruction.
