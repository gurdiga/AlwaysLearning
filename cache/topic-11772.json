Nobody<br/>\n&gt; could believe it.  We had married at 17 and had been<br/>\n&gt; married almost 17 years and it wasn&#39;t easy on either<br/>\n&gt; of us to divorce but we wanted to keep things as easy<br/>\n&gt; as we could.  We did a do-it-yourself divorce for $75<br/>\n&gt; and I let him have the house and basically everything<br/>\n&gt; in it, traded our weekends with the kids when we<br/>\n&gt; needed to...  The judge sure seemed to have not seen<br/>\n&gt; such an easy divorce.  Of course, we weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We had the opportunity to do our divorce so simply.  Because he was military <br/>\nwe could have lawyers on base advise us, and we just would have to pay the <br/>\nfiling fees.  I tried to do that, but each time I&#39;d present the papers to <br/>\nRuss he&#39;d spend over a month with them, and then do them incorrectly.  He was <br/>\nmessing with me - as he had the house, and all the military retirement going <br/>\nto him (by law half was mine, but he didn&#39;t have to give it to me until the <br/>\ndivorce was final).  Russ&#39; orginal family history was that control of the <br/>\nmoney was tied to &quot;love&quot;.  He was mad, and I was to suffer.  It didn&#39;t matter <br/>\nthat the kids were suffering too.  He constantly re-enforced my decision to <br/>\nend the marriage!<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11764,"nextTopicId":11743}}
