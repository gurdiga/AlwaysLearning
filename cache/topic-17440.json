What you have to do <br/>\ndepends on your laws and regulations.  Be sure to read them <br/>\ncarefully.  Sometimes they really require very little, though myths <br/>\nmay build up about these requirements.  And sometimes, even when they <br/>\nappear to require a lot, there are no teeth behind the regs, no way <br/>\nto make you stick to whatever you give them.  In other words, you are <br/>\njust giving them an outline, a guideline, and you are then free to do <br/>\nwhatever you want.  In most cases no one can hold your feet to the <br/>\nfire to ascertain whether or not you followed that guideline.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as how much time we spend goes, I have no problem giving them <br/>\nthe max required, since we have learned that almost every living <br/>\nmoment of every day is a learning moment, a learning experience, so <br/>\nwe are quite comfortable with the amount of time we spend on learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will have to comb your regs thoroughly and read them like a <br/>\ndebate team member would.
