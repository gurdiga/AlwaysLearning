Wow, I get teary just<br/>\nimagining my kids being those ages!  I think I&#39;m going to have a major<br/>\ncase of empty nest syndrome some day! (on the one hand, it&#39;s so great<br/>\nthat i will be able so spend so much of their lives with them, as<br/>\nopposed to them living in school most of the time, but then at the<br/>\nsame time, it will be that much harder to see them go, having been so<br/>\nclose!!)

I haven&#39;t seen a copy in a while,<br/>\nbecause we just moved and were getting settled, but I just got the<br/>\nlatest copy and was SO bummed that your column wasn&#39;t in there.

I think I may not be radical enough for that list, so<br/>\nI will probably remain a lurker there. I definitely have no rules<br/>\nregarding my kids&#39; education and learning, but I haven&#39;t yet reached<br/>\nthe point where I would let them forgo brushing their teeth, etc., etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the welcome!! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLouise<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://millenniumhippies.blogspot.com\">http://millenniumhippies.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi, Louise!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I used to have some 5, 3 and &lt;1 kids who are 18, 16 and 13.<br/>\n&gt; Seems like a lifetime, and for them, it is!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s a collection of typical days collected in one place for the  <br/>\n&gt; overwhelmment of my readers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical_\">http://sandradodd.com/typical_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical)\">http://sandradodd.com/typical)</a> <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Welcome to the list. <br/>\n&gt; Do you know about the AlwaysUnschooled list?
