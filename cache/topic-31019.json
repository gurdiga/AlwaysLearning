She pulled her kids out of school to &quot;homeschool&quot;.  When she does attend homeschool get togethers (about once a year) she tells people &quot;I homeschool, but I don&#39;t&quot;  If they ask what she means by that she says that she &quot;unschools, kind of&quot;  She really does nothing with them.  She doesnt work, but lives off of welfare, her house is beyond messy, and her kids are always playing video games at the neighbors house or running around outside unsupervised.  She admits that she doesnt do anything with them, but someday she&#39;d like to.  It&#39;s been 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a huge difference between unschooling and not schooling, but to &quot;outsiders&quot; they probably look the same.  People question all the time what we are doing and they agree that it is good educational stuff, but most people not familiar with it, still want to see book work and test scores.<br/>\nHarmony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  -------Original Message-------<br/>\n&gt;  From: beanmommy2 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beanmommy2@...\">beanmommy2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Imposter&quot; homeschoolers<br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Oct 11 &#39;07 1:57pm<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I recently had an interesting conversation with someone I had just<br/>\n&gt;  met.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  She had several grown children that she homeschooled for over a<br/>\n&gt;  decade, beginning in the eary 90&#39;s.
