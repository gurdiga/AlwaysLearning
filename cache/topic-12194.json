They are more apt to adapt to a wide variety of people and <br/>\ncan relate to others , perhaps in more depth. How you behave as a human <br/>\nbeing becomes more important than your  perceived status.<br/>\nThis is a good thing , also, because although my sons are rather <br/>\nconservative ( more or less, whaterver that mean) in their out-look, <br/>\ntheir mother doesn&#39;t like to be.  Considering our mix bag  of ancestors <br/>\n( french, english, two different groups of natives, irish, scotish, <br/>\nbelge...)  we don&#39;t fit in an ethnic group either.
