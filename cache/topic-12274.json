His career defined and documented the modern history of<br/>\nblacks in American film. This notably shy and private man portrayed proud and powerful characters. His depiction of<br/>\nblacks on the stage, in the movies, and on television was and remains revolutionary. More than an actor (and<br/>\nAcademy-Award winner), Poitier is an artist -- a writer and director, a thinker and critic, a humanitarian and diplomat.<br/>\nHis presence as a cultural icon has long been one of protest and humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead more at:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/poitier_s.html\">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/poitier_s.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been sickened by the focus of money, money, money of this country.<br/>\nIf going to school means you&#39;ll make money......why are college grads. working retail & fast food?<br/>\nThere is no guarantees there will be a job when you get out of school.<br/>\nAnd what is the point of making big bucks if you never have time to enjoy life or the people you love?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times have we all heard the stories of people struggling to go and pay for schooling, working hard, long hours<br/>\nall their lives and dying before they get a chance to even live.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney shouldn&#39;t be the main focus of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand if there are things you want out of life that are pricey, you&#39;ll have to find the way to afford them.<br/>\nHowever, that is not for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may make life easier sometimes but, it won&#39;t love you or make your life worth living.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings, Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 9 Feb 2003 09:01:05 -0700<br/>\n   From: &quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:astrologerdawn@...\">astrologerdawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Destination Imagination (was &quot;a yucky bit from NYT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that the school believes money is the &quot;thing&quot; we ought to be<br/>\nfocusing on that makes us &quot;wealthy&quot;.  What about the love we have to<br/>\ngive to others, ourselves and doing something we love for a living that<br/>\nwe are passionate about, regardless of the money it brings us.  It also<br/>\nleaves out those people that didn&#39;t finish high school and still became<br/>\nfinancially wealthy such as Dave Thomas the founder of Wendys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as usual the school is single minded in its belief that money is the<br/>\nanswer to everything and that money will make everything better.  Ask<br/>\nthose people who become instant millionaires when they won the lottery<br/>\nwhat it did for them emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a vast difference between someone who &quot;drops out&quot; of<br/>\nschool and someone who voluntarily doesn&#39;t go to school at all because<br/>\nthey choose to use the world as their way of learning.  Even the drop<br/>\nouts have the right idea when they don&#39;t want to stay in school because<br/>\nthere are bored, uninspired and cannot connect with what adults<br/>\ndisguised as &quot;teachers&quot; believe they need to know.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12266,"nextTopicId":12272}}
