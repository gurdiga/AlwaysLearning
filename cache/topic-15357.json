Yeah!!  The kids were pretty <br/>\ndisenchanted with the whole zoo experience. Maybe they&#39;re just too young at <br/>\n2 and 4 to really get it.  Perhaps zoos are just really silly places when <br/>\nyou think about it.  Most of the animals weren&#39;t out and we were there with <br/>\nmy brother and his family who live where the zoo is and were &#39;jaded&#39; (as my <br/>\nbrother said).  I think the only one who really liked the zoo was me.  <br/>\nBecause heck, I like things like that&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while we lived near enough to the Pt. Defiance zoo to buy the annual pass.  It really changes the experience.  We felt free to go and visit just one or two animals per trip, rather than feeling that we must see everything in our one (expensive) day at the zoo.  Our visits spring through fall were the best - few crowds and the animals were usually more active.  When it gets to hot they like to hide in shady places and sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe visited the San Diego zoo two years ago.  Happened to hit it during October when kids are free.  It was cool to see the exotic animals that we&#39;d only seen on tv or books.  Up close, giraffes are REALLY tall and each zebra really does have a unique stripe pattern.

My parents rented a cottage on the lake in <br/>\nour town for the week. I don&#39;t think I would recommend a vacation so <br/>\nclose to your own home because it involved a lot of running home to do <br/>\nthe laundry and water the plants, etc. On the other hand, it was good <br/>\nbecause if we needed new clothes or food or whatever, it was less than <br/>\nten minutes to home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe absolute best part of the whole thing was the ducks. Aislinn, 7, and <br/>\nElysia, 5, sat out on the dock as still as statues for hours getting a <br/>\nmother duck and her 8 babies to trust them. After the second day, even <br/>\nSoleille the 2 yr old was sitting with them. That mother duck finally <br/>\nlet her family within 1 foot of the girls and let them play in the water <br/>\non the edge of the lake while she preened her feathers. It was awesome! <br/>\nAnd the girls and I got to listen to her talk to her babies and see how <br/>\nthey would listen to her. We talked about how she was teaching them how <br/>\nto live and stay alive on the lake. We also saw a male and female loon <br/>\nbut further out (the lake is called Loon Lake).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all it was really fun and a lot cooler on the edge of the lake <br/>\nthan at home. The first few days of the week reached 96 degrees.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext vacation: Myrtle Beach and Columbia, South Carolina, August, <br/>\n2003!!!!

We ve been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2129501235\">I just got back from an eight day vacation with my family.  It was glorious!<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background.  My husnamd and I have been married 5.5 years.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen cmping together exactly twice.  Once at a huge Family Reunion where we <br/>\nwere very much the babies.  Ok, we were married and had a nearly one year <br/>\nold but aside from driving ourselves there in a car bought for me by my <br/>\ndaddy we had little to no responsibility for the camping.  We didn&#39;t plan <br/>\nthe food or the campground or any thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second time was just last year when we went for a weekend at a friends <br/>\ncabin.  Again, besides driving ourselves there (well following our friends <br/>\nthe whole way) we didn&#39;t do mych.  they purchased the food, they made all <br/>\nthe plans we were just along for the ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this vacation was really a first for us.  W planned the whole thing <br/>\nourselves, from where we&#39;d go to how long we would stay, what we would eat, <br/>\nwho would clean up.  All of it.  This IS a big deal for us, as taking <br/>\nresponsibility for ourselves is a rather new experiecne for us.  And we were <br/>\non our own.  Just us and the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started off in Portland Or, visiting with my brother and his family.  We <br/>\nwere dismayed to learn that the more expensive a hotel the less free stuff <br/>\nyou get!  LOL  My sis in law has a friend who works at a Marriot and was <br/>\nable to get us a friends and family discount for the weekend.  the hotel was <br/>\noriginally $114 a night (ok, that&#39;s a LOT to me, maybe not to some) and we <br/>\nwere able to get it for $54 a night.  The room was adequate but nothing <br/>\nspecial, not even a microwave of anything!  Maybe I&#39;m spoiled but here at <br/>\nhome where I live we could have had a night in one of our best hotels for <br/>\n$114 a night complete with in room Jacuzzi, mini fridge, microwave, the <br/>\nworks!  And this hotel didn&#39;t even have a complimentary &#39;continental <br/>\nbreakfast&#39;.  They had a breakfast buffet that was $8.95 a person(my four <br/>\nyear old too!) so we went to McD&#39;s instead.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK enough about the bad time we had in the Hotel.  We went to the Portland <br/>\nZoo and didn&#39;t really get rained out!!  Yeah!!  The kids were pretty <br/>\ndisenchanted with the whole zoo experience. Maybe they&#39;re just too young at <br/>\n2 and 4 to really get it.  Perhaps zoos are just really silly places when <br/>\nyou think about it.  Most of the animals weren&#39;t out and we were there with <br/>\nmy brother and his family who live where the zoo is and were &#39;jaded&#39; (as my <br/>\nbrother said).  I think the only one who really liked the zoo was me.  <br/>\nBecause heck, I like things like that.   By the time we left Portland we <br/>\nwere all GLAD to be leaving Portland.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were headed to the beach next.  Cape Lookout on the Oregon coast for <br/>\nthose who know the place.  It was great we camped in the woods and it was a <br/>\nbrief 3 minute (ok, maybe 10 minute with kids and crap) walk to the sandy <br/>\nbeach.  It was windy and chilly but wonderful!  It was so neat to watch my <br/>\nkids in their &#39;natural habitat&#39; outside all the time.  :)  My son at two is <br/>\na natual explorer.  I don&#39;t think there would be anything better to him than <br/>\nthe last week.  So much to see!  I have so many pictures of him in the <br/>\nadorable little 2yo discovery squat.  You know the one, the crouched down <br/>\nsitting on heels staring intently at something in the dirt.  Everything <br/>\nfascinated him!  At the beach or at the campsite he was never bored.  Even <br/>\nwhen DH and I were both reading our books he was happy as a clam <br/>\nentertaining himself endlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD at 4 is not as easily entertained.  She&#39;s the most social one of the 4 of <br/>\nus.  I knew this long ago but now it almost defies description (well to me <br/>\nanyway).  Each time we would go to the beach she would immidiatly jump into <br/>\nthe middle of the closest group of kids and soon be by to introduce me to <br/>\nher new &#39;best friend&#39;.  While my 2yo wandered all over the beach &#39;alone&#39; my <br/>\n4yo was easily found by searching out the largest group of kids and looking <br/>\nin the center of it.  She has a particular adoration of biys in the 11-14 <br/>\nage range ;) ?!?!  All the kids were very nice.  When we went to the beach <br/>\none evening and there were no children she managesd to charm her way into a <br/>\ngroup of teens who let her bury them in the sand.  And when the weather <br/>\ndrove us away from the bach and back to the campsite she made friends with <br/>\nthe lady camping &#39;next door&#39;.  She would go hang out at this woman&#39;s fire  <br/>\n(Susan, who makes soap and ended up giving us some for my birthday which was <br/>\nthursday).  When she packed up and went home on Thursday morning Kathrynn <br/>\nwaited about 15 minutes before introducing herself to the &#39;grandparents&#39; on <br/>\nthe other side of us.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really neat to see her interacting with so many people of so many <br/>\nages.  And my family is worried about &#39;socialization&#39; - HA!<br/>\n<br/>\nI so want to move to the coast!  My husband drags his feet (as always about <br/>\neverything!) but I tried to explain to him that my soul needs to live close <br/>\nto the ocean, the woods, the green, and the blue!  And glorious humidity!  <br/>\nWhere I live in eastern WA all is brown, tan, grey, and DRY!  *SIGH*<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that was my summer vacation.  And we made it the whole way, on our own, <br/>\nwe&#39;re home now, happy, proud, and tired!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
