Sugary foods provide quick calories and energy for the high energy demands of a growing body. And at least one study suggests that sugary foods help children feel better, reduce pain and generally help induce feelings of physical comfort. Some researchers think that growing bones secrete hormones that increase metabolism and may act on the brain to increase appetite for high energy (sugary) foods. So, he�s right when he say the Oreos make his brain work better! : ) I think you can relax.<br/>\nYou can follow some links in this article that expand on some of the claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological\">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHeather Booth wrote:<br/>\nI just read what you added to the &quot;Sugar as a scary substance&quot; page by Deb Lewis.<br/>\nI got a fairly large tattoo when I was 30 and before I went for my first day my tattoo guy told me to bring fruit or candy to suck on because it helps with pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was cool when I put those things together.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65991,"nextTopicId":65901}}
