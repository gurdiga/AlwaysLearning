I&#39;ve been taking<br/>\nthe last several days to mull over the things that you&#39;ve each offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was considering all these perspectives yesterday it occurred to me that<br/>\nI&#39;ve not done a very good job of making sure that my husband&#39;s home office<br/>\nis tidy. Our family&#39;s PC has been in there for the last 8 months or so and I<br/>\njust realized what this has meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I awakened with a plan-of-action in mind today. I thoroughly cleaned his<br/>\noffice -- which really needed it. Then I moved the PC and desk to the living<br/>\nroom. This will leave his office with his desk, his bookcases and his stuff.<br/>\nAnd then I mopped and polished the hardwood floors in there. I&#39;m leaving it<br/>\nfor him to rearrange and organize the room however it suits him, but it is<br/>\nvery clean now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve called it my &#39;making sure papa has a restful nest&#39; project.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe house may not always be tidy, but at least his room can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for moving the PC, I wish I had done that sooner. Not only is it out of<br/>\nthe office space, now I can sit on the sofa and knit (or email) and still be<br/>\ninvolved in what they are playing and ask questions. Theo and Whinnie (3)<br/>\nare sitting together playing Zoombinis right now and it is fun to see what<br/>\nthey are enjoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the boys and their rooms, I&#39;ve simply been asking that they do<br/>\nspecific (short, easily-accomplished) tasks. I&#39;m not forcing anything. Today<br/>\nI asked eldest child, Nic (10) to please put away his clean clothes and move<br/>\nclothes any needing washing the laundry room. He did it cheerfully and 5<br/>\nminutes later he was back to doing what he wanted. Then I asked middle guy,<br/>\nTheo (6) to make a pile of dirty clothes at his door so that I could get<br/>\nthem to wash. He didn&#39;t get them all, but he did make an effort and that was<br/>\nall I was wanting for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:D<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247634197,"authorName":"Julie Anderson","from":"&quot;Julie Anderson&quot; &lt;star_ryder@...&gt;","profile":"julie6302001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: keeping tidy rooms","postDate":"1270601661","msgId":52531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3QTI1NUI5MkVERTQ4OUFBQThBRkExMTkzRTlCQzY1QENvbXB5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":52520,"nextInTopic":52544,"prevInTime":52530,"nextInTime":52532,"topicId":52477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have 3 daughters, two grown up and one still at home.

I grew up in a messy house because there were 7 of us, and my Mom just couldn&#39;t keep up.  It was always cleaned eventually.  My mother-in-law only had three and she was a clean freak.  I never saw her house dirty before in 25 years....she cleaned her pots before the meal was served so we only spent about 10 minutes in her kitchen after family gatherings.  At my Mom&#39;s after family gatherings...it took about 2 hours to clean up afterward!    I learned from my Mom how to have an inviting home and function in a messy house! I learned alot of creative tips from my mother-in-law how to keep a home tidy and have seen creative people come out of homes run by clean freaks too!  <br/>\nI am a  messy but love to organize.....I used to organize my mom&#39;s cupboards for fun!!   Learned some tricks throughout the years to maintain clean and orderly our very large house with large  family .....My husband still prefers more tidy, free of clutter  then the rest of us in our home.   He really likes the hotel feel!  He travels alot.  I used to blame  it on his up bringing and business travel but after living with him for 25 years it is just the way he is wired.....I have seen him adapt to living in the 3rd world and even living in a hut for 2 years with 2 kids just fine!  Of course our hut was very tidy and orderly!  All our kids are very relaxed when it comes to messes, but have the skills to clean and be orderly.  They like the balance of both extremes.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: keeping tidy rooms","postDate":"1270577522","msgId":52518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDRTgzNERBLTNFM0MtNEQ5Ni05QjIzLTdCNDU2MTY5MDgyMUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwZnI5ZCtqbmhkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwZnI5ZCtqbmhkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52516,"nextInTopic":52520,"prevInTime":52517,"nextInTime":52519,"topicId":52477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m the kind of person who doesn&#39;t own a lot and likes things to be neatly put away out of sight. He&#39;s the kind of person whose room always looks like a suitcase exploded in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found our way to a measure of peace after we read a book called &quot;Organizing for the Creative Person&quot; (wow, here it is at Amazon, amazingly still in print: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ycb4uk9)\">http://tinyurl.com/ycb4uk9)</a>. It talked about how some people like to have everything neatly labeled in folders and drawers out of sight, and some people like to have their stuff around them. Really, we should have been able to just accept each other without a book validating us, but it just really helped us see that there wasn&#39;t a right or wrong way about how each of us did things, just preferences. And the insights in the book helped my friend stop trying to force himself into a put-things-away model that was never going to work for him and creatively think about how to organize his space in ways that worked for him. For instance, we hung about a million clothes hooks in his room and installed a lot of shelves, and he bought some more laundry baskets and, instead of always feeling bad that he hadn&#39;t put away his clothes &quot;properly,&quot; made storing his clean clothes, neatly folded, in laundry baskets just part of the way he did things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I seem to have sacrificed in order to have kids is the order I crave, and it is hard for me. My partner isn&#39;t troubled by what I see as mess and clutter, and I find myself so overwhelmed by clutter in the environment that I can&#39;t keep it the way I want it to be. It&#39;s something we are constantly working on and looking for solutions for, and sometimes the best I can do is just take a few minutes to imagine David and me in retirement, in our tiny little minimalist condo with everything put away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: keeping tidy rooms","postDate":"1270575213","msgId":52516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwZnI5ZCtqbmhkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFEMjQ1NTVBNTIxNDRFOTNCN0Q3NUEzMjVGODI4REIyQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg=="},"prevInTopic":52515,"nextInTopic":52518,"prevInTime":52515,"nextInTime":52517,"topicId":52477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ...

He vacuums his room every week, dusts his bookshelves.  He makes his bed.  He didn&#39;t have chores and didn&#39;t have to keep his room tidy.  It just happened over the years that his tendency toward order worked into a desire for orderly space.   If he wasn&#39;t a naturally orderly person I don&#39;t think making him clean could have made him one.

He has a highly technical and creative job and he just can&#39;t concentrate well with visual clutter.  One of the things we do to help accommodate his need for order in our (rather chaotic) home is to have at least one room where things are put away and where &quot;stuff&quot; is kept to a minimum.  Usually we try to make this the dining area which means that the table is clear so people can sit there with laptops or sit and read, talk, dare i say eat?  But sometimes dd wants to set up dolls or a huge craft project or something at the dining room table and then it helps if I clear up the living room.  If all the public spaces are teaming with projects, toys, equipment, then I find he tends to disengage from the family to go find a less chaotic space.  He&#39;ll be in our bedroom or out on the front porch.  Possibly your husband has this kind of personality, he may be physically or mentally uncomfortable around all the flotsam that accompanies having free, creative, active children.  If so, making an effort to help him get that need met may result in less criticism of the kids and their &quot;messes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula Moyer<br/>\nThe Seer, the novel <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] keeping tidy rooms","postDate":"1270561656","msgId":52502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDNTE1QUZBLThBMEEtNDZGNS1BODczLUVBQzYzQUM5N0RDMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHAybTc5YzFkMWI0MTAwNDA2MDAxMG05ZWZiOGYyemI2NzA0MzRmNGEwMjg0MTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhwZGl0Yitoc2dsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8cDJtNzljMWQxYjQxMDA0MDYwMDEwbTllZmI4ZjJ6YjY3MDQzNGY0YTAyODQxNEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52501,"nextInTopic":52506,"prevInTime":52501,"nextInTime":52503,"topicId":52477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He didn t have an answer, since what I said was essentially true (I m smart in my cruelty).-=- Thoughts like that will bite you in the ass.

Tom showed this in the study of MZAs. When  <br/>\ntwins are reared apart in very different environments they often  <br/>\ncreate their own environments and these turn out to be very similar.  <br/>\nThe best example is a set of British twins reared in very different  <br/>\nhomes in which one had educational opportunities available and the  <br/>\nother didn&#39;t. But the less advantaged twin got a library card and read  <br/>\nthe same books that her sister was reading at home. And their IQs were  <br/>\nvery similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim Bouchard: That striking case highlights the general point that  <br/>\neach organism creates its own environment. So our conception of the  <br/>\nenvironment as &quot;something out there&quot; that&#39;s static or fixed and stamps  <br/>\nits influence on us is really wrong. The &quot;environment,&quot; and I&#39;m not  <br/>\nsure that&#39;s even the right word, is something that is literally  <br/>\ncreated by the organism.

And the nuns would come  <br/>\nover and hit me with a ruler and say, &quot;Tom, pay attention!&quot; But I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t dazed, I was doing all kinds of things. My environment was in  <br/>\nmy head. And that&#39;s what lots of people do. Some do more of it, some  <br/>\nless. Different kids focus on dramatically different things. Some like  <br/>\nto work with their hands, while others like abstraction.

I&#39;m busy with other things and just really don&#39;t care that much - I <br/>\nalways have something better to do (like writing this post, eating fresh <br/>\nstrawberries, chatting with my husband, and watching the basketball game <br/>\non tv - all the things I&#39;m doing right now).<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of my house I&#39;m a neatnik - when we&#39;re camping or staying in a <br/>\nhotel or someone else&#39;s house, I&#39;m always straightening up and clearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were messy like me - their own rooms were usually messy when <br/>\nthey were growing up. At 22, Roxana lives in an apartment with 3 other <br/>\ngirls and SHE is the neatnik of the four of them. She&#39;s organized and <br/>\nclean. She&#39;s the one who gets the other girls to wash floors and take <br/>\nout trash, etc. Her clothes are all neatly hung up or folded in drawers, <br/>\netc. Roya, 24, lives in her own house and she&#39;s way more regular at <br/>\nhousework than I have ever been. My youngest is 19 - she lives at home, <br/>\nhas her own room. It gets messy and then she straightens it all up and <br/>\nmakes it nice - it is picked up and nice more often than messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - none of the three of them took after me and my messy ways even <br/>\nthough I didn&#39;t &quot;train&quot; them to keep their own space clean.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135408777,"authorName":"Helen Cain","from":"Helen Cain &lt;hfcain@...&gt;","profile":"saaitje67","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: keeping tidy rooms","postDate":"1270523295","msgId":52489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcuMC4xLjAuMi4yMDEwMDQwNjEyNTg0OC4wMjdlMTA4MEBvcHR1c25ldC5jb20uYXU+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyMzk2NjU2LTk2MUYtNEVGRi1CMDYwLTJDOUI2ODYwMzg4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhwZHZzYytwbnNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTIzOTY2NTYtOTYxRi00RUZGLUIwNjAtMkM5QjY4NjAzODgwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52488,"nextInTopic":52491,"prevInTime":52488,"nextInTime":52490,"topicId":52477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I asked him to go really look at the elder son&#39;s room after our conversation. Yes, there were legos everywhere (they defy any attempts at control/organization, don&#39;t they?) and there were clothes here and there. He admitted that his initial glance was deceptive.

I remember helping occasionally, but honestly I did not a great deal. She never fussed at me. In fact, she never really asked me or even showed me how to do things around the house. I had to learn fast when I moved into my own apartment. Even though I was not forced to be tidy or clean, As an adult, I have never desired to have my home be untidy or unclean. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince my children were toddlers, I&#39;ve involved them in the things I do for our family.

Actually, I don&#39;t either, really. Our house isn&#39;t too bad most of the time. Simon and Linnaea will lend a hand when asked. And the other day, appropos of nothing, Linnaea folded all of her clothes in her dresser drawer. Without being forced to do those things they can do them as gifts, as joys, as passing fancies, with being forced, they can never do them as a gift, never. Gail Higgins has a fantastic blogpost about her children gifting her a clean kitchen: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/2009/07/just-clean-kitchenor-is-it.html.\">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/2009/07/just-clean-kitchenor-is-it.html.</a> And while that may be a moment to remark on, I don&#39;t remember doing that, not once, not ever, for my parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a particularly tidy person. David mentioned the other day about how in my room in the house I shared with friends while at university it was quite difficult to walk for debris. I had a chore chart with gold stars and bed making and room tidying as part of it. I can remember being grounded to my room until I would clean it. Nothing made cleaning come easily to me except time and a desire to find things. I still don&#39;t put away clothes well. There is a heap of clothes in my bedroom, all clean, that must be a few weeks worth of laundry (don&#39;t have a dryer, so what would have taken a couple of days with a dryer takes a few weeks with a line and a dampish climate). And I still can&#39;t clean quickly or easily; I have to sort and put away and not just tidy. It makes my cleaning a dedicated affair and any distraction can lead me off track. I am so very distractable. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what that offers you to tell him, but maybe some of the ideas are about seeing things as messy. I don&#39;t always see a mess that David may see. David is amazingly good at just cleaning, just tidying. And Simon and Linnaea certainly don&#39;t see a mess where I might. They aren&#39;t looking for a mess, they are looking for engagement with the world and cleaning isn&#39;t how they do that, yet. But when they want something, like Simon wanting a Yugioh card, he has a pretty good idea of where it is, which deck to look through first. It&#39;s like David talking about my room being untidy, while I couldn&#39;t believe the state of his papers and his files and his kitchen floor. The details of my life that I wanted to be in order were in order and the rest wasn&#39;t important. As it was for him. As it is for Simon and Linnaea. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting to hear someone else&#39;s fears for their children. Your husband wants your children, his children to succeed and to not have their crazy, out of the box childhoods&#39; to cost them ostracism and joblessness. That&#39;s pretty powerful love and anxiety all mixed together. In whatever conversation you have, if you start knowing that, well, that&#39;s a good place to start. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: indywhited &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:indywhited@...\">indywhited@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 5 April, 2010 21:58:19<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] keeping tidy rooms<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Mary, mama to three children, ages 10, 6 & 3.
