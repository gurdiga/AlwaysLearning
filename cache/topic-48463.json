I had one of my three who was often like <br/>\nthis, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some of the problem is getting the momentum going in the direction of <br/>\nleaving, rather than the kids trying to play full on right up to the <br/>\nmoment of leaving. They need to ramp the playing down and turn toward <br/>\nleaving, then take a little step in that direction, etc. Giving them <br/>\nlots of warning can sometimes help with that, but sometimes it is just <br/>\nannoying and builds UP the frustration of leaving. Imagine you&#39;re <br/>\nplaying, intensely involved - totally into the play world. Someone keeps <br/>\ncounting down how much more time is left - taking you out of the world <br/>\nyou are so enjoying, over and over. You get frustrated at the constant <br/>\ninterruptions and when they finally say, &quot;Okay, time to go now,&quot; your <br/>\nfrustration level boils over. Although the advice to give lots of and <br/>\nfrequent warnings before time to go, I think some parents are very rude <br/>\nabout it. Give ONE warning, maybe 5 to 10 minutes ahead of time, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t do a countdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - instead of it seeming to suddenly be &quot;time to leave&quot; - better to <br/>\nget them out of what they&#39;re doing and getting ready to leave, right? We <br/>\nhad goodbye rituals - at friends&#39; houses, the goodbye ritual was that I <br/>\nwould go and join them as they played and show an interest in what they <br/>\nwere doing. I&#39;d ask a few questions, maybe, &quot;Who is the mommy?&quot; &quot;Who is <br/>\nbeing the baby?&quot; Just start to talk &quot;about&quot; their play a little. If they <br/>\nwere building things, I&#39;d ask questions about that. In other words, take <br/>\nthem a bit out of their play world and more into looking &quot;at&quot; it. Hope <br/>\nthat makes sense. Then I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay, well, I&#39;m here to help clean up - <br/>\nso how can I help?&quot; I&#39;d get them going toward cleaning up a little. Even <br/>\nif all they did was play around me while I picked a few things up - it <br/>\nchanged the atmosphere. All done very happily and cheerfully - not <br/>\ndemanding that they clean up right now, just me spending a little time <br/>\ngetting some things put away. Sometimes I&#39;d hand one of them something <br/>\nand ask, &quot;Can you put that in that red bucket over there?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we&#39;d start goodbyes - we&#39;d talked in advance about what to say when <br/>\nsaying goodbye. &quot;Thank you for inviting us to your house.&quot; &quot;I really <br/>\nliked playing house today.&quot; &quot;I liked playing with the blocks.&quot; Something <br/>\nlike that. For my very shy kid, I&#39;d ask her - do you want me to say your <br/>\ngoodbyes? And I&#39;d just say it for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we brought something to give to the people whose house we were <br/>\nvisiting, but I&#39;d save that to the end and ask the kid who was having <br/>\ntrouble leaving, &quot;Do you want to get the X out of the car and give it to <br/>\nyour friend?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - finally, I&#39;d say to all the kids, &quot;So this was really fun, wasn&#39;t <br/>\nit? Do you guys want to get together again, soon?&quot; And they&#39;d all say <br/>\n&quot;YES&quot; and I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll plan on it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last was really important to Roya who always wanted to know that <br/>\nwe&#39;d make more plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time we&#39;d spent half an hour or so on all this stuff - we were <br/>\nnot interrupting their play to leave, anymore, and it became way easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a lot to write out - but really from beginning to end, <br/>\nincluding clean up time, it wasn&#39;t more than 15 to 30 minutes max.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191977698,"authorName":"Christine","from":"&quot;Christine&quot; &lt;honeybee@...&gt;","profile":"christine.altman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: wearing out our welcome","postDate":"1257538802","msgId":48467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhkMjBkaSthZzRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3MEJCRjBGLUI1RTMtNDUyRC05ODRDLUFFRjNFOUYxQUE1MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48466,"nextInTopic":48468,"prevInTime":48466,"nextInTime":48468,"topicId":48463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m going to try this approach, I ve avoided saying, if we don t leave now, we won t be invited back! which might be true, but sounds like a threat.

I like the the idea of explaining it your way, a gesture of thanks and keeping our end of the deal. I&#39;ve been groping for the right way to explain it to her and this feels better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it&#39;s clear, I need to determine a time when it is appropriate to leave, and reinforce the idea of leaving in the above manner before we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just explained it to my daughter and she nodded understanding, that&#39;s positive. I&#39;ll keep at it and see how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, do you have a kid way to explain those times when it&#39;s not an appropriate or comfortable time for me to nurse? That is the other area of contention in our lives, right now. Sometimes they just ask for too much, (not dissimilar to the overstaying our welcome) I don&#39;t want to interrupt my dinner simply because one or both prefers human milk to water, juice or the food available at that moment, for example. I&#39;ve been at a loss with this one, too. When I&#39;ve gone away for the day, they aren&#39;t worried about it at all, and it certainly isn&#39;t an issue of having been limited!<br/>\n<br/>\n-c<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But as to trying to reason with her about people needing to make  <br/>\n&gt; dinner or you needing to go home, I would just go with &quot;It&#39;s time.&quot;   <br/>\n&gt; If the visit is scheduled until 3:00, when it&#39;s nearly 3:00 say &quot;The  <br/>\n&gt; visit is nearly over.  We have to leave when visits (or parties, or  <br/>\n&gt; movies) end, because it&#39;s part of the way we thank them, is to keep  <br/>\n&gt; our end of the deal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s an if then.  &quot;You can come over at noon if you leave at 3:00.&quot;    <br/>\n&gt; When people overstay and throw a fit, it&#39;s less likely they&#39;ll be  <br/>\n&gt; welcomed back.  It&#39;s true of restaurants and hotels and swimming pools  <br/>\n&gt; and everywhere.  But talk to her about this when it&#39;s between visits,  <br/>\n&gt; not when you&#39;re there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to getting twins out, maybe you could ask the one who finds it  <br/>\n&gt; easier to leave to help you get things out to the car while you carry  <br/>\n&gt; her sister.   It doesn&#39;t need to be seen as splitting their team and  <br/>\n&gt; it being you two against the other one.  It could be &quot;How can we help  <br/>\n&gt; her be happier and not embarrassed and frustrated?&quot;  The other twin  <br/>\n&gt; might have some ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest, Kirby, was that way when he was three, four, five.   <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I carried him out crying, but I would say something like &quot;I  <br/>\n&gt; think this means he had a really nice time.  Thank you.&quot;  And in the  <br/>\n&gt; car I would say I knew he didn&#39;t want to go, but I wanted that mom to  <br/>\n&gt; be willing to invite him back over, so it was better to let them have  <br/>\n&gt; their house back because it was time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t really understand &quot;time&quot; but they don&#39;t really understand  <br/>\n&gt; making dinner or going home to work, either, so go with what&#39;s real.   <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a negotiable thing, when someone visits me.  If they say  <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll be here two days and they decide to stay five days and it&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; their thought and not my decision, how is that okay?  Way different if  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m having so much fun I ask them if they can arrange to stay  <br/>\n&gt; longer.   So it&#39;s not a half and half between you and the other mom.   <br/>\n&gt; If you say &quot;She needs to make dinner,&quot; then it seems that if you could  <br/>\n&gt; only bring her a pizza or something, the child could stay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So go for clarity and real, honest kid-world reasons.  They will be  <br/>\n&gt; considered good guests if they leave nicely on time, and good guests  <br/>\n&gt; are more likely to be invited back.  It&#39;s an investment at a level  <br/>\n&gt; even little kids can understand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] wearing out our welcome","postDate":"1257532455","msgId":48465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzNTExLjIzNjM1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3MEJCRjBGLUI1RTMtNDUyRC05ODRDLUFFRjNFOUYxQUE1MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhkMWoxZCtwNzMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QzcwQkJGMEYtQjVFMy00NTJELTk4NEMtQUVGM0U5RjFBQTUwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48464,"nextInTopic":48466,"prevInTime":48464,"nextInTime":48466,"topicId":48463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some kids find it hard to transition from one activity to another specially if they are having fun.

And she&#39;s engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to trying to reason with her about people needing to make  <br/>\ndinner or you needing to go home, I would just go with &quot;It&#39;s time.&quot;   <br/>\nIf the visit is scheduled until 3:00, when it&#39;s nearly 3:00 say &quot;The  <br/>\nvisit is nearly over.  We have to leave when visits (or parties, or  <br/>\nmovies) end, because it&#39;s part of the way we thank them, is to keep  <br/>\nour end of the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an if then.  &quot;You can come over at noon if you leave at 3:00.&quot;    <br/>\nWhen people overstay and throw a fit, it&#39;s less likely they&#39;ll be  <br/>\nwelcomed back.  It&#39;s true of restaurants and hotels and swimming pools  <br/>\nand everywhere.  But talk to her about this when it&#39;s between visits,  <br/>\nnot when you&#39;re there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to getting twins out, maybe you could ask the one who finds it  <br/>\neasier to leave to help you get things out to the car while you carry  <br/>\nher sister.   It doesn&#39;t need to be seen as splitting their team and  <br/>\nit being you two against the other one.  It could be &quot;How can we help  <br/>\nher be happier and not embarrassed and frustrated?&quot;  The other twin  <br/>\nmight have some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, Kirby, was that way when he was three, four, five.   <br/>\nSometimes I carried him out crying, but I would say something like &quot;I  <br/>\nthink this means he had a really nice time.  Thank you.&quot;  And in the  <br/>\ncar I would say I knew he didn&#39;t want to go, but I wanted that mom to  <br/>\nbe willing to invite him back over, so it was better to let them have  <br/>\ntheir house back because it was time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t really understand &quot;time&quot; but they don&#39;t really understand  <br/>\nmaking dinner or going home to work, either, so go with what&#39;s real.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a negotiable thing, when someone visits me.  If they say  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be here two days and they decide to stay five days and it&#39;s  <br/>\ntheir thought and not my decision, how is that okay?  Way different if  <br/>\nI&#39;m having so much fun I ask them if they can arrange to stay  <br/>\nlonger.   So it&#39;s not a half and half between you and the other mom.   <br/>\nIf you say &quot;She needs to make dinner,&quot; then it seems that if you could  <br/>\nonly bring her a pizza or something, the child could stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo go for clarity and real, honest kid-world reasons.  They will be  <br/>\nconsidered good guests if they leave nicely on time, and good guests  <br/>\nare more likely to be invited back.  It&#39;s an investment at a level  <br/>\neven little kids can understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191977698,"authorName":"Christine","from":"&quot;Christine&quot; &lt;honeybee@...&gt;","profile":"christine.altman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"wearing out our welcome","postDate":"1257525101","msgId":48463,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhkMWoxZCtwNzMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48464,"prevInTime":48462,"nextInTime":48464,"topicId":48463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m new to the group as well as parenting and would so appreciate some suggestions of strategies I can employ to help my daughter end a visit more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-213751650\">Hi, I&#39;m new to the group as well as parenting and would so appreciate some suggestions of strategies I can employ to help my daughter end a visit more joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 year old twin girls, who are free, unscheduled, nursed on demand, and share our bed. They both LOVE their extended family and when we visit our grandparents or cousins, have a hard time leaving. I don&#39;t even bother with short visits, and I warn people not to invite us over unless they want us there for a few hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my spouse is with me, we give the children fair warning that we have to leave soon, and when it&#39;s time, we each pick up one and carry them out to the car together. In this situation, I have one daughter who consistently leaves willingly and happily, and another who is devastated, and cries all the way home. We comfort her by reciting her favorite story of the moment while we drive. Her pain at leaving is awful, and it breaks my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am alone with them visiting, I&#39;m in trouble. Twins working together have amazing skills to thwart and elude a single parent trying to catch them and escort them out the door. Frankly, if it weren&#39;t for the fact the we begin to intrude on someones space, schedule, or whatever, I&#39;d sink back down on the couch and enjoy a cup of tea, while I waited for them to either fall asleep, or ask to go home. They have more staying power and focus than that, and because of our lifestyle, we live on a completely different schedule than the rest of our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I haven&#39;t tried anything creative, like leaving a trail of reese&#39;s pieces to the car door(that just popped into my head, and I&#39;m gonna try it!), I have tried reasoning with them, and pointing out that so and so wants to have their dinner, or needs to get ready for bed, and that we have to respect the needs of others. Or that I need to get back home to do work I&#39;ve agreed to do, and make some money. Once in a while this is successful, but mostly not. I know that these talks are not in vain and I will continue to do this.  <br/>\nRight now, what happens is I get anxiety about wearing out our welcome, and I become a drill sergeant after talks have broken down. &quot;That&#39;s it, I&#39;ve had it! Now you do this, and you do that, and get your coats and get your shoes...&quot; I don&#39;t like being a drill sergeant, and because often, when I holler, the floodgates open and I rant and rave as well, about feelings of martyrdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still hear crying all the way home, and have too much adrenaline coursing through my veins to recite funny stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have to give up visiting, and hope people come over our house? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd can anyone break down what&#39;s going on with my daughter who so doesn&#39;t want to leave? I think it&#39;s more than just having so much fun and not wanting it to end. We have fun at our house too, but she&#39;s always up for going out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48471,"nextTopicId":48411}}
