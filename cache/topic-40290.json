For older teens, possibly yes in showing that it is <br/>\npossible to enjoy gaming and still be a good Christian.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some debate over the accuracy of the ratings for some games <br/>\nalthough overall there seems to be a relatively high level of trust in the <br/>\nMSRP ratings system, with the debate leaning to the conservative. EG if it <br/>\nsays T for Teen, many forum users are likely to think it should really be M, <br/>\nand restricted to a point. No one seems to think the ratings system is too <br/>\ntough on games.

I started to add it to my video games page,  <br/>\nbut was wondering whether someone here (or more than one someone)  <br/>\nmight be interested in looking through some of it and letting me know  <br/>\nwhat the Christian aspect of it is.  Is it to help parents accept  <br/>\ngaming?  Are games reviewed in terms of whether they&#39;re acceptably  <br/>\nmoral to play?<br/>\n<br/>\n(If no one feels like looking at it, that&#39;s fine too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christian-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-bros-3\">http://www.christian-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-bros-3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI found it looking for a particular image from Super Mario Brothers 3  <br/>\nfor an article on how my kids learned math that I wrote for a German  <br/>\nparenting magazine.  The translator wrote asking for clarification on  <br/>\nsomething and I figured a picture would help.    Kinda convoluted,  <br/>\nbut that&#39;s okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40476,"nextTopicId":40969}}
