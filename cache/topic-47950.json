We planned on only offering healthy foods, etc. etc. When I discovered Unschooling and read about how limitations can cause more desire for the forbidden fruit it made so much sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago we started having, for lack of a better word, &quot;issues&quot; around food.<br/>\nWe&#39;d give Logan food, and he would ask for something else.<br/>\nHe&#39;d say, &quot;I want something in the fridge&quot; <br/>\nWe would open the fridge door and make him offers, which he would refuse, and then he would get very upset.<br/>\nMy husband Paul and I kept offering other options not realizing we were overwhelming him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it clicked for me.<br/>\nI would try the Monkey Platter not just as a snack concept for him, but for his meals as well. It has worked like a charm.<br/>\nHe has a tray type plate with pictures of monkeys on it which he loves.<br/>\nNow, either I bring him his favorite foods on the tray, or I ask him what he wants on his Monkey Plate. He always includes an interesting assortment of foods from grapefruit, (his favorite food), to M & Ms. He usually eats the fruit, cheese, veggies, or meats more, and picks at the sweets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to things like sweets/snacks, we have a cabinet under the counter that Logan can reach. There are things like chips, pretzels, nuts, raisins, and cookies in there.<br/>\nI do buy the healthier versions of most of these things when I can, (Whole Foods has a version of M&Ms) although he prefers Teddy Grahams to Annie&#39;s Natural Bunnies, so that is what we buy :)<br/>\nHe really enjoys telling me he is going to go to his little cabinet and get a snack.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night at dinner he ate a ton of Swiss Chard, choosing it over the cookies on his platter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still melt downs, but they usually occurr if my timing is off and he is very hungry or tired before I bring him his food.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have another situation that we need help with, which I will describe on another post.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47946,"nextTopicId":47978}}
