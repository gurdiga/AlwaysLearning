My first <br/>\nthought was, how the hell does she know that? I didn&#39;t think school was <br/>\nsupposed to be  *fun*.  I never had *fun* in elementary school, (just the <br/>\nopposite, I remember a lot of bad things like when I snuck into class and <br/>\nchanged a grade in the teacher&#39;s book, and once hiding in a storm drain <br/>\nbecause I was scared to go to a summer school class), middle school was a <br/>\nnightmare, high school I did have fun cutting class, skipping school, or <br/>\ngetting high at lunch.  Somehow I don&#39;t think that lady had that in <br/>\nmind.  In retrospect maybe she was trying to convince the girl, brain wash <br/>\nher, to believe that being incarcerated in a government institution would <br/>\nbe fun. What, I wonder, is her definition of fun?  This morning I called my <br/>\nschool-age boys over and said, today, you are NOT going to school, and <br/>\nyou&#39;re gonna have FUN!!!

There also needs to be some plan in your mind of where<br/>\nyou want to get, and some measurable goals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, I&#39;d have him define &quot;GOALS&quot;---what are HIS goals for your <br/>\nchildren?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes HE have some plan of where he wants them to &quot;get&quot;---and how would <br/>\nHE make  that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem, which he will find &lt;g&gt;, is that there is no way to predict <br/>\nany of that. The other problem is that *your* and *his* goals may not <br/>\nbe those of your children. What would he do/how would he feel THEN, <br/>\nwhen he finds that he&#39;s made all these plans towards this goal that <br/>\nwere unnecessary or damaging to his relationship with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many adults feel that they are disappointments to their parents <br/>\nbecause they aren&#39;t doctors or lawyers?<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery day they live, your childen are learning. Every day, they are <br/>\nworking towards the goal of happiness and towards satisfying needs that <br/>\nTHEY have (not yours).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also said something that I thought was interesting: &quot;Anytime I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried to accomplish something, or see someone else try to accomplish<br/>\nsomething, having no plan or goal just does NOT work well. It leads to<br/>\nsloppiness, and to things you hoped would happen never getting done, or<br/>\ngoing in circles with where you want to head, that kind of thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly WHAT do he think the plan or goals should be?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is automatically assumed that a child who loves animals should <br/>\nbecome a veterinarian. BAD goal---not because it&#39;s not a worthy <br/>\nprofession, but because that&#39;s the ONLY profession people think of. The <br/>\nGOAL should be loving more animals, learning to care for them, being <br/>\nwith them. If the child *wants* a profession in veterinary medicine, <br/>\ngreat---but there are HUNDREDS of other animal-related careers--just <br/>\nput on your thinking cap! Plus---maybe the child just simply LOVES <br/>\nanimals---there doesn&#39;t have to be a career involved! Just animals to <br/>\nlove.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour PLAN for that child shouldn&#39;t be latin and greek and biology and <br/>\nchemistry (unless the child likes these things!). It should be <br/>\naccepting more animals in your home. Making arrangements to visit more <br/>\nanimals. Finding opportunities to BE with animals. Finding more <br/>\nanimal-knowledgable people for that child to hang out with. If that <br/>\ntheads to a career in animals, gret. If it leads to a life filled with <br/>\nthe things that child/adult loves (more animals)---that&#39;s even better!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\nThe reason I thought that was interesting was that, in general, I have<br/>\nfound that to be true for me as well. Usually when I approach<br/>\nsomething, whether it&#39;s the laundry or a career change, I have some<br/>\nsort of goal or plan - or even steps to follow - in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you set up a CURRICULUM to get you to that point? Or would you <br/>\nsurround yourself with like-minded people, with the best tools you can <br/>\nafford, with as many opportunities to try that thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about IMMERSING your child in his passion---that should be your <br/>\nplan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd keep in mind that it could *change*  tomorrow. Children can be <br/>\nfickle! What&#39;s fascinating today can be old news tomorrow. Be flexible <br/>\nand willing to change gears at his whim.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... I&#39;m wondering how much &quot;intentionality&quot; or &quot;planning&quot; is, or<br/>\nshould be, or could be, involved in unschooling. Surely it&#39;s not years<br/>\nof just wandering aimlessly with no structure, goals, hopes, or plans<br/>\nof any kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to follow their leads. I intentionally smooth the path in front <br/>\nof them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing &quot;aimless&quot; about what they are interested in at any <br/>\ngiven moment. THEY have purpose and goals. Maybe long-term, maybe not. <br/>\nBut *I* am here today wo help them get where they are going TODAY!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.
