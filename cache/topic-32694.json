Worry, frustration,<br/>\n&gt; resentment, annoyance, etc. -- all are manifestations<br/>\n&gt; of resistance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Clinging to resistant thoughts takes a lot of energy<br/>\n&gt; -- energy that *could* be easing your path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ironically, parents often complain about (i.e.,<br/>\n&gt; resist) not getting enough sleep. When you resist that<br/>\n&gt; condition, the resistance drains your energy, causing<br/>\n&gt; you to need even more sleep!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course it&#39;s good to get as much rest as you can<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re exhausted. But you can also balance the<br/>\n&gt; equation from the *inside* by releasing the resistance<br/>\n&gt; that creates the stress that makes you tired --<br/>\n&gt; including your resistance to tiredness itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today (and tonight) notice how you talk and think<br/>\n&gt; about sleep and rest. Gently release any thought that<br/>\n&gt; feels stressful. Imagine that every time you release a<br/>\n&gt; resistant thought, it&#39;s like giving yourself an hour<br/>\n&gt; of sleep. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailygroove.net/exhaustion\">http://dailygroove.net/exhaustion</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to forward this message to your friends!<br/>\n&gt; (Please include this paragraph and everything above.)<br/>\n&gt; Copyright (c) 2008 by Scott Noelle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Inspiration & Coaching for Progressive Parents&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ScottNoelle.com\">http://www.ScottNoelle.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.EnjoyParenting.com\">http://www.EnjoyParenting.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1044 Water Street, Suite 342<br/>\n&gt; Port Townsend, WA 98368<br/>\n&gt; USA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32691,"nextTopicId":32717}}
