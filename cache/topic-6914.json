We went to the lawyer on base (he was <br/>\nso thrilled thinking it would be a big case - he was tired of power of <br/>\nattorney).  In the end I found an ad in Mothering magazine to write to this <br/>\n&quot;church&quot; and get a letter from them saying that vaccination was against our <br/>\nreligion.  I sent them a donation!!!  That worked to get us exempt from the <br/>\ngovn requirement.  Used that old letter again when my oldest son was in the <br/>\ncollege dorm and they said he needed to have something - I think MMR??  <br/>\nAnyway, we went to Okinawa in our sadly unvaccinated state :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn American friend had Ok. midwives at her homebirth.  Her husband was not <br/>\nmilitary.  I went to an Ok. clinic to get set up for my Rh- shot after birth. <br/>\n Told the young doctor there that I had had all my babies at home (not true, <br/>\nunfortunately).  He just gave me tubes to collect cord blood.  When we went <br/>\nin for the shot, an older doctor was there and was VERY disapproving of what <br/>\nwe had done, but did give me the shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think attended homebirths were ok there, but the majority of women went to <br/>\nbirth centers and had doctors for &quot;western&quot; style births.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6913,"nextTopicId":6812}}
