So - the parents&#39; &quot;job&quot; or &quot;joy&quot; is to really <br/>\nget themselves &quot;in tune&quot; with the kids - be aware of what interests them <br/>\nbecause that really IS what they need. Believing that the kids will make it <br/>\nclear what they need - that we can trust them to do that - I think that is <br/>\nreally what unschooling is about. BUT - it doesn&#39;t mean just leave them alone <br/>\nand wait for them to come to us and say, &quot;It occurs to me, mom and/or dad, <br/>\nthat I&#39;m interested in studying trigonometry.&quot; It means noticing that they <br/>\nlove movies or skateboarding or videogames or hours of reading or <br/>\neavesdropping on adult discussions or digging in the mud or that they <br/>\nremember the names and characteristics of songs, plants, animals, foods, <br/>\nfamous people, certain time periods, clothing styles, war battles, airplanes, <br/>\nor that they SEE a lot - that they notice things with their eyes, that they <br/>\nnotice colors or shapes or patterns. Every kid is completely different mix - <br/>\nunique. So every parent has to observe their own kid and figure out what they <br/>\ncan do to support that particular child.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling means parents support what they notice in their kids, NOT try to <br/>\nlimit it - or get around it to make them more well-rounded and not say things <br/>\nlike, &quot;He doesn&#39;t seem to want to read nonfiction much, so I got him these <br/>\nbooks about motorcycles to try to get him to read more of it.&quot; In other <br/>\nwords, I&#39;m not talking about &quot;using&quot; their interests to manipulate them into <br/>\ndoing what we want them to do. I&#39;m talking about REALLY supporting their <br/>\ninterests. If a kid is interested in motorcycles, if reading books isn&#39;t his <br/>\nway of learning, then don&#39;t get him books and make him try to learn about <br/>\nmotorcycles that way as a backdoor to getting him to read more. On the other <br/>\nhand, get him books and magazines as a way of supporting him learning more <br/>\nabout motorcycles and then be happy if he looks only at the pictures or asks <br/>\nyou to read to him or whatever.  <br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6616,"nextTopicId":6607}}
