It took me a long time to understand that it wasn&#39;t *me* that was being &quot;burned at the unschooling stake&quot;&nbsp;but rather that someone was responding to&nbsp;thoughts that came up from what I had written or from the subsequent exchange, and that those ideas being presented&nbsp;could possibly, likely be pertaining to&nbsp;SOMEONE, now or later.

People will respond to ideas directly or indirectly launched by the OP - extrapolate and talk about it in a general way, the you not always being &quot;you-the-original-poster&quot; but <var id=\"ygrps-yiv-1272754243yiv8541291474yui-ie-cursor\"></var>you, we, someone - a parent.
