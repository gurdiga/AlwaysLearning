She was pretty verbal early on, so you<br/>\ncould actually have conversations with her at 2. <br/>\nAnyway, we were driving in the car once and she<br/>\nstarted telling me about what life was like when she<br/>\nwas &quot;a little girl&quot;. She told me that when she <br/>\nwas a little girl everything was white (a snowy<br/>\nplace?), and there were no trees around. She described<br/>\nthe setting a little more and then told me <br/>\nabout her mother (!).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me her mother died when she was a little girl<br/>\nand she was very sad about it. It has always made me<br/>\nwonder if she had a fabulously developed imagination,<br/>\nor if whe was recalling a past life, or (I hope not)<br/>\nseeing into the future (we now live where there aren&#39;t<br/>\nmany trees and it&#39;s <br/>\nwhite for 6 months out of the year.) No matter what,<br/>\nit was an odd conversation to have with a 2 year old.<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t remember any of it now. She&#39;s 7.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow! This sounds familiar. Tamzin (also 7) would tell<br/>\nme in great detail about her &quot;mummy&quot; she used to have.<br/>\nShe said that she had brown skin and they first lived<br/>\nin a hot place and then they went on a long trip to a<br/>\ncold place (she said she was always cold after that).<br/>\nShe was 2 and a few months the first time she<br/>\nmentioned this. She gave details about things that she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly know about (that&#39;s what convinced me<br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t purely imaginary). She says she never<br/>\ngrew up (I assume that means she died as a child -<br/>\nmaybe from the cold?). She still remembers her &#39;family<br/>\nfrom before&#39;, but she rarely talks about them anymore.<br/>\nAlso the only place in the world that she really wants<br/>\nto go to is Africa, always has been. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1472,"nextTopicId":934}}
