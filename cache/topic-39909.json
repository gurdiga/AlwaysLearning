Alex already asked &quot;what do your KIDS want?&quot;.  I have known what my kids want, for years, it has been art supplies, or a scooter or skateboard, or soccer ball, things like that.  My problem is that I haven&#39;t gotten past my issue of asking for something.  We are in financial crisis though, and some of our family isn&#39;t.  Unfortunately, I grew up being shamed for wanting anything, and i&#39;m trying to get past this for my children.  I&#39;d love for them to have a nice x-mas present (ours will happily come from the dollar store again this year), and I know some of the grandparents can get them something nicer.  problem is, I already know they are thinking toys.  They have plenty, and they have told me they would love art &quot;stuff&quot;, and a soccer ball.  I honestly don&#39;t know how to mention that they would rather have these things.  They ask it like &quot;what sort of toys do they want?&quot;  The fact is they don&#39;t WANT a toy.  How would some of you approach this?  I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m greedy in asking for something other than toys.  We could really use things like pencils, notebooks, plain paper, construction paper, I just am having a problem with HOW to ask for something other than what THEY want to give.  I know I need to put on my Big Girl Pants....I just don&#39;t know how to approach this.<br/>\nHope this isn&#39;t considered a post hijack!
