I found a book called Advice to Mother by Pye Henry Chavasse.<br/>\n(Chavasse was an Obstetrician in the late 1800s.  )  I was so shocked to<br/>\nread that it was common advice in the Victorian period to acknowledge<br/>\nthat even then, it was perfectly reasonable for children to only prefer<br/>\ncertain foods and that forcing children to eat is &quot;a sin and a shame&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very timely for me as I am anticipating a holiday gathering<br/>\nwhere certain older eyes in our family go to the plates of our sons<br/>\nwatching for empty dishes.  Our sons have yet to please their<br/>\ngrandparents in this department and I don&#39;t choose a holiday gathering<br/>\nas a time to really get into an argument.  At least now I have a little<br/>\ninner peace knowing that even in eras gone past, not eating  everything <br/>\nand not cleaning your plate was not a big deal.  It can be easy to think<br/>\nthat the opinions and beliefs of older family members represent &quot;How it<br/>\nhas Always Been&quot;.  Not so, at least, not always.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a bit from this old book....<br/>\n<br/>\n163. My child has an antipathy to certain articles of diet: what would<br/>\nyou advise to be done?<br/>\n<br/>\nA child&#39;s antipathy to certain articles of diet should be respected: it<br/>\nis a sin and a shame to force him to eat what he has a great dislike to:<br/>\na child, for instance, sometimes dislikes the fat of meat, underdone<br/>\nmeat, the skin off boiled milk and off rice-pudding. Why should he not<br/>\nhave his likes and dislikes as well as &quot;children of a larger growth?&quot;<br/>\nBesides, there is an idiosyncrasya peculiarity of the constitution<br/>\nin some childrenand Nature oftentimes especially points out what is<br/>\ngood and what is bad for them individually, and we are not to fly in the<br/>\nface of Nature. &quot;What is one man&#39;s meat is another man&#39;s poison.&quot; If a<br/>\nchild be forced to eat what he dislikes, it will most likely not only<br/>\nmake him sick, but will disorder his stomach and bowels; food, if it is<br/>\nreally to do him good, must be eaten by him with a relish, and not with<br/>\ndisgust and aversion. Some mothers, who are strict disciplinarians,<br/>\npride themselves on compelling their children to eat whatever they<br/>\nchoose to give them! Such children are to be pitied!<br/>\n<br/>\nMel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58276,"nextTopicId":58395}}
