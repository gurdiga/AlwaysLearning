If someone were to learn to read music by a<br/>\n&gt; method like that, they would be handicapped for reading the notation<br/>\n&gt; of the past 300 or however many years.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The point of this book is to learn the music so well you can play <br/>\nwithout sightreading it.  As an admittedly non-musical person, I found <br/>\nit helpful.  I would have found it helpful if someone else had written <br/>\nit, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"One smart isn&#39;t all-smart","postDate":"1174662973","msgId":28297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFRjg1RTU2LTIzMUQtNDFGNy04MjExLTA0OTcwODVGRTk2MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28299,"prevInTime":28296,"nextInTime":28298,"topicId":28297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s a name for God (Thor or Odin, I was going to ask my husband but he s not at his desk; how can he not be available whenever I need an answer about Norse","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-438336997\">There&#39;s a name for God (Thor or Odin, I was going to ask my husband  <br/>\nbut he&#39;s not at his desk; how can he not be available whenever I need  <br/>\nan answer about Norse mythology!?) from a thousand years ago,  <br/>\n&quot;Allfather.&quot;  It&#39;s a cool word.    I like it.    And I thought of  <br/>\nthat when I wrote &quot;all-smart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day Holly asked me what an average IQ was.  I said &quot;by  <br/>\ndefinition, 100, but 95-105 is considered average, I think--but IQ  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean much anyway,  it&#39;s only measuring language, and...&quot; and  <br/>\nshe said &quot;Because my IQ is 101.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;No it isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I realized I had stepped into where I didn&#39;t want to be.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we talked about IQ a bit, and then I tried to extricate myself  <br/>\nfrom it. &lt;bwg&gt;  She had taken some online IQ test.  I talked about  <br/>\nmultiple intelligences (which I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be doing until I die).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I bought a book<br/>\nclassical works produced by William F. Buckley, which uses the method<br/>\nhe found worked for him: every black-key note is printed in red.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s kind of  horrible!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it speaks to the idea of IQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam F. Buckley is a virtuoso at word use.  It doesn&#39;t stop him  <br/>\nthat others don&#39;t know what those words mean, he just continues for  <br/>\nthe effect of intimidation, more than communication.  There&#39;s an  <br/>\nelement of The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes to it; if you can&#39;t see what he  <br/>\nmeans, then you&#39;re an idiot.  If you say &quot;You&#39;re only talking to  <br/>\nyourself, because no one else understands you,&quot; then you&#39;re a  <br/>\nPhilistine, ignorant, jealous.   So...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...  he&#39;s wealthy and he plays piano and he feels he&#39;s plainly,  <br/>\nflatly, smarter than anyone around him (because he was always a  <br/>\nverbal prodigy, and verbal is where it&#39;s at, IQ-wise).  So he thinks  <br/>\nit will help everyone to have... black keys, really?  Not just all  <br/>\nsharps and flats in a given key?   printed in red, like the words-of- <br/>\nChrist-in-red editions of the Bible &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusically, though, to have some notes in red will be confusing.  The  <br/>\nred notes would still be on the same scale, the same proportions, the  <br/>\nsame relationships to the other notes.  So setting them apart like  <br/>\nthat will ONLY be a clue for piano, and not for any other  <br/>\ninstrument.  It&#39;s vandalistic to notation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I&#39;m playing something, if there&#39;s a note I keep missing  <br/>\nbecause its a C sharp, for instance, and I&#39;m forgetting, I get a  <br/>\npencil and draw a diagonal line through the note.   Later I might  <br/>\nerase it if it&#39;s distracting me or if I have it so well I just don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant others to think I was a baby and needed lines through my notes.  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  (I&#39;ve rarely erased them, but could if I wanted to, because it&#39;s  <br/>\npencil.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would make more sense to reprint books with all the silent letters  <br/>\nin red, or something.  I think &quot;learn to read and stop whining,&quot;  <br/>\nthat&#39;s what I think.  If someone were to learn to read music by a  <br/>\nmethod like that, they would be handicapped for reading the notation  <br/>\nof the past 300 or however many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>\nBeing verbally intelligent isn&#39;t everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28314,"nextTopicId":28259}}
