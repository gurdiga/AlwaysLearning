It&#39;s more that I don&#39;t (can&#39;t) read for a long time, then swoop in <br/>\nto snatch some great ideas...and I think a homeschool resource center is <br/>\na great idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we started our homeschool theater group several years ago we began <br/>\nrenting space in an old church (congregation of about 45, mostly <br/>\nelderly). The space was very affordable and we brought life (and money) <br/>\nto the church people. Over the years I&#39;ve thought many times about how <br/>\ngreat it would be to buy the building and use all the classrooms for <br/>\nhomeschooling activities: classes, clubs, a lending library, a science <br/>\nlab, etc.--even maybe turn the sanctuary into a basketball court. The <br/>\nbig problem would be maintenance, since old buildings are notorious for <br/>\nthat; there would probably also be safety issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe theater has taken up so much of my time that the resource center <br/>\nidea never got developed, but I&#39;m interested in seeing what ideas can be <br/>\ngenerated by other people about that. Just imagine homeschoolers from <br/>\nall around knowing there&#39;s a place to go to hang out and be in touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan, whose cousin, a public school teacher her whole life (as was her <br/>\nmother, my aunt) has been visiting us for a week now...and neither of us <br/>\nhas mentioned homeschooling to any extent....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7910,"nextTopicId":7904}}
