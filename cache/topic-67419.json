That would be considered the<br/>\n&quot;decoding reader&quot; stage of reading.  It might seem silly to call that<br/>\nreading - since there isn&#39;t much point to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think reading without comprehension means they can read the words, one at<br/>\na time, but in doing that process they are not putting the words together<br/>\ninto sentences that have overall meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are reading: &quot;The dog chased the black cat,&quot; the same way they would<br/>\nread a list of words such as, &quot;dog, tree, house, sleep, blue, go.&quot; It is<br/>\nwhat happens when children are learning to decode words and all their focus<br/>\nis on that. My kids never did that - because they were reading for meaning<br/>\nfrom the beginning - getting meaning was the point of reading. But kids<br/>\nbeing taught to read aren&#39;t choosing to read for meaning, they are doing<br/>\nlessons on decoding written letters into sounds. It isn&#39;t that surprising<br/>\nthat they just do that, one word at a time and each word a separate task.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are reading instruction methods that purposely do not use letter<br/>\ncombinations with real meaning - they don&#39;t use real words while the kids<br/>\nare learning to sound out. So the kids learn to &quot;read&quot; with lists like<br/>\nthis: dat, caf, eld, fol, lum, stug, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Farsi (Persian), they don&#39;t have these two different kinds of reading -<br/>\ndecoding versus reading for meaning because they don&#39;t put the vowel sounds<br/>\nin words (the vowel sounds don&#39;t have corresponding letters) so you have to<br/>\nknow the meaning of the sentence to know what word is meant.

When I was your daughter&#39;s<br/>\nage, I realized that one reason I always read several novels at once is<br/>\nbecause I typically feel sad when I read the last sentence. If I&#39;m at<br/>\ndifferent places in several works, the sadness of finishing one of them<br/>\nisn&#39;t so hard to bear.

I get great pleasure from the rhythm and poetry of beautiful<br/>\nprose, and I therefore sometimes reread passages and chapters over and over<br/>\nagain. I sometimes read my favorite passages aloud to increase this<br/>\npleasure, or at least I &quot;hear&quot; the words in my head as I read. As a child,<br/>\nI sometimes acted out parts in my favorite novels, as if I were engaging<br/>\nwith a script for a play. As an adult, I often mull over how I would turn a<br/>\nshort story or novel into a screenplay. For all the reasons stated above, I<br/>\ntend to read slowly. My point in saying all this is that &quot;comprehension&quot;<br/>\nisn&#39;t the only purpose for reading. There is also reading for pure pleasure<br/>\nof language or story.

Can she be reading for pure enjoyment and reading several books  at once is making her happy?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am one of those who reads several things at once, plus audio books!<br/>\nI can watch a show and be on the computer with someone talking or surfing. It kind of drives my husband a little crazy but that is how I am. People are different. They like different things. There is not wrong or right way to read a book.<br/>\n There is not minimum or maximum number of books one can read at the same time at any age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;professional unschoolers&quot; really bothers me. There are a few people that probably would be happy to be consired &quot;professionals&quot; unschoolers because they sell advice and support.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] reading several different books at once","postDate":"1338502124","msgId":67422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR2MXRkRFpUNlMxdENfZmJxaTZRYXU3RWpPZGNpdXVkaHVuaUF1VEVOSHd5Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxOG5wZytucDlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxOG5wZytucDlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67421,"nextInTopic":67423,"prevInTime":67421,"nextInTime":67423,"topicId":67419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I, personally, always found it tortuous to be forced to read one book at a time.

What if you didn&#39;t learn anything from a book?<br/>\nWhat if you read a book you&#39;ve read before and you  just enjoy reading.  I read Slapstick several times (Kurt Vonnegut).  I read Oliver Twist repeatedly when I was young, but I could hardly name any of the characters, then or now.  I&#39;ve read a book called Conceptual Blockbusting three or four times.    Sometimes I&#39;ve just read part of it, which is why I can&#39;t really count.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it takes maturity to learn from something interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But with a 9 year old jumping around like this! I thought I&#39;d ask all you &#39;professional&#39; unschoolers and see what you think!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I know for an unwavering fact is that if you were to do ANYthing to discourage her from reading the way she wants to, you would be discouraging her from reading.  You would be damaging her self-esteem, her creativity, and your relationship with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you look at a painting, whether you look at it and then another painting in the same gallery, and then come back to it, does it matter?  How much do you expect to retain or to learn from looking at a painting?  How about music?  There were people who could transcribe music so well and so fast, before recording devices were invented, that they would to to a concert or a show (Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan is one I know specifically about) and they could write down the tunes in musical notation, take them to people who could typeset them, and would sell bootleg music before it was officially published.  It was like bootleg Chinese movies-to=DVD, nowadays, only it took way more knowledge and effort than just holding a digital camera during a movie screening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo IF a guy could steal the music from a musical as it unfolded, was he &quot;actually learning&quot; from it?  Was he retaining what he had heard?  I don&#39;t think he was enjoying the show at all, or paying any attention to the costumes or staging or dialog between songs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe might have had &quot;more maturity&quot; in the music-transcription area than other people, but he had LESS maturity in the realm of integrity than those who could attend the show without stealing the intellectual property of the authors.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My 9 year old daughter loves to read.
