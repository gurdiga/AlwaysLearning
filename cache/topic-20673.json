After thinking about it, I feel more ready to try something <br/>\ndifferent (than nothing) the next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that has been meaningful to me has been trying to connect with <br/>\nmothers who are in that harried, scared(?), frustrated, overwhelmed state by <br/>\noffering empathy and assistance.  I try to connecting with the mother&#39;s frustration <br/>\nand then the children&#39;s experience.  I try to offer assistance and be <br/>\nfriendly to the mother and child.  Sometimes I simply interrupt the anger and ask for <br/>\nthe time, directions, or whatever and then strike up a conversation to <br/>\nhopefully turn things around.  Sometimes, I throw in a comment like &#39;spanking <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help anything in the long run but sometimes it can be hard to think of <br/>\nsomething else when we feel so frustrated!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found exchanges like this to be meaningful to my children, too, in <br/>\nthat they are aware of the compassionate response.  That&#39;s impt to me bec. I <br/>\noften resort to judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the situation you described is different than what Sandra <br/>\ndescribed.  I think I more easily connect with the &#39;harried/frustrated&#39;.  I&#39;ll have <br/>\nto look at that more for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, aside from the debate about spanking, I believe that &#39;hurt people <br/>\nhurt people&quot; so when someone wants to hurt another, it speaks to their own <br/>\nissues.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20666,"nextTopicId":20674}}
