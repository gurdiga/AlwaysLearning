I had gone to see a friend from high school (we were<br/>\nboth living in LA at the time) play with his band at the Troubador<br/>\n(sp?). My friend was a drummer and Gene Simmons was his absolute idol.<br/>\n Simmons happened to be there scouting talent and my friend couldn&#39;t<br/>\nresist going up to him at the bar to tell him so.  I was just standing<br/>\nthere and Mr. Simmons shook his hand while my friend gushed about how<br/>\nhe had influenced every part of his life etc etc.  It was so loud that<br/>\nhis words were drowned out and Simmons leaned in and asked him who his<br/>\nfriend (me) was. So Jason introduced me and told him I was turning 21<br/>\nat midnight.  Simmons looked at his watch and it was midnight and he<br/>\nleaned in and said &quot;Happy Birthday! Please allow me the honor of<br/>\nbuying you your first legal beer&quot; I said sure and we drank together<br/>\nand pretended to have a conversation - very animated, just moving our<br/>\nmouths and gesturing, because it was so incredibly loud! It was fun.<br/>\nHe was very nice and funny and very polite.  Then someone came and<br/>\nushered him away.
