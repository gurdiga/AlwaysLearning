That can&#39;t help but happen to some extent, but it&#39;s good to<br/>\nknow when it&#39;s happening and feel ourselves being aware of when we&#39;re<br/>\naccepting our children&#39;s growth and when we&#39;re trying to build<br/>\nnew-improved Mini-Me&#39;s. &gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis gave me some food for thought and left me pondering for an entire<br/>\nday - about parents wanting to live vicariously through our children<br/>\nand wanting a life path we didn&#39;t have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might remember, we have an 18mo son (Talon) and unschoolig is new<br/>\nto us.  It&#39;s become my obsession, and my SO (Terry) has agreed to<br/>\nfollow my lead.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when we are discussing Talon&#39;s learning, Terry will<br/>\npassionately mention the things he thinks are important for Talon to<br/>\nlearn (history), be involved in (sports), and do for the sake of<br/>\neducation (go to college).  These are all things important to Terry<br/>\nhimself.  History and sports are his passions, and the college thing<br/>\nis something he wishes he would have done right out of high school. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Terry mentions these things, I will return comment something like<br/>\n&quot;if Talon wants to&quot;, and at least once I went into my own rant about<br/>\nhow  terrible I think it is for parents to expect certain things and<br/>\nshape their children&#39;s lives just so the parent can live vicariously<br/>\nthrough them, and I pointed out that that&#39;s what Terry&#39;s ideas pointed<br/>\nto.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do actually feel this way, but the strong emotion I had attached to<br/>\nthat sentiment set off red flags for me.  I have learned in recent<br/>\nyears through my pursuit of personal growth (which I now understand to<br/>\nhave just been deschooling myself) that the things we judge or<br/>\ncriticize harshly in other people are in fact really just reflections<br/>\nof something unsettling within ourselves.  (It&#39;s not the judgment or<br/>\ncriticism itself, but our strong attachment to that judgment.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing this, I then look at myself and ask &quot;what am I doing?&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>\nmade me wonder if I&#39;m doing no different than Terry, but with my<br/>\ndesires for Talon to be unschooled.  I was the child fighting for<br/>\nrespect and independence for as far back as my memory will take me. <br/>\nI&#39;m the one who thinks how awesome it would have been to be unschooled<br/>\nmyself and parented respectfully, etc., etc.  Am I not doing the same<br/>\nthing and trying to live vicariously through our son also?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s what I was thinking about today - all day.  I didn&#39;t have an<br/>\nepiphany or come up with anything profound.  But when I came back<br/>\ntonight and re-read Sandra&#39;s comment that it&#39;s just good to be aware,<br/>\nthen maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s I needed to learn or hear for myself.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsure this will become clearer as Talon gets older.  He&#39;s already shown<br/>\nsigns of inheriting my independent streak, so perhaps he will have a<br/>\nfew things to show me about what that trait is really all about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211875477,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;amylizkid1@...&gt;","profile":"amylizkid1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Combining the best of both?

My daughter was at the top of the class from the <br/>\nbeginning and throughout 12 years of schooling and there&#39;s no doubt <br/>\nshe enjoyed the rewards that went with that. If ever she&#39;d asked to <br/>\nbe taken out of school, I&#39;m sure my wife and I would have taken the <br/>\nrequest seriously, but she never did. She liked school.

Out <br/>\nof school, my daughter did whatever she liked, the same as she had <br/>\ndone before she started school and the same as her brother does all <br/>\nthe time now.

Every other child I&#39;d ever <br/>\nknown, myself included, had to be cajoled into doing homework. Every <br/>\nnow and then, my daughter would decide she didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>\nschool that day and my wife and I would say, &quot;Sure, take the day <br/>\noff.&quot; And the next day when I was writing the note for her teacher, <br/>\nI&#39;d say, &quot;What do think, Bronwyn? Tummy upset? Sore throat?&quot; and <br/>\nshe&#39;d decide what I would write and we&#39;d both have a chuckle over <br/>\nthat. I&#39;d have much preferred to have been honest and written that my <br/>\ndaughter had been working very hard and decided to have an extra rest <br/>\nday to keep her mind fresh, but schools do seem to prefer their silly <br/>\ngame. And, really, I quite enjoyed cheating at it. Much as my <br/>\ndaughter went to &#39;good schools&#39; and I genuinely respected many of her <br/>\nteachers, I was never one for leaving what I wanted for my daughter <br/>\nat the school gate. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading a few days ago about a workshop one of the <br/>\ntop &#39;parenting experts&#39; here in Australia is promoting: it&#39;s for <br/>\nteachers - How to deal with difficult parents. And I thought to <br/>\nmyself, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d like to see you deal with ME, mate.&quot; LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I know, all nothing to do with unschooling.

She already has a BA <br/>\nthat she completed two years ago. Since August, she&#39;s been in <br/>\ntraining as a Scene of Crime Officer, a career job with a starting <br/>\nsalary that&#39;s almost twice the national average income.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 12 year old son who went to school for two years, hated <br/>\nit and asked to be taken out. He has now been out of school for more <br/>\nthan five years and in all his time at home with me has mostly <br/>\nplayed videogames, watched TV and surfed the internet. We have <br/>\nconversations every day about a wide range of &#39;real world&#39; subjects. <br/>\nWhat I hear from my son the most is &quot;I know that already&quot;. And he <br/>\ndoes know it. Without being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s up to me, my son will never see the inside of a school <br/>\nclassroom again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the advent of the internet and the Digital Revolution generally, <br/>\ninstitutional classroom based education is being rapidly superseded <br/>\nby more efficient methods of education that are readily available to <br/>\nanybody and everybody who wants to take advantage of them. Including <br/>\nchildren. In this day and age, and especially since 2005 when the <br/>\ninternet blossomed into full on multi-media, if you&#39;re connected to <br/>\nGoogle and you can&#39;t educate yourself, you&#39;d have to want to not be <br/>\neducated. Schools generally, in the face of this reality, are <br/>\nbecoming less and less about education and more and more about <br/>\ncovering their asses by continually lowering standards in order to <br/>\nkeep their &#39;academic numbers&#39; looking good and about keeping teachers <br/>\nin jobs. I feel sorry for the poor sods - i.e. the students who <br/>\nattend these glorified child minding centres - who are expected to <br/>\ncarry the can. I was reading an article about the supposed &#39;school of <br/>\nthe future&#39; the other day and there was a picture of children seated <br/>\nat rows of desks each with an open laptop in front of them. Who are <br/>\nthese people kidding? Not me. When I went to school in the 1950s, <br/>\nthere was no doubt that it was most parents&#39; best option if they <br/>\nwanted their children to get a &#39;good education&#39; and if there was crap <br/>\nthat went with that, and there was, you were expected to accommodate <br/>\nit as best you could - and that was in the days when most children <br/>\nhad at least one parent at home all day, but how many of them would <br/>\nbe willing to attempt something virtually everybody knew a school <br/>\nteacher could do better? Now those days are gone and they&#39;re not <br/>\ncoming back. And outdated and no longer useful beliefs are going with <br/>\nthem. By the time my son has a child of &#39;school age&#39; (if he does), <br/>\nthe idea of sending him or her to an institution to sit in a <br/>\nclassroom and be taught by somebody with no more capability than he <br/>\nhas (and if many schools&#39; resistence to digital tachnology is <br/>\nanything to go by, far less capability) will be like, &quot;What are you? <br/>\nAmish or something?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond reason. The view from where I&#39;m standing tells me there&#39;s big <br/>\nmoney to be made in online education. &quot;Webucation&quot; as management guru <br/>\nPeter Drucker calls it. The real education revolution is going on <br/>\nbehind the backs of the &#39;keepers of the school system&#39; as more and <br/>\nmore companies come into the distance and online learning market. <br/>\nAnd, since many of these companies are already experienced providers <br/>\nof educational resources and services to *adults*, they know that <br/>\neducational efficiency is the name of the game. No fluff and filler <br/>\nlike morning assembly, no waiting for slowcoaches to catch up, no <br/>\nstrangers deciding what you should or shouldn&#39;t be interested in, no <br/>\nobtaining knowledge in little bits at somebody else&#39;s whim, no <br/>\nputting your hand up to get permission to go to the toilet instead of <br/>\njust going when you need to, no eating by the clock instead of when <br/>\nyou&#39;re hungry, all those incidental things you get in a school <br/>\nclassroom that intelligent adults would feel insulted by but which <br/>\nmost teachers think is okay to impose on children. Now you can just <br/>\nGet Educated without all the crap. And it costs less too. My wife and <br/>\nI have saved a small fortune since our son&#39;s been at home and we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to pay school fees and for uniforms and supplies. The <br/>\nschool my son went to was always after money for something or other, <br/>\nmuch of it irrelevant to a &#39;good education&#39;. As private enterprise <br/>\ntakes over online education and more and more bricks and mortar <br/>\neducational institutions put more and more of their opportunities <br/>\nonline, as they&#39;re starting to do, it&#39;s only a matter of time before <br/>\nobtaining academic qualifications will be something anybody who wants <br/>\nto have them can do from more or less the comfort of their own home. <br/>\nMy wife completed her MBA in 1996 through the Open University while <br/>\nmaintaining a full-time career job. Imagine how much easier getting a <br/>\nuniversity degree will be for unschoolers who want to do that when <br/>\nthey have all day free to study. Thanks to the Digital Revolution, <br/>\nwe&#39;ve entered a Golden Age of self-education unprecedented in human <br/>\nhistory. The &#39;keepers of the school system&#39; are mostly in denial or <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to change old habits, but I, for one, am very, very <br/>\npleased that my son has the opportunity to get an education in the <br/>\nsame way that any intelligent *adult* would get an education.

PBL seems to be the new vogue teaching technique. Don&#39;t know if it works better, but it works much the same. He has to make sure that the students achieve the right points, it the right learning notes if you will. It is a curriculum, it is just under a different guise. Anyhow, I don&#39;t know if unschooling makes one more or less prepared for PBL or not. What unschooling does is help someone be better able to feel that learning happens whatever, and maybe, just maybe, formal education might be a good way to go to learn more about what you are interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note University education in the U.S. is nothing, really only a little bit, like University education in the UK. David says it is like some combined honours programs, but not really. As an American formally educated within the U.S. and only looking over the shoulder of my husband as he works within the U.K. higher education system, I prefer the U.S. system by a long way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be missed opportunities. We left Albuquerque for the UK just before the newest unschooling group there really got going. If we&#39;d stayed, man, well, we didn&#39;t... Just because you missed an opportunity doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t going to have other opportunities come along, or that you aren&#39;t going to be capable of making new opportunities for yourself. I think that is where unschooling really shines, it lets an individual, a child, know themselves better than they would know themselves if they were told what to do and when to do it and how to think. I think that if you know yourself and your abilities and ways to negotiate through your limititations, you will make enough opportunities for yourself that the missed ones won&#39;t effect you so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: rachel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rachel.prosser@...\">rachel.prosser@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 22 January, 2008 11:27:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Combining the best of both?

Having to  <br/>\ngo to school, buying into the concept that what is presented there is  <br/>\nmore important than the way you&#39;d prefer to spend your time, that  <br/>\nmommy has more important things to do each day than spend time with  <br/>\nyou which is why the child needs sent off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last sounds *really* harsh, but no matter how much a parent  <br/>\nwants the child to believe the child&#39;s needs are important, when  <br/>\nwe&#39;re putting the child&#39;s needs behind something else (work,  <br/>\nshopping, cooking) our actions are saying the total opposite. So the  <br/>\nchild can&#39;t help but internalize the message that they aren&#39;t as  <br/>\nimportant as work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there ways to minimize the effects of school? I think my  <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s friends parents have done a great job of staying connected  <br/>\nwith their schooled daughter and encouraging her interests. (The mom  <br/>\nwould have been a great unschooler.) They spend a lot of hours doing  <br/>\nthings together as a family, supporting her. But I *still* see the  <br/>\ndamage school has done to her. She thinks she&#39;s fat. She acts as if  <br/>\nher parents are jerks when she&#39;s around her friends. She stresses  <br/>\nover school work. School eats up huge hours of her day, not just in  <br/>\nthe classroom but homework and for what? Kids either have to buy into  <br/>\nthe idea that all that work is important or otherwise they&#39;re wasting  <br/>\na huge chunk of their life. Some kids *don&#39;t* buy into it and see the  <br/>\nbogusness of school and they&#39;re miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing trapped in any situation is just not healthy for happiness.
