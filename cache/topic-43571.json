That gives you something tangible to grab and read.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks - there are a number of good ones, depending on your purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a book - a collection of essays. They are great for really <br/>\n&quot;getting&quot; the underlying why&#39;s and how&#39;s of unschooling. Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>\nbook is especially good if your interest is in how unschooling <br/>\nprinciples apply to everything in life. If you&#39;re still trying to get <br/>\nout of the school mentality, then the first half of Grace Llewelyn&#39;s <br/>\nbook is wonderful (Te Teenage Liberation Handbook) or even John Gatto&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;Dumbing us Down.&quot; These will help you remember why you don&#39;t want to do <br/>\nschool. Frank Smith&#39;s, &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting,&quot; has had a <br/>\nhuge influence on many of us; it isn&#39;t about unschooling, although most <br/>\nunschoolers who read it immediately feel that unschooling is the only <br/>\nthing that makes sense in the light of what he tells us about how <br/>\nlearning happens.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel like I<br/>\n&gt;   am literally jumping off a cliff without a parachute. This journey is exhilarating but scary at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll find your wings.

I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as &quot;un-learning.&quot; <br/>\nYou&#39;re learning &quot;more&quot; - not unlearning. Other people&#39;s writing will <br/>\ninspire and inform you - but you&#39;ll learn the most from your own kids. <br/>\nWatch them more carefully. Try to think like them. Try to create joy and <br/>\ncomfort and security and lots of interesting swirling experience around <br/>\nthem.
