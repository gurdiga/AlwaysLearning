But time is always an issue with<br/>\nhomeschoolers who are busy with their kids.  I&#39;m happy to do a live<br/>\ninterview with anyone who might want to do it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve set this up to be simple and easy and it focuses on three main<br/>\npoints: freedom, flexibility and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can easily see what I&#39;m doing by just going to the blog<br/>\n(http://www.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to shorten my message earlier, but here are the questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n1. How long have you been homeschooling (or if finished, how long did<br/>\nyou homeschool)?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. One of the main benefits of homeschooling is the freedom and<br/>\nflexibility it allows. Can you give us a few examples of how this<br/>\nfreedom and flexibility benefited you (your family)?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Another benefit of homeschooling is the fun factor. Can you give us a<br/>\nfew examples of some especially fun times you had as a result of<br/>\nhomeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. We all have funny experiences while homeschooling. Can you share one<br/>\nof yours with us?<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have been having a great time with it.  I think it&#39;s great to<br/>\ninclude the kids of course and some families have chosen to do that.<br/>\nSome people send in a picture of an activity they might have done or<br/>\njust a fun family picture.  If anyone has a blog or website they want me<br/>\nto link to, I&#39;m happy to do that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you have any other questions and I hope to see some<br/>\nresponses soon!

So thanks, I really appreciate the feedback from<br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I have an invitation to all of you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a project I am doing for my homeschooling freedom blog<br/>\n(http://www.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com) and would love to have<br/>\nanyone on this list participate.  I named it &#39;homeschoolingisfreedom&#39;<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s a main focus for me as to why homeschooling works and my<br/>\ngoal is to create a place where anyone who is interested can read short<br/>\ninterviews of lots of homeschooling families answering the questions<br/>\nbelow. I think it could help people understand the benefits of the<br/>\nfreedom and why it&#39;s so necessary to successful homeschooling.  Perhaps<br/>\nit could even be useful if we ever get into a situation where the<br/>\ngovernment wants to add regulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least, I think it could be a great ongoing document, a<br/>\ndatabase if you will, demonstrating how individual families make<br/>\npositive use of the freedom and flexibility unregulated homeschooling<br/>\nallows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to interview your families.  If you are interested, please<br/>\nsend me an email to:<br/>\nDebbie@...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of you will be a part of this project. I promise it will be<br/>\nfun!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much,<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie Harbeson<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43265,"nextTopicId":43272}}
