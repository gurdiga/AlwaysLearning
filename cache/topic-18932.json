But there wer still many decades of <br/>\noverlap.  My grandmother&#39;s family moved to and from a ranch near Carizozo, New <br/>\nMexico, without trucks.  Covered wagon, herding cattle, riding horses.  There <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a road a truck could&#39;ve gone on anyway.

Trust is about love.<br/>\nI wish I had known that from the beginning.<br/>\nI spent the first half of my son Sam&#39;s life being a controlling <br/>\nparent.  Worrying about him turning out right and making so many <br/>\ndecisions based on fear.  I spent the last half of his life learning <br/>\nto let go, to value who he IS, not who he will be.

Seven weeks and already looking ahead to college, are you?  <br/>\n <br/>\nYou are going to find that so many of our best plans with our kids seldom turn out as we planned.  This is because, when we just love our kids, let them unfold on their own and come to know who they are, what we get is so much more and better than we could have ever thought to plan or even ask for!  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen you have loved your children, and raised thim in freedom, cherishing their journey -- and yours -- they will know what they want from life, and how to pursue it, whether or not they ever spent a moment in a classroom.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, by the time a person goes to college, even the most unschooled have likely attended Driver&#39;s Ed, tried some art or dance classes, or learned a sport that involved focused attention to a teacher, practice and some level of discipline as well as a time commitment.  And they&#39;ll have done it because this was what they wanted to do, it was the path they chose to reach their own goals, for their own fulfillment.  College really only works for people who want to be there.  I&#39;ve known lots of people who either didn&#39;t finish college because they were only going for someone else (myself included) or finished, but never pursued the career choice, again because going didn&#39;t fulfill them, it simply fulfilled someone else&#39;s plan for them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor now, just relax with your new baby.  Respond to his needs with love, watch him with amazement, sniff his head (better than any other sensory experience I&#39;ve ever had) laugh with him, watch him become who he is meant to be.  That&#39;s how unschooling works, and nothing that right can ever be insufficient for your child&#39;s future.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
