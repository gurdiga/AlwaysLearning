Her children are only  <br/>\nallowed to watch tv when they are sick.<br/>\nRecently, her 8 yr old said he felt ill at school, and the nurse  <br/>\ncalled my friend to come get him. When they got home, he expected  <br/>\nthat he was going to get to watch tv, but my friend said there are  <br/>\nlots of reasons stomachs feel sick, and one of them is when you want  <br/>\nto avoid doing something like school, so until he actually threw up,  <br/>\nno tv. A few hours later, he did throw up. She told me she thinks he  <br/>\nforced himself to do it so he could watch tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, not only is it entirely possible that he is forcing himself to  <br/>\nthrow up, just to watch some tv, the other byproduct of this whole  <br/>\nthing, is that he is no longer just allowed to even be sick. He has  <br/>\nto prove it. She suspects that whenever he says he is sick, he is  <br/>\nfaking to get tv. There is no trust between them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also mention that at least one of her other two kids and  <br/>\nherself had actually been sick within the last few days, so its  <br/>\nentirely probable that he WAS sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nblogging at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42396,"nextTopicId":42295}}
