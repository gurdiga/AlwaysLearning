It could be a party if we wanted, but more often it was an outing of our choosing that we all would participate in (a hike, apple picking, trip to a museum, favorite restaurant...) and would include some fun extras, like a stop at a favorite bakery on the way or at a great look out point off the road.  If we wanted to, we could invite a friend or two. This special day could happen any time near the birthday day -- it needn&#39;t fall of the day itself, which made scheduling easier.  On our actual birthday day, we could choose our favorite meal for dinner and would open family presents.

Because we&#39;re hoping our  <br/>\nchildren grow up and become adults and parents (unlike those bar- <br/>\npressing trained rats, which moved on to some other lab after the  <br/>\npsych 102 students had circussed them up some), creating issues about  <br/>\nfood is a Bad Idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of what people call &quot;bribery&quot; is absolutely normal and sensible  <br/>\nbehavior.  If I want Marty to drive me somewhere because my leg is  <br/>\nhurt, I&#39;ll offer to take him to lunch, or to make a dinner he  <br/>\nespecially likes.

I needed to keep the kids interested in staying at the table to do all their worksheets, so I purposefully told them to stay in their pjs, gave them a drink, and made up silly names for myself as their teacher.  I&#39;d adopt another persona so they didn&#39;t see me as &#39;mom&#39; but rather as &#39;teacher&#39;.  I wouldn&#39;t let them eat during school-time because it was too distracting.  Instead, I used food as a reward for completing their work.  I felt it was so different from traditional school and thought it was great homeschooling. Schools use gold stars, stickers, recess, and all kinds of little rewards for good behavior.  I wish I had made that connection at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBribery is thought of as bad.

Inviting a few friends that we know is possible but i am afraid they might not come and William might be desappointed because they live quite far. I also am afraid to ask them as they are without car for most of them.<br/>\nMy concern is that i want to make a beautiful house, decor, cake and mini fête or even a party, but the date is coming and I am not sure to get everything done; while nursing William and his sister Julia and I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.<br/>\nIf other families could share their expertise with me it would be great :-))<br/>\nAnne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\nDate: Fri, 23 Oct 2009 08:30:41 -0600<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] monkey platters and school at home<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  -=-I have a friend who&#39;s a child therapist, and she occasionally implies<br/>\n<br/>\nthat I&#39;m &quot;repressed&quot; because I don&#39;t shout at my children or create a  <br/>\n<br/>\nlot of<br/>\n<br/>\ndrama.

The police were there a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were evicted.  Not the grandparent owners, but finally after many  <br/>\n<br/>\nyears the rest of them were scattered and told they couldn&#39;t live  <br/>\n<br/>\nthere.  A daughter came, the sister of the man who was there before.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe talked to Holly, was very apologetic about her awful other  <br/>\n<br/>\nrelatives, and told Holly to feel free to call the police if she ever  <br/>\n<br/>\nsaw any of the nephews/cousins/others from the last batch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe house is way cleaner, they planted some garden, they cleaned out  <br/>\n<br/>\nthe swimming pool which had become kind of a dump and rat den.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve had garage sales and moved a junker car away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe yells.

Because of your easily accessible webpage her children are getting in less trouble with their mom. That&#39;s a good thing. Because of a tool you made available, the mom is looking to solutions outside of shouting and time outs and contracts, or at least so many contracts, for any behavioural problems she may feel her daughters are exhibiting.
