Sandra,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1674316733\">Most of my kids are over at a friends house having fun, so I&#39;m just clicking on link after <br/>\nlink reading online (following the train of thought, right?) Sandra, your website is really a <br/>\ntreasure chest, I feel excited to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just wanted to say that I did enjoy the disposable checklists page, very helpful for <br/>\na new unschooler like me :-)  It actually sounds a lot like what we started doing. I do write <br/>\ndown at the end of each week what we&#39;ve been doing, in case the state ever decides to <br/>\ninvestigate. I doubt it will happen, because we live in a very liberal homeschooling state <br/>\nanyway, but because we have such &#39;radical&#39; parenting styles as well as a child with a <br/>\ndisability, I&#39;m not taking anything for granted. The page about terminology affecting <br/>\nthought was right on the money there, it reminds me of the &#39;people first&#39; language. The <br/>\ngoal is for us to see people before the disability, and here the goal is to learn, not teach, <br/>\nright?<br/>\n<br/>\nand I was reading the story of a day in the life of unschooling by Julie, and wanted to say <br/>\nhow much I enjoyed reading it. It sounds so much like me...we started last July with a very <br/>\nregimented schedule, lots of expectations for what would be learned each day, down to <br/>\nthe minute. We had written schedules a la supernanny (seriously, on a huge poster), as <br/>\nwell as a chore chart that could astound any master of organization. Now I just laugh. My <br/>\nhusband is confused because he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on anymore (I just told him <br/>\n&quot;welcome to my life! And don&#39;t expect anything&quot;) Instead of having assigned chores, I <br/>\nrecycled that page and made a list of &quot;jobs that help our family&quot;. The kids, when bored, <br/>\nwill look at it and see if any thing sounds like fun (their words!) Granted there will be days <br/>\nin a row where they don&#39;t do anything, but if I ask for help, they cheerfully join in. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally think it would ever work, considering how much I resented doing housework as a kid <br/>\n(and TBH, sometimes now) <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this has been another train of thought (choo-choo) by a mom who is giddy from lack <br/>\nof sleep, and doubly giddy by the lack of children right now. I even typed diggy instead of <br/>\ngiddy the first few times I typed this sentence. Hopefully someday Avari will sleep longer <br/>\nthan two hours at a time. But I&#39;m not thinking it&#39;ll happen in the next few months :-)  I&#39;m <br/>\nthe kind of person to believe that every thing happens for a reason. I couldn&#39;t see it with <br/>\nthe terrible pregnancy at first. I lost two pregnancies back to back, and moved straight <br/>\ninto the worst pregnancy I&#39;ve ever seen, morning sickness from conception straight <br/>\nthrough labor, early contractions followed by going two weeks overdue. I thought surely I <br/>\nwas being punished for a previous life choice! But without it I never would have been able <br/>\nto relax the homeschooling enough to even consider unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;m lost again on yet a different train. Hope everyone is enjoying the day, it&#39;s <br/>\nbeautiful here in Oklahoma, nearly 60 degrees, sunny and dry outside. Josh is camping <br/>\nwith daddy at Greenleaf state park with a few other of his scout friends, and we&#39;re heading <br/>\nto our local lake for a hike. Wish me luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nmelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23554,"nextTopicId":23538}}
