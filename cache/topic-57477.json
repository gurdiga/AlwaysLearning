Not all  are continuing today and not all are online.  New forums start from time to time, and I hope they continue.  I myself was introduced to concepts of  learning and parenting by one such online forum years ago, and there I found that these issues of personal family life as well as  social issues and connecting with the communities that have  traditionally practiced what we now call unschooling, were prominent and very much connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was, that in my &quot;enthusiasm&quot; as you so charmingly put it, I posted according to my own understanding and practice of unschooling in my family and in my learning community  (some of whom came over for dinner last week - incl from a family, who was the first example of unschooling  I had ever met, 12 years ago in Gujarat, and whose sons were now grown.

I face a block here<br/>\n&gt; since even though in my younger days I have been a journalist and<br/>\n&gt; reported against all things wrong with the world in general.
