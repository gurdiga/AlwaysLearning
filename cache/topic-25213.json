Here is a situation that happened this morning at our house.  It was a busy time, breakfast happening and my husband going off to work early.  (I have a 9yo, a 7yo, a 2 yo, and a 5 mo).....the 2 yo asked for oatmeal, which she likes to share with her Dad.  She then spotted a bowl of jelly beans on the counter that were left over from yesterday and climbed up on a chair to get them.  As she reached for them, Dad said, &quot;Those aren&#39;t really a breakfast food.&quot;  I said, &quot;It&#39;s OK, Honey&quot; to my husband and she proceeded to have a few jelly beans and brought about 4 more over to her high chair.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her.  She happily sat with oatmeal, pineapple, oj, and jelly beans on her tray.  As she was eating, I said something like &quot;You know, when I eat candy and my tummy is empty, it sometimes feels yucky.&quot;  My 7 yo said he agreed and told me about a time he had eaten chocolate when<br/>\n he was really hungry.  I guess my question is, was it worth talking about the principle right then?  I felt like I was really doing it more for the 7 yo and 9 yo....should I have said nothing and saved the conversation about being healthy and taking care of our bodies for another time?  Not really sure how this should have played out......<br/>\n  Thanks for reading and offering suggestions.  I apprecuate all of the years of wisdom here.....<br/>\n  Peace, <br/>\n  Beth <br/>\n  NB:  The four or so jelly beans on her tray got chewed and spit out! <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLove cheap thrills?
