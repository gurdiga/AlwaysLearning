So the 10 yo gets <br/>\n$10 per month and the 14 yo gets $14 per month. HOWEVER - we made a drastic <br/>\nincrease in the amount when my oldest daughter started getting interested in <br/>\nclothes and long-distance phone calls and buying lots of gifts for friends, <br/>\netc. When I noticed that we were butting heads, over and over, whenever we <br/>\nwere out - that I was having to CONSTANTLY decide, on the spur of the moment, <br/>\nwhether to buy something for her, or not, we upped her monthly allowance to <br/>\n$50 a month and she is supposed to buy all her own clothes, accessories, <br/>\ngifts, and pay phone bills. We don&#39;t stick to it very well - I buy her <br/>\nclothes when I feel like it. But this way it is a sort of gift from us and <br/>\nshe never asks, she just assumes she is paying and is very grateful when I <br/>\nstep in and say, &quot;I&#39;ll pay for that for you.&quot; Now she is 17 and has a paying <br/>\njob and we still give her that money and still buy stuff for her when we feel <br/>\nlike it. She wants to spend her earned money on going to all THREE sessions <br/>\nof Not-Back-to-School Camp in the fall. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3082890,"authorName":"oldpriss","from":"&quot;oldpriss&quot; &lt;Priss1000@...&gt;","profile":"oldpriss","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: allowances","postDate":"1007992957","msgId":452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl2MmY5dCtkOTZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDExMjEwMDkxNjU2LjU0OTQ0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwOTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":446,"nextInTopic":474,"prevInTime":451,"nextInTime":453,"topicId":446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He <br/>\ngets $15 a week, but from the early days of his getting an allowance <br/>\nwe showed him how to budget it into different categories. The way it <br/>\nworks right now is he puts $6 a week into his spending bank, $5 a <br/>\nweek goes into savings, $2.50 a week goes into a piggy bank that&#39;s <br/>\nset aside for gifts for others, and $1.50 goes to charity (his choice <br/>\nof charities). He&#39;s happy with the system so far and frequently will <br/>\nput his spending money into one of the other categories. Recently <br/>\nhe&#39;s been trying to make sure he&#39;ll have enough for everyone&#39;s <br/>\nChristmas presents so he&#39;s shifted a good bit to that fund. Often <br/>\nhe&#39;s added to the charity bank. He has his own Quicken file on the <br/>\ncomputer with four accounts showing how much he has and where he <br/>\nspends his money. He seems to enjoy using Quicken.
