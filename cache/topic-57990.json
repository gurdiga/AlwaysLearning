They had a blast and learned a lot.  It is mostly run by college kids with some older adults in supervisory positions.  They went near us in Ann Arbor to University of Michigan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great camp is at Michigan Tech.  My middle son has been going to that camp for three years.  It&#39;s quite a drive up to Houghton from Ann Arbor, but well worth it.

I have been considering it for my son, once he’s interested/ready as well, although the 8:30 am start and full day with group games and other “campy” stuff wouldn’t appeal to him right now. I really wish they offered a half day, computer stuff only, program.  I hope to hear how she likes it if she ends up doing it!<br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Has anyone gone to iD Tech Camp?","postDate":"1288964750","msgId":57991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Nzg3NjBDLTZFNEQtNEM2OC04ODIwLTczRjI4RDUzRTEwNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGliMTFmMitqMTFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGliMTFmMitqMTFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57990,"nextInTopic":57993,"prevInTime":57990,"nextInTime":57992,"topicId":57990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, Kathryn took a couple of their classes and loved them.
