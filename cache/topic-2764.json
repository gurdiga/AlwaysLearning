Had a ball and Adriane did a good job<br/>\nshowing her goat.  We were able to talk until there was simply nothing left<br/>\nthat NEEDED to be said and we could just enjoy comfortable silence at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley--you shave a goat&#39;s butt because it is a dairy goat show and the<br/>\njudge has to get up close and personal to check out all the mammary system.<br/>\nThe goat is washed, shined and shaved from head to toe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut.....today I was snotty and hateful and so were the kids.  Stressed to<br/>\nthe gills and couldn&#39;t put my finger on why.  The kids and I just couldn&#39;t<br/>\nsee eye to eye on anything today.  Finally, after supper, we were able to<br/>\nfind a way to relax into each other and find some enjoyment together.<br/>\nThinking positive thoughts for a better tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2758,"nextTopicId":2766}}
