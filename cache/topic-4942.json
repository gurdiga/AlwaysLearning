The flickering lights of<br/>\nfarolitos<br/>\n   line the streets and sidewalks of homes<br/>\nand churches throughout the Land of<br/>\nEnchantment to celebrate the birth of the<br/>\n   Christ child. For me, the small paper<br/>\nlanterns symbolically welcome Baby Jesus into<br/>\nthe world, and into our hearts on this<br/>\n   most holy of all nights.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Farolitos is the Spanish word for little<br/>\nlanterns. In the sixteenth century, small<br/>\nbonfires called luminarias were burned<br/>\n   alongside the roads and churchyards to<br/>\ncommemorate Christs birth and to guide<br/>\npeople to Midnight Mass the final night of<br/>\n   Las Posadas.<br/>\n<br/>\n   By the early nineteenth century, US<br/>\nsettlers brought beautiful<br/>\n   Chinese lanterns to hang from their<br/>\ndoorways instead of building<br/>\n   bonfires. But the Chinese lanterns were<br/>\ntoo expensive so people<br/>\n   began to make small paper lanterns out of<br/>\npaper sacks as an<br/>\n   alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The night of Las Posadas (Spanish word<br/>\nmeaning lodging or inn) is a<br/>\n   festive celebration that was first<br/>\nintroduced to the Mexican Indians<br/>\n   by European missionaries by reenacting the<br/>\nstory of Mary and<br/>\n   Josephs search for lodging in Bethlehem<br/>\nin a series of nine<br/>\n   consecutive nights, beginning<br/>\n<br/>\n   December 16th. Each night a group of<br/>\ncarolers would go from house to house and<br/>\nsing a song in Spanish pleading for food<br/>\n   and shelter. Some homes would turn them<br/>\naway, but others would invite them in and<br/>\noffer posole, red and green chile<br/>\n   stews, Christmas Eve tamales, biscoshitos,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   These plays originally were conducted in<br/>\nthe churches but eventually moved into<br/>\npeoples homes. Now Las Posadas is<br/>\n   done in just one evening; Christmas Eve.<br/>\nAfter the festivities are complete, everyone<br/>\nthen goes to Christmas Mass, and<br/>\n   the luminarias and farolitos show the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Farolitos are easy to make and add beauty<br/>\nand tradition to your Christmas celebration.<br/>\nAll you need are: paper sacks,<br/>\n   sand, and votive candles. If the wind is<br/>\nblowing hard the night you put them out,<br/>\nplace a small brick or rocks inside the bag<br/>\n   to weight it down. Line the bags in a row<br/>\non the edges of your sidewalks and driveways.<br/>\n<br/>\n   A modern variation of these decorations<br/>\nare electric lights in bags and you can find<br/>\nthem<br/>\n   in many stores. However, personally I<br/>\nthink the homemade ones are the prettiest.<br/>\n   Albuquerques Old Town has farolitos lined<br/>\nall down its streets on Christmas Eve, as do<br/>\n   other towns like Santa Fe, Taos and Las<br/>\nCruces. They even have bus tours so that the<br/>\n   area isnt as congested with traffic.<br/>\n<br/>\n   You can of course get together with others<br/>\nin your community and set up your own<br/>\n   farolitos display in your neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n   There are ways to make your farolitos more<br/>\ndecorative. Stencil Christmas patterns onto<br/>\n   the front of your bags, and using an<br/>\nex-acto knife, cut out the patterns, then<br/>\ntape colored<br/>\n   crepe paper inside the bags.<br/>\n<br/>\n   A final note. People in Albuquerque tend<br/>\nto call the paper bag lanterns, luminarias,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n   natives from Santa Fe insist the correct<br/>\nterm is farolitos. As I mentioned earlier, a<br/>\ntrue<br/>\n   luminaria is a series of small bonfires<br/>\nlining the roads. Whatever you choose to call<br/>\nthem is up to you. But do think about<br/>\n   setting some out this Christmas and add a<br/>\nnew tradition to your holidays no matter<br/>\nwhere you live.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\nMom to Lexie (6) and Janene (3)<br/>\nFor great nursing clothes and slings, go to<br/>\nwww.4mommyandme.com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wasn&#39;t it Mark Twain who said it takes a<br/>\nvery dull person to spell a word only one<br/>\nway?&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4930,"nextTopicId":4858}}
