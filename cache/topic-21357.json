It was night so it was just at the edge of my low beams. It was a very light grey color.<br/>\nI was just  delighted.<br/>\nThey have been coming into our area more and more in the last 7-8 years. My adult boys have seen them as they are out  in the bush  more  and  others see them fairly often in  our sparsely populated  area.<br/>\nThere is a small &quot;wolf centre&quot;  a few miles away  where they  keep  a few in a big  wooded compound but after being there once i won&#39;t go again. If it isn&#39;t out in the wilderness I just feel badly.The people who run it are knowledgable and take  one or more to the schools etc and do talks for tourists there.<br/>\nYour son would enjoy it though.<br/>\nRight now I happen to be reading  Shadow Mountain&quot; by Renee Askins. She is a wildlife biologist who words on introducing wolves into Yellowstone Park (among other projects), A good read.<br/>\nWe  unschool  our twin ggd,s  in the  East Kootenays, of BC Canada. between Banff National Park and Yoho and glacier Nat. Park.<br/>\nHope your son gets to see a wolf in the wild someday-it is a rare privelage.<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\nthe girls love video games-main interests right now are Runescape , Animal Crossing , Harvest Moon, Mario Sunshine.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- If anyone is interested in wolves, we found an interesting site:<br/>\n  International Wolf Center  www.wolf.org very cool, it has 3 cameras that<br/>\n  they refresh every minute to see the wolves on the compound. We adopted one<br/>\n  of the older wolves, so our son is very excited about that. All I know about<br/>\n  the facility is what is on the website.<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.298 / Virus Database: 265.6.7 - Release Date: 12/30/04<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21355,"nextTopicId":21358}}
