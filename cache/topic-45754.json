Gradually I  <br/>\nrealized how wrong I was about so many things (hello! married to a  <br/>\nman! three children! best friend is a man! some of my favorite books  <br/>\nare by men! recently discovered the music of Del McCoury, who is a  <br/>\nman, and can&#39;t get enough! Stay-at-home mom, which is in some sense  <br/>\njust the new PC word for &quot;housewife&quot;!). I thought lesbians were the  <br/>\nhighest evolution of humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best friend (and lover for a long time) back then used to joke that  <br/>\nshe was going to have &quot;Dyke&quot; tattoo&#39;d on her arm, and if she ever  <br/>\ndecided she wasn&#39;t a lesbian anymore, she&#39;d just cut her arm off.<br/>\n<br/>\nHa ha ha ha.

Maybe we&#39;ll do it; maybe we won&#39;t. But  <br/>\nnot that long ago, we would have said, &quot;Our ideal vacation takes place  <br/>\nwithin three hours of home and lasts no more than 5 days.

How that works for me is that I try to remember that no matter  <br/>\nhow much I think I know about something or how strongly I feel about  <br/>\nit, I could very well be wrong. Or, more likely, there are  <br/>\nperspectives I haven&#39;t thought of or been exposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t give my kids my radical ideological version of things (not  <br/>\neven about unschooling!), and I stay open to the possibility that they  <br/>\nwill disagree with me about some things. I wouldn&#39;t give one of my  <br/>\nkids the &quot;that Barbie was made by an exploited child&quot; talk in part  <br/>\nbecause I have read a whole lot about globalization with the result  <br/>\nthat, while I am concerned about child labor and other labor abuses, I  <br/>\nam also mindful of the enormous benefits to many Chinese people from  <br/>\nthe liberalization of their economy.

Explaining things they don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t care about  <br/>\nor that seem crazy to them will sound like &quot;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne guy (who might have joined this list, which would be fine) wrote  <br/>\nthat he always knelt down to talk to his child so he wasn&#39;t talking  <br/>\ndown to her.    &quot;Talking down&quot; to someone has little to do with  <br/>\nrelative height.  Sometimes when people write about problems they&#39;re  <br/>\nhaving with their children and they tell the story, they&#39;ll use  <br/>\nphrases like &quot;mommy needs her rest&quot; or &quot;this is bothering  <br/>\nbrother.&quot;     Children will learn to speak properly sooner and more  <br/>\neasily if their mothers speak English as it was intended, too.    **It  <br/>\nbothers Sandra when other mommykins talk baby talk to their babas and  <br/>\nthen ask listowner how their babyses can learn to use their right  <br/>\nwords to mama.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWords have power, and sometimes it&#39;s the power to make life  <br/>\nirritating, and to make communication insipid.  It can make the child  <br/>\nthink the mom isn&#39;t very bright.  It sets a separation between the  <br/>\nthings you want the child to know are communicated toward him (the  <br/>\nbaby talk) and real world communications (when you start using  <br/>\npersonal pronouns and names).  Let the world be all one thing.  Let  <br/>\nyour children be a part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I wrote in the Barbie discussion, to Ren, was:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You have politely or tactfully said that a parent&#39;s judgment causes a  <br/>\nchild to doubt herself. In my life, my self confidence was strong, and  <br/>\nmy mother&#39;s judgment caused me to doubt her, and then resent her, and  <br/>\neventually to ignore her opinion entirely. That never did hurt me,  <br/>\nthough, nor her, because her mothering instinct was never switched on  <br/>\nwell at all, though she had three children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible, I know from my own experience, for a child to have  <br/>\nlittle regard for a parent&#39;s opinion.  Make your opinions valuable by  <br/>\nnot expressing worthless opinions.   Tadaa!  Easy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45831,"nextTopicId":45829}}
