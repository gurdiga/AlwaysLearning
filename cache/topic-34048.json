Last summer my kids, then 9 and 11, spent 3 weeks with my parents. I tried to have it only be a week, but my parents and the kids both insisted 3 weeks was a good time.  I was right. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has a &quot;cuddle shirt&quot; which is an old shirt of mine.  She has a few, which are very important to her.  Her favorite is now saved away, it was &quot;Mrs. Cuddie.&quot;  My mother took it away from her, and didn&#39;t even tell her.  Also, her favorite stuffed animal was taken from her.  All because my daughter didn&#39;t clean up to my parent&#39;s satisfaction.  So sad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is even worse, is that when they discuss the 3 1/2 weeks with my parents, the first things that come to mind is NOT the camping trips.  Not the long hikes in the woods.  Not how Alexx learned to drive on the back roads of NM.  Not the trips to the various historical sites in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona... It was how my parents limited Alexx&#39;s computer time to 1 hour a day, but my dad spent hours and hours on the computer.  Alexx learned to wake herself up at 1am after my parents went to bed, and would sneak on the computer until 4 am and then she&#39;d go back to sleep, and sleep late.  The hiding of the toys.  The food issues.  I guess it should serve to remind me what I want my children to remember about me and their childhood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when Alexx was in the body cast, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t even leave the bed to go to the potty herself, six weeks like this.  My mom and dad came out to help out for a few weeks.  My mom limited Alexx&#39;s tv.  She could watch 1 hour a day, unless it was a history or other &quot;educational&quot; program.  And she could play playstation for 1 hour a day.  period.  How stupid is that.  Both girls wish to go back to my parents this summer for a time.  They said  &quot;1 1/2 weeks this time, mom.&quot;  They want to fly back alone.  This could be worked out, but I am hesitant to send them again.  I really don&#39;t want to be away from my girls, and the stress of hearing them tell me these things on the phone was too much. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they are home alone, I tease them and tell them that I want to come home and find everyone still alive.  They are absolutely forbidden to kill each other.  It&#39;s kinda a family joke.  On Tuesday (April 1) I came home and Alexx was in the kitchen.  I called for Janene.  She didn&#39;t answer.  Alexx said &quot;she&#39;s on the bed, mom.&quot;  In a strange tone, she said this.  I walked back to her room and there was Janene.  Dead.  On the bed.  Shirt torn, blood coming out of her chest wound.  big grin on her face.  Alexx says &quot;sorry mom, I couldn&#39;t help it, I killed her.&quot;  Janene cracked up laughing.  It was one of the best April fools jokes. They had gone so far as to put a towel down on the bed under Janene so the blood (ketchup) didn&#39;t get on our sheets.  They had worked on this joke for a long time.  Together.  And I am very sure they were laughing and enjoying each other as they were planning this little spoof.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my girls are great.  I&#39;m so lucky to be their mother, and I love spending every minute I can with them.  Alexx is now 13, and she&#39;s amazing. So many people don&#39;t seem to like their teen, but I think mine is fantastic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n---- Sylvia Toyama &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sylgt04@...\">sylgt04@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Just two nights ago, my brother called me -- our first call in 18 <br/>\n&gt; months (huge falling out).

My mom and Grandma have NEVER gotten along.  Last year my 15 yo dd was copping an attitude and demanding one thing after another which I patiently tried to comply to because most of the stuff just wasn&#39;t a big deal (Mom, I want ice-cream from Winco, can you take me? at 11pm)  Anyway, my mom said &quot;My mom would&#39;ve never let me get away with stuff like that&quot; and I said (trying not to be too rude) &quot;How&#39;d that work out for you Mom?&quot;  Meaning, I want something different when my daughters are adults ... I want relationship.  It&#39;s hard because I want my parents to be pleased with me, so sometimes I vascillate...but I&#39;m trying so hard to go another direction....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing that impressed me one time was when I visited my friend and her graduated daughter.  Her daughter was speaking her mind about quite a bit of stuff and my friend just took it all in stride - I loved it and it was really inspirational because I would never think to be that forward with my Mom - too afraid - but they had the best relationship even though the daughter was clearly not pleased with the mom on a few issues and vice-versa.  It was real and authentic.
