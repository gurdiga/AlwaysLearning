I can&#39;t go back<br/>\nand change that. What I can do that is healing for me is to give my<br/>\nkids the childhood they deserve; the childhood every child deserves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s why I am the kind of Mom I am, why I strive to be always kinder,<br/>\nmore patient, more present, more loving. I want them to look back on<br/>\ntheir childhood with joy and good memories, to know they are loved<br/>\nand valuable, and always have been. Knowing what I know, and<br/>\nremembering my own childhood, I can&#39;t do things the mainstream way.<br/>\nI can&#39;t punish my kids, or limit their passions, or &#39;reward&#39; them<br/>\nonly for being &#39;good enough.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are good enough every moment, even when it&#39;s not easy in that<br/>\nmoment to be my child&#39;s Mom. Those are the moments that call me to<br/>\nbe the person I want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You Sylvia,<br/>\nThis above forced me out of lurkdom and I just had to reply.This is <br/>\nthe most touching message for me.I would love to print your words out <br/>\nand tape one copy to my refridgerator door and one copy to put under <br/>\nmy pillow at night to help me obsorb it.<br/>\nI totally screwed up parenting my children,but I have a second chance <br/>\nwith my grandchildren I am helping to raise.<br/>\nThank You,<br/>\nTricia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34058,"nextTopicId":34076}}
