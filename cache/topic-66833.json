So - make up for that by doing some super<br/>\nsuper cool things at least for the next things you insist on. Don&#39;t try to<br/>\nmake him go fishing at the lake because his DAD likes that. Think about the<br/>\nreal little boy you have there - not some imaginary kid who &quot;should&quot; like<br/>\n&quot;doing things and going places.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEntice him to go with you and your husband to something super fun AND take<br/>\na friend of his along. Make the outings so fun that he starts to change his<br/>\nattitude. Does he have a DS or something portable to play with in the car?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a friend - I know you said you don&#39;t always want to because YOU have<br/>\nthis idealized image of your family togetherness and it doesn&#39;t include his<br/>\nattention being on his friend and not you and his dad. I get that. But take<br/>\nthis one step at a time. If he goes with you and brings a friend and they<br/>\nhave a really good time - then you&#39;ve made some progress with finding out<br/>\nwhat is fun for him to do with you and HE has a positive experience that<br/>\nmight reduce his resistance to going along with just you guys another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s into videogames - what about a midnight release for a new game where<br/>\nyou go wait for hours in line with other game fans? That&#39;s outdoors! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teens who help plan the HomeSchool Association of California conference<br/>\ndid something really cool last year - they created a live-action Mario<br/>\ngame...it had mini-trampolines for jumping and all KINDS of cool stuff -<br/>\nincluding Mario himself! This year they&#39;re doing another videogame (I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember which). It was a huge hit! My local homeschool group did a<br/>\n&quot;Zoombinis Day&quot; once - that is an old computer game...and everyone dressed<br/>\nlike all the characters and the kids went around and solved puzzles like in<br/>\nthe game. Maybe your husband would help him create a live action version of<br/>\nhis favorite game and invite some friends over to play (outdoors).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to a museum once that had all kinds of amazing art from World of<br/>\nWarcraft...I did not know the game but the art was incredible and we spent<br/>\nan hour or two there - maybe more - and I thought it was super fun and<br/>\ninteresting.

That feels like being<br/>\npushed out - not drawn out by something enticing. Might he like to<br/>\nskateboard? Build a ramp? Play croquet? You said he likes swimming - can<br/>\nyou set up a regular, maybe daily, swimming opportunity? Can you get one of<br/>\nthose big above-ground pools (assuming you don&#39;t have a backyard pool).<br/>\nWould he like a trampoline to play on when his friends are over?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout his friends - he likes sleepovers with friends....where is he meeting<br/>\nthem and what do they do when having sleepovers? Maybe you can take him and<br/>\nsome friends to hit baseballs or drive bumpercars or play miniature golf?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you need to be careful about not too quickly rejecting ideas and<br/>\nyou need to be more creative and specific about what you want him to do<br/>\nwith you. And get over not wanting his friend along - if that makes it<br/>\npalatable for him, then that&#39;s an easy way to make it happen more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Apr 24, 2012 at 12:11 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You could tell your son you moved too fast for his dad, and he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need to go to school, but that you (the two of you, you and your son) do<br/>\n&gt; need to figure out how to schedule and do the things his dad wants, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] frustrated with 9 year old who rarely wants to participate in family life","postDate":"1335299264","msgId":66847,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4NzkwOEE5LThEQTItNDFCQy1BRDM4LUFBNUFFQjczNENDM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxRjA5NzM3LUZENkUtNDQxNy1CQUIxLTY0MDI1REM2NTE4NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpuNm4xcyttYWprQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTFGMDk3MzctRkQ2RS00NDE3LUJBQjEtNjQwMjVEQzY1MTg2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66846,"nextInTopic":66848,"prevInTime":66846,"nextInTime":66848,"topicId":66833,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s a whole world of things. If you keep stuffing them into one box, you&#39;ll keep seeing them as a single interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He used to have many interests - animals, bugs, playing outside, reading books. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless someone builds them, computers aren&#39;t interests. Computers are ways to access interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the variety of things he&#39;s doing on the computer, not the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re really saying is he used to have many interests that fit into your idea of the role he should play in the family. Now he doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s not keeping up his end of the bargain that *you* entered him into when you gave birth to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He would go to the park with his friends, but only when his friends were going, not when it was just the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you and your husband aren&#39;t providing the same kind of play as friends do. It&#39;s understandable. You&#39;re not kids. But you&#39;re taking it personally. It&#39;s not about you. It&#39;s about him finding ways to meet his needs. The need for him to play with you is your need. But it isn&#39;t a child&#39;s obligation to meet his parents&#39; needs. If you need him to play with you, go to him. Go into his world. If you would like him to be with you, he&#39;s more likely to come into your world if what you&#39;re offering meets the needs of his right now self, not the person he was 2 years ago, not  the ideal son you&#39;re holding in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He says there is nothing he wants to do and he really gets mopey.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s communicating that he doesn&#39;t know how to meet his needs with what you&#39;re offering.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re complaining that he&#39;s not as easy as you&#39;d like him to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This spring we are already starting to have issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which combination of you is the &quot;we&quot; referring to this time? The issue really isn&#39;t with him. IT&#39;s with your and your husband&#39;s expectations of who he should be. You&#39;re picturing a child who happily accompanies his parents on outings to complete the ideal family picture you&#39;re holding in your heads. And he&#39;s not living up to the ideal. Maybe if you&#39;d let him know that before he was born, he could have picked a different family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is resisting us when we say &quot;daddy is off work today and we would like to go do something&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who is &quot;we&quot;? I&#39;d resist too. It&#39;s not inviting. It&#39;s a royal pronouncement about how &quot;we&quot; must spend &quot;our&quot; day because &quot;we&quot; have had it up to here not getting &quot;our&quot; needs met.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to pull him into your world that doesn&#39;t meet his needs, make your world more inviting, more interesting for someone with his interests. It&#39;s not up to him to come up with ideas. It&#39;s not up to him to change who he is to like what you offer. Find new things to offer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd change your mind set. Right now you&#39;re trying to pull him away from the computer. And it&#39;s going to frustrate you every time he declines an offer. Instead focus on finding things he enjoys. *Not* finding things he enjoys away from the computer. Don&#39;t limit yourself to that. Find things he enjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want someone to set aside a busy life to join you for dinner, it helps not to serve them something they don&#39;t like. It helps to not get upset with them if they don&#39;t like the same foods they did before they became vegan. It helps to accept friends where they are. If too many obligations and expectations are piled on them that they can&#39;t meet, it strains relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son does want a relationship with you. But not the relationship you&#39;re trying to cast him into. He wants you to be his supporters. It&#39;s very typical of 9 yo boys. Every year it will be different somehow but it&#39;s not going to change back to when he was 8. If you accept him where he&#39;s at, you&#39;ll maintain a good relationship with him. If you create an ideal mold for him to fit into and keep being disappointed that he&#39;s not fitting into it, it will damage the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We will sit on the couch and play with him and watch him but we want to have lives outside of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this sums up your whole problem here. It&#39;s the &quot;we&quot; you&#39;re insisting on seeing the family as. You&#39;re a collection of unique individuals not a single unit. You and your husband sit and play with him. That&#39;s good. If you desire a relationship with someone, going to them is how you do it. You and your husband want more than video games. So find ways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help you find happiness and maintain a good relationships with your son to not make your happiness dependent on him. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: frustrated with 9 year old who rarely wants to participate in family life","postDate":"1335250060","msgId":66842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOaDd4RGhyS0Npc0Vfdk1hOG4xRTE1dmNiQ2lwLS1Xblh0RWlpMmg1M2orZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2MkVENUI0LTY4MzctNEJDOS1BNjgwLTREMzc0QTVDMjUwN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpuNTNqait0YnBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NjYyRUQ1QjQtNjgzNy00QkM5LUE2ODAtNEQzNzRBNUMyNTA3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66841,"nextInTopic":66843,"prevInTime":66841,"nextInTime":66843,"topicId":66833,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"9-year-olds really often like a lot of solitary activity.

They may still involve creatures, reading, and a world outside the home.  All of those things and more can be found on the computer and in video games.  It might be harder for you to see if you are not as engaged as he is in these new interests.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Last summer he stayed inside for a lot of it playing on the computer.  He would go swimming, and that was about it.  He would go to the park with his friends, but only when his friends were going, not when it was just the family.  He started resisting anything else last summer.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The word resisting makes me wonder what he was resisting.  From your post, it also very much sounds like you are resisting his interest in the computer and in video games, and lamenting the loss of other more seemingly worthy interests from his earlier childhood.  It will be difficult to connect if you are both resisting what each other is interested in.  If you want to spend more time together and reconnect with each, maybe bring some things you are interested in to the room your son is playing in.  I do this.  I draw, work on the computer, knit, build with lego or blocks, make things, do little experiments, read, all right close to my son while he plays his games.  He comes and checks out what I&#39;m doing, and I listen to what he is doing.  I learn a lot about my son by doing this.  Just today I could see he was reading, writing down codes, watching and understanding statistics, learning the how to change the story line of the game by changing strategies, singing along to the music in the game, exploring maps, finding secrets, experimenting with cause and effect, just to name a few things.  Very often I play with him, but I&#39;m not as into gaming as he is.  I do love it.  I just don&#39;t play as long or get into all the details and strategies.  There are some good books you could read while your son plays.  I liked &quot;Extra Lives:  Why Video Games Matter&quot; by Tom Bissell, &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom - I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc Prensky, and &quot;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&quot; by James Paul Gee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This spring we are already starting to have issues.  He is resisting us when we say &quot;daddy is off work today and we would like to go do something&quot;.  He says there is nothing he wants to do and he really gets mopey.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Resisting again...What if you said, &quot;Dad&#39;s home today.  Want to all play some video games together then head to the hobby shop to check out some new games.&quot;  Maybe on the way, you could stop at his favourite place to eat.  Talk to him in the car about his favourite strategy or character.  Put on some of his favourite game music.  My son loves the Terraria soundtrack, and through listening to it I have developed an appreciation for synthesized music.  It&#39;s really cool!  Maybe on the way home you could swing by a park for a quick game of creeper tag or some such thing.  Make the outing centered around him and his interests.  Gradually, when you son starts to really appreciate and believe that you understand, appreciate and want to support his interests, you could suggest that for part of the day you can all play games and part of the day you can go to the lake or whatever you and your husband feel like doing as a family.  If your son feels your generosity toward his interests, he will likely be more inclined toward generosity as well.  If you resist, he will resist.  If you mope, he will mope.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other 5 to 6 days a week we exactly what he wants to do.  Sit on the couch and play video games.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Consider what this might sound like to someone who enjoys painting:  One day a week we ask her to do something we want to do and she mopes about it.  The other 5 to 6 days a week we do exactly what she wants to do - stand around in front of a canvas with a brush in our hands.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we want to hang out with him, we have to sit on the couch and watch him or play with him.  He doesn&#39;t come to see what we are up to if we are in the garage or whatever.  He won&#39;t even watch movies anymore, which was really my husband&#39;s last thing that they both enjoyed doing together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We will sit on the couch and play with him and watch him but we want to have lives outside of that.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This all sounds like you and your husband are doing him some great favour by sitting on the couch every day, watching him play or playing video games with him.  And, you are doing him this favour despite the fact that you want to have a life apart from video games.  How do you think this translates to your son? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He seems very happy.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yay!!!  There is a little boy I know who we are very close to who is very unhappy.  He has to go to school every day to learn all of the things he is told he should know.  He is struggling with being labelled special needs, while (to me) being incredibly smart, creative and full of wonderful (though sometimes misdirected) energy.  He knocks on my door nearly every day asking for things he can&#39;t get at home.  He is not neglected, but he is misunderstood, and that makes him very, very unhappy.  Celebrate and nurture your son&#39;s happiness.

Can you explain how this is relevant?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-We will sit on the couch and play with him and watch him but we want to have lives outside of that.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you hire a babysitter who plays video games, and you and your husband go and do some things?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes, we do this for small things, but I couldn&#39;t imagine going to the lake to swim and fish and hang out and leave my 9 year old son at home with the babysitter.  The lake is fun.  And we are a family and we want to hang out with Joe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He won&#39;t be nine forever.  It&#39;s still Spring.

I said it started last summer (last spring actually) and is already showing signs of being worse this summer.

Or are you trying to do what you think a family should do when all three are in one place?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son attended school, and didn&#39;t want to go anywhere when he was home, that wouldn&#39;t seem too weird, because you and your husband could be thinking he had &quot;done&quot; lots of things at school (whether it was true or not) and school would seem like being out.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to do something with the family, try adding another child or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- animals, bugs, playing outside, reading books.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThose aren&#39;t necessarily huge hobbies.

There is one issue though that I feel like is getting worse and I am feeling pretty frustrated about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe rarely wants to go anywhere, or even wants to go outside. He&#39;s not interested in anything that doesn&#39;t involve the computer.  He used to have many interests - animals, bugs, playing outside, reading books.  The summer before last he hung outside with us and would talk to his dad about the garden or go fishing sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer he stayed inside for a lot of it playing on the computer.  He would go swimming, and that was about it.  He would go to the park with his friends, but only when his friends were going, not when it was just the family.  He started resisting anything else last summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis spring we are already starting to have issues.

It is his father and I that are getting unhappy.  His father is really having a hard time with it.  Yesterday he said to me &quot;when he got interested in video games this is exactly what I said - as long as he still likes to do other things I&#39;m fine with it&quot; <br/>\n... and now he doesn&#39;t like to do other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what to do or think here.  please help.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66829,"nextTopicId":66878}}
