In addition to stress and what it is physically it touches on depression and Alzheimer’s, but then it moves to parenting, and that’s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone who sees this will take time to go there and see that.  It’s four minutes and could make your grandchildren’s lives better.  Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers in the effects of alcoholism know that the behaviors can continue in people who are not themselves alcoholics, so that the grandchildren of alcoholics are also adversely affected even if it was a long time ago that alcohol was involved.  This explanation would probably cover that in more than one way—the alcoholism and alcohol-affected behavior and reactions would have affected the children, whose parenting (it has been assumed) suffered from not having better models or experiences.  Maybe that, too.  But the stress suffered by children of alcoholics could have created the factors described in the video.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s worth watching.  And it explains why it’s hard for someone who has become cynical and negative to “just” step away from that and to be more positive.  “Negativity is poison,” I’ve been saying.  This explains how negativity creates more of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76664,"nextTopicId":76691}}
