The 8 year old, who has more sauce in her than<br/>\nher older sister, would climb in my lap and whisper to<br/>\nme about wanting to stay up or steeling herself to not<br/>\nbe moved.  I was sympathetic, but unable to help her<br/>\nescape.  The reason given was that they &quot;looked<br/>\nexhausted&quot; and their parents &quot;won&#39;t have them being<br/>\ncranky&quot; the next day.  Cranky and crying at bedtime is<br/>\npreferable I guess.  Of course the adults were all<br/>\ntired too, staying up too late to visit, and several<br/>\nof them drinking far too much, but no one ordered them<br/>\nto stop or go to bed.  My own boys (7 and 8) stayed up<br/>\nas late as the wanted, as usual, and were not any more<br/>\nor less cranky than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My kids are, by contrast, direct and cheery, honest<br/>\n&gt;and responsible.<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This also brought to mind the overall bearing of my<br/>\naforementioned neices over the recent holiday:<br/>\nreticent to talk to adults, hesitant to express their<br/>\ndesires, and in particular the case of the 8 year old,<br/>\nusually looking forlorn and moody.

She is a <br/>\ncompetitive gymnast and works out 15 hours per week.  She also works at the <br/>\ngym as much as she can.  She is very involved in 4-H.  She has held pretty <br/>\nmuch every office available.  She raises goats and rabbits and auctions them <br/>\noff.  She uses the money to then pay for some of her gymnastics expenses, <br/>\nlike camp, that were beyond our means.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly,  Adriane is a happy teenager.  She is funny, kind, honest. <br/>\nShe is the kid that her friends&#39; moms want to have around as a good <br/>\ninfluence.
