While the activities chosen by  <br/>\nindividuals still show a distinct gender bias, when it comes to actual  <br/>\npower and respect within the SCA, males and females are almost (but  <br/>\nnot quite) equal. In eight of the last ten years the president of the  <br/>\nSCA has been female.&quot;<br/>\nI was most of that female presidency myself!  Cool mention.   I never  <br/>\nhad seen that article, because it was in a Canadian folklore journal  <br/>\nin 1989, and I was busy having babies in New Mexico.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO ANYway, I linked a couple of pages to that.  One is a description  <br/>\nof a &quot;bardic competition&quot; I designed and ran.  It was very smooth, and  <br/>\nreally good, and one way I prevented unhappiness with the judging is  <br/>\nthat anyone who wanted to and who stayed for the whole thing could be  <br/>\na judge.   I don&#39;t love competitions, but the first evening we used  <br/>\nthis format was fantastic, and the second time was at an international  <br/>\nSCA thing, the 25th anniversary event, and it worked really smoothly  <br/>\nthen, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout it having been a competition, maybe only half as many people  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve shown up, and the quality of the individual performances  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been lower, either because they weren&#39;t on high alert, as it  <br/>\nwere, or because they&#39;d be singing songs they liked for one reason or  <br/>\nanother, but weren&#39;t their best, or weren&#39;t the most period songs they  <br/>\nknew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like competitions, though, and for myself I prefer to do  <br/>\nsomething because it&#39;s a useful, good thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an article on music in the SCA, too.

The majority of those who buy a raffle  <br/>\nticket for an item lose, even if there are only three tickets.    <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s not a good thing to do in a group of people who are  <br/>\nworking toward creating an environment in which each child is a  <br/>\nwinner (or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, not everyone will get an A, and that&#39;s even if everyone  <br/>\nwere to really try.  If too many people made A&#39;s, they&#39;d raise the  <br/>\nhurdle, make the test harder or whatever.  A raffle with one winner  <br/>\nand 200 losers is designed to keep the money of the losers.  It&#39;s  <br/>\ngambling.  And honestly, in some (maybe all) states, it&#39;s not even  <br/>\nlegal unless the raffle tickets are issued by the state (or printed  <br/>\nat an approved printshop, bonded, familiar with all the laws...) and  <br/>\nregistered and all kinds of legalities about what kind of group can  <br/>\nhold a raffle and why and under what circumstances, and...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t participated in raffles at unschooling  <br/>\nconferences, but as soon as one kid&#39;s crying, it seems it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nworth the money that was gathered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Sensitive kids at conferences","postDate":"1233967796","msgId":41819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxRDU4QzFBLTYxNTUtNDRGOS04N0ZBLTc3RTFEQkEzMjhDREBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41822,"prevInTime":41818,"nextInTime":41820,"topicId":41819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am the raffle/silent auction coordinator  for the Life is Good conference in Vancouver, WA this year and wanted to ask if anyone had some ideas (either from","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-967787616\">I am the raffle/silent auction coordinator  for the Life is Good  <br/>\nconference in Vancouver, WA this year and wanted to ask if anyone had  <br/>\nsome ideas (either from experiences at conferences with their own kids  <br/>\nor observing what happens with other families) to help sensitive  <br/>\nchildren deal with the disappointment of &quot;losing&quot; a raffle item or  <br/>\nbeing outbid on a particularly tempting auction basket.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe already have an &quot;Instant Gratification Table&quot; with mostly little  <br/>\nkid stuff for a $1 ticket, which helps.
