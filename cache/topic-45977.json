Yesterday I  <br/>\nwas up to move (because I get tense and agitated, and so I get up to  <br/>\ndo something physical) and realized, as I was loading the washing  <br/>\nmachine, that there&#39;s not another person who could do this better than  <br/>\nI can.   Kind of obvious, perhaps, but realizing that no one else in  <br/>\nthe world could summarize my website remotely close to the way I can  <br/>\ndo it calmed me right down.   (Being calmed down passes, because it&#39;s  <br/>\na big job and I think really fast and I get tired of thinking and  <br/>\nwriting.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If anyone wants to hear what I sound like in my regular life or see<br/>\nwhat I look like (that&#39;s not the good part, if there&#39;s a good part),<br/>\nthe link above has something very recent, and if you want to support a<br/>\nproject to get some of this stuff on a DVD that would be available by<br/>\nfall or end of summer, there&#39;s a link for that there, too.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not for looking at.   That&#39;s not a bad thing.  Maybe I&#39;m worth  <br/>\nlistening to anyway.  I think my writing is better than my speaking,  <br/>\nbut here&#39;s some more of that.  My point was that if people wanted to  <br/>\nhave a voice and all to go with my writing, there was a sample of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I really cared what I looked like maybe I would wear makeup or get  <br/>\na haircut or wear something besides a t-shirt, but honestly that&#39;s not  <br/>\nwhere I have EVER lived, in looks.  I&#39;ve lived in my head and in  <br/>\nbooks, and for most of you I live on this list or my blogs.  It  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually matter what I look like at all, to anyone who reads  <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a little e-mail exchange between the filmmaker and me the other  <br/>\nday:<br/>\n<br/>\nLee:<br/>\nI thought it was good....Lauren did, too...<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; You guys know more about it than I do.  I just see all the flaws and  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like my face and don&#39;t like my voice, but it&#39;s nice that the  <br/>\n&gt; curtain was moving.  The plant looked good!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The information was probably good, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I suppose when I&#39;m even older or maybe dead, it will be great  <br/>\n&gt; that these recordings exist, so thank you for that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lee:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For a lot of people, I think it&#39;s good they exist right now. Even  <br/>\n&gt; with you alive and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not fishing for compliments or support.  There are things about me  <br/>\nthat cause me no hesitation or concern.  Having a bunch of people  <br/>\npaying to look at my face... I pause for a moment.    So it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I . . . hope<br/>\nmy girls will not equate their worth with their or others<br/>\nperceptions of their physical appeal, and I hope my sons<br/>\nwill not measure their girlfriends&#39; worth by that standard.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Worth&quot; for what, though?  I type REALLY fast.  I&#39;m pretty good with  <br/>\npens and ink and I have screen printing equipment.  That&#39;s worth  <br/>\nsomething--my knowledge and experience.  I know a lot about  <br/>\nunschooling; that&#39;s worth something.  I amuse Keith and I make his bed  <br/>\nand do his laundry.  He likes that.  That&#39;s part of my worth in our  <br/>\nrelationship--he&#39;s well rested and has work clothes every morning.   <br/>\nMarty&#39;s girlfriend can sew.  That&#39;s HUGELY useful, because they&#39;re  <br/>\nboth in the SCA and they need costumes.   She doesn&#39;t cook.  She&#39;s not  <br/>\nworth as much as someone who can cook, in terms of providing food for  <br/>\na potential future family.  That&#39;s worth considering, on Marty&#39;s  <br/>\npart.  How poor will they be if they eat out all the time, or how  <br/>\nhealthy if they have to eat microwavable freezer food all the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when physical attributes are important for certain  <br/>\nthings.  A friend was in the honor guard doing rifle drill routines  <br/>\nand marching with flags and coffins at Arlington National Cemetery.   <br/>\nHe was doing that partly, perhaps, because he was a little crazy and  <br/>\nit was safer than putting him in other jobs.  But the criteria for  <br/>\nbeing at that task were being over 6&#39; tall and not having facial  <br/>\nscars.  It got him out of combat, which might have been good for more  <br/>\npeople than himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m missing the point a little, but I don&#39;t feel ashamed of  <br/>\nhaving been self-deprecating about a little video.  I&#39;m willing to be  <br/>\npersuaded otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need someone to sing into a microphone, hand it to me.  If you  <br/>\nneed someone to swim across a river, I&#39;m not the one.<br/>\nIf you need someone to be the beautiful face of unschooling, I could  <br/>\nrecommend several people.  If we need a billboard, put Brenna and  <br/>\nHolly.   For moms?  Kelli Traaseth.  Ren Allen.  Danielle Conger.  Let  <br/>\nthem be the pinup moms, if we need some.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a little more video of me, about saying &quot;Yes&quot;","postDate":"1245868854","msgId":46038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgxdHJ2bStvOGwxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxdG92ZitudGhtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46037,"nextInTopic":46039,"prevInTime":46037,"nextInTime":46039,"topicId":45977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t buy into the idea that ...

Sometimes that level of understanding on<br/>\ntheir part surprises me because they are both really young.<br/>\n<br/>\nCyle&#39;s dad was initially really concerned that Chamille was older than<br/>\nhis son and that they were so intense with each other.
