Once those spaces have been sold the theatre has gone beyond the<br/>\nreasonable accommodation required by law. If the theatre has a &quot;no refund/no<br/>\nexchange&quot; policy, which most do, there is no requirement that the theatre<br/>\nexchange your tickets for wheelchair accessible seats. Most theatres will if<br/>\nthey are available, but there is nothing requiring it.<br/>\nAll of the theatres I know of do their best to accommodate all of their<br/>\npatrons.

These went through several <br/>\nprintings and Borge must have signed hundreds of them.  She can probably find <br/>\na decent reading copy for $10, and a signed first for $25.  As a matter of <br/>\nfact, I have a spare copy of &quot;My Favorite Intermissions&quot; in the eBay pile <br/>\nupstairs, a first in very good condition with dj.  I&#39;d send it to her for $10 <br/>\npostpaid just to avoid the hassle of listing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering how many duplicate copies of how many things we have lying <br/>\naround.  Our eBay pile is upstairs, so I haven&#39;t sold much of anything since <br/>\nI broke my ankle.  Somehow, even with the cast off I can&#39;t get upstairs more <br/>\nthan once or twice a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps you in your quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sources for Music Anecdotes","postDate":"1039197187","msgId":11153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYTkwMWMyOWQ1MiQxM2E1YjA2MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDY4LjI5YWYwM2FmLjJiMjE2OGM3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11143,"nextInTopic":11154,"prevInTime":11152,"nextInTime":11154,"topicId":11139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
