I really doubt it, and she didn&#39;t need to - she can still feel <br/>\nlike a wonderful mother, which she is/was and just let it be!  After the <br/>\nbeginning, I just quit discussing it with her - I got so tired of her asking <br/>\nme when I was going to sit the kids down and teach them.  We have always <br/>\nlived a great distance apart, so that has helped.  And why do you have to SIT <br/>\nto learn anyway??<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13542,"nextTopicId":13413}}
