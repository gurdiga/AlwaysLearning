BUT,<br/>\nthere is NO space here!! He says he has too many but if he had a<br/>\nnormal room they wouldn&#39;t take up but a corner in it!<br/>\nWhen I clean up Ron likes it but ya know it doesn&#39;t last. I am always<br/>\ntrying to think of solutions but come up emptyhanded.(619&#39; house) I<br/>\nwould like to have a big playroom outside,maybe a tent for his toys.<br/>\nThat would be good for the fall and winter. Maybe,too hot in the summer.<br/>\nI feel Ron is also hating on Lukas a lot. For example, when he tells<br/>\nLukas to do something and he doesn&#39;t listen or&quot;obey&quot; him. Ron says he<br/>\nneeds a whipping.<br/>\nNo matter how it made him feel growing up with whippings or the info I<br/>\nhave provided about it. Lukas never has one and will not as long as<br/>\nI&#39;m here.I tell Ron that when I want to get Lukas in I say: Hey,<br/>\nSweetheart,let&#39;s go in so I can eat or whatever and we can go back out<br/>\nin awhile okay? Lukas mostly agrees and comes with me. Ron barks<br/>\norders at him then gets mad because he doesn&#39;t listen! Ron wants Lukas<br/>\nto understand he is the authority figure. I tell him when I respect<br/>\nLukas he does me. But Ron won&#39;t try it...argh!! What to do????<br/>\nsorry,if my problems seem redudant. Dh also says Lukas shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\neating sugar,it makes him hyper. Lukas is always in his way or will<br/>\nnot listen. Lukas is 6yo.<br/>\nI want to add that we don&#39;t have &quot;normal bedrooms,you walk from the<br/>\nliving room into Lukas and my bedroom and you have to go thru that to<br/>\nget to the kitchen/bathroom. there is a small bedroom that Ron sleeps in.<br/>\nWe can not sell yet. The home is owner finiaced,in little more then<br/>\ntwo years we have it paid off. I did cross post this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31134,"nextTopicId":31161}}
