The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-682960124\">I was reading this thread and got to the point about<br/>\nthe &quot;consequence&quot; of cleaning up something you break. <br/>\nI was reminded of the other night here at home.  The<br/>\nthree adults in the house had just finished playing a<br/>\nboard game.  We were picking up, rising from the table<br/>\nto get ready for bed.  I took a small glass dish on<br/>\nthe table and slid it closer to the edge, thinking I<br/>\nwould pick it up when I got up to take it to the sink.<br/>\n The table it seems was exceptionally slick however,<br/>\nmaybe because Tom had made bread on it that day, and<br/>\nthe dish instead sailed clean off the table and had a<br/>\nmini explosion on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was somewhat late and we were all pretty tired.  I<br/>\nwas staring stupidly at the reamins of the dish for a<br/>\nfew seconds, and then we all just looked at each other<br/>\nand started laughing.  Thomas (9), coming to<br/>\ninvestigate the noise, took the kittens out of the<br/>\nroom so they would not cut their feet on glass shards.<br/>\n Nicole and I moved the chairs and things out of the<br/>\nway and Tom went to fetch broom and dustpan to sweept<br/>\nup, all without discussing it or doing more than<br/>\nlaughing and my recieving a bit of gentle ribbing for<br/>\nlaunching the dish to it&#39;s demise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing that we were all tired, my potentially being<br/>\nable to have a cranky response at that time and having<br/>\nbeen a bit stunned by what happened at first, if they<br/>\nhad instead reminded me to clean it up, not moved to<br/>\nhelp me and been less congenial overall, I think it<br/>\nwould have been a much bigger deal than it needed to<br/>\nbe and I would have felt overall a lot worse about<br/>\nsomething ultimately pretty stupid and minor.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsure glad no one informed me of the consequences of my<br/>\nactions or directed me to see to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23695,"nextTopicId":23698}}
