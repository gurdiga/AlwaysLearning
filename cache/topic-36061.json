My partner and I are raising 3 of her 7 grandkids.<br/>\nTheir young mother and aunts are all focused on looking &quot;sexy&quot;, hip<br/>\nhop culture, TV and video games. Not much else interests them and they<br/>\nfind me weird because I want more for the kids I&#39;m raising. The mom<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t support homeschooling because she thinks the kids will miss<br/>\nout on the fun of socializing at school (cutting classes, doing drugs,<br/>\nPDAs with your boyfriend, etc). None of my partner&#39;s daughters<br/>\nfinished high school or even got a GED, nor have they experienced much<br/>\nbeyond &quot;consumer culture&quot;. They seem to me to have very limited lives<br/>\nand outlooks, including a &quot;learning&#39;s not cool&quot; attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids we&#39;re raising are 13 (the boy), 11 and almost 9 (a couple<br/>\nweeks). I&#39;ve been homeschooling them for about 2 years and they were<br/>\nvery receptive at first (I tried a Charlotte Mason/Robertson approach,<br/>\nemphasizing reading and independent work), but then mom told them she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want them to be homeschooled. They&#39;ve been less receptive since. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is how do you deal with family influence that<br/>\nisn&#39;t abusive exactly but is not only unsupportive, it undermines.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to any and all thoughts, thanks!<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36128,"nextTopicId":36154}}
