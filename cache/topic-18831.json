I&#39;m going to share Rain&#39;s story with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also appreciate hearing the story because I&#39;m now relating it to our<br/>\nsituation.  We&#39;re moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving an area that I love,  Bemidji, MN.  Northern Minnesota-- pine trees,<br/>\nlakes, rivers.  Lots of woods.  We live on a 2 1/2 acre wooded lot close to<br/>\na lake, miles and miles of trails for either hiking, biking or cross country<br/>\nskiing.  All of which I love to do.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so you get the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re moving to Moorhead, MN,  right across the river from Fargo, ND.  Yes,<br/>\nFargo.  Not quite like the movie,  but close.  That area of MN/ND is very<br/>\ndifferent from Bemidji.  Its on the prairie and has lots of open spaces.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll probably be moving into town,  hardly no yard,  but pretty good sized<br/>\nhouse.  Another interesting detail will be that both sets of grandparents<br/>\nlive there and my 2 sister in-laws and 1 brother in-law.  Which could be<br/>\ngood and bad.  2 of the 3 in-laws are teachers and don&#39;t get unschooling at<br/>\nall.  Two grandparents really get unschooling pretty well,  the other 2<br/>\ndon&#39;t but are at least trying.  So that won&#39;t be too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo,,,  when I first hear that my husband has been offered this job I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering,, what are thinking??<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I start thinking,  bigger city.   Maybe there can be more<br/>\nopportunities for the kids.    Through all of this we have been talking with<br/>\nthe kids about it all.  At first they aren&#39;t very happy, leaving their<br/>\nfriends and all.  But we&#39;re doing this because my dh is really unhappy in<br/>\nhis job now and its an opportunity for him.  They are excited to see their<br/>\ngrandparents and counsins more.   I&#39;m also hoping that with more people<br/>\nthere might be some unschoolers there!<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Dar&#39;s story,  well,  with Fargo/Moorhead being a bigger community<br/>\nthe girls will have more opportunities for acting, singing, dancing.<br/>\nBemidji only has about 15,000, F-M has about 150,000.   There&#39;s more people,<br/>\nhence, more shows and things like that!    So,  there is becoming this<br/>\nsilver lining.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a son (10)  who is a big gamer and trading card player.  I<br/>\nbelieve a bigger city will have lots more going on for him too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m trying to see this as maybe a transitional time where the kids are<br/>\ngoing to have more opportunities and maybe I can get my bits of woods and<br/>\nsuch on weekends or on vacations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are now getting pretty excited,  they don&#39;t like the woods and<br/>\noutdoors quite as much as me.  I&#39;m remembering back, my husband and I both<br/>\ngrew up in Moorhead, that there are some trails by the Red River.  Its<br/>\namidst city,  but there are some trees there.  Also, we are moving farther<br/>\nwest, so we can get to Montana/ Yellowstone and all of that quicker!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to be OK,  I&#39;ll try and find my peace in pockets of nature and<br/>\nin the fact that the kids and my dh will be  happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~  trying to be optimistic about it all<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com\">alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 18, 2004 10:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] First job<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rain will be working as an actress, playing one of the stepsisters in a<br/>\n&gt; dinner theatre production of Cinderella. She had so much fun at the<br/>\n&gt; audition that she was still walking on clouds an hour later, and the<br/>\n&gt; stepsister is just a dream role for her. She would have done it for<br/>\n&gt; free... but they&#39;re paying her for all rehearsals and shows, starting<br/>\n&gt; from call time. The show rehearses for 4 weeks and then runs for 12<br/>\n&gt; weeks, with two shows for school groups on Wednesdays and a show open to<br/>\n&gt; the public on Saturdays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I may be biased, as her mother, but I thought she really stood out at the<br/>\n&gt; audition. She was thinking, she was innovating, she was creating. She<br/>\n&gt; remembered the basics - project, speak slowly and enunciate, stay in<br/>\n&gt; character,don&#39;t block other actors  - while adding appropriate and funny<br/>\n&gt; physical movements and hilarious expressions, interacting with the other<br/>\n&gt; characters on stage, and saying her lines so they sounded fresh even<br/>\n&gt; after 5 groups had run the same scene. I was and am very, very proud.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18824,"nextTopicId":18832}}
