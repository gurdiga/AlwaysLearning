Yelling at the dresser helps, and makes it funny <br/>\nand stops it from hurting so much. Linnaea (6) knows the dresser didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally jump out and bump her, but since it is an inanimate object it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hurt it to be yelled at.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or do you explain to them why it really happened?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They know why, they were there, they saw what happened. I tend to just <br/>\nsweep them in my arms and cuddle them. If it is an interpersonal <br/>\nconflict, as opposed to them against the dresser I offer to help, I try <br/>\ndistractions, I try compromise. Sometimes it is because they&#39;re hungry <br/>\nor tired, and so I offer food and maybe a movie or something to relax <br/>\nagainst. Sometimes it is because beating the starship fleet on the <br/>\ngamecube is so frustratingly impossible that it just makes the rest of <br/>\nthe world dark and wrong. So, I read from the book (if we have a prima <br/>\nguide)  or look up hints and cheats on the internet or I just offer to <br/>\nhelp the one who isn&#39;t frustrated, usually Linnaea as she likes games <br/>\nshe has greater competence in than does Simon (9 tomorrow!!), find <br/>\nsomething else to do, something that isn&#39;t right there watching Simon <br/>\ngrow so frustrated that he just can&#39;t do what he wants to do that he <br/>\nlashes out at her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, i think a seven year old boy is quite old enough to put a chip<br/>\n&gt; bag in the trash instead of throwing it on the floor. I see two year<br/>\n&gt; olds that can throw away trash. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not always old enough at 38 to make sure that all the chips go in <br/>\nthe trash or my mouth. Sometimes they end up on my shirt front or on the <br/>\nfloor around me &#39;cause I&#39;m just not paying attention. Sometimes David <br/>\npicks them up for me. He does that a lot when I cook, I&#39;m not a very <br/>\ntidy cook. More often I pick up the chips, or the bags they came in. <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea have a favorite seat in the house. It&#39;s on the back of <br/>\nthe sofa nearest the television next to the radiator. It&#39;s warm and cozy <br/>\nand the center of visual entertainment. They tend to eat there. So, <br/>\nbehind the sofa it is often a bit crumby and gross. Knowing that, <br/>\nknowing that it wasn&#39;t conscious on their part, it is standard operating <br/>\nprocedure to move the couch whenever we clean and vacuum behind it. If I <br/>\nsee them throw a bag on the floor I&#39;ll ask if they could take it to the <br/>\ntrash, or say &quot;empty packets go in the trash&quot; or something like that. Or <br/>\nI might just pick it up and put it in the trash. It depends on if I was <br/>\nmoving in the first place, it depends on what they were doing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t tell my children to go in their<br/>\n&gt; room and scream because i don&#39;t want to listen to what they are<br/>\n&gt; saying. It&#39;s that they become unreasonable to the point that i can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even try explaining the situation to them over the yelling, and they<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t stop yelling to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe if you helped them get through that moment, just be there, or walk <br/>\naway from them, or whatever needs to happen in that moment and then talk <br/>\nabout it later. If David (dh) snaps at me at a bad moment, says I told <br/>\nyou so or talks about how I could have done something better while I&#39;m <br/>\nstill coping with the badness that happened, I&#39;m really far more likely <br/>\nto snap at him then listen. It is very easy for me to turn my <br/>\nfrustration in that moment outward. If, however, we talk about it later, <br/>\ntalk about what might have worked after I&#39;ve relaxed about it, I&#39;m far <br/>\nmore receptive. I&#39;ve found that with Simon and Linnaea waiting for a <br/>\nbetter moment to talk about ways to deal with whatever happened helps a <br/>\nlot, just like it does with me. Simon is the more sensitive of the two <br/>\nof them, the more likely to be upset by what he sees as his own personal <br/>\nfailings. If I can offer him tools for getting through a situation, ways <br/>\nof repairing a mistake he made, like when he deleted Linnaea&#39;s Mario <br/>\ndancemat memory from the memory card, it helps him to see a way out. <br/>\nOtherwise it feels, for him, like he cannot ever recover from such a <br/>\nhorrible thing. If I put him in a time out until he calmed down enough, <br/>\nit would be adding insult to injury. I have suggested to him that he <br/>\nmight want to calm down, go upstairs for a little bit, remove himself <br/>\nfrom what is making him so upset. I&#39;ve done the same with Linnaea, but <br/>\nfor her separation from people is far more punitive than it is for <br/>\nSimon. So, it isn&#39;t always a helpful course of action. I write this as <br/>\nthough these moments are calm moments which is false. These are moments <br/>\nof intense unhappiness, I hate discord between the two of them. I hate <br/>\ndiscord between the four of us for that matter. And when it happens, I <br/>\nam ever so actively looking for solutions. Sometimes, the hardest thing <br/>\nfor me, the best thing to do is let whoever is hurting come to a point <br/>\nwhere they are ready to be helped. And that may just mean giving them <br/>\nspace. Not forcing them to take it, but getting Simon or Linnaea to move <br/>\nwith me somewhere else so that the hurt person can lick their wounds and <br/>\ndecide when they want to reach out again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nerf balls and paper airplanes are<br/>\n&gt; great, if that&#39;s what they decide to throw, but they throw whatever<br/>\n&gt; they choose to. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then get a good book of how to make paper airplanes, or look on-line for <br/>\nplanes, and whenever they start to throw something that you don&#39;t like <br/>\nmake a plane. Put a nerf ball in their hands. Make parachutes and drop <br/>\nthem out of the windows with them, or down from the banister. Distract <br/>\nthem with the appropriate toy and use that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Books specifically really upset me, and i have tried<br/>\n&gt; to explain to them how valuable books are. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Books aren&#39;t inherently valuable. And are relatively easy to replace. <br/>\nBut, getting hit upside the head by the corner of a hardback edition of <br/>\nanything hurts. Books may be valuable to you, but maybe other things are <br/>\nmore valuable to them. Books aren&#39;t that valuable to me unless they <br/>\ncontain something I want from them. I have a couple of books that were <br/>\nmy grandmother&#39;s that I am quite fond of, so I don&#39;t put them in <br/>\naccessible places. But otherwise, while I enjoy books, I don&#39;t hold them <br/>\nin higher esteem than I do my good relationship with my children .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suppose i should just let my children scream, run, hit each other, and<br/>\n&gt; break things and shouldn&#39;t punish them at all, and they will suddenly<br/>\n&gt; learn to respect me, and they will stop running, screaming and hitting<br/>\n&gt; and listen to me trying to explain things to them about how life<br/>\n&gt; works. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could. But it wouldn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t let Simon and Linnaea hit each <br/>\nother and break things. I don&#39;t punish them.

Lots of different approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what Tami said deserves repeating:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we&#39;re telling you how your kids see you and your behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The thing that book helped me to see was that my daughter was  <br/>\nbehaving according to *her* perception of the world, and her  <br/>\nperception -- since she&#39;s a different person -- was just as valid as  <br/>\nmine. If I reacted to her according to my perception of the world she  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to understand. I needed to understand why she was  <br/>\nbehaving as she was. What it was her behavior was telling me she  <br/>\nneeded. And to *trust* that her needs were valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that it was &quot;right&quot; for her to leave all the toys out all  <br/>\nthe time. It&#39;s not that I was &quot;right&quot; to want them put away. It&#39;s  <br/>\njust that we had different goal and different needs. The way to  <br/>\napproach two humans who have conflicting wants and needs isn&#39;t for  <br/>\nthe big person to make the little person do what the big person  <br/>\nthinks is &quot;sensible&quot;. (Nor even to wear the little person down by  <br/>\nexplaining why the big person is right and the little person is wrong!)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Trust* that your children don&#39;t want to get hurt. It&#39;s not something  <br/>\nyou need to teach them! But sometimes running (or whatever) is a  <br/>\ngreater overriding want. Help them. Be their partner in getting what  <br/>\nthey want. When they know that you&#39;re on their side, when they know  <br/>\nthat you&#39;re there to help them get what *they* want, then they&#39;ll  <br/>\nlisten to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now you&#39;re giving them what you think they should want, eg,  <br/>\nfreedom from pain for instance. But to get them to hear what you&#39;re  <br/>\nsaying you need to listen to what they&#39;re trying to tell you. And  <br/>\nhelp them get that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *isn&#39;t* just one path to a goal. If they&#39;re running in the  <br/>\nhouse breaking things, the answer isn&#39;t to let them. The answer is to  <br/>\nrealize they need to run and get them out of the house. Is it always  <br/>\npossible to get them out of the house? No. But the more you set aside  <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing to make it possible, the more you put your  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s needs above other needs, the more they&#39;ll come to trust  <br/>\nthat you really are working to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids trust that you will get them out of the house to help  <br/>\nthem run -- trust built up from lots of experience with you following  <br/>\nthrough and rarely backing out (and apologizing when you do) -- then  <br/>\nit will be less difficult for them to stop running for a while than  <br/>\nwhen they hear &quot;Don&#39;t run or you&#39;ll get hurt.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean always set aside other things. This isn&#39;t about  <br/>\nrules. It&#39;s about principles. It&#39;s about helping kids trust that your  <br/>\ngoal is to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more we show that we&#39;re trying to help them get what they want,  <br/>\nthe more they&#39;ll trust us and the more they&#39;ll accept the times when  <br/>\nwe can&#39;t right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also not about becoming a slave to your kids and a nonentitiy  <br/>\nwith no wants and needs of your own. It&#39;s about *wanting* to be their  <br/>\npartner. It&#39;s about putting them a first priority and working the  <br/>\nrest of life around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* easy to see housework, cooking, shopping as things that  <br/>\nneed done and children&#39;s needs as something that we can set aside for  <br/>\nafter. We can say our children&#39;s needs are our first priority but if  <br/>\nwe *act* as if they aren&#39;t, if we are often saying &quot;I have to do this  <br/>\nthing before I help you&quot; then that says to the kids-- even if we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t intend it to -- that our &quot;thing&quot; is more important than they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I didn&#39;t say that i<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t comfort my children when they get hurt. Of course i do, but then<br/>\n&gt; i also explain why it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A long time ago, I wanted to back into the drive so I pulled over to  <br/>\nthe side of the road to let the cars behind me pass. Unfortunately  <br/>\nthe side of the road had a sharp granite curb sticking out from an  <br/>\nasphalt curb and I slashed the tire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went in and told my husband and he went out and checked out the  <br/>\ntire and said we&#39;d have to go get a new one. I thought, &quot;Wow, what a  <br/>\ngreat way to react to my very embarrassing and stupid mistake!&quot; He  <br/>\nconcentrated on the problem and how to solve it. Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then he said &quot;You should be more careful next time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that just erased all the good he&#39;d built up. What it said was  <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t trust me to learn from experience. He had to *tell* me  <br/>\nwhat I should learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n(That incident stands out because he rarely tells me what I should  <br/>\nhave learned!)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust your kids. Trust that they can learn from life. Do give them  <br/>\ninformation. (If you were about to cut off your hand with a table saw  <br/>\nyou&#39;d *want* someone to stop you!) But trust that -- even when they  <br/>\naren&#39;t making the choices you would -- that they&#39;re intelligent  <br/>\nbeings. If they&#39;re making different choices than you think are  <br/>\n&quot;sensible&quot; then there&#39;s something they want that&#39;s worth the  <br/>\nconsequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we should be giving our kids information so they can make  <br/>\nchoices that move them towards what they want. But if we&#39;ve given  <br/>\nthem the information and they&#39;re still doing something that seems  <br/>\nwrong to you, then either 1) they aren&#39;t ready to understand or 2)  <br/>\nthey want something else that overrides the information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like they need to run more than they need to avoid getting  <br/>\nhurt. The answer isn&#39;t to tell them how not to get hurt but to give  <br/>\nthem more opportunities to run, and accept the fact that when they&#39;re  <br/>\nrunning in the house that running is more important to them at the  <br/>\nmoment and that it&#39;s worth it to them that they might get hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is about recognizing the consequences of our choices and  <br/>\nchoosing to put up with some consequences to get something better.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202326349,"authorName":"Tami","from":"&quot;Tami&quot; &lt;atj090@...&gt;","profile":"jamitory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Normal situations at somebody else&#39;s house","postDate":"1144654443","msgId":25066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENORURKSUJIRUdGSUFEQUFQT0ROR0VKRUNFQUEuYXRqMDkwQGdhbGF4eS5vY24ubmUuanA+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5NTIzMzIwOTAxODA2Y2I2MDI0MGNiMGQ2MjRlNTE4QGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":25064,"nextInTopic":25072,"prevInTime":25065,"nextInTime":25067,"topicId":25048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the topic of stuff used for other than its intended purpose, and the smashy smashy thing...

(Purple was all they had<br/>\nat the PX when we got the sandbox, so purple is what we have...it looks nice<br/>\nsprinkled on the brown carpet. :) )  Adam, (3) plays out there for hours<br/>\nwith the sand, the hose, and whatever else he can find.  He usually takes<br/>\nthe lid off the sandbox and shovels sand into it and then adds water and<br/>\nleaves, and twigs... We&#39;ve asked him to keep the water out of the main part<br/>\nof the sandbox as drying it out would be difficult because of ever present<br/>\nrain and wind.  He has always been happy to oblige...until today.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Today, I went outside to find the sandbox full of water (a few inches of<br/>\npurple sand remained in the bottom) and two happy boys-- Adam and his baby<br/>\nbrother, Jomy (16 mos) doing &quot;cannonballs&quot; into the sandbox  from the<br/>\nlid...&quot;Look Mama!  We have a beach!&quot;  And so they did!  Jomy was thrilled<br/>\nwith the feel of the wet sand between his toes, and sat in the &quot;beachy&quot;<br/>\nwater playing happily while Adam splashed him with his cannonballs.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nguess we&#39;ll be able to dry out the sand, but will spread it around the patio<br/>\nwet and sweep it into the overgrown lot next door as it dries...that which<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t blow away first.

I didn&#39;t say that i<br/>\ndon&#39;t comfort my children when they get hurt. Of course i do, but then<br/>\ni also explain why it happened. Is it okay to let a child blame the<br/>\ndresser that they got injured when you are trying to teach them self<br/>\nresponsibility? Or do you explain to them why it really happened?<br/>\nAlso, i think a seven year old boy is quite old enough to put a chip<br/>\nbag in the trash instead of throwing it on the floor. I see two year<br/>\nolds that can throw away trash. I&#39;m with my children almost all the<br/>\ntime. I don&#39;t think you know enough about me to say that i&#39;m not with<br/>\nmy children enough. I stay home, have a small home, and rarely have<br/>\neven family babysit for me. I don&#39;t tell my children to go in their<br/>\nroom and scream because i don&#39;t want to listen to what they are<br/>\nsaying. It&#39;s that they become unreasonable to the point that i can&#39;t<br/>\neven try explaining the situation to them over the yelling, and they<br/>\nwon&#39;t stop yelling to listen. Nerf balls and paper airplanes are<br/>\ngreat, if that&#39;s what they decide to throw, but they throw whatever<br/>\nthey choose to. Books specifically really upset me, and i have tried<br/>\nto explain to them how valuable books are. I think it&#39;s a bit harsh to<br/>\ntalk about having cruelty in my heart when i came here for advice. I<br/>\nsuppose i should just let my children scream, run, hit each other, and<br/>\nbreak things and shouldn&#39;t punish them at all, and they will suddenly<br/>\nlearn to respect me, and they will stop running, screaming and hitting<br/>\nand listen to me trying to explain things to them about how life<br/>\nworks. By the way, no, i don&#39;t blame the children, i think i already<br/>\nstated that i realize i&#39;m the one making the mistakes.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1675643,"authorName":"Cally Brown","from":"Cally Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","profile":"cally_marg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Normal situations at my house","postDate":"1144624512","msgId":25050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0Mzk5NTgwLjMwMTA1MDlAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4=","referencesHeader":"PGUxYnJjMytidjVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25049,"nextInTopic":25051,"prevInTime":25049,"nextInTime":25051,"topicId":25048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So one one hand you expect your children to understand the natural consequences in cases like this... ...

If the child never wants to use a magnifying glass, the loss <br/>\nis unimportant. If they do, they will learn that smashing it was a not <br/>\nsuch a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is, that it doesn&#39;t sound to me like they are breaking <br/>\ntheir stuff, but rather they are breaking your stuff. The way you talk <br/>\nabout it, you don&#39;t actually regard it as their stuff, you haven&#39;t given <br/>\nover ownership and therefore responsibility of it to them. Why should it <br/>\nupset you so much if it was truely theirs in the first place? Why should <br/>\nbreaking one part of their stuff, mean that you take away something else <br/>\n- the playstation - which should be theirs also, but obviously isn&#39;t. If <br/>\nyou gave your neighbour a present, and she broke it, would you rant at <br/>\nher and then go and take away her playstation as punishment?

I don&#39;t have<br/>\nrules about things like bedtimes and how much they play video games or<br/>\nwatch television, or other things like that. I have always believed in<br/>\ntrying not to immose unnecessary structure and control on my children.<br/>\nMy rules are more along the lines of: Don&#39;t run and scream through the<br/>\nhouse,(people get hurt, and this disrespects other people&#39;s space) go<br/>\noutside and do it. Clean up after yourself,(being responsible for your<br/>\nown messes, this also disrespects other people&#39;s space) put your food<br/>\ntrash in the trash can, not on the floor. Don&#39;t throw things in the<br/>\nhouse(people get hurt, toys, videos, books and windows get broken, and<br/>\nthis also disrespects other people&#39;s space). All these types of rules<br/>\nhave valid reasons behind them, that i do explain to my children over<br/>\nand over again. It seems that just understanding why i tell them<br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t enough for them. They will still run through the house<br/>\nhurt themselves on furniture and then come screaming to me about it,<br/>\nand worst of all, they will yell blame at the furniture for hurting<br/>\nthem, when THEY ran into It. I will say &quot;It&#39;s not the dresser&#39;s fault<br/>\nyou got hurt. The dresser didn&#39;t move, you ran into it because you<br/>\nwere runing in the house and not paying attention to what you were<br/>\ndoing and what is around you&quot;.<br/>\nMy children break their things on purpose, hit and yell at each other,<br/>\ncall names, throw tantrums, refuse to do what i ask them. They don&#39;t<br/>\nlisten well and i have to say everything several times, just to get<br/>\ntheir attention. I just don&#39;t understand how my husband and i have<br/>\ncaused all of it. We take care of our belongings. We don&#39;t hit and<br/>\nscream at each other. In a lot of ways we set good examples. I will<br/>\nadmit that we both lose our tempers eventually and yell at the boys,<br/>\nbut never name calling, insults or cutdowns. And they aren&#39;t paying us<br/>\nany attention at all before we get to the point of yelling. We have<br/>\nboth been reading a book lately titled Scream Free Parenting, and<br/>\ntrying to incorporate the methods it teaches into our parenting, but<br/>\nyou can&#39;t perfect anything over night.<br/>\nI try to be responsible for my own actions and not blame others when<br/>\nthings don&#39;t go right for me. I try to respect other people and their<br/>\nspace, but my children don&#39;t seem to pick any of it up. My husband and<br/>\ni don&#39;t cut each other, or the kids off in conversation, but they<br/>\ninterupt us talking constantly. When we accidently make mistakes<br/>\nagainst other people we apologize immediately. I know most of their<br/>\nbehavior must be my fault, but i can only find certain mistakes i make<br/>\nto link it to. I know i&#39;m not just horrible. I know i have to be doing<br/>\nsome things right.<br/>\nHere is an example of a normal situation that happened at my house. I<br/>\nbought my kids big plastic magnifying glasses and a bug house, so they<br/>\ncould observe bugs. A couple weeks later i found one of the magnifying<br/>\nglasses destroyed in the backyard. This really upset me. I asked my<br/>\nolder son who broke it, and he said that he and his borther had. I<br/>\nasked why. He said he didn&#39;t know why. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to be able to<br/>\nlook at bugs?&quot; i asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Well then, why did you break<br/>\nyour magnifying glass?&quot; i asked. &quot; I don&#39;t know,&quot; he replied again.<br/>\n&quot;Okay, well this really upsets me, i don&#39;t buy you things just so you<br/>\ncan break them, you need to learn to think before you do things, do<br/>\nyou want to just not have things, cause when you break your stuff you<br/>\njust won&#39;t have any stuff, you&#39;re grounded.&quot; Then he proceeds to throw<br/>\na tantrum because i told him he was grounded from his playstation for<br/>\nthe rest of the day. I tell him if he wants to throw a fit he can go<br/>\nin his room and do it or get in time out. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be<br/>\ngrounded!&quot; he&#39;s yelling repeatedly. &quot;Well i&#39;m sorry, but if you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to be grounded then don&#39;t break your stuff on purpose,&quot; i say. It<br/>\ngoes on and on until i&#39;m telling him to get in time out because he<br/>\nwon&#39;t calm down or go in his room. When my children refuse to get in<br/>\ntime out we count to three. If we get to three before they move that&#39;s<br/>\nwhen we spank. I don&#39;t see how i&#39;m handling this situation<br/>\nincorrectly. I explain why he shouldn&#39;t break his stuff, i explain how<br/>\nit makes me feel, i listen to his feelings of not wanting to be<br/>\npunished, but then tell him i understand his feelings, and that<br/>\nthrough different actions he could have avoided that consequence.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that teaching them to be responsible for their actions? And had<br/>\ni asked him to pick up the broken pieces on the ground he would have<br/>\ntried to refuse doing that unless i had threatened him more. Obviously<br/>\ni&#39;m making mistakes, i just don&#39;t understand what they are or what to<br/>\ndo instead.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25153,"nextTopicId":25203}}
