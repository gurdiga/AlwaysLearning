Of course he knew my mom would be the kind of mom who would accept that<br/>\nas when we started dating he took my mom to lunch to ask her permission and talk to her since he was older and I was still 17.<br/>\nHe asked me if I wanted him to talk to my mom a out taking me to a doctor so we could start having sex but I was OK doing it.<br/>\nSo my mom took me and I knew I could really on my mom for anything I needed and to talk about <br/>\nanything over.<br/>\nIt was awesome having a mom like that. I am lucky she could be the partner I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Leah Little &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leahrlittle@...\">leahrlittle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, August 11, 2008 1:31:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Arbitrary rules are uncomfortable to face<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Too many young couples are arbitrarily separated.

In light of our examining other arbitrary rules, she <br/>\nbrought this one to my attention.  I&#39;ve always told her it&#39;s not <br/>\nproper for girls and boys to do sleepovers.  She started asking about <br/>\nthat when she was in elementary school.  She had boy friends as well <br/>\nas girl friends and she has never understood why they should be <br/>\ntreated differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she got older and had official boyfriends, I felt even more <br/>\nstrongly about the idea that they would be in a bedroom alone at any <br/>\ntime of day. I laughed when she told me how ridiculous that was <br/>\nbecause if I was worried about sex, they could do that kind of stuff <br/>\nanywhere and didn&#39;t need a bed.  As I agreed, I relaxed and Claire <br/>\nand her boyfriends often hung out in her room alone, but I still felt <br/>\nuncomfortable at the idea of a sleepover.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked me very direct questions about why her boyfriend couldn&#39;t <br/>\nspend the night.  She helped me realize that I trust her and she <br/>\nmakes good decisions and that being alone for several hours in the <br/>\nday was no different than being alone several hours in the night.  It <br/>\nbasically came down to my excuse of... but it&#39;s just not proper and <br/>\nnot socially acceptable.  Argh.  For me, this really is another <br/>\narbitrary rule that I&#39;ve had to face, conquer and let go.  Claire <br/>\nfound it amusing that I&#39;m a parent who can discuss hard topics like <br/>\nsex with my children quite easily and without embarrassment, yet the <br/>\nidea of a guy sleeping over made me cringe.  I told her it&#39;s probably <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s my baby and watching her transition into an adult is an <br/>\nending of something for me.  I&#39;ve got to focus on the beginning for <br/>\nher instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37072,"nextTopicId":37123}}
