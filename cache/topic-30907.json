While I like my <br/>\ndd&#39;s creative endeavours, I knew we would get a negative reaction <br/>\nfrom some of the people I had wanted to show it to.  Well, once I <br/>\nfigured that out my brain grew a little more and I saw how ridiculous <br/>\nthat thought process was.  I know how bad I feel when I get a <br/>\nnegative reaction, and I didn&#39;t want that to happen to my daughter, <br/>\nor me.  So I gave her the negative reaction.  This is so stupid.  <br/>\nI am her defender of negativity, and if she gets any negativity <br/>\nthrown her way I will champion her efforts - loudly, proudly, <br/>\nenthusiastically.  <br/>\nThe upside of it, is that I&#39;ve learned a lot.  I&#39;m changing my <br/>\nstatement about wanting to control that initial negative reaction <br/>\nto &quot;I want to change that initial negative reaction.&quot;  I didn&#39;t think <br/>\nit was possible because it felt so out of control, but it is <br/>\npossible.  <br/>\nIt made me think about how tired I get of the &quot;devil&#39;s advocates&quot; in <br/>\nmy life.  I would love to hear someone say &quot;Gee, what a great idea, <br/>\nAmy!&quot; once in awhile.  At 36 years old, I still get really hurt by <br/>\nother people&#39;s negativity.  I would feel awful if someone criticized <br/>\nmy artwork, or yelled at me for breaking or spilling something.  My <br/>\ndd must feel so much worse when that happens.  Knowing this makes it <br/>\neasy to change.  <br/>\nAnother thing I thought of is that unschooling isn&#39;t much different <br/>\nthan taking care of my grandmother.  I constantly made different <br/>\nkinds of food that I thought she might like because I just wanted her <br/>\nto eat.  I called her friends because I thought she might like <br/>\ncompany.  If she wanted to do anything, I dropped what I was doing <br/>\nand we did it because I wanted her to be happy.  If she made a mess?  <br/>\nI  comforted her and happily cleaned it up.  I didn&#39;t even have to <br/>\nthink about it, it&#39;s just what felt right.<br/>\nThanks to all of you for your pats on the back and advice and <br/>\ncreative ideas.  I am making lots of better choices, in taking better <br/>\ncare of myself and in being a better person to my girl.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~amy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":176439663,"authorName":"kacsshultz","from":"&quot;kacsshultz&quot; &lt;kashultz@...&gt;","profile":"kacsshultz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: getting irritated","postDate":"1191598153","msgId":30971,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlNWw4OStwOW5lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30968,"nextInTopic":30973,"prevInTime":30970,"nextInTime":30972,"topicId":30907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Over the last 3-4 years, I&#39;ve definitely had some  <br/>\ninstances where I&#39;ve had reactions and not seen the potential.  They  <br/>\nare getting to be less and less frequent, hopefully non-existent soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thread reminded me of a transition that has happened for us, and  <br/>\nof course, I credit unschooling as the reason it did.  Several years  <br/>\nago, we might have been very traditional parents, very concerned with  <br/>\nour things and protecting them.  But as time went on, and we began to  <br/>\nsay yes to more and more of the things the kids wanted to do, we  <br/>\nbegan to stretch our limits.  When we stretched our limits, we began  <br/>\nto see that the boundaries for creativity and experience are so much  <br/>\ngreater than what we would have allowed as traditional parents.  We  <br/>\nwere always interested in being creative with our children, and  <br/>\nhaving fun with them, but there were more instances where we would  <br/>\nhave an automatic no.  With practice saying yes to things that might  <br/>\nseem initially destructive or wasteful of a resource, we saw the  <br/>\npotential, and eventually began to encourage and participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerfect example, on our middle daughter&#39;s 4th birthday, I bought some  <br/>\nof the shredded tissue confetti.  Not sure what we were going to do  <br/>\nwith it, but it was pretty and we decided that we wanted it when we  <br/>\nwent through the party store.  On the morning of her birthday, she  <br/>\nand her older sister absolutely ecstatically scattered it throughout  <br/>\nour ENTIRE apartment on the floor.  (Not necessarily destructive, but  <br/>\ndefinitely very very messy, and we are still finding those little  <br/>\nthings to this day.)  Craig and I both gulped a little bit, but then  <br/>\nrealized that it was so festive, that it was the best idea anyone  <br/>\ncould have come up with.  The next year, she wanted to have a &quot;sea&quot;  <br/>\ntheme for her birthday, so we made some really cute fish decorations  <br/>\nand it was OUR idea to shred a ream of yellow construction paper to  <br/>\nspread on the floor so it could be &quot;sand.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are numerous other projects where I&#39;ve had that initial &quot;hmmm,  <br/>\nnow what do you need the whatchamacallit for???&quot; and then I realize  <br/>\nthat my children are doing something that is so creative that I am  <br/>\ntotally amazed.  Tape creations, foil contraptions, boxes of rice to  <br/>\nplay in on the kitchen floor (and elsewhere), potions in the bathroom  <br/>\n(with my stuff, as well as stuff that I buy for them), rock/funnel  <br/>\nwater filters, you name it.  If you shut it down, though, it&#39;s not  <br/>\ngoing to happen, and how will that limit your daughter&#39;s potential.   <br/>\nWhat avenue will you close off permanently, because of an early &quot;no,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s going to ruin something, or use it wastefully?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can have a whole bunch of possessions, and you will live your  <br/>\nlife and die and they will just be the stuff that you had, or, you  <br/>\ncan have possessions with memories.  We may have crazy dangly things  <br/>\nhanging from our shelves that other people don&#39;t think are  <br/>\ndecorative, collages on the wall, or cat-food cakes in my best cake  <br/>\npans cooling on the kitchen counter, but there are memories now  <br/>\nattached to those things that are so precious that they outweigh  <br/>\nanything that we used to think or feel about protecting the stuff.   <br/>\nThose cake pans are now the cake pans that Amelia made her many cat- <br/>\nfood (and other concoction) cakes in, which is so much more memorable  <br/>\nthan what I might do with them.  Of course, there is a need to help  <br/>\nyour daughter understand and respect where the real limits are for  <br/>\nthe rental property that you are inhabiting, but it is possible for  <br/>\nyou to do that gently and with an eye to identifying really great  <br/>\nalternatives to what she might suggest, if it seems destructive to  <br/>\nthe property.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that you are on the right track by realizing the mistake  <br/>\nseconds after you get mad.  Maybe your next step would be to try to  <br/>\ncatch yourself in mid-sentence.  Then the next step might be to  <br/>\nanticipate a &quot;situation.&quot;  After that, you&#39;ll probably be identifying  <br/>\nopportunities for your daughter yourself.  You already went out of  <br/>\nyour way to get her the horse that she would love, and others have  <br/>\npointed out how to look at her artistic expression with it  <br/>\ndifferently. The caring is there, maybe just changing the habit of  <br/>\nhow you react, and allowing yourself to slow down some and allow the  <br/>\nyes or positive thought to come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that it is helpful to do the work on yourself and what  <br/>\nis causing you to &quot;be&quot; a certain way.  Irritability in a toddler or  <br/>\nchild has a cause, and sometimes it is the situation, sometimes it is  <br/>\na more underlying reason (food, sleep, boredom, lack of attention).   <br/>\nI think that it can be the same way with adults.  I know that I&#39;ve  <br/>\nhad situations where something else has irritated me, and then I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen irritable with my family, misdirecting the negative energy.  Or,  <br/>\nwe try to fit too much in during a day, and then it might kind of  <br/>\ncollapse at the end, because I&#39;m tired, hungry, thirsty, etc.  It  <br/>\nalways helps to sit back and do some analysis on myself.  Sometimes  <br/>\npainful, but always helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 1, 2007, at 8:47 PM, Amy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I really love these.<br/>\n&gt; Seconds after I get mad because something bothers me I realize that I<br/>\n&gt; like what she does (or at the very least, don&#39;t mind - but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; working on being more positive than just &#39;not minding&#39;) and I am<br/>\n&gt; unsure why I get mad.

Almost a permanent fixture in a house a door<br/>\nis...right? And all the bedroom doors faced the living room and dining room<br/>\n(open room concept) so it was in full view of any future guests. For a split<br/>\nsecond, I thought to stop the painting. Thankfully, I let that thought go<br/>\nand went full-board into support mode. I told my dear son how I loved the<br/>\nchanges he was making to his door. I pleasantly noticed the colors he was<br/>\nchoosing and the design. Soon he got to a point where he couldn&#39;t reach<br/>\nhigher on the door, and standing on a chair wasn&#39;t working, so I asked him<br/>\nif he&#39;d like me to take it off the hinges and lay it down like a canvas.<br/>\nWell, let me tell you that was exciting. Soon all four kids&#39; bedroom doors<br/>\nwere laid out in different places inside and outside of the house, paint<br/>\nbuckets and brushes everywhere, as they all created away. Once the other<br/>\nthree saw what their brother was doing, they all wanted to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur living room was much more interesting and colorful with our new doors.<br/>\nMost guests *got* us pretty quickly when entering our house, and most<br/>\nadmired the kids&#39; doors and various other things around the house. My<br/>\ndaughter, who is now 15, just brought this memory up a couple months ago.<br/>\nShe said at the time she didn&#39;t think there was anything unusual about what<br/>\nwe did, but over the years she realized how unique our home was this way,<br/>\nand what a gift the freedom they had was, and is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just a horse when you bought it. Now it is something priceless. I bet<br/>\nwhen your daughter first eyed that horse in the shop her wheels were already<br/>\nturning with vision.

It is now a fabulous work of unique art.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will probably help your relationship if you can get past the idea that <br/>\nthis was &quot;meaningless stuff&quot; to begin with, either the horse or your <br/>\nreaction. Also that the only reason it is OK to alter the item is because it <br/>\nis hers. These ideas are still allowing you to minimize her experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis area of children&#39;s artistic creativity is one that is very close to my <br/>\nheart. Jayn is constantly altering her belongings, and it is very important <br/>\nto her that I don&#39;t merely tolerate it on the cheap stuff, but that I <br/>\nwholeheartedly embrace and support and celebrate her artistic modifications <br/>\nof her things - many of which have been purchased for just that purpose. <br/>\nSome of the dolls she wants to work on cost upwards of $50.00. However the <br/>\nprofessional repaint artists can command sums of several hundred dollars for <br/>\nfinished dolls starting with the same base doll, so in the future Jayn&#39;s <br/>\ncurrent experiments may end up being really worth it from a fiscal <br/>\nstandpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if not, it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that Jayn believes her art <br/>\nwork and her visual experiments are really important both to herself and to <br/>\nher father and I.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; if she wanted to write<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on it please use something besides face paint (because it&#39;s oily and<br/>\n&gt; will rub off on anything that touches it)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With Jayn I keep all her supplies really close and on hand. I wrote an <br/>\narticle for Connections E-zine talking about how her ideas of good organized <br/>\nstorage were different from mine. It might be better in this kind of <br/>\nsituation to go get out the other art supplies that she has and set them out <br/>\nfor her, and talk about what effect she is trying to achieve - and not <br/>\nmiminize her transformative work by calling it &quot;write on it&quot;. There are also <br/>\nspray fixatives and sealers that can go over finishes to help keep them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to another change in focus that you could try - that the <br/>\nproblem with the face paint is not that it rubs off on other stuff, but that <br/>\nit will mar the finish of the horse and ruin her hard work. This is all part <br/>\nof the idea that they see themselves shining reflected in our eyes, as Anne <br/>\nOhman has said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;that I didn&#39;t know why it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; frustrated me but it just did. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is *really* worth working out why it frustrated you - from the point of <br/>\nview that it  probably is not something superficial, but perhaps something <br/>\ngoing deep. Were you not allowed full ownership of your things when young? <br/>\nDid you have a really clear vision of this horse because it reminded you of <br/>\nsomething and you wanted to be able to consider it yours? Something else? <br/>\nPMS?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s way better to know your own triggers so that you can let go of them. <br/>\nThen your dd won&#39;t have to take on the idea that Mom gets frustrated and I <br/>\njust have to live with it. It is much better not to have to apologize, <br/>\nespecially if lurking within the apology is the pretty clear judgment that <br/>\nyou still don&#39;t like her art work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, please try and find the wonder of the work, instead of the horse <br/>\nthat was. I know you want to feel better about this and any future similar <br/>\nscenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - you might try Altered Books as an art form, either with your dd or just <br/>\non your own. It is a really good exercise in getting past the idea that <br/>\nsomething you buy is sacrosanct.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

No it isn&#39;t fun to clean<br/>\nit up, but thats why I&#39;m thinking if there was a certain horse with<br/>\nface paint area for her to go wild with it, maybe that would work for<br/>\neveryone?<br/>\nMy dd loves stuffed animals, she has quite the collection, every time<br/>\nshe gets a new one she immediately comes home and cuts all the name<br/>\ntags off, sometimes they have actual names ( like some of the Ty<br/>\nones)........anyway, I don&#39;t know why this bug me but it does. I don&#39;t<br/>\nsay anything anymore, i used to try to convince her not to do it until<br/>\nI asked why she does it and she said &quot; because real animals don&#39;t have<br/>\ntags coming out of their butts&quot;<br/>\nLOL<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211875477,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;amylizkid1@...&gt;","profile":"amylizkid1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"getting irritated","postDate":"1191121486","msgId":30907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkbjNvZSttMzBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30911,"prevInTime":30906,"nextInTime":30908,"topicId":30907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, I m having some trouble coping.

My daughter and I went to the <br/>\nthrift store because I was looking for a little table.  Instead we <br/>\nfound a fabulous horse.  No biggie, the table can wait.  The trouble is <br/>\nthat when we got home she cut off its mane and rubbed face paint all <br/>\nover the horse.  No, that&#39;s not the trouble.  The trouble is that it <br/>\nmade me really mad.  I was mad because I really had to scrounge and <br/>\nnegotiate to get it and I felt like she just couldn&#39;t wait to ruin it.  <br/>\nIt was such a nice horse.  I know that this wasn&#39;t what she was <br/>\nthinking, and I know that it&#39;s hers to do with what she wants.  I want <br/>\nto know how I can work on not having this knee-jerk reaction where I <br/>\nget so mad over such meaningless stuff.  I feel like most of the time I <br/>\ndo pretty good with these situations.  But sometimes I just lose it.  I <br/>\ndid tell her I was sorry, that it was hers, that if she wanted to write <br/>\non it please use something besides face paint (because it&#39;s oily and <br/>\nwill rub off on anything that touches it)and that I didn&#39;t know why it <br/>\nfrustrated me but it just did.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n~amy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30959,"nextTopicId":30975}}
