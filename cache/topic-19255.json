I have two<br/>\nkids, and one, Thomas, has these tendancies that<br/>\nschools label as problems, and he is SO into tv and<br/>\nmovies that he has wanted to be a director for three<br/>\nyears now.  He&#39;s passionate about it.  My other son,<br/>\nAlex, is very calm, patient, loves puzzles, plays<br/>\nmusical instruments, etc.  He loves to watch movies<br/>\ntoo, but not nearly as much.  He can take it or leave<br/>\nit most days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth boys have had identical mainly non-restricted<br/>\naccess to tv, in fact Alex even more so than Thomas. <br/>\nThomas is so very sensative that we learned to filter<br/>\nhis programming access when he was too little to be<br/>\ndiscerning on his own, as what he was watching was<br/>\nhaving a very profound impact on his behavior and<br/>\nhappiness.  He just could not say no for himself to<br/>\nANY tv or movies.  Now he&#39;s old enough to get<br/>\ninformation about a program beforehand and decide for<br/>\nhimself, or to watch and bit of something and tell us<br/>\nit&#39;s not for him.  With Alex, on the other hand, he<br/>\ncould always watch pretty much anything and shrug it<br/>\noff or ignore it if he didn&#39;t care for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Our brains actually are kind of flexible so that <br/>\n&gt;they can be tailored or adapted to the environment<br/>\n&gt;that we live in.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an understatement.  Our brains are extremely<br/>\nflexible.  It&#39;s not only reasonable, it&#39;s obvious, to<br/>\nassume to we are shaped by our environments, in my<br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Probably all the best pilots and air traffic<br/>\n&gt;controlers in the year 2050 will have to grow up<br/>\n&gt;playing videogames to have the synapses they need to <br/>\n&gt;run the computer consoles that they work at.<br/>\n&gt;Betsy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fascinating idea, and also seems quite plausible,<br/>\ngiven how plugged in we are getting and the increasing<br/>\ncomplexity of our tools.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You might wonder that if a trained, expert, certified<br/>\n&gt;teacher can&#39;t be at least as interesting as a TV<br/>\n&gt;program, the problem isn&#39;t with TV or the kid but in<br/>\n&gt;the belief kids need to pay attention to boring,<br/>\n&gt;blathering drones in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s also likely that tv, video games and<br/>\nother modern media are such a sensory barrage for some<br/>\nof us (like me) that we learn to dial down our<br/>\nreceptivity levels if we can, so that it takes more<br/>\nflash and more zing to reach us and we are not<br/>\ndrowning in input.  In which case the school officials<br/>\nare trying to reach us through a &quot;cone of silence&quot;<br/>\nthat we have built around ourselves.  It&#39;s either<br/>\nthat, or there are so many other people in class and<br/>\nother noises and so forth that we just can&#39;t focus on<br/>\nwhat one person is doing/saying.  For those of us who<br/>\nare more easily overwhelmed by sensory input, it can<br/>\nbe exceedingly difficult to selectively filter.  For<br/>\nmyself, I either have to &quot;turn the volume down&quot; on all<br/>\nthe input and end up seeming kind of spacey, or else<br/>\nlimit my time in very stimulating environments (such<br/>\nas with lots of people and activity etc around- like<br/>\nschool, or the supermarket) to bits and bites that I<br/>\ncan handle before feeling buried under an avalanche of<br/>\ninput.  It&#39;s self defense.<br/>\n<br/>\n.....&gt;school officials who overwhelmingly suffer from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;reasoning deficit disorder - a condition caused by<br/>\n&gt;school attendance.   <br/>\n&gt;Deb <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HA!
