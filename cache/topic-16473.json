Especially <br/>\nones a bit older than your kids.  Seeing live unschoolers in action worked <br/>\nwonders on convincing my husband.  He could also probably used a reading list <br/>\nrequrirement before he butts in, but that depends entirely on your relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the nicest things my husband said to me yesterday was &quot;I was reading <br/>\nHolt again this morning...&quot;  I think he was reading How Children Fail and went <br/>\non to talk about how Holt hit the nail on the head about teaching math - all <br/>\nthose numbers being silly symbols unless they are related to something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my husband, the converstion happened in three months.  Our kids were <br/>\nonly 2 and 3, so it was easier because he hadn&#39;t yet bought into the system of <br/>\nschool.  Good luck with yours, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s able to stay home with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160668823,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;llists@...&gt;","profile":"lyndamhoward","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"stay at home dads - advice please","postDate":"1064826312","msgId":16473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzAwMWMzODY2OCRlYmNkN2ZlMCQwZTAwMDAwYUBzbmExMjM0NTY3ODk+","referencesHeader":"PDE3Yi4yMDEwNDdjZi4yY2E0YjIwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16475,"prevInTime":16472,"nextInTime":16474,"topicId":16473,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"DH is leaving his job to retrain as an accountant & will be studying from home, working on our business and spending more time with our children.

He only has 2 more days at work left now & I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about how he&#39;s going to fit in with our unstructured structure, iyswim. We&#39;re long overdue for a holiday, so I&#39;m going to book a last minute thing. Last night we were talking about where we were going over tea & he tried to set homework for it!!! He&#39;s says he&#39;s behind the autonomous way of doing things, but I don&#39;t think he quite understands how it *actually* works day to day. lol  Suggestions please for how I can help make the transition go smoothly for all of us? I know he&#39;d get there under his own steam eventually, but I&#39;d like to minimise the disruption to everyone else whilst he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.unschooling.co.uk ~ UK unschooling forums<br/>\nwww.freerangekids.co.uk ~ bringing brighter bottoms to UK babies<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16418,"nextTopicId":16478}}
