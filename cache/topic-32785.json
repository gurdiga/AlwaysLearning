My name is Heather.  I have 2 young boys<br/>\nages 9 and 3 and another boy due in July.  I am married to the live of<br/>\nmy life, TJ (we met at age 12   vomit now  it&#39;s one of those<br/>\ndisgusting fairy tale stories LOL).  Together we live in VT with our<br/>\nPuggle, Linky Soda, and Josie the Pusseycat.  I love politics and<br/>\npainting, the boys enjoy sports and video games and cooking, and my<br/>\nhusband, while a mild mannered IT professional by day, is a superhero<br/>\nhusband by night.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling since early 2006 and making our way toward<br/>\npeaceful parenting shortly thereafter.  Both my husband and I were<br/>\nraised in very coercive and controlling environments and have found<br/>\nmuch solace in raising our children the way we always wanted to be<br/>\nraised.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also co-moderate a group on MySpace with my friend Tara which has<br/>\nalso turned me into an advice giver instead of receiver.  There are so<br/>\nmany things I am well versed in, but there is so much more to learn,<br/>\nexperience, know, so while I grow here, maybe I&#39;ll be helping others<br/>\ngrow there.  &#61514;  One of those things is message board clarity!  I can&#39;t<br/>\ncount how many times I have been misunderstood.  Moving on<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my friend Tara sent me the link to this group, I hesitated. <br/>\nBecause the LAST thing I needed was MORE emails, from MORE yahoo<br/>\ngroups!  However, I am already enjoying the conversations I am<br/>\nreading.  I definitely look for a lot personal exchange of support on<br/>\nmessage boards, since I have a lack of support of other radical<br/>\nunschooling families here.  There are other unschoolers, but I would<br/>\nsay unschooling in the &quot;no curriculum&quot; sort of way.  Not necessarily<br/>\nthe parenting sort of way.  (Well, that I can tell anyway.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe issues that pop up most around here are sibling rivalry, chaos in<br/>\nthe house, and some real combative behavior from my three year old<br/>\n(I&#39;m thinking he might become a boxer &lt;G&gt;).  My children are<br/>\nhigh-spirited and my oldest has been giving me a run for my money<br/>\nsince birth!  I&#39;m so glad to have found this lifestyle that enabled me<br/>\nto reconnect with him.  Our lives have never been the same since! <br/>\nThen, pregnancy has sort of added in an irritability factor that I<br/>\nthought I had gotten rid of!  So I come to the boards looking for that<br/>\nno-nonsense, kick my rear end advice that I know I can&#39;t get anywhere<br/>\nelse!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I think that&#39;s enough for now!  I look forward to future exchanges<br/>\nwith all of you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32764,"nextTopicId":32792}}
