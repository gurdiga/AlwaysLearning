Their<br/>\nprevious attempt at homeeducation hadn&#39;t flown.   I shared my story,  our<br/>\nkids went back and forth a bit, and then suggested she check out different<br/>\nmethods of homeeducation.   Gave her some links--to unschooling.com and<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat same day I got a couple off list e-mails asking me about unschooling<br/>\nand also had 3 people join my unschooling list!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days though that I do feel like its an uphill battle,  like when I<br/>\nread posts(on the homeschooling list)  from people who are on my unschooling<br/>\nlist,  and they are doing their &#39;schooling&#39;.   Ugh!  That&#39;s why noone is<br/>\nsharing with me what they&#39;re up to!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17051,"nextTopicId":17102}}
