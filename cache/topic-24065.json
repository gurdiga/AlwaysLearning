My wife and were playing video<br/>\ngames long before our kids came along, so for us it&#39;s something we do<br/>\ntogether.  Some families might prefer board games, while we like to<br/>\nsneak around the jungle and shoot at each other.<br/>\nMore along the lines of the question asked, though not quite, my son<br/>\ngot a real boost the first time he beat me at a game.  I&#39;ve used that<br/>\nas an example to him when he felt something might be too big a<br/>\nchallenge or too hard for him.  After many attempts at riding his bike<br/>\nfor example, he complained that it was too hard.  I could tell that he<br/>\nwanted to figure it out, and I could see that he was on the verge of<br/>\nthat click where the balance and speed all come together.  So I<br/>\nreminded him of the time when he never beat me at Tony Hawk.  Then he<br/>\nbegan to beat me pretty regularly and actually made me work at it. <br/>\nAll he had done, I reminded him, was to keep trying, to keep doing his<br/>\nbest.<br/>\nRight now, it&#39;s cold and a little ick outside.  He&#39;s got all day to<br/>\nconfront his current video game interest, Twisted Metal 4.  His goal<br/>\nis to beat the game with individual characters in order to open the<br/>\nfilms about each character.  So maybe he&#39;s learning to set goals, to<br/>\nfollow through and to work hard for something you find valuable.  Or<br/>\nmaybe he just loves blowing things up.<br/>\nFor me personally, there isn&#39;t really any &quot;learning&quot; more important<br/>\nthan the fun I have playing video games with my son or my wife.  Buy<br/>\nextra controllers and multiplayer games.  Parents should take their<br/>\nown turn playing the games.  That&#39;s the best experience in<br/>\nunderstanding them.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Game List","postDate":"1137266204","msgId":24067,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2OTdBODkzLTFEMEUtNEIyQy05QjlGLTA2RDZERTM4MUQwQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDYwMWM2MTkzNSRhOGU1Nzk1MCQwYTAwYThjMEBzb3V0aHN5c3RlbXM+","referencesHeader":"PDExMzcyMjMzMjQuMjExNi41MjMxMC5tMjZAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA0NjAxYzYxOTM1JGE4ZTU3OTUwJDBhMDBhOGMwQHNvdXRoc3lzdGVtcz4="},"prevInTopic":24066,"nextInTopic":24069,"prevInTime":24066,"nextInTime":24068,"topicId":24065,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just thought of where this might exist: -=-I was wondering if there was a list of video games and computer games where it notes what most school families","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1168615898\">I just thought of where this might exist:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I was wondering<br/>\nif there was a list of video games and computer games where it notes  <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nmost &quot;school&quot; families would consider the games benefits.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nScholastic Books has a computer games subdivision.
