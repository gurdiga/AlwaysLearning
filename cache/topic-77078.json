And again. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">I&#39;ve been reading on this list for about 5 years, and I&#39;m embarrassed to admit I didn&#39;t fully apply unschooling principles to my husband and my marriage until the past year or so. I&#39;d thought I tried in the past, but I&#39;d too easily slip back into my tendency to be controlling and critical. Finally something really clicked in me, and I was able to see my sensitive, sweet, vulnerable husband and the ways in which I was making our relationship unsafe for him. I looked more closely at the things I thought I wanted to say, and applied more stringent criteria to my words, which eliminated my nagging and complaining almost completely. I voiced my appreciation for the things I noticed he was good at - he&#39;s a wonderful dad who plays just like a little kid, way better than I do. I adjusted my narrative that said &quot;I do everything around here&quot; and noticed (just to myself as to avoid condescension since things were still pretty imbalanced) the ways he lessened my burdens, and I reinforced my own sense of gifting my family with my &quot;chores&quot;. I stopped openly questioning (which he saw as criticizing) things he did that I didn&#39;t get or seemed like a waste of time and instead tried to make his ability to do those things easier and more comfortable. After all, there are many things I do that are important to me that he doesn&#39;t understand but he doesn&#39;t walk by and sigh about all the time I&#39;m wasting. He&#39;s more likely to make a lighthearted joke than to be critical - something I have learned from him. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">My husband and I have been together 18 years, married 11, and for many years, any time we argued or were in a rough patch I fantasized about the marriage I wished I had and the husband I wanted. I finally made the shift to becoming the wife I want to be. And my husband has noticed and our relationship has improved immensely. We still have plenty of issues, like any couple, some still serious (like the drinking problem) but because I stopped picking at him and have truly accepted him for who he is - not in some distant better future, but today - we can talk openly, without him being defensive, about the things that really do need to change. He feels accepted now, despite imperfections. And because I now only address what is important, not merely what I find annoying, he hears me and responds. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">One of the things that has helped me keep perspective is to keep my daughter&#39;s peace and happiness at the very top of my priorities. No matter what, that means her family will stay intact. Not only because that means I don&#39;t have to worry about protecting her from in-laws I don&#39;t trust, but because she loves her dad and me above all else, and no amount of explanation about my personal needs could justify tearing her world apart. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">To sum up, the most important step I took towards happiness (in marriage, in life) was to let go of fantasies and expectations about what happiness looks like, and to make my life in all its messiness the best in any given moment by shifting into gratitude and joy in every moment I can. That alone has shifted my family to a better place. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">No marriage is beyond fixing. I still think you can&#39;t save it by yourself if your partner has given up, but you can make it better and he might change his mind. </span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">cheri</span></div><div><br></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Marriage problem assistance","postDate":"1464230832","msgId":77117,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMwNjRCNTRBLTMwNTYtNDA5MC1CN0FDLTY3NTU0ODQwMEYxN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTk1qNFl1ekFyY25vPV9xcGV1SGtMd25Rb3R0TnB5eG9Cd2VtT3NRVUI1ZF9tU2FIUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEyMzQ1NjEwODQuMTYxMTI2My4xNDY0MDY3MDIzMDU5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0FOTWo0WXV6QXJjbm89X3FwZXVIa0x3blFvdHROcHl4b0J3ZW1Pc1FVQjVkX21TYUhRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77116,"nextInTopic":77124,"prevInTime":77116,"nextInTime":77118,"topicId":77078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What Erin wrote was wonderful, and I wanted to save some of it somewhere (which I have done without attaching her name, because Google is too bright a light","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-744711542\">What Erin wrote was wonderful, and I wanted to save some of it somewhere (which I have done without attaching her name, because Google is too bright a light sometimes).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing she wrote, I wanted to connect to something similar.  <br/>\n<br/>\n“See the scared lonely child in him that is pushing away reminders of his failure to be what he thought he should be and help him to see every way that he is a success, he probably can&#39;t see them on his own anymore.”<br/>\n<br/>\nSO BIG, so important.

Although it doesn&#39;t address the issue of someone else being a part of the marriage, it might give you hope about the different stages of a long term relationship. The marriage therapist who wrote the book (after working with thousands of couples) talks about how hardship in marriage is necessary to evolve the relationship and ourselves as individuals, and it&#39;s completely normal, there is nothing like marriage (maybe parenting too) that provides that opportunity for growth, but we must be prepared to grow and be ok with being completely out of our comfort zone while we do (it sounds like you are definitely there!). </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">Giving up is really just losing opportunities for him and you to keep growing. There is some other great thoughts in the book and I found it gave me a whole different perspective on marriage that was helpful, I&#39;ve stopped fighting for change in my marriage, accepted that my husband is the right man for me (otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have got together 16 years ago), and started working on myself. </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alturtle.com\">www.alturtle.com</a></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">With that in mind, the website above is one I&#39;ve found useful. The first page has some easy links you can click on to get you started that may be applicable to your situation. The website focuses on how you can improve to be a better partner rather than trying to change your husband. If you raise the bar on communication, boundaries, patience, empathy etc, then he might raise his own bar.  </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">There is nothing more attractive to a man at the end of the day than a mother dedicated to raising his offspring right, if you keep focusing on doing that for your children you will be a woman that cannot be replaced (which you can&#39;t be anyway, you are the only mother to his children), he may wake up to that eventually.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">Does he listen to podcasts or read books? There are a few great intellectual philosophy podcasts that he could plug into if he&#39;s bored at home, he could listen while he goes about the day with the children, that may take his mind to new heights. It sounds like he is relying on the other woman outside of the marriage to help him with his feelings of worthlessness and perhaps anxiety.  </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">The &quot;having nothing in common&quot; reason and getting a new girlfriend sounds to me like someone going through a midlife crisis. He is young at 30, his parents divorce must be traumatic, the move to a new country and the feelings of responsibility to you and the children at 30 years old (while probably some of his friends are just having fun without commitments) , and being down on himself sounds like a recipe for a personal crisis. It would be so beneficial if he could see a therapist, or at least have some good friends who give wise advice and speak truthfully.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">My husband instigated a seperation  after 10 years of marriage, I accepted it reluctantly thinking it was the only way to get clarity over some of the transitional problems we were facing at the time (one was leaving the religious group we were apart of all our lives), some of the reasons your husband mentions in his rationalising for leaving his family sound familiar. Our separation only ended up lasting 6 months before we both realised nothing could replace what we were building together and how much we loved our children,  that realisation came through our experiences in that 6 months as well as finding some wise advice (like this group!) . However, we had to search for the good advice, our friends/family more or less supported our decision to separate which is quite bizarre looking back, as they were all there when we made our marriage vowels to each other. In this world of political correctness a lot of people are afraid of saying anything that may offend and would rather watch people&#39;s lives fall apart than be truthful about what feels like a wrong decision, and what will so obviously not bring lasting joy long term.  When there is no abuse, it is a family being together that will bring the most happiness in life, and there are so many articles on Sandra&#39;s site proving this and a few sad ones regretting that they knew it. </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">My final thoughts are to live with integrity to yourself and to your role as a mother. Try not to worry about you husband&#39;s process of growth so much, give him your suggestions if he asks (eg a good book you read or podcast) but go about quietly if he doesn&#39;t and work on yourself to get a greater understanding of your situation and of course focus on being a great mother.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">I am married to a wonderful man who also needs his space when figuring things out and I&#39;m only realising this after 16 years together :-/ </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">I hope this gives you something to work with through this challenging time in your life.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">Sarah</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69,69,69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div></div><blockquote><div><div><div><p><br clear=\"none\">\n</p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:rgb(255,255,255);min-height:0px;\"></div></div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n            </blockquote></div></blockquote></div><p></p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:rgb(255,255,255);min-height:0px;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br></span></blockquote></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky","from":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Marriage problem assistance","postDate":"1464212539","msgId":77114,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFENTdCQTNGLUI5MzUtNDg0MC04RUVBLTJDREJDNzM2NEY0OUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG5pNHNmZSsxam9nbTA2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG5pNHNmZSsxam9nbTA2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77113,"nextInTopic":77115,"prevInTime":77113,"nextInTime":77115,"topicId":77078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Same at my house.

The father of my children got into a downward spiral of drinking and drugs in the last years of our marriage. He was arrested twice while caring for the children while I was at work, once while driving under the influence of alcohol, with my children who were 21/2 and 5 years old at the time, in the car. Alcoholism affects everyone in a family. My denial that my husband&#39;s drinking was a problem and his shame and outright lying about whether he was drinking or using drugs put my children in very dangerous situations. He is in recovery now and when he is sober, enjoys spending with the children in my presence or with a family member. His sobriety is and must be a precursor to his involvement with the kids, and I spent 7 years in Al-Anon before I had the strength to stand up for myself and my kids and a home life where I can feel safe. I know divorce is not for everyone, but with two adults, I think it does take two to make a partnership like marriage work.

What I do know is alcoholic behavior is bad for children - it&#39;s confusing, destabilizing, potentially dangerous. My husband has a drinking problem, and grew up with an alcoholic mother (who still drinks). He and I have had many conversations about how confusing and hurtful his mother was, and how it only made sense when he grew up and realized it was the alcohol (understanding merely clears up the confusion, not the pain). It is extremely important to me that our daughter not experience that, but my declarations of my intent were not being heard and his drinking continued. Recently my daughter and I took a trip while my husband stayed home and I left him a letter saying (amongst many other things, including the multitude of reasons I love him) if he is unwilling to choose between his family and his addiction I&#39;m prepared to force his hand. I would generally recommend against saying something like that, but I chose to for several reasons: he&#39;s been trying to moderate his drinking for years without success, we&#39;ve been to marriage counseling twice in about 10 years with his drinking as one of the central issues, and a few weeks ago he hurt our daughter in a way that wouldn&#39;t have happened if he was sober (nothing serious, didn&#39;t leave a mark, but still . . . ) and I thought that would be enough to knock sense into him and it wasn&#39;t, and I know she and I are the most important things in his world. So I used our experience together and what I know about him to move towards a resolution to our problem, and so far it&#39;s working. If his drinking becomes problematic again my daughter and I will take a trip without him for as long as it takes for him to clean up his act. Like I said, not something I&#39;d recommend, but it&#39;s what can work in our situation. I&#39;m looking at him, me, our daughter, and trying to figure out what is best. Your situation will necessarily dictate other options.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One of the reasons working through marital problems, regardless of the kind, can be a good choice is because generally people bring those same problems into the next relationship. What you said about seeing/hearing the same words he wrote to you shows he&#39;s repeating a pattern, looking for something outside to fill the hole inside. Someone, I think Sandra, posted a really great link to AlTurtle.com, a treasure trove of articles about making relationships work. One of the most helpful things I read was how our family relationships with parents set us up with areas of lack (unconditional love is rare) that we&#39;re looking to complete through our choice of partner. With a willing partner, we can heal those old wounds and grow together. But you cannot save a marriage by yourself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If he&#39;s interested in trying to save what you have, I&#39;ve had good experience with resources from the Gottman Institute (gottman.com). Dr. Gotttman has done many longitudinal studies on couples and has real information about what makes marriage work and what will surely kill it. Many years ago my husband and I attended a Gottman weekend workshop that gave us knowledge and skills we still use. You can buy a DVD version of the workshop through the website. It includes concrete exercises that help elicit empathy, understanding, and movement towards a better relationship. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think it would help to put more attention on what he does/who he is that makes you smile. Being a dad. Making a joke or witty comment. A quirky expression. See him through your children&#39;s eyes - who is he to them?</div><div><br></div><div>I know when I&#39;m in a place where I&#39;m unhappy with my husband my sense of what I want and need can drown out other thoughts and I have a hard time feeling empathy for the difficulty my husband is having - he also struggles with depression and inactivity and a sense of failure as a person. Sometimes there&#39;s not a whole lot I can do to help, but there are many ways I can make it worse. Recognizing he doesn&#39;t want to hurt me, and that he doesn&#39;t always know how to best help himself are helpful thoughts for me to have. He&#39;s incredibly sensitive and can feel my energy and read my face, so I know my thoughts matter. Sometimes I picture him as a little kid and my heart breaks a little and softens towards him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What would it be like for you to write him a letter, sharing your thoughts, feelings, hopes and dreams?&nbsp;</div><div>I was grateful to have a trusted friend to review the letter I recently wrote my husband to make sure it lacked an attacking or hurtful tone and was open, honest, and loving. For us, this time, that tactic worked.&nbsp;</div><div>Maybe you two can have a conversation over email and figure out what you each want for your family and your future and how you can make the best life for your kids. Email will allow each of you to have space for honest emotions&nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">without feeling responsible for or reactive to the others&#39; feelings.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">Where unschooling principles can help here is to let go of expectations and really look at who is in front of you. Be open, respectful, loving, honest, and try to make it work for all of you without worrying what anyone else will think. Maybe that means an open marriage where he travels with a girlfriend and you two are friends who co-parent. Maybe that thought makes you die a little inside. No matter what, if he&#39;s not willing to engage, there&#39;s only so much you can do.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">I hope others have ideas about how unschooling principles can shed some light.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">good luck.</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">cheri</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430722916,"authorName":"","from":"mellingersa@...","profile":"mellingersa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re[2]: [AlwaysLearning] Marriage problem assi stance","postDate":"1464101826","msgId":77090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NjQxMDE4MjYuOTk5OTExNjUzQGYxNy5teS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEMyRDUxQ0FDLTcwNkYtNDU5OC04RUE3LTE4NkUwOEQwOTVEREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEMyRDUxQ0FDLTcwNkYtNDU5OC04RUE3LTE4NkUwOEQwOTVEREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77087,"nextInTopic":77091,"prevInTime":77089,"nextInTime":77091,"topicId":77078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Coming late into this discussion but since I moved to the USA in my thirties I thought I share my experience of adult incompetence in a foreign country.

Although it doesn&#39;t address the issue of someone else being a part of the marriage, it might give you hope about the different stages of a long term relationship. The marriage therapist who wrote the book (after working with thousands of couples) talks about how hardship in marriage is necessary to evolve the relationship and ourselves as individuals, and it&#39;s completely normal, there is nothing like marriage (maybe parenting too) that provides that opportunity for growth, but we must be prepared to grow and be ok with being completely out of our comfort zone while we do (it sounds like you are definitely there!). </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">Giving up is really just losing opportunities for him and you to keep growing.

It would be so beneficial if he could see a therapist, or at least have some good friends who give wise advice and speak truthfully.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">My husband instigated a seperation  after 10 years of marriage, I accepted it reluctantly thinking it was the only way to get clarity over some of the transitional problems we were facing at the time (one was leaving the religious group we were apart of all our lives), some of the reasons your husband mentions in his rationalising for leaving his family sound familiar. Our separation only ended up lasting 6 months before we both realised nothing could replace what we were building together and how much we loved our children,  that realisation came through our experiences in that 6 months as well as finding some wise advice (like this group!) . However, we had to search for the good advice, our friends/family more or less supported our decision to separate which is quite bizarre looking back, as they were all there when we made our marriage vowels to each other. In this world of political correctness a lot of people are afraid of saying anything that may offend and would rather watch people&#39;s lives fall apart than be truthful about what feels like a wrong decision, and what will so obviously not bring lasting joy long term.  When there is no abuse, it is a family being together that will bring the most happiness in life, and there are so many articles on Sandra&#39;s site proving this and a few sad ones regretting that they knew it. </div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">My final thoughts are to live with integrity to yourself and to your role as a mother. Try not to worry about you husband&#39;s process of growth so much, give him your suggestions if he asks (eg a good book you read or podcast) but go about quietly if he doesn&#39;t and work on yourself to get a greater understanding of your situation and of course focus on being a great mother.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(69, 69, 69);font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;font-size:17px;\">I am

He&#39;s not an outgoing person to begin with, so if he goes inside himself, he&#39;s *gone*. It&#39;s so deep. Years ago, with an old boyfriend, I had a very dissatisfying conversation. We were through, and I was hurt, and he was ignoring/avoiding me. I confronted him with my pain and suffering, and got...a mildly patronizing and utterly dismissive response. After I cried that off, I realized that it is never productive for me to go into a conversation because there is something I want to *hear,* or get from the other person. If I really have to put something out there, I can do it in a letter, because that prevents me from trying to elicit any particular response. I never send those letters:) </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That was the beginning of learning how to be a partner for me, I think. (The other was when a mutual friend slapped me down at a party by saying &quot;Stop emasculating your boyfriend!&quot;, because I hadn&#39;t realized that&#39;s how I was and what I was doing-it was all about me.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> My husband is much different from the dismissive ex boyfriend, but I make an effort to remember not to try to get him to talk, because he&#39;s not a talker.

If you divorce, the unschooling that you *are* able to do could really suffer, as he and his circle are not supportive. What would your life look like as a single parent? Can you construct that while he is there and see how it feels? Can you find some other support, some mom&#39;s groups, a sitter? Maybe a helper to play with the kids if he&#39;s bored? Perhaps he could travel on his own for a few months after you switch to part-time, or if you get help?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Marriage problem assistance","postDate":"1463981069","msgId":77080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyRDUxQ0FDLTcwNkYtNDU5OC04RUE3LTE4NkUwOEQwOTVEREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77079,"nextInTopic":77081,"prevInTime":77079,"nextInTime":77081,"topicId":77078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is only an illustration, and not a parallel.

This is why cultures for thousands of years have wanted people to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-807354482\">My first impressions on reading this might not be helpful, but I’ll spill them anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why cultures for thousands of years have wanted people to marry in the same religion and language, generally.  For stability for the larger family and the children.  It’s quite cool in the past 40 years for people to marry internationally.  For example,  I read that over 10% of marriages in Korea are to foreigners.  Partly (the writer said) it’s because women move to the city and men working rurally are finding wives in poorer Asian countries.  Some is because of a new wave of open-mindedness among younger people, and (incidentally, it said) mixed-race kids are beginning to be considered attractive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s brought just for an example of change—of new prejudices replacing old ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut those prejudices are usually based on some reality—that there ARE problems with raising children when the parents have different backgrounds, even when both are happy to be where they are.<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when a partner&#39;s drinking is temporarily in a lull, it will be helpful for the more sober partner to read some al-Anon literature—with young children, going to meetings isn’t going to be easy, but there will be things online, and maybe going by a place where groups meet, one could pick up some pamphlets.  At least they’ll help with suggestions of what is a waste of time and thought—what does NOT help. <br/>\n<br/>\nEliminating what makes things worse will tend to make things slightly better (or at least not much worse).<br/>\n<br/>\nAh.  There are online meetings, and there’s a tab there to literature.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://al-anon.org/electronic-meetings\">http://al-anon.org/electronic-meetings</a><br/>\n_______________________<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that sometimes is done in counselling is for each partner to describe a situation from the other partner’s point of view.  If one agreed to move to the husband’s country and then went back on that, maybe verbalizing (or writing) all of that from his point of view could either help you change you mind, or give you more empathy and maybe enough remorse to sincerely apologize. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would it take to stay together?  Moving as first promised?  Would it be easier for him to get a job “at home”?<br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about money?  How will the children change countries to visit?  Very expensive and they’re too young to travel without and adult for another ten years or more.  Maybe moving would be better.  Maybe there’s a compromise other country. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling might not work now.  The children are too young to “be unschooling” anyway, at this point, if compulsory school age hasn’t come, but if the husband and his friends and any grandparents and the new girlfriend (this one or another one) don’t get it and don’t WANT to get it, then it’s not something that can be clung to or pulled off.  The ideas can color and decorate parenting, but school without too much investment might be much more peaceful than the children feeling unaccepted for being who they are and knowing what they know, doing what they do, and being non-standard cogs in an international machine.  <br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the girlfriend could be invited to come and visit, meet the the children, talk about the possibility of cooperation.  Maybe it would cause the problem to dissipate, inviting her over.  Or maybe she’d be likeable and that would change the dynamics, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Marriage problem assistance","postDate":"1463978805","msgId":77078,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEQzc0N0RGLTgwNDMtNDkxMC1CN0JFLTJCNzc2ODNCMzY5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77079,"prevInTime":77077,"nextInTime":77079,"topicId":77078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is long, and it’s not directly about unschooling.

It was nonetheless an interesting experience to write it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy marriage is in a sad place and I have no clear idea where to start or how to continue to make it better. I know I could leave and things might be better but I know this group has always been a big advocate of trying as much as possible to stay together and this is the very reason why I appreciate comments. My children are 4 and a half and 2 years old and I have been with my husband since 2008, married in 2009. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have been having difficulties for a while and it would probably be helpful to tell the whole story, but it also long and possibly boring. To me every single piece of information is relevant but from the outside it might not be so I&#39;ll attempt to make points. I&#39;d like to keep it as anonymous as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** He studied Liberal Arts and likes writing, he&#39;s very intelligent and is able to do pretty much anything he sets his mind to but doesn&#39;t have a clear passion or profession in mind. Since I&#39;ve met him, he&#39;s been someone that thinks that the next thing is going to be better than the now, liking ideas and potentials but struggling with the day to day. He&#39;s not someone that talks about his feelings very much and has the tendency to drink a lot when things are difficult. His outlook on life is generally negative/cynical and right now he thinks he&#39;s a failure and a bad person. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****  Initially ours was a long distance relationship and we wrote to each other thousands of emails, words were everything. There was the whole of the Atlantic ocean between us but I felt a connection and a love for him I&#39;ve never felt for anybody. Eventually, when we moved in together, the written words obviously dwindled.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** He left his office job in 2009 and moved to the country where I was studying after we got married but we didn&#39;t live together straight away as he went to do a two year agriculture diploma one hour away from my flat. The idea was good but he didn&#39;t like the course or the environment so much. There were moments of darkness. In his second year I also started working as a doctor and there was a lot of travelling and commuting and lack of sleep. But things were still exciting and after the course he went back to his country to scout for a house and some land. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** When he came back we were waiting for a baby. I finished my first year and went on maternity early, so before the baby was born I did the first of the conversion exams to be able to apply for a job in his country. During the year I was at home on maternity, my husband couldn&#39;t (or didn&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure) find a job which definitely played a part on his mood. Despite thinking about being a writer, he didn&#39;t think that trying to write or get published was even a remotely possible option. But we had a baby, we were helping each other out and things didn&#39;t seem so bad. I did another of my exams when the baby was 4 months old. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** I didn&#39;t expect it but having a baby made it difficult for me to think about going back to work full time, so I went part-time when the baby was 8 months old. My husband also found a part-time job in a restaurant so we were looking after the baby together. Somehow, the idea of moving with my job to his country became too challenging, mostly because it meant for me to work 80-100 hours a week for years. There was no maternity or part-time option in his country at my level of training.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** My husband never said it but I can&#39;t help having the feeling that I kind of disappointed him, talking about moving and house and land and then not doing what I said we would. For me was more like postponing things and modifying plans, not losing dreams, but for him was yet another thing added to the list of shitty things in his life, confirming a negative outlook. A job he didn&#39;t like, a country he didn&#39;t particularly like, not going back to his country anytime soon, a baby that changed our relationship and, on top of everything, his parents decided to divorce after a 30+ year marriage. Part of the struggle was also the knowledge that, in actual facts, our life wasn&#39;t that bad: we had a healthy baby, a flat, we both had jobs and we loved each other. But the unhappiness, the discontent, the darkness were still there for him. I don&#39;t think I realised the full extent of the problem, I was excited about the baby, about parenting and unschooling ideas I&#39;d been reading about, about finding joy and wonder in each moment. I tried to share but he didn&#39;t seem to care very much. I can only imagine: I was talking about options that meant spending even more time and effort with family and children while he was struggling with the day to day. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** Talking about his parents&#39; divorce wasn&#39;t something we successfully did. I&#39;m still not sure how much he was affected by it and I also felt very affected by it, despite them not being my parents they were still part of my family. My husband said that it was their business but his relationship with his mum definitely deteriorated and trust was compromised (slightly less with his dad). <br/>\n<br/>\n***** Working in the service industry, there were even more opportunities to drink and I spent many nights being worried about him coming home or literally having to pick him up from the floor. I was scared but didn&#39;t know how to deal with it, embarrassed to talk about it with relatives and friends, a couple of times missing work because I didn&#39;t trust him with a hungover and a baby. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** In this environment we had another baby. Looking back I wonder what was going through my head. I guess I was too excited to realise the full extent of our problems, the good moments still aplenty and the relationship of my husband with the little one very good. Also I wasn&#39;t depressed and I didn&#39;t see life as bad, I was enjoying the toddler, found some very good friends and dreams where filling my head. But the pregnancy was lonely, the disconnect with my husband present. Our dreams of travelling, land, animals, community didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything for him while I was restless and ready to move. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went on maternity a couple of weeks before the baby was born and my husband started to work full time in a pub. I loved being home with both children and going out with them, seeing people and enjoying the days, somewhat letting go of the idea that we had to be somewhere else to be happy. I thought a lot about my parenting and why I did things and when to say yes and no and talking to others about how to relate to the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband didn&#39;t seem so happy about my parenting but at the same time he didn&#39;t seem to be interested in discussing why. The drunkenness made it very difficult for me to find him attractive or worth of respect, it felt like a lot of responsibilities for decisions were on my shoulders and with them the potential for mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also felt very responsible for his unhappiness and my inability to do anything about it, while at the same time realising his unhappiness went much deeper and was something beyond anything I could say and do. But still, I hadn&#39;t be able to help him as a wife. I took a lot of decisions during this time that probably weren&#39;t the best in the long run (work-wise as well). My husband seemed to prefer the lack of confrontation and the appearance of peace to real discussions about the future of our family. Actually, I don&#39;t think he could really talk or think about the future without a deep despair. He definitely felt like a failure, being 30 years old and not having a profession he thought worthy, having little money and no savings and a marriage that didn&#39;t feel like one. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** I mentioned counselling many times but he was alway adamant that there was no point and that he wouldn&#39;t do it (his experience of his parents&#39; divorce definitely playing a part). I tried to reach out and contacted one of his best friends back home, explaining about the drinking, the late nights, the sadness, my lack of helpful solutions. And his friend seemed supportive, recognising some of my struggle and wanting to help somehow. Eventually we disclosed to my husband the email conversations and our concerns but he never really discussed this with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***** A job opportunity for me arose across the world at the beginning of 2015 and we decided that it could be a good idea to start afresh. My husband never liked the country where we were and I was happy enough to try somewhere else (and going back to his country wasn&#39;t possible right away). We started the paperwork, which took ages. My husband was very discouraged and probably thought it was never going to happen. In the summer we flew to visit his family and friends. It was a strange and challenging time: his dad had moved state with work, his mum was already living with another man and his family and we were staying with them, which was definitely something my husband didn&#39;t want to do but we were only told at the last minute. Again there was a lot of drinking. After we came back I found out that a couple of my husband&#39;s best friends (including the one that I corresponded with) told him that he should just leave me because I belittle him and all his ideas, because he&#39;s an amazing person that cannot reach his potential with me and that what I was doing was basically emotional abuse. (It was interesting, as he&#39;s told me before in the emails that my husband was abusing me, with all the drinking and such.)<br/>\n<br/>\n***** It was traumatic to find this out. To even consider that I was abusing my husband. Was I? I didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do in life, he didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do in life. Over the years I tried to support his passions but it felt like he was the first not believing in himself. I definitely didn&#39;t know how to deal with the drinking and started trusting him less despite knowing he was struggling. I didn&#39;t know how to help someone that didn&#39;t seem to want to help himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been very hands on with the children, I guess my parenting is very &#39;attachment parenting&#39; style, to put a label on it. I imagine my husband friends didn&#39;t quite understand that, maybe they just thought I was obsessed with the children. From my part I can say that my relationship with the children was easier than that with my husband so it was definitely easier to relate to them and spend time with them. One of his friends (one concerned that I was &#39;ruining the children&#39;) told me he&#39;d been working with social services and troubled families in NYC and that children definitely need rules and boundaries. I didn&#39;t contradict him but I said that rules and boundaries might be effective in some circumstanced but there were different ways to related to children too. He thought I was crazy, he knew the theory. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** Back home things were stressful, our departure from the country was looming but there was no date or the date kept changing. My husband had to keep working a job he dislike when we&#39;d thought we would be gone weeks prior. I managed to go back to my country for a week with the children, to say goodbye to my family. When we returned I found out that the trip out of town my husband took to clear his head was shared with another woman. He&#39;d met someone at work after our return from the visit to his family and there was a relationship developing. There was a lot of lying, denying of a physical relationship, admitting to difficulties, to feeling the lack of purpose, feeling a lack of anything in common with me, and thinking that I didn&#39;t care anyway. He denied loving this woman and said he would never leave the children. He said other things too: that I love spending time with the children more than he does, that he would like to travel alone, that he likes spending time hanging out with friends, that we don&#39;t have anything in common anymore, that he didn&#39;t love but felt appreciated by this woman.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Eventually we moved across the world, saying we would try again for one year, start afresh and see how things went. I hadn&#39;t been working for almost 2 years and I started working full time (76 hours over two weeks). Because of visa requirements, I have to work full time for at least one year until I get my full registration as a doctor. I like my job very much but since having children and realising I loved being home with them, a full time job is a challenging experience. But without it we couldn&#39;t have moved, and without it we would have very little money. And it is possible to work part time here, just not straight away. It also means that my husband is at home with the children full time.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** To cut a long story short, I soon discovered that the relationship didn&#39;t end with our move. It carries on daily via messages, emails and calls despite him telling me many times that he&#39;s not or less in touch with her. Or that he&#39;s contacting her because he feels lonely when I&#39;m at work. I don&#39;t know why, I guess I&#39;m optimistic at heart, but every time I believed him and every time I feel trust breaks more until there&#39;s nothing left. The words I find for her written by my husband so similar to the ones that used to flow between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had conversations but we seemed to have gotten nowhere. He says that nothing is changing like it is my fault but since we moved he hasn&#39;t stopped contacting her. There&#39;s no more drinking and he&#39;s taking better care of himself but his profound unhappiness with life is ever present. He says he&#39;s a terrible person that I will not forgive and he himself cannot forgive and this seems almost to have become an excuse not to be better or change. He actually said that to make this relationship work he would have to change too much. And that the lover is not the issue because our problems are from before. He keeps saying that we have little in common apart from the children and that he&#39;s not sure staying together for them is a good decision. He&#39;s miserable and I&#39;m miserable. He feels lost and purpose-less. I&#39;ve proposed to reorganise things at work so he could find a job but he&#39;s not jumping on the possibility. I think part of him doesn&#39;t want to settle and start anything new because he&#39;s thinking to leave when the year is up and he&#39;s fulfilled this duty.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me things are confusing and not so black and white. I don&#39;t think all he is is just a terrible person. I can sense suffering, suffering that was there before his girlfriend. And I see him with the children. He looks after them, connecting with them and loving then very much. Cooking and looking after the house for us. But he finds the day to day home tedious and repetitive. I get lulled into a false sense of security when I see him playing with them and then break my heart once again when I find him referring to the other woman as &#39;my love&#39; and discussing possible option for meeting up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep trying because separating basically means he will only see the children once a year (he&#39;s likely to go back to his country) and because leaving a part of my family - especially if this part is struggling - is a terrible option. But it&#39;s come to the point where staying in this situation filled with lies is breaking me. I miss his love, I remember it being so strong. I don&#39;t understand if he&#39;s still here because he has no money, or because he doesn&#39;t want to leave the kids, or because he thinks I need help, or because he feels like a failure or is embarrassed to explain the situation to family and friends, or because in a round about way he wants to keep us together, or because he still cares a little about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is, how do you connect and keep your heart open and stay as a family when you feel all trust and love have be been shattered? How is this good for the children?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there&#39;s also a part of me that sees his suffering and his longing for this woman and this part just wants to say to him to please go, go to this love and be happy, or go travel and be happy. I feel like I&#39;ve trapped him in this life he dislikes and if I could take myself away from the picture he would finally be happy and feel less trapped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost him. And I miss him. And I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever find him again. I cannot stop him from loving someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel unsure about everything and so sad I could fill buckets of tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve realised that now my relationship with words is truly conflicted. My marriage started off full of words and stories that I trusted and cherished, now words seem to be yet another tool for deceit and confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your attention to wording and your thoughtfulness in choosing words.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77479,"nextTopicId":77508}}
