There is ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1432589782\">from dr. sears&#39; website (who is apparently<br/>\npro-attachment parenting):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHITTING IS ACTUALLY NOT BIBLICAL <br/>\nDon&#39;t use the Bible as an excuse to spank. There is<br/>\nconfusion in the ranks of people of Judeo-Christian<br/>\nheritage who, seeking help from the Bible in their<br/>\neffort to raise godly children, believe that God<br/>\ncommands them to spank. They take &quot;spare the rod and<br/>\nspoil the child&quot; seriously and fear that if they don&#39;t<br/>\nspank, they will commit the sin of losing control of<br/>\ntheir child. In our counseling experience, we find<br/>\nthat these people are devoted parents who love God and<br/>\nlove their children, but they misunderstand the<br/>\nconcept of the rod. <br/>\nRod verses - what they really mean. The following are<br/>\nthe biblical verses which have caused the greatest<br/>\nconfusion: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the<br/>\nrod of discipline will drive it far from him.&quot; (Prov.<br/>\n22:15) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves<br/>\nhim is careful to discipline him.&quot; (Prov. 13:24) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you<br/>\npunish him with the rod, he will not die. Punish him<br/>\nwith the rod and save his soul from death.&quot; (Prov.<br/>\n23:13-14) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child<br/>\nleft to itself disgraces his mother.&quot; (Prov. 29:15) <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first glance these verses may sound pro-spanking.<br/>\nBut you might consider a different interpretation of<br/>\nthese teachings. &quot;Rod&quot; (shebet) means different things<br/>\nin different parts of the Bible. The Hebrew dictionary<br/>\ngives this word various meanings: a stick (for<br/>\npunishment, writing, fighting, ruling, walking, etc.).<br/>\nWhile the rod could be used for hitting, it was more<br/>\nfrequently used for guiding wandering sheep. Shepherds<br/>\ndidn&#39;t use the rod to beat their sheep - and children<br/>\nare certainly more valuable than sheep. As<br/>\nshepherd-author Philip Keller teaches so well in A<br/>\nShepherd Looks At Psalm 23, the shepherd&#39;s rod was<br/>\nused to fight off prey and the staff was used to<br/>\ngently guide sheep along the right path. (&quot;Your rod<br/>\nand your staff, they comfort me.&quot;  Psalm 23:4). <br/>\n<br/>\nJewish families we&#39;ve interviewed, who carefully<br/>\nfollow dietary and lifestyle guidelines in the<br/>\nScripture, do not practice &quot;rod correction&quot; with their<br/>\nchildren because they do not follow that<br/>\ninterpretation of the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book of Proverbs is one of poetry. It is logical<br/>\nthat the writer would have used a well-known tool to<br/>\nform an image of authority. We believe that this is<br/>\nthe point that God makes about the rod in the Bible <br/>\nparents take charge of your children. When you re-read<br/>\nthe &quot;rod verses,&quot; use the concept of parental<br/>\nauthority when you come to the word &quot;rod,&quot; rather than<br/>\nthe concept of beating or spanking. It rings true in<br/>\nevery instance. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Christians and Jews believe that the Old<br/>\nTestament is the inspired word of God, it is also a<br/>\nhistorical text that has been interpreted in many ways<br/>\nover the centuries, sometimes incorrectly in order to<br/>\nsupport the beliefs of the times. These &quot;rod&quot; verses<br/>\nhave been burdened with interpretations about corporal<br/>\npunishment that support human ideas. Other parts of<br/>\nthe Bible, especially the New Testament, suggest that<br/>\nrespect, authority, and tenderness should be the<br/>\nprevailing attitudes toward children among people of<br/>\nfaith. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the New Testament, Christ modified the traditional<br/>\neye-for-an-eye system of justice with His<br/>\nturn-the-other-cheek approach. Christ preached<br/>\ngentleness, love, and understanding, and seemed<br/>\nagainst any harsh use of the rod, as stated by Paul in<br/>\n1 Cor. 4:21: &quot;Shall I come to you with the whip (rod),<br/>\nor in love and with a gentle spirit?&quot; Paul went on to<br/>\nteach fathers about the importance of not provoking<br/>\nanger in their children (which is what spanking<br/>\nusually does): &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate your<br/>\nchildren&quot; (Eph. 6:4), and &quot;Fathers, do not embitter<br/>\nyour children, or they will be discouraged&quot; (Col.<br/>\n3:21). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our opinion, nowhere in the Bible does it say you<br/>\nmust spank your child to be a godly parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T062100.asp\">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T062100.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNever miss a thing.
