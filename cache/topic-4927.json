My daughter, Donika (soon to be 19 <br/>\n-has only gone to college) just started taking a &quot;full&quot; load at Grossmont <br/>\nCommunity college.  She has taken some classes there since she was 15 - <br/>\nmostly dance- as a high school student.  Anyway, we went to a Romanian dance <br/>\nworkshop where we often dance.  At the potluck dinner some friends were <br/>\nasking her about school.  She was telling them what she was taking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne man didn&#39;t know she had never gone to &quot;regular&quot; school.  I said that she <br/>\nhad shared with me that during one of the first lectures in astronomy, the <br/>\nteacher said he was going to tell an interesting story, and then did.  She <br/>\nsaid &quot;I was nodding and agreeing with him, and then I looked around and so <br/>\nmany of the kids looked bored, and one even said, what&#39;s interesting about <br/>\nthat?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that when her oldest brother started college classes, he came home <br/>\nand said &quot;I feel so FRESH.  The other kids have been doing this for so many <br/>\nyears, they don&#39;t think it is fun or interesting.&quot;  She agreed that that <br/>\nexpressed exactly how she felt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man last night went on to say that it is because of the &quot;lower&quot; level of <br/>\nstudent at community colleges -- ditto the professors, etc, etc.  Of course <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t know I know he has his only daughter in a boarding school <br/>\n(expensive!) on the east coast.  (We live in CA.)  His daughter is only 13 - <br/>\nand when I last saw her she told me she HATED her school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just dropped the whole subject.  I love my &quot;fresh&quot; children - and having <br/>\nthem in my life regularly too!!  We each make our own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie Colten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4903,"nextTopicId":4901}}
