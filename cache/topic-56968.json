I didn&#39;t even think that until a close friend gently suggested it.  Back then, I sorta went through some denial and avoidance, and then became a bit fixated on it.  I wasn&#39;t willy-nilly in talking about it with others, but I did explore what the suggestions were for kids with Asperger&#39;s, and I implemented some of them.  We saw a naturopath, but we didn&#39;t seek a diagnosis or label.  We made some dietary changes and I changed the way I interacted with him.  I changed our expectations of how he&#39;d navigate social situations, and I was more careful in where we&#39;d go, when, and with whom.  All those things helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just the other day my oldest was telling his best friend about that, and he casually asked my husband, &quot;What was it you thought Jonathan had?&quot;  Which led to Jonathan saying, &quot;What do you mean I HAD something?&quot; I wasn&#39;t there to help navigate that conversation.  It was news to Jonathan that we&#39;d ever considered something to be wrong with him.  There&#39;ve been several questions since - What kinds of things did I do?  How long was I like that?  What was it called again?  What do you mean I couldn&#39;t go to some places?  What would I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been very upsetting, and I regret that I let it consume us for a while.  Alas, I cannot go back in time.  Many of the things I learned about dealing with people who are very sensitive still serve me to this day.  I never expect that a kid will (or will want to) talk to me, for example.  I am very respectful of their space.  BUT, even though it&#39;s been a long time (12 yrs) since that original period of worry and focus, it&#39;s affecting my son&#39;s self-esteem and view of himself NOW.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n&quot;Keep company with those who make you better.&quot; ~ English saying<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] getting OT... sensititve vs critical periods","postDate":"1282806372","msgId":57021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9RjMxUEx3ODFRUExHNUZxSnFFel91R3NNX3o2Y2JYczc0cTExVEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzNzczLjY3NDM1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGk1NDJiNSttMWdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8ODM3NzMuNjc0MzUucW1Ad2ViODE1MDcubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57019,"nextInTopic":57027,"prevInTime":57020,"nextInTime":57022,"topicId":56968,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Brian (my Brian at any rate) can imitate sounds and speak foreign words from just about any language with no accent, including Chinese, without learning the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1225190197\">Brian (my Brian at any rate) can imitate sounds and speak foreign<br/>\nwords from just about any language with no accent, including Chinese,<br/>\nwithout learning the language fluently.

I have been mostly quite laid back in terms of his Tourettes, and we don&#39;t talk about it with him, because he does not talk about it with us.  It just *is*.  The mainstream approach is of course to draw attention to these things, go to a bazillion therapies and such.  We have not done that.  It never felt right.  It is a question I had to ask though, because that tiny voice in my head tells me I cannot just do *nothing* about it.  I don&#39;t want to be negligent.  It&#39;s scary to break out of the mold.  Hopefully anyone else who reads this and has this question in their head as well, can feel at more peace as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;naturewalkersinfo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---- I guess my bottom line question is what do you do when there is something in the way of your child learning something (that they themselves want to know)?----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This might sound harsh, and I don&#39;t mean it to be, but regardless of your son&#39;s diagnoses, your approach to unschooling should be the same: follow his lead.
