I said no, again.  Not “again” the same person, but another request to translate it, and the answer is always the same—every page leads to a page on my site.  I don’t think the book without the links would be the same.  (Maybe I’m wrong.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause that was fresh in my mind, though, I was thinking my thoughts and it came by for me to ask people how many thing they *HATED.*  And how many things could a person HATE without that person being, literally, HATEful—full of hate.  This leans toward the discussion on prejudices in this forum not too long ago.  Accepting prejudices in ourselves without looking at them can keep us ourselves from seeing and thinking as clearly as we could otherwise.  But HATING things… that leads to, and preserves, hatred.<br/>\n<br/>\nSukayna continued:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I live in a place where there are over 2 million refugees, war is next door and we&#39;ve been through our own recently, there are very real poverty, corruption, and infrastructure problems, power outages water cuts etc etc. I survive (thrive even!) by being mindful and grateful and embracing the good and beautiful in my everyday.

So… my bathroom sink is draining very slowly.  That’s the worst problem I have right now.   Yet it would be possible for me to load up with “sky-is-falling woe and to moan in public about the end of civilization as we know it, and many online friends and in-person friends and relatives would approve my wailing.

Dozens of rational (I would hope) adults jumped my shit and said I was wrong (small-minded, callous, they meant, but couldn’t think of any better words than stupid or idiot or racist or whatever they had recently heard, I gues).<br/>\n<br/>\nNegativity is contagious.  <br/>\nFear is contagious.  <br/>\nPeople are gullible.
