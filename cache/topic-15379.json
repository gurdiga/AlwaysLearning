We get up near the headwaters<br/>\n  about once a year and camp, but we loaned our tent to David&#39;s sister and<br/>\n  it&#39;s in Germany now so we rented the cabin for three days and two nights.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dylan and I went up early Friday morning and got everything unpacked and<br/>\n  went for a hike.   We only intended to be gone for two hours or so but I<br/>\n  left my watch behind and we wandered back considerably later than I<br/>\n  intended.   David was there, having come up later after getting off work.<br/>\n  We had late night round the campfire, watching the stars.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Saturday morning David went fishing and later reported he&#39;d caught every<br/>\n  brookie and cut throat in the river.  He lost one fly but gained a frog,<br/>\n  who attached himself to David&#39;s wader and didn&#39;t want to leave. <br/>\n  We had been watching a moose in the river that morning so David was<br/>\n  expecting to have some company while he fished.  He did see two moose and<br/>\n  maneuvered around them, but the frog was harder to avoid.<br/>\n  This is the river he was fishing two years ago when a bear chased him<br/>\n  into the water.  The bear gets bigger every time he tells the story, so<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure the frog will too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  While David was fishing Dylan and I went hiking up the four wheeler trail<br/>\n  behind the cabin.   We saw elk and moose and evidence of bears but no<br/>\n  bears in person.  We kept hiking when we lost the trail and went to the<br/>\n  top of the mountain where we could look across to the west and see our<br/>\n  own mountain range, the Flint Creek range and beyond that the Sapphire<br/>\n  Mountains and the Garnet range to the north.   We found a great lodge<br/>\n  pole, misshapen by mistletoe, and ate our lunch under it in a sea of <br/>\n  blue lupine.   This great old tree was perfect for climbing, really<br/>\n  perfect, but I&#39;m not as good a tree climber as I used to be.  Come to<br/>\n  think of it I was never great.  I fell out of our big cottonwood when I<br/>\n  was five and broke my collar bone.  My mother had told me I&#39;d break my<br/>\n  neck someday and when I fell I was so mad that she had been right  I hid<br/>\n  from her for half a day before she found me whimpering under the bed with<br/>\n  my growing bruise and lumpy shoulder.   This lodge pole was a little like<br/>\n  that cotton wood and maybe I still had my mothers voice in my head<br/>\n  because I fell out of the tree.   I didn&#39;t break anything this time but I<br/>\n  must have bruised a rib because I&#39;m an interesting shade of yellowish<br/>\n  green today on my right side and it hurts if I breathe deeply.  <br/>\n  Dylan, it turns out, is a fearless tree and rock climber in spite of<br/>\n  seeing his old mother fall.   Because I&#39;d forgotten my compass and we&#39;d<br/>\n  gotten a little creative with our trail blazing we were temporarily<br/>\n  misplaced for a while and had to back track about a half mile before we<br/>\n  found our trail again.  The three hour hike back down to the cabin was<br/>\n  less fun than the hike up had been, but I ate some hot peppers and felt<br/>\n  better and moaned enough that David cooked for us while I lounged by the<br/>\n  campfire. &lt;g&gt;  Turns out I can spit a cherry pit cleanly twelve feet to<br/>\n  the back of the head of a smart ass husband.  I&#39;m continually amazed by<br/>\n  my own talents. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We waited for the coyotes that night and when we couldn&#39;t wait any longer<br/>\n  we howled to get them started.  It worked too, and we had a howling<br/>\n  chorus for about twenty minutes.  We&#39;re easily amused, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dylan broke up a fight between two macho pine sawyer beetles.  It&#39;s<br/>\n  amazing how much power those little buggers have and how tough they are. <br/>\n  He&#39;d carry one away to a different log and it&#39;d fly back to engage in<br/>\n  combat with the other again.  Now we&#39;ll have to see if we can find out<br/>\n  why they fight, if it&#39;s territory or women or just the pine sawyer tough<br/>\n  man competition.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sunday David left early to get ready for work and Dylan and I stayed to<br/>\n  play a little and investigate a different trail.  We&#39;re going up there<br/>\n  this week, or on the weekend to hike the Blackfoot meadows trail so maybe<br/>\n  we&#39;ll get back for the other, too.   I&#39;ve been up the Blackfoot meadows<br/>\n  trail but Dylan hasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s an eight hour hike if you don&#39;t dawdle<br/>\n  climbing trees.   I&#39;m not sure about the trail we found and started up<br/>\n  Sunday because I can&#39;t find it on the map but that&#39;s all the more reason<br/>\n  to see what&#39;s at the other end. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
