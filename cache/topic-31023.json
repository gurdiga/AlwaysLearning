Sometimes they change later when  <br/>\nI&#39;m not looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents figure the kids will learn somewhere, someday, things  <br/>\nlike table manners and how to use a phone book.

I tend to assume these &quot;imposters&quot; were unschoolers, but it<br/>\ndid make me wonder if there are people who &quot;use homeschooling laws&quot;<br/>\njust to be negligent, or if that&#39;s even possible to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wondered if it was common for traditional homeschoolers to<br/>\nview unschoolers as being negligent, or imposters, or &quot;not really<br/>\nhomeschoolers,&quot; or something similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn SC, we have to be a member of an Accountability Association in order <br/>\nto homeschool. NOT that&#39;s it&#39;s very accountable!!! I run one now---and <br/>\nknow first-hand that there&#39;s NO accountability going on. Which is *JUST <br/>\nFINE* by me---I can&#39;t figure out *why* accountability is necessary in <br/>\nthe first place. The *schools* aren&#39;t even remotely accountable, and <br/>\nyet we expect the parents to be? To whom??? It&#39;s crazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nANYWAY...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of people who join an association and say they <br/>\nhomeschool just so they don&#39;t have to fight with their <br/>\nchildren---usually teens---about going to school. It&#39;s not about doing <br/>\nthe work or getting the grades---it&#39;s simply about *showing up*! They <br/>\ncan no longer *make* their kids go to school; so rather than fight with <br/>\nthem (and it&#39;s not the fight that is the issue: it&#39;s being *truant* <br/>\nthat&#39;s the problem. The parent is responsible!), they just say they <br/>\nhomeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are *certainly* not UNschooling---not by *my* definition, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nParaphrasing Holt (because I tried to find the quote, but kept getting <br/>\nside-tracked and spent 50 ennjoyable minutes googling Holt quotes! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;): Better to sit back and do nothing than allow the harm actively <br/>\ndone in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a parent wants to pull a child out of school and &quot;let him <br/>\nbe&quot;---to me, that&#39;s preferable than forcing him in school. It&#39;s NOT <br/>\nunschooling---even by a long shot, but it&#39;ll be less damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.
