Open can, pour into pot, add can of water, turn on burner, stir <br/>\ntill warm enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had it figured out. So the next time I tried to make Chef Boy R Dee ravioli using <br/>\nthe same procedure. Including the can of water. Only you dont add a can of water to <br/>\nEVERYTHING you make on the stove, so it was all, you know, soupy, and not good. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in highschool, I lived with my mom, who was by then divorced. She paid me 10$  <br/>\na week to have dinner on the table when she got home from work. The only rule was that I <br/>\ncouldnt make breakfast for dinner more than once a week. Oh, and then another rule came <br/>\nthat everything couldnt be the same color. That was because one night I made chicken, corn, <br/>\nand cornbread. I thought it was a nice theme. My mom thought it was nutritionally deficient <br/>\nto have monochromatic meals. I learned how to make a lot of basic dinners, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284219281,"authorName":"Meghan Anderson-Coates","from":"Meghan Anderson-Coates &lt;meghanandco@...&gt;","profile":"meghanandco","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: learning to cook","postDate":"1212542495","msgId":35210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3OTIyMS41MDI4NS5xbUB3ZWI1ODYxNS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35194,"nextInTopic":35214,"prevInTime":35209,"nextInTime":35211,"topicId":35167,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****** Her newest - Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less.

I read a while at her site, and I thought  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s below might be perfect for some of the moms here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are two things from a longer list of questions and answers here:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow and when did you start cooking?<br/>\nI started make-believe cooking when I was a toddler, using invisible  <br/>\ningredients, plus grass, flowers, and mud. I started cooking with  <br/>\nreal food when I was about 8 or 9. My mother and grandmother let me  <br/>\nfollow them around the kitchen, and I was entranced. I tested and  <br/>\nwrote my first recipe when I was 9. It was for a chocolate dessert  <br/>\nthat leaked out of the oven door and across the floor. My wonderful,  <br/>\npatient mother, instead of yelling at me, said, &quot;Well this is  <br/>\ncertainly original. Let&#39;s give it a name.&quot; We called it &quot;Creeping  <br/>\nAustralian BooBoo.&quot; Lacking the good sense to be deterred, I went on  <br/>\nto write many more recipes over the next 35+ years. Somewhere along  <br/>\nthe way, I figured out how to have things stay in the oven.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat advice would you give a young person who is interested in a food  <br/>\ncareer?<br/>\nRead as many cookbooks and food publications as possible. Immerse  <br/>\nyourself in the material! Peruse food markets, and save your money to  <br/>\nhave occasional restaurant meals in good places. Ask questions of  <br/>\nexperienced cooks. Get a job prepping in a restaurant that makes the  <br/>\nkind of food you like. And above all, experiment with your own ideas  <br/>\nin the kitchen. You might not need to go to culinary school if you do  <br/>\nall the above. On the other hand, culinary school, if you can afford  <br/>\nit, might be the way to go. Visit one, and see what it&#39;s like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.molliekatzen.com/faq.php\">http://www.molliekatzen.com/faq.php</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35173,"nextTopicId":35182}}
