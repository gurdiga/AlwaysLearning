I&#39;m convinced because of experience learning something happens when it is needed and wanted.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the second part, but sometimes it does help to have someone assist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to learn to play recorder on my own, but needed someone to show me just a couple of things about how to old it and what &quot;half hole&quot; really looked like, in practice.  (It&#39;s much less than half, and there are good ways to do it so that the transitions between notes is fast and smooth.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to learn to do calligraphy with a dip pen, but failed in three attempts over ten years or so, because I needed to watch someone do it, and to have them spot me on the angle to hold a flat-nib pen.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays there are online videos for that sort of thing, but there weren&#39;t back then.  And a video can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing wrong and point it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t learn ballet or karate from a video very well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think it&#39;s true that someone can&#39;t be taught something if he&#39;s not interested, I think that when someone is ready and eager, it can help to have a coach, at least at first, for some things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could show you how to make a basket with rope and yarn.  I could show you how to do a faced facing.  I sure wouldn&#39;t want to take money for that and feel a responsibility to ensure that you were able to do it to specifications later, but for fun, if you were interested, I could show you.  If you learned it, I would have taught you.  If you didn&#39;t learn it, I would&#39;ve been just talking while I did something I already knew how to do, and you would&#39;ve been ignoring me, or thinking about something else, or being baffled if I wasn&#39;t explaining it well.  But IF you went away from there understanding it, it would be because you learned it.  That part&#39;s very true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe examples above couldn&#39;t be &quot;taught&quot; to someone who didn&#39;t have the physical dexterity (in the first case) or a fair amount of sewing experience (for the faced facing).  And reading can&#39;t be &quot;taught&quot; to someone who doesn&#39;t have a lot of knowledge and ability already in place.  Sometimes that all comes together the same season there are reading lessons, and then it seems the teacher taught it.  It helps, with unschooling, to wait to answer questions the learners have.  The coach is living right in the same house, and the information can be requested any time of the week, day or night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Huge , exciting news around here!","postDate":"1332069101","msgId":66234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU0MEQzMzU1LTM3NDEtNEE2QS05QzI5LTJEMjVBRDVEMjM1Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENEQjJBRjIyLTU2MUYtNEQxMi05MUJBLURGMjNFRTVFMTA5MEBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGprMzJobytjcjcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0RCMkFGMjItNTYxRi00RDEyLTkxQkEtREYyM0VFNUUxMDkwQGJpZ3BvbmQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66233,"nextInTopic":66237,"prevInTime":66233,"nextInTime":66235,"topicId":66226,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think it s good not to be vested in outcomes like learning to read .
