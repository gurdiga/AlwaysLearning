He says the likes the Playstation controller better than the<br/>\nGame Cube and there are more games available on the Playstation. And the are<br/>\na lot of fun games for the Playstation.  One of his favorite games for<br/>\nPlaystation is SSX Tricky a snow boarding game.<br/>\nMy 11 year old also says Playstation2 because there are a lot of fun games<br/>\nfor the Playstation.  His favorite game at the moment is Tekkon Tag<br/>\ntournament which is a fighting game so not sure how you feel about those.<br/>\nMy 10 year old said the most important things to look for are good graphics,<br/>\nhow smooth the game plays, the number of good games available and the size<br/>\nof the controllers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says to definitely not get the X-box (perhaps cos he doesn&#39;t have one) as<br/>\nthere controller is too big and there aren&#39;t so many good games available.<br/>\nMy 11 year old says the console is too big.<br/>\nThe Playstation 2 can also be used as a DVD player which is handy sometimes.<br/>\nIf you want the opinion of an adult my husband also plays these games for<br/>\nhours and I can ask him when he comes home.<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nJill in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7459,"nextTopicId":7481}}
