Certainly never <br/>\nlike a puppy-dog.  But at 16 we have been dealing with hormonal <br/>\nchanges, to be sure.  And we see this in so many teens around us.  <br/>\nHer friends who for the most part go to school are changing, too, and <br/>\ntheir rebellion, in some anyway, tends to be more acute: lying to <br/>\ntheir parents, smoking, drinking, doing drugs, having sex.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHer body keeps changing, shifting and changing.  These changes might <br/>\nnot be so noticeable in every teen, maybe just a change in jean&#39;s <br/>\nsize.  But in one who sails around the ice rink on a 1/4&quot; blade of <br/>\nsteel, at high speed, with one leg up above her head, or who hurls <br/>\nherself through space torquing multiple times before landing on that <br/>\n1/4&quot; of steel, or who spins in a blur then stops on a dime, these <br/>\nsubtle changes can be devastating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer hips are spreading, a perfectly normal happening in girls as they <br/>\nmature.  But this changes the fine balance necessary for a figure <br/>\nskater to do the things she has been training to do for 9 years.  Now <br/>\nsimple things have become more difficult.  The jump she was doing so <br/>\neasily 6 months ago is now lost, has to be relearned.  When throwing <br/>\nher body through space every subtle little change in body fat, bone <br/>\nshifting, muscle mass, etc., is noticeable, throws off her balance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd her moods can be very unpredictable.  Not terrible.  Not <br/>\nsomething we can&#39;t live with or adjust to, but not the same as they <br/>\nused to be.  The girl who had utmost confidence, who sailed around <br/>\nthe ice like the honored princess, is now insecure, unsure of <br/>\nherself, afraid she will fail.  Her hair is awful.  Her face is a <br/>\nmess.  She has no clothes to wear.  What happened?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI see part of this as preparation for having the impetus to leave <br/>\nhome.  Otherwise it is awfully tempting for her to just see herself <br/>\nas staying home with Mom and Dad forever.  So the struggle plays out <br/>\nin our lives as she wrestles with it inside herself.  She spent last <br/>\nsummer mostly away from home, attending college, living on campus, <br/>\ngoing to several one week and two-week symposia and conferences far <br/>\naway.  So she is split.  One part wants to stay and one part wants to <br/>\nbreak away.  And we try to cope and try to smooth the way as much as <br/>\npossible for whatever decision she makes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we are affected by the struggle.  Sometimes it hurts so much.  <br/>\nHurts her.  Hurts us.  But just as quickly she turns around and, <br/>\nindeed, cuddles in our laps, wants to be held and petted.  Is it <br/>\neasier this way, easier to have parents who can go with the flow?  <br/>\nWho can ride the hormone-driven emotional roller coaster with her?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know.  But it&#39;s much too late to turn back now.  Will let you <br/>\nknow in a few years.  Meanwhile I guess it&#39;s time to learn to like <br/>\nroller coaster rides.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, every teen may not face the same challenges, the same <br/>\nphysical changes.  But some will, and for some, no matter how much <br/>\nthey love us, or we them, this is still a difficult time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154862465,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] For Your Critique","postDate":"1069945687","msgId":17430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGQzYxMzU3LjkwNDA5MDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCRUI1M0RCLjIxNEI3JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJCRUI1M0RCLjIxNEI3JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":17429,"nextInTopic":17431,"prevInTime":17429,"nextInTime":17431,"topicId":17424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was<br/>\nrecently circulated on a local homeschooling list I am<br/>\non (not in CA) and I didn&#39;t really didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nstart a firestorm by commenting on it there.  I am<br/>\ncurious what the take is by this thoroughly<br/>\nunschooling crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my part, I have definate opinions about it, and<br/>\nthey are not very favorable.  Maybe I am taking this<br/>\nthe wrong way, or maybe I just need to lighten up. <br/>\nWhat are some thoughts from all of you?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n* /The Cat Years/ from the San Francisco Chronicle by<br/>\nAdair Lara:  *<br/>\n<br/>\n*I** just realized that while children are dogs --<br/>\nloyal and <br/>\naffectionate-- teenagers are cats. It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>\na dog owner.  You <br/>\nfeed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>\nyour knee and <br/>\ngazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>\nbounds indoors <br/>\nwith enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>\ninto a big old <br/>\ncat. When you tell it to come inside, it looks amazed,<br/>\nas if wondering <br/>\nwho died and made you emperor.  Instead of dogging<br/>\nyour footsteps, it <br/>\ndisappears. You won&#39;t see it again until it gets<br/>\nhungry-then it pauses <br/>\non its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn<br/>\nits nose up at <br/>\nwhatever you&#39;re serving. When you reach out to ruffle<br/>\nits head, in that <br/>\nold affectionate gesture, it twists away from you,<br/>\nthen gives you a <br/>\nblank stare, as if trying to remember where It has<br/>\nseen you before.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*You, not realizing that the dog is now a cat, think<br/>\nsomething must be <br/>\ndesperately wrong with it.  It seems so antisocial, so<br/>\ndistant, sort of <br/>\ndepressed.  It won&#39;t go on family outings.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*Since you&#39;re the one who raised it, taught it to<br/>\nfetch and stay and sit <br/>\non command, you assume that you did something wrong.<br/>\nFlooded with guilt <br/>\nand fear, you redouble your efforts to make your pet<br/>\nbehave. Only now <br/>\nyou&#39;re dealing with a cat, so everything that worked<br/>\nbefore now produces <br/>\nthe opposite of the desired result. Call it, and it<br/>\nruns away. Tell it <br/>\nto sit, and it jumps on the counter.  The more you go<br/>\ntoward it, <br/>\nwringing your hands, the more it moves away. *<br/>\n<br/>\n*Instead of continuing to act like a dog owner, you<br/>\ncan learn to behave <br/>\nlike a cat owner.  Put a dish of food near the door,<br/>\nand let it come to <br/>\nyou.  But remember that a cat needs your help and<br/>\naffection too.  Sit <br/>\nstill, and it will come, seeking that warm, comforting<br/>\nlap it has not <br/>\nentirely forgotten.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*One day, your grown-up child will walk into the<br/>\nkitchen, give you a big <br/>\nkiss and say, &quot;You&#39;ve been on your feet all day. Let<br/>\nme get those dishes <br/>\nfor you.&quot; Then you&#39;ll realize your cat is a dog again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17439,"nextTopicId":17440}}
