Hornworms love the dill and gravitate to it, and it&#39;s much easier to spot the hornworms on the dill plants than on the tomato plants. Plus the dill is yummy to cook with! I&#39;ve read that fennel works like dill for attracting hornworms, but haven&#39;t tried that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you plant squash, you&#39;ll get squash bugs. They&#39;re interesting to watch (although they destroy squash plants like nobody&#39;s business, so we don&#39;t much enjoy having them show up in our garden!). You have to flip over the leaf of the squash plant to find the bugs -- they lay their eggs on the underside of the leaf and the babies tend to hang out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] loves bugs ... any ideas?","postDate":"1294858729","msgId":58906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1QjBBM0NCLTEzODgtNERBQy05MTE5LUUyMjJCOTZDQzNFMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlnanIycys5bjBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlnanIycys5bjBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58905,"nextInTopic":58908,"prevInTime":58905,"nextInTime":58907,"topicId":58894,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- We are going to order tomato hornworms in the spring and raise them. -=- You can get free worms just by planting tomatoes, and they ll need the tomato","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-896489034\">-=-<br/>\nWe are going to order tomato hornworms in the spring and raise them. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get free worms just by planting tomatoes, and they&#39;ll need the tomato plants, too, for food.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne  year I planted tomatoes just to get the worm. Holly hadn&#39;t seen one.  One showed up, and it was so perfect!  I left it there.  The next day one of our six plants was totally stripped.   So I think if you have a tomato worm plan, buy some tomatoes and get them established and don&#39;t expect ever to harvest any tomatoes. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he has any interest in worms, you can buy redworms and give them garbage, and they will be happy and reproduce.  They have a pellet, not quiet an egg, from which a new worm will come.  Once I learned to recognize those, I saw them lots, even in the wild.  I&#39;ve had two batches of bought worms, and the second one I put straight into the compost pile.  They survived into the next year.  I dug up some dirt just recently and there were live worms.  It&#39;s hard winter lately and I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re alive down there or not (in the dirt under where the compost pile was), because the ground is too hard to dig.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing about worms, though, is they can &quot;be released into the wild&quot; without risk of danger or injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you happen to be passing through Albuquerque in any warm season, come over to my house and I&#39;ll find him a black widow or two--not to hold, but to see.
