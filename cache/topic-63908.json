Thanks for the headset tip, I hadn&#39;t thought of that. I also like how you compromise by asking him to switch to video&#39;s I can see that working for us. I was chatting to Charlie today about falling asleep on the sofa, what he likes about it and it turns out that he wanted to watch videos on the Macbook which was downstairs and he fell asleep watching. If he has his smartphone he says he feels happy to watch the videos in bed. I have no issue with him sleeping on the sofa but we worry about the Macbook falling onto the floor.

Oh, a headset only covering one<br/>\near made a big difference, if it covered both ears he couldn&#39;t hear how<br/>\nloud he was getting.   If I wake up from the noise more than once I&#39;ll ask<br/>\nhim to switch to videos for the night once he&#39;s done with that part.  This<br/>\nrarely happens anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI set food up in advance and keep quick easy to make stuff on hand for him<br/>\nat all times.  This sometimes means making extra large batches of homemade<br/>\nchicken nuggets and extra large batches of pancakes to keep in the fridge,<br/>\nand sometimes means (when money permits) buying convenience freezer foods<br/>\nthat he can reheat.  When I make dinner I&#39;ll often make an extra plate all<br/>\nset up to throw in the microwave.  We keep lots of snacks around<br/>\nfrom pretzels to beef jerky to baby carrots and he eats a variety.  I&#39;ll<br/>\noften make him a monkey platter before I go to bed so he has something to<br/>\nmunch on while playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep the gaming systems in the living room.  We live in a duplex and his<br/>\nbedroom is against the neighbors bedroom, the living room is a full room<br/>\naway, this cuts down on noise transference.  We also know the neighbors so<br/>\nwe check in with them regularly to make sure noise isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made the living room comfortable for sleeping.  Right now there&#39;s a<br/>\ndaybed in there, but we&#39;re getting a new sofa and one of the tests for the<br/>\nsofa we ordered was how comfortable it was to lay down on.  Draven knows we<br/>\ndo our best to stay quiet when he&#39;s sleeping during the day out there, but<br/>\nsometimes I will wake him up accidentally and he&#39;s understanding about it,<br/>\njust like we&#39;re understanding when he wakes us up at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re making his room more inviting.  He&#39;s switched to sleeping in the<br/>\nliving room nightly (daily) now so for Christmas he&#39;s getting a new bedroom<br/>\nset and we&#39;re giving him the daybed that was previously in the living room.<br/>\n We&#39;re also getting him a box so he can watch Netflix in his room.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nmind him sleeping in the living room, I just don&#39;t like it being an every<br/>\nsingle night (day) thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe find other times to connect.  Sometimes I stay up late with him,<br/>\nsometimes my partner gets up earlier for work if he&#39;s still up, normally we<br/>\nhave the afternoon together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis sleeping schedule is very fluid, it changes from day to day and week to<br/>\nweek.  We warn him days in advance if anything needs to be done on a time<br/>\nschedule and keep reminding him so he can adjust accordingly.  When he was<br/>\nyounger this meant helping him settle down for sleep earlier and earlier<br/>\neach day, now he likes to handle it himself and does a great job.  Last<br/>\nweek I was shocked because he was going to bed and getting up before me,<br/>\nthen over the Thanksgiving break he switched back to being up most of the<br/>\nnight (probably because his friends were out of school and on Xbox later).<br/>\n Last night he went to bed before me and this morning he woke up after me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope something from this list helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":498320421,"authorName":"Victoria Otero","from":"Victoria Otero &lt;tori.otero@...&gt;","profile":"victoriaotero@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: sleep/bedtimes","postDate":"1322425414","msgId":63922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2RDI5MzQ4LTcyRUYtNDNEMC1BRDEyLUZFNTREOEY1QkEwNEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDRDdFQzhFLUE2MkYtNDMyMS05N0YyLTkzRkRCNUEyNUIwQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGphdGxkcytlNWhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTdBNzY4OEItODBGMS00M0VGLThDQTQtNUJBNEFEQkY3QTg1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUNEN0VDOEUtQTYyRi00MzIxLTk3RjItOTNGREI1QTI1QjBCQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63921,"nextInTopic":63923,"prevInTime":63921,"nextInTime":63923,"topicId":63908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... -=-It feels right to lift the restrictions without making an issue of it, make sure he s clear about staying quiet and address food and health as separate","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1532878429\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;This doesn&#39;t seem right to me:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-=-It feels right to lift the restrictions without making an issue of it, make sure he&#39;s clear about staying quiet and address food and health as separate issues. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCase by case, each night, let him stay up or not depending on what&#39;s going on the next day, and whether he was quiet enough the night before.

It has a purpose, and the purpose should have little to nothing to do with the clock or the table. Sometimes there are ceremonial meals--Thanksgiving, maybe birthday dinners, welcome-home and going-away things sometimes.

His dad has been OK with it and MD even goes help him in the<br/>\nmorning doing chores, which dad loves and they connect. Dad has been sweet about it.<br/>\nOn Monday and Tuesday he slept during the day then was awake all night. Then he did not go to bed during the day on Wednesday because his friend came to play with him all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe went to be at 8PM  Wednesday . Thursday he  was up by 10 AM to go to Thanksgiving lunch.<br/>\nHe then went to bed at really late on Thursday. I don&#39;t know  maybe at 2-3AM and early Friday his friend came again at 7AM to spend the day and he woke up. Then Friday he went to bed at 1230AM and slept until 530 PM yesterday!!!!!<br/>\n He was awake all last night. I got up late today with his sister and his dad is napping in MD&#39;s chair ( after doing morning chores) and he is in his mushroom chair sleeping!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did want to go to bed early last night but I told him that he had just slept over 16 hours and had only been awake for a few so that was going to be hard. I already gave tips on relaxing, reading a book, listening to an audio book ( that helps a lot sometimes)watching some TV in his bed, drinking some warm chamomile tea that he loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe maybe in some sort of transition. Maybe getting ready for a growth spur or hormones maybe kicking in or getting ready to. I do not know.<br/>\nFood had been a challenge because he only likes very fresh made food. I am going to get some containers and lunchables and snack size packaged food for him. I am also going to get him some easy microwavable food he can make himself. I make sure I give him something good right before I go to bed. I am right next door to his room too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember him staying awake all night when he was 5 to 6 and in love with playing Roblox. That changed. It changes all the time.<br/>\nThe funny thing is that I was like that too and still can stay awake  all night!  This fall I was uncomfortable with him waking up in the middle of the afternoon, maybe because his dad complained.  Maybe it was just me needing to get over it. ( funny that I did not have a problem when he was younger!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and yes being quiet is a must. He has a head phone and used for all his gaming. I have no neighbors but his dad get up at 430Am and needs his sleep. It does not bother me as I have usually very light sleep and wake up many times at night anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":377201113,"authorName":"mitrisue","from":"&quot;mitrisue&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"mitrisue","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: sleep/bedtimes","postDate":"1322417422","msgId":63931,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGphdHVlZStwYW1iQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3QTc2ODhCLTgwRjEtNDNFRi04Q0E0LTVCQTRBREJGN0E4NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63925,"nextInTopic":63939,"prevInTime":63930,"nextInTime":63932,"topicId":63908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I thought I&#39;d done lots of reading about unschooling but on reflection we let go of too much to soon. Charlie watched loads of TV in the early days and would watch &#39;Chowder&#39; episode after episode into and through out the night. Over time this changed and he started to go to bed when we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie is an avid gamer and over the past six months started to play with others online. He has developed some close friendships (they play and skype regularly, sometimes daily and often for many hours ) and he really values this play. We live in the UK and there is a five hour time difference to manage. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe started staying up all night again, and his sleep pattern shifted. I was/I am concerned about him missing meals, being cold and hungry whilst we are asleep. Concerned that we aren&#39;t available to support technically and/or emotionally as needed. I was also concerned that staying up all night and sleeping during the day meant we weren&#39;t as connected with each other and I would/have missed that. We discussed the issues with him, and worked out a compromise. For a short time this involved us agreeing a bedtime, and us putting our alarm clock on so we could wake up and help him to bed. We soon realised this was a short term solution and didn&#39;t want to continue to have to wake during the night. Another issue is that Charlie finds it hard to keep his voice low whilst skyping and playing, he is so excited and happy that he forgets that others are sleeping, but we need to sleep and so do the neighbours. We don&#39;t want to keep getting up to help remind him. There have been a few times we have turned off the internet because of the noise and told him to go to bed. I started thinking after further reading on Sandra&#39;s website that our expectations were too high, it was too much for him to manage. Trouble is he has started to sneak downstairs to use his dad&#39;s computer or the laptop. This doesn&#39;t feel right and we don&#39;t want him to have to sneak around/potentially lie/scheme to get his need to play with valued friends met.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Charlie came to me saying he wanted to play with his friend during the night.
