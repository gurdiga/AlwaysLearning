I have a television, cable channels,<br/>\ninternet access and I subscribe to email lists which discuss the topics I<br/>\nfind interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are passionate about many things; art, music, reading,<br/>\npretend, video games, etc.  I, out of a passion for them, try to provide<br/>\nthose things which satisfy them; art supplies, musical instruments, books<br/>\nand frequent library visits, dress up costumes and props, video games and<br/>\nconsoles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so natural really, I love to see them not just happy but zealous;<br/>\nexcited about whatever they&#39;re doing.  For me, it&#39;s a no brainer, I<br/>\nacquire those things that I can please them with and thus please myself;<br/>\na win-win situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
