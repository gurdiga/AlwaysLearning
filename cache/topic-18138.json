A few accomodations were<br/>\nmade for him (set up ahead of time) and he did know at least a handful of<br/>\nthe other campers, but it was a big deal for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer another boy we know went for the first time. We&#39;ve known him<br/>\nfor years, and he&#39;s always had difficulty picking up social cues and<br/>\nfitting into his peer group. He also had a fairly successful experience -<br/>\nhe said he enjoyed it, and he made some friends to hang out with. Grace<br/>\ntalked with him some and helped him with some issues he was having, as<br/>\ndid some of the other campers (&quot;Dude, you can&#39;t just go up and hug<br/>\npeople, sometimes they don&#39;t want a hug. Just go up and hold your arms<br/>\nout, and they&#39;ll hug you if they want to.&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been 2 or 3 &quot;camper parties&quot; here on the farm where we live.<br/>\nIt was interesting to me that all the kids were doing different things,<br/>\nthey each had their own paths. Some had found something they loved and<br/>\nwere working in that field, others were exploring lots of paths. Some<br/>\nlooked very &quot;straight&quot;, others had dyed or shaved heads and looked more<br/>\nalternative. Some cooked meals for everyone, others never washed a dish<br/>\n(although the group did create a dish chart). Some were friendly and<br/>\noutgoing, others didn&#39;t say 2 words to me. They all seemed to be nice<br/>\nkids - they included Rain when she was over there, walked her home at<br/>\nnight after Rocky Horror (100 yeards or so) - and she developed a nice<br/>\nlittle case of hero-worship towards one lovely Canadian girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Norma has a story to tell -she&#39;s told it here and lots of other<br/>\nplaces.

I also wished <br/>\nthat I could get some feedback from parents whose children would not <br/>\nbe returning, but I can&#39;t think of a way for that to happen outside <br/>\nof posting to message lists like this. Yours is not the first <br/>\ndetailed negative account that I&#39;ve read.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEllen:<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you appreciated my report and those of others elsewhere.  I do <br/>\nnot condemn Grace&#39;s camp, since obviously a large group of those <br/>\nattending do enjoy it and choose to return.  But you will nowhere <br/>\nfind statistics on the percentage who neither enjoy it, nor those who <br/>\njust stay quiet and choose not to return.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter did find that many things the handbook said were not only <br/>\nnot enforced but left to benign neglect.  Think teens and their usual <br/>\ninclinations, and you will get my drift.  Suffice it to say that I <br/>\nhope that these teens had good sex education and practiced safe sex.  <br/>\nAnd my daughter also found that many of these kids had poor relations <br/>\nwith their parents, were typical teen rebels, and were also social <br/>\nrebels, in one form or another.  Now I certainly don&#39;t hold that <br/>\nagainst anyone.  These rebels need somewhere to go and a group to <br/>\nwhich they can relate, I suppose.  As a matter of fact, my daughter <br/>\nobserved that many of these teens did not have any other friends with <br/>\nwhom they could relate.  NBTSC became their main venue for <br/>\nfriendships.  Then some campers were brand new to home education, and <br/>\nespecially to unschooling.  Some were still in their deschooling <br/>\nphase, still smarting from the hurts of institutionalized learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe NBTS &quot;hands-off&quot; approach is fine, as long as nothing goes <br/>\nwrong.  But if something does go wrong, or is threatening to go <br/>\nwrong, there is no safety net there.  And that policy is high risk <br/>\nfor some of the kids who ended up at this camp.  Again, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat is terribly unusual with this type of teen.  Just needs better <br/>\ncamp management. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe things that disappointed me more were the reactions of other <br/>\nparents who wanted nothing to do with anyone who had any legitimate <br/>\ncomplaints; and that included me and several others from the one <br/>\nsession we attended.  Those who may have chosen to sue certainly had <br/>\ntheir own reasons to do so, and the courts or the lawyers will settle <br/>\ntheir claims.  But I would have hoped that a situation like this <br/>\nwould have some kind of established conflict resolution process for <br/>\nthings like those that my daughter experienced.  Even a teen peer <br/>\nprocess would have helped.  But none existed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome teen boys can behave like wild dogs in packs in this kind of <br/>\nsituation, and try things they would never do at home.  And grabbing <br/>\na 98# girl and forcing her to do something she did not want or intend <br/>\nto do is illegal, and would not be tolerated by most families I <br/>\nknow.  Racial slurs happen everywhere, and some families are very <br/>\ntolerant of those, but one would hope that those who are attending <br/>\nthis type of camp would, again, have some recourse for this type of <br/>\nbehavior.  An apology from those involved would have sufficed, but <br/>\nnone was offered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cold weather was not Grace&#39;s fault, but stating clearly how cold <br/>\nit gets and how wet it can be, information readily available to Grace <br/>\nfrom the local agricultural and weather resources, plus the condition <br/>\nof the cabins, with bare boards with open cracks to the outdoors, <br/>\nmight prepare folks better for appropriate clothing and bedding to <br/>\nbring with them.  We drove our daughter to the camp in West Virginia <br/>\nand we were put off by some of the properties rather close to the <br/>\ncamp that looked more like dumps than homes.  And having lived in <br/>\npoor rural areas for the greater portion of my life, I am not talking <br/>\nabout just poor mountain folks.  I am talking about dumps, the kind <br/>\nthat propogate rats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe food situation, which even on the NBTSC parents&#39; list, was <br/>\nadmittedly sometimes awful, just does not go with the supposed <br/>\nphilosophy of freedom tolerated in all other areas.  Why force kids <br/>\nto eat a very unusual diet imposed by the camp director alone?  This <br/>\njust doesn&#39;t make sense.  And the kids were not involved in the <br/>\nchoices, the preparation, any part of the food process.  I have <br/>\ncooked for large groups at various conferences and camps and had no <br/>\ndifficulty coming up with good lacto-ovo vegetarian food that <br/>\neveryone enjoyed.  At many of our Quaker yearly meetings we <br/>\naccommodate everyone, vegetarians and carnivores, with ease.  And <br/>\nthen to not have enough food, or to have teens hoarding food with no <br/>\naccountability, well, it was just not a good situation.  Cold, wet, <br/>\nand poor food choices do not make for a good camp experience.  But <br/>\nthis is easily corrected and I hope that future camp sessions will <br/>\nstrive to take care of this situation.  Otherwise pack up a large box <br/>\nwith a week&#39;s worth of back-pack style meals for any campers <br/>\nattending NBTSC.  Might be a good idea no matter what the web site or <br/>\nthe brochure tells you.      <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;I&#39;m glad that there are many kids who find the experience enjoyable <br/>\nand rewarding, as they seem to be in the majority, but I wonder where <br/>\nthe compassion is for those kids whose experience is miserable (and <br/>\npossibly actionable) through no fault of their own.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect they are the majority, too, since so many of the campers <br/>\nare returnees.  And, yes, it was that compassion, especially for <br/>\nthose who were subjected to some very nasty and illegal behaviors, <br/>\nand who ended up bearing more responsibility for those attending than <br/>\nshe was ever prepared to handle, that I felt was clearly lacking.  <br/>\nNeither the teens themselves, nor their parents, nor the camp <br/>\ndirector offered any kind of true compassion for what happened.  That <br/>\nis not a situation to which I would ever choose to subject any <br/>\nchild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately I was far more careful with the camps and campuses she <br/>\nattended this past year, grilling the program directors on everything <br/>\nbeforehand, and am pleased to say that what she experienced at NBTSC <br/>\nis not common. All the other experiences were good.  One had poor <br/>\nquality food, but she had learned her lesson on that and taken her <br/>\nown stash to supplement the camp&#39;s offerings.  She did not experience <br/>\nany of the other problems she experienced at NBTSC. And no facility <br/>\nwas as questionable as the one in West Virginia, either.  The camp <br/>\nshe attended in North Carolina was gorgeous, in an extraordinary <br/>\nsetting, surrounded by natural beauty and lovely homes.  The cabins <br/>\nwere warm and had private baths for the 7 campers and one counselor <br/>\nin each cabin.  Still, several campers suffered severe reactions to <br/>\nbee stings there, and the emergencies were handled quickly, with <br/>\nproper medical care.  My daughter reactivated a knee injury from her <br/>\nfigure skating and the nurse phoned me to tell me what they were <br/>\ndoing to accommodate her knee pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campus situation she attended was even better, with lots of <br/>\nfreedom, minimal normal coed campus rules, a great group of teens, <br/>\nand excellent staff.  Even in extremely hot weather with no air-<br/>\nconditioning (except for a floor fan my daughter brought with her), <br/>\nand through a terrible storm that knocked down many big trees on the <br/>\ncampus, my daughter felt safe and secure and had no complaints.  And <br/>\nshe was most impressed with the food and the kitchen staff that was <br/>\nhappy to accommodate anyone who wanted something different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo do look around and do ask lots of questions.  Ask about the food, <br/>\nand if it&#39;s okay to bring your own along, just in case.  If they say, <br/>\nno, I would be suspicious.  No one else can know what your child is <br/>\nwilling to eat.  And do drive your kid to the camp so that you have a <br/>\nbetter picture of the locale and what is or what is not within <br/>\nreasonable driving distance.  If you can&#39;t do that I would hesitate.  <br/>\nAsk about peer conflict resolution.  Ask about who enforces whatever <br/>\nrules they say they have, and how decisions are made.  Ask about <br/>\nphones and communication, another issue at NBTSC.  In mountainous <br/>\ncountry cell phones often won&#39;t work, and my daughter learned that <br/>\nwith one public phone available for the whole camp certain campers <br/>\ntended to hog the phones every night, making it impossible for <br/>\nparents to either call in on that phone or for other campers to call <br/>\nout.  Plus, more often than not, the public phone went unanswered if <br/>\nit was raining or if the campers were doing something else at night.  <br/>\nAlso, messages left on the office answering machine were not always <br/>\npassed to the camper in a timely manner at NBTSC. <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately my daughter&#39;s NBTSC experience was only one week, a week <br/>\nthat she chose not to repeat.  Her other experiences since then were <br/>\ntwo two-week sessions and another one-week session, and they were all <br/>\ngreat.  So camp and summer programs can be wonderful.  I would not <br/>\nwant anything I have said to discourage folks from looking for the <br/>\nright programs for their children, whatever age they may be.  We <br/>\nlearned that there are many, many camps and programs out there, and <br/>\nthat most were less expensive than NBTSC with much better facilities, <br/>\nprogram options, and better food.  We felt betrayed by NBTSC, and <br/>\neven more so by the other parents who had nothing constructive to <br/>\noffer to try to make amends for what my daughter experienced.  The <br/>\nonly others who were sympathetic were those parents whose teens also <br/>\nwere unhappy and who also have chosen not to return to NBTSC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, just because someone has observed unschoolers and written <br/>\nabout what she has observed, does not necessarily make that person a <br/>\ngood camp administrator.  I have been much happier with the camps <br/>\nwhere the parents were very much involved and contributing, or at <br/>\nleast listened to and allowed open access.  After all, wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>\nlogical to think that some of these parents, who have taken full <br/>\nresponsibility for their child/ren&#39;s education, might have something <br/>\nworthwhile to contribute?  Why should Grace be performing her belly-<br/>\ndancing on stage on talent night, or in workshops, and no other <br/>\nparents allowed?  Plenty of other parents have talents they might be <br/>\nable and willing to contribute to this type of camp, including good <br/>\nfood planning and preparation.  Why all of the sudden should parents <br/>\nbe excluded from unschooled children&#39;s lives?  Interesting philosophy <br/>\nand not necessarily compatible with unschooling in general.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to each his or her own.  I certainly respect freedom of choice <br/>\nand hope that folks will strive for more informed choice about this <br/>\ncamp or any camp or summer program they investigate.  As I said <br/>\nbefore, I wish I had received this kind of open response when I <br/>\ninquired before my daughter went to NBTSC.  She says she would not <br/>\nhave bothered.  She had an offer to be a nanny for a two year old in <br/>\nNew Orleans at a vintage dance conference, for which all her expenses <br/>\nwould have been paid, plus she would receive a set fee for her <br/>\nservices.  And she also had an offer to attend a teen leadership <br/>\nconference in Boston (UU) with all expenses paid, at the same time as <br/>\nNBTSC, and she regrets that she didn&#39;t do one of those instead.  But <br/>\nNBTSC asks for very early committment, eliminating some of the other <br/>\nthings that might come up later.  There are always other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":57901582,"authorName":"nyneca","from":"&quot;nyneca&quot; &lt;evkod@...&gt;","profile":"nyneca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: NBTSC","postDate":"1074785324","msgId":18355,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1b3E3Yys4YTc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ1bWIycitndGNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18337,"nextInTopic":18369,"prevInTime":18354,"nextInTime":18356,"topicId":18138,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Norma- I really appreciated reading your account of a less than positive experience at the NBTS camp.

As I stated <br/>\nearlier, a reasonable solution would have been to form a committee of <br/>\nparents to approach Grace about these problems.  Boys physically <br/>\nforcing a girl to do something against her will is not a small <br/>\ngripe.  Neither is an African American girl facing racial slurs and <br/>\ndriving home in tears because of it.  And last, being served inedible <br/>\nfood, while being told ahead of time that good healthy organic food <br/>\nwould be prepared.  Then facing hoarding of food by certain campers <br/>\nthat went on with no peer or adult intervention was also not <br/>\nsomething that one would expect to have to be prepared for.  In other <br/>\nwords, there was plenty of bad behavior and no process whatsoever for <br/>\ndealing with it.  Just a tough it out attitude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly one parent admitted that her teen did hoard certain food.  No <br/>\napologies were ever given.  The problem, as I now see it, lies in the <br/>\nparents who neither discourage this type of behavior, nor will they <br/>\nbe supportive of helping to bring about any kind of process for <br/>\ndealing with it at the camp.  Grace herself only said, sorry, but <br/>\nalso just defended the way things were.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last situation was much more serious and that may have resulted <br/>\nin a lawsuit, though I don&#39;t know for sure.  But when kids have <br/>\nserious mental issues and they have no one on staff who they feel <br/>\nthey can talk to, or who is readily available to them, especially at <br/>\nnight when these things tend to happen, then things get way out of <br/>\nhand.  Putting that kind of responsibility on a teen who has never <br/>\ndealt with this type of thing before is not what camp is supposed to <br/>\nbe about, not in our books anyway.  This is where adults, with legal <br/>\nliability issues covered, need to be there.  They weren&#39;t.  And none <br/>\nof the parents even wanted to touch that subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNBTSC was not a plane crash where everyone had to fend for themselves <br/>\nuntil help arrived.  It was not some natural disaster where help <br/>\ncould not get there.  It was a private business that failed to <br/>\nprovide an adequate system to deal with all these problems, something <br/>\nwe have not seen at any other camp situation before or since.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, Heidi, how would you know if you would or would not like the UU <br/>\ncamp?  And the issue really isn&#39;t whether you would like it or not, <br/>\nis it?  It&#39;s whether your teen would like it.  The group that I <br/>\nobserved (and any parents were welcome to participate, were <br/>\nencouraged to come along, bring their tents and just be there, which <br/>\nis certainly not the case at NBTSC) were kids who had known each <br/>\nother for years mixing and mingling very well with new kids, kids who <br/>\nwere not members of the UU church, and kids who were just friends of <br/>\nother kids who were going to this camp.  The parents participation <br/>\nwas marvelous, expecially when it came to food, with different <br/>\nparents driving hours to transport meals each day so that we didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to store a whole bunch of food and leave it while doing the <br/>\nday&#39;s activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe teens set up the camp, served the food, cleaned up, did <br/>\neverything on their own.  When it poured rain they either piled into <br/>\ntheir own tents or some stayed out in the rain.  Their choice.  No <br/>\nadult intervened, but we were there if needed.  The adults also were <br/>\nthere to drive the teens to other locales where, for example, the <br/>\nhigh ropes course was.  If a teen did not want to participate in the <br/>\ncourse they did not have to, and everyone was very supportive of each <br/>\nindividual&#39;s decision.  Some teens just tried a few things, and <br/>\ncheered others on for other things.  Some just sat on the sidelines.  <br/>\nEveryone enjoyed the experience, whether participating in everything <br/>\nor just watching.  The teens romped on the beach at night, played <br/>\naround with a telescope one of the adults brought, and did all the <br/>\nusual things that teens do at camps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter said it was much better, and at $85 per kid for a week, <br/>\nit was many dollars better than NBTSC.  Any parents were welcome to <br/>\ndrop by any time, or stay, or camp nearby.  If the kids needed <br/>\nsomething from the store, one adult was always available to go along, <br/>\neven if the teens did the driving (the nearest convenience store was <br/>\nabout 30 minutes away).  It was a great demonstration of full <br/>\ncooperation by everyone.  So please don&#39;t critique something you have <br/>\nnot experienced, Heidi.  My daughter did experience NBTSC, and, by <br/>\ncomparison, she loved the UU experience, as a totally new and unknown <br/>\nperson who was not a church member in this group, but who was <br/>\nwelcomed and treated very well by everyone, and she was most <br/>\ndisappointed in NBTSC.  Same goes for Earlham College, where she knew <br/>\nno one, and was one of a handful of home educators amongst teens from <br/>\nall over the world, but she had a wonderful experience on every <br/>\nlevel.   I had nothing to complain about in any of these other cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest disappointment on the NBTSC parents&#39; list, just as it is <br/>\nwith your comments here, is that rather than suggest any concrete <br/>\naction to be taken by the parents who might be concerned about this <br/>\nkind of behavior (physical coercion, racial slurs, suicide <br/>\nprevention, and lousy food during very cold and rainy weather), the <br/>\nparents just kept attacking me and defending Grace.  And my daughter <br/>\nis even more disappointed about the way the parents have continued to <br/>\nspread false rumors with their kids about my daughter&#39;s experiences <br/>\nand complaints, telling their teens that we have sued Grace.  I admit <br/>\nI do not know if someone has sued Grace, but I know it isn&#39;t us.  We <br/>\njust wanted to see some change, the kind of change that might save a <br/>\nlife, and the kind of change that definitely would make this <br/>\nexperience better for teen girls (especially 98# girls), teen girls <br/>\nof other than Caucasian races, and those who are not accustomed to <br/>\ngoing without food each day, or finding the few things they could eat <br/>\ntaken and hoarded by a few teens without any adult intervention.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all solvable problems, but the parents didn&#39;t seem to want <br/>\nto work together to help solve them.  It was clearly &quot;you&#39;re on your <br/>\nown&quot; and because we were criticizing the Holy Camp we were, and <br/>\ncontinue to be, criticized by the camp&#39;s devotees.  The same thing <br/>\nhappened to other parents who complained, though they just went away, <br/>\nfairly quickly, including one adult who was at the camp the whole <br/>\nsession and who was much more upset than I was.  I had hoped that <br/>\nsome would choose to work for change.  Didn&#39;t happen.  But I will <br/>\ncontinue to present our experience whenever it gets brought up.  I <br/>\nwish I had touched base with someone with a negative experience <br/>\nbefore my daughter went.  She may still have gone, but would have <br/>\nbeen much better prepared.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, I just want to be sure that folks hear the other side.  <br/>\nThis camp is not for everyone, to be sure.  Read Lord of the Flies.  <br/>\nMostly it is for white kids, kids who go with friends, or are already <br/>\npart of one of the little NBTSC cliques who go year after year.  And <br/>\ndefinitely be sure to have your kid take a good private stash of food <br/>\nalong, no matter what the camp web site and information says.  There <br/>\nis no camp store and no way to get any other food at NBTSC.  Unless <br/>\nyour teen is a total omnivore and really does not care what is served <br/>\nat all, this would really help the situation.  And prepare for very <br/>\ncold wet muddy weather.  If it doesn&#39;t happen, great, but we clearly <br/>\nwere not prepared.  Also, there is no laundry, no way to wash and dry <br/>\nanything.  Hand washing is useless when it rains incessantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we learned is that some unschoolers are not necessarily well <br/>\nbehaved, fair, or even nice people.  And we subsequently learned that <br/>\nmy daughter could have very good camp experiences for a fraction of <br/>\nthe cost of NBTSC camp, with even more wonderful new opportunities to <br/>\ninteract and learn about herself, to meet new people and not be <br/>\nsubjected to the kinds of disrespectful things she experienced at <br/>\nNBTSC.  So, do look around and consider all options.  Just don&#39;t <br/>\nassume that because someone who has observed home educated kids and <br/>\nwritten about them (though she has never dealt with the day to day <br/>\nreality of being responsible for and home educating her own kids), <br/>\nwhile they pay her money to attend her camp and be observed so she <br/>\ncan write more about them, will provide the best experience for your <br/>\nteen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","profile":"heidi_wd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] NBTSC","postDate":"1074674421","msgId":18307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwNDAxMjAyMzQ4MzkuMDEyNTAzZTBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzQ2Mjk4MDkuMjY5Ni45NDM1MS5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18222,"nextInTopic":18333,"prevInTime":18306,"nextInTime":18308,"topicId":18138,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They only allow positives there.  Anyone who <br/>\nsays anything negative is drummed off the list, and if they don&#39;t <br/>\nleave willingly they are blocked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to hear any criticism at all you will have to ask on <br/>\nlists like this, and a few, very few, of us will speak out.  Many, <br/>\nbecause of their own experience with the NBTSC parents&#39; list, won&#39;t <br/>\nspeak out anywhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many great camps around the country and we have concluded <br/>\nthat a bunch of unschoolers is not necessarily a good representation <br/>\nof the real world, more like some kind of insular cadre, with its own <br/>\nlittle sub-strata of counterculture cliques.  And just because these <br/>\nkids are unschoolers does not mean that they do not bring their own <br/>\nracist, sexist and other emotional baggage with them.   Believe me, <br/>\nthey do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI admit that bad things can happen anywhere, but if you happen to get <br/>\ncaught in one of those less than utopian NBTSC sessions, like the one <br/>\nmy daughter attended, and you find that the camp and the other <br/>\nparents would rather drum you and any other critics out of their <br/>\nranks than even consider doing anything to improve the situation for <br/>\nfuture campers, you might just end up with the same negative <br/>\nimpression we received.  The way problems get solved or not is very <br/>\ntelling about the camp and its administration, I think.  This one <br/>\njust chases off the critics and figures the problem is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, in retrospect and after much other experience now, I would <br/>\nput much more support into a group of unschooling parents and/or <br/>\nunschooling kids putting together their own camp than in someone who <br/>\nhas been and who remains an unschooling observer, and an <br/>\nopportunistic one, at that.  It would be much cheaper and probably <br/>\nmuch more fun, like the UU camp, and other home educator organized <br/>\ncamps put together locally in our area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still can&#39;t figure out why a camp that claims to empower teens, to <br/>\ngrant them freedom, then makes all their food decisions for them, <br/>\ntotally usurping their power to do something they must do every <br/>\nsingle day. Just does not make sense to me.  By contrast I observed <br/>\nhow the UU teen camp trip we experienced had great food that no one <br/>\ncomplained about at all.  And my daughter found the same thing at her <br/>\nEarlham College two week Explore-A-College summer course experience: <br/>\ngreat food and wonderfully accommodating and readily available <br/>\nstaff.
