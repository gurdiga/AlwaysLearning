But the sad part is that the sorrow, depression and hostility would dissolve if she/they cared more about finding joy than about defending depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that dogma?  &quot;RU dogma&quot;?  <br/>\nIt&#39;s what Maslow wrote in 1943.  There was no such thing as unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  Where I went to find the date (I was thinking it was later 40&#39;s) there was this:<br/>\n<br/>\n****Maslow studied what he called exemplary people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Douglass rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that &quot;the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy.&quot;[3] Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.****<br/>\n<br/>\nThat matches another quote I like lately that I might not be able to find easily.  (I dug five minutes; I&#39;m going to quit for today.)  Richard Carlson, in *Living at the Speed of Life* talks about mental health, and parallels physical health.  Mental health shouldn&#39;t be defined as the bare recovery from mental illness.  Just as physical health isn&#39;t barely walking after a broken leg, it&#39;s running and jumping and being strong, and happy, and for those things to come easily.   I don&#39;t know what example he used; sorry.  That&#39;s not even a paraphrase then, but his point was that &quot;health&quot; (mental or physical) should be robust, whole, and strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Recovery from depression&quot; shouldn&#39;t just be &quot;yes, okay; this morning when I woke up I wasn&#39;t sorry to be alive,&quot; but should be in the sweetly calm happiness to the giddy excitement range.  If an unschooling family thinks they might be barely going through sufficient motions to be unschooling, people on this list will say &quot;But move toward it being easier, and happier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not dogma.<br/>\nThat&#39;s sharing joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199045059,"authorName":"Mica","from":"Mica &lt;mica.meerbach@...&gt;","profile":"micaherself","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning about learning","postDate":"1316575875","msgId":63057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK054Q0daR1JjLVd3TlFoSlhxaDlFU3dUTUZlMXJteHZmWDI5aDZwMGFEYVFKdD1oUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzQUVFQzQ0LUZBQkEtNEQ1OC1BRjQ2LUFFNzkwRjY3MDc1OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEZBRThFOENELTI5RUUtNDI4OC05OEE0LUI1MkNFQUZCMTA5M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBK054Q0daZ1hmNEhiM01WUHlXVnYrUz1udENFYyt3OStwUnJvMG5LQVcwRW1zSzFuUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDUzQUVFQzQ0LUZBQkEtNEQ1OC1BRjQ2LUFFNzkwRjY3MDc1OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63052,"nextInTopic":63062,"prevInTime":63056,"nextInTime":63058,"topicId":63049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah, I wasn t completely comfortable with my comparison but couldn t work out why, now I fear that by placing the comparison after your clarification it seems","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-730803132\">Ah, I wasn&#39;t completely comfortable with my comparison but couldn&#39;t work out<br/>\nwhy, now I fear that by placing the comparison after your clarification it<br/>\nseems like I might have been referring to your own words as a weapon, which<br/>\nwas not my intention...<br/>\n<br/>\nI meant (and didn&#39;t achieve) to convey how, after your viewing, the original<br/>\nstatement seemed less like a rock than a balloon or something that you<br/>\neasily deflated, punctured - but a balloon doesn&#39;t give a sense of a<br/>\nprojectile - and so water balloon.<br/>\n<br/>\nwith your &quot;time release truths&quot; I&#39;m imagining your comment to be something<br/>\nlike a sticky paper-wad coated in anti-virus that penetrates the water<br/>\nballoon to defuse it prior to impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Sep 21, 2011 at 12:09 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I like the way you brought the rock here to look at Sandra - I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; guessing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that the decision was like choosing to avoid a scene in someone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; house?-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t do housecalls, though.
