As in, &quot;Did you know the <br/>\nstandard spelling of that word is ...?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I&#39;m concerned, keeping the &#39;lines of communication&#39; open <br/>\nwith my son is more important than anything else. If I understand <br/>\nexactly what he&#39;s written, the spelling of individual words doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter to me and I often will let it go without comment. Any spelling <br/>\nof any word is legitimate if I recognise what the word is and <br/>\nunderstand the message. <br/>\n<br/>\nAND I&#39;ve told my son that most people in our society regard the use <br/>\nof standard spelling as a sign of an intelligent, well educated <br/>\nperson. Rightly or wrongly. It&#39;s up to him what he does about that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;ve told him is that standardised spelling is a fairly <br/>\nrecent development and it&#39;s not that far back in human history that <br/>\nalmost everybody spelled words as the words sounded to them, so <br/>\nspelling words the same way as most other people do isn&#39;t exactly up <br/>\nthere with our biological imperatives. I read one time, in fact, that <br/>\nEngland&#39;s literary giant William Shakespeare even had at least six <br/>\ndifferent spellings of his own name!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was at primary (elementary) school, I was a stickler for <br/>\ncorrect spellings - I would be mortified if I got an incorrect answer <br/>\nin the weekly spelling test. These days, I read about or see schooled <br/>\nand homeschooled children participating in spelling bees and taking <br/>\nthis attitude that it&#39;s the most important thing on planet Earth to <br/>\nbe able to spell &#39;correctly&#39; words they&#39;ll never use in their daily <br/>\naffairs, and I wonder what the heck that&#39;s all about. I still am a <br/>\nstickler about using standard spelling, for myself, but I know it&#39;s <br/>\nnot as crucial as good communication is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know of plenty of people who can write with perfect spelling, <br/>\nperfect punctuation, grammar and syntax, but who don&#39;t communicate. I <br/>\ndo that myself sometimes.

He has a new computer game called &quot;Rome Total War&quot;.  He is a war history buff - very passionate about it.  He loves anything from ancient times to modern.  He likes all aspects of war - the history (circumstances), the weapons & armor, the strategy, etc.  Anyway I sat down to the computer yesterday and there sat 3 pages stapled together.  He had written about the results of his campaign / battles.  He wrote on a blank page (no lines) and all his physical writing was legible and in straight rows.  Most of the spelling was &quot;off&quot; but who cares ? ;)   All this from a child that is severely dyslexic/dysgraphic who usually resists even writing his own name. (like when you&#39;re sending a card and he does not want to sign it so you have to sign for him)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest caveat is that we almost did not buy that game last week due to money.  We have budgeted for one game or some such big expense a month.   Being it was the first of the month, not the end, the money was not really there, but the moment was.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question for the group is this - he asked me to read what he wrote out loud - and then asked how he did - if it was readable and if he had spelled the words correctly.  I just about swallowed my teeth!  I was so worried about squashing his &quot;spirit&quot;.  I think I did a pretty great job of reading his writing as most of it just made sense to my brain - I think I missed one word out of three pages -  for example he spelled men as min; my as mi; held as hild;  first as frst; couple as copl; etc.  But when he asked about his spelling I was not sure how honest to be.  I think I said something about how he did a great job spelling phonetically and that made reading it easy for my brain - that there were a few words here and there that were spelled wrong or spaced wrong ( for example he wrote hon drid for hundred) and that if he was ever interested I would help him with spelling - to just let me know.

Don&#39;t want to crush his spirit nor be dishonest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso reading to play games and manuals and Japanese anime books (like a comic book in book form) has been what our son has used to hone his reading and writing (typing/spelling) skills.  Rune Scape was a huge catalyst !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I&#39;d be remiss if I ignored the importance of the role of TV and movies in inspiring reading for our son.  TV & Movies, games, and books are all intertwined in our home - pretty much they all hinge upon each other.  For example: He played a Wii game at a friends home that he was obsessed with.  Because we did not have a Wii system, he got the game manual and read it in preparation for when he did have a Wii.  We also have a house full of books he just had to have but has never read based upon his interests or some movie he has seen - he just had to have the Chronicles of Narnia trilogy and even carried it around for at least a month every time we left the house but I swear he never read any of it (maybe I just don&#39;t know - LOL)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29295,"nextTopicId":29313}}
