I don&#39;t make really early appts for anything unless I absolutely have to.  I get up earlier and get EVERYthing ready before I get the kids up, stuff already in the car, snacks packed, doors locked, lights out, all of it.  I get my younger daughter in comfy clothes to sleep in the night before, so there is no getting dressed, just up, go to the bathroom and throw on shoes and a jacket.  Then, above all else I set my leaving time for half an hour before I actually need to leave to allow for last minute things that always seem to happen, so that we make it places relatively on time.  I also, for play dates, give an &quot;ish&quot; next to the time.  I&#39;ll be there at 1ish, so there is flexibility and others aren&#39;t anxious about our arrival.  I also know which friends are flexible and which ones aren&#39;t as much, so the ones that aren&#39;t, we really try very hard to be within 10 min of the set arrival time, earlier if we<br/>\n can.  Cell phones are wonderful for this, so if I&#39;m going to be late, I call so the kids on the waiting end don&#39;t get upset.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to Unschooling Question - Warning:Long","postDate":"1271793064","msgId":53122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVENEEyNTZGLTY3M0YtNDNGNi1BNkEwLTRFNUZEMjA5OEE2MUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxa2N1ZCthcGtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxa2N1ZCthcGtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53110,"nextInTopic":53126,"prevInTime":53121,"nextInTime":53123,"topicId":52980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seriously, not setting anything up before 1pm has made our lives so much<br/>\nmore relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it can&#39;t be avoided, I make it as pleasant as I can.  This means<br/>\ngetting everything ready before I get the kids up. Snacks packed, toys<br/>\npacked, clothes laid out (Megan prefers I put something together for her,<br/>\nZoe sometimes likes to pick her own clothes, but not always).  I get up a<br/>\nlittle early to make sure I am ready. I try to give us an extra hour.  So if<br/>\nwe need to be somewhere by 1pm, we start getting ready at 11am with the<br/>\nintention of leaving at noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also been helpful to get the kids up in stages if I have time. Megan<br/>\nneeds to eat (usually) as soon as she wakes up.  Zoe (usually) likes to wait<br/>\na coupe of hours before eating. So, if I can, I get Megan up & fed & dressed<br/>\nbefore waking Zoe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a doctor&#39;s appointment last week that was important. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsomething we could put off . It is a health issue the kids are used to<br/>\ndealing with and we talked about the need to be on time in the days before<br/>\nthe appointment. And then we went out to lunch (breakfast, lol) afterwords.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;herding cats&quot; thing? It gets better as they get older.  Zoe went<br/>\nthrough a phase where she&#39;d strip *after* I got her dressed. Megan used to<br/>\nhave to have just the right toy before we could leave.  Zoe tends to get<br/>\ninto her carseat very slowly. Megan likes to exit the car slowly. It just<br/>\njust part of who they are. If I leave time for the quirks then it makes<br/>\neverything go much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Apr 20, 2010 at 7:15 AM, Pam &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pambarnhill@...\">pambarnhill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My question: what if there is somewhere you HAVE to be by a certain time --<br/>\n&gt; say a doctor&#39;s appointment?

It is very freeing to ignore the clock and the &quot;shoulds&quot; that relate to the clock. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no harm in the kids being in pj&#39;s until right before you need to leave the house.

I know that my son is usually ready to eat about two hours after he wakes up, so if he hasn&#39;t asked for food before then then I&#39;ll go ahead and start cooking something for him. He&#39;s usually ready for a meal again in 3 or 4 hours, though sometimes he just wants to graze instead of having another meal. I&#39;m attuned to his clock, rather than the one hanging on the wall. My hubby&#39;s working out of town for a few days this week, so tonight instead of making dinner at what time I usually make it when he&#39;s working in town I just waited until I was hungry -- which didn&#39;t happen until 10:30pm. I will tell you it took me a lot of years to get past the idea of &quot;it&#39;s too late to eat a meal&quot;. I go to sleep waaaaay after 10:30pm, so eating dinner at that time of night is not too late *for me*. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there have been so many years of &quot;shoulds&quot; that revolved around what time is shown on the clock, it can be a challenge to break away from that. Take it a step at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Try not to give instructions.===<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped me with this one was to stop and think about what I was about to say, and to question if it really did need to be said. I would ask myself &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;so what?&quot;. If my son had been playing video games for several hours and I found myself wanting to tell him to stop playing, I&#39;d ask myself &quot;why?&quot; . . . why did I feel he needed to stop playing? . . . so what if he continued to play? I&#39;d answer those questions to myself, thinking about what folks on this list would say if I&#39;d brought the questions here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===You can get back to an equilibrium, but not until the pendulum swings the other way and gradually slows toward the middle.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like this, Sandra.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New to Unschooling Question - Warning:Long","postDate":"1271712725","msgId":53031,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxRjc1RUIwLTdGREMtNDU1My1BQTAxLUJFRjIyNjcyMEI5REBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxaHUyaytlbmJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxaHUyaytlbmJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53013,"nextInTopic":53053,"prevInTime":53030,"nextInTime":53032,"topicId":52980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When I was a kid, my middle school had a read-a-thon once a year. It was the only day of the year I was allowed to read as much as I wanted, without being harassed to get out of bed/go outside/do something more &quot;productive&quot;/and then (ironically) go to bed. It would have been amazing to me if my mom had just supported me instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine&#39;s son recently got more fluent in reading and has become an avid reader. She is a big reader herself. Recently she told me that he had spent a whole day reading a book he was really caught up in, that he was finding it hard even to stop long enough to go to the bathroom. She said that she brought him finger snacks and drinks throughout the day so he didn&#39;t have to stop for meals and so he wouldn&#39;t forget to eat. The kind of thing, she said, that she would have loved as a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat evening, his other mom then drove him the 25-minute-each-way trip to the library to get the next book in the series. So cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was enjoying the books so much that day they didn&#39;t ask him to do anything else. They even did things for him like feed and water his rabbits, that he normally takes responsibility for. They wanted him to have this gift of a peaceful day doing exactly what he wanted to do. (They&#39;re not unschoolers, but if they were, they&#39;d be good ones.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And please, hear me.  I like relaxed mornings, too.  But I like to get our stuff done in the morning so that if/when we have places to go in the afternoon I can feel confident that we got something already accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe right now your kids need relaxed mornings so much that they won&#39;t want to go places in the afternoon. Maybe it doesn&#39;t matter if anything is &quot;accomplished&quot; on any given day (I struggle with the productivity demon, too, so I say this with all affection and respect). Maybe that&#39;s something you could work on letting go of.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, you could focus on things you can accomplish yourself. Your kids are busy reading--is there something you&#39;d like to be doing you don&#39;t often get to? Or something you&#39;d like to try?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve also already told them a few times to get up and come out of their rooms.  So, they&#39;re disregarding my instructions as well.  BUT I don&#39;t want to continue with my old ways of shouting and forcing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe try not to give instructions, but express your own wishes and concerns? If I were in a similar situation, my kids all caught up in something, but say we were so out of groceries I didn&#39;t even know what I could make for dinner, I&#39;d say, &quot;Hey, guys, sometime today I really need to get to the grocery store, at least to pick up something for dinner if not to do the whole shopping. When do you think you&#39;ll be ready to do that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even then, sometimes it won&#39;t happen if they&#39;re really not wanting to stop whatever they&#39;re doing. They might agree to eat a strange combination of whatever we have in the house for dinner (hard boiled eggs! and...rice! yeah! with, um, I see a carrot back there...and here&#39;s a jar of sauerkraut, OK, we&#39;re good!) rather than interrupt themselves. Or I might figure out that I can manage a dinner if my partner will stop for one or two ingredients on the way home from work. Maybe we don&#39;t really have to do whatever I thought was so essential to get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, I&#39;m just not sure what to do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let them be. Let less get accomplished. Let some time pass. Try to be flexible about your own agenda as much as possible, and support what they want to do. Let some more time pass, see how it&#39;s going. Try to just enjoy your kids.

If there&#39;s nothing all that cool to get up for, then those days are the days they get all the sleep their bodies need.  I apply that same technique for myself.  Sometimes I&#39;m up late with one kid and up early the next morning with the other one and I&#39;ll squeeze in a nap if I need to.  There are 24 hrs in the day.  Right now, on the side of the planet I live on, I get over 12 hrs of sunlight!  That means that if I want to do stuff that requires daylight, I have a big huge over 12 hr window of time to do it!  I can go on an evening bike ride at 7:30 and still get home before it&#39;s completely dark out.

Do they have any input in this?  It seems clear that they are ignoring your schedule to follow one of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can still continue down that path, be the drill sargeant and get them to comply like good soldiers.  Since you don&#39;t want to shout and force, that&#39;s not what you want to be doing!  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor right now, probably the best thing to do would be to ignore that voice in your head telling you they need to be up and dressed and getting on with the day.  Let them sleep in and read and establish their own morning routine.  If you have things planned for the day, let them know what time they need to be ready to go, and then, you mom, let it go.  YOU go and get everything ready that needs to get ready before you go and do stuff.  Inform them when the time is near to leave, assuming there needs to be a hard and fast time.  Often there isn&#39;t a need for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nScheduling doesn&#39;t have to be a power struggle.  Every person in a household has their own agenda for the day, most days.  Open communication with one another will allow those agendas to mesh together.  If only one agenda, mom&#39;s, is coming into play, there will be power struggles.  Those will only get bigger as the kids get older.  Right now, your kids are applying passive resistance, which is actually pretty peaceful.  Know that it won&#39;t stay that way if you keep pushing your schedule onto them when they&#39;ve got their own.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New to Unschooling Question - Warning:Long","postDate":"1271702534","msgId":53007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1RDdGQTc3LUE0NzEtNDM1Mi04N0Q2LTg5M0RFMTVDRDdEM0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENPTDExMC1XMTJCMkM3OTQzREZDREMyMTBDQjU0QUE5MEIwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PGhxaHUyaytlbmJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiw8NEJDQzg1MzcuNDAwMDEwMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8Q09MMTEwLVcxMkIyQzc5NDNERkNEQzIxMENCNTRBQTkwQjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":52999,"nextInTopic":53011,"prevInTime":53006,"nextInTime":53008,"topicId":52980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve had the pleasure of hanging out  <br/>\nwith Pat Farenga and doing some music (he plays piano) and being with  <br/>\nhim at and around the edges of conferences (airports and meals) and  <br/>\nsuch.  He&#39;s a sweet man, and he worked with John Holt for several  <br/>\nyears.   Depending on the definitions, though, their family didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&quot;successfully unschool.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t speak about his family.  He talks  <br/>\nabout theory and John Holt&#39;s works.  That&#39;s fine as far as it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat might go farther for you is being on a list where people HAVE  <br/>\nunschooled confidently and without breaks for school.  Some families  <br/>\nhere have a kid or two in school, by choice or circumstance.  Many  <br/>\nhave kids who used to be in school.  Some have kids who were never in  <br/>\nschool.  It&#39;s hard to find that perspective just anywhere.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nimpossible to find it even in Holt&#39;s books.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you need some theory and some personal experience and some advice  <br/>\nfrom those who have been there.   It helps to mix those up and come  <br/>\nback for more ideas, and then be with kids and try the ideas, and read  <br/>\nsome more, and try some more.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- They&#39;re not dressed.

When someone releases a wound up  <br/>\ntrebuchet, or rubber-band-powered toy glider, or a pulled-back  <br/>\nslingshot, the harder it&#39;s pulled back, the farther that object will  <br/>\nbe flung when the pressure is removed.  You wound it up and then let  <br/>\nit go.  If you wind it all up again, when you let go the next time,  <br/>\nthey will be flung away from you again.  Some parents do that a dozen  <br/>\ntimes before they figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur neighbors had a dog they NEVER let out and never took for a walk,  <br/>\never.   When that dog got out it would run away.  After a while it  <br/>\nstarted coming to our back yard, playing with our dog. My husband  <br/>\nwould pet the dog and talk to it, and we would stall a while before  <br/>\nletting the neighbors know we had her.  It seemed the most  <br/>\ncompassionate thing we could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur dog has a dog door, and has never gone to that other family&#39;s  <br/>\nyard.
