And I don&#39;t even know if what I believe in would be <br/>\nclassified as a &quot;higher power&quot; or &quot;higher&quot; anything. I believe in the Tao. I <br/>\nbelieve that it connects us all. I believe that many people believe <br/>\nsimilarly, but do not use the same words as I do to describe it. Nor do they <br/>\nhave to. I still feel that connection. We are all part of this world. We <br/>\n*are* connected. I don&#39;t need a set of rules or morals or divine <br/>\ninspirations to tell me how to connect. I connect, by connecting. And I have <br/>\nseen my children act with compassion and caring and selfless attention to <br/>\nothers. All without any commandments to do so. I believe it&#39;s within us all, <br/>\nif we are open to believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1215,"nextTopicId":1266}}
