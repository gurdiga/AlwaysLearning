I feel deeply connected with this because I had a<br/>\nsimilar &#39;breakdown&#39; two years back and needed to be able to reach a place<br/>\nwithin where I could say &quot;I am enough&quot; and I can now love whole heartedly. I<br/>\nstarted with my husband with me but the catharsis that was happening was<br/>\ndifficult for him to handle so we decided to be away from each other. So I<br/>\nhad to move out only to find this place within me and get back with him and<br/>\nmy family. He has been physically away but always been there even when he<br/>\nwas miles away. Because I knew for sure that it was always about me and not<br/>\nanyone else. Life is not perfect and to be hard on oneself in trying to make<br/>\nit that way is the biggest illusion that one can live in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost things we do we don&#39;t &quot;have to do&quot;. But if we chose to do it then to do<br/>\nit with no expectation of the &quot;perfect picture&quot; is living life joyously and<br/>\nwith freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nDola<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Jan 9, 2011 at 4:00 AM, Karen James &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:semajrak@...\">semajrak@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine recently suggested I watch Brene Brown&#39;s Ted talk on<br/>\n&gt; Vulnerability.
