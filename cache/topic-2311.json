A friend had made it his life&#39;s mission to<br/>\nhelp new immigrants and was teaching ESL at a local restaurant free of<br/>\ncharge.  I asked if I could come.  The other students did lessons in English<br/>\nand I helped them.  I did lessons in Spanish and they helped me.  It was<br/>\nwonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also spent some time helping families whose children were in school but<br/>\nthe parents didn&#39;t speak English.  The parents had great difficulty helping<br/>\ntheir kids with assignments and practicing reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if any formal groups would discriminate against a youngster<br/>\nhelping out but it might be worth a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2310,"nextTopicId":2306}}
