Someone has started a  <br/>\ngroup for grandparents of unschoolers, and it looks good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author&#39;s photo was in the e-mail, but it&#39;s at the link below,  <br/>\ntoo.  I know several of you have parents who are supportive and have  <br/>\ngone to conferences and such, and they might be interested in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Sandra, I&#39;m sending you the following in the event that you would  <br/>\nknow of some grandparents who would like to join my group.  I thought  <br/>\nthat getting grandparents together would be a good way to support our  <br/>\nchildren and grandchildren as they UNschool, stepping away from  <br/>\nsystems and methods and fostering natural and independent learning.<br/>\nI enjoy reading your site!  Thanks! Collette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GrandLEAP/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Collette Deneault and I am a retired teacher of 30+ years,  <br/>\ngrades 2 to 8.  I have three daughters and 5 grandchildren ages  <br/>\n6,5,3,2,1.  I was re-introduced to Unschooling through my daughters  <br/>\nwho are Unschooling their children. I first ran into the term in the  <br/>\n60&#39;s while in college. I embraced the philosophy way back then but at  <br/>\nthe time I was young and was sure that I could &quot;save the world&quot;.   I  <br/>\nenjoyed my years in the classroom but after living the reprecussions  <br/>\nof teaching to the test, testing, collecting data, making graphs and  <br/>\noh yes, teaching, I am thrilled to know that my grandchildren will  <br/>\nnot be part of the cloning that goes on in the schools. My last four  <br/>\nyears in education were spent trying to beat the system.  It appears  <br/>\nthat schools just don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Fortunately for  <br/>\nme, three of my grandkids live next door so I am able to be part of  <br/>\ntheir life each and every day.  I enjoy seeing them freely going  <br/>\nabout their day learning. It&#39;s exciting to know that while kids at  <br/>\nschool are learning to count by 5&#39;s etc., my grandkids are following  <br/>\ntheir passions. I&#39;m hoping that this Grandma Group will be a way for  <br/>\nall of us to support each other, our children and our grandchildren  <br/>\nas we live and learn together.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30322,"nextTopicId":30351}}
