She","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1962002317\">Hello everyone, sorry about the previous post being blank, I hit something <br/>\nand poof...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past weekend my little sister, 24, came for the weekend. She attends San <br/>\nDiego State University and will graduate this December. She will then go on <br/>\nto get her teaching credentials. She has always supported my decision to <br/>\nhomeschhol the twins, but this conversation was somewhat different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile driving to the local mall, Kass & Kree (11 yo) asked their aunt if, <br/>\nwhen she has kids, will she make them go to school?  Uh-oh, she didn&#39;t give <br/>\nthem the response they wanted to hear and they let her know it.  She <br/>\nexplained that she would like to have her children in her own class and they <br/>\nquickly reminded her that that would only happen for a year, what about the <br/>\nrest of their &quot;school&quot; life. They were so shocked they immediately offered <br/>\nthat I along with themselves would take on her kids and we&#39;d unschool them <br/>\ntoo. This to my sister who is neither married nor looking to have children <br/>\nanytime soon. However, it is obviously something my children are already <br/>\nconcerned with. They like to do &quot;school&quot; stuff when she comes over, but they <br/>\nquickly revert back to anything goes as soon as she leaves. She never <br/>\npressures them or quizes them but they like that she wants to teach, even <br/>\nthough they don&#39;t think she should send her own to school. They said,&quot;That <br/>\nwill get you a paycheck, Aunt Georgi, but we&#39;re talking about your kids <br/>\nlives.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOMG, then it started getting really sticky. She tried to pull the <br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; tactic and they stopped her in her tracks. Which of course <br/>\nhad me roaring with laughter because they were battling with wit on their own <br/>\nand that alone was closing their case. Then she went too far, she said she <br/>\n&quot;never had a problem in school, she liked it and so there would be no reason <br/>\nto not make her kids go.&quot; The mother bear in me came out and said &quot;we aren&#39;t <br/>\ntalking about problems...&quot; but before I could go further to remind her of the <br/>\nproblems she did have, the twins chimed in with &quot;if you never had the choice <br/>\nto begin with Aunt Georgi, then maybe you don&#39;t recognize what you didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike because you still would have been stuck going.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that, I said &quot;Touche&#39;, Kass & Kree&quot; and we all agreed we would drop the <br/>\nsubject at least for the time being. I did tell her I may have to send her <br/>\nsome Unschooling posts, especially from previous teachers. I have given her <br/>\nmy John Holt books to make sure she keeps those things in the back of her <br/>\nmind, especially when the beuracracy of the System starts to bring her down.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, just felt like sharing, I am always amazed how well my children can <br/>\nalready debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care everyone,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66835036,"authorName":"rjhill241@aol.com","from":"rjhill241@...","profile":"rjhill241","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When family disagrees","postDate":"1049998293","msgId":13438,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMS42Nzk4YjdmLjJiYzcwZGQ1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13441,"prevInTime":13437,"nextInTime":13439,"topicId":13438,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13298,"nextTopicId":13364}}
