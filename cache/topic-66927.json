For anyone familiar with Super Mario, it&#39;s the Reggie level editor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe uses all the level editors we can find online.  This next step of altering the Wii is more complex, and we&#39;re just getting started.  We&#39;re on a forum with a bunch of hackers, so I&#39;m also asking them if this process will cause any problems with other games, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has personal experience with it.
