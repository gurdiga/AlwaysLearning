Before he left he asked me if she had seemed nervous before she left.  I said no, didn&#39;t seem so.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had posted a link to a video on Facebook, and wrote that he thought I would like it especially.  <br/>\nI wrote two things, one before and one after I watched it:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: I will listen to it in a while. Thank you for thinking of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd: that&#39;s really beautiful and clever.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s all-suave response was:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mom, beautiful and clever things generally remind me of you. ;)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce Fetteroll&#39;s husband, Carl, was here last week and Holly was trying but failing to find a time that she and Marty could go together to the college to buy books and get parking stickers, and Holly needed a student ID.  Marty was variously busy, and when he wasn&#39;t Holly was. <br/>\n<br/>\nCarl offered to go with her.  That was VERY SWEET! <br/>\nAnd as it turned out, Marty showed up, finished with whatever he had been doing, just before they left, so Marty went, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was interesting for Carl because he teaches at a community college, and it was more fun for Holly, and everything was made easy.  That&#39;s why Marty knows where Holly&#39;s classes are, because they had all gone together to make sure she would know where the rooms were.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s math &quot;book&quot; is a set of photocopies.  Carl had opened it and looked at it, and said it had something about the population of Madrid, New Mexico (a little former ghost town that had come up repeatedly over several days).<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Marty asked me whether I had looked at her math book, and I said I hadn&#39;t.  He seemed a big perturbed about it, and I asked him whether it didn&#39;t seem good, or too easy, or something.  I forget what I asked. He said one thing he saw was asking them to write out in words, in English, what the population of Santa Fe was.  It showed &quot;Santa Fe: &quot; and some number (probably from this:  &quot;Santa Fe(literally &#39;holy faith&#39; in Spanish) had a population of 67947 in the 2010 census&quot;), and they were to write the number out, like sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven--just to show they understood how to read numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said I thought some people were so disturbed by math classes that they froze up when they saw a big number.  He said, &quot;Yeah, but Holly&#39;s not one of them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agreed, though, that she would probably have fun in the class anyway. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64687,"nextTopicId":64808}}
