I definitely wouldn&#39;t want what I <br/>\nsaid to be seen as in any way related to time out, a concept that I don&#39;t <br/>\nagree with at all.  A better way to have phrased it was to take a break from <br/>\nthe current activity.  I usually just suggest that we watch some TV, and <br/>\nhand them a monkey platter.  If they objected to this (which happens <br/>\nsometimes, but not often, as my daughter seems to recognize that she needs a <br/>\nshort break), we&#39;d sit down and find another way to work through it. <br/>\nUsually she only needs 5 minutes, then she has worked her brain around the <br/>\nproblem, and found a way to solve it so that everyone can enjoy continuing <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit to having unfortunately tried &#39;time out&#39; when my DD was <br/>\nyounger, out of sheer desperation of what to do to cope with her being very <br/>\nupset over what I now see as my attempts to control her.  I only wish I had <br/>\ndiscovered unschooling then, as it really has helped us solve a lot of the <br/>\nproblems that we used to try to solve with time out.  Now that I&#39;m slowly <br/>\npeeling back the layers of control (that I never realized I was putting <br/>\nthere before), she is almost never upset (in the same way), and we&#39;re all so <br/>\nmuch happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think time out causes a lot of emotional scaring, which was really <br/>\nevident in my daughter.  She had always wanted to be close to me, but this <br/>\nbecame even more obvious when we were using time out, to the extent that my <br/>\n5yo didn&#39;t want to be in a separate room to DH or I, even if it were so <br/>\nclose that she could still see us.

That&#39;s pretty standard parenting, after all. It&#39;s pretty normal for kids to repeat that sort of thing with younger children. In fact, its something that comes up in unschooling families where older kids weren&#39;t unschooled from the start, but the little ones are - the bigger kids will start repeating the older parenting behaviors as though they think its now their job. So it might have helped to tell the girl that she didn&#39;t need to be your daughter&#39;s mom/big sister/baby sitter, she could just be friends. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She made a comment when she was climbing that I might not care if she climbed too high because I wasn&#39;t her daughter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, to some extent she may have been repeating other things she&#39;s heard her parents say - I don&#39;t care what so-and-so does, you&#39;re My daughter and you&#39;ll do it My Way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;By the end of the week Mila had moved on to insulting Ella telling her her drawing was yucky and blaming her for letting her markers run dry <br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nModelling is pretty creepy sometimes.

However, there were several situations in which the six year old, Mila, seemed to be purposefully trying to upset my 3 year old, Ella. I am reflecting on the week to think up some better choices for handling this kind of situation should it come up again. I would also appreciate another point of view to sense-check my own reaction. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one week I was in Mila&#39;s home but she was in my care - at least between school and when her parents returned from work. The woman who looks after Mila was either out of sight or busy cleaning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation was that when Mila was interested in Ella&#39;s things she would grab, withhold or run away with them. Then she might place the item out of reach when it was clear that Ella was getting upset and wanted her things back. I think Ella was primarily upset at the grabbing because when encouraged to share and show Mila her toys Ella did so happily. When Mila took away and placed Ella&#39;s toys out of reach as Ella ran after her  I would retrieve the item and give it back to Ella without comment.  Basically I tried to support and protect Ella without putting Mila on the spot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI now think Mila was goading Ella to see what happens when Ella gets angry or upset. I think Mila&#39;s motivation was scientific enquiry rather than malice. I gather that her parents handle angry or frustrated feelings differently so perhaps it was surprising for Mila to see me accept Ella telling me to &#39;go away&#39; when Ella wanted to collect herself or to see me simply tell Ella not to hit me (on the few occasions she was that frustrated) rather than to lecture her on the badness of hitting. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time the week was finished I think Mila was very confused. I wonder if I could have done more to support her. She made a comment when she was climbing that I might not care if she climbed too high because I wasn&#39;t her daughter to which I responded that I would still care. Yet, it was revealing. She seemed to feel that I was treating her and Ella with different standards. In some ways I was - I didn&#39;t ask Mila to share or stop grabbing but I asked Ella to share and stop grabbing. I also didn&#39;t ask Ella to finish everything on her plate while Mila&#39;s caregiver (who was around for mealtimes) did. <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked myself whether it is possible to be friends with someone who repeatedly insults or puts down in words or behaviour. By the end of the week Mila had moved on to insulting Ella telling her her drawing was yucky and blaming her for letting her markers run dry when none of the markers had caps to begin with. At times I felt I might be setting Ella up to accept poor treatment. But, I think I met Ella&#39;s needs to express her frustration or to have whatever item returned. Ella was able to move quickly from frustration to playfulness and seemed to take the good and shrug off the bad. There were lots of hugs, giggles, and playing for both girls. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the incidents happened in the presence of Mila&#39;s parents. On one occasion Mila&#39;s mother told her to give Ella back the item in dispute. On another occasion in the presence of Mila&#39;s parent&#39;s, Ella hit Mila when Mila grabbed her mini princess dolls. It wasn&#39;t very hard and it was on her hands. Ella was basically trying to wrestle the princess dolls back. I  stepped in, told Ella I wouldn&#39;t allow her to hurt Mila and directed Ella to hit a pillow. I had a short chat with Ella about how Mila was sharing her home and she just wanted to see the dolls (even though she had just grabbed and withheld them) and I asked Ella to share the dolls which she did very nicely once she had calmed down. I don&#39;t think she minded sharing them as she really idolised Mila but the grabbing rubbed her up the wrong way. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn retrospect, I think it was Mila who needed more support. I&#39;m not sure to what extent I could have supported Mila except to help make her life sparkly and fun during my limited influence in it. I organised activities like bubbles and water balloons for after school. We played lots of games - directed by Mila - in Mila&#39;s swimming pool. I took them out for a walk with the dog. I took them - on the last day - to the park for bouncy castles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mention any other incidents to Mila&#39;s parents because I didn&#39;t want to get Mila in trouble.  Maybe I should have spoken to her parents about the grabbing. At the time I was also confused about Mila&#39;s motives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what else I could have done to smooth things over. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith thanks in advance for any insight you might share. <br/>\n<br/>\nTamara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60664,"nextTopicId":60700}}
