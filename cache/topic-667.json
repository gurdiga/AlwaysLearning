One is Hindu, and in her 30&#39;s.   The other <br/>\nis in her 40&#39;s and is, in the vernacular, a Moonie.  Officially:  The <br/>\nUnification Church.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a fair amount online, and none of this discussion changes how <br/>\nunschooling works--it&#39;s totally outside of how people learn, in my <br/>\nopinion--but I think this answers the question of why someone would say she&#39;d <br/>\nexpect earlier marriages from Christian homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-In the last several years, the term &quot;courtship&quot; has become more and more <br/>\npopular among Christian circles to describe various methods of engaging in a <br/>\nserious romantic relationship. For some Christians, courtship means an <br/>\napproach to marriage that is almost the same thing as an arranged marriage. <br/>\nYour parents pick your future mate and there is hardly any one-on-one contact <br/>\nbefore marriage. For others, it means the same thing as a serious dating <br/>\nrelationship. You decide to court someone when you are thinking about perhaps <br/>\nmarrying that person.-=-<br/>\nfrom <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://teens.crosswalk.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID74457%7CCHID198\">http://teens.crosswalk.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID74457%7CCHID198</a><br/>\n<br/>\n784%7CCIID894214,00.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToo long to quote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2001/01-01-2001/vo17no01_courtship.htm\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2001/01-01-2001/vo17no01_courtship.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPart of a longer interesting article (citation afterward):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA father’s continuing interest in his daughter <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving fulfilled all the foregoing and seeing his daughter married, a <br/>\nfather&#39;s responsibility to her is not ended. &quot;For this reason a man will <br/>\nleave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become <br/>\none flesh&quot; (Gen. 2:24). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t say the wife will leave her family, perhaps because the transfer <br/>\nof authority from father to husband makes that clear. Perhaps though the <br/>\nfather still has some responsibility for his daughter. Deuteronomy 22:13-19 <br/>\nshows a father intervening to protect his daughter when she is slandered by <br/>\nher husband. Combined with Matthew 18:15-17 God shows clearly how parents <br/>\nmight become involved in a daughters defense. Clearly, great sensitivity and <br/>\ncaution would be necessary in these situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaban said to Jacob as they parted, &quot;May the LORD keep watch between you and <br/>\nme when we are away from each other. If you mistreat my daughter or if you <br/>\ntake any wives beside my daughter, even though no one is with us, remember <br/>\nthat God is a witness between you and me&quot; (Gen. 31:49-50). <br/>\n<br/>\nA father and a son-in-law have much in common. They are both heads of <br/>\nhouseholds with responsibilities of self-sacrifice to those in their care. <br/>\nThey both operate as intermediaries in God&#39;s chain of authority and <br/>\nprotection. The daughter has passed from the loving authority of one to that <br/>\nof another. They are united in their love, affection, and willingness to <br/>\nsacrifice for her. The bond that develops as a result of their shared <br/>\ninterest and position will mature through the time of discipleship and become <br/>\nstrong in shared friendship, love, and purpose. The marriage of a daughter is <br/>\nindeed not the loss of a daughter but a gain—the gain not of a son but of a <br/>\nbrother in Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mistymountain.org/courtship/daughters_article.htm\">http://www.mistymountain.org/courtship/daughters_article.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":660,"nextTopicId":665}}
