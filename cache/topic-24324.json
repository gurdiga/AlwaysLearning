It looks like it&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to be open through the end of April. Most of the exhibit is games to <br/>\nplay. It&#39;s pretty incredible. My kids and I went to the first incarnation last <br/>\nyear. Wow. I was amazed at how non chaotic and non overwhelming it was (I have a <br/>\nhard time in arcades, too much competing stimulus.) It was wonderfully well <br/>\norganized and there was so MUCH to do that we rarely had to wait long for a <br/>\ndesired spot. My 13yo daughter spent a very long time trying to get past the <br/>\nopening sequence in the text adventure &quot;Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, without <br/>\nsuccess. She and her twin brother later teamed up to buy a collection of text <br/>\nadventures from an ebay seller, and spent weeks playing Hitchhiker and Zork. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you can&#39;t make it to Chicago the online stuff is pretty cool, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msichicago.org/gameon/index.html\">http://msichicago.org/gameon/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years video games have provided lots of learning for my kids, both <br/>\nin and out of the game, particularly for my now 13yo son. For instance- he <br/>\nstarted collecting older Nintendo systems, controllers, and games for the systems <br/>\na few years ago. He budgets for purchases, recalculating future expenditures <br/>\nas he gains income or spots a new rare item for sale, or a changed price (the <br/>\nused market being variable and unpredictable). He spends a lot of time doing <br/>\nresearch on recent prices so he can recognize a good deal when he stumbles on <br/>\nit. He&#39;s learned to base his ebay bids on what he wants to spend minus the <br/>\nshipping and handling costs. He&#39;s learned to calculate which combination of wanted <br/>\nused games will be the best bargain when Game Crazy has a buy two get one free <br/>\ndeal. He&#39;s done a HUGE amount of research to find information on these games <br/>\nand systems that are in many cases older than he is, and all of which were new <br/>\nto him. He reads online and read many books on older game systems. He got <br/>\nreally good at using our library computer catalog to order books in from the <br/>\nregional system. He started with game guides and progressed through development <br/>\nand history. Most recently he&#39;s been reading about game psychology and the <br/>\npsychology of gaming, brain research and gaming, culture and gaming - he borrowed <br/>\n&quot;Joystick Nation&quot; so many times I just bought him his own copy*. And of course <br/>\nhe wants to learn to program his own games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t done any directing of his &quot;video game&quot; education. My job has been <br/>\nhelping as and when he needed it - helping him learn how to use the library <br/>\ncatalog and how to reserve materials; suggesting how to narrow searches on google <br/>\nas well as the library systems; supplying transportation to video game <br/>\nstores, garage sales, thrift stores and rummage sales; discussing with him potential <br/>\npurchases when he asked my opinion; bidding on items for him from ebay (he <br/>\npays me when/if he wins the bid); gifting him with gaming magazines and books; <br/>\nand most importantly having serious conversations with him about his serious <br/>\ninterest, where he gets to be the expert and I am an interested participant. Oh, <br/>\nand I play with him, too. It&#39;s a real thrill when I win a competitive game <br/>\nwith him, it happens so rarely. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n*&quot;Joystick Nation: How Videogames Ate Our Quarters, Won Our Hearts, and <br/>\nRewired our Minds&quot; by JC Herz<br/>\n<br/>\nat the same time we ordered two other books we&#39;re both slowly working our way <br/>\nthrough:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&quot; by James Paul <br/>\nGee  and  &quot;Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today&#39;s Popular Culture Is <br/>\nActually Making Us Smarter&quot; by Steven  Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24330,"nextTopicId":24342}}
