Sharing my favorite childhood books with <br/>\nmy daughters and reading lots of new &quot;kid books&quot; that weren&#39;t around <br/>\nwhen I was younger.  I am enjoying reading my dd&#39;s books more <br/>\nthan &quot;adult fiction&quot; lately.  And now I am reading some more <br/>\nhistorical nonfiction books that I would have thought were totally <br/>\nboring when I was in school.  History in school was so boring!  I am <br/>\nreading a book on the history of eugenics that is a real eye-<br/>\nopener.  I don&#39;t remember learning about that in school, and it&#39;s <br/>\npretty scary.  Maybe they don&#39;t call 20% of the population &quot;feeble-<br/>\nminded&quot; anymore and attempt to stop them from reproducing, but I <br/>\nthink that the so-called science of psychology and the drugging of <br/>\nlarge numbers of children is along the same lines - we are the <br/>\nexperts and we know what&#39;s best for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, got off on a tangent there.
