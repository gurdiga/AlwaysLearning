In the geology building they&#39;ve been given<br/>\ncool rocks by professors and shown tons of fossils.  There&#39;s an<br/>\nanthropology building that is like a museum with lots of cool things in<br/>\ndisplay cases.  The entomology department also sets up tours with bugs<br/>\nto look at and touch!  The engineering department has lego robotics type<br/>\nclasses (for elementary age kids) and they were really flexible.  From a<br/>\none day tour/class to setting up a six week class.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other moms and I used to do a &quot;science club&quot;.  We&#39;d do things like<br/>\ngo to a pond with buckets and nets, go to a fossil gorge and let the<br/>\nkids find fossils, go to the science center together, set up<br/>\nexperiments, movies, build forts, make scarecrows, start seeds, etc. <br/>\nMany times we&#39;d plan nothing and let them play and the moms and I would<br/>\nlaugh about all the science that was still happening.  Sleeding<br/>\n(pulley&#39;s and angles), digging in the dirt, climbing on a<br/>\nplayset...&quot;Science&quot; is endless because science is EVERYWHERE!!<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we went on a field trip with friends to a bee farm...it was really<br/>\ncool!
