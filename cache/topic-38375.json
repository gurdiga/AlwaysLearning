She  seems to struggle<br/>\nwith wanting to have friends (like her extrovert, outgoing sister) but<br/>\nis then very picky about any prospective &quot;friend&quot; she meets.  This kid<br/>\nis too &quot;this&quot; or that kid is too &quot;that&quot;.   So, she is in the shadow of<br/>\nher older sister (9) but also recognizes that she is not like her in<br/>\npersonality.  She feels she has to &quot;pretend&quot; (her words) to have fun<br/>\nwith the other kids when get together.  I&#39;m trying to figure this out.<br/>\nShe just can&#39;t seem to meet that special, just-right kid.  She&#39;s happy<br/>\nmost of the time, really,  but I think this is an issue that weighs on<br/>\nher little mind.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Melissa :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38326,"nextTopicId":13198}}
