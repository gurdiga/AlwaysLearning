If she’s not being mean to him, if she’s sharing with him, and he wants to be more like her even though it makes him feel young and inexperienced, those are not bad things.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a bit of feeling that you’re seeing it as a mixed-age classroom, in a bad way—that he should get to be the head of his class without comparison to someone with more experience.   If this is at all related to a schoolishness in you, then step back and find totally different ways to describe it in your mind.  Categorize it as learning, and togetherness, and modelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ghost of another thought came through, and it might be entirely NOT applicable in your case, but could be in someone else’s so I’m going to run the scenario anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes if a parent for any reason likes the second child more than the first, or feels more protective of the second child, they can (without meaning to) create an environment in which the older child feels shushed, rejected, dangerous, unwanted.  I’ve seen cases where the parents weren’t getting along well and the oldest reminded the mom of the partner.  I’ve seen cases where it was a stepchild or half-sibling.  I’ve seen a parent who was not a firstborn child take out his or her own childhood frustration on behalf of the second- or third-born child, but criticizing the oldest.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLet them have a relationship that isn’t micro-managed or imagined by their parents, if you can.  You’re not reporting her coming to draw for meanness, or to disturb him.  And I don’t think you should say “If he’s drawing, don’t draw.”  You might be marring a situation that could turn out really well if you watch it instead of trying to thwart or discourage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337025893,"authorName":"Cinira","from":"Cinira &lt;ciniravlonguinho@...&gt;","profile":"cafe_com_leite_2013","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Siblings","postDate":"1453908113","msgId":76593,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFNzBCN0RELTlBOEMtNDNEMy05RjMwLUY2OTFCQjUyNEI0QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG44OGN1aCsxMnZlYmtvQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":76586,"nextInTopic":76595,"prevInTime":76592,"nextInTime":76594,"topicId":76567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

When I was five years old, my mom left me and my sister to play outside and told me to watch her.  She ended up in the hospital for a few days, while I was left with relatives I didn’t know well who had no children and zero toys.  I was scared.  My mom was terrified.  My sister needed stitches inside the roof of her mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLest people make up worse stories than it was, there was a #2 washtub (a galvanyzed steel tub, round, that people used to do laundry in, and take baths in, long ago), outside, with water in it, freshly set up for us to play in.  Drowning maybe should’ve been a question, with a two-year-old, but my mom…. my mom wasn’t always thinking well.  But there was a little stroller—probably for dolls, but maybe for people.  My sister climbed up into the seat of it, and was holding the handle (so facing backwards, standing), and laughing with her mouth open.  I was five, and too little to know how dangerous that was.  The stroller fell, and my sister, mouth still open hit the inside of her mouth on a rock (the story always was, but I didn’t see that).  I had NO idea what to do.  She was screaming, and bleeding, and walked by herself to the door of the house which was not far, about four yards, and by the time she got there there was blood to her feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom didn’t say “You should have taken better care of her,” but she didn’t say much of anything to me for the next four days or so.   She was at the hospital with my sister.  I was in the upstairs apartment of my Uncle Joe Paul and Aunt Betty.  The food was weird, there was nothing to play with, nothing to draw on.  They had an upstairs balcony with a porch swing—for those familiar with early 20th century southern/western U.S. architecture it was a four-apartment building, big porch, upstairs porch, glass door to stairs.  Downstairs apartments open near the front door.  Upstairs apartments open at the landing at the top of the stairs.  There were tons of those in cities in the southwest; maybe everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had no idea if my sister would ever be okay again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s way too much for a little kid to deal with.  But my mom was young, too, I guess—twenty-seven.  Resentful and defensive.  Building up to some bigtime alcoholism, though at the time it wasn’t there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I say responsibility for siblings, I’m really not picturing whether it’s okay for them to be kind and to offer to play with them to make up for having left them to visit with older friends. :-)  I mean the real life-and-death responsibility, or anything that could create trauma in either of them.  It shouldn’t be their job to keep the other alive, safe or happy if there’s a parent in the vicinity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long story, but it might help someone a little.  And my sister healed, and might not even remember it, and I’m nearly over it myself now. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341538868,"authorName":"Kelly Callahan","from":"Kelly Callahan &lt;ridgelife@...&gt;","profile":"kellycallahancch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Siblings","postDate":"1453815243","msgId":76579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSzhRZjVfQXBEPVRjZjJnRVhwZEZmNHhoRkpwNldfVDRwMVEzWlNMaC1ZX1ZGOGZwZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76578,"nextInTopic":76580,"prevInTime":76578,"nextInTime":76580,"topicId":76567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wanted to offer thoughts on the part about what to do with the younger sibling.

The immediate local options weren&#39;t that exciting either. Sometimes the logistics got in the way, and the many, many other things I offered were rejected and he didn&#39;t offer other ideas in exchange.

And it looked different everytime.

Comparisons are constant. In that playgroup, the parents would point out the best of each child, without comparison. One climbed trees really well. One could do tricks on the swings. Two of them were peacemaking negotiators among the other children, and if there was a problem we would sometimes point it out to them first before stepping in. If an activity arose among children that one child was feeling left out of, one of the moms would distract him with something else fun so that he wasn&#39;t standing there feeling sad or frustrated. Because peace and happiness were our goals, rather than striving for perfection (a phrase I heard many times in school), there was less jealousy and sorrow.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teenager\">http://sandradodd.com/teenager</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminds me to accept and encourage and be grateful for talents in our children.

I need to look at other things. I need to find something to move forward to instead of whirling and twirling around the angsty thing. Make the angry thing small and insignificant, turn away from it, look for bright and shiny things to distract you, look at tiny things that give you pleasure, look at large things that you didn&#39;t appreciate fully the first time around.

We&#39;re the same with regard to not having things be &#39;special&#39; because of an arbitrary &#39;no&#39; response most times. Bit things can still be special :)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow my nine year old and I are going out without anyone else (she has three siblings) to do a treasure trail around our local town. She can&#39;t wait. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also have a date with my eleven year old to make candles and bath bombs together. It will feel very special.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes making a den from which we can watch a new dvd with some popcorn can be really special and lovely. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think creatively. Think joyfully. It feels like you&#39;re stuck in &#39;struggle&#39; mode - seeing this as a problem rather than a beautiful opportunity to connect and do something fun together.

Don&#39;t try to play with him if he doesn&#39;t like playing - do other things. Go out places, bake, play music and dance, play on the xbox or whatever you have. <br><br>And be with him in his pain. You can&#39;t fix it - you can&#39;t make his brother stay home so he&#39;s not upset - but you can help him through it, as well as through any other disappointments he will go through in his life. Commiserate. Tell him you love him. If you are comfortable to sit with his pain with him, it&#39;ll pass. Often children just need to feel truly heard - that their feelings are respected. Of course, you can also find ways to help ameliorate them but not in the moment when they&#39;re at their most consuming - the sort of feelings you describe need hearing. He&#39;s too emotional to consider anything else.
