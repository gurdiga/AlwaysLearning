How else<br/>\ndo you decide who you want to spend time with? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether they let their kids drink soda.<br/>\nWhether they let their kids watch South Park or the Simpsons.<br/>\nWhether they can laugh at goofy stuff without feeling too undignified.<br/>\nWhether they show up on time or are somewhere between an hour and three days<br/>\nlate.<br/>\nWhether they&#39;re nice to their dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess those are beliefs, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure they are. And if people want to judge me or my family on those beliefs<br/>\nand decide whether they want to spend time with us based on those beliefs,<br/>\nI&#39;m all for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want people who judge me on what *I* think of as silly things around<br/>\nme anyway, so they should have at it (and quite likely a bigot or a<br/>\nwife-beater feels the same way -- if they didn&#39;t think they were right, and<br/>\nthat black people are inferior or that their wife deserved it because she<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t shut the hell up, they wouldn&#39;t do it. Or at least they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nput it on a website).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t hush up at homeschooling gatherings when people say,<br/>\n&quot;I won&#39;t allow my children to have chocolate&quot; (I say, &quot;We have a giant big<br/>\nbowl of it available all the time.&quot;) or &quot;I won&#39;t allow my children to<br/>\nassociate with people who own guns (&quot;Oh, really? My husband is a competitive<br/>\ntarget shooter. I think he has about 10 or 12 guns.&quot;) or &quot;I don&#39;t let my<br/>\nchildren watch any TV but PBS.&quot; (&quot;We love TV. Brit&#39;s favorite show is<br/>\n&quot;Survivor&quot; but we like lots of the reality shows.&quot;) Sometimes, this is<br/>\nreally helpful to people who look at our kids and see normal, healthy kids,<br/>\nand are capable of thinking, &quot;Maybe chocolate and TV and all guns aren&#39;t<br/>\nevil.&quot; Sometimes I am sure they run away as fast as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s fine with me if other people want to look at what I am and find me<br/>\n&quot;evil enough&quot; not to spend time with. If their deeply held beliefs tell them<br/>\nI&#39;m going to hell, I truly don&#39;t want to be around them anyway. I don&#39;t want<br/>\nthem gritting their teeth and seeking my presence just because I&#39;m a good<br/>\ndog trainer, or bake good cookies. I don&#39;t want them having to hover over me<br/>\nif I speak to their child for fear I might mention and encourage Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I ask is that people judge me on what I really am. If they find that<br/>\nlacking sorely enough, they *should* move on. If I think they&#39;re dumb for<br/>\ndoing so, well, that&#39;s MY opinion.
