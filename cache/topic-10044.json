There&#39;s a helm with deer horns, and fur trim in a <br/>\npattern on it, a set of pan pipes hanging around his neck, big furry legs, <br/>\nand little hooves.  The hooves I&#39;m particularly proud of.  It&#39;s a pair of <br/>\nclogs with the heels cut off, and the tops painted to look more hoof-like.  <br/>\nSo he goes clomping around on his toes looking taller (and crazier) than <br/>\nusual.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about stationing me at the door to distribute.  Me in a <br/>\nwheelchair on a landing about twice as big as a wheelchair.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re giving away candy (small chocolate bars, Kit Kat and Almond Joy and <br/>\nsuchlike), jokes with illustrations (something I made years ago, and Holly <br/>\nfound the stash of them, rolled up in little scrolls) and Halloween pencils I <br/>\ngot at a thrift store once.
