I&#39;ve never thought about<br/>\nbeing<br/>\nsparkly but this made sense to me immediately. Yes. Right. Be sparkly. That<br/>\nencapsulates everything I&#39;ve been thinking about and working on this year (I<br/>\nposted<br/>\nhere last summer about having started off as an unschooler when my oldest<br/>\nwas<br/>\nlittle but drifting away as more kids came along, and then<br/>\nre-discovering/immersing<br/>\nin unschooling and making a big change back toward &quot;yes&quot; over the summer).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I have kept telling myself these past six/eight months as<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\nstruggled to hold on to YES is to lighten up, relax, stop worrying about<br/>\nwhat other<br/>\npeople think of us or how the kids will turn out and just have fun NOW, all<br/>\nof us<br/>\ntogether. I have this little mantra I think to myself over and over: Be fun,<br/>\nbe fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Be sparkly&quot; is even more fun to say. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit &quot;being fun&quot; doesn&#39;t come as easily to me as I wish it did, or as it<br/>\ndid<br/>\nwhen I only had one or two kids. I have five children, ages 2 to 12, and<br/>\nsometimes<br/>\nit feels hard to be fun when I&#39;m trying to juggle the logistics of keeping<br/>\neveryone<br/>\nsafe and pleasant. (Pleasant for others to be around, I mean. They are<br/>\nawesome<br/>\nkids. But we are a big noisy pack and I do feel like I am always on guard<br/>\nlest we<br/>\nannoy someone or break something.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell when I&#39;m being fun, because those are the good days, good weeks,<br/>\nand<br/>\nthe kids do want to be with me all the time. I&#39;m not always fun, though. I<br/>\nfall back<br/>\ninto patterns of speech, ways of behaving, that I wish I&#39;d never learned:<br/>\nissuing<br/>\ncurt orders, lecturing. I am trying so hard to knock it off permanently! But<br/>\nit&#39;s like<br/>\nquitting biting my nails (another bad habit): I&#39;m good about it when I&#39;m<br/>\npaying attention,<br/>\nbut I find myself gnawing away when I&#39;m not being mindful.
