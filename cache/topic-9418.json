And if homeschooling yields<br/>\nbetter &quot;results&quot;, either in test scores or in personal happiness, then<br/>\nmore and more people are going to homeschoool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I think will happen is that homeschooling will<br/>\nprove that school doesn&#39;t work.  If all the kids whose parents read to<br/>\nthem a lot took them out of school, then I think test scores would drop.<br/>\n And I think all the worksheets and remedial reading programs and longer<br/>\nschool years wouldn&#39;t raise the test scores back up again.  I believe<br/>\nthat natural learning in a relaxed and undistracting environment works<br/>\nbetter than anything in the classroom.  And I believe that in reading 4<br/>\nHarry Potter books twice to my son this summer I &quot;developed his<br/>\nvocabulary&quot; (pardon me) more than my husband did in teaching 150<br/>\n&quot;scripted reading lessons&quot; to his middle school students.  Believe me,<br/>\nwhile I was reading Harry Potter to my son, I was wishing I could read<br/>\nit to a much larger swarm of kids.  (The district mandates the scripted<br/>\nreading program, and this kind of approach has been gaining in<br/>\npopularity in California.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I lost track of my point in all the details. But, I believe if<br/>\nschooly learning is expanded into the preschool years and into<br/>\nadditional homework at night and summer school attendance, then kids<br/>\nwill actually learn LESS.  A lot of the &quot;progress&quot; that kids show in<br/>\n&quot;language arts&quot; during the K12 years is actually learned outside of<br/>\nschool.  If enough involved parents take their kids out of school, it<br/>\nmay be revealed that school learning methods are terribly ineffective.  <br/>\n(Pssst! The emperor isn&#39;t wearing any clothes.

(one of <br/>\nthe butterflies is deformed.  so sad.  the wing didn&#39;t open up all the <br/>\nway and the other wing had holes in it.  the girls decided to keep it in <br/>\nthe net cage (which is pretty big) until it dies, 2-4 weeks.  so we buy <br/>\nfresh flowers and give it cut oranges and i try not to cry a bit when i <br/>\nwalk by and see this deformed little guy.  how sad.  not really the <br/>\nlesson i had in mind when i ordered the butterflies!)  i love watching <br/>\nlexie learn and grow and become.  janene too.  today she and lexie and <br/>\ndaddy made cookies and when janene came up i asked her how many cookies <br/>\nshe ate.  she said i ate 4 first and then two more.  i said and how many <br/>\nis that!  she laughed and held up four fingers and then made my hand <br/>\nhold up two fingers and counted them all.  anyway... this is turning <br/>\ninto a rant now too.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni like to think that it&#39;ll be a bit like breastfeeding.  when lexie was <br/>\nabout 6 months my dad found out that i planned to nurse her until she <br/>\nself weaned and that it could be years.  (i didn&#39;t know it would be <br/>\nalmost 6 years, i figured 3 at that time, but that was way too long for <br/>\nmy dad).  my dad said that as a counselor all the kids he had been <br/>\naround who had nursed that long had seperation issues, major problems <br/>\nwith leaving mom, etc.  he was truly upset that i was choosing to do <br/>\nsomething he felt would be harmful to his granddaughter.  about a year <br/>\nlater he admitted that he was wrong.  but i was lucky.  lexie is an <br/>\nextrovert.  nursing had little to do with her inate personality.  yes, i <br/>\nbelieve that our parenting helped her to be secure but it wasn&#39;t just <br/>\nthat.  so i guess i am just hoping that in a few years my parents will <br/>\nsee that lexie can truly learn in this way, and that she doesn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe bored to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn who will get a keyboard tomorrow--water and 4 year olds and <br/>\nkeyboards don&#39;t mix.  no shift key<br/>\n<br/>\nheather mclean wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just got off the phone with my mom a little while<br/>\n&gt; ago.

I tried to explain, but she,<br/>\nof course, thinks we should have a curriculum & doing<br/>\nlessons & on & on.  So I addressed all the concerns<br/>\nshe came up with & then she said &quot; well, what if<br/>\nsomething happened to you & chris?&quot;  I interpret this<br/>\nto mean, what if we die tomorrow?  So I reply &quot;well, I<br/>\nimagine someone would end up putting them in school.&quot; <br/>\nMom:  &quot;well, that would be so HARD on them if they&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen homeschooled and have never done lessons before&quot;<br/>\nor something to that effect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the conversation continues... about &quot;don&#39;t we have<br/>\nto do testing?&quot; NO.  &quot;doesn&#39;t the state require every<br/>\nkid to be in school?&quot;  YES.  &quot;So if Child Protective<br/>\nServices investigates and finds out your kids are just<br/>\nplaying games and not doing school...?&quot;  MOM!  CPS is<br/>\nnot going to take my kids away just to put them in<br/>\nschool!   I couldn&#39;t believe she said that! <br/>\nI still can&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, rant over...<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nheather mclean<br/>\ntucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n...thinking ahead to November when mom & dad are<br/>\ncoming to visit!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
