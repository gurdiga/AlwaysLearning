Then they clustered these into tribal areas which<br/>\neventually were organized into the 7 emirates by the current Sheikh Zayed.<br/>\nIt was all very hit and miss though and there are still nomadic tribes that<br/>\ndon&#39;t recognize any boundaries or claim residency in one specific country.<br/>\nThese are pretty wild groups of people who are fascinating to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI get disoriented sometimes when I&#39;m in Florida because the beaches are on <br/>\nboth sides!
