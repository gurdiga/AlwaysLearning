My 7 yr old dtr, so bright, so talented, so <br/>\nconfident was turning into a sad little ball of frusteration. <br/>\n  I am so very gratefull to have fallen upon the &quot;unschooling canada&quot; <br/>\ngroup in my desperate attempt to find something, anything to help <br/>\nher. The network of info and support I received was astounding. I was <br/>\ndirected to Sandras site and Joyces, and spent a few wakefull nights <br/>\nreading through the tears. Within a very short time i was convinced <br/>\nthat unschooling was the healing, whole, natural way we were <br/>\ncraving.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Although I trust this process, I too am tourmented in my head by <br/>\nthe opinions and fears of others. ( is it possible to be both <br/>\ntrusting and yet tourmented?? I don&#39;t know)<br/>\nI have gained alot from reading the posts here as well. Yours struck <br/>\na cord in me. Bearing the truth that as we do what we believe is <br/>\nright/natural/healthy for our children/ourselves, we are often in the <br/>\nspotlight. As we do not conform to society and carve our own paths, <br/>\nwe often are targets of tough critisism, often by those closest to <br/>\nus. <br/>\n<br/>\n Reading here lately has brought to mind the truth that no matter the <br/>\nattempts made to mold us as human BEINGS, WE make the ultimate choice <br/>\nas to who we will become. I decided to BE who I am today. No thanks <br/>\nto any kind of box that my parents, school or any other athority <br/>\ntried to stuff me in. And in fact those attempts are what still hold <br/>\nme back today from living in true personal freedome. <br/>\n<br/>\n TRUST. So powerfull. freedome. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo glad to have saved my children from the grips of conformity, and <br/>\nto send them gently into the world as whole poeple. And as I do I <br/>\nheal and become whole too.  <br/>\n Thank you to all of you for your willingness to share in this <br/>\nawareness. Together we are raising the vibration, creating a <br/>\nbeautifull space for our children to continue to cultivate love and <br/>\nawareness in their own lives bringing much healing to this world..<br/>\n<br/>\nOK enough of my airy farieness....Its time for bed..<br/>\nJenny Coburn.....Wink to Robyn....Coburns are a good bunch!<br/>\n <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brooke Cherry <br/>\n&lt;loveascreator@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have endured hours of heated conversation with my father that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sounded very similar to the Nina saga.

Thank you Nina for playing the devils advocate so <br/>\nthat we can see a conversation we have over and over again played out <br/>\nexteriorly. Thank you Sandra and all others who replied, <br/>\nstrengthening my convictions in our lifestyle. When I have this <br/>\ndebate personally, I can end up doubting myself. All I have to do to <br/>\ncome back to center is look at Adrian, read these posts and trust. <br/>\nTRUST folks!!! That is what separates us. We give our children <br/>\nunconditional trust and love. With that, their is nothing to resist. <br/>\nPeople everywhere make choices based upon taking back their identity. <br/>\nThey choose what they cant have or was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  never allowed simply on that basis. Choices that can be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>detrimental, just because it is human nature to resist. We save our <br/>\nchildren thousands of dollars in therapy fees by allowing them to <br/>\ndiscover themselves everyday. We don&#39;t &quot;tell&quot; we allow. These <br/>\nchildren are living in freedom not sin. Those in power have  taught <br/>\nus that we need to be controlled. We don&#39;t buy into it. The people <br/>\nthat are &quot;out of control&quot; are simply resisting and suffering from our <br/>\nsocieties need to control. Unschooled children are the hope for an <br/>\nenlightened tomorrow. They are kind and compassionate. They have <br/>\nnever been set up against each other. I see this revolution similar <br/>\nto the civil and equal rights movements. When the movements for <br/>\nchange were introduced they were not welcomed with open arms. Yet, in <br/>\nboth cases, after all was said and done, we all agree those changes <br/>\nwere absolutely necessary. Well done everyone. No one is fighting <br/>\nNina personally.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-373735979\">I have endured hours of heated conversation with my father that sounded very similar to the Nina saga. It always starts out with him seemingly interested. I enthusiastically deliver the experience of being free. Then, slowly but surely, he continues to ask questions that are not really looking for answers. In fact he is not so subtly, implying that I am living an immoral life. When my enthusiasm turns to a reserved debate, I am turned into the bad guy. He insists that their are no insults intended. &quot;Just curious to know how Adrian is compared to with other kids.&quot; &quot;Just curious to know, when is too late really going too be too late for Adrian.&quot; I take a deep breath and reply, &quot;You sir, were told that you were born a sinner. You were programmed to believe that children are deviant, manipulative and when left to their own devices are bad. You were told that your worth was equivalent to your test scores and praise. After some time in adulthood you<br/>\n reflected back on your childhood. Experiencing mixed memories, varying from comfort to Shame. At some point you had to decide your own worth. At some point you had to backtrack through all the programs of &quot;Shoulds&quot; and become who you are. Adrian will not have to waste that same valuable time. There for he is already ahead of both of us.&quot;. Thank you Nina for playing the devils advocate so that we can see a conversation we have over and over again played out exteriorly. Thank you Sandra and all others who replied, strengthening my convictions in our lifestyle. When I have this debate personally, I can end up doubting myself. All I have to do to come back to center is look at Adrian, read these posts and trust. TRUST folks!!! That is what separates us. We give our children unconditional trust and love. With that, their is nothing to resist. People everywhere make choices based upon taking back their identity. They choose what they cant have or was<br/>\n never allowed simply on that basis. Choices that can be detrimental, just because it is human nature to resist. We save our children thousands of dollars in therapy fees by allowing them to discover themselves everyday. We don&#39;t &quot;tell&quot; we allow. These children are living in freedom not sin. Those in power have  taught us that we need to be controlled. We don&#39;t buy into it. The people that are &quot;out of control&quot; are simply resisting and suffering from our societies need to control. Unschooled children are the hope for an enlightened tomorrow. They are kind and compassionate. They have never been set up against each other. I see this revolution similar to the civil and equal rights movements. When the movements for change were introduced they were not welcomed with open arms. Yet, in both cases, after all was said and done, we all agree those changes were absolutely necessary. Well done everyone. No one is fighting Nina personally. We are<br/>\n universally protecting the unconditional trust and love that we are bestowing upon the next generation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not write this for the group. You already know this story.
