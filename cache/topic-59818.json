I swear it was<br/>\nthere and I guess I&#39;m overlooking it or it&#39;s been taken off. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nDecisions can be made in all sorts of ways. One way is to make them by<br/>\ndegrees, bit by bit, dialing to just the right amount for one thing<br/>\nand then adjusting to a different setting for something else. For<br/>\neating a romantic dinner, I&#39;m likely to put the lights on a low<br/>\nsetting, or turn fewer lights on or turn no lights on and light<br/>\ncandles, maybe a lot of candles or only one big one or a couple of<br/>\nsmall ones. Depending on the effect I want to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen separate settings for table layout and what food to serve and how<br/>\nto present it and so on. Separate settings for any number of things.<br/>\nLots and lots of things to choose from. The way real life is. Think of<br/>\nit as lots and lots of decision making practice for your children. In<br/>\na protected environment where the consequences are not usually so big<br/>\nas they will be once they&#39;re older. They will have lots of decision<br/>\nmaking skills if you let them start now instead of later.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven, especially!, in relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote about Karl deciding how much interaction he wants from his<br/>\ngranddad, and also factored in is how much his granddad wants to<br/>\ninteract with Karl. I WANT it to be their decision. When Karl is<br/>\nolder, there will be as close to zero responsibility as possible on my<br/>\npart for being in the WAY of what others want or pushing something<br/>\nothers DON&#39;T want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking as a daughter who cut her parents off for many years (about<br/>\n15 years, most of my adult life):<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my parents, both of them, tried to influence how my relationship<br/>\nwith Karl would go, I quietly stayed at home a lot and resisted their<br/>\nattempts to get me off breastfeeding sooner than me and Karl wanted<br/>\nto, among other similar things. Now everybody is older and the bond is<br/>\nstill intact, though we have all changed in a number of ways,<br/>\nespecially Karl.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkip to the present. Karl and his granddad are always in the process<br/>\nof dialing several facets in their relationship one at a time and<br/>\ncoming up with unique combinations that each find satisfaction in.<br/>\nTheir own Goldilocks way of reaching what&#39;s comfortable instead of me<br/>\nbeing in the middle of things, feeling like an extra. I used to pay a<br/>\nwhole lot more attention than I do now to the details. I still pay a<br/>\ngood bit of attention, and it has been fascinating to watch the<br/>\nchanges in how they interact. Lots of little things I didn&#39;t expect.<br/>\nGreater respect, for one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above has a decided &quot;wait until you get there&quot; to it. Instead of<br/>\nthinking too much in advance, look at things, time, amounts, etcetera<br/>\nin smaller increments. The truly fascinating part is to be so<br/>\nprivileged as to see the quick connections in the moments they&#39;re<br/>\nbeing made. I&#39;ve noticed that the fastest way from A to B is not<br/>\nalways a straight line. I like watching Karl&#39;s confidence with his<br/>\ngranddad. That&#39;s better than I ever imagined it would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther considerations:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people make decisions, they first might think that one can only<br/>\nchoose between two things and that&#39;s it. It does simplify things to do<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are way more than two things. I like the way Sandra acknowledges<br/>\ncomplexity while showing how decision making really is simple when you<br/>\nget right down to it.... now if I could just find that page on her<br/>\nwebsite that talks about making the better choice. I found a shorter<br/>\nversion which I also like:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe original version I&#39;m thinking of was longer, and a conversation in<br/>\nSociety for Creative Anachronism was involved.

Cutting out anything I don&#39;t want has definitely<br/>\nmade decisions a whole lot easier for me. :D Because I used to think I<br/>\n&quot;have to&quot; include everything in order to make a full consideration of<br/>\nwhat&#39;s before me.

Yes when it comes to parenting styles, etc., but I don&#39;t allow my FIL to call my child a name and not ask him to stop. Right then. (though I&#39;m going to give the suggestion of &quot;I&#39;ll take it from here&quot; some thought.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it happens, we speak up and say &quot;You can tell her how you feel about her behavior without calling her names.&quot; or sometimes a quick, &quot;No name calling, please.&quot; (not unlike what we say to the kids when they are doing it to each other). <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when my FIL called my daughter a cry baby I first asked him not to, and then when he later, away from her and the situation said, &quot;But she does cry over everything, so why shouldn&#39;t I say that?&quot; I said, &quot;Would you like me to call you and asshole every time you and I disagree on something? And would it help our relationship at all? Or help you to see my point of view?&quot; He seemed to get that. (That sounds a lot more impertinent than it was, but I knew before I said it that he wouldn&#39;t object to the language. Being inflammatory wouldn&#39;t have helped!) _Then_ we had a discussion about why she was crying and what we have found works to calm her and get her to think and act more clearly in similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut _HE_ was open to the discussion and initiated it. Had he not, I would have left it at asking him not to call her names. They&#39;re old dogs. I&#39;m happy when they are interested in new tricks (-:, but I don&#39;t expect them to fully embrace them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely agree with other posters that this all seems to be much more about your relationship with your dad than about your Dad&#39;s relationship with his grandson. (Especially when you say Alex didn&#39;t mention it at all.) And if you want your son and father to have their own relationship you&#39;ve got to figure out how to let some of the old stuff go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a quick read if you are looking for ways you can improve the way you view your relationship with your father and change the way you interact with him as an adult.

My mother disagrees with our<br/>\nunschooling, however if a firm believer that it&#39;s &quot;My child, my choice&quot; she<br/>\ndoes her best not to interfere, and when she interacts with Draven she does<br/>\nher best to keep our parenting ideals in mind.  He&#39;s 10 and<br/>\npretty independent so she rarely has to do much even when we&#39;re not here,<br/>\nhowever she has on occasion called me to ask me how I would handle<br/>\na certain situation.  Draven loves being around her and spending time with<br/>\nher, and enjoys going out and about with her, even if she does occasionally<br/>\nhandle things in ways that I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepfather on the other hand is a very controlling grumpy old man.  He<br/>\ndisagrees with any opinion that&#39;s not his own, and he doesn&#39;t apologize for<br/>\nthat.  He looks for reasons to correct Draven, and pretty often my mother,<br/>\nmy partner and I are running interference and making sure Draven isn&#39;t in a<br/>\nposition to have to listen to his grumpy babble.  Draven doesn&#39;t choose to<br/>\nbe around him any more than necessary.  They have lots of common interests<br/>\n(war shows, football games on TV, etc.) however Draven won&#39;t stay in the<br/>\nroom with him to watch those things with him and will instead watch it on a<br/>\ndifferent TV in a different room, and try to avoid having discussions with<br/>\nhim about what he&#39;s seen.  Last time my stepdad took Draven out to lunch,<br/>\nthere was a disagreement over Draven wanting something from the main menu<br/>\nand not the kids menu.  Draven has not gone to lunch with him since, because<br/>\nhe feels he&#39;s not respected when he&#39;s with my step dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father however is somewhere in between the two.  He does correct Draven<br/>\nwhen we&#39;re there (if I&#39;m not right there to step in) and he&#39;s very set in<br/>\nhis ways.  Draven has decided that the things he&#39;s able to do at my father&#39;s<br/>\nhouse (specifically, run around on a huge farm and shoot bb guns and work<br/>\nwith tools of all types) is worth dealing with my father&#39;s attitude.  He<br/>\ndoes however check things through me before emailing or calling my dad to<br/>\nmake sure he&#39;s not opening himself up for a long discussion on something he<br/>\nhas no interest in.  An example of this is that my dad sent Draven a book<br/>\nfull of gun information, and with the book there was a letter asking Draven<br/>\nto keep in touch with my dad on any questions he had . . . his exact words<br/>\nwere &quot;this is a book of questions, not answers&quot;.  Draven knows that if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t keep an open dialoge going with my father about things in the book,<br/>\nmy father will be less receptive to helping him learn when he does have<br/>\nquestions.  So Draven is willing to jump through those hoops, however he<br/>\ndoes ask me to help with the e-mails, which I do.   He does not have a great<br/>\nrelationship with my father, but he&#39;s willing to keep working on it because<br/>\nmy father is so interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the situation is, at what point is your father going to arbitrarily say<br/>\nno to something, and that&#39;s the time that your son decides the minimization<br/>\nof his wishes is more of a problem than it&#39;s worth.  That&#39;s not saying your<br/>\nfather has to buy him everything he likes, but that perhaps your father can<br/>\ncome up with a way to not minimize his wishes.  Instead of a direct no, how<br/>\nabout carrying a digital camera with them so your son can add it to a<br/>\npicture wish list.  How about if you give your son his own spending money<br/>\nbefore they go, or offer spending money to your father.  You and your father<br/>\ncan work together to find some way that won&#39;t harm his relationship with<br/>\nyour son, but will still allow your father the opportunity to say he&#39;s not<br/>\nspending his money on that particular thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, Feb 16, 2011 at 11:27 PM, Michelle and Hub &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michelleandhub@...\">michelleandhub@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then he asked me &quot;Do you think I harmed him?&quot; I told him it wasn&#39;t a simple<br/>\n&gt; answer for me and I would think about it and let him know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Am I harming him?&quot;","postDate":"1297964218","msgId":59829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDOENBRTYxLThDRTMtNEI3OS1BMTYyLTU0NjdEQzU1RDBGREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqaTgzaitnZDFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqaTgzaitnZDFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59827,"nextInTopic":59830,"prevInTime":59828,"nextInTime":59830,"topicId":59818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I keep having small windows where I can answer a few e-mails but not finish reading them.

What I would expect would be that they treat my children with respect. And I definitely think it&#39;s possible to say no to buying something for a child without it being disrespectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your father name-called, physically jerked him away from the shovel, etc., then yes, that would be harmful. But based on how you are describing it, I would think that if any harm were done in this situation it was to the relationship between Alex and his grandfather, not to Alex himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have some experience with this. My in-laws have been opposed to just about every parenting decision we have ever made (and they are not shy about voicing it). I think usually it comes from a position of not understanding, or as you mentioned, feeling as if we are rejecting how my husband was raised by doing things so differently. It helps me to remember that so that I don&#39;t take their criticisms so personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe put an immediate stop to any name calling: my father-in-law has been known to say things like &quot;don&#39;t be a baby!&quot; and they would ever be allowed to spank our children. We support my son in his wish not to be kissed by anyone. But the issues over &quot;control&quot; and feeling like they need to &quot;teach lessons&quot; are murkier, but we&#39;ve gotten better at dealing with them -- and even heading them off at the pass -- over the years, and they&#39;ve gotten better about recognizing when they are stepping over a line. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are all together (us, and my SILs and their families) my father-in-law is prone to acting like the patriarch/decision maker no matter who the children are asking permission for something, and his initial reaction to almost everything is to try and control the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids may ask, either directly of their own parents or sometimes to the room in general, &quot;Can we go outside?&quot; and my FIL will pop up with a quick &quot;Not right now.&quot; We will speak up and say something like, &quot;Oh is dinner almost ready?&quot; and if the answer is no, then we step back in and say, &quot;Well, then I think it&#39; ok if you go out now, but we&#39;ll want you to come in and clean up before dinner.&quot; That way we are respecting our kids without totally disrespecting my FIL in the process or vice-versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy FIL would also never consider apologizing to a child even if he knows in his heart that he could have handled a situation better. If the kids get upset with the way they have been treated we talk to them about it. We speak up for them if they seem unable. We encourage them to stand up for themselves. But we also remind them that their grandfather is doing the best he knows how to do, and that he&#39;s not perfect, but that he loves them very much. We have shared with them that we think each generation tries to do things better than the generation before them, and they were amazed to find out that Pop-Pop was an adult before he knew that his own grandfather knew how to speak English because he would speak only German (a language he and hi cousins didn&#39;t speak) in the presence of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t keep them from getting their feelings hurt in the moment, but I think it helps them forgive him when he slips up. And I think it is an important relationship to nurture. (Were he abusive or truly toxic, I would not, so I&#39;m not saying all familial relationships should be without question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also made it a point to try and have discussions with my FIL about different things that have come up over the years AWAY from the situation at hand. It&#39;s hard to do it without him feeling like he&#39;s being picked on, but we say things like, &quot;Joseph usually responds pretty well to ...&quot; instead of &quot;Maybe you should have ...&quot; it he is usually pretty receptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we also remind them before they go over to their Grandparents&#39; house what the house rules are. We help them remember while we are there. And try to provide them with activities they will enjoy without running afoul of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe the next time Alex is getting ready to go out with Grandpa you can remind him that it is not an expectation that Grandpa will buy him everything he wants, and you can encourage your Dad to see through Alex&#39;s eyes a bit and to maybe provide him time to explore the thing he wants in the store and ask questions about it and talk about how cool it is, etc., even if he&#39;s not going to be allowed to buy it and take it home.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Angela in West Orange, NJ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Am I harming him?&quot;","postDate":"1297962491","msgId":59827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluOC16RS1LLUxlYjB2YlFNZHlmdFZFcnRWOUpSYXRWRU1EOFZRNEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqajUxZittZmwwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqaTgzaitnZDFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aWpqNTFmK21mbDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59821,"nextInTopic":59829,"prevInTime":59826,"nextInTime":59828,"topicId":59818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is there any reason you cannot go to  Home Depot to purchase this shovel?

She was extremely upset, but at the time I felt like my decision was justified. THEN, there just so happened to be a thread on this list about saying yes more, and it pierced me like a knife - I harmed my relationship with my precious daughter by saying no to an inexpensive toy. Why on earth did I say no? It struck me that I will never again have the chance to say yes to buying that swan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t want to over-dramatise, my daughter Ashlin has many toys and I consciously try to create a feeling of abundance in her life - abundant love, abundant attention and abundant resources for her to use. And I definitely use the strategies discussed here, such as not taking the kids when I do grocery shopping, making wishlists, and allowing time for them to look at things in the shop. But I am also much more willing now to say yes to the vast majority of their requests, because I see that those things have value for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in the situation you described, you did not mention the financial aspect of the arrangement you have with your dad when he looks after Alex. Do you provide your dad with spending money to cover purchases for Alex? Has your dad specifically offered to buy things for Alex during their time together? I would not expect my parents to make spontaneous purchases for my kids when they were out together. It&#39;s up to your dad how he chooses to spend his money. It definitely would have been relationship-building if he had chosen to get the shovel for Alex, but I wouldn&#39;t say Alex has been harmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answering your dad&#39;s question, I would briefly outline your own approach to buying things for your son, but would make it clear that you don&#39;t expect that your dad will necessarily do the same. I would say that I don&#39;t think he harmed Alex, but maybe put forward that a child may place a much higher value on something than an adult would, and that it is very nurturing of the relationship to recognise that.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84923330,"authorName":"Michelle and Hub","from":"&quot;Michelle and Hub&quot; &lt;michelleandhub@...&gt;","profile":"michelleandhub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;Am I harming him?&quot;","postDate":"1297916851","msgId":59818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqaTgzaitnZDFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59821,"prevInTime":59817,"nextInTime":59819,"topicId":59818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Folks, This is only my second post, though I have been reading for more than a year.

I could really use some guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy little boy, Alex, age 4.5, spends one or two Saturdays a month with my Dad.  After last week&#39;s visit, my Dad shared this story with me:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were at Home Depot, first for a kids&#39; build-it workshop, then to browse around the store.  Alex spotted a hand shovel and told my Dad he wanted it.  Not just any shovel, but one with an extendable handle. Alex has been very intrigued by things with extendable handles lately, and I have bought several such things when we&#39;ve been out and he&#39;s asked to have them.  I&#39;m sure my Dad knew this, but I don&#39;t know if he remembered at the time they were at Depot.  Alex asked for the shovel and my Dad told him No, because he already has shovels at home.  Alex asked again and my Dad pulled the &quot;If you have money in your pocket you can buy it&quot; card.  At this, apparently Alex started to cry because he did not have any money.  He even thought to say something like, &quot;You could loan me the money and I will pay you back.&quot;  Still the answer was No.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAround the corner it was the same scene, only this time with snowblowers.  My Dad clearly saw this as evidence that we (his parents) don&#39;t ever say no to him, because see how quickly it escalated from hand shovels to snowblowers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Dad noted to me that they were planning to go to another store after lunch and he was going to buy a new Lego set for them to work on that afternoon.  I asked if he thought it could have helped to remind Alex of that plan.  His answer was a curt, &quot;No, I don&#39;t.  I think at that moment he needed to learn that he doesn&#39;t always get whatever he wants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t ask me how I might have handled this situation, but I told him anyway.  I told him I plan my trips and my budget and my time around buying things he asks for as often as possible.  When we have a tight budget or tight time I leave Alex home a lot so he doesn&#39;t have to hear No a lot.  That got an accusation that has been thrown in my face before: &quot;You tend to want to take the Easy Way Out.&quot;  (He said that about babywearing, bed sharing, extended nursing, not giving him a sibling, not leaving him with more babysitters, not letting him sleep over, not sending him to school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a deep breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked was the shovel too expensive?  No.  I asked if Alex had been misbehaving in the store, thinking maybe my Dad was withholding the shovel as a punishment.  No.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no good reason for not buying the shovel, except that my Dad decided Alex had enough shovels already, and this would be a good time for a lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kicker?  When they got to Kmart after lunch and Alex picked a Lego set, he also spied a little train set and my Dad said &quot;I thought that looked cool too so we got both.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took another deep breath, and chose not to point out that HE got to decide that something looked cool so he bought it, but ALEX needed to be taught a lesson.  I&#39;m sure that would have gotten me the &quot;When he goes to work and earns the money he can buy his own shovel&quot; speech that I got some version of dozens of times growing up.<br/>\n  <br/>\nI did ask him to think about &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you have said yes?  What would have happened if you had bought the shovel?&quot;  He really believes it&#39;s about the Someday down the road when he asks his boss for a raise, he needs to be able to handle being told No.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he asked me &quot;Do you think I harmed him?&quot;  I told him it wasn&#39;t a simple answer for me and I would think about it and let him know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I think, without anyone&#39;s feedback:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think in the short run, yes, Alex was harmed.  He was treated with disrespect, and that&#39;s harmful to a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the long run, I think it&#39;s what happens most of the time that counts.  Most of the time Alex spends with me and my husband.  We are learning to say yes as often as we can.  We are relaxing controls.  We are rethinking everything we&#39;ve been taught.  Quite honestly, my Dad resents how we&#39;re parenting (me mostly; he thinks my husband is just coming along for the ride) because it&#39;s mostly the opposite of how we were raised, which he takes as an affront to him. He feels defensive, and ends up  speaking to me regularly with an attitude of &quot;Thank goodness Alex has me, or else he&#39;d never learn any of the important things in life from you two.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I&#39;m reaching out to the Group for feedback:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tDo you think Alex was harmed at Home Depot?<br/>\n2.\tHow would you suggest I answer my Dad&#39;s question &quot;Do you think I harmed him?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60004,"nextTopicId":60029}}
