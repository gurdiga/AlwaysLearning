When I signed on with our community food pantry, I was assigned the position of &#39;food pantry coordinator&#39;. So being the excited, anxious do/gooder that I am, I quickly jotted off an email to everyone on the list telling them that I was the new &#39; food panty coordinator&#39;. Yep! You read that right. I accidentally put &#39;panty&#39; instead of &#39;pantry&#39; and naturally spellcheck didn&#39;t pick it up! Of course, I didn&#39;t realize that I had done this until patrons starting coming in the library ( where I was the librarian) to ask if I was the new &#39;food panty coordinator&#39;! Don&#39;t you just LOVE those typos!

Julian is enjoying the <br/>\nvicarious thrill of watching Degrassi Jr. High (Beth and I are too) and 24/7, <br/>\nboth about teens in school, one in Canada, one in England. Neither has any <br/>\nimpact on his wanting to go to school, but it&#39;s fun anyway. (They also run <br/>\nDaria, which we all love.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDegrassi (it&#39;s a new one, based on the one that ran a while ago, with some <br/>\nsame characters) is interesting. They cover issues never done here in a cool <br/>\nway, like teens and sexuality, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9784,"nextTopicId":9788}}
