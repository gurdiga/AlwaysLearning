I have 4 sons and all but one have left home. <br/>\nFortunately for me, they all live close - the furtherest lives 2 1/2 <br/>\nhours away. My eldest son did do a 2 year stint at the bottom of the <br/>\nSouth Island of New Zealand at one stage (Winton, near Invercargil, for <br/>\nthose who love to pull out the maps and follow things) and that was hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it is exciting and happy - and scary and sad. Such a mix of <br/>\nfeelings. But because you have been the sort of mother you have, they <br/>\nwill keep in touch, and visit and you will be welcome at their place. <br/>\nPhones and e-mails and msm and texting and even an occasional snail mail <br/>\nletter - all keep me close to mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy #2 son Steve (23), moved 2 1/2 hours away at the beginning of the <br/>\nyear to start a degree in Performance Jazz (saxophone, and also now <br/>\ntaking up flute). One of his best friends, James (21) (homeschooled) has <br/>\ngone too, and they are living together, along with Steve&#39;s partner, <br/>\nHeidi (also home/unschooled). Last week my youngest son Jeff (17), had <br/>\nto perform in the New Zealand Brass Band National competitions near <br/>\nwhere the kids are living. It&#39;s a tiny flat but we were welcome to stay. <br/>\nWe had been very very busy for the previous month, and I had not been <br/>\nlooking forward to this trip. We got to the flat just after lunch and my <br/>\nson and his girlfriend weren&#39;t there but Jeff and I just spent the <br/>\nafternoon hanging out with James and his visiting girlfriend. By the <br/>\ntime Jeff had had his 2 hour band practice, Steve and Heidi were home <br/>\nand all 6 of us went to the movies together (Blades of Glory). The next <br/>\nmorning was the competition (or Jeff&#39;s part of it) and then we went back <br/>\nto the flat to get our things and say goodbye. Except it was a grey, <br/>\nrainy day outside and inside we were so welcome, and the talk was good. <br/>\nI spent a couple of hours talking to Steve, a couple more with Heidi, <br/>\nJames tore himself away from his girlfriend (schooled) a couple of times <br/>\nto come sit next to me and have a hug (the schooled girlfriend seemed a <br/>\nlittle stunned but was ok about it!) - so eventually we got away about <br/>\n5.30. It was the most relaxing, lovely two days!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I discovered is that though I have &#39;lost&#39; a son and 2 friends - <br/>\nI have gained an extra home. I felt completely welcome and at home in <br/>\ntheir flat (apartment?) How many 55yo women can say that? And it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night all three arrived here, refugees from the storms in the north <br/>\n- they had no power water or heating up there so all three came here. <br/>\nThey chose to come here rather than to the homes of either of the <br/>\nothers. I am soooooooo lucky :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI reckon that&#39;s the way it will be for you. And you know, although I <br/>\nmiss them so very much, at times like these, when they choose me over <br/>\nother options, that just fills me with such joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185618401,"authorName":"cyrusnmayasmama","from":"&quot;cyrusnmayasmama&quot; &lt;bluemoon@...&gt;","profile":"cyrusnmayasmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a question from Kirby","postDate":"1184186508","msgId":29822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3M2ZhYytrNG8zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNiNjQwZmM3ZDk0MzE5Nzc0NDA5YzcwZWE0YzI1YWM4QGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":29821,"nextInTopic":29823,"prevInTime":29821,"nextInTime":29823,"topicId":29790,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When I was <br/>\nsettled in Los Angeles, she shipped them to me (on a pallet). But the key <br/>\npoint is that they were pre-packed into liftable sized boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I travelled in Australia, I always took those things that had personal <br/>\nmeaning to me - my books and my sewing machine. How quickly is Kirby to <br/>\nreport for work upon arrival? Perhaps he would need an iron if he has to <br/>\niron his work shirt. I would pack a towel for the shower and my personal <br/>\ntoiletries.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Austin is anything like where I live (close to a college) Kirby might be <br/>\nable to furnish a lot of his apartment via the back alleys of apartment <br/>\nbuildings. We are constantly noticing very nice furniture put out back for <br/>\nevery room, and indeed have done the same ourselves. One day I saw a <br/>\ndistinctively shaped sofa in one alley, while the matching loveseat was in <br/>\nanother alley - I imagine that the set was originally put out together but <br/>\nhas been split up and recycled around different apartments over time. When I <br/>\nput out our old dining set, someone approached me even as I was carrying it <br/>\nout and wanted it. It&#39;s better than Craig&#39;s List, our alley!<br/>\n<br/>\nAustin has plenty of thrift stores as I recall as well as an artsy vibe. I <br/>\nremember one slightly shady character who nonetheless could tell me where I <br/>\ncould find just about anything I needed for the film I was working on, <br/>\nincluding a stuffed armadillo for very little money - Virgil Borders at All <br/>\nAmerican Recycling. He had a junk yard that was one of the exterior <br/>\nlocations for &quot;Love and a .45&quot;. Everyone was extremely helpful to the film. <br/>\nThe Department of Roads (or whatever it was called) made up a bunch of <br/>\ncustom road signs for me, and when I went to ask how much they cost, were <br/>\nsurprised and said they were free! Now that doesn&#39;t happen in Los Angeles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would always say to have a microwave, but sometimes (rarely) they are <br/>\nincluded in apartments.
