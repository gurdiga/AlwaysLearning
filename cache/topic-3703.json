I asked him how was anyone going to be able to hurt us just be knowing our name?  He had some answer that didn&#39;t make sense to me at the time but I guess I internalized his feelings.  I&#39;m glad to hear from all of you sensible folks.  I&#39;m learning to trust my own instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I made chocolate chip cookies.  About 10 min. before dinner my dd asked if she could have one.  I told her I was not going to tell her what to do but explained my thinking on the matter.  She decided to wait.  My dh said &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t ask me because you probably would have been sent to your room after throwing a fit about not being *allowed* to have a cookie&quot;.  Later on that night he told me he had a talk with my dd about how smart her mother is.  I think I can get used to this new status!<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"dacunefare@aol.com","from":"dacunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Internet safety WAS kids dating","postDate":"1012544545","msgId":3703,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOS5iYzU3NmFiLjI5OGI4ZTIxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3737,"prevInTime":3702,"nextInTime":3704,"topicId":3703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Another reason is my dh is really convinced that you must protect your identity from people on the internet.

In <br/>\nthe case of kids, it takes the focus off the REAL dangers and gives a false <br/>\nsense of security. Kids aren&#39;t in danger of being stolen away by some <br/>\nstranger who learns their name and where they live and sneaks up behind them <br/>\none day as they walk innocently along. Kids are in danger from predators who <br/>\nslyly work themselves into their confidence and lure them away while <br/>\nencouraging them to hide from and lie to their parents. Doesn&#39;t insisting our <br/>\nkids lie to others about themselves set a poor precedent? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for adults, I think most of the nastiness to be found online is being <br/>\nperpetrated by people hiding behind anonymity. I don&#39;t want to be mistaken <br/>\nfor one of them. And I don&#39;t believe that having people know who I am and <br/>\nwhere I live is inherently dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3565,"nextTopicId":3736}}
