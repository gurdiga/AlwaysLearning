But","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1757279066\">I cut the e-mail I was working on in two because Katherine objected  <br/>\nto long e-mails.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents come to this list and they want to be children here.   <br/>\nBut the purpose of this list is to discuss unschooling in ways that  <br/>\nwill help those who come to read.  I was reminded recently that for  <br/>\nany discussion about one situation here, two hundred people probably  <br/>\nbenefit.  It&#39;s very likely.  Of the 1800 or so people listed, I  <br/>\nfigure 300-400 forgot they were on the list, another 200 might be  <br/>\nduplicates or bounces, and that still leaves 1000 and some reading.    <br/>\nSome scan for their favorite topics, or check in when it gets really  <br/>\nbusy to see what the excitement way.  Of those who do find life- <br/>\nchanging benefit, some write about it on their blogs and some to  <br/>\ntheir friends and some actually e-mail me and say something.  Those  <br/>\nare collected (not all of them, but some) here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/feedback\">http://sandradodd.com/feedback</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo of that large number there are a few who are deeply angsty about  <br/>\nsomething or another.  Some have unresolved or unexamined childhood  <br/>\nissues.  Some are living with some dishonesty that&#39;s making them  <br/>\ntouchy.  Some are afraid for real or imagined reasons.  Some of that  <br/>\nmakes it difficult for them to contribute materially or substantially  <br/>\nto an unschooling discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think mental health can come from unschooling and sometimes people  <br/>\nfor the first time in their lives feel right and good and whole, when  <br/>\nunschooling is going well.  And by mental health I don&#39;t mean just  <br/>\nthe absence of mental illness, I mean vibrant, strong,  FULLness.     <br/>\nJoyous strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think successful unschooling can produce joy and health.<br/>\nAnd I think this list can help people get to successful unschooling.<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the purpose of this list to get people to  <br/>\nmental health.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when people are needy and insecure, we can help them with  <br/>\nunschooling, but those other needs should probably be dealt with in  <br/>\nplaces designed for that (IF the needs are really deep):  church, 12  <br/>\nstep programs, some kind of therapy, for the good of the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38814,"nextTopicId":38652}}
