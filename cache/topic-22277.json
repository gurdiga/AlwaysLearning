My 7 yo ds is much more <br/>\ncomfortable with computer games as well, although he has just this <br/>\nweek - on his 3rd try - been able to erect a small lego structure <br/>\nusing the actual small legos. My ds is like dh in that he has large <br/>\nfingers that arn&#39;t good for really small things without a lot of <br/>\nwork. Although he will get frustrated at either when things aren&#39;t <br/>\ngoing as planned. <br/>\n   I think I am starting to see his &quot;plan&quot; emerging though - if he <br/>\ngets too frustrated then he quits, then later he either comes back & <br/>\ntrys it again (IF it is important to him otherwise he may have just <br/>\nquit it for good -for now) and sometimes he will even get frustrated <br/>\nagain, sometimes he will ask for help (occasionally I will ask him <br/>\nif he wants help as well, but most of the time he gives me a brick <br/>\nwall and I am becoming confident in his ability to ask me for what <br/>\nhe needs as he becomes older as well, but I also like for him to <br/>\njust know that I&#39;m available for him.) Anyhow if it is important to <br/>\nhim (I should probably add &quot;at the time&quot; as well because sometimes <br/>\nhe will quit something for months or years before trying again) he <br/>\nwill work at it until he gets it, even if that means quiting several <br/>\ntimes. <br/>\n    When he was younger I got upset at him when he quit and he quit <br/>\na LOT (in my opinion then) like baseball, soccar, gymnastics, <br/>\nswimming lessons, etc. But now I&#39;m pretty happy that I did listen to <br/>\nhim and let him quit, although I think I could have even been more <br/>\naccepting of it, as I am learning to be now that I see his &quot;plan&quot;. I <br/>\nam so happy to have figured that out! I think children handle <br/>\nfrustration differently but if we follow their lead then we can <br/>\nlearn how we can be more helpful to them.

It seems that a child raised with respect, <br/>\nin a fun, caring unschooling home would be way more impacted by that <br/>\nenvironment than whatever virtual game they may play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think there is alot of hysteria out there...i was watching <br/>\nsome news program in which a man was being interviewed <br/>\nabout &quot;keeping our kids safe from videogames&quot; or something, and his <br/>\nexample of the evils of videogames was some porn-type game that you <br/>\ncan get online that i&#39;ve never heard of. Thats not what kids are <br/>\nplaying. Its like saying kids shouldnt read magazines because <br/>\nHustler is really bad for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] video games and violence","postDate":"1118184326","msgId":22279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMS40YmJjNTJjOC4yZmQ3N2Q4NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22278,"nextInTopic":22280,"prevInTime":22278,"nextInTime":22280,"topicId":22277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/2005 3:50:11 PM Mountain Daylight Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: Don t.

To make it useful, though,  you <br/>\nneed to think of some other places where teens hang out and go there and  look <br/>\nat them there too.  See who seems peaceful and thoughtful and  courteous.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re going  to the Live and Learn conference, find Kirby or  Marty, and <br/>\nsee what you think.   YEARS of video game playing.   Try to piss them off, if <br/>\nyou want to, and see if they get violent.  Hit  them and see if they hit back. <br/>\n I won&#39;t warn them, because that would mar  the science of your exploration.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust two nights ago, Marty came in and said the online games are becoming  <br/>\nfashion shows, and that Kirby and his clan were in there designing matching  <br/>\npirate outfits for themselves on World of Warcraft.    One of  Holly&#39;s favorites <br/>\nof the past few months is a group game called Karaoke  Revolution.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nplayed.  The first thing you do is name your  character, choose what you&#39;ll look <br/>\nlike, and pick some clothes.  One of the  things you can gain by playing well is <br/>\nmore choices of clothes.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis probably developed out of games where you could choose which character  <br/>\nyou wanted to be, such as Mario 2, where you could be Mario or Luigi or the  <br/>\nPrincess or Yoshi (I think).  Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, let  you <br/>\nchoose your persona.  And Kirby just said &quot;All of these games do,&quot; and  <br/>\ngestured in such a way as I think he meant Halo 2, World of Warcraft,  Morrowind.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn my experience with people who have grown up to be violent, they were  <br/>\neither tormented physically or verbally, they were controlled and limited, they  <br/>\nwere made to feel small, they were shamed, punished and spanked.  Unless  <br/>\nviolence came along sometime after video games, it is ludicrous to blame  violence <br/>\non that, particularly when schools have never been so controlling,  limiting, <br/>\nsmall-making and punishing of older kids before now.  When  schools were new, <br/>\nit was not at all unusual for people to go for a couple or  three years and <br/>\ndrop out after they learned to read and learned some math.   Three of my four <br/>\ngrandparents dropped out in what would now be considered  elementary school.  <br/>\nOne finished high school.  Both my parents dropped  out in what would be <br/>\nconsidered high school.  By then (the 40&#39;s) people had  to be pregnant to get out of <br/>\nschool earlier than 15 or so, and some got pregnant  just to get the heck out <br/>\nof there, I hear.   My sister dropped  out.<br/>\n <br/>\nNone of those people would nowadays be legally allowed to stop going to  <br/>\nschool.  They would keep them until they were 18.  Home lives are  adjusted to <br/>\nmatch, and 17 and 18 year old boys are treated like little  children.   When that <br/>\nnaturally and understandably makes kids violent,  the schools and the parents <br/>\nlove to blame TV, movies and video games.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s really okay to think, to look around and SEE directly without anyone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s interpretation what IS oppressive and what is not.  You don&#39;t need  to <br/>\nshop for an expert.  You can become a direct observer of your son and of  the <br/>\nbehaviors around you.  If something seems like bullshit, look at it  critically <br/>\nand curiously and turn it around and look at the back, and at its  history, <br/>\nand at the motivation of its maker.  Don&#39;t reject it whole and go  to the next <br/>\nexpert.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22198,"nextTopicId":22302}}
