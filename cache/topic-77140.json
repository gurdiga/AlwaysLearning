Luckily, not missing much! Myself and three girls were as you have described- top of the class, anytime, players in the game, marked down for too much socializing ( out of boredom?)  or not backing up everything the teacher says....for thinking critically. The school used to tell us, &quot;What are you doing at home?? Your kids like home more than school- we have never encountered that!&quot; Sad but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter five years (guesstimated- it is all just a happier flow in my mind, a progression towards calmer more loving and satisfying days) everyone has found interests and passions they are freely following. Most of it would not fit on Devyn&#39;s report card; most of it doesn&#39;t count...<br/>\nMy oldest just turned 18. She is so grateful we changed when we did, she knows how she wants to spend her time, and right now, the university does not offer things she wants to study. She wants it on her terms, so she decided she is not willing to put in the hours with the really boring stuff (to her) for 8 years, when she can do field biology freelance, with our funding and making her own connexions. Art is big,too. <br/>\nRabaab is doing graphic art with her new laptop ( early birthday present combined with her savings), and working when she asks for it with Dad on higher math for exams to enter uni on a few years ( she is entertaining studying architecture and wants to be prepared, her idea). She has always been a planner ☺️. Zaynab is really into everything to do with gaming, and I mean technical specs and actually playing. She also reads and hikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking bread, caring for pets, gaming, picking wild berries, tracking scat, scouting out new eagle territory- none of this fits into &quot;school&quot;. All of it is done as often as possible around here, all of it enriches our live in more ways than one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Sandra for providing the patient guideposts at the beginning to help us onto the road to more peace joy and creativity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On May 31, 2016, at 1:39 AM, Sandra Dodd <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After nearly 30 years of no association with schools, I’m slightly involved with the school attendance (delivery, summer child care) of “a second grader” (who just finished first grade).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Devyn is Kirby’s fiancee’s daughter.
