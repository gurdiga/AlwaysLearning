So <br/>\nthis is not about race vs. race. My comment was about how subtle and <br/>\ningrained prejudices can be that, those who consider themselves <br/>\nprogressive have not reckoned with what gets them in the same band <br/>\nwagon than those who hide under hooded sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest example? My using the word Jew to describe people and not to <br/>\nrefer to a person who believes in Judaism. Notice that I do not refer <br/>\nto Judaism as a race since I have a problem with calling Jews a race <br/>\nbecause, obviously, they come in many colors, flavors and sizes <br/>\n--Ethiopian and Chinese Jews come to mind. Now I can make that <br/>\nopinion because I have had to reckoned with my (I do not what to call <br/>\nit) passive/latent/unconscious prejudice. That prejudice was so <br/>\nnatural to me that I grew up hearing about the heroes of the Civil <br/>\nRights Movement and yet had no idea how antisemite I was. Not out of <br/>\nhatred but pure ignorance.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments like Tucker&#39;s do not come out of hatred but out of <br/>\nignorance. She wants to the right thing but she still cannot go past <br/>\nthe &quot;all the people her color/race/culture as money from me&quot; because <br/>\nthey are still all lumped together. It&#39;s the &quot;all Chinese people look <br/>\nthe same syndrome&quot;. It is when we are in the position of dealing <br/>\nintimately with a person from another race or ethnicity that these <br/>\nthings come out to fore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can you do? Nothing. Just keep a note of it. If this is a <br/>\nsituation, or a thought, or an action or even a conversation that has <br/>\nhappened more than once in your life, then you could take it as a <br/>\nlittle wake-up call. We all could, BTW. Tucker&#39;s is an example of <br/>\nwhat happens to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not about being good or bad. Prejudice is two steps away from <br/>\nbigotry but one step closer to resentment. The resentment that says, <br/>\n&quot;well two people did this to me so obviously all people that look/are <br/>\nlike them do it so I might as well avoid them&quot;. That social kind of <br/>\nresentment says blacks drop property values or Chinese are good at <br/>\nmath or, better yet, people of so-and-so race always beg for money. <br/>\nThat I find is more pervasive than bigotry. With outright bigotry you <br/>\nknow what&#39;s coming. Social resentment, that is the most vampiric, <br/>\nenergy sucking activity that bashes people down, takes away hope and <br/>\ncan only end up in alienation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no, this is not about doing the busy doing of anything. This is <br/>\nabout waking up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 11/20/02 8:12:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That child knows you treat her differently for what she is.

That happened in New <br/>\nMexico too.  When we had foster kids (one black, one hispanic, Mark and <br/>\nme), I went looking for a house to rent.  I found a nice one near UNM, <br/>\nand put a deposit on it.  We met the owner 3 hours later to sign the <br/>\npapers, but this time Mark and the kids came with me.  It was pretty <br/>\nobvious by the look on his face he was shocked, but I was shocked when <br/>\nhe returned my check to me and said that he had rented the place to <br/>\nsomeone who paid him 6 months rent in cash as well as the deposit and he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pass it up.

The old ladies who just LOVE my <br/>\nkids, think they are so beautiful, and rave about them--they are trying <br/>\nto prove to themselves that they are not racist but I see right through <br/>\nthem.  Just as Mark saw right through the high school counselor who <br/>\nsuggested he take shop or other vocational classes because he&#39;d never <br/>\nmake it to college anyway, and he needed a life skill.  Anyway,  the old <br/>\nprejudices are alive and well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSnipping some good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They hung out with me a while that morning and told me how bad it had <br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; when that woman who rolled her kids into the water in their carseats <br/>\n&gt; had lied<br/>\n&gt; and said  a black man had kidnapped them.  When I saw that story from my<br/>\n&gt; far-away perspective, at the time, that detail was small.  But to them <br/>\n&gt; it was<br/>\n&gt; big.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah it was.  Until you worry each night as your husband drives home <br/>\nfrom a gig that he might be pulled over for DWB, people don&#39;t understand <br/>\nhow big that was.  How many black men were questioned until she came <br/>\nforward and admitted she had murdered her own children?  A lot.  I <br/>\nremember this and remember talking to Mark about it and saying I thought <br/>\nshe had done it, before she admitted it.  The black man excuse, it&#39;s <br/>\nused all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joylyn,  this is a cultural scenario:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you were with your girls at the New Mexico State Fair, and it was <br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; dark, would you more likely shy away from a batch of teens from the <br/>\n&gt; Academy,<br/>\n&gt; or from the same number and gender of teens if the girls had mall hair <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; the guys all had hairnets and Our Lady of Guadalupe t-shirts?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, actually, probably the academy kids.  I&#39;ve had experience with <br/>\nthose brats and don&#39;t wish to have anythign to do with them.  There is <br/>\nalso that god awful christain school down by the freeway that used to <br/>\ncall the kids from our private school dropouts (how can kids going to a <br/>\nprivate school be dropouts?) and would foul them at every opportunity <br/>\nwhen we played sports against them.  And as I taught in the valley and <br/>\nas my brother looks more like the latter group than the former, and as I <br/>\nlove the state fair, I probably would not shy away from either group but <br/>\nwould continue doing what I wished.  My brother does security at the <br/>\nfair so I may have a different view point of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Mark and Ihave also discussed this.  he will be driving down <br/>\nthe freeway, 70 mph, and some white lady will look over and see him and <br/>\nlock her doors.  Like he&#39;s going to jump out of his moving car and get <br/>\nher, please.  It is not reasonable behavior.  However, if I am alone in <br/>\nan elevator, or waiting for one, and I see a man about to get on with <br/>\nme, I think about it.  The color is not important, however, what my <br/>\ntummy (as lexie says) indicates is important.  I have gotten off the <br/>\nelevator and waited for the next one because my tummy said I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsafe.  But I know that looks don&#39;t say a thing.  My brother looks <br/>\nscarey.  If you saw him at the fair, you would probably walk the other <br/>\nway.  He&#39;s big, very dark, long hair, and has an attitude, especially <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s working security or just hanging around.  But he&#39;s a big baby. <br/>\n However, he gets followed in stores, always has.  We used to play a <br/>\ngame with th is.  He would go into a store and then be followed and I <br/>\nwould then follow the employee that was following him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to answer your question, I think I would think about where I was.  I <br/>\ndont&#39; go on the midway at night without my brother or my husband.  I <br/>\nstick to the daytime, but then, I haven&#39;t been to the fair in years--I <br/>\nneed to go to NM next year in early september, I miss the NM state fair. <br/>\n I think it&#39;s less about color or hairnets, etc. as it is about taking <br/>\nbasic precautions, listening to my insticts, and looking at more than <br/>\nthe cover of a person and stereotypes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Jesse Jackson said once he was appalled that when he was walking <br/>\n&gt; around in<br/>\n&gt; Washington he was afraid to be followed by a black man.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but was he afraid of the black man or of the man?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 18 I dated a man.  He was funny, cute, tall, had a great <br/>\nsmile, treated me so nice.  But when we kissed, there was nothign there. <br/>\n I remember having a discussion with my mom.  Was I racist?  I mean, <br/>\nthis was the first black man I had dated, is that why I felt nothing. <br/>\n My mom reminded me that perhaps the color had nothing to do with it.  I <br/>\nhad dated white, hispanic, etc. men before and felt nothing and just <br/>\nmoved on.  Wasn&#39;t that the point of dating? to see what kind of man I <br/>\nliked?  And I realized, I did like this person, but there wasn&#39;t any <br/>\nthing more to it, he was just a good friend.  It had nothing to do with <br/>\ncolor, it was just that we didn&#39;t click.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How far does colorblindness go? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dont&#39; like color blindness.  I have always said that the world should <br/>\nnot be color blind, nor should it be focussed on color--it should just <br/>\nbe colorful.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does one leave the house open to prove<br/>\n&gt; trust?  Leave the car unlocked?  Equally in all neighborhoods and <br/>\n&gt; situations?<br/>\n&gt;   Is it racist for me to worry about Marty and his friend being downtown<br/>\n&gt; after a concert tomorrow night without any adults with them until <br/>\n&gt; Keith shows<br/>\n&gt; up?  Or is it just sensible fear of the area around the Sunshine <br/>\n&gt; Theatre at<br/>\n&gt; ANY time of day or night?  It&#39;s not a question of race or ethnicity.   A<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled teen came through and asked me to leave her at the train <br/>\n&gt; station<br/>\n&gt; one night at 3:00 a.m. or so.  NO WAY, I said.  For one thing, the train<br/>\n&gt; station doesn&#39;t even have a waiting room.  Turns out it was a bus ride <br/>\n&gt; to El<br/>\n&gt; Paso or some such to catch a train.  I wasn&#39;t leaving her at the bus <br/>\n&gt; station<br/>\n&gt; either.  We walked her in.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course you did.  It is silly to not take precautions in what could be <br/>\ndangerous situations.  I tell my girls, and my girlscouts, that if they <br/>\nget lost they should first look for an employee and second look for a <br/>\nperson in uniform (police, fire, etc.) and if they can&#39;t find either of <br/>\nthose, to go to a mother with children.  Not a dad with children, not a <br/>\nsingle woman, not an old grandma type, but a mom with children. <br/>\n Statistically that is the safest way to get help.  But I also say trust <br/>\nwhat your tummy says.  If you walk up to the employee and your tummy is <br/>\nsaying get away, then get away and find someone else.  Is that sexist to <br/>\nsay find a woman with children?  Probably, but it&#39;s also safest.  Mark <br/>\nhas said he is not offended when he is on a dark street and a woman <br/>\nspeeds up or crosses the street.  It is what he would expect me to do. <br/>\n it is what I would do.  But it&#39;s not about being black or white, it&#39;s <br/>\nabout being safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My half brother is as anglo as they come.

I have asked what race she is and <br/>\nwhat race the child in question is.  Only she can decide if there is <br/>\nsomething more.  I did not bring up race, she did.  But race, and <br/>\nracism, is a part of our world.  To deny that is stupid, and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhelp change come about.

She does.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s the recommendation?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had this three days ago from someone who grew up with me in Espanola, who <br/>\nmarried someone from South Carolina, who has lived in Virginia for over 20 <br/>\nyears, whose husband is a curator at the Smithsonian:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI can imagine how those old prejudices play into the lives of African <br/>\nAmericans, especially in the South.  There are such stigmas to overcome.  <br/>\nWell, I guess I&#39;ll take back the &quot;especially in the South&quot; part of it, <br/>\nbecause I know it could happen that way here, too, and probably further <br/>\nnorth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when I was at the National Gallery of Art with David, we were having a <br/>\nsnack at the cafeteria, and a black man came and sat down at the adjacent <br/>\ntable.  He didn&#39;t have any food, which was suspicious.  Anyway, he bent down <br/>\nto tie his shoe (or so it seemed), and I thought, &quot;that guy could be stealing <br/>\nmy purse&quot; but dismissed it right away, judging myself to be prejudiced. He <br/>\nlooked right at me, too, and sort of smiled.  Anyway, he then got up and <br/>\nleft, and I quickly looked down and checked to make sure my purse was still <br/>\non the floor where I had put it, and it was, so I kept talking to David.  I <br/>\nthen decided to get up to buy an apple, and grabbed my purse, picked out an <br/>\napple, went to pay for it--and guess what?  that guy HAD stolen my wallet!  <br/>\nSo ever since then, I just try to be more careful.   Also, I don&#39;t carry a <br/>\npurse that someone can just slide his/her hand in and grab a wallet oupected <br/>\n(I guess they are innocent until proven guilty) snipers ended up being black, <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\nYmelda<br/>\n<br/>\n In a message dated 11/17/2002 5:55:44 PM Eastern Standard Time, SandraDodd <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Two of the nurses (or a nurse and a tech) were in my room one morning <br/>\nwatching the sniper news on my TV, and when I told them they had had <br/>\nwitnesses and a description, and I said &quot;A white guy in a blue sweater&quot; they <br/>\nboth seemed really relieved that it wasn&#39;t a black guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut  here nobody would&#39;ve cared one way or another if there was a sniper if <br/>\nhe was black or anglo or hispanic or whatever.

I met my first<br/>\n&gt; Jewish person when I came to finish college at NYU --I was 19 years<br/>\n&gt; old. The person in question was my roommate. Talk about clash of<br/>\n&gt; cultures. She was an upper middle class &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; Orthodox Jew from<br/>\n&gt; Philapdelphia, I was a working class PRican black Catholic from the<br/>\n&gt; island. I learned a lot from her (gosh, can&#39;t remember her name right<br/>\n&gt; now) but it took me years to get that what was a common moniker used<br/>\n&gt; in my family is probably one of the most racist things that you could<br/>\n&gt; say. Yep, my parents were racists (especially my father) and,<br/>\n&gt; ironically, they worked actively in the Civil Rights Movement. And<br/>\n&gt; that makes me a recovering-racist as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which has taught me a great lesson.

His parents are like the most<br/>\n&gt; laid back Irish Catholics you&#39;ll ever meet; supporters of the<br/>\n&gt; unionized labor and CRM movements. I am sure they never thought<br/>\n&gt; anything about where they lived in the terms that most &quot;ethnics&quot;<br/>\n&gt; would look at it now.

Believe <br/>\nme, she knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have wanted to do the right thing but your main concern is <br/>\nfor the integrity of the group. Your main concern is to keep the <br/>\npeace. Most certainly your main concern is to show her who&#39;s boss. <br/>\nThat is what leaders do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have so many stories of people trying to do right because I was the <br/>\n&quot;other race&quot; or the &quot;other culture&quot;. And this has come from people of <br/>\nboth sides of the fence because I was either too dark or too <br/>\nlight-skinned or I spoke English too well or because I just spoke <br/>\nSpanish too well. The list goes on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, the do-gooding never felt sincere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing right now for you to do because you won. The family <br/>\nof that child has already made sure that she says the right things <br/>\nand does the right things so that she can fit in BECAUSE she is the <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust take this to heart ----Is her race or her culture that <br/>\nimportant? What race or culture has ingrained in its idiosyncrasy <br/>\nthat, yes, it is OK to ask money from strangers?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me leave with a little story:  In Spanish, if you want to use <br/>\nhyperbole to describe someone&#39;s skill with money you can say, <br/>\n&quot;Ese/Esa es un/a judía&quot;; or &quot;That one is a Jew&quot;.  I met my first <br/>\nJewish person when I came to finish college at NYU --I was 19 years <br/>\nold. The person in question was my roommate. Talk about clash of <br/>\ncultures. She was an upper middle class &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; Orthodox Jew from <br/>\nPhilapdelphia, I was a working class PRican black Catholic from the <br/>\nisland. I learned a lot from her (gosh, can&#39;t remember her name right <br/>\nnow) but it took me years to get that what was a common moniker used <br/>\nin my family is probably one of the most racist things that you could <br/>\nsay. Yep, my parents were racists (especially my father) and, <br/>\nironically, they worked actively in the Civil Rights Movement. And <br/>\nthat makes me a recovering-racist as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich has taught me a great lesson.  People do not understand how <br/>\nprejudice is so deeply ingrained in speech until someone else calls <br/>\nthem on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember the day my husband (who is &quot;white&quot;) was talking about the <br/>\n&quot;old&quot; Springfield; about how there was only one black kid in the <br/>\nlocal high school, how when he was little the darkest people were <br/>\nItalians and anybody Jewish lived at the other side of Main Street. <br/>\nSo I turned in disbelief and asked him, &quot;There were segregated towns <br/>\nin NJ during the 60&#39;s?&quot; He choked on a laugh because it was the first <br/>\ntime he reckoned with such a thought. His parents are like the most <br/>\nlaid back Irish Catholics you&#39;ll ever meet; supporters of the <br/>\nunionized labor and CRM movements. I am sure they never thought <br/>\nanything about where they lived in the terms that most &quot;ethnics&quot; <br/>\nwould look at it now. This is because they were the ethnics once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes years to work on these foibles. The first step is acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] STICKY FINGERS","postDate":"1037846610","msgId":10841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwLjJmZTk1M2UzLjJiMGRhMjUyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10839,"nextInTopic":10843,"prevInTime":10840,"nextInTime":10842,"topicId":10812,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/02 6:33:53 PM Central Standard Time, ...

I could go out and look in <br/>\nthe archives and get your exact quotes, but it seems to me that you <br/>\nbrought up race.  You brought up cultural differences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion of this is simple. I think you don&#39;t like this child.  That&#39;s <br/>\nOK, not everyone can like every child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll kids steal.  They do so for different reasons.  A couple of weeks <br/>\nago my 4 year old said off handedly that when she needed extra quarters <br/>\nshe woudl go into the quarter collection in the girl scout stuff.  I <br/>\nthought she was kidding until I looked and realized that there was money <br/>\nmissing.  Is it because she is black?  No, it&#39;s because she&#39;s 4 and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand things.  My 7 year old was taking the cash that I&#39;d <br/>\ntake out of my jeans and putting it in her banks.  I saw her one time <br/>\nand asked her to please let me know or ask me before, because I might <br/>\nhave needed that money for something.  No big deal.  We share in this <br/>\nfamily and she assumed, for good reason, that we share money too.  We do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a former teacher I had a few kids steal from me.  I just gave them <br/>\nmore, more love, more attention.  I kept food in my classroom as many of <br/>\nthem were hungry.  And sometimes I gave them money so they could buy <br/>\nfrom the bake sell or whatever.  It was im portant to them, for many <br/>\ndifferent reasons.  But these reasons had more to do with their home <br/>\nlife and little to do with their race or culture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nhow do you know the girl didn&#39;t get  the quarter from a family member. <br/>\n A few weeks ago at our booth sale, one of the girls ran up to a strange <br/>\nwoman and the woman gave her some money, then walked away. I quickly <br/>\ncaught up to the woman and asked what was going on.  Ends up she was the <br/>\nchild&#39;s aunt.  We sell in our neighborhood so the girls often know the <br/>\npeople who are shopping, they are family members or neighbors.  We have <br/>\nan elderly neighbor who always gives the girls money, candy, little toys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I am rambling.  You asked our opinion on this issue and <br/>\nthen you are mad because you don&#39;t like what we are saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still would ike to know the race of the child and your own race.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nAsian folks drive crazy. I know this because I live in a city that is <br/>\nmostly asian and they all drive crazy.  They drive slow or fast, don&#39;t <br/>\nsignal, and it&#39;s because of where they come from.  It&#39;s part of their <br/>\nculture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBlack people steal.  So do hispanics.  It&#39;s part of their culture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese comments are rude and stereotyping and not acceptable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tuckervill@...\">Tuckervill@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In a message dated 11/20/2002 5:55:11 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katguts@...\">katguts@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she added that the girl was a different race and maybe it was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cultural thing.

This was no interrogation under a spot light.  <br/>\nWe had a conversation with her, in which she eventually saw that she was <br/>\ntrapped and she admitted it.  Besides, her cousin saw her take the dollar, <br/>\naccused her of it right on the spot, and she denied it.  I, too, once <br/>\nadmitted to doing something I didn&#39;t do just to get out of a bad situation.  <br/>\nThis is not what happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You also say she asked someone for money and this bothers you.  But again <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t &#39;see&#39; it yourself.  You mentioned that sometimes people were <br/>\noffering the girls money.  Is it possible someone just gave it to her?  You <br/>\nsay there is a witness.  Is it possible they misunderstood the situation?  Or <br/>\nmaybe someone gave another child money and this girl saw and asked for one as <br/>\nwell.  Not exactly proper, it&#39;s true.  But not a crime either.  And certainly <br/>\nbetter than stealing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read what I wrote?

I don&#39;t let my feelings dictate my <br/>\nactions.  I do, however, allow my actions to be informed by my experiences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned her race because it is my experience that the small children who <br/>\nasked me for money on the street, and the pre-teens who have asked me for the <br/>\nlast piece of pizza on my table at Chuck E. Cheese have all been of this <br/>\ngirl&#39;s race.  I feel these actions are evidence of a cultural difference <br/>\nbetween my race and theirs, and I am willing to accept that, and I fully <br/>\nrealize I don&#39;t have to participate in those transactions.  But I can&#39;t have <br/>\nthose transactions happen in the context of our fundraiser.  Ideally, the <br/>\nchildren would be on board with the fact that the money they are offered <br/>\nshould be part of a donation to the club, and not for their own pockets.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t care what they do on their own time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So you&#39;re getting some of her share of my frustration becase I don&#39;t know <br/>\nyou and I can&#39;t tell her what a horrible pig she is.  So I am sorry if this <br/>\nwas more than needed to be said :)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, some of these folks have met me.

I have to say it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said in your most recent post that this girl would have to prove herself to you in order for you to trust her again.  What do you mean by that exactly?  How can she prove herself if not by coming to sekll candy and NOT stealing?  Didn&#39;t she do that?  You said yourself she didn&#39;t steal the second time.  What more proof do you need?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want you to take this too personally but in some ways it sounds like you&#39;re looking for bad in this girl.  The way you quickly assumed that she stole the money the second time with *absolutely no evidence* to back up the assumption hints at this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is you don&#39;t really have any proof that she stole the &#39;first&#39; dollar.  You say that she eventually confessed to it in front of you and her grandmother but if she denied it to begin with and if you continued to press the issue after her denial she may have seen a false confession as the quickest way out of a very uncomfortable situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 9 or so I had a close friend who was stealing things from a school stockroom.  When her mom found her stash she confronted her and she told her that I had stolen it.  I didn&#39;t even know anything about it so when my parents confronted me with what they *knew* I had done, boy was I surprised.  But no matter how much I denied it they were sure I had done it and were ready to punish me for it *and* for lying about it.  So I apologized for stealing the stuff and promised never to do it again.  And I haven&#39;t.  :)  Maybe Sandra is right about the Marines.  Maybe I&#39;ve known too many adults who jump to conclusions so I don&#39;t trust them as a group now.  Maybe that&#39;s why this whole story is sitting so wrong with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr lets say she did take the dollar.  maybe she did.  And then she saw that she didn&#39;t get away with it.  Wised up and decided not to do it again.  Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also say she asked someone for money and this bothers you.  But again you didn&#39;t &#39;see&#39; it yourself.  You mentioned that sometimes people were offering the girls money.  Is it possible someone just gave it to her?  You say there is a witness.  Is it possible they misunderstood the situation?  Or maybe someone gave another child money and this girl saw and asked for one as well.  Not exactly proper, it&#39;s true.  But not a crime either.  And certainly better than stealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe all that would be needed was to have a little group meeting about what&#39;s expected during candy sales to make them &#39;proffesional&#39;.  Make a rule and let it be known that the girls are not allowed to accept &#39;tips&#39;.  And if people want to give them money they should tell them they can&#39;t accept it but that if the would like to go ahead and make a donation they certainly can.

You&#39;re getting an unfair share of my frustration with adults in leadership positions who don&#39;t respect the kids they are dealing with.  I&#39;m sure you respect them very much.  But My MIL who teaches 6th grade was just telling me how DUMB particular kids in her class are.  So you&#39;re getting some of her share of my frustration becase I don&#39;t know you and I can&#39;t tell her what a horrible pig she is.
