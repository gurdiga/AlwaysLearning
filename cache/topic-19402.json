I think I understand what you&#39;re saying about my <br/>\nrequest for only helpful suggestions (Ren), but again I can&#39;t help but <br/>\nfeel that my request was misunderstood, not by everyone but by those <br/>\nwho found it to be so extremely offensive. In no way did I mean that <br/>\nadvice freely given was unwanted, I meant, and have tried to explain <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t want mean spirited e-mails. All of the actual advice I <br/>\nhave gotten from everyone has been greatly appreciated, the mean crap <br/>\nhas been just that; mean crap. Having reread your first reply to me, I <br/>\nmust say that it really wasn&#39;t the thing that made me feel that badly. <br/>\nYour e-mail was actually maternal, it was just the idea that my plea <br/>\nfor helpful suggestions could offend to the degree that it did, <br/>\nespecially when there are some pretty offensive things being written by <br/>\nsome of the folks on this site, and my little old sentence sets off <br/>\nthis kind of reaction. I wonder if I had worded the plea differently <br/>\n(&quot;please, I&#39;m vulnerable, so if you can&#39;t give advice without first <br/>\nbeing mean, just give me fair warning in the e-mail&#39;s subjsct so that I <br/>\ncan delete your message and not get my feelings hurt...&quot;). I still <br/>\ndon&#39;t see the correlation between maturity and setting boundaries, we <br/>\nall need to set boundaries, it&#39;s part of adulthood. And it needs to be <br/>\npointed out here, that you were offended by a request, that was not <br/>\npersonally directed at you(it was a general request), yet, it seems <br/>\nokay to tell someone directly that she is extremely offensive and <br/>\nimmature, for making that simple request. And that request carried <br/>\nnothing with it, I didn&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t want useless drivel.&quot; It really <br/>\nwas only about not wanting *unnecessary* mean stuff. No where on this <br/>\nmessage board does it say &quot;If you post a request, brace yourself for <br/>\nsome serious harshing out&quot;, so I&#39;m not really getting that whole <br/>\nvegetarian thing. I  know none of us will ever have to see one another <br/>\nface to face and in that there is a security, one in which we can say <br/>\n*anything* we want to each other, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we have to <br/>\nbe mean to each other. Someone said something to me today about being <br/>\ntoo honest, about  letting people know too much about me or my <br/>\nvulnerability...The same can be said about being too honest in a mean <br/>\nor unnecessarily harsh way. I know I&#39;m not immature nor am I  extremely <br/>\noffensive. I&#39;m a sensitive, loving person who tries to come from the <br/>\nheart and not strictly from the mind, because when I disconnect from my <br/>\nheart, I get bitchy and start hurting people&#39;s feelings. Kay Alina, you <br/>\nare an angel for writing what you did and for choosing to not take <br/>\npersonally my generalized plea for &quot;no meanies, please&quot; . Your words <br/>\nencouraged and comforted me, and yet you are a total stranger, thank <br/>\nyou, thank you, thank you.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 23, 2004, at 3:43 PM, Ren wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Please try to<br/>\n&gt;  keep in mind that when someone asks a bunch of strangers for help, <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;  most likely� she (or he) is really desperate and struggling&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  But we already know that.<br/>\n&gt;  Many of us here, answer questions on lists and message boards, and <br/>\n&gt; even in person every week.
