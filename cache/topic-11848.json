So strange to be reading this today because I had a similar train of<br/>\nthought yesterday--I was cleaning house and had certain things I wanted done<br/>\nbefore people came over. There wasn&#39;t time to do it all, and I had a little<br/>\nconversation<br/>\ngoing in my head where someone was being critical (faceless someone,<br/>\ncertainly wasn&#39;t anyone who was coming over) and I was thinking, &quot;Don&#39;t look<br/>\nat what I *haven&#39;t* done--look at all I *have* done!&quot; I was talking to<br/>\nmyself, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it struck me to ponder how often I might&#39;ve done that to my<br/>\nkids--looked more at what they hadn&#39;t done than what they had. Or times I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone it to my husband, or my parents, or anyone. It&#39;s a good thing to be<br/>\nthinking about,<br/>\nso that I can be thankful, interested, and appreciative, not critical.<br/>\nLissa, mom of 5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL - I&#39;m feeling like that right now.  The kids&#39; bedrooms are a mess, no<br/>\ndinner is made yet.  I need to get ready for work tomorrow and get two of<br/>\nthe kids ready for school.  It&#39;s already 5:51 pm...and my mind is going and<br/>\ngoing.

I decided to post my response here incase anyone <br/>\nelse had the same issues.<br/>\nSam died 5 years ago, Jan. 19, 2003 when he fell through the ice on a <br/>\npond at our rec. dept.  He was there with friends of ours for their <br/>\ndaughters indoor lacrosse game.  Their son and Sam went outside and <br/>\nonto the pond.  Their son fell through too, but managed to hang on <br/>\ntil the rescue workers arrived.  Sam was lost instantly.  <br/>\nMy advice to you, is to let go of your fear.  It will do you <br/>\nabsolutely no good.  <br/>\nIt will waste the time you have with your son that could be spent in <br/>\ntrust and joy.  <br/>\nBreath through it when the fear comes.  Let it go.  <br/>\nI had fear before Sam died which intensified for my other kids after <br/>\nhe died, and I have spent a lot of time breathing through it.  I will <br/>\nnot let my fear affect my kids life.  I will not let it limit their <br/>\npossibilities.  I&#39;ve had to watch my kids go off with other people, <br/>\nwith the memory of Sam leaving our house that day to go play with his <br/>\nfriend.  As they walked off our porch, Sam, who was really excited <br/>\nabout playing Animal Crossing with his buddy said to him, &quot;this is <br/>\ngoing to be the best day of our life!&quot;  <br/>\nEvery time I watch one of my other kids leave with someone other than <br/>\nme, I have that memory.  It helps me to really be grateful for the <br/>\ntime I have and to try to not waste it.  <br/>\nMy oldest has been to Europe and Florida without us.  She is driving <br/>\nnow and comes and goes quite a bit with work and school.  She&#39;s <br/>\nheading off to college in the fall.  Deep breaths and a knowing that <br/>\nI really cant control her destiny keeps me sane.  I try not to let <br/>\nthe fear take me deeper.<br/>\nIf I can do it.  You can do it.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Fear","postDate":"1043437396","msgId":11848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZS4zMjgyYzQuMmI2MmYxNTRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33852,"prevInTime":11847,"nextInTime":11849,"topicId":11848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi again, when the kids were younger it was a struggle to have that leap of faith - since we were in the military community, our style was exceptionally","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1566292410\">Hi again,<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen the kids were younger it was a struggle to have that &quot;leap of faith&quot; - <br/>\nsince we were in the military community, our style was exceptionally strange. <br/>\n And children learning at home was not a usual way of life - often unheard <br/>\nof.  But I knew in my heart that how I felt with them at home vs when they <br/>\nwere in school (Chris went thro 4th grade, and Shawn K) that it was right.  I <br/>\nfound kindred spirits in LaLeche League.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Shawn started community college here (he discovered it was cheaper to <br/>\nbecome a full-time student and have extended health insurance, then buy the <br/>\nins.), he struggled with taking notes, and studying.  BUT, he used to call me <br/>\nand tell me the whole class of things like mythology.  He was so jazzed about <br/>\nwhat he was learning.  He even took me to school with him one day to share <br/>\nthe experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow he is in PA and on a diving scholarship.  He feels such a sense of <br/>\nresponsibility to his coach and the school.  He manages good grades even tho <br/>\nhe works as a bartender, works out tons and has a girlfriend.  He is majoring <br/>\nin acting, and gets quite annoyed at the others in group projects that aren&#39;t <br/>\ncommitted and serious about the whole thing.  Most of the students are <br/>\nregular college age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t doubt that I would still think my kids were pretty terrific if they <br/>\nhad gone to school (like some of my friends&#39; and relatives&#39; kids), but I can <br/>\nsee an inner committment, drive, and a personal responsibility that I think <br/>\nhelps them focus on what they want, and gets them there.  Watching them gives <br/>\nme a high.  Not to say that there aren&#39;t times when life comes crashing in, <br/>\nand I have a heartache for some of the choices they make while they continue <br/>\non their journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn said recently, homeschooling is one way, but doesn&#39;t have to be THE <br/>\nway!  I sure think it was the BEST way for him, he was so into the peer <br/>\npressure, getting it only out of school hours was plenty :-).  He asked me <br/>\nwhen he was 12 why I didn&#39;t get a job, so I wouldn&#39;t be there ALL the time.  <br/>\nHE was why I need to be there all the time at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on endlessly, but for now I simply wish to re-assure those of you <br/>\nthat are behind me on this path, that your children benefit SO much by the <br/>\nchoice you have made in keeping them at home.  It shows thro in so many ways <br/>\nas they grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nbye for now,<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see it the potential success with my kids, but it&#39;s little, because <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; still home.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really liked reading where your kids are at the moment, and that the <br/>\n&gt; diver <br/>\n&gt; has A&#39;s too.  <br/>\n&gt; Not that &quot;A&#39;s&quot; are a goal, but it might be making him feel societally right <br/>\n&gt; and good and legit, if he ever did have those doubts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33878,"nextTopicId":33958}}
