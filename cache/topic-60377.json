I&#39;m going to pick through that, and because you posted it on a list I own, you&#39;re going to let me do that without saying it&#39;s ridiculous, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n1) do not<br/>\n2) irresponsible<br/>\n3) unattended<br/>\n4) not a good thing<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all in one sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say That making sure he is attended would be a good thing.

Whether you agree with her, feel she is being argumentative, feel she is hopeless, or otherwise, telling her what you will have her do in any context is outright disrespect.  As the owner of this list, you are not the controller. <br/>\n_____________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is it I am not the controller of the list, first of all?  I created it.  I have the ability to block posts, remove members, and delete the entire list if I get tired of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t control what people post, but I do request that people read about the list before posting, and cooperate with the purpose and intent of the list, partly for the benefit of casual readers, and partly out of regard for the huge amount of time the regular posters and the several moderators put into reading all the posts and responding thoughtfully from their years of experience with unschooling.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t address (again) having been told something I had written was &quot;ridiculous.&quot;  I only mentioned it in passing, as quoted above.  I have in the past objected strongly to the word &quot;ridiculous,&quot; when aimed toward someone or something someone wrote on this list.  It&#39;s WAY too strong a word to use about other people&#39;s freely offered advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brought it up because of this statement (which was probably in the 80% my critic didn&#39;t read):  &quot; I have gotten some great advice and believe me I do not love my animals more then my children...how ridiculous really! &quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/60355\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/60355</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/negativity\">http://sandradodd.com/negativity</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/priorities\">http://sandradodd.com/priorities</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/ridiculous\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/ridiculous</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile looking for my past objections of &quot;ridiculous&quot; to create the third link above, I found this, which seems to apply to the topic that got so many people riled up (though maybe &quot;understanding the situation&quot; instead of unschooling, in this new case).  It&#39;s from a whole different discussion, in 2007.<br/>\n______________________<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can read more than you write, and if you can REALLY read and<br/>\ntry to apply the suggestions instead of batting them away, you will<br/>\nmove quickly toward the possibility of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is trying to thwart you.
