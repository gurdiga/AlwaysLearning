So you think... I could hit him or I could just yell.   And  <br/>\nwhen you just yell,  you&#39;re a step closer to where you want to be.   <br/>\nSo the next time, improve your two choices.  I could yell, or I could  <br/>\njust take a deep breath and say what I&#39;m angry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nHitting wasn&#39;t even one of the choices anymore, so you&#39;re moving  <br/>\nincrementally toward REALLY good choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time... I could say what I&#39;m angry about, or I could try to find  <br/>\nout why HE is doing what he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon your two choices aren&#39;t even about you, they&#39;re about making  <br/>\nother people more comfortable and making peace.  And once you  <br/>\nexperience how productive, warm, and relationship-strengthening that  <br/>\nis, yelling or complaining about YOUR feelings wouldn&#39;t be anywhere  <br/>\nnear your two choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo whereas at one time &quot;just&quot; saying &quot;that makes me angry because...&quot;  <br/>\nseems like progress, you might get to the point that the melt-down  <br/>\nsituations haven&#39;t even happened, because in making choices in OTHER  <br/>\nareas (and all the time) your kids aren&#39;t as hungry and tired as they  <br/>\nused to be, their needs were attended to before there was something  <br/>\nto hit or yell about, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Spilled milk","postDate":"1137346362","msgId":24098,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGRxY3VybCtvZWV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24093,"nextInTopic":24102,"prevInTime":24097,"nextInTime":24099,"topicId":24074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-794032654\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We recently rented the mind-blowing DVD &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know?!&quot; <br/>\nand there is a part of that movie that talks about connections in your <br/>\nbrain.
