In fact, he&#39;s actually completely re-oriented his awake schedule from 12:00pm - 2:00am to 7:00am - 10:00pm - all by himself. These were a lot of changes for him - but because he identified a passion that he wanted to pursue, he figured out what he needed to do and got it done. He never saw the changes as hurdles or obstacles, so they seemed like no big deal to him - just part of what he needed to do to pursue his passions. It&#39;s amazing!  <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal Miller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willowsfortress@...\">willowsfortress@...</a>&gt; wrote:          &lt;&lt;A competent unschooled kid that truly wants something won&#39;t see it as some <br/>\noverwhelming hurdle, but just one thing to figure out on the journey.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorscha decided to take a &#39;K9 & Kid Camp&#39; where she brings her dog & learns <br/>\nhow to coach him on the dog agility course.
