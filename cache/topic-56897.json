His biggest passion right now is football. and watching him pore over video clips and articles/books, and the way he is at practice, it&#39;s very much in an &quot;I want to be the best I can be&quot; kind of attitude vs &quot;I am so much better than&quot;.  He speaks with much excitement about the fast kids (which he is), the guys who can catch *any* pass (which he can&#39;t), and with equal admiration about the two very large and out-of-shape guys who just keep on and never give up (even after one of them threw up on the field after running on the 2nd day of practice).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has definitely become important to him as he has reached his teen years.

The biggest clue is the one above!  Science and math don&#39;t need to be <br/>\nsubjects.  They exist all around us, they help define the world and how it <br/>\nworks.  I recently watched a documentary called Between The Folds.  I watched it <br/>\non Netflix.

It&#39;s done with something as <br/>\nsimple as folding paper.  People used to see the interconnectedness of these <br/>\nthings.  Somehow it got lost in our modern educational system where everything <br/>\nis separate from everything else and all of it is separated from the world and <br/>\nany kind of real world practical application.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling will help you find the joy in science and math.  Once you can see it <br/>\noutside of school context, it becomes alive and fascinating and huge and <br/>\nbeautiful.  All those things that you did in school, once taken out of that <br/>\nenvironment can be things of wonder again.  Science and math never needed to be <br/>\nsubjects to be disliked, it&#39;s one of the biggest most harmful things that <br/>\nschools do to children, it takes these wonderful things in our world and makes <br/>\nthem dry and boring and meaningless, like passing on fake diamonds and calling <br/>\nthem brilliant when they aren&#39;t.  A child may never know just how beautiful a <br/>\ndiamond can be and they may never seek it out because they&#39;ve grown accustomed <br/>\nto the fake and not very sparkly thing that&#39;s been passed as one. <br/>\n The florescent light passing through the fake diamond may never thrill a child, <br/>\nand worse, it may bore that child and cause them to find diamonds boring.  Take <br/>\na real diamond into the sun, that&#39;s the real world, brilliant and beautiful. <br/>\n That&#39;s what deschooling can do for you, and it&#39;s what you can give to your <br/>\nchildren as a gift!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Can reading and writing be unlearned?","postDate":"1282498739","msgId":56929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk0cm5iais1NXJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzRkEwMjUwLTRCN0YtNEVBNi1BQjI3LTRBQTdGQTA2RkUwRkBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":56928,"nextInTopic":56930,"prevInTime":56928,"nextInTime":56930,"topicId":56897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

All I have to offer is this: The first fall that we did not return to school, my daughter also stopped &quot;reading&quot;...preferring instead to spend almost all her time in the land of imagination.  She was 8...and almost never &quot;Hayley&quot; anymore (the name she had been given at birth:)  She renamed herself a million different times...she and her sister were &quot;pioneer girls&quot; for hours at a time...I watched in awe (and yes, sometimes in fear...for the same reasons that you express)...but I realized (with the help of my new acquaintances) that my girls were playing &quot;catch-up&quot;...they had spent almost all of their childhood up to that point doing &quot;have-to&quot; things...there hadn&#39;t been time to just be what kids were naturally meant to be...free spirits, lovers of play and fun, imaginative beings of light.  <br/>\nMy girls eventualy picked up books again...when they were ready...they needed to first fill up their empty souls.  They are now voracious readers...sometimes the kind of reading that schools would deem important...sometimes not.  But the point is that it can happen, if you allow your kids to reclaim their childhoods first.  Hope this helps:)<br/>\nMuch love,<br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Katrine Clip &lt;katrine@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to ask about this, it has been bothering me, and especially my<br/>\n&gt; husband, since we took our now 9 year old twin boys out of school in<br/>\n&gt; November last year. They never learned to read well in school - and before<br/>\n&gt; we knew about unschooling, we took them to tutors and reading classes a lot.<br/>\n&gt; They seemed to be learning to read from the repetitive nature of the year<br/>\n&gt; long reading program.... and then we did a 360 and took them out of school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since then, we have not pushed reading or writing, but letting them do it<br/>\n&gt; naturally in games and whenever they wanted to pick up a book. They went<br/>\n&gt; from being budding readers and beginning writers to nothing. They don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; basic math anymore either. They will read comic books, they read their<br/>\n&gt; Pokemon cards, they read online prompts, but not books. They never write,<br/>\n&gt; and when I ask them to sign a birthday card, they can hardly remember how<br/>\n&gt; they spell their own names anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They will occasionally ask me how to spell words because they want to find a<br/>\n&gt; game or buy something on the internet, they know where the letters are on a<br/>\n&gt; keyboard. But even simple words they knew and used every day before, I need<br/>\n&gt; to help them spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have they unlearned to write?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When will they start learning it again? Will they? My husband has such a<br/>\n&gt; pessimistic view on this that it&#39;s getting to me too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I don&#39;t use French for a while, I feel a bit rusty when I start<br/>\n&gt; speaking it again. A friend of mine who went to school in France with me<br/>\n&gt; more than 20 years ago, has forgotten everything he learned that year. He<br/>\n&gt; has no French anymore because he didn&#39;t use it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And then there are the comparisons. Our oldest son read well at 6 or 7,<br/>\n&gt; devouring Harry Patter and other thick books by 8 and 9. How do I handle<br/>\n&gt; comparisons, it&#39;s so hard not to compare and then judge. And it&#39;s unfair on<br/>\n&gt; them, they always seem to be on the losing side being the youngest and the<br/>\n&gt; weakest. Big brother will always be 2 years older and stronger.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we want to watch a movie with them they first ask &quot;is it a learning<br/>\n&gt; movie?&quot; because if they think it is then they are not interested. They do<br/>\n&gt; not want to learn anything. They say they don&#39;t need to learn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (The twins do have differing personality traits, but are very similar in<br/>\n&gt; both looks and preferences and opinions. They are two different persons,<br/>\n&gt; with different interests, and at the same time so in tune with each other.<br/>\n&gt; So when I write &quot;they&quot; it may seem like I&#39;m lumping them together as one,<br/>\n&gt; but that&#39;s because they have those things in common.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have tried reading to them, it&#39;s boring (maybe my accent isn&#39;t right<br/>\n&gt; either). Audioboks are boring too. We talk about things as they happen and<br/>\n&gt; we make connections, and that works better, but their attention span is SO<br/>\n&gt; short. In the middle of a conversation, they will start talking about<br/>\n&gt; totally different things, like that fly on the ceiling. Or just walk away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Their imagination is vivid and wild when they play, but it&#39;s just hard work<br/>\n&gt; to read, and not enjoyable at all. They are stimulated by visual things,<br/>\n&gt; illustrations (one of them collects a book series with titles like<br/>\n&gt; Dragonology, Vampireology because they are beautifully illustrated - he<br/>\n&gt; enjoys looking at them), tv, video games, internet. But the written words in<br/>\n&gt; books don&#39;t fire up their imagination. My husband thinks that their interest<br/>\n&gt; in books has diminished after we started allowing tv alot more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband is so worried about their future, how will they learn anything if<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t read? How will they succeed? Success to him is tied in with a<br/>\n&gt; good education (college) and a good job.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our boys are growing up trilingual and are actively speaking all three<br/>\n&gt; languages although English is the language of choice and comfort. Can this<br/>\n&gt; have something to do with their seeming inability, or unwillingness, to read<br/>\n&gt; English? Our oldest son didn&#39;t have these issues, and now he can even read<br/>\n&gt; some French and Norwegian. Comparing again...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your insights,<br/>\n&gt; Katrine<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211875477,"authorName":"amylizkid1","from":"&quot;amylizkid1&quot; &lt;amylizkid1@...&gt;","profile":"amylizkid1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Can reading and writing be unlearned?","postDate":"1282328179","msgId":56918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk0bWdwais5OGk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk0bDN2NStzNWVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56916,"nextInTopic":56920,"prevInTime":56917,"nextInTime":56919,"topicId":56897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Emma,7, can read a few words and do some math.

From the time Andrew was itty bitty, my husband (who&#39;s not much of a book reader) or I read to Andrew some each day, and always at bedtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the first changes we made as we eased into unschooling (when Andrew was 5 or 6) was to let reading become an option. Andrew&#39;s reaction was to not want to be read to at all. Eep! That was hard for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I noticed is that he still loved to look through some &quot;find the Pokemon&quot; books we had. And we were playing Animal Crossing (video game) together and it has LOTS of reading in it -- I&#39;d read outloud while we played, and some days would start getting hoarse from reading so much! But as the months passed, he was comfortable playing the game on his own for longer and longer stretches of time and was coming to me less often asking for my help in reading something on-screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribed to Nintendo Power magazine (very family-friendly) and would read the articles to him; he&#39;d look through on his own and check out the screen caps. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs his reading skills progressed, his interest in books remained quite low. BUT, we began buying video game guides for his video games, and he had some Pokemon guides, and I&#39;d often find him looking through those various guides on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was reading, but reading things that interested HIM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, 2 or 3 years ago, we were at the bookstore and took a walk through the young-readers section and he spied a series of Boba Fett books and asked if we could buy one for him to try. He liked it, so we picked up the next couple books in the series, which he read and passed along to me to read (he often asks me to read series that interest him and I usually enjoy them too), then the series hit a point that the storylines didn&#39;t interest him. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, he&#39;s read 6 or 8 other book series; some were ones I came across at the library that looked interesting, others were recommended to him by friends. Right now we&#39;re both reading the Eragon series. I had suggested it to him several times in the past, but he didn&#39;t have an interest in it until one of his friends recommended it [g]. He reads a book then passes it to me; he&#39;s nearly done with the third book, and I&#39;m nearly done with the second.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he finishes a series, he&#39;s fine going for weeks or months without reading another novel. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not reading in the meantime -- he&#39;s reading plenty! Gaming magazines, game reviews, doing research on the internet, writing his own game reviews for his blog, reading his Facebook page and his friends&#39; pages, reading in-game narration in video games, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done such an about-face in how I view books, and in how I view other reading material as well. I no longer view one as being more or less valuable than another. If someone finds something interesting enough to read, *that* is what makes it valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost every night, my son and I chat quite a long time before I go to bed. It&#39;s not uncommon for him to use a word and I find myself thinking, &quot;Wow! Is that a word I knew at his age? I wonder where he heard or read it?&quot;. Not wondering in a bad way, rather wondering in an &quot;that&#39;s interesting&quot; way. Some of those words may have come from books he&#39;s read, but I would say that more of them came other than from books.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Can reading and writing be unlearned?","postDate":"1282282007","msgId":56915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2RkFDMzkzLUMwMDUtNDdCRi1BQjVCLTc2RDY1MUExQ0I5MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltTXdfTlIyd3dlTS0yb0p4UVJUUDRaUTBTPWc3V2g9K089U1NKckBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9T3N5UlNFRjVkQnNFRVBoellxTHNuNUo9ODFSclRzcXpNSGVOaEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDcyNTUzMUVDLTRBMzMtNDZFNS05ODc3LUQzNjYyQzgwMjUxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEFBTkxrVGltTXdfTlIyd3dlTS0yb0p4UVJUUDRaUTBTPWc3V2g9K089U1NKckBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56914,"nextInTopic":56916,"prevInTime":56914,"nextInTime":56916,"topicId":56897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I want to unschool and do it well, and I need my husband partnering with me in this.-=- You don t need to wait for him to get it to move in that direction.

If you didn&#39;t realize that, you should perhaps play with them.  You will see the math skills if you do.  SEE the learning in the things they are doing.===<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying Pokemon is how my son learned to count by, add, and subtract by 10&#39;s and 5&#39;s. I remember listening to him count by tens one day and when I asked him how he learned to do that, he said by playing Pokemon with his cousins! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe never played the card game according to the official rules, rather we made up our own rules, but it was pretty cool over the years to see how quick he became at adding and subtracting by 10&#39;s and 5&#39;s in his head as we played Pokemon (cards or action figures).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I enjoyed tremendously when Andrew was younger was asking him &quot;how did you get to that number?&quot; when we&#39;d be playing Pokemon or store or restaurant or something else in which he&#39;d add or subtract or multiply or divide (in his head, no less!). Without having formal instruction on how to do those things, it was fascinating to me how he&#39;d arrive at a correct answer!! (He would usually round to get a rough answer, then figure out the final answer from there.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI was always good at math in school, but I&#39;ve discovered I&#39;m only good at school-math (working math problems the way I was taught in school, using paper and pencil) -- I am *not* so good at rounding and getting to an answer the way Andrew does, nor at doing math in my head. He can often get to an answer in his head much quicker than I, regardless of whether I&#39;m trying to work the problem in my head or on paper. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m no idiot and he&#39;s no genius -- I would consider us both &quot;average&quot; when it comes to math. The difference, I think, is that he learned how to do math in a way that is comfortable and natural to him and, thus far (at age 12), he&#39;s been able to do more difficult math with no problem; I, on the other hand, can only do math well the way I learned it, which is a real disadvantage if I need to get an answer quickly and don&#39;t have paper and pencil in-hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple months ago, Andrew and I were playing around with a big calculator I&#39;d bought for a buck at Hobby Lobby. I showed him how to use the multiplication and division buttons and did a couple multiplication and division problems, explaining that &quot;when people say &#39;multiply&#39; or &#39;divide&#39;, this is what they mean&quot;. His reply: &quot;Ohhhhh&quot;, said in a &quot;well that&#39;s not such a big deal&quot; tone of voice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to Pokemon, video games that utilized numerical scores and some form of money also helped him hone his math skills. We played video games together starting when he was 3 and most of the games required the ability to add or subtract -- did he have enough money to buy this or that or to open a new level?, how much more money did he need to do those things?, etc. As he got older and played more complex video games, his math skills became more complex.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are open-minded about the fact that learning happens in ways that you might not have considered (in my son&#39;s case, Pokemon and video games), you&#39;ll see some cool stuff happen!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Can reading and writing be unlearned?","postDate":"1282278959","msgId":56913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlraTlnOVQxRE5xcVkrT1poYTJqRHZab2Y0WDIweE9FPTBBcFo2dEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0ODI0Mi44MjMxMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9T3N5UlNFRjVkQnNFRVBoellxTHNuNUo9ODFSclRzcXpNSGVOaEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDQ0ODI0Mi44MjMxMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56912,"nextInTopic":56914,"prevInTime":56912,"nextInTime":56914,"topicId":56897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... kids actually know this and that, when they really don t, when really the kids are repeating things from short term memory.

Well, they are. Just not what the object of the<br/>\nlearning exercise was intended to convey. For instance, tons of<br/>\nworksheet answers are in the form of matching, which is GREAT for<br/>\nexercising the thinking that perceives/intuits rather than<br/>\nthinks/deducts. In other words, the kids may not get what the matching<br/>\nis about. They may simply notice the shape of the &quot;ing&quot; words they&#39;re<br/>\ncircling ... as all those have a similar shape they can obviously see<br/>\nwithout the least bit of cognitive intake that it means ING as in<br/>\nsomething that takes place in the present. They may get all the<br/>\nanswers correct with no notion of the meaning of the exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any of their old worksheets, go look at them and ask<br/>\nyourself if the learning is really provable. Perhaps the twins and<br/>\ntheir classmates were seeing all kinds of other things than would be<br/>\nintended and implied in an adult&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow go back and think how your own school experience went. Do you<br/>\nremember exactly when you learned to read? How old were you?

You need to find ways to see them differently.  See <br/>\nlearning differently.  Right now the learning you are seeing is in schoolish <br/>\nterms.  The way that you describe what they do seems as if they are deschooling <br/>\nnicely, but that YOU need it way more!  Anytime you insert your schoolish <br/>\nthinking onto what they are doing and they feel it, you&#39;ll need to push the <br/>\nreset button and start over.<br/>\n<br/>\n***But even simple words they knew and used every day before, I need<br/>\nto help them spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave they unlearned to write?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will they start learning it again? Will they? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously they didn&#39;t really know them in school.  Schools have a really <br/>\ninteresting way in tricking parents and kids into thinking and believing that <br/>\nkids actually know this and that, when they really don&#39;t, when really the kids <br/>\nare repeating things from short term memory.  Schools use that as a tool for <br/>\nteaching.  You see it all over in the way people believe that learning happens. <br/>\n There are lots of people who really truly believe that repetition IS how you <br/>\nteach and it IS how kids learn.  It&#39;s not very fast or efficient.  It takes <br/>\nyears of repetition to achieve actual knowledge, if it ever happens and <br/>\nsometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of school it might take years to learn how to read or write too, but in <br/>\nthe mean time, kids are learning other things.  Before Chamille could read, she <br/>\nlistened to books on cd and tape and watched movies and played intricate games <br/>\nthat relied on elaborate story lines.  The video games she liked had really good <br/>\nback stories.  Her imaginative outside made up games were really intense.  She <br/>\nmade things for her stories.  By the time reading connected for her, she had an <br/>\nidea of how stories worked, she understood vocabulary and phrasing.  She KNEW <br/>\nthings to connect to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things kids read in school were boring.  Chamille really didn&#39;t like early <br/>\nreaders, the stories and such were very basic, too basic.<br/>\n<br/>\n***They don&#39;t know<br/>\nbasic math anymore either. They will read comic books, they read their<br/>\nPokemon cards, they read online prompts, but not books. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are doing real reading then.  If they are playing Pokemon then they are <br/>\ndoing basic math.  If you didn&#39;t realize that, you should perhaps play with <br/>\nthem.  You will see the math skills if you do.  SEE the learning in the things <br/>\nthey are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Their imagination is vivid and wild when they play, but it&#39;s just hard work<br/>\nto read, and not enjoyable at all. They are stimulated by visual things,<br/>\nillustrations (one of them collects a book series with titles like<br/>\nDragonology, Vampireology because they are beautifully illustrated - he<br/>\nenjoys looking at them), tv, video games, internet. But the written words in<br/>\nbooks don&#39;t fire up their imagination. My husband thinks that their interest<br/>\nin books has diminished after we started allowing tv alot more.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem they ever had an interest in books.  They might not ever.  Some <br/>\npeople don&#39;t.  Most of my husband&#39;s extended family do not have bookshelves in <br/>\ntheir homes, they have magazine racks.  They all went to school.  My kids are <br/>\nnot big book readers, but they LOVE books when they want to read one.  Chamille <br/>\nhas read quite a few books since she started reading at the age of 11.  Yet, <br/>\nshe&#39;s still not an avid reader of books.  Not like I am.  If they like TV and <br/>\nmovies, there are some really amazing things that can come out of that.  Margaux <br/>\nis watching the entire series of Xena Warrior Princess and knows a lot about <br/>\nGreek mythology because of it, and it connects with her interest in looking for <br/>\nstars.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like little feelers reaching out and grabbing at what they find <br/>\ninteresting.  If there is interest then they will remember it and build on that <br/>\nknowledge.  That&#39;s how natural learning works.  You can&#39;t see it if you are <br/>\nlooking for what school does.  It&#39;s bigger than school and harder to see at <br/>\nfirst.  School is obvious in what it does and shows, it&#39;s measurable, even if <br/>\nthe measurements don&#39;t necessarily measure real learning, they measure what <br/>\nlooks like learning, even if nothing is learned.  They do it often, so often <br/>\nthat parents and kids believe it to be the real thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Success to him is tied in with a<br/>\ngood education (college) and a good job.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is good evidence lately that a college education doesn&#39;t have the greatest <br/>\npay off any more.

They&#39;re not learning in any kind of way that matters to them, so the information falls by the wayside very quickly. All the &quot;basic&quot; skills are exactly that, basic. If your kids don&#39;t see a need to use them yet, they will eventually. For now, give them more time to heal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;They will read comic books, they read their<br/>\n&gt; Pokemon cards, they read online prompts, but not books.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;But not books&quot; - that&#39;s something for you to think about and question. Why should they read books? You&#39;ve been told over and over that reading books is valuable until you&#39;ve accepted that hook, line and sinker, but many people don&#39;t read books and don&#39;t suffer in the least as a result of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd is 9 and rarely reads books, and when she does they&#39;re usually graphic novels. She enjoys reading instructions and non-fiction, though - magazine articles and how-to books in particular. I&#39;ve been looking for more graphic novels for her and found many books and series that have been adapted to graphic form, as well as books written originally in that form. Its worth taking the time to go to a bookstore with a good graphic novel section and seeing what they have if its something they enjoy, but if they&#39;re not much of a fan of books at all, its not a crisis. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I don&#39;t use French for a while, I feel a bit rusty when I start<br/>\n&gt; speaking it again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The difference is, there are lots of reasons for adults to read on a regular basis. Your kid are unlikely to experience a world in which print doesn&#39;t surround them every day. There&#39;s an exericise in some book of meditations for artists (The Artists Way, I think) where one tries to not-read for a week - its difficult because text is soooooo very prevalent. So don&#39;t worry that they won&#39;t find reading useful. They just may never do it for pleasure, and that&#39;s okay. I drive to work every day, but I don&#39;t drive for pleasure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When we want to watch a movie with them they first ask &quot;is it a learning<br/>\n&gt; movie?&quot; because if they think it is then they are not interested. They do<br/>\n&gt; not want to learn anything. They say they don&#39;t need to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It took Ray a couple years after leaving school to stop saying he hated learning. The idea that &quot;learning&quot; is something painful and unpleasant is one of the hurts schooling inflicts. Give your guys time to heal. Don&#39;t offer them anything that looks or feels like school or homeschool or &quot;learning&quot; - every time you offer, you set back the deschooling clock. Offer lots of light-heartedness, be playful and fun. If you offer movies or stories, make sure they have lots of boy-appeal (or whatever gets them smiling and giggling). <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning happens all the time. You don&#39;t need to tell them that, and in fact if you&#39;ve been telling them that, stop right away! Don&#39;t talk about learning, it will sound like schoolishness to them. Its more important right now that You come to see learning happening all the time, so that you can relax about that aspect. Pokemon games are full of math and logic. Pokemon shows and movies are full of social issues and all sorts of scientific principles. Comics are full of marvelous use of language, even comics that use very few words, as well as social commentary, and the eloquent use of line as a means of expressing personality, emotion and movement in a 2d, static form. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;their attention span is SO<br/>\n&gt; short. In the middle of a conversation, they will start talking about<br/>\n&gt; totally different things, like that fly on the ceiling. Or just walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another way of saying this is that they have little tolerance for boredom. That&#39;s not a terrible thing, they&#39;re communicating something important: they&#39;re not interested in what you have to say. Its up to you to work on being more interesting - talk about things that interst them, or better, become a model listener! Ask and listen, and if they don&#39;t want to talk, watch them with fascination. Better communication between parents and kids starts with parents being more attentive. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband is so worried about their future, how will they learn anything if<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t read? How will they succeed?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they do read - they just don&#39;t read stories. So what? You don&#39;t need to read stories to run a business, to be a graphic designer or an artisan, or a carpenter, or an engineer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the way different people deal with a set of directions. Some people read the whole set of directions before they start, some look at the diagrams and figures, some dive right in without looking at anything. None of those are inherently better strategies, they&#39;re different approaches that depend on how a person learns and solves problems. If you tend to read the directions, though, the experimental learning looks utterly daft, and if you&#39;re experimental you&#39;ll wonder why someone else is wasting his time reading all that gibberish. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re only just starting to get a chance to discover how your kids learn. Step back more, be more attentive. If you need things written down, take notes. If you need to ask questions, as here instead of bothering your kids with them. They need time to discover how They learn, and to some extent they won&#39;t be able to do that until they heal from the schoolish hurts.

My daughter almost<br/>\n9 tells me categorically &quot;I don&#39;t like studying&quot;.  How strong is this<br/>\nfeeling I can see in her eyes and her voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe too asks for spellings stuff when she writes a card. Very early in our<br/>\ndeschooling stage, I used to get upset. Now I try to do this lovingly and<br/>\njoyously. Still I fall back to old ways sometimes. But I try to be alert as<br/>\nmuch as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my son who is 4 and a half. It is going to be easier since he never<br/>\nwent to school. I feel more confident in unschooling ever since I stopped<br/>\nteaching as my daughter sees as studying.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can read and understand and follow all instructions on computer games.<br/>\nSo thats fine. And all TV guides and programme schedules. So that great<br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son has on his own, i am amazed figured out  T because he loves trains,<br/>\nI since thats his name Ishaan, S because he loves ships, P because he loves<br/>\nplanes. And when he sees H he says hot. I am amazed and full of awe.<br/>\n<br/>\nT is his favourite letter since T is for train for Titanic and T-rex. He<br/>\nalso knows D because of Dinosaurs. And he recognises H and M because his<br/>\nsister is a great fan of Hannah Montana.<br/>\n<br/>\nDola<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Aug 19, 2010 at 11:57 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-we took our now 9 year old twin boys out of school in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; November last year.

It is a really cool little game in which you solve puzzles by writing/ spelling the objects you might use for a solution and then the program draws the objects for you. We saw a commercial for it just before Christmas this past year and my son asked if we could get it for him. Prior to playing Scribblenauts he had really not expressed much interest in writing/spelling. When he first started playing the game he asked us to spell words for him almost constantly, which we did. Now he is spelling very independently when he plays. Occasionally, he will ask for the spelling of a word, most of the time he will just give it a go himself. He is really looking forward to Super Scribblenauts being released this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Can reading and writing be unlearned?","postDate":"1282199238","msgId":56899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcyNTUzMUVDLTRBMzMtNDZFNS05ODc3LUQzNjYyQzgwMjUxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9T3N5UlNFRjVkQnNFRVBoellxTHNuNUo9ODFSclRzcXpNSGVOaEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9T3N5UlNFRjVkQnNFRVBoellxTHNuNUo9ODFSclRzcXpNSGVOaEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56897,"nextInTopic":56902,"prevInTime":56898,"nextInTime":56900,"topicId":56897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-we took our now 9 year old twin boys out of school in November last year.

They never learned to read well in school - and before<br/>\nwe knew about unschooling, we took them to tutors and reading classes a lot.<br/>\nThey seemed to be learning to read from the repetitive nature of the year<br/>\nlong reading program.... and then we did a 360 and took them out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, we have not pushed reading or writing, but letting them do it<br/>\nnaturally in games and whenever they wanted to pick up a book. They went<br/>\nfrom being budding readers and beginning writers to nothing. They don&#39;t know<br/>\nbasic math anymore either. They will read comic books, they read their<br/>\nPokemon cards, they read online prompts, but not books. They never write,<br/>\nand when I ask them to sign a birthday card, they can hardly remember how<br/>\nthey spell their own names anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will occasionally ask me how to spell words because they want to find a<br/>\ngame or buy something on the internet, they know where the letters are on a<br/>\nkeyboard. But even simple words they knew and used every day before, I need<br/>\nto help them spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave they unlearned to write?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will they start learning it again? Will they? My husband has such a<br/>\npessimistic view on this that it&#39;s getting to me too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I don&#39;t use French for a while, I feel a bit rusty when I start<br/>\nspeaking it again. A friend of mine who went to school in France with me<br/>\nmore than 20 years ago, has forgotten everything he learned that year. He<br/>\nhas no French anymore because he didn&#39;t use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the comparisons. Our oldest son read well at 6 or 7,<br/>\ndevouring Harry Patter and other thick books by 8 and 9. How do I handle<br/>\ncomparisons, it&#39;s so hard not to compare and then judge. And it&#39;s unfair on<br/>\nthem, they always seem to be on the losing side being the youngest and the<br/>\nweakest. Big brother will always be 2 years older and stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we want to watch a movie with them they first ask &quot;is it a learning<br/>\nmovie?&quot; because if they think it is then they are not interested. They do<br/>\nnot want to learn anything. They say they don&#39;t need to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The twins do have differing personality traits, but are very similar in<br/>\nboth looks and preferences and opinions. They are two different persons,<br/>\nwith different interests, and at the same time so in tune with each other.<br/>\nSo when I write &quot;they&quot; it may seem like I&#39;m lumping them together as one,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s because they have those things in common.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried reading to them, it&#39;s boring (maybe my accent isn&#39;t right<br/>\neither). Audioboks are boring too. We talk about things as they happen and<br/>\nwe make connections, and that works better, but their attention span is SO<br/>\nshort. In the middle of a conversation, they will start talking about<br/>\ntotally different things, like that fly on the ceiling. Or just walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir imagination is vivid and wild when they play, but it&#39;s just hard work<br/>\nto read, and not enjoyable at all. They are stimulated by visual things,<br/>\nillustrations (one of them collects a book series with titles like<br/>\nDragonology, Vampireology because they are beautifully illustrated - he<br/>\nenjoys looking at them), tv, video games, internet. But the written words in<br/>\nbooks don&#39;t fire up their imagination. My husband thinks that their interest<br/>\nin books has diminished after we started allowing tv alot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is so worried about their future, how will they learn anything if<br/>\nthey don&#39;t read? How will they succeed? Success to him is tied in with a<br/>\ngood education (college) and a good job.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur boys are growing up trilingual and are actively speaking all three<br/>\nlanguages although English is the language of choice and comfort. Can this<br/>\nhave something to do with their seeming inability, or unwillingness, to read<br/>\nEnglish? Our oldest son didn&#39;t have these issues, and now he can even read<br/>\nsome French and Norwegian. Comparing again...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your insights,<br/>\nKatrine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56917,"nextTopicId":56876}}
