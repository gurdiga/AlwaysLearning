Do I think<br/>\nshe&#39;s seeing fairies, you bet.  Do I think the fairies are real?  No.<br/>\nI think she really wants to see fairies.  Her brain made the fairies.<br/>\nI once read about some siblings who dug another woman&#39;s eyes out with<br/>\nkitchen spoons because they thought they could see the devil in them or<br/>\nsome such.  Lovely. <br/>\nI think there are a lot of explanations for things like ghosts, etc. <br/>\nthat are based in science, that the ghost experiencers simply don&#39;t<br/>\naccept.  We want to believe what we see.  We rely on that every day and<br/>\nif we admit maybe we can&#39;t believe our own eyes then we could be in<br/>\ntrouble.  But it&#39;s really true.  We can&#39;t always trust our own eyes and<br/>\nour own brain.  Chemical and hormonal imbalance can cause all kinds of<br/>\ninteresting things.<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve ever known anyone with schizophrenia you know there is a<br/>\nscientific explanation for it, a medical explanation, but it&#39;s still just<br/>\nsooo freaky you can understand why in the old days folks thought the<br/>\nvictims of this disease were possessed by the devil.  Same with Epilepsy.<br/>\n And if , not admitting anything here, just, supposing,&lt;g&gt;  you ever took<br/>\nLSD you would know for a real and true fact that it&#39;s possible to see and<br/>\nexperience ALL KINDS of things that simply are not there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if someone wants to believe in fairies and they&#39;re not likely to<br/>\ncause anyone any harm, it&#39;s ok with me.

We have the<br/>\npower of choice, and the ability to recognize<br/>\nunhealthy patterns of behavior and thought in<br/>\nourselves and take steps towards healing.  However, we<br/>\nhave to learn so many things first that children do<br/>\nnot know, such as what is unhealthy and what is<br/>\nhealthy, how to recognize patterns of behavior early<br/>\non in relationships, how to respond to situations in<br/>\nnew/positive ways, how to deal well with people, how<br/>\nto heal and many other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
