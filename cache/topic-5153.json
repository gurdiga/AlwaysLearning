My mother would flatter about<br/>\nsomething &quot;oh you&#39;ve fixed your hair so nice&quot; and then to my sister she<br/>\nwould say about me, &quot;the little fool&quot;.  It happened with everyone, you<br/>\nwere in on her joke at the expense of a sibling or you were the butt of<br/>\none.  To this day I think people are secretly ridiculing me if they pay<br/>\nme a compliment.  It&#39;s not the worst thing in the world and it surely<br/>\nhasn&#39;t ruined me, but I think all the time about how nice it would be not<br/>\nto have that in my head at all.   I really like the idea of all these<br/>\nkids growing up without all that embarrassment and shame.  I like that<br/>\nthese parents don&#39;t make their kids feel like fools.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, good for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5137,"nextTopicId":5155}}
