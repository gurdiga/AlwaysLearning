I think, at least I hope, I&#39;m pretty comfortable with my children finding their own view of success.  I know I still cringe when my mother (very well meaning, of course) tells me that I &quot;could have&quot; been anything I wanted to be.

What are your answers to these<br/>\nquestions?~~<br/>\n  Hmmm.....I think my answer might sound like &quot;They learn cultural norms by observing the culture around them, and with help and explanations from me and their father and other trusted adults.  Of course some adherance to societal laws is necessary, and my children are learning about laws as they grow.  We are blessed to live in a country where one can create a community of like-minded individuals wherever they go.  There is no need to follow the dominant culture if one feels that it is not in keeping with the principles they choose to live by.

Do you? Great awareness of cultural norms<br/>\nis part of radical unschooling, to me. How much or how little each of<br/>\nus, and each of our children chooses to conform will depend on how<br/>\nmuch each one cares to and is comfortable fitting in, perhaps. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are often consequences for extreme non-conformism. While through<br/>\nthe broader culture it seems fairly easy for young people to become<br/>\ndisconnected to the point of lost, this is not common in radically<br/>\nunschooling families because of the close, open, thoughtful<br/>\ncommunication and ways of being that are fostered. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a specific worry? Or just a creeping, low-level sort of<br/>\nwondering. It&#39;s a bit hard to speak effectively to very broad<br/>\n&#39;what-ifs&#39;.
