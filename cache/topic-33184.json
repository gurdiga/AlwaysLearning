It&#39;s not  <br/>\nenough to mindfully make choices about what to do; make choices about  <br/>\nwhat to say (or write), and how, and when.   Listen to the words your  <br/>\nsubconscious is offering up for you to speak.  What are you  <br/>\nthinking!?  (Nobody needs to tell us what they&#39;re thinking, but it&#39;s  <br/>\ngood when you&#39;re at least wondering, to yourself, what you&#39;re  <br/>\nthinking. &lt;g&gt;  Especially when posting about your children in public.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the purposes of this list, it&#39;s often much more valuable when  <br/>\nsomeone is NOT careful with words and thoughts and they give us  <br/>\nsomething to poke at, turn over, examine and analyze.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I will rephrase:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you (the reader) don&#39;t want what you write to reveal things you  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t intend to reveal, be careful with words on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want help discovering how confusing thoughts are blocking your  <br/>\nability to think clearly, pour it on out here and people will poke at  <br/>\nyour words, turn them over, examine and analyze.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think that sounds horrible, don&#39;t post.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think it sounds wonderful but you don&#39;t want it done to YOUR  <br/>\nwords, read but don&#39;t post.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think it&#39;s horrible and should never be done anywhere, scoot.   <br/>\nThere are other lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor any purposes in your entire life, private or public, choose your  <br/>\nwords.  Don&#39;t be bullied by your own unconscious thoughts!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33180,"nextTopicId":33208}}
