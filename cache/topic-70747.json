Two things relating to this discussion, I think:  <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n\t• From authorities to advertisers, we are bombarded with the message, explicit and implicit, “Trust Us. We know what is best, we are the experts.” Here&#39;s some timeless advice from Natural Life Magazine&#39;s archives about why that&#39;s a problem and what to do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t• “If we taught babies to talk as most skills are taught in school, they would memorize lists of sounds in a predetermined order and practice them alone in a closet.” ~ Linda Darling-Hammond. This is one of many such quotes on the Life Learning Magazine website<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the first one.   Don&#39;t they survive on advertising?  Aren&#39;t there messages in that?  Isn&#39;t the newsletter itself the announcements of authorities?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the second, we do not teach babies to talk.  It&#39;s not about how we teach them.  They learn naturally.  And the quote is by an education professor, a school reformer (of sorts), and not a homeschooler.

Maybe the schoolish<br/>\npressure to succeed (or our take-charge, self-driven nature that makes us<br/>\ndecide it&#39;s worth all the work to be an unschooler) causes us to pursue the<br/>\nloftiest or &#39;highest-ranked&#39; goal, which is touted as radical unschooling,<br/>\nbefore we or our families are ready. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this so true for myself and stated so well.

I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that the questions in my head are changing from &quot;Is it unschooling if<br/>\nI.?&quot; to &quot;how can I solve this problem while maintaining the highest level of<br/>\nrespect and joy for everyone in the family?&quot; I&#39;m certainly not ready to give<br/>\nadvice or allay fears, but I am new and I suppose I will only be new once.<br/>\nMaybe my feelings as one of the new ones here will help someone who has been<br/>\nhere a while to remember this time and speak truth to us while allowing us<br/>\nsome time to process and implement.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no perfect method or exact way, it&#39;s not a one size fits all but<br/>\nwhat is? Really?  I loved Sandra&#39;s book and after reading it I think that&#39;s<br/>\nwhen it all started to come together for me and realize it&#39;s more about the<br/>\noutcome, the intention, getting it right for our family and succeeding<br/>\nwhere it works for us. I think there is a basic philosophy, sometimes a<br/>\nhard line of what not to do and what to do, but from Sandra and others in<br/>\nthis group its about family first, keeping your marriage happy (I love this<br/>\npositiveness) and getting everything in sync with basic principals. It<br/>\ntakes time and with everything that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere (perhaps a Facebook group) it was mentioned the idea about<br/>\nchildren getting frustrated with something and saying &quot;I can&#39;t do this, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot good at this or that&quot; and someone mentioned to remind them that they<br/>\njust haven&#39;t practiced the thing or ability enough to be perfect at it.  I<br/>\nlove that idea and we need to remember it ourselves, this is a new thing,<br/>\nand yeah I&#39;m not as good at it as Sandra or someone else, but it&#39;s new.  I<br/>\nneed practice and practice takes time. And I think that&#39;s where the idea of<br/>\ndeschooling comes in.  That&#39;s time to just get over all the gitters and<br/>\nself doubt and fear and punishment we give ourselves on not just being able<br/>\nto accept this new thought process and be perfect at it immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s easy for me to see why this list may be frustrating for some.

It demands being able to hear criticism, and<br/>\nthen being able to move on from that point. But I can also see why so many<br/>\nvalue this list because it is unwavering. People telling you what you want<br/>\nto hear is nice, but only for a little while. Real friends tell the truth<br/>\nand point out ugliness and beauty as it really is.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAmen Katie, I agree wholeheartedly.

However, I have found that when I mention<br/>\nthat we are unschooling to the homeschoolers I know, I either 1. get a blank<br/>\nstare or a question of &quot;what is that?&quot;, or 2. get grilled by someone who<br/>\nwants to make sure I really am what I say I am. (Note: I want to<br/>\nspecifically exclude the HSC Campers from #2, they were fabulous!

I think I quoted something from Sandra&#39;s book about how to<br/>\ntell others about your decision to unschool, and she replied &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a<br/>\n&quot;Dodd-er&quot;&quot; (in a very unkind tone).

Several minutes later she approached<br/>\nme again, noting that I couldn&#39;t possibly be an unschooler if I belonged to<br/>\nthis group that offered classes, to which I responded that my daughter was<br/>\ntaking a machine sewing class and then immediately felt irritated that I<br/>\nfelt like I needed to justify my &#39;lifestyle&#39; to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost recently it happened with that Christian list Sandra shared. I thought<br/>\nit would be a great group for me to join for some additional resources.

I wasn&#39;t sure how to answer those questions. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure I have a stance. If I said I spanked my kids when they were little,<br/>\nwould that mean I can&#39;t join? If I said I regretted it and don&#39;t do it<br/>\nanymore, would that matter? If I said they had an approximate bedtime and<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t let them play video games until 8am because I tried a<br/>\nfree-for-all right away and they were waking up at 5am to get to the TV<br/>\nfirst and then spending the rest of the day crying and melting down from<br/>\nexhaustion would that exclude me? Should I have to provide that entire<br/>\nexplanation to be an good-enough unschooler to join the list?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a new unschooler, it can sometimes feel like the pressure is immediate.<br/>\nMaybe we hear all the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts first because they are shared most<br/>\noften, or maybe we hear them loudest because they go against what we are<br/>\ncurrently doing and feeling in the most extreme way. Maybe the schoolish<br/>\npressure to succeed (or our take-charge, self-driven nature that makes us<br/>\ndecide it&#39;s worth all the work to be an unschooler) causes us to pursue the<br/>\nloftiest or &#39;highest-ranked&#39; goal, which is touted as radical unschooling,<br/>\nbefore we or our families are ready. I feel the message (not necessarily<br/>\nhere) is sometimes &quot;Yes you can unschool, but can you radically unschool?&quot;<br/>\nright from the get-go.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband says &quot;There&#39;s always fanatics about everything.&quot; And I&#39;ve taken<br/>\nthe road that I don&#39;t say I&#39;m an unschooler much. I think that&#39;s sad. But<br/>\nwithout much history to back me up or much visible success under my belt I&#39;m<br/>\nsetting myself up for attack from those who feel they have to prove<br/>\nunschooling it at least &gt;this level&lt; or higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have many questions about how to live this new lifestyle with my kids and<br/>\nmy family, but I am still comfortable waiting and watching for now. I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that the questions in my head are changing from &quot;Is it unschooling if<br/>\nI.?&quot; to &quot;how can I solve this problem while maintaining the highest level of<br/>\nrespect and joy for everyone in the family?&quot; I&#39;m certainly not ready to give<br/>\nadvice or allay fears, but I am new and I suppose I will only be new once.<br/>\nMaybe my feelings as one of the new ones here will help someone who has been<br/>\nhere a while to remember this time and speak truth to us while allowing us<br/>\nsome time to process and implement.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for me to see why this list may be frustrating for some. To belong<br/>\nto this list demands change. It demands looking at yourself in the mirror,<br/>\nand that&#39;s not always pleasant. It demands being able to hear criticism, and<br/>\nthen being able to move on from that point. But I can also see why so many<br/>\nvalue this list because it is unwavering. People telling you what you want<br/>\nto hear is nice, but only for a little while. Real friends tell the truth<br/>\nand point out ugliness and beauty as it really is.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-Katie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70748,"nextTopicId":70724}}
