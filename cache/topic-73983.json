You might find resources online (and someone here might have an idea) but there&#39;s no special &quot;unschooling&quot; way of handling this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had problems with another boy when my kids were five and younger.  Several in our playgroup had had similar problems, and it ultimately broke that group up (some of us reformed as an unschooling playgroup).  Because I didn&#39;t make a big deal of it with my kids (who were not the initiators of it), they don&#39;t even remember it (Kirby probably remembers the loss of the friendship).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was willing for the friendship to continue as long as a parent was present all the time, but the other mom was too humiliated to continue.  She offered to pay for counselling for my kids, but I didn&#39;t want it solidified in their memories, so I declined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTelling your so that he definitely must stop doing that is probably a good idea, if you can find a time and way to do it gently and plainly, not in a panicky or shame-filled way.  Some things are not to be shared, or done in public.  Don&#39;t narrow it down to showing genitalia.  Pooping or peeing should be discreetly done (mens&#39; rooms urinals or camping in the woods might be exceptions—peeing at a stop on a road trip), without showing off, without doing it in front of females (or vice versa, for girls).    Picking noses (eating boogers), similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nBiological functions should be taken care of without an audience, and that might be a way to discuss it with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard a couple of parents suggest that sex play among children should not be discouraged.  I disagree strongly.  Where would they cut it off?  Sex play among adolescents can land a kid in juvenile lock-up.  And on up the line, depending on consensuality and ages and local laws.  But flashing is never okay at any age.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very young child in his own home playing with his penis shouldnt be over-reacted to, but he should also be asked to do that when he&#39;s alone, instead of in front of other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":528903363,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;saralouwho@...&gt;","profile":"saralouwho@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Children&#39;s Bodies","postDate":"1396121321","msgId":73983,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxoNzZ0OSsxYmNzOWRkQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73984,"prevInTime":73982,"nextInTime":73984,"topicId":73983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I got this email from my next door neighbor and good friend: Actually There is a problem..
