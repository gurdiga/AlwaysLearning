I live in a predominately Amish/Mennonite community, and a lot of them are homeschoolers, many of whom use or have used Rod and Staff. There are a lot of things that are not in the Bible that are important to these people, such as tradition (wedding, funeral, etc.), gathering together for meals, family first, etc. Almost all of the Anabaptists and Mennonites I know are the sweetest, gentlest people I&#39;ve ever met. <br/>\n<br/>\ndenice<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20178,"nextTopicId":20181}}
