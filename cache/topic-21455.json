Forty days & nights? &lt;G&gt;***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a little blurb from the NASA web site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/10jan_earthquake.htm?list610078\">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/10jan_earthquake.htm?list610078</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to the above address and read there are images and links, but<br/>\nhere&#39;s the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n How the Earthquake <br/>\naffected Earth<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dec. 26th Indonesian megathrust earthquake quickened Earth&#39;s rotation<br/>\nand changed our planet&#39;s shape. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nJanuary 10, 2005: NASA scientists studying the Indonesian earthquake of<br/>\nDec. 26, 2004, have calculated that it slightly changed our planet&#39;s<br/>\nshape, shaved almost 3 microseconds from the length of the day, and<br/>\nshifted the North Pole by centimeters.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Benjamin Fong Chao of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr.<br/>\nRichard Gross of NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said all earthquakes<br/>\nhave some effect on Earth&#39;s rotation. It&#39;s just that the effects are,<br/>\nusually, barely noticeable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis one was not usual: The devastating megathrust earthquake registered<br/>\nnine on the new &quot;moment&quot; scale (modified Richter scale), making it the<br/>\nfourth largest &#39;quake in one hundred years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChao and Gross routinely calculate earthquakes&#39; effects on Earth&#39;s shape<br/>\nand rotation. They also study changes in polar motion--that is, the<br/>\nshifting of the North Pole. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to their latest calculations, the Dec. 26th earthquake shifted<br/>\nEarth&#39;s &quot;mean North Pole&quot; by about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in the<br/>\ndirection of 145 degrees east longitude, more or less toward Guam in the<br/>\nPacific Ocean. This shift is continuing a long-term seismic trend<br/>\nidentified in previous studies.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThe quake also affected Earth&#39;s shape. Chao and Gross calculated that<br/>\nEarth&#39;s oblateness (flattening on the top and bulging at the equator)<br/>\ndecreased by a small amount--about one part in 10 billion. This continues<br/>\nthe trend of earthquakes making Earth less oblate. Less oblate means more<br/>\nround. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also found the earthquake decreased the length of the day by 2.68<br/>\nmicroseconds. (A microsecond is one millionth of a second.) In other<br/>\nwords, Earth spins a little faster than it did before. This change in<br/>\nspin is related to the change in oblateness. It&#39;s like a spinning skater<br/>\ndrawing arms closer to the body resulting in a faster spin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these changes have yet been measured--only calculated. But Chao<br/>\nand Gross hope to detect the changes when Earth rotation data from ground<br/>\nbased and space-borne sensors are reviewed.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":148348246,"authorName":"SHERRY LANGEVIN","from":"SHERRY LANGEVIN &lt;luckymermaid@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] tsunami & Noah","postDate":"1105547949","msgId":21467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMTEyMTYzOTA5LjczODMzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyLjYwNzU5M2ZlLjJmMTZhOTU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21462,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":21466,"nextInTime":21468,"topicId":21455,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I dont recall what radio station I heard this on, but they mentioned that the tsunami affected the levels of water in wells in Maryland . . .
