If you are going into to Omaha<br/>\nHenry Doorly Zoo <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.omahazoo.com/\">http://www.omahazoo.com/</a> is quite good--it has grown<br/>\nin leaps and bounds since I was a child going around the zoo with my<br/>\nlittle yellow elephant key that you would plug into a box and it would<br/>\nstart of an informative talk on the animal in the cage in front of<br/>\nyou. And the best possible place to spend a day is in Omaha, so long<br/>\nas you can stand the smell of cigarette smoke, The Antiquarium<br/>\nBookstore. It has an incredible music store in the basement and books<br/>\nand an art gallery upstairs and the nicest man in the world runs the<br/>\nplace.  Tom Rudloff and his sister started it years ago, and now he<br/>\nsits in the front window in (well he used to) bear claw slippers and<br/>\nwelcomes customers and talks to friends and smokes cigarette after<br/>\ncigarette.  So if you do buy any books there you&#39;ll know where they<br/>\ncame from for a while after.  Simon and Linnaea didn&#39;t really enjoy<br/>\nthe experience the last time we were in Omaha, but you may need to<br/>\nhave a disaffected quality, or at least a teenage sense of humor, to<br/>\nreally enjoy the Antiquarium.  It always feels a bit of home to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t find any good links to the Antiquarium.  It is mentioned in<br/>\na bunch of blogs and antiquarium.com gets you to a Bill Farmer<br/>\nmemorial.  Bill Farmer has a permanant exhibit at the Antiquarium.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not be any fun to drive a trailer into downtown Omaha, and<br/>\nyou may just be focused on the last leg of the journey to KC at that<br/>\npoint. There are parks along the Platte where you can camp like Eugene<br/>\nT. Mahoney state park which is on I-80, I think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be back in the states this summer making the trek from Minnesota<br/>\nthrough western Nebraska (my brother has 200 acres near Valentine) and<br/>\nColorado to Albuquerque and then back up through Wichita, so looking<br/>\nthrough the sites in the area has me excited. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, DACunefare@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; A few miles north of 80, just outside of Grand Island Nebraska, is<br/>\nthe Stuhr <br/>\n&gt; Museum of the Prarie Pioneer.
