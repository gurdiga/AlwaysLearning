One of my friends<br/>\nsaid it can&#39;t be good for her to stay up late.

Why would there be a relationship between getting enough<br/>\nsleep later in on in the day than getting enough sleep earlier on? It<br/>\nseems that sleeping in late would offset going to bed late. Linnaea<br/>\nstopped taking naps around 2 and she started going to sleep earlier. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t planned, it just happened. Simon is only now, at 11, staying up<br/>\nlate and sleeping in. He&#39;s still asleep on the floor behind me after a<br/>\nsleepover last night, it&#39;s 10 am. Much later in the day, I think he got up at about 11. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was actually earlier than 2. There is a legend of my sleeplessness as a young, young child. My family including my paternal grandparents were camping in Washington, I&#39;m trying to figure out how old I would have been. I would have been 22 months to 25 months. Anyhow. We had a VW van and they set up my bed in the van  as they were worried I would crawl out into Grizzly territory if I&#39;d been in a tent. Everyone else slept in tents. My grandpa got up early or was up late to check the fire or to take a leak, maybe, and I had unrolled the window in the front and was just attempting to crawl out. At 2, the legends tell me, I was wandering the house at night and my parents had to be careful to keep their door closed so that I wouldn&#39;t walk in on them like the boy in the movie Parents and be traumatized for life, of course they weren&#39;t also eating human flesh, which might have taken the edge off my imagined trauma. At 2 I also protested taking naps by running<br/>\n away from home. I was brought back by the police having made it 2 blocks away. I can remember sleeplessness from 4, maybe, maybe 3. I don&#39;t remember sleep at 2. I just e-mailed my mom and she said that she doesn&#39;t remember me EVER sleeping at a &quot;reasonable&quot; hour (the quotes were both mine and hers, the capitals were hers).<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 2. She is still nursing and we have co-slept since she<br/>\nwas 6 months old. What was written above sounds so much like her.<br/>\n(Schuyler, how do you know what you were like at 2 yo?? do you<br/>\nremember, or is it from family telling you?) She will stay awake until<br/>\nshe is exhausted. She has never had a set bedtime. Right now if she<br/>\ntakes a nap she stays up late (the past 4 nights 1 am, 11:45,<br/>\nmidnight, 11:45) She is also starting to sleep in till 10 or sometimes<br/>\nlater when she goes to bed late. She has been skipping nap a couple<br/>\ntimes a week starting around her 2nd Birthday (she is almost 2 1/2<br/>\nnow). So today she skipped nap, and fell asleep at 7 pm. However she<br/>\nhad a hard day. One of my friends said it can&#39;t be good for her to<br/>\nstay up late. I said I think it is ok, she is eating well, sleeping<br/>\nwhen she is tired, usually happy, and growing and healthy. The hard<br/>\npart is staying up that late sometimes. I am a night owl too, so it is<br/>\nnot too much of an issue, but I babysit other children and sometimes I<br/>\nhave to get up earlier, and she usually wakes up earlier on those days. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess for the most part I am really happy with how we are doing<br/>\nthings, even though I don&#39;t really know anyone else who does it this<br/>\nway. It is so encouraging to read about other people&#39;s experience,<br/>\nboth their own, and their children&#39;s. I wonder if there are other<br/>\nthings I could do better or differently -- for instance, she loves to<br/>\nwatch movies and I wonder sometimes if that is just keeping her awake.<br/>\nI love the peaceful nights when she goes to sleep so happily, and I<br/>\nfeel bad when it seems like she is overtired and unhappy (and to<br/>\nclarify, she falls asleep where she wants and often with a movie on of<br/>\nher choice...) I know if I weren&#39;t working at all (babysitting) it<br/>\nwould be less of an issue because our schedule would be even more<br/>\nrelaxed. I am struggling right now with what is the best thing for her<br/>\nand our family. I think a lot of people we know in real life think we<br/>\nare crazy to &quot;let&quot; her stay up so late. But I don&#39;t look at it that<br/>\nway at all -- her internal clock seems set that way and I really<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t change how we do things, although I&#39;m not sure about my<br/>\nhusband! (not that he can complain since I have basically been the one<br/>\nhelping her fall asleep since she was born!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I know I am rambling. If this strikes anyone and they are inspired<br/>\nto respond I would really appreciate it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40271,"nextTopicId":40305}}
