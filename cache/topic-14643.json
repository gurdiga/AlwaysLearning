You&#39;ll have to buy your food, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be a few exhibitors. They&#39;ll want your money. Please be sure to <br/>\npatronize them---they help us BE here! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to bet that if you don&#39;t have a Jim Weiss CD yet, you WILL want <br/>\none!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;ll be tapes from last year---and Sandra will certainly bring some of <br/>\nher old ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOS will have a few books and bumper stickers for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re trying to have all the funshops free. They were last year. The Chain <br/>\nMail and Jewelry funshops *might* have an extra expense. I hope not. We&#39;re <br/>\nworking on that! Some funshops ask that you bring some things from home (The <br/>\n&quot;Wings&quot; funshops asks that you bring two pairs of tights).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a raffle---bring LOTS of money for THAT! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;I see there&#39;s the boxed supper option that&#39;s extra. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Optional. <br/>\n<br/>\n Also, the &gt; schedule online lists all these wonderful speeches that I want <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to <br/>\n&gt; hear...but what about the kids?  I understand there will be activities <br/>\n&gt; etc. planned.  Are these at the same time as the scheduled speakers? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. The kids should be quite occupied while you&#39;re listening. You might find <br/>\nyourself in the funshop room too, though!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs &gt; there a schedule yet of any of the known kids activities...or a list <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that&#39;s started?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They&#39;re coming in slowly. I&#39;m waiting for contracts and to firm things up. <br/>\nSome folks are slower than others. Keep checking the site.

For the exhibitors! And the raffle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings should be pretty well paid for by the time you send in your $$$.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Holiday Inn, Columbia","postDate":"1053704776","msgId":14671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBRjQwRUI3LjI2QjUlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTM2OTM2OTAuMzA1My44NjEyLm0xM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14667,"nextInTopic":14676,"prevInTime":14670,"nextInTime":14672,"topicId":14643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
