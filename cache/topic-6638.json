We&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthis boy at many competitions and he&#39;s very good!  He was immediately<br/>\naccepted by most of the boys on the team, and there seemed to be little<br/>\ninsecurity about his advanced abilities, but then yesterday my son told<br/>\nme that one of the lower scoring boys on the team had whispered<br/>\nsomething to him about the new boy.  It was one sentence, containing 3<br/>\nnot nice words, and was a very ugly thing to say.  The boy who said it<br/>\nis a really nice kid, and I attribute it to a degree of resentment<br/>\ntoward this new and very talented boy.  But it made me think about<br/>\nsomething.  My kids routinely tell me EVERYTHING that is said by their<br/>\nfriends and others.  It doesn&#39;t matter how bad it is, they tell me.<br/>\nSometimes they&#39;re laughing and think it&#39;s funny, sometimes they sound<br/>\ndisapproving.  At home, little is off limits in our house.  Curse words<br/>\nare tolerated, we have few TV limits, any topic is open for discussion,<br/>\nand we hide nothing from our kids.  We do expect very nice public<br/>\nbehavior, however, and we get it.  I&#39;m wondering if our laid back<br/>\nattitude at home is responsible for our kids willingness to pass on so<br/>\nmuch to us.  They never have to worry that we&#39;ll tell another parent<br/>\nthat their child behaved badly, or that we&#39;ll look down on a friend for<br/>\nsaying something socially unacceptable, or that we&#39;ll cut down on social<br/>\ntime due to another child&#39;s &quot;bad influence&quot;.  Anybody else have any<br/>\nthoughts or experience on this topic?  If this is part of the reason we<br/>\nhear so much, then conversely, parents who have strict rules at home<br/>\nmust hear very little about the things their kids are exposed to.
