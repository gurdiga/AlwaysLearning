It&#39;s pervasive by definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had many friends who&#39;ve been diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s (who generally refer to themselves as &quot;Aspies&quot;) and have read many autobiographies of people on the autism spectrum. Most of them have argued that autism *does* affect everything and all that they are. They see it as a part of their personality, a part of who they are. (I feel the need to emphasize that they&#39;re also PROUD of it!) I don&#39;t understand how the way a person&#39;s brain operates and the way they process sensory input could NOT affect everything about them. That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have an identity or a personality. It&#39;s just that autism is a part of that. It&#39;s woven into who they are like threads in a blanket.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am, from all that I&#39;ve read, most likely an Aspie myself. I am also a woman, a brunette, a Unitarian, an unschooler, a 23-year-old, a Southerner, a musician, a Trekkie, and a Beatles fan. None of those things by itself IS who I am, but each of those things is part of who I am, and each thing affects the other things. Remove any one of those threads and you&#39;d have a different blanket. They all affect everything and all that I am. Everything counts!<br/>\n<br/>\nBonnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:linda@...\">linda@...</a><br/>\nDate: Thu, 23 Jul 2009 12:00:13 -0400<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: PPP<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents, like myself, who wish for the world to see their children &quot;with autism&quot; as whole and unique have given the use of these two terms a lot of thought.

It&#39;s proper to call minority groups by what they prefer to call themselves. Autistic people generally prefer the term &quot;autistic&quot;. Mothers who want to feel more hopeful that their kids might &quot;get better&quot; have pushed for use of &quot;has autism&quot;. Autistic people themselves (whose opinions are rarely asked for) generally see autism as something that is part of them and cannot be cured or removed, and thus prefer &quot;autistic&quot;. It&#39;s a descriptive term, not a definitive one. It&#39;s just like you wouldn&#39;t say someone &quot;has gayness&quot; or &quot;participates in Christianity&quot; when you could just say they are gay or Christian. Those terms don&#39;t imply someone is &quot;defined&quot; by being gay or Christian or [trait], but it does imply that trait is an integrated part of who the person is. Saying &quot;has [trait]&quot; implies a hope that the trait can be removed from the person, which is unrealistic at best and offensive at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly deaf people usually prefer &quot;Deaf&quot; (with a capital D) to &quot;hearing-impaired&quot;. Different groups call themselves different things, but if you say &quot;has autism&quot; or &quot;is hearing-impaired&quot; to people who belong to those groups you might not get a friendly response.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhite people in this country have spent years arguing over what to call Indians, whether they should be &quot;Native Americans&quot; or &quot;American Indians&quot; or whatever. Eventually people got the bright idea to actually ask them what they call themselves. Turns out it&#39;s &quot;Indian&quot;, which they&#39;ve been called for as long as English has been part of their reality, or simply whatever specific tribe they belong to. Big surprise there?

There are grey haired murderers <br/>\nand grey haired angels of mercy. There are grey haired truck drivers <br/>\nand grey haired bicyclists. Some are the same guy.

Then it wouldn&#39;t make  <br/>\nsense.<br/>\nIs it something that parents and kids do together?<br/>\nIs it for projects parents do that are of interest to kids.  Like  <br/>\nparental show-and-tell?  That sounds fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer:   It depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation:  You could go to one session and let them see it  <br/>\nand then you&#39;d have better reason to accept it and go with it, or to  <br/>\ndissuade them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it turns to &quot;no,&quot; find something cool to do on Monday nights for a  <br/>\nwhile in those days.
