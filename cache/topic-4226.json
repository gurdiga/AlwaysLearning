Unless the Simpsons are on. <br/>\nOr something else we ALL want to watch. Then we watch it and eat together and <br/>\nthat&#39;s great too. It doesn&#39;t seem to ever be a big deal - the rest of my <br/>\nfamily is just happy to have a nice dinner on the table - nobody EVER <br/>\ncomplains about coming to eat it together.
