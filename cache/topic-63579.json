Planning one or two things a day (especially if they&#39;re outings involving getting dressed or cleaning up after) might be enough.  In special circumstances like having houseguests or holidays, overdoing is kind of expected, but those are rare occasions to which you can build up and from which you can take a quiet few days to recover.

It might help to brainstorm ideas on the way home of what they  <br/>\ncan do that will also allow you to rest. And work with them if they&#39;re  <br/>\nasking too much. An older one may jump in to meet a need. As much as  <br/>\nyou can, draw them into the problem solving rather than deciding and  <br/>\nimposing. Be the facilitator and coordinator rather than the boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you have several under 3, being tired is just part of the job  <br/>\ndescription for now! ;-) Keep your priorities low. It will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of that is expectations. If you expect that they&#39;ll meet your  <br/>\nneeds, you&#39;re bound to be disappointed when they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, a big thing, is to plan better in order to avoid pushing yourself  <br/>\nbeyond your limits as much as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it this way: If you&#39;re doing a project with a friend who finds  <br/>\nherself exhausted during it you&#39;d want to help her, right, and take a  <br/>\nbreak? But if you&#39;re doing a project with a friend who *always* gets  <br/>\nexhausted (not from a disease but because she&#39;s always doing too  <br/>\nmuch), it would be harder and harder to feel compassion each time. It  <br/>\nwould be clear that she&#39;s repeatedly planning poorly and disappointing  <br/>\nand inconveniencing you in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414737454,"authorName":"sopik@rogers.com","from":"&quot;sopik@...&quot; &lt;sopik@...&gt;","profile":"sopik@rogers.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"What do you say when you need a break?","postDate":"1319514192","msgId":63579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo4NWI4Zyt1YmE4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63582,"prevInTime":63578,"nextInTime":63580,"topicId":63579,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone, I am Mama to two glorious children...4 years out of school...happily unschooling, except sometimes...

And then, I run into trouble. I feel &quot;done&quot;, I will lovingly say that I am going to have some quiet time...or I attempt to have some quiet time in a room with my family...somehow, it doesn&#39;t always gel. My kids get clingy, or have more needs, and if I keep going, I get cranky, diffuse, not present, etc. It tends to work better if I take some down time long before I am feeling this way, although I feel challenged to stop the flow of a glorious day...<br/>\nToday was one of those days: We woke up together, did our casual morning routine; my younger daughter decided to do some math problems; we dropped off my younger one at another family&#39;s house for a cupcake-baking day in preparation for a halloween party coming up at an unschooling co-op we belong to; I went shopping with my older daughter for pj&#39;s; then a stop with both kids to a dollar store for items in preparation for the same halloween party; and finally, a stop at a farm to pick pumpkins for our porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I write this, I will just mention that this sounds like too much for one day. If that is so, I wonder at the advice I might receive around what life looks like if one does not &quot;make it all happen&quot;...and how you would communicate this to your kids if they in fact wish for and ask for all of these wonderful things. I will say that these feel like &quot;pressing matters&quot; to my kids: all preparations are for a halloween function that is happening this Thursday...pj shopping is in response to a need that has existed for a few weeks, etc. I secretly admit to a feeling of always trying to &quot;keep up&quot; with all of the wonderful ideas and suggestions of my children!<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, does it feel vulnerable to post this!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63551,"nextTopicId":63412}}
