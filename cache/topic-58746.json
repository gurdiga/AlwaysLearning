Because taking the things back that day if they were ill-gotten, would have worked better than the mom discovering later (if they were ill-gotten) that they were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-In the meantime, I decide that Zibby will get an allowance of 10 a <br/>\nweek and that I will keep it in my purse in her wallet, but she can <br/>\nspend it on what she wants.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you keeping it?  Can&#39;t there be a place in the house, in her room, where she can keep it and keep an eye on it, get it out, count it...   And she might like ones more than a ten.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- The shoe store. I ask, like you found it there? It was someones <br/>\ntoy? no, she says, it was in a big basket. So, I say, ok, so you stole <br/>\na toy from the store? why didnt you ask me if you could have it or use <br/>\nyour own money? she says she didnt think.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you got really angry.  She&#39;s probably afraid to tell the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-At this point I have a talk with her <br/>\nabout stealing and the trouble you could get in and maybe that I would <br/>\nget in, and how people think about people who take things, and she <br/>\njust keeps saying she doesnt know what she is thinking. I dont want to <br/>\nshame her or be too hard, yet this is unacceptable!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does sound rough, though.   She&#39;s not another adult.  She probably really DOESN&#39;T know what she&#39;s thinking.  I don&#39;t always know what I&#39;m thinking, and I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Later the same week I pick her up from a playdate at her friends (the <br/>\nsame one as before) and I pick up her backpack to carry for her, and <br/>\nit is really heavy. I say, man! whats in here? ...but eventually she admits that <br/>\nshe had been trying to take her friends stuff.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAh... <br/>\nDid you talk to the other mom that time?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I tell her how friends wont have her over if she steals from them, how <br/>\nshe will get a reputation for stealing, how I wouldnt let people take <br/>\nour stuff or her stuff-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t use  the term &quot;reputation.&quot;  It&#39;s not &quot;having a reputation for stealing.&quot;  It&#39;s being a thief.<br/>\nThe way you have it worded above, it seems there&#39;s a difference between stealing and other people thinking one has stolen.  Even if no one knew at all, she still isn&#39;t being the best person she could be.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Then there have been a couple of instances of her hiding my ipod and <br/>\nwhen I ask &quot;hey does anyone know where it is&quot; she says no,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could say &quot;I need my iPod, if anyone knows where it is.&quot;<br/>\nThen producing it would be sweet!  It wouldn&#39;t set her up to lie.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\nIm at a complete loss.<br/>\nI need to know what is an appropriate response from me to her and how <br/>\ndo I handle returning all this stuff, how to prevent more theft, what <br/>\nelse to say to my daughter, myself....-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take a photo of the things, if you find another stash like the backpack full of jewelry.  Not in a mean way, just a casual photo.  Keep them somewhere so that you can use them when you&#39;re talking about the problem in the future.  Maybe photograph the fringe dress.  Someday she might be ashamed of the whole thing and you could throw the photos away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could pack the dress up and put a letter with it and deliver it to the other family.  That would keep you from having to be right there for the reaction and the follow-up.  It would give them a chance to process the news in their own way.   I think it should be a letter from you, not from your daughter.  She&#39;s too young, in my opinion, to understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another reason I think it should be from you is that the first time you suspected your daughter had a backpack full of things that did NOT come from the dollar store, you didn&#39;t do anything.  You &quot;accepted that,&quot; you said.  You were somewhat complicit, then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she shouldn&#39;t be carrying a backpack.  Maybe a clear purse would help for a while--not in an accusatory way, but so that she could leave in good conscience, knowing others could see what was in her purse, and they wouldn&#39;t be tempted to ask her to open her backpack before she left, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say &quot;you will get a reputation for stealing,&quot; though.  I would say &quot;I don&#39;t want you to be a person who doesn&#39;t care about other people.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182207143,"authorName":"Nancy Machaj","from":"Nancy Machaj &lt;nmachaj@...&gt;","profile":"nmachaj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"almost 7 year old taking stuff that doesnt belong to her","postDate":"1294181202","msgId":58746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNkYxREQ2LTYxMTAtNEFBNC05MjEwLTYwQ0IxMzlENUY2MEBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58749,"prevInTime":58745,"nextInTime":58747,"topicId":58746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, I am writing about my almost 7 year old daughter (birthday Feb16) . She has never been to school, we have always intended to unschool, and Ive been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-412244899\">Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing about my almost 7 year old daughter (birthday Feb16) .  <br/>\nShe has never been to school, we have always intended to unschool, and  <br/>\nIve been reading this list for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the issue: lately she has been taking things that dont belong  <br/>\nto her. Here is how it progressed..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first instance that I was aware of, unfolded in a stressful  <br/>\nsituation. We were leaving the house and all of a sudden, my daughter  <br/>\nstarted freaking out about her clothes itching her (not a terribly  <br/>\nuncommon situation) and took them all off and was crying and having a  <br/>\nhard time finding a new outfit. Myself and my son were standing in our  <br/>\ncoats and carrying our bags and stuff at the door while this unfolds.  <br/>\nI get frustrated with her screaming and slamming stuff aroudn in the  <br/>\nother room  and now we are going to be late to wherever we were headed  <br/>\n(dont remember now) at any rate, any assistance I offer or suggestions  <br/>\nI make about clothes get shot down and she is screaming and crying etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe finally makes it in the foyer, dressed, but with 3 large bags of  <br/>\nthings she wants to take with her, I tell her to please combine to two  <br/>\nbags so that she can carry them, so she dumps them out on the floor  <br/>\nand I see a ten dollar bill. I ask her where it had come from, because  <br/>\nI was missing money from my wallet, but I had assumed my husband had  <br/>\nneeded it and taken it. she sort of hems and haws and I ask her if she  <br/>\ntook it from my wallet. She finally says yes. She said that when the  <br/>\nTooth Fairy came the week before and only left her 5 dollars (after  <br/>\nhaving left her 10 for the first tooth a few months ago) and it wasnt  <br/>\nenough so she had to take my money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really made me flip out. Obviously she doesnt know that Im the  <br/>\ntooth fairy so she has no idea that Im now taking this personally, but  <br/>\nit just made me so freaking angry. Even at the time I realized that Im  <br/>\nprobably over reacting because of the thoughts Im having about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go downstairs get in the car and after I have calmed down somewhat,  <br/>\nI ask her what did she need to take money from my wallet for, and she  <br/>\nsays &quot;makeup&quot; and I almost imploded. We had, two days earlier, gone to  <br/>\nthe store and spent 30$ on a sparkly pink three level beauty case FULL  <br/>\nof makeup which is in addition to the 2 makeup cases that she already  <br/>\nhas full of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far regarding all this makeup/nail polish/hair stuff, we have  <br/>\ngotten her ALOT of stuff and almost always pick up an item for her  <br/>\nwhen we shop, etc, so I am pretty surprised  that she is feeling lack  <br/>\nabout this, but clearly she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nat any rate, nothing else happened for a couple months. that i know of.<br/>\nThen she comes home from a friends house with a LOT of new stuff.  <br/>\nMakeup, bath stuff, bracelets...She told me that the other mom took  <br/>\nthem to the dollar store. I didnt really look over the stuff too much,  <br/>\nand the mom had bought her stuff before (although maybe not, actually)  <br/>\nso I accepted that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I decide that Zibby will get an allowance of 10 a  <br/>\nweek and that I will keep it in my purse in her wallet, but she can  <br/>\nspend it on what she wants. She sometimes chooses to buy stuff and  <br/>\nsoemtimes says she wants to save it up and forgo the wanted item.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext thing, we go shoe shopping at a busy store where they get  <br/>\ncommision on sales. I got a pair of boots. Zibby wanted to try on  <br/>\nshoes, but I told her that since we werent planning to buy any for her  <br/>\ntoday, and since it was busy, it wasnt fair to the workers or other  <br/>\npeople to just try on shoes for fun. She was unhappy, but i paid and  <br/>\nwe left. The next day she and henry are fighting over a toy and I ask  <br/>\nwhat it is. Its al little frog flashlight. I ask her where it came  <br/>\nfrom. The shoe store. I ask, like you found it there? It was someones  <br/>\ntoy? no, she says, it was in a big basket. So, I say, ok, so you stole  <br/>\na toy from the store? why didnt you ask me if you could have it or use  <br/>\nyour own money? she says she didnt think.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night I find another one in her bedroom as we are getting  <br/>\nit ready for houseguests. So she had taken two of them. I ask her if  <br/>\nthere are any more? she says no. I tell her she needs to come clean  <br/>\nand tell the whole truth and she says no, there is only two. I found  <br/>\nthe third one later that night. At this point I have a talk with her  <br/>\nabout stealing and the trouble you could get in and maybe that I would  <br/>\nget in, and how people think about people who take things, and she  <br/>\njust keeps saying she doesnt know what she is thinking. I dont want to  <br/>\nshame her or be too hard, yet this is unacceptable!<br/>\n<br/>\nLater the same week I pick her up from a playdate at her friends (the  <br/>\nsame one as before) and I pick up her backpack to carry for her, and  <br/>\nit is really heavy. I say, man! whats in here? and zibby immediately  <br/>\ngets cagey, so I open it, and as I do she pulls me aroudn the corner  <br/>\nin the room so her friend cant see us, and she grabs a bunch of stuff  <br/>\nfrom the bag and dumps it on the floor. Its packages of bath stuff and  <br/>\nlotions.  We leave, and when we get in the car, I ask her what that  <br/>\nwas all about. She doesnt want to talk but eventually she admits that  <br/>\nshe had been trying to take her friends stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell her how friends wont have her over if she steals from them, how  <br/>\nshe will get a reputation for stealing, how I wouldnt let people take  <br/>\nour stuff or her stuff, etc and she basically keeps sayhing she doenst  <br/>\nknow why she does it and she &quot;doesnt think&quot; So I ask her what I can do  <br/>\nto help her stop and how Im going to need to check her bags and  <br/>\npockets when we go places and she says thats good and that will help  <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there have been a couple of instances of her hiding my ipod and  <br/>\nwhen I ask &quot;hey does anyone know where it is&quot; she says no, but later  <br/>\nwill produce it. I dont get it because everyone shares it and its not  <br/>\na big deal for her to have had it. I dont get why she lies and says  <br/>\nshe doesnt know.<br/>\n<br/>\nthen last night I need a package of markers that i had bought for a  <br/>\nmeeting I was going to last night. I say, hey, has anyone seen these  <br/>\nmarkers? they were right here&quot; zibby says oh yeah, I think I took  <br/>\nthem, but I cant remember where they are...so I go into her room and  <br/>\nwe start looking. we come across a backpack and she clearly doenst  <br/>\nwant me to open it. so we take it and open it, and omg.<br/>\n<br/>\nits completely full of my perfume, my jewelry, my moms jewelry that I  <br/>\nhad put away in a closet cabinet way up high, wads of jewelry and  <br/>\ncheap makeup that i now realize she has probably taken from her friend  <br/>\nand NOT got at the dollar store, (confirmed by zibby) there is candy  <br/>\nbars that I bought a while ago that she said she ate,  there is  <br/>\nanother ten dollar bill, there is bottles of homeopathic tablets that  <br/>\nshe found in the medicine cabinet..just full of STUFF. she keeps  <br/>\nsaying, this is all from the PAST mom, I DID IT BEFORE, and IM like,  <br/>\nbefore what?<br/>\n<br/>\nwe eventually find the markers stashed under her beauty table. I dont  <br/>\neven know what to say about all this to her. While we are going thru  <br/>\nthe stuff and Im putting my jewelry etc away, I notice this purple  <br/>\nfringe dress on my bed with some other of zibbys clothes. Where did  <br/>\nthis come from? I ask her. she says she took it from her friend fran  <br/>\nat frans brithday party last week. Im flabbergasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm at a complete loss.<br/>\nI need to know what is an appropriate response from me to her and how  <br/>\ndo I handle returning all this stuff, how to prevent more theft, what  <br/>\nelse to say to my daughter, myself....<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in Chicago<br/>\nzibby almost 7<br/>\nhenry 3.5</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58771,"nextTopicId":58786}}
