You can set up planned activities so they aren&#39;t school <br/>\nlike. Parents can pick a theme (with kids&#39; input and interests in mind). <br/>\nFor example, you can have &quot;music day.&quot; Each family puts together some <br/>\nkind of &quot;music day&quot; activity. Maybe they bring some interesting musical <br/>\ninstruments and the kids try them out. Maybe they bring a &quot;science&quot; <br/>\nactivity - it is fun to bring lots of things to bang on like drums <br/>\n(oatmeal boxes, pot lids, etc.) and put rice on them so you can actually <br/>\nsee the vibrations), maybe someone teaches everyone to sing a round <br/>\ntogether. We&#39;ve done music day, dice day, lego day, take-apart day, <br/>\nairplanes day, international day, &quot;sun&quot; day, archaeology day, colonial <br/>\namerica day, westward movement day, rhyming day, mud day, games day, old <br/>\nphotos day, candlemaking, balloon day, soldering day, origami day, rock <br/>\nday, erosion day, science experiments you can eat day, light day, puzzle <br/>\nday, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids were not required to participate - some kids always just played in <br/>\nthe park the entire time. Some kids did every activity offered. Mostly <br/>\nthey were not group activities, but each parent would set up a station <br/>\nand kids would go around and do whatever interested them. We did these <br/>\nat parks. Also had holiday celebrations and once a month science day and <br/>\nevery other week a sports day and the kids put on plays together and we <br/>\nwent on tours together and went camping together, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about 6 or 7 years of that - my kids wanted a lot more free play, <br/>\nfewer elaborate planned activities. So we started another group and the <br/>\ngoal of the group as stated was to protect their free play time. We did <br/>\nalso offer an occasional activity - but it would be just one or two <br/>\nactivities on a day rather than the 10 or sometimes even more that our <br/>\nold group would have in one day. Take-apart day - everyone brought lots <br/>\nof tools and old broken appliances. Candle making, origami, bubbles, <br/>\nbottle rockets, rope-making, etc. Lower key than our previous group.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth groups are still going - some people go to both, some to just one <br/>\nor the other, depending on what their kids like. My now-18 year old <br/>\nstill goes most weeks and plays games with her buddies. She started when <br/>\nshe was 4 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a really social kid - this is something you can do. They <br/>\nwon&#39;t want to go to school if it means missing out on that much fun with <br/>\nfriends. It is a lot of work, but also really a lot of fun. I know <br/>\nsomeone who puts on activities like this in her back yard on a regular <br/>\nbasis. She charges a little for it - makes a little money on it. She <br/>\ndoes all the work and so can offer stuff her own kids really enjoy. <br/>\nBuilt-in  social life for her kids, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be clear these are very much NOT school-type activities. They <br/>\nare hands-on fun things to do. At &quot;colonial day&quot; for example, one person <br/>\nbrought clay and the kids made clay marbles and learned to play marble <br/>\ngames from back then. Someone brought big washtubs and washboards with <br/>\nlots of doll clothes and some kids spent the day scrubbing clothes and <br/>\nhanging them up to dry.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"Verna","from":"&quot;Verna&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Four year old who LOVES school","postDate":"1241742114","msgId":44747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0dnR2MitoZW50QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0dnRiYytrNzRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44746,"nextInTopic":44748,"prevInTime":44746,"nextInTime":44748,"topicId":44741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

School does<br/>\nchanges as kids grow older. She&#39;s going to the same place, likely with some<br/>\nof the same kids. That can go on for years actually! Other kids will<br/>\neventually be doing &quot;after school&quot; activities while that is your child&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; but it doesn&#39;t matter what you call it if she enjoys it and gets<br/>\nher social needs met.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is almost 5 and has taken classes at our local parks and rec center<br/>\nsince he was 1 or 2 (these are wonderful classes in all sorts of things:<br/>\nmostly sports and arts). For the younger kids the classes are only 30-45<br/>\nmins and super cheap (like $12 for 4 classes). As they get older they move<br/>\nto 45-60 min classes (and the price goes up to a whopping $18-20 for 4<br/>\nclasses). We did a lot the year he was 3 because he expressed a lot of<br/>\ninterest in sports, so he did soccer, baseball, gymnastics, etc. and he<br/>\nloved going and doing the classes. Incidentally, we are not doing any<br/>\nclasses right now because he doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, which I am a<br/>\nlittle sad about but that is a whole other story. (I am honoring his need to<br/>\nstay home even though I feel he needs to get out more and be around other<br/>\nkids, but we have play dates with our local unschooling group sometimes that<br/>\nseems to satisfy his current group social needs. I guess in due time he may<br/>\nwant to take classes again. We just got the summer class catalog and I will<br/>\nask him if he&#39;d like to take any classes.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I had a good laugh one day when he was 3 and when we went to the<br/>\nplayground park that is right next to the rec center where he took classes<br/>\nand he pointed and said, &quot;There&#39;s my school!&quot; So after that when he had a<br/>\nclass there, we were going to school. Most of the sports classes were taught<br/>\nby a wonderful teacher named Michelle who seemed knowledgeable in all sports<br/>\nand had an incredible amount of patience with small children. She even had<br/>\nher own teenage children help her with the classes sometimes (as they&#39;d<br/>\nbreak the kids into smaller groups). Her oldest college age son is now<br/>\nteaching some classes on his own! We really lucked out in finding such a<br/>\ngreat teacher and having a cheap parks and rec dept close by.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had always intended to homeschool and had wondered what it would be like<br/>\nif my son ever asked to go to school, and that curiousity was satisfied by<br/>\nfinding out that he was going to &quot;school&quot; with his &quot;teacher&quot; Michelle! I<br/>\nthink I miss the classes more than he does! But they also satisfied family<br/>\nmembers (daddy included) ideas that Damon needs to be around kids his own<br/>\nage more. I&#39;ve been getting more questions about when he&#39;s starting classes<br/>\nagain. **sigh**<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId\">http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId</a><br/>\n=44741/stime=1241717119/nc1=1/nc2=2/nc3=3&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"katherand@gmail.com","from":"katherand@...","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Four year old who LOVES school","postDate":"1241721235","msgId":44743,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIzNjk2NmZjMzRiNzBkNzhjMDQ0NTAyY2UzYTdiNjMyQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0djRwNyttZHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd0djRwNyttZHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44741,"nextInTopic":44744,"prevInTime":44742,"nextInTime":44744,"topicId":44741,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... gone two mornings a week to a nursery school at the YMCA.

Her only sibling at this point just turned one, so there&#39;s not that kind of kid play opportunity at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always wanted to do some form of homeschooling/unschooling with her.  I discovered the concept of radical unschooling in November and am definitely drawn in that direction and have begun to move slowly in that direction at home.  (I ws never really rule oriented to begin with.)  Now, however, my daughter wants to go to preschool like the other children will do next year.  Of course, she doesn&#39;t have a real conception of preschool, other than that is where other children will be and perhaps that it will have that school structure to it. Perhaps that is part of what she likes.  I don&#39;t know for sure.  I just know she LOVES going to the YMCA nursery school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have told her we are going to do something different at home.  I have plans to enroll her in swimming and gymnastics at the YMCA to give her some of that social dynamic she seems to crave and gather with friends often.  (By the way, I know of no other people in my rather rural locale who would call what they are doing unschooling.  I know lots of school-at-homers, mainly from a Christian mindset.) Part of me regrets sending her to the YMCA nursery school, but how can I regret something that has given her so much joy?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am having my doubts about keeping her home.  If the point of unschooling is to follow their interests, shouldn&#39;t I allow her the joy she gets from going to school?  I have read the section on school choice on Sandra&#39;s website, but I feel like she is so young and that she will never not want to go (at least during the fun preschool year next year) and therefore I will loose her to the school model.  I feel like it will be years before she ever asks to stay home, if she ever does.  This really makes me sad, but I don&#39;t want to keep her home just because that is what I want.  I want her to want it to, but she is so young, I almost feel like she doesn&#39;t really know the alternatives yet.  However, isn&#39;t the unschooling philosophy to let them discover it for themselves and not make these decisions for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for any thoughts/ideas/words of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nelizabeth in NY state</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44710,"nextTopicId":44804}}
