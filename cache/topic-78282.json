But still, no<br/>\nmatter what else the parents believe or deny, the tone and mood they set<br/>\nmake a difference, for good or ill.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chapter on adolescence especially stuck with me. I found hope in the<br/>\nidea that the slow development of the prefrontal cortex in young people was<br/>\npossibly a way to not saddle us primarily with our genetics. I wanted to be <br/>\nable to feel slightly less guilt for<br/>\nhaving passed on faulty genes. If development of the prefrontal cortex is<br/>\nshaped by environment and experience, then what parents do, or don&#39;t do,<br/>\nmakes a difference. How you talk to, and about your child. How you talk to, <br/>\nand about others. The choices you make to be honest, calm, rational, <br/>\nreliable. All of that matters to the brain development of your child, and <br/>\nhow that child will live in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It’s harder, I think, living in high-tech surroundings.  Flush toilets <br/>\nare great, but the house isn’t as likely to break if there’s an outhouse.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was born we were living in a cabin with no plumbing. When the <br/>\npower went out for other people around us, as it often did in winter, <br/>\nnothing about our lives changed. We still brought our water in from <br/>\nelsewhere, we still had wood heat, we still had an outhouse.  We were used <br/>\nto life that way. Our biggest challenge during a heavy snow wasn&#39;t the power <br/>\noutages, but moose on the path to the outhouse. They were sometimes not that <br/>\nenthusiastic about stepping out of our shoveled trail, back into the deep <br/>\nsnow. I could easily live that way again. If our son was *exactly* like me <br/>\nhe might not have hated that life if we had stayed. But, we left when he was <br/>\na baby, and it turned out that he&#39;s not exactly like me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are problems when things go wrong, whether your flush toilet breaks, <br/>\nor your outhouse roof gives way under the weight of snow. :) One hardship <br/>\nmight be in the expectation that everything will work the way it should, and <br/>\nbeing caught off guard when it doesn&#39;t. Your TV probably will quit working <br/>\none day. A water pipe might break. Your computer could crash. The more <br/>\nyou&#39;re aware of how good things are when they are good, the easier it will <br/>\nbe to wade through the times when things are less good. If you&#39;re aware of <br/>\nhow lucky you are, everyday problems by comparison can seem smaller, and <br/>\nmore manageable. And being that kind of parent who can cope well in a <br/>\ncrisis, is good for your kids, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New writing about parents as light","postDate":"1506355495","msgId":78283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3MzJCNzU2LUFENzctNEIzOC05NjY4LURFNEQ3N0FBODEzMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0NDcyMUY5LTVEOUMtNDYyRS05RjMwLTkxQUQ3NzA5RUJBREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWExMTQ4OGQ2Y2E2ZDYzMzA1NTlmZWNkNTBAZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4gPDA0NDcyMUY5LTVEOUMtNDYyRS05RjMwLTkxQUQ3NzA5RUJBREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78282,"nextInTopic":78285,"prevInTime":78282,"nextInTime":78284,"topicId":78282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I’m reading Behave by Robert Sapolsky, about what is natural for humans, biochemically, genetically, evolutionarily and psychologically. :-) I’m listening","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><html><head></head>I’m reading <i class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">Behave</i>&nbsp;by Robert Sapolsky, about what is natural for humans, biochemically, genetically, evolutionarily and psychologically. :-)<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">I’m listening to it, and and going to the paper copy to mark some good parts. &nbsp;Someday I might make a report, for this group, because I was asking months back for people to help me think about what is instinctive, and this book has lots of answers to that, and interesting studies.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">So parents DO affect their children, lots of ways, clearly. &nbsp;And some parents aren’t doing their biological duty, sometimes, and sometimes when they ARE, the kids balk, or their friends criticize them and say not to listen to their instincts.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">It’s not so simple and straightforward as any one educational or parenting or political theory would like people to believe. &nbsp;But still, no matter what else the parents believe or deny, the tone and mood they set make a difference, for good or ill.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">It’s harder, I think, living in high-tech surroundings. &nbsp;Flush toilets are great, but the house isn’t as likely to break if there’s an outhouse.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">And that can be a representative sample of info to think about. :-)</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">Thanks again for reading here, and though it seems off topic sometimes, it will come back to peace, joy, learning, and parenting as directly and as sweetly as possible. :-)</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2088659928\">Sandra</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New writing about parents as light","postDate":"1506351612","msgId":78282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0NDcyMUY5LTVEOUMtNDYyRS05RjMwLTkxQUQ3NzA5RUJBREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWExMTQ4OGQ2Y2E2ZDYzMzA1NTlmZWNkNTBAZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78283,"prevInTime":78281,"nextInTime":78283,"topicId":78282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last night I needed a Just Add Light and Stir, and I wanted to go to sleep.
