I went to look for it, but it wasn&#39;t there.? She was sure that&#39;s where it was, so she came in to prove it.? She walks right up to the dresser, counts with her finger from the bottom of the dresser, 1, 2, 3, and opens the drawer, and voila, there&#39;s the belt.? I laughed, and said, 1, 2, 3, from the bottom?? Like a building?? And she smiled and said, yeah, why not?? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me think about other examples of how we (&quot;we&quot; - our society/schools, not &quot;we&quot; - us here) define things as &#39;the right way&#39; and &#39;the wrong way,&#39; instead of the &#39;standard&#39; or &#39;traditional&#39; way, when there is often more than one way of thinking that makes sense, and by not recognizing that, we have the potential to damage our kids&#39; ability to think clearly, because they don&#39;t trust their own minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was John Holt who used an example of this in one of his books when discussing helping learn kids to read, and points out that a chair is still a chair if you turn it around backwards or upside down, but if you do the same thing to the letter &#39;b,&#39; it becomes something completely different, and if we treat that as something that just &#39;makes sense,&#39; kids may conclude that their own common sense is faulty and just resort to taking other people&#39;s word for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvented spelling is another one.? And the thing about right and left -- if I&#39;m looking at a pair of pants, isn&#39;t the right pants&#39; pocket the one one *my* right?? Does it change if someone is wearing them?? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all of this is not to say there&#39;s no benefit to using agreed-upon standard definitions and rules for things.? You might actually want someone to be able to get you your belt.? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Patty<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.? I&#39;m sorry if random question marks appear throughout my post.?
