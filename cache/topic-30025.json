I had told Keith he  <br/>\ncould take my van to work, when we were going to leave his at the  <br/>\nshop.  When we were in the driveway to leave, he said &quot;Martin didn&#39;t  <br/>\ncome home,&quot; and I figured he was out late and slept on someone&#39;s  <br/>\ncouch, but luckily I remembered before Keith left.  So he left me my  <br/>\nratty old mini-van which makes whale songs and should be in the shop  <br/>\nitself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to be older and have extra cars.  Many times I had to drive  <br/>\nKeith to work in our one vehicle (or our one running vehicle) and  <br/>\npick him up later.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty&#39;s housesitting for five days.  He can come home during the day  <br/>\nto get stuff, but he&#39;s sleeping there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason we put the Taurus in the shop is that Holly and I are  <br/>\ngoing to Denver for the weekend.  I should be able to update the  <br/>\nlyrics game from there (in case Marji just gasped...); the photos are  <br/>\nin Photobucket so I can get to them from there.  It will be Holly and  <br/>\none or two older male friends (older than Holly,  younger than I am;  <br/>\none&#39;s 22, one&#39;s 36) who can help us drive if they go, and participate  <br/>\nin the SCA philosophy discussion while we&#39;re there.  The one who  <br/>\ndraws is VERY interested in going, The other is fairly newlywed (less  <br/>\nthan a year) and works long hours, mostly driving, so driving to  <br/>\nDenver for fun isn&#39;t as much a draw for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be staying with Wendy, who used to live with us.  They live  <br/>\nacross from a little lake/pond with ducks and geese, so I&#39;ll take  <br/>\nsome corn I have from when we made cornbags.  (Will ducks and geese  <br/>\neat corn?  I&#39;d rather not give them bread; it&#39;s not natural...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the considerations of the moment at my house.  Kirby&#39;s  <br/>\nasleep; worked until 3:00 a.m.  Holly&#39;s asleep; don&#39;t know what she  <br/>\ndid after I went to sleep.  I&#39;m repairing two pairs of Marty&#39;s  <br/>\nfavorite pants today.  I really like days when I can stretch and not  <br/>\nbe pressured.  I know those of you with little kids don&#39;t have that  <br/>\nright now, but you will!  You will.  (I didn&#39;t then, and I do now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29990,"nextTopicId":29826}}
