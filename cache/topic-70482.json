He has never attended school and has 3 younger sisters that have also never attended school. When he was 4 a counselor told us that he had Asperger&#39;s. My concern lies with his reading. He can read some words and says that he wants to read, but gets upset and frustrated when trying and just says&quot; I can&#39;t read, the words are too long&quot;  Then he shuts down.  <br/>\nI realized early on that typical &quot;teaching methods&quot; were not for him and that is what brought me to seek out unschooling. I read stories to him and assist with reading things when he is playing video games or any other time he asks. My main question is...is there time when I should worry that he hasn&#39;t cracked the code yet. I am at a loss of what to do to help him further. His 7 yr old sister started reading at 4 and is an avid reader, and he doesn&#39;t understand why he is not.  I try to explain to him that everyone does things in their own time but that has not helped him. <br/>\nHow can I help him? <br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70465,"nextTopicId":70481}}
