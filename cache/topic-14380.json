I&#39;ve made a list of what I used to make <br/>\nours:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)Printmaster.com sells their series of art and craft programs.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen using Printmaster for years for everything and promise you won&#39;t <br/>\nregret buying it.  Their newest is what you need to get...Printmaster <br/>\nPlatinum 15 DVD.  It&#39;s online for $39.99.  If you try to buy it in a <br/>\nstore you&#39;ll get stuck with about 8 CD-Roms...ugh!  Go online and order <br/>\nthe DVD where everything is on one.  On the program are period rooms you <br/>\ncan print out on full sheets and just line them up on your frig or <br/>\nfreezer for the house rooms.  They also have hundreds of animals, toys, <br/>\nfood, etc...your imagination&#39;s the limit for the magnetic house.  We <br/>\neven had a secret garden on our frig with Pegasus and a baby lamb.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) MisterInkJet.com - go to specialty paper and they have reasonable <br/>\npackages of magnetic paper.  They also sell T-shirt transfer paper, <br/>\ncanvas paper, shrink-a-dink paper, vinyl cling paper, and fuzzy paper. <br/>\n They have lots more, too, but these are some of the really fun ones. <br/>\n If you order over a certain total price, shipping is free.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  I printed our dolls and their clothes from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paperdolls.com/pages/pdgallry.htm#top\">http://www.paperdolls.com/pages/pdgallry.htm#top</a><br/>\nTheir dolls are very artistic, beautiful and literary.  They have dolls <br/>\nfrom classic novels like Little Women, Vanity Fair, Wuthering Heights, <br/>\nMansfield Park, Sense & Sensibility, Great Expectations.  There is also <br/>\nfamous old-time movie stars and celebrities.  There are great boyish <br/>\npaper dolls like Alexander the Great, Hadrian, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, <br/>\nKing David, Michaelangelo, and Shakespeare.  Anyway, check them out. <br/>\n They really are gorgeous and fun.  And if you have a scanner or know <br/>\nsomeone who does, shink your kids down so they can dress themselves with <br/>\nall the cool period clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and have fun.  We&#39;ve been enjoying ours for over 6 months and <br/>\nthey still love it.  Nobody in the house can resist messing with them <br/>\nwhen we walk by the frig.  It&#39;s especially amusing to put the ladies <br/>\nclothes on the men and vice versa.  Example: Alexander the Great&#39;s arms <br/>\nare attached to his clothes, so when you put his clothes on, say, Amy of <br/>\nLittle Women, you get a beautiful young girl with HUGE biceps. We&#39;ve <br/>\nalso been added seasonal additions and holiday stuff, like a Christmas tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day everyone!

We have<br/>\n&gt; elaborate<br/>\n&gt; rooms (full sheets) on the frig with paper dolls and their clothes.  I<br/>\n&gt; got the dolls off a website.****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you so much for this idea. My kids and I love paper dolls, but<br/>\n&gt; they rip so easily.  I had the magnetic David and Venus on the fridge<br/>\n&gt; for a long time,  but the kids loved them to death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just ordered printable magnetic sheets from Staples and found a bunch<br/>\n&gt; of free paper doll (including some boy dolls) sites to download!  We are<br/>\n&gt; going to have a blast with these.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, thanks to the person who gave directions for goop (or whatever it<br/>\n&gt; was called - was that here or the other group?), my kids and I have been<br/>\n&gt; having fun with it too.  A little gross for me, but they are loving it -<br/>\n&gt; so much so that we have run out of food coloring.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just found out today that there has been enough rain here to fill up<br/>\n&gt; my favorite swimming hole!  Yea!  So we&#39;ll be spending time out there<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; this summer.  The beach, the swimming hole - who needs a pool?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kate<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
