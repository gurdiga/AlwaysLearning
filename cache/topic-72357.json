Any of those things can put a kink in your plans if you&#39;re trying to fit her needs in around your work - that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to be really solid about your priorities, so when what you imagine your life will be doesn&#39;t match up to the reality of your child&#39;s needs, you know where to put your energy.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;\">---Meredith</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283841567,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;braff16@...&gt;","profile":"brynraff","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Do I have to stay at home to unschool?","postDate":"1383829130","msgId":72517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw1ZzJxYSt2cG12ZjVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzNjQ4NzQ5LUI2MTgtNEU4Ny05MDg1LTI2QTI0QkUxQUIxQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQjgxNzhWS3UtWD1YQ29PVUZpOWZmZkc2UjYzTUJkcEFHSmE0cXQwWTV6RkFyNTZaQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDUzNjQ4NzQ5LUI2MTgtNEU4Ny05MDg1LTI2QTI0QkUxQUIxQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72508,"nextInTopic":72537,"prevInTime":72516,"nextInTime":72518,"topicId":72357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=- The reasoning for me is not that I don t like the idea of spending almost all of my time with my daughter, -=- ...

We don&#39;t yet know which country we&#39;re likely to end up in or for exactly how long, but the chances of a PhD at all are fairly high. So keeping my eye out for flexible, can-travel kind of work now is my way of building up links and connections with people and work places that I can draw on when we move.

Generally speaking, little kids need more direct attention than they will when they&#39;re older - if your little one isn&#39;t all that mobile yet, this may still be very theoretical for you ;) but toddlers, in particular, can take up a whole lot of time and attention because they&#39;re hugely interested in everything, can get to a lot of things, but still don&#39;t have the awareness to keep themselves safe. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean staying home all the time - some kids like to be out and about, especially as toddlers, but others find outings stressful even when they&#39;re enjoyable.

As a result I have found it super easy to lie down with her for 1-3 hours while she naps without feeling like I wanted/needed to get up to do something. When I have time, I sometimes read a good book, but most of the time naps are a great chance to get some reading and/or work done while cuddling a beautiful sleeping bub :-) (I don&#39;t imagine it will work quite the same if/when number two comes along, but has been wonderful with our first!)

I talked to my mother who works full-time. We discussed getting a place together so that we could both help each other out. My aunt & uncle had a rental home that the renters were moving out of. It was perfect timing. My mom, my son, my youngest daughter, and I all moved in together. The rent is more than what both of us were paying but since we split the rent and all the utilities, it is cheaper in the long run.

I help with cooking dinner, dishes, laundry, and other cleaning so that my mom doesn&#39;t have to worry about those things. It&#39;s worked out really well for us. I work Mondays from 8am to 5pm, Fridays from 8am to 3pm, and then every other Saturday from 8am to 3pm. So, I&#39;m only gone 2 to 3 days per week. Either my son or my mom are with my youngest daughter while I&#39;m at work depending on their work schedules.

Those days are great because we can still be together even while I&#39;m working. I still have time to spend with her in between my job duties. So, that is how we made it work in the beginning and how we make it work now. It may change again someday but that&#39;s what works for now. Well, my daughter just came in the room so I&#39;m going to go spend time with her which is my favorite thing in the world to do. :-)</font></div>\n</font></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327452883,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;vijendranmarie@...&gt;","profile":"marie_vijendran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: RE: Do I have to stay at home to unschool?","postDate":"1381945100","msgId":72369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwzbWl1Yysxdmo2ZnVnQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGwzam8waCsxMjZpbzZtQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGwzaDVvOCsxNThnYWg0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDM5OTgwRDg5LTJBNzYtNDBGNi1CMDRGLTlBQkFGQjM5OTE2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPGwzam8waCsxMjZpbzZtQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72368,"nextInTopic":72370,"prevInTime":72368,"nextInTime":72370,"topicId":72357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"   What I am asking when I say do I have to stay home is really is it possible to unschool (give your child the attention to unschool) even if I don t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1422701234\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1422701234ygrps-yiv-1912299192\"><p> &gt;&gt;&gt;<span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;\"> What I am asking when I say &quot;do I have to stay home&quot; is really &quot;is it possible to unschool (give your child the attention to unschool) even if I don&#39;t stay at home the whole day?&quot;. </span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;\">As an example of looking at things another way....</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1422701234yui_3_10_3_6_1381946169091_38\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;\">I sometimes stay &#39;at home&#39; whilst my children are out and about with other people.

We&#39;ve done a few different things over the years:<div><br><div>-When our son was born, and until he was six, my partner reduced her hours to four days per week, so she could have more time at home with our son and I could have a work day. </div>\n<div>-I&#39;ve taught at the university most years, and always asked for an evening class, so I could work when my partner was home.</div><div>-I&#39;ve got an awesome mother who currently spends two days a week  with my son. She&#39;s fully in support of unschooling and they have a lovely relationship. I schedule any outside the home work for those two days.</div>\n<div>-I work from home, mostly, as a writer. My hours are very flexible. When my son was younger and needed me to be doing stuff with him all the time, I got up early and wrote before he woke up. Now that he is nine, I can often write while he has a friend over or is deeply absorbed in an activity that doesn&#39;t involve me. </div>\n<div>-When my son was 6 or 7, and I had deadlines or had got myself into a situation where I&#39;d taken on more work than I had time for, I hired a mother&#39;s helper (lovely 12 year old homeschooler) for a couple hours so that my son had someone to play with while I frantically typed away in the corner of the living room. He enjoyed his time with her. Later on we hired a university student one morning a week to do some Minecraft related programming with my son, which he loved, and which gave me some extra time to work. </div>\n<div><br></div><div>Overall, I&#39;d say I&#39;ve mostly worked anywhere from 12- 20 hours a week since he was a toddler, and while there have been stretches in which I could have used a bit more sleep, it&#39;s generally been great. I love having so much time with my son, and unschooling has made all of our lives happier and more relaxed and peaceful. And I love my work, and my son enjoys discussing the books I write and giving me ideas and celebrating at book launches... and I think it&#39;s good that he sees me pursuing a passion and making money doing something I love. </div>\n<div><br></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Do I have to stay at home to unschool?","postDate":"1381882120","msgId":72368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjExMS1XNEJFMkU0QzY3RjhERkRCMUNEMzJBQjcwNDBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEIyODA4QzlDLUI0NDItNEY1QS04QTUyLTQ0QTE0RTNFNjg2Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGwzaDVvOCsxNThnYWg0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4sPEIyODA4QzlDLUI0NDItNEY1QS04QTUyLTQ0QTE0RTNFNjg2Q0B5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72367,"nextInTopic":72369,"prevInTime":72367,"nextInTime":72369,"topicId":72357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been very lucky that i m able to work from home part-time, and am the primary at home parent unschooling our son - I work as a freelance science","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-496810172\"><html>\n<head>\n<style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-496810172 .ygrps-yiv-496810172hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrps-yiv-496810172 .ygrps-yiv-496810172hmmessage\n{\nfont-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;}\n--></style></head>\n<div dir='ltr'><br>I have been very lucky that i&#39;m able to work from home part-time, and am the primary &#39;at home&#39; parent unschooling our son - I work as a freelance science writer and science communicator. &nbsp;My husband works is a post-doc researcher at a Uni, and so that is fairly flexible also - on the odd occasions when I go away for work for a few days, it&#39;s fairly easy for him to stay home.<div><br></div><div>There are plenty of options though, as Pam outlined - i&#39;ve considered working at night to make some extra cash in addition to working from home.

I have two boys, 9 and 11 years old. My husband and I both work jobs that are technically &quot;full time&quot;, &nbsp;although we are able to take extra days off and work shortened shifts regularly. We have worked different shifts over the years. &nbsp;We have always chosen jobs/ shifts that enabled one of us to be home with the kids during the day.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;We are currently both on swing shifts (6pm-2am). My husband is off Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. I am off Wednesday and Thursday, so we only require childcare on Friday and Saturday nights. Because they are older now, they can get up and get breakfast while my husband and I sleep a bit longer. When they were younger, my husband and I worked opposite shifts so that somebody was able to be up early with them in the morning.</div><div><br></div><div>The best part of unschooling has been the sheer time that we are able to spend with our kids! If they were in a traditional school, they would be gone all day, come home, eat and do homework, and I would be leaving for work. Instead, we have all day to play computer and video games, ride bikes, read, hike, build cool stuff, go to park days with the local unschoolers group, meet ups and classes with local homeschool groups, and attend fun events and visit places around our city! Most events and meet ups are during the day.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we have great people that we trust to care for our kids, they are not us. We speak with them extensively about our philosophy, but they don&#39;t have the relationships with our kids that we do and thus handle things differently.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think the key things that make unschooling work in our household with both of us having employment outside the home is:&nbsp;</div><div>1.). Both my husband and I are equally enthusiast, informed, and committed to unschooling.</div><div>2.) &nbsp;We are the primary caregivers for our children and are with them the majority of the time.</div><div><br></div><div>With Appreciation,</div><div><br></div><div>Shelly&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Sent from my iPhone</div><div><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 14, 2013, at 9:22 AM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anacarol.francisco@...\">anacarol.francisco@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote><div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-496810172ecxygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      Hello everybody,<br><br>I am new to the concept of unschooling (started researching about 3 months ago) but so far I&#39;m in love with it.

If anyone doesn&#39;t mind sharing examples of how they fit work around unschooling, I&#39;d love to hear them. Everyday I&#39;m thinking about how important it is to me to unschool my 1-year-old, and right now I&#39;m mostly home with her--experimenting with saying yes more!--and working in the mornings and weekends. But working in my &quot;spare&quot; time has gotten exhausting, and our family is on the cusp of several different options. My husband has a job that almost supports us, but we live in an incredibly expensive area so he is looking at other jobs. I am also looking at jobs as a professor, but with half my heart in it because I only want one of us to be working and I am more excited about the idea of unschooling and staying at home than he is. Still, a huge part of me is afraid of dropping my career in academics, and right now I can tell it&#39;s too hard to maintain these intellectual projects in my &quot;spare&quot; time, especially if I have another kid. I have been reading and searching, and because of all these big changes in our lives it would be really helpful to me to see more examples and hear stories of work and unschooling from experienced parents (when they have time!).</p><p><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Kaitlin<br></p> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1026927155ygroups-quoted\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1026927155ygrps-yiv-1888110677\">On Oct 14, 2013, at 12:22 PM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anacarol.francisco@...\">anacarol.francisco@...</a>&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anacarol.francisco@...\">anacarol.francisco@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I have to stay at home to unschool?<br>\n<br>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m hearing a child say &quot;Do I haaaaave to?&quot; A respectful mom will then ask, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;<br>\n<br>\nWhat do you want to do?<br>\n<br>\nDo you have feelings of unschooling making you stay home?
