Holly and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-487127991\">FOX news is doing a follow-up story on the little article that was in  <br/>\nElle Girl Magazine, and wanted one of the mom/daughter dyads who were  <br/>\nquoted.  Holly and I were asked first and opted out.  Pam and Roya  <br/>\nSorooshian had a house fire a few weeks ago and their lives are too  <br/>\nhectic to even think about it.  Gail Higgins and Brenna McBroom  <br/>\nagreed, or else there would have been no FOX news article.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nIf any of you watch the news anyway and want to record it and maybe  <br/>\nbring us some quotes and a review, that would be cool.  It might be  <br/>\non tonight, or maybe tomorrow night (according to what I was  <br/>\noriginally told) and Gail might know more later today.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet thisâ€”they&#39;re sending a limo:<br/>\nGail wrote: &quot;The interview is today.  They said 2:48 Eastern Time.  I  <br/>\nimagine it will be taped but I forgot to ask.  We&#39;re hoping its fun.   <br/>\nThe Limo driver just called and said he&#39;d be here at 1:30.  I&#39;ll let  <br/>\nyou know how it goes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case any of you want to read the article first to see how they  <br/>\ndeal with the information they already have, it&#39;s here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ellegirl2006april\">http://sandradodd.com/ellegirl2006april</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;ll arrest me for providing a copy while it&#39;s still on the  <br/>\nnewstand (or at all) and if so I hope they send a Limo!  Anyway,  <br/>\nthere are readers on other continents who couldn&#39;t possibly get hold  <br/>\nof ElleGirl, and readers in North America who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead  <br/>\nat the newsstand digging through teen fashion magazines.  Mine came  <br/>\nfree in the mail, so I was spared that bruising indignity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage to Gail and Brenna of doing this is that Brenna has an  <br/>\ninterest in television journalism, so for them it&#39;s a limo ride and  <br/>\nsome experiences inside a news studio.  There&#39;s a risk that the piece  <br/>\nwill make unschooling look stupid.  They have procured an ignorant  <br/>\n&quot;expert&quot; who thinks school is the real world and that unschoolers  <br/>\nwill be know-nothings.  By &quot;ignorant&quot; I mean someone who probably  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t actually KNOW a real unschooler.  It&#39;s like hiring a  <br/>\nbiologist to talk about elephants, even though his field of expertise  <br/>\nis microbiology and invertebrates, ignoring all the elephant wildlife  <br/>\nexperts without degrees.   &quot;Education&quot; might be one monolithic field  <br/>\n(it&#39;s not, I know, but if...) but LEARNING is generally an entirely  <br/>\nseparate thing. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it shows above, but I wasn&#39;t very happy with that magazine  <br/>\narticle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Here&#39;s another serious consideration.  Gail and Brenna are  <br/>\nbeautiful and photogenic.  Holly is photogenic but has a freakish  <br/>\nhaircut, and I&#39;m not photogenic at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been to a recent Live and Learn conference and are not sure  <br/>\nif you remember which people Gail and Brenna are, they&#39;re in photos  <br/>\nhere: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/jenner\">http://sandradodd.com/jenner</a>  leaning against the car, on the  <br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you think Holly&#39;s haircut couldn&#39;t possibly be too weird, it&#39;s  <br/>\nabout 1/3 of an inch longer and quite a more earthly color than it  <br/>\nwas here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/hollyhairjan06\">http://sandradodd.com/hollyhairjan06</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24834,"nextTopicId":24833}}
