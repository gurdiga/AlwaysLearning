Have you had many unauthorized thoughts?<br/>\nWould you like to have many more? Think where no thoughts have gone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning, Yes. Schooling, No Thank You - Luz Shosie and Ned Vare<br/>\nWe&#39;ll talk about how we unlearned years of schooling and trusted our son to<br/>\ndirect his own education. And we&#39;ll answer your questions about how<br/>\nunschooling really works.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Parents Trusted me - Fiona Hutchison<br/>\nMy parents trusted me to live on my own in New York City as young as 13<br/>\nyears old. My &quot;schooling&quot; was extremely limited and relatively ignored (my<br/>\nfather used to say, &quot;F is for fantastic, my dear!&quot;), but my &quot;education&quot; was<br/>\nrich and colorful and intense. I will give a brief account of my unschooling<br/>\nlife and then be happy to answer any questions you may have about a teen on<br/>\nher own. I certainly don&#39;t have all the answers to how unschooling works,<br/>\nbut I can tell you what worked for me when I was given the freedom to pursue<br/>\nmy dreams<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling as Mindful Living - Anne Ohman<br/>\nAs an educational choice, unschooling has infinite benefits. Yet unschooling<br/>\ncan also bring so much more into our family&#39;s lives when we allow it to be<br/>\nused on a greater scale - as a path to more mindful living. Come explore<br/>\nMindful Unschooling with Anne Ohman, and we&#39;ll discuss how to not only free<br/>\nand empower your children through unschooling, but also bless your own life<br/>\nin rewarding and enlightening ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling Changes - Lisa Bugg<br/>\nThe old adage, &quot;nothing remains constant but change&quot;, should be the maxim<br/>\nfor all unschoolers. Unschooling demands that we challenge our long held<br/>\nbeliefs about children and education. The changes we move through, while<br/>\nwelcome, are at times very stressful. And then, just when we think we have<br/>\nour educational philosophy pinned down, the children change! Many<br/>\nadolescents have sent their unschooling parents scurrying for support when<br/>\nthey come in and demand A PLAN. Your budding 8 year old, who still wants to<br/>\nbe a firefighter, turns around; and you discover a 17 year old who wants to<br/>\nwork in the matter-antimatter lab over at NASA. Let&#39;s talk about how<br/>\nunschooling changes us, as we move through our ever-changing lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy You Can&#39;t Let Go - Joyce Fetteroll<br/>\nDo you secretly lust after the perfect math program? Do you dog ear all the<br/>\npages in homeschooling catalogs and end up feeling guilty for not doing<br/>\nenough? Do you sometimes envy the school at homers because they have it all<br/>\nplanned out for them? Let&#39;s talk about why packaged learning is so appealing<br/>\nand explore some ways that may help you let go.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFunshops <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvanced Juggling- Ruth Glowacki<br/>\nMore of the same (Beginners Juggling), just a day&#39;s more experience!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt The Movies - Ben Lovejoy<br/>\nSince learning is constant and doesn&#39;t fit neatly into a package nor is it<br/>\nrestricted to any one category, we all use what&#39;s most helpful to improve<br/>\nour understanding of certain things. Using the movie, Dead Poet&#39;s Society,<br/>\nBen Lovejoy explores one of his passions, movies, to help dicuss how the<br/>\ntenets of unschooling resonate throughout this intriguing piece of art.<br/>\nAlthough we will be showing the video on Saturday night, please take the<br/>\ntime to watch the movie before you come to the conference. Look for those<br/>\nparts of the movie which help you understand (or maybe further confuse you)<br/>\nabout unschooling. We intend to discuss those parts and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginners Juggling - Ruth Glowacki<br/>\nLearn the basics of juggling 1, 2, 3 (or more!) balls, clubs, beanbags, or<br/>\nscarves.No experience necessary.

Teach the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; - Nina Smith as Mother Goose<br/>\n&quot;Once upon a time&quot; are magical words that open the doors of imagination and<br/>\nset listeners on a journey into a world of enchantment, mystical encounters,<br/>\nand formidable quests. Fairy tales have been told for hundreds of years and<br/>\nare valued by cultures worldwide. They deal with universal themes and<br/>\nageless wisdom - there is far more to fairy tales than entertainment alone.<br/>\nResearch shows that frequent trips to the land of fairy tales and fantasy<br/>\nhelp children become creative thinkers and problem solvers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay with Your Food! - Alicia Yarbrough<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t play with your food!&quot; Many of us have grown up with that admonition.<br/>\nBut food (especially fruits and vegetables) is quite playful! At one time or<br/>\nanother, we&#39;ve all seen something other than the vegetable itself: a funny<br/>\nface, a cute animal, a monster, a bug. Fruits and vegetables seem to invent<br/>\ntheir own visual puns! Our goal will be to &quot;produce&quot; new images suggested by<br/>\nthe fruits and veggies themselves. We will look to be empowered to<br/>\ncreate---to make art out of food. We will be using some &quot;tools of the<br/>\ntrade&quot;---knives and such, so please be sure that the younger child has an<br/>\nadult by his side. <br/>\n<br/>\nPoetry for Young Writers by Carolina Academy for Educational Excellence -<br/>\nEllen Goldman and Yvonne Dickinson<br/>\nThe presenters will demonstrate an example of their unique style in making<br/>\nthe reading-writing connection work for children.<br/>\nProduct or Service to be Presented: We are Language Arts Consultants<br/>\nproviding alternative educational opportunities for the homeschool<br/>\ncommunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nRainforest Facts and Crafts - Sherry Couch<br/>\nLearn rainforest facts, create a rainstick, snack on a rainforest treat, and<br/>\nlearn the importance of our rainforests and what YOU can do to save them.<br/>\n<br/>\nReluctant Husbands/Reluctant Fathers - Ben Lovejoy<br/>\nBen Lovejoy, recently an unschooling father and husband, facilitates a<br/>\nroundtable discussion about the unique opportunities and challenges which<br/>\nface fathers and husbands in an unschooling home.

Alger<br/>\nParticipants will see how unidentified items from dad&#39;s tool box, or mom&#39;s<br/>\nkitchen...or the contents of that one catch-all drawer that stays full of<br/>\ndead batteries and spent rubber bands can become elegant works of kinetic<br/>\nart! Students will learn that art is actually a balance (pun intended) of<br/>\nscience (in this case, the physical balance) and aesthetics (visual balance)<br/>\nas we suspend say...a cheese grater next to a uh...hand saw so that they<br/>\nbegin a new life as space enhancing &quot;dancers&quot; in perhaps yellow and red.
