It started quite nicely, though <br/>\nfrantically, as my son turned 13, we had his birthday party, and church <br/>\nstarted up for the year (I am Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian <br/>\nUniversalist church), all in the same weekend. (This is not remarkable...it <br/>\nhappens every year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had an ongoing problem with a sick cat, and now it looks like the <br/>\nother cat has the same thing. They&#39;re both elderly, and have thyroid <br/>\nproblems. One of them keeps missing the litter box when she pees, so much of <br/>\nthe time when you go into the bathroom there is cat pee on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a couple days ago my mom, who has been fighting cancer for almost five <br/>\nyears, went into the hospital, as the cancer has spread to her brain. It <br/>\nlooks like it&#39;s very treatable, and that she&#39;ll be okay for now. But she had <br/>\na seizure and the law in FL, where she lives, says she can&#39;t drive until <br/>\nshe&#39;s been seizure-free for six months. She&#39;s also worried she&#39;ll lose her <br/>\njob. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, my father, who left my mom when she got sick, is being totally <br/>\nbizarre and my sister is taking it very personally and is hurting very badly <br/>\nfrom it. (My family was really quite sane and normal up until a few years <br/>\nago.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just overwhelmed. My family (partner and son) are being so wonderful and <br/>\nsupportive, but it&#39;s hard. Last night I screamed at Julian. He was just being <br/>\nsweet-obnoxious-noodgey to Beth, and she asked him to stop several times, but <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t...and I just screamed. He was so startled and his eyes filled with <br/>\ntears. I apologized and he said he knew I was upset.  But...argh!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have another Good Week post, that I will put in another post. Don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to water it down with this stuff. Thanks for listening,<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7527,"nextTopicId":9423}}
