That’s a lotta not learning.  Or it would be, you know, if…<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you can poke around here to see art and stories from other times, and you can subscribe, if you want.  It’s a pretty quiet blog except around this time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com\">http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see a post in there you like, feel free to respond to this with a link or a story or a comment.  It might be best not to start a bunch of new topics about it.  There’s a randomizer there, and a coloring page you could (if you want) color and send back for sharing.  Click the blank and it will open in a new window.  From my Mac, if I tell it to print and then change to landscape, it fills up a full sheet (8.5x11 or A4).  But you could color it electronically, too, if you have the combination of skill and app/program, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com/2016/07/coloring-page.html\">http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com/2016/07/coloring-page.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who wants to do some Learn Nothing Day art for fun, I have a blog to host it on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy e-mail is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> .<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78096,"nextTopicId":78099}}
