Having really considered <br/>\nwhether and how they could concede to a BIG change, conceding to small changes was <br/>\neasy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was just pondering if unschoolers are getting to that crucial mass <br/>\n&gt; (if you believe in it) and how this social movement will affect the <br/>\n&gt; remainder of the society.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was in my teens and twenties during the &quot;Women&#39;s Liberation&quot; days, the beginnings of <br/>\nMs. magazine, the serious social upheavals being created by that.  Some of their greatest <br/>\nresistance came from women who didn&#39;t want the boat rocked.   Part of the boat rocking <br/>\nconsisted simply of one thing:   The clear message that they had a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a person feels she has no choice whatsoever, she finds ways to accept her arranged <br/>\nmarriage, unwished-for pregnancies, mean husband, interference of her parents in her <br/>\nadult life, bottle-feeding babies and leaving them to cry, sending them to school without <br/>\nwondering whether it was good or not.  &quot;No choice.&quot;  That&#39;s just the way it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone not only convincingly says &quot;It could be different,&quot; but PROVES it, the <br/>\ncomfortable cooperative-victimhood (What&#39;s the word for that??) of millions dissolves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy keeping my children home, it is clear to every other family in this cul-de-sac that they <br/>\nhave sent their children to school by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoice is power.  Powerlessness can be comfort, though.  We remove their comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327905838,"authorName":"hollywoodapi","from":"&quot;hollywoodapi&quot; &lt;anna@...&gt;","profile":"hollywoodapi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Microtrends - could unschooling be one of them","postDate":"1201903932","msgId":31912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZvMDVmcytibjQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31943,"prevInTime":31911,"nextInTime":31913,"topicId":31912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear All, Yesterday I was reading an article in a magazine - interview with Mark J.
