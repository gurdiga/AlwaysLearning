What was disturbing was Nate, who is very<br/>\ngifted at figuring things out, was not ready to read.  I saw his self<br/>\nesteem shrink.  I just encouraged him in all activities he was<br/>\ninterested.  In second grade he loathed it but I said as a family we are<br/>\ncommitted to summer.  They put so much pressure on kids to do reading it<br/>\nis serious.  There are some good educators in public schools who really<br/>\ngive, than there are the control freaks who pull rank on everyone<br/>\nincluding  parents.  Unfortunately most are control freaks.  And that<br/>\nwhat happens to kids they loose more and more of control of their lives.<br/>\nSchools are taking over so much of the parenting and family roles, but<br/>\nit is the society who lets it happen to.  The school reflect capitalism<br/>\nand the set up kids who will be successful and who will not, like our<br/>\nsociety.  I got to go.

I liked this article because it relates<br/>\nto my own situation.  We put our oldest son in school after a difficult<br/>\nmove and moving to a town where there is no network of homeschoolers.<br/>\nHe decided to go to school to meet the neighborhood kids and do it on<br/>\nhis own.  He went to school for half of first grade and than completed<br/>\nhis 2nd grade and does not want to go back.  I would keep on encouraging<br/>\nhim to explore his own interests, but I noticed when in school, he did<br/>\nnot have the energy or the brain power to explore what he really likes.<br/>\nAt the end of this school year, I was casual about Homeschooling and did<br/>\nnot cram it down his throat.  I just said try to envision what you would<br/>\nlike with your schooling in the fall.  Within 4 weeks of deprogramming<br/>\nhe wants to homeschool although he doesn&#39;t like the name so we thought<br/>\nup his own name - NATE Natural Achievement Through Education.  I feel<br/>\nconfidence which I lacked when I was Homeschooling before and it showed<br/>\nand he sensed it.  Now he understands the difference.  A couple of<br/>\nmonths ago it was a discussion in this group about a kid who decided to<br/>\ngo to school or not.  It depends on the kid and the parenting.  I have a<br/>\ndaughter who has no desire to go to school and hopefully we will be more<br/>\nestablished in a network for our whole family.  But we will cross that<br/>\nbridge when it comes.  My name is Lisa.  I am sorry I didn&#39;t introduce<br/>\nmyself before but I learned a lot just by reading and listening.  Peace<br/>\nto you.
