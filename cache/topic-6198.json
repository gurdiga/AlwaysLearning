(although I do like to please him. That is also part of marriage,<br/>\neach of you trying to please the other) My husband helps tremendously with<br/>\nhousework, cooking, the kids, etc. (because he wants to please me!) Because<br/>\nof our example of working together and trying to please each other, my<br/>\ndaughter, who is only 18, has managed to find an incredible boyfriend, also<br/>\n18, who has no ego hangups about &quot;women&#39;s work&quot; and &quot;men&#39;s work&quot;.

Just not<br/>\nan entire book. :-) Also, if anyone knows any unschoolers in the Clovis, NM<br/>\narea or the Columbus, MS area, perhaps I could get in touch with them.

When you learn thoroughly it because it&#39;s FUN, <br/>\nwhy do you need a test?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think unschooling&#39;s best. You&#39;ve done your research. He&#39;s not willing to <br/>\nstudy up on Unschooling because why?---he doesn&#39;t like to LEARN anything new? <br/>\nHe just accepts what the masses/&quot;experts&quot; tell him?
