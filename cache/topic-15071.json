I&#39;m having the same trouble finding<br/>\nlike-minded people here in Long Beach on the coast.  Honestly it was more<br/>\ninclusive in Alabama where we had to homeschool under a church school law,<br/>\nbut there were non-religous inclusive groups all over the place. Down here<br/>\nif your not military (or have access to the bases) or willing to put in an<br/>\napplication and sign a statement of faith, your pretty much on your own.<br/>\nThere HAS to be more of us that want inclusive groups.. I really should put<br/>\nsome effort into a new group but its been hectic with me going back to<br/>\ncollege. .. maybe this fall.. hopefully<br/>\n<br/>\nkendra.. humidity? what humidity? it was only 75% today<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tammy Thompson [mailto:qpwithcheese@...]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 14, 2003 6:42 PM<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Unschoolers Utopia?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an Unschoolers Utopia?  Hubby and I are getting ready to leave here<br/>\nwithin the next couple years.  Mississippi just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore, and<br/>\nwe feel isolated.  This is my home state and we only moved back here because<br/>\nthe home school laws were much lighter(just fill out an enrollment form and<br/>\nthat&#39;s it) than where we were (Tennessee), plus my parents and sister are<br/>\ncloser (but we don&#39;t see them all that much anyway).   &lt;RANT&gt;It feels<br/>\nstifling here.  Not only do we not go to the local church,<br/>\nwhich is a standard question around here, but we don&#39;t belong to the local<br/>\nhomeschooling group because of the statement of faith and I get so tired of<br/>\nexplaining constantly that we homeschool.  I mean, homeschooling is supposed<br/>\nto be widespread around here from what I&#39;m told, but every time we are in<br/>\ntown during school hours the very same people who say that homeschooling is<br/>\npopular ask my kids why they aren&#39;t in school... well duh!  Even at the<br/>\nlibrary the other day, I signed the kids up for their book thing (read 5<br/>\nbooks and get a t-shirt, whoopee doo) so they could go to the little<br/>\nactivities they have this summer if they wanted too, the dude that gave us<br/>\nour forms kept telling the kids to write neatly and pick books in their<br/>\nreading level, and la de da...I was about ready to say forget it, but I just<br/>\ntold the kids to pick whatever book they wanted and levels don&#39;t mean<br/>\nanything(they&#39;ve already read and had read to them, I was just going to list<br/>\nthose). We just wanted t-shirts!  Geesh.   They wanted them to put what<br/>\ngrade they were going to be in next year, I asked my oldest what grade she<br/>\nwould choose to be in if she went to school..lol.  He didnt&#39; want me to sign<br/>\nup my 5yo and 2yo because they couldn&#39;t read!  But a librarian came over and<br/>\nsaid they can be read to and made him sign them up. lol.  I was pretty<br/>\ndisappointed in the schooliness of it. &lt;end rant&gt;   Anyway, we&#39;re hoping to<br/>\nfind an interesting, small to mid-size town, and<br/>\nunschool friendly.  Is there such a place?  Does anyone here live in a place<br/>\nsimilar to that?  Oh and hubby hates the humidity here too..lol.  tammy<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\nAlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
