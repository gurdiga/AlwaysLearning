It sort of sunk into me recently, and very very slowly.

I still say it less than I will so I make sure to enjoy it each time to encourage myself to say it more!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a very tight budget (basically no budget)  but I have found that by using redirection, as in the comments such as these <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Something like yes&quot; can be &quot;I wish I could afford to get that for you!&quot; Or &quot;Gosh it would be fun to have one of those; bummer they cost as much as a car payment!&quot;  -----<br/>\n<br/>\nOr even, avoiding the whole &quot;afford&quot; thing completely and using a phrase like, our priorities are.... whatever it is at the time....   Or even engaging the kids by reminding them of their goals, &#39;would you rather have X later or this now?&#39;, gives them some ownership of the decision and it seems to help. Even a 7 yo can understand why the car needs brake pads if we take the time to explain it to her. AND if you change the brakes yourself the child can see the brake guts.  Win!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children asked for another cat, I said, &quot;what do you think I&#39;m made of money?&quot;....lol, no I didn&#39;t,  I said, &quot;We have one cat and that is a comfortable number for our family right now.&quot;  I might have explained about food and litter and vets, I don&#39;t really remember, but I do know that they didn&#39;t freak out and scream and beg. They understood, and felt, I assume, respected because I took time to explain it. That does not mean that they wanted the cat any less or that it was a happy moment, just that they could accept it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also love to see the results of not buying. For example we attended some teen baseball games (free) recently but chose not to spend our money on bats for our 5 & 7 yo dd, but my oldest came to me and said that she didn&#39;t need one anyway because a stick worked just as well.  She also made a butterfly net out of a mesh bag from tangerines and a stick. I made sure not to throw it away and she played with it for several days.

Wrap up plain snacks in saved scraps of shiny paper or cloth. Dress up simple things in fancy packaging of your own. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else that can help is not to jump right to &quot;can&#39;t get it&quot; even in the sense of &quot;I wish we could get it&quot;. Don&#39;t start out *implying* that liking means purchasing or owning. What does she like about that thing? Admire it with her. Connect with her sense of fascination, of attraction first, rather than disappointment. That can help both of you shift your perspectives. After all, you can admire a sunset or a bird without falling into envy for not having one all your own.

The mom is one of the coolest unschoolers I know--not because of the &quot;stuff,&quot; but because she is relentlessly active in keeping up (and one step ahead of) her creative, active, engaged kid. The &quot;stuff&quot; supports his interests and he is keenly attuned to his interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir unschooling lives feel very much like others I know, except that he gets and expects to get more stuff--whether it is toys, classes, trips, etc. But even so, I&#39;m sure there are times that he doesn&#39;t. My sense is that it is his mom&#39;s engagement with him that is by far the more significant factor in his life. If their circumstances changed, I don&#39;t think it would be that big a deal, because she would still find ways to support everything--just at a different level and with more ingenuity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t grapple with the issue of whether it is o.k. to get him what he asks for because there&#39;s no need. They just get cool stuff when they find it. I think what you might be asking is whether you need to teach children the value of money by creating artificial limits.

We are a low-income family living in India. My daughter gets to know of the latest toys and snacks through TV ads and asks for them. A lot of them are beyond our means, especially the imported ones. I am wondering how parents with limited budgets respond to their children&#39;s requests for unaffordable things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am a little unclear on how the principle of always saying &#39;yes&#39; works with an unlimited budget. Would there be no restrictions on the number of times you can go to the toy store or the number of toys you can choose? <br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to add that I am completely blown away by how wise and generous some of you are. It has been less than a month since we got our daughter out of school and I cannot believe how far we&#39;ve come. Sandra&#39;s site, Joyce&#39;s site and this list have been the source of some of the best parenting advice I have ever got, and I am very grateful for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSanthy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62410,"nextTopicId":62432}}
