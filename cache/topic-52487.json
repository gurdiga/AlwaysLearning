She was the busy university student always working on her next assignment and he was the laid back videogamer totally doing his own thing and they both behaved as if it was all perfectly normal. I was surprised by that. I have to remind myself sometimes that they&#39;re not just &quot;my children&quot;, they have a relationship with each other that&#39;s nothing to do with their parents, and it always has been a very positive one. Bronnie was at her brother&#39;s birth, when she was ten years old, and watched him come out into the world. Maybe that was a &quot;bonding&quot; moment. As far as I&#39;m aware, Pat has been genuinely happy for his sister whenever she&#39;s added another achievement to her &quot;CV&quot; and not in the least bit envious. I do know that neither my wife nor I have ever said to him, &quot;You should be more like your sister&quot;!

And those are the things that are most important. I would be the first to say that my daughter&#39;s achievements are only one way of measuring &quot;success&quot; and it&#39;s a narrow way that by definition excludes most people. For me, my daughter&#39;s achievements have been an unexpected bonus - if it had all never happened, how I feel about her as a person wouldn&#39;t be any different. That&#39;s the point I was trying to make: I have, in my two children, one who is the epitome of what parents with &quot;social aspirations&quot; want their children to be like and one who is the epitome of what parents with social aspirations don&#39;t want their children to be like and I&#39;ve found that it really doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s the people my children are that are their &quot;success stories&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Trust.....and those people who make us doubt....","postDate":"1270817729","msgId":52568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGMEFBNzdCLTk0QkQtNEIyMi1BMDA2LTY1NkEwMEEyNUM1N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwbjZqdSthcGxuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwbjZqdSthcGxuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52567,"nextInTopic":52587,"prevInTime":52567,"nextInTime":52569,"topicId":52487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-That would describe my now grown up daughter Bronwyn, who was a straight A student through 13 years of school, Dux of the Year, President of the Student","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2113739189\">-=-That would describe my now grown up daughter Bronwyn, who was a  <br/>\n&quot;straight A&quot; student through 13 years of school, Dux of the Year,  <br/>\nPresident of the Student Council, has three university degrees (LLB  <br/>\n(Hons), BSc, BA) is an alumni of both the University of Canberra (and  <br/>\nhad her face on one their recruitment posters while she was there) and  <br/>\nof the Australian National University (the 11th highest ranked  <br/>\nuniversity in the world); who last December became a Member of the  <br/>\nSupreme Court of New South Wales at the age of 24; who is not only  <br/>\nbright but popular too, gregarious, adventurous, creative, energetic,  <br/>\nbusy - all of that. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard not to be impressed by that, but it&#39;s like winning a  <br/>\nlottery, in a way, if inclination, talent and work could help one win  <br/>\na lottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each impressive position, there are some number (sometimes  <br/>\nbillions) of people who are not-that.

How old? The odds against them get higher as the kids get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - it is just odds. Not every family that unschools will be super <br/>\nclose and not every family with school kids will have problems. I know a <br/>\nfamily with kids who went to school and they were very vested in it. The <br/>\nparents are fairly kind and gentle, but they have rules and regulations <br/>\nabout bed times and homework and video games, etc. The kids are in their <br/>\nearly twenties and I see them as having very sweet and loving <br/>\nrelationships with their parents. On the other hand, they did sneak <br/>\naround just a bit - in the &quot;normal&quot; teen/young adult ways. The son would <br/>\nsay he was one place when he really was somewhere else that he knew his <br/>\nparents disapproved of. Daughter lied about having alcohol at a party. <br/>\nThe kids are very compliant types and so the rules and regulations were <br/>\nvery much accepted and not struggled against, almost at all. And, on top <br/>\nof that, they aren&#39;t super high energy kids who make a lot of demands - <br/>\nthe whole family is very similar in their easygoing temperaments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother family I know seems to be like that - their daughters are <br/>\nyounger - 18 and 16 or so. They get along well with their parents and <br/>\nseem to really enjoy their family life a lot. But, the oldest is <br/>\ndeciding which college to go to - accepted by a number of them - and she <br/>\nis insistent that she wants to get away from home. That&#39;s different than <br/>\nhow my kids felt - they&#39;d rather live at home if possible - the idea of <br/>\n&quot;getting out&quot; isn&#39;t something they relate to when their friends talk <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there is a difference.

First, how old are the kids and have they reached teen years, and secondly, how is the relationship between parent and child and child and intimate partner/other.  I have seen successful school kids, I myself was one, who exhibited all the good sides without all the negative sides, but I have to say, even though I have a decent relationship with my parents, it&#39;s nothing like the one I have with my daughter.  NOTHING!  I repeated that because, even the best parent/child relationship of a school child and her parents still has a ton of barriers that and unschooling child won&#39;t have with her parents.  There are things that I still won&#39;t talk to my mother about, things that my own daughter is quite open about because she has never had a reason to hide anything from me or to have a life separate from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool life creates a need to keep family life separate.  There is this weird disconnect that happens to school kids and their parents, even the very best of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes school kids that are hugely active and involved in school life don&#39;t continue beyond school.  Once they are done with school, they are done with all that school entails, all that busy active stuff, etc.  It really depends and only time will tell.  Sometimes all that action creates burn out and sometimes a person will continue on with active stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I DESPERATELY want to hear stories from others about trusting their children, and learning to trust.***<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep reading here for sure!  I have a teenager who I absolutely trust.  She&#39;s smart and fun and kind and sweet.  I know that if she says she&#39;s going to do something, she will, or that if she&#39;s going to be somewhere she&#39;ll be there.  I have mostly good things to say about her, and the bad things are just plain old human nature things that we all do sometimes.  The trust thing though, is probably the biggest factor that contributes to how wonderful she is and how wonderful our relationship is!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Trust.....and those people who make us doubt....","postDate":"1270567869","msgId":52507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCQkI1M0JELjYwNTAxMDlAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwZjI0cytiMmhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwZjI0cytiMmhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52503,"nextInTopic":52522,"prevInTime":52506,"nextInTime":52508,"topicId":52487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Because this was at the end of Claire s post, I thought some people might not see it.

I also have a 19 year old son who was in public school until he was 12.

She says they&#39;ll be idiots and won&#39;t be able to do Algebra (haha!). She says, &quot;Look how unschooling has ruined your oldest.&quot; I always find that funny since he&#39;s mostly a product of the public school system in the USA. And how exactly is he ruined? He decided to get his GED at 18, the same age he would&#39;ve been if he had graduated from high school on time. He&#39;s now taking classes at the community college. He wants to get a degree in Culinary Arts and own his own restaurant one day. He&#39;s talked about that since he was 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how I deal with the criticism.

My kids are young (5 and nearly 3) but the idea of trusting them starts at birth.  In letting go of my desire to control them, to have my own way, I have been able to see that another person&#39;s ideas and plans are just as valid as mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I used to choose my daughter&#39;s clothes each day and insist she wear what I chose. One day I forced her to wear a particular pair of shorts even though she was crying and saying she didn&#39;t want to.  It seems unbelievable to me now that I would prioritise a pair of shorts over my daughter&#39;s happiness. That same day I vowed never to force my choice of clothing on her EVER.  I trust her to choose her own clothes, and I just provide factual information as to the weather or activities we will be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nImportantly, I have come to fully trust this whole philosophy of children having choices, to the point that I do not fear others&#39; judgement. (That&#39;s not to say my kids can do whatever with no regard for others.) As long as we are doing no harm, my children&#39;s choices are far more important to me than other people&#39;s opinions. For example, my almost 3 year old is still breastfeeding, and when we were out at a restaurant with my dad and step-mother recently, they told me I should stop. Although I was annoyed, I simply said in a mild tone, &quot;Why?&quot; Their only answer was that it was &quot;time to stop&quot;. Their vague discomfort and lack of information about the benefits of long-term breastfeeding in no way affects my happiness and willingness to meet my baby&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to your friend who has &#39;model&#39; school children and thinks that unschoolers never have to get out of bed, well the whole premise of her critique is absurd. Unschooling as discussed on this list is about active interesting parents offering lots of choices to their kids.  It&#39;s about a life rich in opportunities, discussion, ideas, fun. As the peace and joyfulness of an unschooling life becomes established in your home, your confidence will grow and others&#39; opinions will lose their power over you. You can still be open to new ideas, but with a deep-seated sense of assurance that your relationship with your kids comes first.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, it&#39;s taken me well over 2 years to reach this point.  Don&#39;t try to suddenly be the perfect unschooler right now today. Take small but steady steps towards better relationships, more understanding, more compassion.

I gave a lot of respect, choices and did a lot of trusting.<br/>\n&gt; Ididn�t ignore him. I was the resource. I listened, advised, and loved<br/>\n&gt; andlaughed and supported. Unschooling is license, it isn�t<br/>\n&gt; throwingconventional social rules out the window, but it is about taking<br/>\n&gt; arespectful approach to introducing social rules, and information. Its<br/>\n&gt; abouta dialogue and about working together. You are responsible for the<br/>\n&gt; child,but also responsible to the child.<br/>\n&gt; Marina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Trust.....and those people who make us doubt....","postDate":"1270523472","msgId":52490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwZThvZytkZWJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwZTFzbytzYmhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52487,"nextInTopic":52495,"prevInTime":52489,"nextInTime":52491,"topicId":52487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" TRUST - what a revelation the idea that children can be trusted with their own lives.

My son Ben who is 7 really didnt want to be there.. he typically prefers to stay home, but my other 3 had wanted to go so I sweetened the proposal by promising to go to get ice cream/ slushes at sonic on the way home.  Sonic is a drive thru restaurant that has a 1/2 price deal from 2-4 in the afternoon on their drinks and slushes. So he agreed.  Before we left the park he mentioned that he wanted a rootbeer float.  I told him I didnt think that was a good idea since it has icecream in it (he is allergic to milk, but has had these from Sonic in the past-with no difficulty).  And I said I thought he should get a slush.  He pouted for a second and said, &quot;Why dont you trust me to know what I can have?&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287778676,"authorName":"cheesyv2002","from":"&quot;cheesyv2002&quot; &lt;vanessa@...&gt;","profile":"cheesyv2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Trust.....and those people who make us doubt....","postDate":"1270516440","msgId":52487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwZTFzbytzYmhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52490,"prevInTime":52486,"nextInTime":52488,"topicId":52487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am new here - and just quickly I live in tasmania, Australia and have seven kids.

We have nearly always home/schooled with varying degrees of structure/non-structure, but despite being deeply drawn to un-schooling I have let fear hold me back for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nin the end the realisation that what we have been doing just isn&#39;t working, and the way our family is (relate to one another) etc isn&#39;t what it COULD be, has pointed to that this is what we need and always needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading on-line extensively for a few weeks, and have been and read the archives of this list on-line.  Great stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nTRUST - what a revelation the idea that children can be trusted with their own lives.  Instinctively i agree with it, but habit is going to be a tough one to crack with LIVING it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DESPERATELY want to hear stories from others about trusting their children, and learning to trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso....I&#39;d love to hear others experiences with dealing with those people who make you doubt. (Should that be make you choose to doubt?LOL?) There is one person whose single comment steered me away from un-schooling for years, the comment being that a certain home-schooling family wouldn&#39;t &quot;Amount to much&quot; because their children never had to do anything/get out of bed etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now completely challenge the notion of &quot;Amounting to much&quot; anyway, so that would no longer hold me back......, but another difficulty I have really felt over the years is that this same person has children who are like a living advertisement for the wonders of school without any of the negatives.  She is a close family member and our children are the same age.  it always felt very confronting that their children thrived and loved school and were creative and energetic and busy and happy, and we sort of puddled around at home doing not much.  there was like a &quot;look what your kids are missing&quot; theme to much of our interaction, not always spoken.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back this undermined my confidence, and i did much academics with them early out of fear/pressure/something to prove.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HAVE learned from that.  I AM determined to change, but I wanted to hear from others who have overcome doubts and subtle pressures from people they love .... to become truly free.<br/>\n<br/>\nFree, what a beautiful word!<br/>\nThanks in advance, and I have enjoyed reading all your recent posts on-line.<br/>\nVanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52536,"nextTopicId":52566}}
