But that doesn&#39;t make every possible choice morally right, or best for<br/>\nthe child, or compatible with the survival of the Libertarian society. To<br/>\nsatisfy these criteria, we must look more deeply than Libertarian political<br/>\nphilosophy  which is basically about how a society can run without the<br/>\ninitiation of physical force. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat justifies both Libertarian political philosophy and TCS education theory<br/>\nin my opinion is reason  something which, I fear, has yet to emerge in the<br/>\nspheres of education and childrearing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents do a very good job of bringing their children up to believe in<br/>\nauthority and obedience to dictators, whether parents or the state. Recently,<br/>\nI had the misfortune to be present when someone I know was subjected to a<br/>\nviolent attack by his parent. I was very shaken and didn&#39;t throw myself<br/>\nbetween my young friend and the angry adult, but I did manage to pluck up the<br/>\ncourage (once I poked my head up from behind the sofa where I was hiding) to<br/>\nexpress the opinion that hitting children may not be the best way to deal with<br/>\ndisagreements, and that it may not be entirely morally unobjectionable.<br/>\nPerhaps I was less diplomatic than The Parent thought appropriate, because he<br/>\naccused me of trying to coerce him into changing his parenting practices, and<br/>\nthen played the children-are-property card: It&#39;s none of your business how<br/>\nI raise my child. <br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t help wondering whether he would think it none of his business if I<br/>\nwere to pull out my trusty Smith and Wesson .44 magnum and start shooting at<br/>\nhis wife. Actually, they don&#39;t get on very well so perhaps that&#39;s a bad<br/>\nexample. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I&#39;m glad that when a thug was trying to kill my sister in broad<br/>\ndaylight on the streets of New York, the bystanders didn&#39;t take that view but<br/>\nsaved her life by intervening instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis Parent went on to say that my friend needed to be taught a lesson. Under<br/>\nnormal circumstances, since I think that such parents needs to learn better<br/>\nideas about how children learn, I would have removed my belt and offered to<br/>\nteach him a lesson if that would help him learn, but in this case, he was<br/>\nbigger than me and not living in a Libertarian paradise, I was unarmed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I mentioned my little exchange with the parent to a fellow Libertarian a<br/>\nfew days later, he accused me of wanting to make children wards of the state<br/>\nand have Big Brother dictate to us in our own personal affairs. (A bit like<br/>\nparents do to their children then. Of course Big Brother is only in charge<br/>\nwhen the parents aren&#39;t there to dictate to the children...) <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know this may sound very surprising to those of you who are, at this<br/>\nvery moment, convinced that ISIL have made a big mistake in asking me to speak<br/>\nhere, and that you are listening to a rabid statist who wants to take away<br/>\nparents&#39; rights, indeed, whose ideas make old Bill  Clinton  look like a<br/>\npositive paragon of Libertarian virtue, but if you have jumped to the<br/>\nconclusion that I want to take control of children out of the hands of parents<br/>\nand put it into Nanny  er, the nanny state, that is, you are very much<br/>\nmistaken. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were beating your wife for failing to have your socks sorted by colour,<br/>\nand I were to express the opinion that that may not be the best way to nurture<br/>\nyour relationship and might conceivably be the wrong thing to do, would you<br/>\njump to the conclusion that I was arguing that wives should be wards of the<br/>\nstate? Not unless you are more Neanderthal than your average man in the<br/>\nstreet! You would understand that I was asserting the idea that wives are<br/>\npeople whose control of their own lives should not be infringed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, I certainly do not think that children should be controlled by the<br/>\nstate instead of parents. I think that they should control their own lives,<br/>\njust as adults do. Indeed, TCS advocates raising children not just without<br/>\nbeating them but without doing anything to them against their will. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not advocating violating parents&#39; legal rights. What I am saying is that<br/>\nparents are right to behave in one way which is within their legal rights, and<br/>\nwrong to behave in another way which is also within their legal rights. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what does a particular theory of child-rearing, however right and however<br/>\nlibertarian in the everyday sense of the word, have to do with Libertarianism,<br/>\nthe political movement? I can tell from the incensed looks some of you are<br/>\ngiving me that you remain of the opinion that I&#39;m some sort of PC adult-hating<br/>\nleftist do-gooder with a touch too much arrogance for comfort, and that you<br/>\nare still asking Aren&#39;t parents in a Libertarian society free to bring up<br/>\ntheir children any way they like? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that some of you are already firmly convinced that TCS must be<br/>\nmistaken because according to Libertarian principles, as one of my Libertarian<br/>\nfriends said to me, If I want to turn off the TV until the kids have done<br/>\ntheir homework, I can. It&#39;s my TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is confusing right and wrong with legal and illegal. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow you may say, as my friend did, a trifle testily I thought, But why<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t I confuse right and wrong with legal and illegal? I am free to do<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t I?, and I&#39;ll agree that there should be no legal impediment<br/>\nstanding in your way here, but is it a good idea? Will it help you meet your<br/>\npreferences? Will it make you happy? Will it be right? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents say things like I paid for the TV so I can switch it off<br/>\nwhenever I like they are making the mistake of assuming that you can deduce<br/>\nhow to treat children  educational theory  from Libertarian principles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to give you some examples to show that that is a grave mistake. I want<br/>\nto show that a functioning Libertarian society needs knowledge which isn&#39;t in<br/>\nthe principles of a Libertarian society. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;m going to give you an example to show that a Libertarian society<br/>\nwon&#39;t survive if they have the wrong educational policy, that is, one that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t actually promote Libertarianism in the next generation. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that this example will show you a society which adheres completely to<br/>\nLibertarian principles but isn&#39;t viable, I am hoping that you will be<br/>\npersuaded that Libertarian principles alone are not enough to make a society<br/>\nviable. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a Libertarian society to survive and flourish, it must have a way of<br/>\npassing its ideas on to the next generation. Obviously, there&#39;s nothing<br/>\nautomatic about survival. I once had a particularly pleasant dream in which I<br/>\nand a bunch of frightfully agreeable Libertarians bought a beautiful tropical<br/>\nisland, declared independence and were living in freedom for ever. When I was<br/>\nrudely awoken at the unearthly hour of nine o&#39;clock in the morning by my<br/>\nneighbour having an argument with the gardener outside, I realised that not<br/>\nonly am I not living in my perfect Libertarian society, it was tipping down<br/>\nwith rain and I had to get to the Post Office to send off my tax return... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, imagine a group of Libertarians who somehow get political independence<br/>\non an island where they create their own ideal Libertarian society. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the principles of Libertarianism, they&#39;re now free to choose from<br/>\na vast range of possible lifestyles. They can grow as much cannabis as they<br/>\nlike without having to worry about being locked up  or waking up one morning<br/>\nto find that it has all been stolen. They&#39;re free to spend all their money on<br/>\ntheir dependants instead of financing state sinecures. In particular, they&#39;re<br/>\nentitled to bring their children up to be Libertarians. Or not to. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose that these people happen to share a dislike for children, so they<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any. Suppose also that they don&#39;t write books or allow outside<br/>\nvisitors to view their society. Will their society thrive? Perhaps for a<br/>\nwhile, but one thing we can predict without knowing any more about it than<br/>\nthat, is that because they&#39;re not passing on their Libertarian ideas, their<br/>\nlittle society is not going to be the nucleus of the future Libertarian world.<br/>\nUnless they perfect the technology of immortality, they&#39;ll eventually die out,<br/>\nand then the society they created, no matter how Libertarian, will no longer<br/>\nexist. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you thought those Libertarians were strange, here&#39;s an even stranger<br/>\ngroup: These people do have children, but they bring them all up as<br/>\ncommunists. This may be an unlikely scenario, but just consider the logic of<br/>\nit. There&#39;s nothing in a Libertarian society to stop parents doing that, is<br/>\nthere? They&#39;re free to bring up their children in any way they like, aren&#39;t<br/>\nthey? It&#39;s not illegal to be inconsistent is it? Not all the ways will be<br/>\nequally good for the children. Not all will be equally good for the society.<br/>\nSome of them will be perverse, some will be nasty, cruel, and morally wrong,<br/>\ndespite being legal. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time these perverse Libertarians are dead (or cryonically suspended),<br/>\nand only the grown-up children remain, the children will have instituted a<br/>\ncommunist government. Or maybe they won&#39;t have; maybe it&#39;s not so easy to<br/>\nbring up children to be communists: the Eastern bloc&#39;s educational systems<br/>\ntried very hard to do so, with only patchy success. <br/>\n<br/>\nClosed cultures such as the Amish survive by suppressing all creativity and<br/>\ninnovation but unless you&#39;re part of such a culture it&#39;s incredibly difficult<br/>\nto bring up children to believe any particular idea you intend them to believe<br/>\n(as many a parent will tell you). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t calculate all the unintended effects of your actions, you can&#39;t<br/>\ncontrol every possible outside influence or calculate the effects of those<br/>\noutside influences (though some parents do try  you should see what lengths<br/>\nmy neighbour goes to, to but I digress). So maybe these children won&#39;t end up<br/>\nbeing communists after all; but even the most optimistic among you will have<br/>\nto agree that it&#39;s all too easy to bring up one&#39;s children not to be<br/>\nLibertarians. Most parents already do that quite successfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo a Libertarian society, without violating any of the principles of<br/>\nLibertarianism, could ensure its own destruction, simply by choosing the wrong<br/>\nchild-rearing ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you may be thinking that although what I&#39;ve described is a logical<br/>\npossibility, it&#39;s a little farfetched. Why on earth should parents who believe<br/>\nin liberty choose to raise their children in such a way as to decrease their<br/>\nliberty  and to end up fearing and hating it as non-Libertarians do? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, in a way, I think that is just what you are doing (well, most of you<br/>\nanyway), or are planning to do when you become parents. Most parents do this.<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t what you intend, but neither do most left-wingers intend to ruin the<br/>\neconomy, do they? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a Libertarian society, it&#39;s legal to raise your children as communists  or<br/>\nDemocrats or Republicans  or to have all sorts of debilitating hang-ups, of<br/>\nwhich the fear of freedom is a common example, or to make them unhappy by<br/>\ninflicting every sort of psychological cruelty. Perfectly legal. Isn&#39;t it? <br/>\n<br/>\nTCS advocates raising children without doing anything to them against their<br/>\nwill or making them do anything against their will. I hope you are already<br/>\nbeginning to see why I have little patience with libertarians who object to<br/>\nthis by citing the parents&#39; legal rights. Yes, switching off the TV until they<br/>\nhave done their homework should be legal. But that does not make it harmless,<br/>\nnor does it make it any less vicious, nasty or morally wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a more general reason Libertarians need to think about more than just<br/>\na constitution or set of laws that determine when violence is and isn&#39;t<br/>\nlegitimate: <br/>\n<br/>\nInstalling the right laws cannot by itself guarantee that you will get a<br/>\nsociety that lives by those laws. That requires knowledge. This is the second<br/>\nlink I want to point out between education theory and Libertarian political<br/>\ntheory. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give an example: <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two kinds of country which have the US constitution. There are those<br/>\nwhich, after they have instituted the US constitution, get an open society in<br/>\nwhich all the constitutionally-protected human rights are respected (such as<br/>\nin the US itself), and there are those which just ignore the constitution.<br/>\nMerely introducing a Libertarian constitution would not ensure that liberty<br/>\nwas actually respected. <br/>\n<br/>\n(If you&#39;re thinking that the US isn&#39;t an example of a country in which all the<br/>\nconstitutionally-protected human rights are actually respected, and that in<br/>\nfact the US constitution is often violated, that just makes my point more<br/>\nstrongly. If America isn&#39;t a place where the rights laid down in the US<br/>\nConstitution are respected, what makes you think that, after it&#39;s replaced by<br/>\na new Libertarian Constitution, whether written or unwritten, the resulting<br/>\nsociety will respect that constitution?) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1989, Nigeria instituted a constitution strikingly similar to that of the<br/>\nUS. But has it produced a society like the US in terms of rights being<br/>\nrespected? Not exactly. Not unless you&#39;re being very uncharitable to the US. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the difference? Would Nigeria become a Libertarian society if it were<br/>\nlucky enough to have a constitution designed for it by the good people at<br/>\nISIL? No. If anything, adopting a Libertarian constitution would result in<br/>\neven more of a mess. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the US constitution was adopted in America, most people in the society<br/>\n(or at least the people who counted) were intellectually convinced that this<br/>\nconstitution was right; but the overwhelming majority of Nigerians would be<br/>\nconvinced that the ISIL constitution was not for them. Much as it would be in<br/>\ntheir interests to adopt an ISIL constitution, the idea is a non-starter. And<br/>\nif it were somehow implemented, people simply wouldn&#39;t act that way. The<br/>\nNigerians couldn&#39;t even behave in accordance with the US constitution, let<br/>\nalone a better one. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo having the right constitution or laws alone will not get you a Libertarian<br/>\nsociety. You need the right sort of people. You need people with the right<br/>\nideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow  here is a third way in which education theory and Libertarian political<br/>\ntheory are linked: <br/>\n<br/>\nSome Libertarians believe that children have rights, perhaps the same rights<br/>\nas adults. An intermediate position is that children have no rights other than<br/>\nto leave home and find new parents. At the other end of the spectrum are<br/>\nLibertarians who believe that children are, more or less, property, because<br/>\nthe parents buy the food which makes up the molecules of their bodies. These<br/>\ndifferent versions of Libertarian ideas would have different implications for<br/>\nhow parents would be allowed to educate their children, even in a Libertarian<br/>\nsociety  even in a Libertarian-anarchist society. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, at this moment there are thousands of children all over the<br/>\ncountry who want to leave home (or to leave school, or refuse consent to<br/>\nmedical procedures and so on), and in many of those cases the parents are<br/>\nviolently overriding their wishes, with the authority and assistance of the<br/>\nstate as well as of most bystanders on whose assistance the parents choose to<br/>\ncall. Now imagine that an anarchist revolution is achieved. What will happen<br/>\nnext? <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the anarchists will regard all that parental violence as justified.<br/>\nOthers will regard it as the epitome of injustice. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two kinds of people will think it legitimate violently to assist whichever<br/>\nside they think is in the right. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a civil war ensues  this isn&#39;t so farfetched: something very similar<br/>\nhappened in regard to slaves, following an earlier revolution for liberty  it<br/>\nwill be because although the individuals in that society agreed that violence<br/>\nis legitimate only in self-defence  they disagreed about which entities have<br/>\na self in the appropriate sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow you may wish that everyone agreed with your particular conception of<br/>\nLibertarianism. But although you may well have stumbled upon the ultimate<br/>\ntruth about what a Libertarian society should be like, you have to admit<br/>\nyou&#39;ve failed to hit upon the ultimate truth about how to propagate that idea<br/>\nto each other  let alone to the next generation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we are discussing here is a kind of knowledge. This knowledge is<br/>\nphilosophical, it is epistemological, it is psychological. It is knowledge<br/>\nthat is necessary for the functioning of a Libertarian society, but it can&#39;t<br/>\nbe derived from Libertarian principles. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the knowledge of what sort of citizen would make a society which is<br/>\nnominally Libertarian actually function as such. That includes knowledge in<br/>\nthe mind of such a citizen. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it include the knowledge of how to make such a citizen? Not exactly. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe it&#39;s either moral or rational to bring up children to propagate<br/>\na certain political view. Such a thing should be anathema to any advocate of<br/>\nliberty, and in my opinion, to any decent parent too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am trying to illustrate with these examples  the libertarian society<br/>\nthat dies after a generation; the nominally libertarian society imposed on<br/>\npeople with non-libertarian ideas; the civil war about children&#39;s rights  is<br/>\nthat a functioning Libertarian society will depend on the existence of<br/>\nknowledge that cannot be obtained from Libertarian principles alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo discover such knowledge we must look to what underlies those principles<br/>\nthemselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, their underlying justification is epistemology. Applied<br/>\nepistemology is otherwise known as education theory. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to seek an education theory that grows from the same roots as<br/>\nLibertarianism, but it is a colossal mistake to try to derive educational<br/>\ntheory from Libertarianism. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason I&#39;m a Libertarian is that I believe that human beings are<br/>\nfallible. That the powerful, in particular, are fallible and can&#39;t be trusted<br/>\nto be right. Not kings, not bureaucrats  and not parents or teachers either. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I agree with Karl Popper that the question isn&#39;t who should rule? but<br/>\nhow can we limit the harm they do? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn education theory, the who should rule? debate is still alive and<br/>\nvirtually unchallenged. Should it be parents? Teachers? School boards? The<br/>\ngovernment? The UN...? (A better answer would of course be me.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as always when you start with that question, the answer is tyranny. The<br/>\nreal question is: how can institutions be set up within a family in such a way<br/>\nthat no one  including the children  is ruled. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that differences of opinion can be resolved, not only without the<br/>\ninitiation or threat of force (which is as far as Libertarian theory can<br/>\npossibly take us), but without force at all: by reason, which implies by<br/>\nconsent. <br/>\n<br/>\nLibertarians today differ about many things  I have already mentioned<br/>\nchildren&#39;s rights  but also whether, say, intellectual property is really<br/>\nproperty, whether abortion is murder or not, and so on. What we really want,<br/>\nand the whole point of a Libertarian society, and of a free society in general<br/>\nas I see it, is not to entrench particular answers to such questions, but to<br/>\nallow bad answers to be replaced by better ones. A fixed rule, such as the<br/>\nparent is always right is inherently irrational and will systematically pick<br/>\nthe wrong answer. Family institutions that enforce such a rule are irrational. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs good Libertarians and good parents, we should want our children to be able<br/>\nto correct our errors. And by able, we should mean not just legally able<br/>\n(that is to say, they won&#39;t be thrown in prison or punished by their parents<br/>\nif they try) but psychologically able to, which means that they won&#39;t feel<br/>\nfear or guilt or the weight of parental disapproval if they try. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we need  what TCS provides  is a completely different rhythm of family<br/>\nlife; as different as an open society is from a paternalistic dictatorship. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo understand Libertarianism you have to understand that living in liberty<br/>\nisn&#39;t just a pleasant experience, like eating raspberries. Liberty isn&#39;t just<br/>\na good, it&#39;s a condition for goods to be created. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, tyranny  the initiation of force  isn&#39;t just an un*pleasant<br/>\nexperience, like having a large teganaria giganiticus* charging at your bare<br/>\nfeet from across the room (if you hate spiders, that is!) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as you do think of it in that subjective way, you miss the point, and<br/>\nlay yourself open to wicked arguments about tradeoffs  So, Mr Irresponsible<br/>\nLibertarian, how many children are you willing to see die of heroin poisoning<br/>\nor in gun accidents, just to give you the nice warm feeling of living in<br/>\nliberty? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t that some people hate spiders, some people hate taxes. Those are<br/>\nnot the same kind of thing. The Libertarians&#39; hatred of taxation is<br/>\nstructurally different. John Gray, who wrote that deplorably defeatist book<br/>\nLiberalisms, disagrees, but he&#39;s wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something more than personal preferences underlying the liberalisms,<br/>\nin particular Libertarianism, and it does make sense, and it&#39;s reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for the Libertarian hatred of taxation is that the institution of<br/>\ntaxation is, in an extended sense, irrational. Not necessarily in the narrow<br/>\nsense that the word rational has historically been used, but in the most<br/>\ngeneral sense: There are patterns of thinking that can work (that is, create<br/>\nthe knowledge needed to solve the problems and meet the preferences of the<br/>\nperson doing the thinking), and patterns that can&#39;t work (except by unlikely<br/>\ncoincidence). For instance, logical deduction can work when trying to solve a<br/>\nmathematical problem, but, as generations of exam-takers have found, prayer<br/>\ncannot. Scientific reasoning can work when trying to understand the physical<br/>\nworld, but logical deduction in the absence of experimentation cannot, and nor<br/>\ncan prayer. <br/>\n<br/>\nRationalism is the theory that the patterns of thinking that can work are the<br/>\nrational ones  where the exact criterion for a process being rational<br/>\ndepends on which species of rationalism one adopts. The one appropriate to TCS<br/>\nis the same as the one that I believe is appropriate to the liberalisms in<br/>\ngeneral and to Libertarianism in particular: it is what is known as critical<br/>\nrationalism, but with the proviso that we include unconscious and inexplicit<br/>\nknowledge and thought uniformly in our scheme of things. (Thus a rational<br/>\nprocess need not rely on verbal reasoning.) As fallibilists, we don&#39;t expect<br/>\nthere to be a closed definition of rational: the exact criteria are always<br/>\nunder critical review. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be rational in the fallibilist, critical-rationalist sense, a process has<br/>\nto be truth-seeking, evolutionary, open to new ideas and to criticism of old<br/>\nones, avoid entrenchment of particular ideas, judge ideas according to content<br/>\nrather than source ... and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn science, these criteria lead to Popper&#39;s conclusion that theories about<br/>\nmeasurable phenomena must be experimentally testable if progress is to be<br/>\npossible. In political theory, they lead to Libertarianism. In psychology and<br/>\neducation theory, they lead to TCS. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe places where reason has gained substantial ground over the last few<br/>\nhundred years, are specifically, in the areas of human rights, and in the<br/>\neconomy, and in science. If we call this the Enlightenment in the public<br/>\nsphere, TCS is about extending the Enlightenment into the private sphere, and<br/>\nspecifically into the sphere of child rearing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe ask, applying the same philosophical principles as underlie the<br/>\nEnlightenment generally, what sort of institutions within the family promote<br/>\nthe growth of knowledge in the same sense that the external laws of a<br/>\nLibertarian society promote the growth of knowledge in the society as a whole,<br/>\nand the rules of the scientific community promote the growth of scientific<br/>\nknowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can define a Libertarian society as one in which political issues are<br/>\ndecided by reason rather than force or blind obedience to tradition. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a non-Libertarian society, if I earn a hundred pounds, the criterion of<br/>\nchoosing how that should be spent isn&#39;t unanimous agreement between all the<br/>\nparties, it&#39;s voting, and ultimately the use of police power to take the money<br/>\nfrom me against my will. Whereas in a Libertarian society, every possible use<br/>\nof the money I earn has to have my consent. So in society at large, the<br/>\nalternative to consent is force. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in human relationships the absence of consent doesn&#39;t necessarily amount<br/>\nto force. It&#39;s a wider class of behaviours, which includes force: there are<br/>\nmany patterns of interaction between people in close relationships that don&#39;t<br/>\nresolve issues by reason at all, yet don&#39;t involve force either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent gives Little Billy a telling off, she may use no physical force<br/>\nand no overt threat of force, but it is still not reason. Despite this being a<br/>\nmere exercise of the parent&#39;s freedom of speech, little Billy does not<br/>\nconsent to it. Even while he is having the flow of ideas initiated in his mind<br/>\nby the telling-off, he simultaneously wishes he were not. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent gives Sally a choice between, on the one hand, taking out the<br/>\nrubbish and having dinner, and on the other hand, not getting any dinner, she<br/>\nis acting in such a way to put Sally into the psychological state of enacting<br/>\none theory while one or more conflicting theories remain active in her mind.<br/>\nShe is causing Sally to act literally against her will. Sally doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\ntake out the rubbish but fear of not getting any dinner effectively forces her<br/>\nto do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven making disappointed faces at your children to shame them into complying<br/>\nworks in the same way, psychologically, instead of causing a genuine, FREE<br/>\nchange of mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome Libertarians I know force their children to eat everything on their plate<br/>\n presumably not on the basis that there are starving children in Africa  no<br/>\ndoubt they have some other pseudo-justification for this viciously immoral and<br/>\nharmful practice, but the psychological effect upon the child is the same<br/>\neither way. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may not be state tyranny, but if you are being controlled by someone else,<br/>\nit feels bad whether it is the state or your parent. And in both cases, life<br/>\nwould be better for all if reason were applied instead of force. <br/>\n<br/>\nReason also requires seeking truth, because if you are not seeking truth, you<br/>\nare unlikely to find it. It is because rational processes seek a common and<br/>\nobjective truth that they tend to reach agreement, and it is this tendency<br/>\nthat powers the continual discovery of common preferences that replaces the<br/>\ncommand structure of conventional education and parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeeking the truth requires remaining open to criticism and change, because<br/>\notherwise you will fail to drop false theories even when better ones are to<br/>\nhand. Failing to drop refuted theories is incompatible with reason. But that<br/>\nis exactly what a child is required to do, when he is coerced into learning<br/>\nsomething against his will. He prefers one activity; perforce he engages in<br/>\nanother. This is irrational. And because it is irrational, it fails to create<br/>\nknowledge. Rote learning isn&#39;t knowledge in the true sense, merely the<br/>\nsemblance of knowledge, just as inflated money is the semblance of wealth. <br/>\n<br/>\nJudging ideas by their source rather than their content is incompatible with<br/>\nreason  so mother knows best, and because I say so are the archetypes of<br/>\nirrational child-rearing just as much as using the parent&#39;s physical strength<br/>\nto settle a dispute would be. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what TCS asks is of a piece with what Libertarianism asks in regard to<br/>\npolitics and economics, namely: what rules of engagement in interpersonal<br/>\nrelationships have the property that rival ideas will be judged by reason (and<br/>\ncan therefore approach the truth)? This is what leads us to TCS educational<br/>\ntheory, whose most striking feature, especially to the newcomer, is the idea<br/>\nthat it is desirable and possible to bring up children without doing things to<br/>\nthem against their will. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an economic transaction takes place only with the unanimous consent of<br/>\nall parties, so TCS family life seeks the unanimous consent of the family<br/>\nmembers  including the children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe TCS project is the construction of institutions within the family which do<br/>\nfor the growth of knowledge there what the public institutions of capitalism,<br/>\ncommon law and so on do for the growth of wealth, science and other knowledge<br/>\nthat involves the cooperation of strangers. So TCS is the final, most<br/>\ndifficult, but also the most valuable, stage of the Enlightenment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe future of liberty is TCS.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Debate?
