Lara is still working out of hers too.  ****We try to work out of it 3 or 4 days a week.  It&#39;s just a great way to make sure they&#39;re keeping up, ya know?****&quot; (by Heather)...*that* is what peeked my interest because in *my* definition of unschooling that goes against the basic principle (Of strictly child led learning).. Linda did come back and explain why she does that with her son and I fully understand and can relate to it....Now I understand Heather&#39;s point of view and Linda&#39;s a bit better...but in my eyes there is nothing for Shanika to &#39;keep up&#39; with; as part of my unschooling I have thrown out the &#39;bars&#39; and &#39;goals&#39; the public school has, so she is never ahead, behind, or even on the same level as anyone else..Her learning is strictly hers. Am I making sense here? I am not saying Heather and Linda are wrong in their views, they are just different than mine =).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes Shanika uses workbooks (I&#39;ve said this but it must have gotten lost..) she has one for handwriting she is really into right now..She picks it up when she feels like it and puts it down when she does as well..She has unfettered access to all things around her including TV and the CPU. I dont tell to or coerce her into using anything...She could NEVER pick up a geometry book and that would be OK with me..She could NEVER learn cursive and that would be ok with me...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo *ME* there are several different types of homeschoolers: School at home (strict curriculum users) Eclectic (will use curriculum in a non child led way for some subjects/will unschool on some issues/nice mix of both) and Unschoolers (completely child led learning).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I &quot;see&quot; unschooling in the title of a group I relate it to what MY definition of unschooling is, that is why I asked what other people see unschooling as, because I gleaned that my definition and someone elses may not match. To me some of the people on this list are eclectic homeschoolers, and that is *great*; I dont behoove anyone their way of teaching their children, nor do I think &#39;my&#39; way is &#39;better&#39; than anyone elses..I just need to know what &#39;angle&#39; on unschooling/homeschooling everyone has so that I can better understand their point of view ..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns. Therefore, we do not need to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying. We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning. What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we can into the school and classroom (in our case, into their lives); give children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and then get out of the way. We can trust them to do the rest.&quot; ~John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNichoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFertility Friend Online Support Guide <br/>\nNow you CAN conceive online..<br/>\nwww.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pat Cald... <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, February 01, 2002 1:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] I need to be built back up..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Nichoel <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;I am especially licking my wounds over, after posting &#39;my&#39; definition of unschooling at the &gt;list&#39;s request, getting this in response:<br/>\n<br/>\n  What was the definition of unschooling you posted?
