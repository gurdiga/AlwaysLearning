I would be offering <br/>\nthese activities with the idea of exposing them to new things. **<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch. My head hurts just thinking about this. :)  You&#39;re trying SO hard to <br/>\nfind a formula you can use to guarantee results. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion, nope, yup, maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what are you thinking of here? One day a week is marked on the calendar as <br/>\n&quot;mom&#39;s activity day&quot;? Or you get to offer an activity any day but then you&#39;re <br/>\ndone for the week? Or just trying to average things out? What happens when <br/>\nthere are three great things going on in town on the same weekend that your <br/>\nkids won&#39;t know about unless you tell them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens if they don&#39;t respond to what you offer, even after trying it? <br/>\nExposing kids to new things is like exposing them to chicken pox. Sometimes <br/>\nthey&#39;ll catch them, sometimes they won&#39;t. And the kids should be able to say <br/>\n&quot;no thanks&quot; without feeling guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering what you mean by &quot;offering&quot; new activities? Places to go, <br/>\npeople to see, things to do? If it&#39;s just once a week, how do you keep from <br/>\nmaking those things seem more important and compulsory than everything you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t choose to offer? And how will you deal with rejection?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days, we exist in a virtual sea of &quot;new things&quot;, others we&#39;re content <br/>\nand snuggled up with the familiar. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand - &lt;g&gt; it can be a help sometimes to have a plan to always <br/>\nget out on the same day every week. When my youngest were smaller it was <br/>\nsometimes a real chore to pack everyone up to go ANYWHERE, and so if it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t planned it didn&#39;t happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4965,"nextTopicId":4865}}
