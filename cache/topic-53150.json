Until now, my daughter Temima s (nearly 4 years old) problems","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1989103217\">Hi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt recently became clear to me that we are experiencing some sibling <br/>\nrivalry here.  Until now, my daughter Temima&#39;s (nearly 4 years old) <br/>\nproblems were focused on me - on my choosing between her and the baby.  <br/>\nWe did work through that, found peaceful ways, mostly, to get everyone&#39;s <br/>\nneeds met, mostly (there were a lot of missed naps for the baby <br/>\ninvolved, but I think he&#39;s ok &lt;grin&gt;).  I think that recently her <br/>\nfeelings have morphed into a more direct sort of sibling rivalry.  Her <br/>\nbrother is 14 months old, and is fast becoming a toddler.  So much more <br/>\npotential for their play (and I see how she loves to help him learn and <br/>\n&#39;teach&#39; him new things).   But she is also much more inclined to focus <br/>\non how he interferes with what she wants and make issue of things that <br/>\nare difficult to change (the &#39;rivalry&#39;, I think).  For example, she <br/>\nwants to eat on the floor, or sitting on the sofa, or in other easy to <br/>\nreach places when the baby is crawling around.  He goes after her food, <br/>\nand she kicks, screams and is very emotional.  I try to minimize the <br/>\noccurances of this by feeding him in his high chair, or distracting him <br/>\nand playing with him while she eats.  I also try to encourage her to <br/>\nfind, and offer her options, for ways/places to eat where he can&#39;t grab <br/>\n(since I can&#39;t keep him occupied indefinitely, and she doesn&#39;t want me <br/>\nto leave the room with him), but she refuses all of those.  It feels <br/>\nlike she WANTS to create that conflict, to prove a point (or what the 3 <br/>\nyear old version of proving the point is).  I guess the &#39;point&#39; is that <br/>\nhe shouldn&#39;t dictate where she eats?  In any case, that is one example.  <br/>\nI would appreciate some advice or reading material.  I&#39;ve got Siblings <br/>\nwithout Rivalry on hold at the library, and I&#39;ve read Sandra&#39;s pages (or <br/>\nthe ones I could find), but they seemed to be about older examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52969,"nextTopicId":52979}}
