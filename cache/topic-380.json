STRUCTURE, FLOW AND BALANCE: CREATING THE LIFE YOU WANT<br/>\nUnschooling gives us a unique freedom to create the lives we want to live<br/>\neach day, week and year.  This is a challenge to do with the many interests,<br/>\nactivities and needs of each family member.  We will use writing and art as<br/>\ntools to envision how we want our lives to look and feel and to map out the<br/>\nideal week, month, year for ourselves and our families.  Linda Ugelow<br/>\n<br/>\nB. HOW LEARNING HAPPENS  Doubts about unschooling often stem from<br/>\nmisconceptions  about how learning happens. Cultural beliefs and our own<br/>\nschool experiences created these misconceptions, whereas our personal<br/>\nexperiences completely contradict them. Come explore how learning  really<br/>\nhappens. You will leave this workshop infused with renewed confidence to<br/>\nfollow your unschooling heart.  Andy Migner<br/>\n<br/>\nC. BUILDING COMMUNITY  The unschooling lifestyle provides fertile ground for<br/>\nthe seeds of community to sprout and flourish.  Using games and discussion,<br/>\nwe’ll explore techniques to nurture those seeds: leadership, communication,<br/>\nrituals, socializing, mentoring.  Share practical experiences and<br/>\nchallenges, and get ideas you can take home and cultivate.
