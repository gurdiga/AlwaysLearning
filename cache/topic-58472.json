I ve been thinking about the OP s question(s) a lot since","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-726109405\">I saw this message come through while we were away (visiting extended family) on another tour of DC.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the OP&#39;s question(s) a lot since I first read them and find the way the conversation has moved interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved from Alaska to the east coast to be closer to family.  My husband has a 14 year-old daughter who lives here, and being closer to her trumped the amazing community we&#39;d built for ourselves during the 10 yrs we lived up north. At the time, dh&#39;s mom lived in the UK (now she is split between DC and Vermont), and my dad, stepmom, brother, step-brothers, a few nieces and nephews and uncle are here too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, being close to extended family has absolutely added to our success with unschooling.  Our case is &quot;extreme&quot;: My husband, daughter and I now live with my dad and stepmom because we couldn&#39;t afford to live on one salary otherwise.  While I did work, having grandma available to watch our daughter made that possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my parents grew up in multi-family homes with their grandparents and in my mom&#39;s case, an aunt, uncle and their two kids as well (big old Brooklyn brownstones, though, where everyone had their own apartment).  For the last years of both my grandmothers&#39; lives, they lived with my parents (who by that time were divorced).  Growing up, I used to long for the kind of lives my mom and dad talked about--going downstairs to grandma&#39;s apartment for cookies and a story, going upstairs to see what aunt and uncle made for dinner when the home-fare wasn&#39;t desirable, always a safe place to retreat to when family life was overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t be the whole story to say that the only way extended family help our unschooling is with financial support.  My daughter&#39;s life is so much richer for having more loving adults in her daily life.  She builds things with my dad, she reads with her grandmother. While she sometimes talks about missing our little apartment, she is very clear that right now, she wants to live with her grandparents forever.  It isn&#39;t always easy (for me and Michael) but the benefits far outweigh the draw-backs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur situation isn&#39;t always possible, or the &quot;best&quot; choice, though.  A few years ago I was offered a great job at a small university not too far from my mother-in-law.  We were already committed to homeschooling, and decided my husband would be the stay-at-home parent if I took the job.  We found a house and were getting ready to sign a lease when we realized that living that close to my MIL wouldn&#39;t be a good thing for our family.  Her relationship with dh was never one built on honesty and respect.  It has, for the most part, been pretty toxic, actually, and we realized she wouldn&#39;t respect our boundaries--that she&#39;d be too much a part of our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is more I could say about community vs. family, but I think it comes down to what your relationships with each really are.  What works for one family won&#39;t work for another.  One family may trust where another is skeptical, or worse (as we feared with my MIL), try to sabotage unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Extended Family and Successful Unschooling","postDate":"1292507521","msgId":58484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9cUxSakgxU25zPWdFcW9RWWY3TGZjMDczWlRZbituPUNwOFVZR0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyMjFBRjMzRDY1RjRFODhBQThEOEVFRkJGOUE5RUYwQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk3NDQzNy40NTI4MS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1Rpa3EyLW81U1UtUz16Q2hpd0duQ25zdGZBaTNTVVhfK2FEeVdiUkZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTw1ODQ0MjQuMzQ2NzMucW1Ad2ViODM1MDQubWFpbC5zcDEueWFob28uY29tPgk8Q0QzRjBCM0QtMEM5NC00RDRDLUE5MkUtRjNFRjlFQ0FEQjc1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8MDIyMUFGMzNENjVGNEU4OEFBOEQ4RUVGQkY5QTlFRjBAQ29ubmllUEM+"},"prevInTopic":58483,"nextInTopic":58485,"prevInTime":58483,"nextInTime":58485,"topicId":58472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... people of all different types of beliefs.

The thing about communities is that there are<br/>\nexpectations that come with them (which is what &quot;common belief&quot; is). We<br/>\nstarted going to a Unitarian Universalist church last year or so. We have<br/>\nall gotten sporadic about going at this point. At first I got into the<br/>\npolitical/social justice idea, then I felt that it was much more and a<br/>\ndifferent involvement than I wanted for going to church or even just hanging<br/>\nout with people. And I *like* their ideas very much. That&#39;s no problem. I&#39;m<br/>\njust feel very hedged in by the singular mindset even of very likeminds, and<br/>\nwould prefer to branch out into other interests. Maybe that will come with<br/>\nmore time and familiarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things being into art and into unschooling have done for me is to<br/>\nbring a greater appreciation for all kinds of thinking, thoughts, activities<br/>\nand expressions than is usual to see within any community I&#39;ve ever been<br/>\npart of. We still hang loosely with our beloved UU. I still keep in touch<br/>\nwith some of the people I met when I was more into art, and I&#39;ve met more<br/>\nartists since then. We love to travel but it&#39;s just us. Brian is getting<br/>\nmore into music. Karl has friends and lots of cousins locally as well the<br/>\noccasional visit with those who live far away, family (who we visit about<br/>\ntwice a year) and friends. For myself, I like the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, all this does have a lot to do with the individual as well as to an<br/>\nadditional interest in diversity. I sometimes wonder how much of liking my<br/>\nown company and doing things by myself has to do with childhood<br/>\nconditioning. Probably more than I&#39;d like to admit to even. Bringing that<br/>\nthought back around to unschooling, it&#39;s something I have noticed in myself<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t like about relating with my child. Getting out of the<br/>\nprogrammed rut of staying on my own thing so much would be better for me and<br/>\nKarl.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went off on a tangent.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Extended Family and Successful Unschooling","postDate":"1292476844","msgId":58483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMjFBRjMzRDY1RjRFODhBQThEOEVFRkJGOUE5RUYwQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENEM0YwQjNELTBDOTQtNEQ0Qy1BOTJFLUYzRUY5RUNBREI3NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDk3NDQzNy40NTI4MS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxBQU5Ma1Rpa3EyLW81U1UtUz16Q2hpd0duQ25zdGZBaTNTVVhfK2FEeVdiUkZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw1ODQ0MjQuMzQ2NzMucW1Ad2ViODM1MDQubWFpbC5zcDEueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0QzRjBCM0QtMEM5NC00RDRDLUE5MkUtRjNFRjlFQ0FEQjc1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58482,"nextInTopic":58484,"prevInTime":58482,"nextInTime":58484,"topicId":58472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I tend to focus on friends rather than community. It is much easier to schedule get togethers with one or two people than it is to be obligated to a community type group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It is possible (it is, in some cases, definitely true) that the distant relatives seem warm because they&#39;re distant. Or because visits are rare, they withhold criticism. Or maybe they don&#39;t see details and so don&#39;t comment. I&#39;ve had near and distant relatives. I&#39;ve heard stories of people moving to other states (even other countries) to get nearer people they expected to have be as warm as they were on infrequent visits, but when they were local, the warmth became everyday, distracted, busy behavior. It wasn&#39;t meanness. It was the difference between being on vacation and being at work, or between being a houseguest, and being back home with all the responsibilities and laundry and errands and floors.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband and I moved away from my family to be closer to his family. When we made the move several years ago, we knew that we were going to homeschool but hadn&#39;t yet decided to unschool. I hadn&#39;t even really heard of unschooling at that point in time. I thought that moving closer to his family would be nice because his family seemed to be very community oriented. There were a lot of things about his family that I liked. They led me to believe that things would be one way when we got there but they were actually totally different. I never realized how critical my husband&#39;s parents were because we only saw them once a year. Being around them all the time made me realize that we had made a bad decision. We ended up moving back to where we had lived before the move. My family isn&#39;t perfect but at least they were a lot more open to homeschooling. Unschooling didn&#39;t even enter into the equation. My family can be critical at times but my girls really like them because they tend to be rather laid back and are at least more open to exploring new ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Unschoolers (nor anyone with similar interests or beliefs) have no obligation to become community with other unschoolers.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found that my family gets a lot more out of hanging out with people of all different types of beliefs.
