Maybe that sounds mean but<br/>\nthe alternative was to constantly yell at her, take away her food<br/>\n(she&#39;d turn around and grab another bite, then turn back to play, she<br/>\nwas still hungry), hit her, etc. whatever people do to &quot;teach&quot; kids to<br/>\nstop doing things like that.

It&#39;s totally<br/>\n&gt; personal to the individual body and needs of that body.  Some kids eat a<br/>\n&gt; lot even if they were never deprived of food.  My friend&#39;s little kid,<br/>\n&gt; at the age of 3 and 4 ate twice as much food as I did for every meal. <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s almost 15 now and is super tall and skinny.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am an adoptive parent as well and we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brought our oldest daughter home at 18 months. At that time she was<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only child and we allowed her to have everything she could possibly<br/>\n&gt; want.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s how she stayed overweight for about one year.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How does anyone know that a 3 or 4 yr old is overweight?  Is it by how<br/>\n&gt; they look?  Is it by how much they weigh?  Will they really stay that<br/>\n&gt; way after a couple of years?  The child mentioned above was a huge baby<br/>\n&gt; and a very round little kid, she was extremely heavy, very solid.  She<br/>\n&gt; still weighs a lot, but she&#39;s not overweight by any means, she very very<br/>\n&gt; thin and has a hard time finding pants tiny enough around the waist and<br/>\n&gt; still long enough for her super long legs.  How could anyone have<br/>\n&gt; predicted that when she was 3 or 4?  There is only one other really tall<br/>\n&gt; person in her family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a really hard time accepting someone calling a little kid<br/>\n&gt; overweight, even for a year.  Kids are growing and changing all the<br/>\n&gt; time.  One year a kid may be very round and the next they may grow tall.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I saw that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t helping her to give into her every demand for food and started<br/>\n&gt; saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no and helping to implement healthy choices. She&#39;s almost 10 now and<br/>\n&gt; is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healthy happy little girl who is very bonded to her Daddy and I.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being 10 and bonded is great, but it has nothing to do with food issues.<br/>\n&gt; Just because you&#39;ve implemented &quot;healthy&quot; choices, doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>\n&gt; will ever control what your child eats or how it will affect her.  10 is<br/>\n&gt; still young, the teen years are looming ahead.  A healthy 10 yr old<br/>\n&gt; eating what her parents see as healthy will NOT garauntee that it will<br/>\n&gt; produce a healthy 14 yr old happily eating what her parents deem<br/>\n&gt; healthy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I object to the idea of &quot;giving into&quot; demands of a child.  As parents,<br/>\n&gt; we can either be their partners and help them get what they want or we<br/>\n&gt; can set life up so that everything is doled out by the parents and<br/>\n&gt; requested by the child and given at the parent&#39;s discretion.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; help natural learning when a child can&#39;t make the decision for<br/>\n&gt; themselves as to what is good and healthy and enough.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133511862,"authorName":"Teresa","from":"Teresa &lt;teresacommliving@...&gt;","profile":"hsmamaca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] food again","postDate":"1235586751","msgId":42495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1ODMxNS4zNjk5NS5xbUB3ZWI0NTQwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDVEMUZDRDUyLTAzQ0UtNDRDQi1CNEIxLTFFM0IxMzNFMjBGMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42492,"nextInTopic":42496,"prevInTime":42494,"nextInTime":42496,"topicId":42462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just an odd suggestion.  Have you tried giving him something like an entire head of iceberg lettus and helped/shown how he can eat it layer by crunchy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-628580752\">Just an odd suggestion.  Have you tried giving him something like an entire head of iceberg lettus and helped/shown how he can eat it layer by crunchy layer?  It is one of those foods you can eat all you want of and not get too much of anything that will upset your digestion. It also has a very satisfying way of disappearing slowly into a tiny ball. There are other similar foods like a nice loaf of french bread perhaps with a olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip.  Just something big he can sit and munch on that isn&#39;t too unhealthy but will satisfy his visual faculties and requires some creativity to eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought.  Does he have a food allergy or intolerance?  Some celiacs crave and eat a lot of breads and other gluten filled products and so do some people with milk and other food allergies.  just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso helping them learn about proper nutrition so they can have the information they need to make healthy food choices.  Not sure what it&#39;s called in the US but in Canada we have the Canada food Guide and in the past it was taped to our fridge.  Not as a set of rules but a general sort of guide to what is healthy and what we might want to try to consume.  When asked I explained things like &quot;No you don&#39;t have to eat all this everyday or only this amount. Some days you will be more hungry others less so. Just keep in mind what you have eaten over the last week or so and think about what your body might need.&quot;  When preparing meals for the family I was in the habit of talking to myself out loud and to the kids about what have we eaten today or the last week and what might we need more or less of to maintain a healthy body.  Never said you can&#39;t have that or this unless it was some else&#39;s birthday cake or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast idea look for other needs he might have that he might be trying to satisfy with food.  He might need more of something -one on one time, sports, books, snuggles, jumping whatever you might think of, games at the table- and be using food to fill that need.  If he was lacking food it could have become his comfort item like a blanky or stuffy.  It may have been the thing he needed or that satisfied his feeling of &quot;need&quot;. Perhaps he has not developed the ability transfer his feelings of &quot;need&quot; to the thing he actually &quot;needs&quot; and so when that &quot;need&quot; feeling comes up he thinks food instead of the thing that would actually fill the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would throw some suggestions out there.  It can be tough helping a little guy figure out what his body requires when his physical cues might be messed up from the inability to use them properly.  You might also want to help his develop a digestion vocabulary.  Talk about your own bodies feelings so he can think about or explain how his body might be feeling.  &quot;My tummy is so full it feels tight I think I ate too much.&quot;  &quot;When I eat too much fiber my bowels on my sides cramp and my poo comes fast..&quot; &quot;when I eat spicy foods my tummy feels all full of acid and burns.&quot;  What ever is happening give it a name and a feeling and a result and talk about how his body might react.  Creating dialog helps create awareness with out any need for the child to feel they are being accused or blamed ro shamed or what have you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust ideas feel free to toss them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      __________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAsk a question on any topic and get answers from real people.

This teenage girl is kind of a <br/>\nbigger person - tall, broad shouldered, normal weight. Her mother is <br/>\ntall, too, but very thin. Her parents are very very controlling. To the <br/>\npoint that the mother controls exactly what food goes into her mouth. I <br/>\nmean - when the girl is eating, the mother is watching and counting the <br/>\nbites. When the girl asks for more, the mother gives her a lecture about <br/>\neating too much. She refers to her as a &quot;chowhound.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girl really does think about food all the time. We went on a trip <br/>\ntogether and when the itinerary was being planned, she was always really <br/>\npanicky if it didn&#39;t include exactly when and where we were going to <br/>\neat. She could hardly think about what else there was to do if the <br/>\neating plans weren&#39;t settled first. When she&#39;s serving herself food, she <br/>\ndoes it with one eye on her mother, who indicates when she should stop. <br/>\nShe constantly asks for more and her mother sometimes gives in and <br/>\nsometimes doesn&#39;t. She always says things like, &quot;You don&#39;t need more,&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;If you must, you can have one more and that&#39;s all.&quot; When we were <br/>\ntraveling together, the mother commented several times on how much my <br/>\ngirls eat. My girls are in good shape - they&#39;re very healthy and not <br/>\noverweight or underweight. We were at a buffet and the mom stayed right <br/>\nwith her daughter and told her, &quot;One biscuit only. And you must have <br/>\nsome fruit with it.&quot; Stuff like that. My kids just picked out whatever <br/>\nthey wanted to eat, and the mom commented on their choices not being <br/>\n&quot;balanced.&quot; Rosie likes potatoes a lot - she had french fries and hash <br/>\nbrowns, both. Plus a bagel. The mom said something like, &quot;I see you&#39;re <br/>\nhaving a whole meal of carbs.&quot;  Her daughter constantly asks for more <br/>\nand absolutely always wants dessert. My kids seldom have dessert after a <br/>\nmeal, they have sweets whenever they want them, but right after eating <br/>\nisn&#39;t usually one of those times. We had a birthday party here last <br/>\nweekend and had a really delicious huge cake - and half of it was left. <br/>\nIt sat here for 3 days with little plates and forks and a cake knife <br/>\nright at hand, and the kids never touched it. They&#39;d had enough at the <br/>\nparty and didn&#39;t feel like having more cake. For her, right after a meal <br/>\nis one of the few time her mom will allow it (because she&#39;s just had <br/>\nhealthy foods, first), so she almost never fails to have dessert.

She came from a history of severe neglect and malnutrition. She<br/>\ncame home with a tummy full of parasites, and an appetite that seemed<br/>\nto never quit. We treated the parasites, but doing so could not treat<br/>\nher underlying fears around food. Fears that she would never have<br/>\n&quot;enough&quot;. She also seemed to have no &quot;off&quot; button and would eat until<br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t move, or until she vomited. She also panicked if one of<br/>\nher siblings was eating and she wasn&#39;t. If we went anywhere, her first<br/>\nquestions were always about when and where she would eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo and a half years later and she is NOT the same kid in regards to<br/>\nfood. Yes, she gained a lot of weight, but she is healthy and active<br/>\nand is just now leveling off. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what&#39;s most important, is for you to address your own fears<br/>\nbehind your child&#39;s eating. For me, my daughter&#39;s eating brought up a<br/>\nlot of my own fears from my childhood and mealtimes. I realized at one<br/>\npoint, that it was better for me to set her food in front of her,<br/>\nsmile at her, and calmly leave the room than to stay with her. She was<br/>\npicking up on my anxiousness and it was making her more anxious. I<br/>\nallowed her to eat in peace, without me hovering over her with MY fears. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe stopped regulating her eating at all. I let her eat what she wanted<br/>\nwhen she wanted. I also made sure that I was filling her &quot;love tank&quot;<br/>\nconstantly. I wanted her to associate filling up with love to get rid<br/>\nof her feelings of &quot;emptiness&quot;. We kept finger foods handy in a<br/>\ncupboard where she could reach them at anytime. We told her it was<br/>\n&quot;ok&quot; to be full and that she could eat HER foods anytime she wanted.<br/>\nWe told her over and over that there would &quot;always be food&quot;. She would<br/>\noften go to the cupboard just to open it and see if there was food<br/>\nstill in there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt broke my heart, but we stayed consistent and loving. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday she is healthy and her eating issues are mostly a thing of the<br/>\npast. I still remember the first time she left food on her plate and<br/>\nwalked away. I cried. :) I knew she had reached a place of some<br/>\nhealing. She now regularly &quot;forgets&quot; to eat or chooses to eat later<br/>\nwhen she is busy playing. She leaves food if she is full. She still<br/>\nloves to eat and still worries some, but she trusts me to care for her<br/>\nnow and is not obsessed with food as she once was. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to give you some hope. :) And hope I didn&#39;t ramble on too<br/>\nmuch! <br/>\n<br/>\ndawn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] food again","postDate":"1235545701","msgId":42486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VGQklLQUUuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvMTNzNis0ODQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42478,"nextInTopic":42490,"prevInTime":42485,"nextInTime":42487,"topicId":42462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... continue to eat until sick or told he has had enough.

What purpose would it serve to say yes to 2, but not 3? <br/>\nSometimes kids like to explore certain flavors together.  For a little<br/>\none who was deprived of food, that could be especially true.  Babies<br/>\nexplore by tasting and differentiating between what is and isn&#39;t food. <br/>\nIf that wasn&#39;t available, they are still needing to explore that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo person can teach another what is excessive or not.  It&#39;s totally<br/>\npersonal to the individual body and needs of that body.  Some kids eat a<br/>\nlot even if they were never deprived of food.  My friend&#39;s little kid,<br/>\nat the age of 3 and 4 ate twice as much food as I did for every meal. <br/>\nShe&#39;s almost 15 now and is super tall and skinny.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an adoptive parent as well and we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; brought our oldest daughter home at 18 months.

Is it by how<br/>\nthey look?  Is it by how much they weigh?  Will they really stay that<br/>\nway after a couple of years?  The child mentioned above was a huge baby<br/>\nand a very round little kid, she was extremely heavy, very solid.  She<br/>\nstill weighs a lot, but she&#39;s not overweight by any means, she very very<br/>\nthin and has a hard time finding pants tiny enough around the waist and<br/>\nstill long enough for her super long legs.  How could anyone have<br/>\npredicted that when she was 3 or 4?  There is only one other really tall<br/>\nperson in her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a really hard time accepting someone calling a little kid<br/>\noverweight, even for a year.  Kids are growing and changing all the<br/>\ntime.  One year a kid may be very round and the next they may grow tall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I saw that I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wasn&#39;t helping her to give into her every demand for food and started<br/>\n </span></blockquote>saying<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; no and helping to implement healthy choices.

A healthy 10 yr old<br/>\neating what her parents see as healthy will NOT garauntee that it will<br/>\nproduce a healthy 14 yr old happily eating what her parents deem<br/>\nhealthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI object to the idea of &quot;giving into&quot; demands of a child.  As parents,<br/>\nwe can either be their partners and help them get what they want or we<br/>\ncan set life up so that everything is doled out by the parents and<br/>\nrequested by the child and given at the parent&#39;s discretion.
