The longest eyelashes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDH bought poison for outdoor fleas instead of<br/>\ndiatamaceous earth. I already used lime (can&#39;t be too<br/>\ndifferent) and the population is reduced, but not<br/>\neliminated.  I use the (dog)lime to keep mites and<br/>\nsuch down in the chicken pen and to keep the fly<br/>\npopulation down. Gives the chickens and ducks a little<br/>\ncalcium, and neutralizes odors, too.  I put out fresh<br/>\nhay for all of the critters every few days. (They all<br/>\neat it) DH thinks it is totally unnessecary.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mind flies and odors, I guess. Or he just says<br/>\nthat so that I&#39;ll do it? Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks I couldn&#39;t go for hay so I raked up<br/>\nleaves (mostly water oak, magnolia, and sweet gum) and<br/>\nused them.  They decayed too fast under the rabbit<br/>\ncages and flies layed eggs.  Horse flies. Yuck.  I dug<br/>\nall that out and gave it to the chickens.  They<br/>\nthought it was a buffet. I am gratefull to the humble<br/>\nchickens.  They eat what I want to get rid of and give<br/>\nus wonderful huge brown eggs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe horses were jealous of the hay in the duck/rabbit<br/>\npen and kicked some holes in it.  They had LOTS of<br/>\ntheir own hay. It was just on the other side of the<br/>\nfence.  Spot, the dog, likes to eat the chicken&#39;s<br/>\ncorn, and the rabbits food.  Not becuase he likes it,<br/>\nhe is just jealous. The cats eat the horse feed.  They<br/>\nactually like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I will convert the little porch that Legs is<br/>\non to a bird aviary when he gets too big.  It<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be too hard.  Then the cockatiel can sit on<br/>\nDH&#39;s head without pooping on the speakers or getting<br/>\ndander in my coffee.  Maybe plant some stuff that the<br/>\nbird can fertilize.  I have sprouted bird seed all<br/>\nover outdoors, now.  Millet is heading.  Wonder how I<br/>\ncan do that on the porch, so that it will be like the<br/>\nzoo. Pretty and comfortable, too. The area is 5&#39;X 10&#39;<br/>\nJust right for two or so cockatiels. We have one<br/>\nlonesome female, now. They tolerate the weather here<br/>\nOK.  The breeder who gave her to Roy keeps hers in an<br/>\noutdoor (big) cage with breeding boxes.  It is<br/>\nterribly noisy.  Our bird is sweet and sings.  If she<br/>\nhas a friend I wonder if her people personality will<br/>\ndeteriorate?<br/>\n<br/>\nTorential rains nearby.
