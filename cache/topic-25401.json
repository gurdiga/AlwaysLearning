My<br/>\nds7 is a designer by nature, very sensitive to conflict and tension. His use<br/>\nof the game is the scenario designer, where he gets to build little worlds<br/>\nthat his brother sometimes plays.

I tried the &#39;play as long as you want&#39; thing but one kid would hog the computer (often to be mean to the other 2) so we sat down and talked about it together. the 3 of them decided that for a fast paced game, turn taking every hour was reasonable but for slower games like AoE then 2-3 hours was a good time length that meant all of them could get a good play during a day. This holds for me too. I get allocated time.<br/>\n  Over the years its worked pretty well although there&#39;s still arguments over whether you forfeit a turn if you leave early to watch TV or somesuch but they negotiate around the rules they set themsleves.<br/>\n  We now have 2 computers for the 6 of us which makes it a bit easier but the eldest is saving up for one now as she wants to be on MSN 24 hours a day to chat to her friends so that was ticking off the boys.<br/>\n  Most kids over 5 can negotiate these things with a parents help so that everyone is happy but if arguments start then it needs looking at again. for instance, H went back to school so the 3 of them decided it was fair that when she got in at 5pm from school (and she leaves at 7am) she gets 2 hours computer time straight away cos the boys go on all day.<br/>\n  Of course theres still some arguing because I have 4 very strong willed children who aren&#39;t wonderful at compromise but on the whole they sort it out amongst themselves now and only call on me when negotiations have stalled.<br/>\n  I reckon I could now get a job with the UN ;-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  S<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nobravery.cf.huffingtonpost.com/\">http://nobravery.cf.huffingtonpost.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwww.celyn.org<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
