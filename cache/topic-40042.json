It&#39;s become kind of  <br/>\nweird and hostile, so I thought I would share it because it&#39;s  <br/>\ninteresting in light of some recent discussions about what people  <br/>\nwant out of unschoolers.  It&#39;s long; don&#39;t read it it if gets boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve taken off an intro that said the person had read someone else&#39;s  <br/>\nunschooling site and called and talked to someone else who told her I  <br/>\nmight be able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to answer the questions in separate e-mails.  Feel free to  <br/>\ncontribute to those as they come by!  I&#39;ll blind-copy the mom who  <br/>\nasked, until she joins the list or decides she&#39;s not interested  <br/>\nanymore.  I know there are newer members of this list who honestly  <br/>\ncould use the answers to those questions.  I&#39;m willing to write out  <br/>\nanswers for groups of interested people, but one-on-one to an  <br/>\nantagonistic person seems a bad use of my time and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, unschooling is NOT for me and my family for many reasons.   <br/>\nI do believe some of the basic principles (learning is fun, children  <br/>\nlearn from modeling, etc.) however, as a whole I find that it&#39;s core  <br/>\nreally breeds self-absorption.  I don&#39;t see much evidence on any  <br/>\nwebsite that encourages values I find important for my family.  I see  <br/>\na lot of contradiction and don&#39;t really see the &quot;freedom&quot; that  <br/>\nunschoolers preach.  I see a lot of labels being used and many  <br/>\nassumed perceptions and admonishment of what is labeled as  <br/>\nmainstream.  For the record, to admonish, demean or judge anyone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s way of life really doesn&#39;t show compassion and peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, there is the legality of this way of life.  In my state, you  <br/>\nmust be a certified teacher to homeschool.  For myself, I have no  <br/>\ncollege education, therefore, to pursue this avenue I would be  <br/>\nbreaking the law.  Many others in my situation go through a facility  <br/>\ndesigned for this reason - to assist homeschoolers- but again there  <br/>\nis a curriculum decided by someone other than the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast, my questions are these:<br/>\nWhat is the difference between principles and rules?<br/>\nWhat is the course of action when principles are not followed?<br/>\nWhat is the difference between parent facilitation and a teacher?<br/>\nWhy do unschoolers negate the need for learning unless an immediate  <br/>\nneed exists?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach children to truly compromise?<br/>\nHow does catering to each child/individual teach family values?<br/>\nWhat do you recommend for families that cannot financially keep up  <br/>\nwith childrens&#39; demands?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach a child to assess a situation socially?  <br/>\nMeaning, if a child has been catered to their entire life how do they  <br/>\nlearn to give of themselves or take a passive role in a situation?<br/>\nHow does unschooling teach the vital difference between needs and wants?<br/>\nHow does unschooling prepare children for a world that is not catered  <br/>\nto their interests?<br/>\nHow does a child  from this lifestyle learn to be independent when  <br/>\nthe parent has facilitated their needs, wants and learning from day one?<br/>\nThese are just a few of the many questions I have about this  <br/>\nlifestyle.  Any time you could find to answer these would be greatly  <br/>\nappreciated.

Still  <br/>\nbelieving she wanted to know more about unschooling (even though she  <br/>\nsaid it wasn&#39;t for her), I wrote back in short informational chit- <br/>\nchatty ways, but I asked this:<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\nIn your first e-mail you wrote &quot;Honestly, unschooling is NOT for me  <br/>\nand my family for many reasons.&quot;  Why, then, are you asking [the  <br/>\nother mom] for help?  Why did you send me eleven questions, the  <br/>\nanswers to which could take many hours, if you don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nunschool?  I&#39;ll consider answering all your questions if you&#39;ll  <br/>\nanswer that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThe response is here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I didn&#39;t realize I was asking either of you for help.  I am doing  <br/>\njust fine in my &quot;mainstream&quot; world.  I simply believe that when  <br/>\npeople create websites and go on National TV as &quot;advocates&quot; for this  <br/>\nor that and claim superiority over others they should be  open to  <br/>\nanswering questions.  I asked questions because I am curious...isn&#39;t  <br/>\nthat one of your ideals of unschooling...asking questions about  <br/>\nwhatever interests someone?  However, I have found that with  <br/>\nunschooling my questions are only answered IF I want to &quot;convert&quot; or  <br/>\nI agree or am searching for an alternative to my current situation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI responded:<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think I don&#39;t answer questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion\">http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose two lists have 1800 and 1500 members.

I feel no obligation to argue  <br/>\nwith people who state that they&#39;re doing just fine and that  <br/>\nunschooling isn&#39;t for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems perhaps you have some emotional wound involving unschooling  <br/>\nand you keep scratching at it.  What&#39;s the deal?  [The other mom]  <br/>\nsays you hadn&#39;t contacted her for 18 months or so, so why did you  <br/>\nwrite to me today?  Have unschoolers been mean to you?  Do you have a  <br/>\nwebsite or something you&#39;re advocating that unschooling is thwarting  <br/>\nor disturbing?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================<br/>\nReponse:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting.  I understand you are too busy to answer any of my  <br/>\nquestions.  That&#39;s OK.  Actually, [the other mom] and I had our phone  <br/>\nconversation a while back...I hadn&#39;t counted the time to be honest.   <br/>\nHowever, we had made contact via IM over the computer more recently  <br/>\nwhere she suggested I contact you.  I had taken time to browse some  <br/>\nsites (including yours) before emailing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my emotional wounds, I have none related to unschooling.   <br/>\nInteresting jump to conclusions, though.  I am just simply curious  <br/>\nabout the lifestyle.  I didn&#39;t realize my questions involved hours of  <br/>\ndiscussion and that I needed to have a reason to ask them.   <br/>\nUnschoolers are not really accepting of anyone outside of their  <br/>\ncommunity and I find that interesting for a lifestyle that supposedly  <br/>\npromotes peace.  I find that any lifestyle lived in one end of the  <br/>\nspectrum or another can be thwarting to some degree.  What disturbs  <br/>\nme is the attitude of superiority that the Unschooling Community  <br/>\nseems to hold.  There could be some useful techniques or tips from  <br/>\nyour lifestyle I could use in my life, however, I will never know  <br/>\nsince no one will answer some basic questions.  Thank you for your  <br/>\nresponses.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============================================<br/>\n(Sandra to Always Learning again:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out, and the woman admitted it, that her first inquiries  <br/>\nwere over a year ago.  She&#39;s stuck on the questions in some unhealthy  <br/>\nway.  I&#39;m going to answer them, and I&#39;ve already sent her a link to  <br/>\nthis group.  She can reveal herself or not as she wishes, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nuncomfortable being treated in a hostile way in secret.  It seems a  <br/>\nlittle spooky and potentially unsafe.   A couple of people do know  <br/>\nwho she is, so if I&#39;m discovered ritually murdered, forward this to  <br/>\nthe police.  (I&#39;m exaggerating my fear, but weirder things have  <br/>\nhappened in the world of stalking.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions and answers next.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40058,"nextTopicId":40175}}
