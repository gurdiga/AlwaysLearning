For a few years now alot of that time has been spent with my children up with me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, in recent months, things have changed around a bit. For one, I stopped playing a video gm (Madden) all night long and stopped being on the internet all night. The other is that I have been more involved in activities with my children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyday my kids wake up looking forward to going for walks/runs, going to the playground, watching exercise tv (on direct tv- its fun for rainy cold day which we have alot of- they just run around and do their own exercises to the videos though my 5 year old son can keep up with most of the exercise instructors pretty good), going out to stores just to walk/run around, food shopping, going to the library. My daughter is 3.5 years old and will turn the tv off all the time because she would rather do arts n crafts/color with crayon and markers/paint or anything else together. My kids always request me to get off the internet or stop watching the game (im a sports junkie lol) to do activities with them. Dont get me wrong though my kids will choose to watch exercise/music stuff on tv and nick jr and stuff like that- just usually not for long.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So basically, what Im saying I guess, we are busy all day and they sleep well all night. Now when my wife says good bye for work at about 730, I have already been up, and the kids start slowly getting up on their own (usually up by 8 or 9 though my 3 year old will sleep till 10-11 sometimes).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thought- My kids also eat tons of raw and organic vegetables and fruit.

And she&#39;s fine.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was true of all my kids at that age.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I got up at 1:30 a.m. to watch the William/Catherine show.  Marty and his girlfriend (22 and 24) were awake, and another friend came over, too. We stayed up until 6:30 a.m.   I had asked Marty if Holly (19) was home.  She had taken her guitar and gone out to play music with friends, before I had gone to bed at 10:00.  He said no.  I kept waiting for her to come home--not really worried, but aware.  And we were making more noise than we might have otherwise (detached house, fair-sized lot).   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I asked Holly what time she got home, and she said 11:00 p.m.    She had been asleep through the whole thing.  She was home in bed before Marty got home from role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this story is to illustrate what young adults who never had arbitrary bedtimes can grow up to do on a random night.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-That doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t make sleep an attractive option when she <br/>\nwas little.

That was <br/>\nenough *for her* to generally go to bed at the same time we did (which <br/>\nwas usually past 10 p.m.) - being close to us. When she began <br/>\nsleeping in her own bed, she gradually changed her own rhythms to suit <br/>\nher interests and I often stayed up with her if she wanted me to. I <br/>\nstill do. I usually don&#39;t make it until 4 a.m. though, these days &lt;g&gt;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSame at our house.  When the kids were younger and we were all sharing one computer, Kirby would stay up late to play computer games, and I would get up early to do e-mail, and Marty and Holly would get their time in after they woke up and before they slept.  So Kirby would sleep late, having been up the latest.  It worked very well, and gave the kids more time with me (so that I didn&#39;t have all three awake at once), and were in various combinations with each other, and that was helpful.  Usually it was a pretty good deal to go to bed when I did, for at least one of them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sleep Schedule","postDate":"1304122405","msgId":60944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBRjE0MTQyLTdFMzQtNDMwRC1BNUM4LTdEQzE0OTVGRjhCRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltUFFLb2VnanoyMnU5YWhBQWgxdEdFazBydm5RQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwY3E1bit1dGtyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaW1aUGFTRU9RY29MNldxWkV2NHlTQXdCPXVBN0FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQjZBRDlFQy00Q0VBLTQ3RjctOTA1OC05MDUwNDIzOUJFRDlAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxCQU5Ma1RpbVBRS29lZ2p6MjJ1OWFoQUFoMXRHRWswcnZuUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60943,"nextInTopic":60945,"prevInTime":60943,"nextInTime":60945,"topicId":60893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=--=- Unschoolers are not known to be squint-eyed, pale cave dwellers. -=- -=-I don t understand the implication. are you implying that unschoolers tend to be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-433338839\">-=--=- Unschoolers are not known to be squint-eyed, pale cave dwellers. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t understand the implication. are you implying that unschoolers tend<br/>\nto be nocturnal? or stay inside? or the opposite? are they not pale because<br/>\nthey do have diurnal rhythms, or in spite of not having them?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI was saying your reaction was quite an over-reaction, as unschoolers are probably out in the world more than kids who are in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sleep Schedule","postDate":"1304122076","msgId":60943,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyMEQxODY3LTFFOTUtNEVBNS05MEVELTdFMDlDQjgyQTdERkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltUFFLb2VnanoyMnU5YWhBQWgxdEdFazBydm5RQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwY3E1bit1dGtyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaW1aUGFTRU9RY29MNldxWkV2NHlTQXdCPXVBN0FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQjZBRDlFQy00Q0VBLTQ3RjctOTA1OC05MDUwNDIzOUJFRDlAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxCQU5Ma1RpbVBRS29lZ2p6MjJ1OWFoQUFoMXRHRWswcnZuUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60942,"nextInTopic":60944,"prevInTime":60942,"nextInTime":60944,"topicId":60893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Genetics play into that. Personality does, too. Quirks like sensory issues can play a big role in the way a child chooses what to eat and what activities he or she will choose to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I hope things stay this way<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The trouble with kids, is they grow and change - and their needs change, too. Their basic temperaments stay pretty consistent, but how much they eat and what kind of food they choose tends to shift around a lot as kids go through various stages of growth and development. What interests them will likely change enormously, though, and that could be a shock to your system if you&#39;re too attached to things staying the way they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s 17 and spends a lot of time building things with wood and metal. When he was 13, he was mostly nocturnal and spent much of his time playing online role playing games. When he was 7 he liked to be inside playing board games and socializing as much as possible. When he was 4, he loved to climb. I wouldn&#39;t have guessed working with his hands would interest Ray much at 4 ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241336325,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;amyterese0303@...&gt;","profile":"amyterese0303","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Sleep Schedule","postDate":"1304118951","msgId":60938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwZmdyNytraG85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlwY3E1bit1dGtyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60937,"nextInTopic":60939,"prevInTime":60937,"nextInTime":60939,"topicId":60893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to everyone who responded.

But what I enjoy doing is leading by example and engaging them with things to do. They do not have a bed time, never have. We don&#39;t follow meal times. They eat when they are hungry and sleep when they are tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been a night owl my whole life (Im 34). I always wanted to stay up late and not miss out on anything. For a few years now alot of that time has been spent with my children up with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in recent months, things have changed around a bit. For one, I stopped playing a video gm (Madden) all night long and stopped being on the internet all night. The other is that I have been more involved in activities with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryday my kids wake up looking forward to going for walks/runs, going to the playground, watching exercise tv (on direct tv- its fun for rainy cold day which we have alot of- they just run around and do their own exercises to the videos though my 5 year old son can keep up with most of the exercise instructors pretty good), going out to stores just to walk/run around, food shopping, going to the library. My daughter is 3.5 years old and will turn the tv off all the time because she would rather do arts n crafts/color with crayon and markers/paint or anything else together. My kids always request me to get off the internet or stop watching the game (im a sports junkie lol) to do activities with them. Dont get me wrong though my kids will choose to watch exercise/music stuff on tv and nick jr and stuff like that- just usually not for long.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically, what Im saying I guess, we are busy all day and they sleep well all night. Now when my wife says good bye for work at about 730, I have already been up, and the kids start slowly getting up on their own (usually up by 8 or 9 though my 3 year old will sleep till 10-11 sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought- My kids also eat tons of raw and organic vegetables and fruit. My 5 year old son would take a banana or apple over candy any day (not so much my daughter but she is a bit younger). Today we ate big thing of snow peas and grape tomatoes :). They did have cereal earlier though before that. When we go to the supermarket they pick out whatever foods they want. Mangoes and star fruit are my sons favorite. I guess because this is how we eat, they honestly dont choose much candy or cookies at all (though my 3 year old does so more often :).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its because they are so young that they want to be out all the time and love doing stuff other than sitting in front of screens. Maybe the healthy eating combined with the physical activities help, i don&#39;t know, but I hope things stay this way. Granted I am doing all this with a 6 month old so I dont get much sleep myself lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Apr 29, 2011, at 2:16 PM, Rod Thomas wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why does it bother us?

I ask because my girls (6 & 9) have been going through periods of being up all night. If there is something that we want to do during the day, we plan ahead and work out the sleeping so that we can do whatever it is that we want. The last couple of weeks we went back to a more traditional sleep schedule so they could play with their cousins and do some daytime outings. After a week or two of that, we sat down and talked about it because they were getting cranky and grumpy. My girls flat out told me that they would rather stay home and do their thing at home than do the work of getting up and going places. Their rationale was that they don&#39;t like that when we go out and do stuff they have to behave accordingly. When we are out, there are limitations on what they can or can&#39;t do depending on where we are going. My girls know that when they play with cousins they are treated like little kids and they don&#39;t get to have much of a say in what goes on. They enjoy playing with the cousins but they know that they will not be taken seriously. When they get tired of that, we take a break. My 6 year old has said, &quot;I would rather stay home and get to be myself.&quot; My girls see home as a place that is emotionally and physically safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":331885657,"authorName":"Jennifer Schuelein","from":"&quot;Jennifer Schuelein&quot; &lt;fairiedust66@...&gt;","profile":"jenfromtx6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sleep Schedule, up all night","postDate":"1304107157","msgId":60924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwZjVhbCtpdnFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2QTRBQTE1M0U5RDQ3NzM5NUQ4N0EwMDEzRDFBNzU4QE1PTXNQQz4="},"prevInTopic":60923,"nextInTopic":60925,"prevInTime":60923,"nextInTime":60925,"topicId":60893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think part of this is societal conditioning.

We are told what is &quot;right&quot; our whole lives. When to eat, sleep and play. As unschoolers, my family has abandoned these societal conditions. I am a night owl and my son showed me his natural night owl tendencies early. I don&#39;t see the fact that I feel more productive and happier at night as a bad thing. I often feel drowsy all day, but energized and ready to thrive at night. I realize that the outside world is only open during daylight hours so it really is a hard thing to manage sometimes. My son and I agree to go to bed earlier and get up earlier if we have a special outing planned. He has to want to go to the outing, though and I let him choose if we go or not. Since we are so similar, we agree together when we will make a change to our schedule so we can go to the museum or to a show. For us, it&#39;s all about balance. For me personally my main goal is that my son is a happy, loving, intelligent and good person when he arrives at adulthood. He is all of these things now already so I think I&#39;m doing well! As far as being educated, he is also doing great and we stay at home mostly. We watch a lot of educational DVD&#39;s and plan a few outings a month, which are very fun and Xander often looks forward to them for weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach child is different. Each home is different. Letting go of societal expectations to some extent really does help make things harmonious for our family. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rod Thomas&quot; &lt;rthomas314@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;.I wasn&#39;t thrilled to be honest when my son went through a patch<br/>\n&gt; of this, however it really didn&#39;t matter and it stopped after about 3<br/>\n&gt; weeks<br/>\n&gt; without me doing anything about it... but the ALL night awake did bother<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sallyanne&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Why does it bother us?

Their naps happened when they were sleepy, and their nighttime sleep was with an adult or two, and when they were tired.  It worked really well for us.  When we started unschooling and I got involved in discussions and people said &quot;How do you make them go to sleep?&quot; I said &quot;we don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are stories collected here of people who calmed themselves and let sleep happen naturally.  A five year old isn&#39;t &quot;making a decision for her body.&quot;  Her body isn&#39;t separate from herself.  If she has the option to go to sleep or stay awake, she will do what seems most beneficial to her in the moment, and again the next moment, and practicing on safe things at home that way, when she&#39;s older she will be able to make big decisions more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleep\">http://sandradodd.com/sleep</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A five year old can&#39;t make that decision for her body through logic.<br/>\nIt is biological.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a lot of people are looking at lately is a sleep cycle of four hours, some awake time, and another sleep session.

It&#39;s easy to  <br/>\nassign a number on a line to kids&#39; access to alcohol in the home on a  <br/>\nscale from Forbidden to Don&#39;t bother me. What can be quantified then  <br/>\nseems important. And the &quot;other things&quot; that are more vague seem less  <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschooling parents find is that it&#39;s the relationship they have  <br/>\nwith their kids -- more importantly whether the kids feel trusted,  <br/>\nsupported respected in who they are and what they want -- that is the  <br/>\nprimary factor in them making thoughtful decisions in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quality of the relationship between parents and kids isn&#39;t easy to  <br/>\nquantify. What factors of the relationship would a researcher choose  <br/>\nto rank as being significant and which would they discount? How would  <br/>\na researcher determine their ranking objectively?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is likely to make the results of such an attempt worth very  <br/>\nlittle is that the factors that are important for conventional  <br/>\nparenting -- eg, children&#39;s compliance with parents&#39; agenda for them  <br/>\n-- actually tear down relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A big part of parenting is controlling who your<br/>\n&gt; children spend time with; an impossible task in school situations, but<br/>\n&gt; automatic in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can&#39;t be a big part if it&#39;s impossible, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nA big part of unschooling is creating a relationship where kids feel  <br/>\nsupported, trusted and respected for who they are (rather than who the  <br/>\nparents believe they could be.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat tears at relationships -- between parents and kids, between adult  <br/>\nfriends, between spouses -- is control. The idea of &quot;I know what&#39;s  <br/>\nbest for you better than you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, controlling who children spend time with is not automatic.  <br/>\nBeing their partner in helping them find friends they enjoy spending  <br/>\ntime with will work far better than controlling who they spend time  <br/>\nwith. It may on the surface look the same, but inside the child the  <br/>\ntwo will feel very different. Inside the child help will feel like  <br/>\nlove and support. Control will feel like closed doors which increases  <br/>\nthe desire to go through them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So even if unschoolers are &quot;permissive&quot;, they may<br/>\n&gt; create a social atmosphere for their children where peer pressure  <br/>\n&gt; supports<br/>\n&gt; good decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Being permissive isn&#39;t a good concept for unschooling. It also isn&#39;t a  <br/>\ngood word to use for what unschoolers do since it muddies what&#39;s  <br/>\nreally happening. Permissive suggests disengagement, detachment,  <br/>\nleaving kids to their own devices, letting them do whatever they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about greater engagement with kids than conventional  <br/>\nparenting. It&#39;s about connecting with kids to support who they are,  <br/>\nsupport their interests, help them explore the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids being allowed to enjoy wine with the family is not at all the  <br/>\nsame as being permissive. The only quality they share is whether or  <br/>\nnot the parents allow the kids to have alcohol. All the important  <br/>\nfactors that build a healthy relationship with alcohol don&#39;t exist  <br/>\nunder the &quot;Permissive&quot; label.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t have a teenager yet, and I&#39;m actually less concerned<br/>\n&gt; about alcohol than marijuana, which can bias a young brain toward  <br/>\n&gt; mental<br/>\n&gt; health issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you read the article about the Rat Park studies at the link that  <br/>\nwas posted before.

I wasn&#39;t thrilled to be honest  when my son went through a patch<br/>\nof this, however it really didn&#39;t matter and it stopped after about 3 weeks<br/>\nwithout me doing anything about it... but the ALL night awake did bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSallyanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241336325,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;amyterese0303@...&gt;","profile":"amyterese0303","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Sleep Schedule","postDate":"1304030199","msgId":60893,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwY3E1bit1dGtyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60898,"prevInTime":60892,"nextInTime":60894,"topicId":60893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Quick background: We started unschooling in October 2010, but were living with people who embraced traditional parenting until mid-March, at which time we were","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-635804945\">Quick background: We started unschooling in October 2010, but were living with people who embraced traditional parenting until mid-March, at which time we were able to get our own place. While living with the other family, our 5yo dd (Zoe) had restrictions on tv watching. She also had to be in our room by a certain time every night, so she would not disturb the other family, since they worked and went to school. We didn&#39;t have a tv in our room, but she was able to watch videos on the computer until she chose to go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince our move to our own place, she has begun to stay up all night watching tv. (Could we still be deschooling?) Because of her new schedule, dh and I stay up as late as we can so we get to spend time with her. When we get tired - usually around 3am, we go to sleep. She would rather I stay up with her, but I just can&#39;t seem to manage it.  She knows that if she needs anything, she can come get me. <br/>\n<br/>\nZoe goes to sleep between 8-10am and wakes up between 7-9pm. Then she spends some time snuggling with me and we play games, pretend, etc. By the time she is ready (physically, mentally, emotionally) to go somewhere it&#39;s usually too late to do the types of things she wants to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m posting today because my dh and I were talking about it and are trying to decide what (if anything) we should do. I&#39;m not sure if we should just continue as we are or if it would be better for Zoe if I start waking her up so we can do some of the fun things she wants to do. At 5yo I&#39;m not sure if she understands that in order to go to these places, she would need to go to bed earlier, even though I&#39;ve explained it to her. Also, what if she says she wants to do something, but when it&#39;s time to get up she says she&#39;d rather sleep more? <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is obviously happy watching tv all night. But I don&#39;t want her to NOT be able to do the other things that she wants to do. I want to be her partner in finding what makes her happy. I am a SAHM, so should I modify my sleep schedule to match hers? And what should I do about finding things for her to do in the evening? There doesn&#39;t seem to be much for a 5yo to do out of the house after 10pm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight or other ways of thinking about this would really be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62878,"nextTopicId":62820}}
