Michelle is 14 now and has  <br/>\ndefinite preferences of what she wants to do and think about. They  <br/>\ndon&#39;t always have much to do with things we did when she was younger.  <br/>\nHowever, one constant for her has been a fascination with animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat early interest has evolved into a huge collection of stuffed  <br/>\nanimals, computer games (Zoo Tycoon, Impossible Creatures) clay  <br/>\nsculpture of animals, horse riding, playing a hunter in World of  <br/>\nWarcraft (because they have pets &lt;g&gt;), reading novels that feature  <br/>\nanimals (Warriors, Guardians of Ga&#39;hoole, Silverwing series),  <br/>\ncollecting Zoobooks, watching Animal Planet, and delving into anime  <br/>\nand manga that have an animal focus, just to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s learned to read, type, spell and punctuate correctly; to read  <br/>\nmaps; to sculpt beautifully; to add, subtract, figure out percentages  <br/>\nand estimates; to appreciate music (the Broadway version of The Lion  <br/>\nKing&#39;s songs and the music written and performed expressly for games  <br/>\nlike WoW, for example); to learn some Japanese; and to host funshops  <br/>\nat conferences, all as a result of that continuing interest. But it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot all in-depth or even about knowledge (though there&#39;s that, too).  <br/>\nIt&#39;s about what makes life fun and happy for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I facilitated her love of animal stuff, because it&#39;s led her  <br/>\nin so many directions, some of which I didn&#39;t expect. I could have  <br/>\ntried to funnel her into being a vet or volunteering at shelters or a  <br/>\nstarting a dog-walking service. I see many parents trying to turn  <br/>\ntheir child&#39;s passion into something &quot;worthwhile.&quot; But, I think it  <br/>\nwould have limited her if I&#39;d put her in a &quot;this is what animal lovers  <br/>\ndo&quot; box. She&#39;s taken it where she wanted it to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: does it matter?","postDate":"1236959070","msgId":43144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxNEQ0Qjk0LTVBQTYtNEU2MS1CN0I5LTMzNDA3Q0NGOUZGQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdwY2JlNCtiMjlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdwY2JlNCtiMjlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43140,"nextInTopic":43145,"prevInTime":43143,"nextInTime":43145,"topicId":43132,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m continually surprised with the depth of knowledge the skimmer has, and the breadth of knowledge the diver has.
