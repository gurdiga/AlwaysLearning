If you live by a pond or<br/>\nstream that&#39;s even better. <br/>\nFabric can be really interesting and different kinds of paper and even<br/>\npictures from magazines.  <br/>\nIf they like make up that might be cool.  I&#39;ve never looked, but I hear<br/>\nlipstick has fish scales in it ( is that true?)  so you could go on a<br/>\nfish scale hunt.  ( can you se them?)  THAT&#39;S gross! <br/>\nCarolina Biological supply has a cool forensics kit, it&#39;s classroom size,<br/>\nbut when I asked them to they sold us a scaled down version.  Edmund<br/>\nScientific has really nice prepared slides.  Well, the textile slides<br/>\nare, anyway.  <br/>\nMoldy bread is cool.  We find neat stuff when I clean out the &#39;fridge.  <br/>\nYeast is fun.  ( bread yeast that is )<br/>\nFruit. <br/>\nMaybe raw meat?
