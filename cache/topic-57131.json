I suppose I am defining &quot;failure&quot; in a schoolish way. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut my main point there was the irony of the education expert of all people saying &quot;failure is good and useful&quot; when in school situations failure can be a disaster and is something to avoid. Plus there was a thing that they would be learning teamwork etc skills that they could then *bring to school*. :p~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like in the wider world, or at least the media, nothing children do is seen out of the context of how it will effect their school lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Or perhaps it was just to reassure the parents that their kids weren&#39;t wasting time in trivia. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big news was that kids can make decisions for themselves about what to do, and work together to common goals. (Alert the media - oh wait, they did.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I took from the item was how ALL kids could thrive as unschoolers, if only the parents were willing and able.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s a cool park, and Jayn would have adored it, maybe still would. The kids all looked blissful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
