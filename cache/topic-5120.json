My sister married a millionaire (no kidding), the kind with a trust fund and stocks in the company, and he&#39;s set for life and he doesn&#39;t work at all. They had a huge house (about 4,000 sq. ft) but they just built their dream house. It&#39;s over 12,000 sq. ft, up on the side of a mountain with a view, a negative edge pool, 2 jacuzzis, an elaborate home theater room, and even an elevator (why? for the heck of it!), and they aren&#39;t planning on ever having kids. All this is just for the 2 of them. They NEVER host business parties and my BIL is actually quite a recluse and very private. Why did they build this house? Well, it is customed designed just for them and it has all the things they ever wanted in it. They have the money and they use it to please themselves with the certain things they buy and have. They don&#39;t travel. I should mention, though, that for all this money, my BIL is going blind and no amount of money will buy his eyesight back. It&#39;s very sad. He&#39;s only in his early 40&#39;s. I always think that it&#39;s so ironic this way that LIFE has a way of balancing everybody out naturally, whether you are rich or poor. And just because you are a millionaire doesn&#39;t mean you are rich. I&#39;m sure he would trade all of his money to get his eyesight back right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably isn&#39;t typcial of all millionaires, I&#39;m sure. Most probably buy big houses to show off to other people. But I&#39;d bet that MOST millionaires are just NOT typical people to begin with.

From some of the more outspoken<br/>\nopponents to government programs here in CA, I&#39;ve read some very strongly <br/>\nfear based articles.  Cathy something-or-other (I&#39;m spacing her last<br/>\nname, she used to be CHN&#39;s webmaster) wrote an article about<br/>\nhow the government preys on homeschoolers just like the predators<br/>\nin Africa prey on the wildlife there.  Maybe she was just trying<br/>\nto scare her readers into joining in her crusade; maybe she actually<br/>\nbelieves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that (again amongst the ones here in CA) in their worldview<br/>\nthe ultimate evil is government control.  I&#39;ve met Chris Cardiff and<br/>\nhis family IRL.  Chris is strongly opposed to government control in<br/>\neducation.  Yet his daughters are not unschooled.  For you, me and <br/>\nprobably the other members of this list, control as administered in<br/>\nany school setting is the ultimate evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been my experience.  I bought into their thinking too, until<br/>\nI moved here in November, 2000.  I spent a lot of time agonizing over<br/>\nmy decision to join the local charter program.  I kept thinking &quot;how<br/>\ncould I sell out homeschooling?&quot;  But when I looked at the program<br/>\nand the alternatives and I realized that I&#39;d be &quot;selling out&quot; my children<br/>\nby not joining this program.  It is a great community resource.  We<br/>\njoined about 1 year ago.  I do have more paperwork to do than if we&#39;d<br/>\nremained independent.  It&#39;s been great and we&#39;ve met a lot of really<br/>\nneat unschooling families in this program.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO it&#39;s the fear, anger, and the personal attacks that is more of a <br/>\nproblem than the purity of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 200 members, and a philosophical question","postDate":"1014572568","msgId":5146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDIyNDA5MzgxNi4wMmM1ZjdiMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdlLjIzNDNhZTEyLjI5YWE2OTlhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5145,"nextInTopic":5147,"prevInTime":5145,"nextInTime":5147,"topicId":5120,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At least the<br/>\n&gt;reasons people criticize these things are vastly different.  Personally, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;supportive of homeschoolers whether they accept state funding or not.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;known families for whom that was the best way.  But, as Joyce pointed out,<br/>\n&gt;the criticism for that comes from the very real threat that once you accept<br/>\n&gt;monies from the government, the government expects to have a hand in telling<br/>\n&gt;you how to use that money and then we start slipping down that slope of overt<br/>\n&gt;governmental control of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the argument I keep hearing.

Maybe it&#39;s a political one, which <br/>\nis why I&#39;m confused.   <br/>\n<br/>\nClearly different homeschoolers have different motives and boundaries.  Some <br/>\nseem to want to disprove and undo the compulsory attendance laws.   Some want <br/>\nfreedom from government control (good luck with that one, longterm...).  Some <br/>\nwant some degree of isolation for social, religious, dietary or safety <br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne argument that has been presented to me, personally, over the years is <br/>\nthat we (homeschoolers) need to be a unified group, that we&#39;re all in this <br/>\ntogether, that we have to support the rights of all homeschoolers.  That <br/>\nsounds good in a pep-rally way, but it has always seemed to me that <br/>\nconservative school-at-home homeschooling is 180 degrees from what I want and <br/>\ndo and believe, with school halfway between us.  They leave because school is <br/>\ntoo permissive, teaches too broad a set of information.   I&#39;m out because <br/>\nschool is so restrictive, and teaches so narrow a set of information.  So <br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen myself the same as, or in the same category as, those who use <br/>\nABeka or Sonlight or anything super-structured and punish children for <br/>\n&quot;homeschooling&quot; infractions and &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;low grades.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSoem of the objections (not just in this issue of HEM, but in online <br/>\ndiscussions from time to time) seem to have to do with whether someone else <br/>\nis telling the family what and how to teach.  Some seem to deal more with the <br/>\nfamily&#39;s freedom of schedule and movement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is why subscribing to a &quot;homeschool&quot; that involves <br/>\nparents teaching per directions and sending the tests and assignments back to <br/>\nthe company for grading or comment or whatever is considered homeschooling <br/>\n(whether it&#39;s A Beka or Clonlara), while unschooling while signed up with an <br/>\nalternative school program is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy jump on an unschooler who has accepted state funding, but NOT jump on <br/>\nsomeone who paid $800 or $1000 for someone else to tell them exactly what to <br/>\ndo?<br/>\n<br/>\nI care more about how people learn than about what they&#39;re taking from teh <br/>\ngovernment or not.  If I believed school methods worked, I&#39;d probably send my <br/>\nkids to school.  I think school methods can be harmful to children and their <br/>\nfamilies, and those children&#39;s future children.  So why (if it is, as it <br/>\nseems to me) are families who school MORE like school than school does <br/>\nsupposed to be my partners and cohorts, while those who don&#39;t school <br/>\nschool-style are bad guys for signing up with a charter school or umbrella or <br/>\nspecial program?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve complained about the Family School here in Albuquerque, but again it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause of methods.  I hate for them to call it &quot;half-time homeschooling&quot; <br/>\nwhen that half time is prescribed assignments and homework which the parents <br/>\nhave to chart and document.  And if kids miss school or parents miss the <br/>\nrequired weekly meetings, the child is dumped in favor of someone else on the <br/>\nmailing list.  If Albuquerque Public Schools had an unschoolers&#39; help center <br/>\nwith people advising families and teaching them to unschool, I wouldn&#39;t care <br/>\nif they got full state, federal and add-on-special-ed funding for every one <br/>\nof them, as long as they let them learn however they wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is just a perspective problem, like looking at a ribbon.
