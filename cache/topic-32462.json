Sometimes she does and she has a good <br/>\nsuggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Sandra about the failure to fulfil an obligation that they <br/>\napparently had agreed to, being an issue worth mentioning. I wonder if it <br/>\nwould be better coming from your dh than from you. We have a kind of <br/>\nunspoken agreement here, he speaks to his mom when she questions  our <br/>\nunschooling, and I deal with misunderstandings on the part of my stepfather <br/>\n(who knows zip about children since I was 18 when he married my mother.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a while since I wrote about this, but I just remembered and it <br/>\nmight be useful to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my mother was alive, she was pretty vocal in her massive ignorance <br/>\nabout just about everything to do with attachment parenting, breast feeding <br/>\nand education. It was tempting to send her everything I could find for her <br/>\nto read. However I found what was useful was to send her information from <br/>\nthe kind of conservative sources that she was more likely to respect. For <br/>\nexample an article by Dr. Brazelton was much more likely to be read and <br/>\naccepted by her than the *very same information* written up in Mothering <br/>\nMagazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you MIL would respect information from reputable (in her eyes) <br/>\nacademic sources about multiple intelligences, child development, and <br/>\nalternative education including deliberately delaying academics. I am <br/>\nthinking of some carefully chosen snippets by writers familiar to mainstream <br/>\naudiences such as Piaget or even Montessori.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Hubby and ds 8 stayed home.  We left on Thursday so I<br/>\nmade arrangements for ds to stay at my MIL&#39;s house while hubby was at<br/>\nwork.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had issues w/ MIL before calling my hubby and saying things<br/>\nabout homeschooling but I always assumed she would not say or do<br/>\nanything to the children.  I know, my mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS 8 is not reading yet, and apparently she was having him write and<br/>\ndrilling him on his ABC&#39;s.  He went along with this because I am sure<br/>\nhe was trying to make his grandparents happy. MIL called my hubby the<br/>\nnext day and told him how concerned she was and that he can&#39;t even<br/>\nwrite his last name and that maybe he&#39;s dyslexic.  Hubby pretty much<br/>\njust heard her out and told her we weren&#39;t worried and hung up (that<br/>\npretty much sums up hubby and her relationship).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had also bought tickets to a play for the 3 of them (ds, mil and<br/>\nfil) but they decided not to take him.  I had asked if they would take<br/>\nhim at least a month a go and would have made other arrangements if<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to.  She&#39;s a control freak and again, it was my<br/>\nmistake for leaving him there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my question is for this list, is what would you say to ds??  I<br/>\ntold him that I was sorry they did that and I would not leave him<br/>\nthere w/out one of us again.  I told him that people read at different<br/>\ntimes and that he is starting to read and that it will just click.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t want him to feel like he&#39;s not smart (I don&#39;t know if he<br/>\ndoes feel like this).  But hubby said he was spent Thursday night,<br/>\ncrying at his b-ball game saying it was cause he missed me (this isn&#39;t<br/>\nhow he would normally react).<br/>\n<br/>\nToday MIL sent me an email telling me how wonderful ds is and how good<br/>\nhe makes her feel.  I&#39;d like to respond how glad I am for her and does<br/>\nshe know she makes him feel like crap??  Of course she didn&#39;t mention<br/>\nher &quot;concerns&quot; to me, but then again she never does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso this did place a twing of doubt in hubby&#39;s mind, for the reason<br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t want ds to feel less than because he&#39;s not reading.  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;ve smoothed that out, but I tried to click on a link Sandra<br/>\nhad posted on multiple intelligences but it didn&#39;t work.  I&#39;d like to<br/>\ntry that again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly my concern is saying/doing the right thing for my son.  I will<br/>\nnever leave ds with them again, and I know I probably can&#39;t change<br/>\nthem.  So, should I even bother saying anything to her?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for the advice,<br/>\namy in iowa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32498,"nextTopicId":32505}}
