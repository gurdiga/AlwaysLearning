But civil libertarians are calling the new policy elitist, and<br/>\n&gt; students complain it violates their right to graduate before an audience<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; parents and friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; said Kassie Finch, who said she got a letter of<br/>\n&gt; acceptance from Pierce College so she can participate in the ceremony<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; will likely work at her mother&#39;s law office after graduation. &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure<br/>\n&gt; if I&#39;m going to college or not.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Initial estimates show that up to 95 percent of District C seniors have<br/>\n&gt; made a post-secondary commitment this year. Last year, without the<br/>\n&gt; policy,<br/>\n&gt; 54 percent took that step.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The policy basically says to our community that we hold very high<br/>\n&gt; expectations of our graduates,&quot; said District C Superintendent Robert<br/>\n&gt; Collins. &quot;Is the policy harsh? I don&#39;t think so at all. A harsh policy<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; when we ignore youngsters.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
