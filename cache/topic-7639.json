He&#39;s 13 now, but addresses and strings of numbers <br/>\ntend to jumble up in his brain. He can still tell you our old address <br/>\nthough.

He looked at me for it and Casey blurted it out. The woman <br/>\nactally made a comment to Conor that he should really know that information. <br/>\n:-P I&#39;m sure he could have thought of it if given a moment. It was just <br/>\neasier to get it from me at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, he crashed this past winter while snowboarding solo at the local <br/>\nresort. Even with a slight concussion, he was able to answer all of the ski <br/>\npatrol&#39;s questions. When it really counts, he can take care of himself. (BTW <br/>\nhe was fine after that crash.
