It makes it harder for  <br/>\nthem to think, in general, but it makes it easier for them not to  <br/>\ndwell on the hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose with fewer hurts remember more.  That&#39;s good to remember with  <br/>\nparenting, too!  If you want your children to be able to access lots  <br/>\nof information, keep them happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults who consciously play with ideas and connections won&#39;t &quot;learn  <br/>\nto weed out&quot; information, they&#39;ll learn to USE it, all of it, all  <br/>\nkinds of new ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little we played a game I called &quot;gambling.&quot;  I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t say &quot;Do you want to play that thing?&quot;  I&#39;d say &quot;Let&#39;s gamble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had to have money to gamble, and so they&#39;d bring pennies and  <br/>\nnickles and I would too, and we&#39;d have wooden bowls or some  <br/>\ncontainers, and we&#39;d always play on my bed.  I&#39;d get those sets of  <br/>\ncards that are by grade and have school categories, and I&#39;d go to the  <br/>\nnext page every time (they&#39;re bound with one rivet/screw thing on one  <br/>\nend) and choose one that would be a little hard but not impossible.   <br/>\nWe&#39;d go through all the kids, usually oldest to youngest, but  <br/>\nsometimes we&#39;d rotate, or I&#39;d offer it to the kid who hadn&#39;t won  <br/>\nlately or who might know it because of some recent thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kid knew it, he got a penny.  If not, I got a penny.  If it  <br/>\nwas unknowable because they&#39;d never ever heard of it, no pennies were  <br/>\nexchanged.  Great answers got two pennies.  Pointing out a flaw in  <br/>\nthe question got a penny.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just played fast and for fun and there was a lot of laughter.   <br/>\nOften there would be a globe on the bed, and a map and maybe a  <br/>\ncalculator or something else by the end of it, and when it stopped  <br/>\nbeing fun for someone, we&#39;d all quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey always won.<br/>\nAnd I always found out some things they knew that surprised me, and I  <br/>\nwas able to discover some things I might want to make more available  <br/>\nto them.    That&#39;s part of how I knew what to strew.  I haven&#39;t told  <br/>\nthis story for a long time, maybe since before I was collecting web  <br/>\npages. &lt;g&gt;  I should put it out there...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t go with the subject categories, but just randomized it all  <br/>\nand treated it all like one giant category, mostly.  I remember  <br/>\navoiding the spelling stuff, because even when they knew LOTS of math  <br/>\nand geography and history, they still couldn&#39;t spell.

When a social studies question came up they were both excided and said they love social studies.  I was wondering how they even knew what social studies were.  I&#39;ve never mentioned it and as far as I knew, since they are always with me, that they had never been around anyone else discussing social studies.  They said they play it on their turbo twists.  And they were right, they knew all the social studies questions.  I had no idea they knew all that stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we get to a science question and it is about rocks.  We are working on a rock project right now where we exchange rocks with others from the US and Canada to learn about and collect different types of rocks.  So we have been studying rocks.  I &quot;taught&quot; the kids the different types of rocks.  Just last week they &quot;learned&quot; about sedimentary rocks, so when the question came up, I was sure that they would know.  Well, they hadn&#39;t &quot;learned&quot; it.............and neither had I!  I missed the question too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my husband came into the room (he is the one against homeschooling) and he said that I should have missed it, but the kids should have been right.  I was very confused.  He said that adults have learned to weed out the information in their brains that they don&#39;t need.  I asked why he thinks kids don&#39;t do that too.  He said that kids need to know it.     ??????????????????????????  WHAT?????<br/>\nThat was the end of our discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought it was neat to see what kind of things kids really pick up on and remember.  They have a reason to know all the social studies so that the next time it comes up on turbo twist they will get it right.  They don&#39;t need to know the types of rocks, nor do I, because we are more interested in how they look than how they were created.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anyone doesnt have it, Are you smarter than a fifth grader is a really fun game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmony</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30999,"nextTopicId":31012}}
