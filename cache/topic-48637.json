","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-20137800\">Hello Everyone!<br/>\nI would like to thank you all very much for your input on my previous <br/>\nquestions about finances, television, etc, that Sandra posted for me.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading... and that more I read of your responses, then more I <br/>\nrealize that I didn&#39;t say what I meant AT ALL!!  Its amazing how we have <br/>\nlittle problems, little difficulties in day-to-day living, and somehow I <br/>\nend up trying to &#39;encapsulate&#39; them, to get an idea across quickly, <br/>\nshortly, and instead I end up making generalized, or untrue statements <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t even agree with on further reflection.  When I was writing <br/>\nabout the &#39;junk&#39; on TV, and &#39;junk&#39; food... I was referring to very <br/>\nspecific aspects of TV, in my own mind, from my own experience watching <br/>\nvery particular shows.  I can see it sounded like I was referring to all <br/>\nTV, making a judgement, and that wasn&#39;t my intention.  When I wrote &#39;we&#39; <br/>\nstatements, I think I was thinking of my husband and I, and not <br/>\nincluding my children, but that says something about me, to not include <br/>\nmy children in statements that reflect the reality of our family <br/>\nchoices!  Instead of rewriting what I wrote, in the way that I meant <br/>\nit... I&#39;m just going to start asking real questions, based on real <br/>\ndifficulties I encounter as we try to move from the baby/toddler level <br/>\nof parenting to the 3 years old and up age.  I read a lot when my 3 year <br/>\nold was a baby, I had so much more time, but my mind was applying it to <br/>\nbabies, not toddlers or preschoolers (is there another word for this age <br/>\ngroup that does not involve schooling?), and I think I need to <br/>\nre-evaluate my preconcieved ideas about this age, so as to be the kind <br/>\nof parent I was planning to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now my mind has blanked, about the real issues.  So please, stay <br/>\ntuned... hopefully I&#39;ll remember some of what I think about when I&#39;m <br/>\nnursing and can&#39;t get to the computer to write it down! <br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48617,"nextTopicId":48648}}
