He had <br/>\nreal lemonade (as opposed to powdered mixes), ice and even lemon  and lime <br/>\nwedges (which didn&#39;t go over well at all) to dress them up. Teen gals  just <br/>\n&quot;aww!&quot; ed over him and lots of folks gave him tips and one lady even gave  him the <br/>\nprice of a cup plus a tip but didn&#39;t like lemonade! When it got  cooler, he <br/>\ntried a cider and donut stand (we&#39;re on a main route for kids walking  home <br/>\nfrom the high school), but for some reason didn&#39;t do as well. As we were  setting <br/>\nup the cider stand, though, a man pulled up and bought $5 worth of  donuts <br/>\nbecause he likes to help young entrepreneurs wherever he can! I thought  that <br/>\nwas pretty cool. His profit from the lemonade stand (after supplies) was  $25 <br/>\n(over 4 weeks-we had our own stand at the local farmer&#39;s market and he sat  his <br/>\nup next to us).<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard lots of other suggestions on groups (maybe an  archive search <br/>\nmight turn something up?), but this is what we&#39;ve tried that  worked fairly well <br/>\nfor Wyl.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************One site has it all.
