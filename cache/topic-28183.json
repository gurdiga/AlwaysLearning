Her &quot;self regulation&quot; is close <br/>\nenough to your expectation wrt dvs and food as to be within your <br/>\ncomfort zone. What happens when she wants to &quot;regulate&quot; at a level <br/>\nthat is *outside* your comfort zone?

For example, my dd is really <br/>\nvisual and physical, so explaining with words doesn&#39;t work well with <br/>\nher - but I still do it on occasion! Bad habit on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought goes back to the ideas about expectations and the <br/>\nsubjectivity of &quot;consumerism&quot; - maybe instead of trying to explain <br/>\nyou need to be working on discovering what *her* thoughts and <br/>\nfeelings are. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and new things just get spread throughout the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like expectations on your part - why shouldn&#39;t new <br/>\nthings get spread throughout the house? Hidden under furniture and <br/>\nin the backs of closets? Maybe the idea of living in a giant <br/>\ntreasure hunt is appealing to your dd on some visceral level - think <br/>\nabout it as a twist on &quot;strewing&quot;. Much as I love the idea of my <br/>\nhouse as a museum:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/museum\">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI confess it looks more like a rummage sale most of the time - but <br/>\ngosh I love a good rummage sale!

Mo&#39;s like that, but <br/>\nshe also tends to forget and mislay things, so from time to time <br/>\nI&#39;ve used play money so that she can see and hold the number <br/>\nof &quot;dollars&quot; available for spending, but I don&#39;t have to worry about <br/>\nit getting lost. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo also sometimes needs to see quantities to understand how things <br/>\nget divided up - especially now that my stepson is living here and <br/>\nwe have to divide things 4 ways when before it was only 3. Last <br/>\nnight we made piles of cookies, for example, but I&#39;ve also done it <br/>\nin the store with fingers or bills in my wallet, or whatever comes <br/>\nto hand, so she can see how I&#39;m trying to meet everyone&#39;s spending <br/>\nwants at once within our budget.

We have moved to RU since last year and  <br/>\nenjoying the journey :)<br/>\n<br/>\nour 5yr old dd has generally achieved what i would call a &quot;sense of  <br/>\nbalance&quot; in dvds, food and sleep times and almost everything else.  <br/>\n*Except* on the question of buying things...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like every trip out is an opportunity to buy something. We  <br/>\nhave been going along with this by:<br/>\n- buying if it is &quot;affordable&quot; (obviously if we have not got the  <br/>\nmoney or its v expensive there are real limits)<br/>\n- getting it from an alternative cheaper option where possible,  <br/>\nmainly ebay (led to our dd walking into a toy shop, picking up a toy  <br/>\nand shouting to me across it &quot;hey dad, can we get this cheaper on the  <br/>\ncomputer?&quot; LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we do this we try to strike a balance of discussing issues of  <br/>\nbudget, money & value while not judging what she wants to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts/ issues related to this:<br/>\n<br/>\n- we (the parents) feel that a sense of abundance is an important  <br/>\nquality we foster in ourselves and we aim to foster in our children<br/>\n- we do however also try to avoid accumulating lots of &quot;things&quot; and  <br/>\nspending &quot;excessive&quot; amounts on ourselves<br/>\n- also realize how complicated our modeling on this issue is since  <br/>\nour decision about whether to buy something we like is based on &quot;how  <br/>\nmuch do we need it & is it worth the money&quot; which are both extremely  <br/>\nsubjective criteria which also often rely on a fair bit of info<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed our dd self regulate in other areas where there is  <br/>\nmore feedback for her to work with  � so she gets sick of dvds, she  <br/>\nfeels the impact of food on her body. However it seems that buying  <br/>\nmore things has no real impact because we tend to avoid arbitrary  <br/>\nlimits on money and she does not quite get the idea of budgets  <br/>\n(although we are trying to explain it, its partly because we dont  <br/>\nwork to a strict budget but just internally limit our spending  <br/>\nmaybe?) and new things just get spread throughout the house.<br/>\n<br/>\none thing we have started to try is avoiding impulse buying... so  <br/>\nwhen we go to the shops we discuss what we want. Then if something  <br/>\nelse comes up we try to &quot;come back&quot; if we are still interested in the  <br/>\nnext few days. We discussed this with her and apply it to ourselves  <br/>\nas well... but it still seems like an external crutch to her self  <br/>\nregulating her decisions on this... and i know the fun & enjoyment of  <br/>\noccasional spontaneous buying too<br/>\n<br/>\nDd has her own purse with money in it... we give her money when she  <br/>\nasks for it and so far she has had very little need to spend it  <br/>\n(although she has given us money when we have been caught short a few  <br/>\ntimes). My gut feeling is against pocket money at this early stage of  <br/>\nshifting to RU, which i feel creates an artificial separation of  <br/>\nmoney � we dont ration out money between me & my dw for example...  <br/>\nits &quot;our&quot; money. Although when dd feels confident that she can have  <br/>\nmoney if she needs it maybe we will chat to her about giving her a  <br/>\nregular amount as well rather than her having to ask... But im keen  <br/>\nto hear your spin on this...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments are welcome but im basically wondering how do we  <br/>\nencourage a less consumerist approach without artificially limiting  <br/>\nmoney? Do i just be more patient and is this just a final RU  <br/>\ntransition thing or am i missing something here?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance,<br/>\narun<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n| anne + arun |<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theparentingpit.com\">http://www.theparentingpit.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28185,"nextTopicId":28155}}
