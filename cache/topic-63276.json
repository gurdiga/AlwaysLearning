I made a similar trip with four young people a couple of weeks ago, but that was more rushed.  Keith and I are goofing around.  As I write this, Saturday about dinner time, Keith&#39;s accidentally fallen asleep and I have no internet, so this will probably launch itself unexpectedly in the middle of the night or something, when the spotty wifi coughs up some power.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way up here, we were talking about Holly, and Keith remarked on her confidence--that part of what made her attractive was that she has a confident presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s true.  She doesn&#39;t avoid eye contact, she has not a bit of ducking or shame or avoidance or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to share a description of herself on some website:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Singing, dancing, stretching, growing, farting, thinking, expanding, shining and dining. Seemingly random notes in between can be found here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI like her confidence and lack of self-consciousness, even in something that casual.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63245,"nextTopicId":63265}}
