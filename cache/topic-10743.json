Saturday&#39;s take <br/>\nbalanced, but nothing did when I added up all the sales.  <br/>\n<br/>\n::whew:::  Now I just have to deal with the girl&#39;s propensity to ask people <br/>\nfor money for herself.  I realize this is a cultural issue--she&#39;s a different <br/>\nrace than me.  It happens to me on occasion, little kids--strangers to <br/>\nme--approaching me and asking for quarters or dollars.  Even had a boy about <br/>\n9 come up and ask me if he could have a piece of our pizza!  I find it rude <br/>\nand obnoxious, and realize that others might feel differently.  But what is <br/>\nthat about?  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10656,"nextTopicId":10747}}
