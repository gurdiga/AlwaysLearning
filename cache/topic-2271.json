I<br/>\ncan tell you some of the things Tamzin has picked out<br/>\nthat have gone down a treat.<br/>\nWatercolor paints and paper, butterfly garden (we<br/>\nhaven&#39;t used this yet - will do in the spring),<br/>\nvarious educational games and puzzles, CD Roms,<br/>\nAudubon guides, recorder and music books, Pattern<br/>\nBlocks, weaving loom (made loads of Christmas pressies<br/>\nwith this one!), beginning sewing book, glitter paint,<br/>\nand a knitting spool. I know there are other things as<br/>\nwell, but those are the ones off the top of my head.<br/>\nWe get most of our supplies from the Rainbow Resource<br/>\nCenter (great prices!) and Dick Blick Art Materials<br/>\n(funny name and great prices!).<br/>\nAs far as language programs, The Learnables is<br/>\nsupposed to be great. Total immersion program that<br/>\nfocuses on just listening at the start. I have some<br/>\nfriends that use it and love it. We&#39;re planning to get<br/>\nit (hopefully from the charter school library!).<br/>\nTamzin loves Madeline and France and &quot;wants to learn<br/>\nFrench better&quot;. The other advice I&#39;ve gotten about<br/>\nlearning a new language is to just listen to<br/>\neverything you can find in the language that you want<br/>\nto learn for the first year (at least). Particularly<br/>\nchildren&#39;s songs and stories (they have the simplest,<br/>\nmost regular speech patterns apparently). <br/>\nHappy Shopping!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!

It&#39;s been pretty<br/>\ngood, the EA we have leaves us alone, I email<br/>\nher my monthly summary of what Lexie has done<br/>\nand Mark drops off the attendance form or she<br/>\ncomes and gets it.  We&#39;ve seen her 3 x since<br/>\nSeptember.  So I&#39;m Ok with that.  But we have<br/>\nlike $500 to spend (now that Lexie wont&#39; go<br/>\nto that school) and I am wondering how to<br/>\nspend it.  In Septemeber Lexie picked out<br/>\nsome work books--two critical thinking books,<br/>\nthe HP reading guide (I only let her get one,<br/>\nI wanted to see them before spending $ on<br/>\nthem), a few math books (Time and Money, and<br/>\na cuisenaire rod one), and a few other work<br/>\nbook type things.  She made most of the<br/>\nchoices. Janene also choose a few things in<br/>\nSept (Linking elephants and a book for<br/>\nthem.)   I&#39;d like to stay away from work<br/>\nbooks now, though.  We have plenty of books<br/>\nfor her to read, chapter books, and such,<br/>\nalthough I want to buy the rest of the<br/>\nAmerican Girl series.  We;ve read Meet Addy<br/>\nand one other and she likes them, although<br/>\nthey are too easy for her to read, the<br/>\ncontent is right on, and she loves history.<br/>\nLexie agrees that is good choice.  We are<br/>\nalso looking for a Spanish program as she<br/>\nwants to continue the spanish.  I was<br/>\nthinking art supplies, but what else to spend<br/>\nthat money on? any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2337,"nextTopicId":2295}}
