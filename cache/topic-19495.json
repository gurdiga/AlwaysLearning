Programmers write Java programs--called<br/>\n&quot;applets&quot;--that automatically download from the web and run on your<br/>\ncomputer.  In fact, if the Java applets are written well, they&#39;ll run<br/>\non almost EVERY computer: PCs, Macs, *nix boxes, cell phones,<br/>\nrefrigerators... chances are, your computer came with the ability to<br/>\nload and run Java applets straight out of the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do these Java applets look like?  Well, for example, there&#39;s a<br/>\nfree Java applet on the web called &quot;AirportMonitor&quot; that lets you<br/>\ntrack all inbound and outbound flights at LAX (and a few other<br/>\nairports).  You can find the LAX AirportMonitor Java applet at<br/>\n<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www4.passur.com/lax.html\">http://www4.passur.com/lax.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLike most Java applets, just visit the site and the applet <br/>\nautomatically loads in your web browser.  And be patient: The <br/>\nAirportMonitor applet might take just short of forever to load.  <br/>\nYour patience will be rewarded, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find a list of other AiportMonitor-enabled sites at<br/>\n<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.passur.com/sites.htm\">http://www.passur.com/sites.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if you want to find out where my beloved hometown of Irvine,<br/>\nCalifornia, is actually located, hop on over to<br/>\n<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www4.passur.com/sna.html\">http://www4.passur.com/sna.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand play around with the map range.  Irvine is in the middle of the <br/>\nmap, just to the right of the John Wayne airport (SNA).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, remember how I said that Java applets automatically download <br/>\nfrom the web and run on your computer?  Think about that for a <br/>\nminute. Considering the number of viruses and Trojan horses out <br/>\nthere, do we *REALLY* want downloaded Java programs auto-executing <br/>\non our computers?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nJava applets run in something called a &quot;sandbox&quot; (actually it&#39;s <br/>\ncalled the &quot;Java RunTime Environment&quot;).  The sandbox is just a <br/>\nspecial zone on your computer fenced off from your operating system <br/>\nand other applications.  In theory, Java applets can&#39;t get outside <br/>\nof the sandbox and damage your computer.  In theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that there are two major &quot;flavors&quot; of Java:<br/>\n<br/>\n     1. Microsoft&#39;s (which you already have if you own a PC) and<br/>\n     2. Sun&#39;s (which you don&#39;t have).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Microsoft&#39;s version of Java, the sandbox is better known <br/>\nas &quot;Windows.&quot;  Okay, that&#39;s an exaggeration.  But, it is not an <br/>\nexaggeration to say that in Microsoft&#39;s version of Java there are <br/>\nsome pretty significant security holes in the wall between the <br/>\nsandbox and the OS.  And that&#39;s a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven worse, Microsoft&#39;s Java Virtual Machine (the software on PCs <br/>\nthat actually runs Java applets) is<br/>\n<br/>\n     - Buggy,<br/>\n     - Proprietary, and<br/>\n     - Not long for this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy way of comparison, Sun&#39;s version of Java is<br/>\n<br/>\n     - Newer,<br/>\n     - Safer (because it has a MUCH better sandbox), and<br/>\n     - Official (because, after all, Sun invented Java.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and what did I mean when I said that Microsoft&#39;s Java Virtual <br/>\nMachine is not long for this world?  Well, Microsoft will stop <br/>\nsupporting their JVM version on September 30th, 2004.  And, because <br/>\nof Microsoft&#39;s recent court settlement with Sun, there will be no <br/>\nreplacement.  Microsoft recommends that, after 9/30, you lock down <br/>\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer security zones so that the MSJVM works <br/>\nonly with trusted sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nMicrosoft has even created a page that talks about transitioning <br/>\nfrom the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine [you can find the page at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/%5d\">http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/%5d</a> but a MUCH better solution <br/>\nfor folks like you and me is to hop on over to<br/>\n<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp\">http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand get Sun&#39;s official Java software.  The process couldn&#39;t be <br/>\nsimpler: Just click on the &quot;Get It Now&quot; button and Sun automatically <br/>\ndownloads and installs the official Java software your computer.  <br/>\nAnd Sun&#39;s free Java software is available for the PC, Mac, Linux, and<br/>\n(obviously) Sun Solaris.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll [probably] be asked to reboot once the new Java software is <br/>\ninstalled.  Once you reboot, though, you&#39;ll have the latest, <br/>\ngreatest version of Java.  And, if you are a PC user, you won&#39;t have <br/>\nto worry about what&#39;s going to happen when Microsoft&#39;s JVM  <br/>\nfficially dies in September.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeat, huh?  And once you&#39;ve updated your Java, you can find a BUNCH <br/>\nof free Java applets to play with at<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jars.com/listing/jars_top5_games_001.html\">http://www.jars.com/listing/jars_top5_games_001.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n* * * * *<br/>\n<br/>\nTOURBUS Volume 9, Number 31 -- 21 Jan 2004<br/>\n<br/>\nMore Java<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my last post [which was actually a couple of weeks ago] I told <br/>\nyou how to download and install Sun&#39;s official version of Java but <br/>\nforgot to tell you what you should do with your Microsoft Java <br/>\nVirtual Machine AFTER the installation.  Whoops!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may sound kind of strange, but my gut feeling is that you <br/>\nshould *NOT* uninstall the MSJVM.  Rather, you should abandon it in <br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s why.  Uninstalling Windows components, even ones that are <br/>\ngoing to die in September, is a fool&#39;s errand if only because you <br/>\nhave no idea if the uninstall is going work.  The worst case <br/>\nscenario is that you could unintentionally break Windows in the <br/>\nprocess.  And that&#39;s a risk I&#39;m just not willing to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, to make sure your Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is sent <br/>\noff to its own private Siberia, download and install the Sun version <br/>\nof Java and then<br/>\n<br/>\n     1. In Internet Explorer, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options.<br/>\n     2. Click on the Advanced tab.<br/>\n     3. Scroll down to the Java settings and make sure there is a<br/>\n        checkmark next to Use Java 2 v1.42_03 for &lt;applet&gt;<br/>\n     4. Scroll down Microsoft VM and uncheck everything.<br/>\n     5. Click on OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that,<br/>\n<br/>\n     1. Open your PC&#39;s control panel.  (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control<br/>\n        Panel; Start &gt; Control Panel in XP)<br/>\n            1a. If you have XP and your Control Panel is a purple<br/>\n                page asking you to Pick a Category, click on Switch<br/>\n                to Classic View in the upper left corner of the page.<br/>\n     2. Double-click on the Java Control Panel icon. (If you have two<br/>\n        Java Control Panel icons, click on purple and red one not the<br/>\n        black, white, and red one that looks like a ouija board<br/>\n        pointer).<br/>\n     3. It&#39;ll take a while for the control panel to open, but when it<br/>\n        does click on the browser tab.<br/>\n     4. Make sure there is a checkmark next to all of the browsers<br/>\n        that you use.<br/>\n     5. Click on apply and then close the control panel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, restart your computer.  That&#39;s it.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick Douglas Crispen<br/>\nThe Tourbus<br/>\n<br/>\n* * * * *<br/>\n<br/>\n(Now another word from Wendy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard recently from someone else who also recently got an XP <br/>\ncomputer or upgraded to XP and could not use Java (and therefore <br/>\ncould not use much of Math Cats).  Maybe since Microsoft is ending <br/>\nits support for Java soon, they are not including it in the latest <br/>\nversion of XP.  It is really ridiculous.  Much of the Web depends on <br/>\nJava.  So I hope you&#39;ll all help spread the word that it makes sense <br/>\nto turn to Sun for reliable Java.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wendy<br/>\n<br/>\n* * * * *<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, tuckervill2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I got a new computer with XP recently, and I keep getting pop-ups <br/>\non some <br/>\n&gt; sites that run Java.
