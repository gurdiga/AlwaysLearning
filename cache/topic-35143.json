She turned 13 last March.  She will be attending the local community college, as a concurrently enrolled student, enrolled in our private school as a high school student (we keep changing her grade per whatever requirement needs to be met, officially, if she had gone to school, she&#39;d be finishing her 7th grade year now, but I think I just put 9th grade on her work permit.)  Because she hasn&#39;t finished her 10th grade year, she had to go through an interview process to be admitted to the school.  It was, to put it simply, frighteningly casual, this interview.  The dean of admissions came out to the waiting room, sat next to Alexx on the bench, and said &quot;what makes you think you are capable of handling college?&quot;  Alexx responded, I can&#39;t remember what she said, but she used her usual multisyllabic vocabulary...  and the woman told her that she was more mature than many of the 18 year olds that attend the college.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point Alexx has a lot of choices.  She can just hang out, taking a class or two a semester, for a few years, and then take the SATs, and try to get a scholarship, with her grades at college and her SATs, she&#39;s a good test taker.  Or she could take a few more classes and get her AA in a few years, and then transfer to a 4 year college, perhaps with a scholarship... Starting this at 13, she has lots of choices, and all of them are good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, it&#39;s pretty funny to be helping her prepare for her first day.  And interesting in that she&#39;s 13.  New messenger bag, new notebook and pencils and pens, a new phone, her ID....They are really into truancies these days so that ID is really important, she can pull that out and not have an issue... and a bus pass.  She&#39;ll be taking the bus as I work...  I am taking a few hours off on Monday to driver her there the first day...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and did I mention that her classes are free?  We pay a fee for her to use the health facilities, $13 a month, and another $11 for her id, I think, that will be all we pay per semester, regardless of how many classes she takes. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe did call her professor for her first class, and he balked when he heard she was 13.  On the phone anyway.  She went in later that day to get a script (It&#39;s a theater arts class) and 30 minutes later she came out and said &quot;he is totally comfortable with me in the class&quot; and handed me paperwork that mapped out what classes she would need to take to get a degree in theater arts.  I do have to say that Alexx does not look or act 13.  Which is damn scary and also amazing.  We&#39;ve talked about what she will need to do if men hit on her... <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Early admission to college","postDate":"1212286302","msgId":35155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3RDNFNEVCMTI2MTRDRDc5QkFGQjI3QTJFNDI2MkQyQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDczMzYxNC40OTc4Ny5xbUB3ZWI1NTMxMC5tYWlsLnJlNC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDczMzYxNC40OTc4Ny5xbUB3ZWI1NTMxMC5tYWlsLnJlNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35154,"nextInTopic":35157,"prevInTime":35154,"nextInTime":35156,"topicId":35143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I went to college and high school at the same time and that was in the late 70 s ;)  I went to college in the morning and high school in the afternoon my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1096474895\">I went to college and high school at the same time and that was in the late 70&#39;s ;)  I went to college in the morning and high school in the afternoon my senior year.  Many of the homeschoolers and unschoolers in our local (eclectic) group take college classes without a GED - I think there is a placement test (maybe) and many of them start when they are 13 or 14.  They usually start with one or two classes at a time and often times it is something they are very interested in.  I do know that some colleges are more friendly to this approach than others - so to get around this some people take course work at the accommodating colleges and then transfer later when they have credits available - if there is a specific college they really want to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.__ <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159184374,"authorName":"Beverly Keeling Elwazani","from":"Beverly Keeling Elwazani &lt;elwazani@...&gt;","profile":"elwazani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Early admission to college","postDate":"1212277922","msgId":35154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczMzYxNC40OTc4Ny5xbUB3ZWI1NTMxMC5tYWlsLnJlNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35151,"nextInTopic":35155,"prevInTime":35153,"nextInTime":35155,"topicId":35143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might find out if the state he lives in has an option for college as a high schooler.&nbsp; In Ohio they have PESOP which allows students to attend college","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-275134187\">You might find out if the state he lives in has an option for college as a high schooler.&nbsp; In Ohio they have PESOP which allows students to attend college and earn both high school and college credits, it is paid for by the state and includes their fees and books...my daughter is going part time to the high school and unschooling the rest of the time ( I know that sounds odd but I will elaborate)&nbsp; next year she will take Italian as a sophmore in high school but will get college credit for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Early admission to college","postDate":"1212265999","msgId":35151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxc2NtZitkajYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcxcmJidStqa200QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35148,"nextInTopic":35154,"prevInTime":35150,"nextInTime":35152,"topicId":35143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... with ...
