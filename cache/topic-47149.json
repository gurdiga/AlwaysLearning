This post has really encouraged me. My two older boys (12 & 15) have been deeply immersed in the &quot;Friends&quot; sitcom for some time.  They&#39;ve watched and rewatched episode after episode after episode.  Sometimes I&#39;ve been fine with this, and sometimes I&#39;ve struggled.  I&#39;ve found it difficult to &quot;delight&quot; in it, though.  I&#39;ve found it hard to see much value in it, to be honest.  Your post has encouraged me to delight in THIS moment, but also to have faith and hope that something else may come out of it later.  I guess, really, even if its just pure enjoyment, that ain&#39;t a bad thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I have noticed is that my 12yo seems to be very aware of various actors (and occasionally producers). He notices if an actor from one show or movie is in another one, and has enjoyed looking their info up on sites like IMDB to see what else they&#39;ve been in.  This has then led to him watching some of their other movies.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Friends&quot; is the definite main focus in terms of TV though.

I have learned so much from this book. The chapter titled &quot;Schooling: The Hidden Agenda&quot; by Daniel Quinn gave me such an awaking experience. It really made me think, look back on my son&#39;s learning as a small child, how we&#39;ve done things the past few years, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit 6 months ago I didn&#39;t know a thing about unschooling (I still am learning but know much more). I also must admit I assumed a lot...mostly things that fell under a negative light. Unschooling was nothing I thought it was. I was wrong to assume. Knowledge is power. I am now becoming knowledgeable. I realized that my son actually unschooled all his earlier life, up until 5 years and 1 week old, when he got on that bus for his first day of public school kindergarten (I lived in an area where homeschooling was not talked about and didn&#39;t even know there was such a thing - I wish I had). Actually he still carried on with an unschooling lifestyle outside of school. He carried on an unschooling lifestyle outside of our lessons we did when I started homeschooling him. Our lessons got less in the way then public school education did, but I have learned that he learns and grows much more through the unschooling lifestyle. <br/>\n <br/>\nI was public schooled myself, so homeschooling in a way that was not school-at-home was something to get used to. Unschooling I feel will be even harder for me to get used to. I will just need to take a couple breaths in those hard moments and remind myself of all the things he taught himself (to sit-up, crawl, walk, read, use the potty, talk, etc, etc). For example right now he has a stack of books about South America he is reading. He also asked if I would buy him the evan-mor workbook on South America, and is doing lots of research on-line (he would like to learn more about each continent). I know what my boy was like before public school. I felt that pure enjoyment to soak up everything and anything was just not able to happen. It was much improved once homeschooling. I can see that in fact that joy can actually remain throughout life. He knows what he wants, along with God&#39;s help.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n~ Jean, homeschooling mom to an 11-year-old boy and daycare provider to 6<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47086,"nextTopicId":47181}}
