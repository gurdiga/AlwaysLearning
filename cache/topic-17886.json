He will take care of getting permits.   That will be $600<br/>\nnow....just for permits?<br/>\n<br/>\n10:00 I am helping Zach shave goats in the rain because we are headed to a<br/>\nshow this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n10:30  The water tank guy says I need a new pump, new pipe and a new tank.<br/>\nIt will be $2500 to install it....they don&#39;t finance or take credit.<br/>\n<br/>\n11:00  I finally scrounge up the money<br/>\n<br/>\n11:30  The septic guys complete pumping the tank...That will be $350 in<br/>\ncash.....now please.<br/>\n<br/>\n11:35  As I find the money, I hear the septic tank guy ask the kids if they<br/>\njust watch tv all day to which the kids answer in the affirmative &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\nHe then asks them if they can read....at least they answered yes to that<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:00  I help Adriane shave goats in the rain  (wet goat hair is extremely<br/>\nticklish)<br/>\n<br/>\n12:30 The kids holler that the bathroom is flooded.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:31 I watch the dog take off down the road and realize the septic tank<br/>\nguys left the gate open<br/>\n<br/>\n12:32 The water tank guy comes by for his money but it is gone.  I have lost<br/>\n$2500!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n12:33 The kids are still hollering about the flooded bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:34 I am running around looking for the money while the water tank guy<br/>\nwaits not so patiently on the porch.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:35 I discover that Zach put the money in his wallet for safe keeping.<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n12:36 I open the door to give the money to the water tank guy and the muddy<br/>\ndog runs into the house and across the beige carpet.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:37 The bathroom is still flooded several inches deep.  Dan says he was<br/>\nhaving trouble with the toilet paper so he needed to use a lot. &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n3:00  The bathroom is semi-dry and the wet towels are starting to wash.  The<br/>\nliving room rug is no longer muddy.<br/>\n<br/>\n3:30 Zach informs me that both shirts he needs to wear to show goats in are<br/>\ntoo short in the sleeves. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n4:00 I start running kids back and forth to gymnastics<br/>\n<br/>\n5:00 I start dinner<br/>\n<br/>\n6:00 We eat and Jerry offers to take Zach into San Antonio to get a couple<br/>\nof shirts.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:00  I pick up the last kid from gymnastics.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:00 The little guys are in bed and Jerry goes on a call with the volunteer<br/>\nfire dept..<br/>\n<br/>\n11:00  It starts raining again and we decide we better move the stock<br/>\ntrailer before it gets too muddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMidnight    Jerry, Zach and I are trying to get the trailer unstuck.  It is<br/>\nburied deep.  I am wearing my pajamas, black rubber boots and am covered in<br/>\nmud.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:30  I go in the garage and find several bags of hand-me-downs dropped off<br/>\nby a friend while I was out running around during the day.  It was just used<br/>\nclothes but it made such a difference in the day.  I didn&#39;t know she was<br/>\ngoing to do it and it made me feel good that somebody thought of doing a<br/>\nsmall favor for us.  We could really use it that day.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:00am  my period starts  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17875,"nextTopicId":17884}}
