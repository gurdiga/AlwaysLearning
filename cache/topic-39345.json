We&#39;ve had a haunted barn in the past and he&#39;s<br/>\nstarted decorating the front yard for Halloween this year.  He would<br/>\nlove to see your son&#39;s Slaughterhouse!!  A friend has plan for him to<br/>\nhelp her with her Halloween party this year.  She has created some<br/>\npretty spectacular haunted barns and carriage rides in the past.  I am<br/>\nalso planning to get to several of the local haunted houses this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also likes to make scary movies.  He has always loved scary movies<br/>\nand scary stories.  He started with Scooby Doo and Goosebumps and<br/>\nprogressed by way of Hitchcock films to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on<br/>\nElm Street, etc.  He has made several of his own films - two are on<br/>\nyoutube: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As0G1ihWv70\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As0G1ihWv70</a> and<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn0LoL37RDQ&feature=related\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn0LoL37RDQ&feature=related</a>  We have<br/>\ntalked about suspense versus in your face gore and how it plays out in<br/>\nour favorites.

It<br/>\nabsolutely doesn&#39;t mean that all the other kids shouldn&#39;t say anything<br/>\nabout it or that they should have to routinely put up with it, just<br/>\nbecause the other child can&#39;t help themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wrote earlier that the possiblity she&#39;s progressed to nicknames as a<br/>\n&gt; sign of affection.

This can cause another whole set of problems.   <br/>\nYES, sometimes families hit it off.  Sometimes playgroups last for  <br/>\n*years* (ours here lasted six or seven good years, others have lasted  <br/>\nlonger, some don&#39;t last a year).  Sometimes a conference experience  <br/>\ncan be emotionally and spiritually transporting, but you can&#39;t live  <br/>\nat a conference.  It&#39;s meant to give you good ideas you can take into  <br/>\nyour own daily life.  That&#39;s one reason I worry about the &quot;non com&quot;  <br/>\ndeals that don&#39;t have speakers.  Being where other people are being  <br/>\nloose and free and sweet is great, but it can&#39;t happen in groups 24  <br/>\nhours a day.  Somewhere in there people need to learn what&#39;s creating  <br/>\nthose relationships so they can have them at home, themselves, far  <br/>\nfrom other unschoolers, on a Tuesday of a bad week, and not just wait  <br/>\nfor another chance to bask in the somewhat mysterious happiness of a  <br/>\nbig group of unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m preachin&#39; to the choir, because people here are on a serious  <br/>\nunschooling discussion list, I know.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were complaints after the Live and Learn conference in St.  <br/>\nLouis a few years ago, that it had been just like school because some  <br/>\nof the girls already knew each other and so there were &quot;cliques.&quot;  It  <br/>\nseemed to me the most just-like-school aspect of that was the idea  <br/>\nthat my daughter (any or every daughter) had to socialize with  <br/>\neveryone equally, just because they were there, just because they  <br/>\nwere unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool has the outward appearance of kids having lots of friends.  On  <br/>\nthe inside they&#39;re saying &quot;You&#39;re not here to socialize,&quot; and if  <br/>\nsomeone has six or ten friends she&#39;s really lucky.  Some have two,  <br/>\none or none.  Some have way more enemies and abusers than friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to the topic here.   The idea that other unschoolers are  <br/>\nobligated to be kind and generous to and therapeutic for other  <br/>\nunschooling kids seems to go against the more central principles of  <br/>\nchoices and the right to just say no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could tell lots of stories of my kids being generous and kind and  <br/>\ntherapeutic, but every single time, they did it because they wanted  <br/>\nto.  And there were times they didn&#39;t want to, and so they didn&#39;t.   <br/>\nIf I try to pressure my kids to become practice pads for kids who  <br/>\nneed social-skills-drumming, how is that right and good?<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly reminded me the other day of an incident at a conference in  <br/>\nAlbuquerque in which some younger girls had asked her to come to  <br/>\ntheir room and play.  She was with older girls and said &quot;Right now  <br/>\nI&#39;m doing [whatever], but I&#39;ll come up there later,&quot; and she got the  <br/>\nroom number.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t hear any of this until later, and I was glad she brought it  <br/>\nup again this week, because it made me proud of her, and it also gave  <br/>\nme a story to tell here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom didn&#39;t really think Holly would show up, but the little girls  <br/>\nwere sure, and they wanted to go to the room and wait.   It might  <br/>\nhave been an easy thing for a teenager to say &quot;yeah, sure, later&quot; and  <br/>\nthen forget all about it, or be persuaded to come do other things  <br/>\nwith the teens.  But Holly said she would, and she did.  She went  <br/>\nthere and played and had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I known and &quot;made her&quot; go there, she wouldn&#39;t have had fun.  She  <br/>\nmight not have gone.  We might have had an argument about it.  She  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have been as likely to share stories with me after that.   <br/>\nBut without ANY parental involvement, of her own volition, she made  <br/>\nthat offer and carried it through in a direct and real way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the result of years of me keeping my word to her (not  <br/>\ncounting mending; there are some things in the mending pile I haven&#39;t  <br/>\ngotten to, and I feel guilty), and talking through situations with  <br/>\nher in which her feelings were hurt or she had hurt other people&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings, for years and years before that day.  She wants to feel  <br/>\ngood.  She likes to feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been other incidents at conferences where other kids or  <br/>\nparents weren&#39;t as nice or as appreciative, but Holly&#39;s pretty good  <br/>\nat seeing what part of the problem is hers and what is theirs, and  <br/>\nnot in a mean, challenging &quot;HA!

The mother and Susis will <br/>\nthen have to work on a friendly tactic and a more nurturing approach, <br/>\nto the friendship.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that Susis&#39; mom will not &quot;lay into her&quot; because I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow her. Maybe the poster have a more first hand observation of <br/>\nSusie&#39;s mum, whether she&#39;s the type that will give Susie a severe <br/>\ndressing down, or maybe the mother is the type who&#39;s kind and <br/>\nprotective of her daughter. I have yet to meet any mum with <br/>\na &quot;diagnosed asperger condition&quot; child who will get offended if <br/>\napproach about thier child&#39;s un-welcome behaviour. If anything, we <br/>\naspie mum&#39;s do understand and will strive to help make it an easier <br/>\nworld for our children and everyone concern. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying or defending that the label entitle us or our children <br/>\nto behaving differently, but the &quot;differentness&quot; in an asperger <br/>\nchild&#39;s mind is very real, and what they perceived to be normal and <br/>\nfunny, is distinctly different to ours. They are also very narrow <br/>\nfocus minded to a point of obliviousness, so it will help the child <br/>\nwhen the parents points out many different emotions and actions <br/>\npossible, outside thier very limited one track minds. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe the poster need to establish if the child is really with the <br/>\nasperger condition or not before taking it further? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I do understand what Sandra wrote about people is not obligated <br/>\nto do anything for other people. But then if you saw someone in a <br/>\nwheel chair trying to get up the hill, wouldn&#39;t you offer a helping <br/>\nhand along the way?  Having asperger is just as disabling, but <br/>\nunfortunately it&#39;s not as visible as a wheel chair or walking stick. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357843301,"authorName":"lyeping2008","from":"&quot;lyeping2008&quot; &lt;lyeping2008@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2008","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help figuring out kids&#39; friendships","postDate":"1223810759","msgId":39369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjc21zNytub2UyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjczFtNys5ZDR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39367,"nextInTopic":39371,"prevInTime":39368,"nextInTime":39370,"topicId":39345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wrote: And would you automatically assume that your child is at fault because that is the interpretation that someone has told you because your child has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1737823969\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\nAnd would you automatically assume that your child is at fault because <br/>\nthat is the interpretation that someone has told you because your <br/>\nchild has aspergers?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nA little bit off topic, bt I would like to response to Joanna. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo. Just because my kid&#39;s got asperger, it does not automatically mean <br/>\nit&#39;s his fault. On contrary, I have work very hard at un-tangling <br/>\nthe &quot;it&#39;s always my fault&quot; mentality that we have to deal with 21 <br/>\nmonths ago. Like I said, when we&#39;re dealing with asperger, it is quite <br/>\ncommonly we&#39;re dealing with low self esteem issues, especially if the <br/>\nchild been taken out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always believe there&#39;s 2 side to a story. Which is why I always seek <br/>\nto listen to both side. So if a parent comes to me, I&#39;ve heard herside <br/>\nfirst. Then I&#39;ll go hear my son&#39;s version. This provide me a good <br/>\npicture of what happened. For me, a valuable opportunity for me to <br/>\nunderstand my son&#39;s individual way of thinking, and also a chance to <br/>\nhelp him understand and manage this complex world of social do&#39;s and <br/>\ndon&#39;t. Or if he comes to me first, then I&#39;ll approach the other <br/>\nparent, seeking her child&#39;s side fo the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, it&#39;s always a little mis-understanding that, with a little <br/>\ninsight and explanation, very easily explained.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, an apology is always in the air - either we&#39;re expecting <br/>\nit (and rarely getting it LOL!), or we&#39;re the ones offering it. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, saying sorry is not necessary about admitting we&#39;re wrong or <br/>\nacknowledging faults. Saying sorry is about acknowledging that someone <br/>\nfeelings has been hurt. Such a simple word, but yet so effective in <br/>\ndispersing any tension and heartache there is. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Sandra is right. I cannot expect other people to be tell me <br/>\nanything. I cannot expect people to think like me. Sorry might be such <br/>\na simple and healing word to me, but to some other&#39;s it might mean <br/>\nalot more. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in my case, as and when my kid is innocent and the other parent do <br/>\nnot acknowledge it and not offer the healing word of sorry, I always <br/>\ntell my son &quot;I&#39;m sorry the other mummy didn&#39;t believe you, but it&#39;s ok <br/>\nbecause I do&quot;. He&#39;s learnt that by saying sorry, he&#39;s capable of <br/>\nhealing another person&#39;s heart. But if he doesn&#39;t receive it, it&#39;s ok <br/>\ntoo. It&#39;s NOT because he&#39;s at fault but only because the other party <br/>\nis uncomfortable giving it. And he&#39;s happy, and life moves on.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot expect poeple to reciprocate the way I do, and I don&#39;t.

My experience has been that most people don&#39;t really want to be told when their <br/>\nchildren aren&#39;t charming, but they will say they do, because the always want to be <br/>\n&quot;honest.&quot;  (There is a sarcastic tone that may not have come across in my e-mail--LOL)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the way something is &quot;told&quot; can make all the difference, as well as how many times <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been told lately, how they are feeling in the moment, whether they feel safe in a <br/>\nsocial situation, etc.  It&#39;s not necessarily a simple thing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have recently told a mother how her child&#39;s behaviour is hurting my <br/>\n&gt; son&#39;s feelings, despite my son talking to her son many times about it. <br/>\n&gt; It blew up in my face big time LOL!!

But it still seems clear to me that the <br/>\noriginal poster wasn&#39;t there and it&#39;s still second-hand information to her.

They both came back to the house and talked a  <br/>\nwhile and Marty said &quot;I need to sleep, I&#39;m going to bed&quot; and he did.   <br/>\nThe other friend should have left, but he started hanging out with  <br/>\nHolly and her boyfriend.  After a while Holly wanted him to go home.   <br/>\nHe hadn&#39;t been invited, Marty had heavily hinted for him to leave,  <br/>\nand he was being purposely dense because he just didn&#39;t want to go  <br/>\nhome to his own apartment and his own cat.

I was willing to tell the friend myself that Holly has no  <br/>\nobligation to be nice to him if he comes over uninvited by her and  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take any &quot;go home&quot; hints.

One  <br/>\nof which, he&#39;s exchanged e-mails with. Susie and my son Sam have  <br/>\nthings in common personality-wise and interest-wise and have decided  <br/>\nthrough their e-mail conversations, that they&#39;d like to get together  <br/>\nand work on an art project together. They see each other once a week  <br/>\nat a local homeschool activity (physical) that&#39;s structured, but they  <br/>\ndo have bits of time to talk during it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the activity this week, in the course of conversation about  <br/>\nwhen and where we could meet to work on the art project, Sam said  <br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t sure he liked Susie any more and sounded quite  <br/>\ndisappointed. When I asked him about it, he said that Susie was  <br/>\ncalling another one of his friends, Joey, participating in the group  <br/>\nactivity, &quot;Miss Joey&quot; in a teasing way, and that Joey was *very*  <br/>\nupset by it. I suggested that if I were someone like Susie, who  <br/>\nwanted to be his friend, I would rather someone say that they didn&#39;t  <br/>\nlike something I was doing, rather than just stop talking to me and  <br/>\nhanging out with me. We talked about what he could say and how he  <br/>\ncould say it and the different options about where he could talk to  <br/>\nher (in private or in front of the group) and he took that all in and  <br/>\nseemed to be mulling over his options.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat evening, I was at a gathering of homeschool parents and was  <br/>\ntalking about Sam and Susie&#39;s growing friendship and recounting how I  <br/>\nhad talked to Sam about things - more in the vein of &quot;this is a cool  <br/>\nthing I could talk over with my kid rather than taking the situation  <br/>\nout of his hands and handling it myself&quot; than anything else. The mom  <br/>\nI was talking to has a child, Pat, in the class, too, who is friends  <br/>\nwith Joey, and said that Susie had done the same thing at the  <br/>\nactivity last week and that Pat and Joe had come to their moms  <br/>\n(relaxed homeschoolers) saying what had happened and the moms had  <br/>\nkind of said it was likely Susie goofing off and trying to be funny.  <br/>\nShe also said that the two of them hadn&#39;t said anything about it  <br/>\nafter the activity today, so that they might not have heard it or it  <br/>\nwas not a big deal any more. That was *not* Sam&#39;s take on things:  <br/>\nJoey seemed quite upset to Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a mom, Mary (NOT Susie&#39;s mom, but the mother of an  <br/>\nAsperger&#39;s labeled child), nearby who overheard what was going on and  <br/>\nspoke up, saying, &quot;You know, Susie has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. That&#39;s  <br/>\njust how she is, she&#39;s trying to joke around with the kids and thinks  <br/>\nshe&#39;s being funny. If one of the kids says something to her, it&#39;s  <br/>\njust going to get worse. If you tell her mom, she&#39;ll HANDLE it.&quot;  I  <br/>\ntook from the way she said &quot;handle it&quot; that Susie was either going to  <br/>\nget a severe dressing down or physically punished. Mary is a gossip  <br/>\nand kind of twists things in the retelling to make conflict, so I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot too happy she overheard this and took it out of context, but the  <br/>\nreal problem is how do I handle it, now?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be the cause of Susie getting laid into, nor start  <br/>\nout a relationship with this new mom I don&#39;t know yet with stories of  <br/>\nher daughter&#39;s &quot;misbehavior&quot;. On one hand, if that story hadn&#39;t come  <br/>\nup at that moment where it was overheard, we&#39;d never have known about<br/>\n<br/>\nSusie&#39;s label and this supposed conflict with what I&#39;d talked over  <br/>\nwith my son. If we&#39;d just have met her in the park while her mom was  <br/>\noff somewhere, I wouldn&#39;t have stopped to say, &quot;Okay, is this a non- <br/>\nlabeled kid who we can say something to or could this child possibly  <br/>\nhave a developmental disorder who can&#39;t hear something simple like,  <br/>\n&#39;Hey, that&#39;s not cool.&#39;?&quot; On the other hand, if it is true that it  <br/>\nwill escalate her behavior (though I don&#39;t see how talking to her  <br/>\nafter the activity in private could transfer to it being worse a week  <br/>\nlater, with the description Mary gave - it seemed more of a &quot;in the  <br/>\nmoment&quot;/nervousness kind of thing), I don&#39;t want to put *any* of the  <br/>\nkids in that situation. So, I&#39;m hoping to get some input here.
