It makes more sense to a younger child to divide - one for you, one for me, rather than &quot;take away one&quot; - fractions and parts of sets make more sense than counting backwards. One of the downsides of math education is that young kids spend so much time focused on subtraction they forget how to divide or never get to learn it naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Arithmetic (was Deschooling competitive perfectionists)","postDate":"1325790423","msgId":64739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPV1RHajQ5ekNKVkdoYTVNc3JVdEtHRks5aGttQ2M3X0xlLW16WFBVRTZhUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64753,"prevInTime":64738,"nextInTime":64740,"topicId":64739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
