I told her that driving to and from friend&#39;s houses <br/>\nwas part of our homeschooling costs, that it needed to be since her peer group <br/>\nisn&#39;t built around the neighborhood school, but that it&#39;s super nice when other <br/>\nparents share the driving.   It still is a big deal to her even though she <br/>\ndrives herself to the mall right by our house to go shopping.  She is like so <br/>\nmany other parents of teens, she has this built in idea that teens are somehow <br/>\nless deserving of rides, or somehow capable of getting themselves to and fro <br/>\neven without public transportation or cars or driver&#39;s licenses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s odd, but very very normal.  I&#39;ve had to pleasure to get to know all these <br/>\nwonderful kids by simply driving, or being available to drive.

It might be more accurate to say that people with a lot of interpersonal intelligence learn more from social interactions at school than they do from the curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be helpful for a parent who is wondering how to connect with a very social teen to look for ways to be more social with her - not just look for ways to socialize but work on communicating in a way that&#39;s more sociable. Parents can easily fall into a pattern where virtually all their interactions with their kids are a kind of teaching - even chit chat has imbedded lessons about this or that. Part of deschooling for parents is moving away from that kind of relationship and learning how to act like a friend. That&#39;s important with any kid, but all the more so with a kid who is very tuned in to social nuances.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; They can lose a lot of their individuality, their creativity and curiosity trying to fit in with their group.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re less likely to do that if they aren&#39;t stuck with just one group. School tends to pigeon hole kids into smaller groups, but parents can contribute to that, too. Putting down a young person&#39;s interests most often leads to that person clinging to his or her interests all the harder - and *that* does more to lock a young person in to one group than being a member of the group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Holt says in &quot;Escape From Childhood&quot;:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;...one reason why teenagers seem to be so preoccupied with such things [he had just mentioned their personal, emotional, and social lives] is that we do not allow them to be preoccupied with much of anything else.&quot;  p.160<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults also frame those kinds of interests in very negative way for teens, but frame those same interests in a positive light for adults. Its *noble* for adults to be concerned with issues of social justice, emotional and personal well-being, but when a teen is exploring those issues in the real (if narrow) world of school, its all just trivia. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling kids have the advantage of a wider world in which to explore big ideas about society and personal growth and - hopefully! - parents who are being supportive of those interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe parents who want to reconnect with their teens could find something to do that is part of the larger world, like volunteering at an animal shelter (animals!) or food bank or kitchen (cooking!), or collecting items for teen shelters (clothes!).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean suggest sharing those things with their teens or go off and &quot;set a good example&quot;? That&#39;s not clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good for parents to flip that idea around and see that seemingly small interests can and do tie in to the larger world and trust that your teen isn&#39;t oblivious to those connections, even if she&#39;s (or he&#39;s) not sharing those insights with you just now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: connecting with your always schooled teen","postDate":"1300207677","msgId":60265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrRHNIN2JqcVE2YXN5Y1BNalBNUUt1aS1zTGhSbkFvLURPa0VmS0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9V0NMS21oSjBURVlwX0ZuakNDcjlZS3FzRVA9bXE4b1o1SHVfc0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUwNzA5ODQ5MS0xMzAwMTA4NTcwLWNhcmRodV9kZWNvbWJvYnVsYXRvcl9ibGFja2JlcnJ5LnJpbS5uZXQtNTI3MTk3MDg5LUBiZGEyNjQwLmJpc3gucHJvZC5vbi5ibGFja2JlcnJ5Pgk8aWxtYzZjK3Q0aXVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1RpPVdDTEttaEowVEVZcF9GbmpDQ3I5WUtxc0VQPW1xOG9aNUh1X3NAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60261,"nextInTopic":60266,"prevInTime":60264,"nextInTime":60266,"topicId":60253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Correction: I want to add the word being to the following so that it makes sense.

And on the basis that you aren&#39;t<br/>\nhearing your daughter, she won&#39;t hear you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurprise yourself! Until having a son who is into games, I considered<br/>\nmyself a &quot;book&quot; person not a gamer type. Karl talks a lot about<br/>\nMinecraft and also other games. A new addition is Magicka.

I just talked on the phone yesterday with a 15 year<br/>\nold homeschooled nephew who told me about greyhounds, how they&#39;re<br/>\nraised and treated in order to make them racers, their particular<br/>\nstrengths and fragilities. And we talked about a lot of other things<br/>\ntoo. And I was the &quot;cat&quot; person, I thought, with lots of negative<br/>\nexperience with dogs.

That one little thing has been very hard for<br/>\nme at times. Another thing I&#39;m not passing down to Karl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in your case, you have others standing by to share those interests<br/>\nwith your daughter.

If they&#39;re still little, maybe you and your daughter could plan a family vacation.  Let her to a lot of the planning and decisionmaking.  Let her be a star, rather than a childcare assistant.  Being away from the house and away from the school might give you some time to create new shared memories.  It wouldn&#39;t be a magical turning point, but it would be a big step toward having a relationship with her.    Don&#39;t criticize her while you&#39;re on vacation if she wants to listen to her own music sometimes, or dress as she wants to, or text her friends, though.  If your plan is to isolate her, she might not even want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea I have is maybe to tell her, either on a long car ride where it&#39;s just the two of you, or in writing, maybe, that you wish your relationship could have been different, that you wish you knew then what you know now, or whatever it is you wish.  She might not respond immediately, but the ideas and the sentiments will be inside her, for her to process when and as she can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: connecting with your always schooled teen","postDate":"1300118084","msgId":60257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlsbGRvNCtmYW43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlsa3E3dis5ZXY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60256,"nextInTopic":60258,"prevInTime":60256,"nextInTime":60258,"topicId":60253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra has a lot of information about teens compiled on her site: http://sandradodd.com/teen/ My oldest just turned 17.

I was a very mouthy/bratty teen (we are best friends now, btw). Whenever I was up late studying or anxious and couldn&#39;t sleep, she&#39;d make me a glass of warm milk, bring it to me silently and leave a little encouraging note-an I love or or I believe in you, whatever. Knowing she was there was like having a strong bedrock beneath me. Sometimes, she&#39;d stay up with me all night then give me a free pass to go in or not go in the next day while she went to work. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlthough I was angry (part of he age) I knew she was there. I now do this with my teens and finds it works. I realize that costumes (hair, makeup, etc_ are just that. If they won&#39;t matter when she&#39;s 5 yrs older I don&#39;t say anything. My sd likes to wear really short skirts (bum showing). She&#39;s in the top clique-cheerleader. Our compromise was cheer spanks underneath. She&#39;s going to either wear it with my support or feel like she&#39;s going against us and in that moment feel she won but consequently feel we don&#39;t support her. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHang in there. Judge less, love more. &quot;Date&quot; her-cards, I love you/thinking of you gifts under her door, a gentle I&#39;m here for you timed right. She&#39;s searching for herself away from you. It&#39;s like when they were learning how to walk-they&#39;d stagger away, hang onto something, walk away, look back and maybe even yell at you if you started to come toward her to pick her up. Let her walk and be there to pick her up, without judgement, when she falls. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy father gave me the following advice for dealing with 12 teenage daughters: be deaf/dumb/blind as long as it won&#39;t kill them. That way, you both survive. :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt works for us with 2 in public school, 2 homeschooled (10th, 2 in 7th 1 in preschool). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGood luck!!!!\r<br/>\nSent on the Sprint� Now Network from my BlackBerry�\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: &quot;rubixscuba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebecca@...\">rebecca@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Mon, 14 Mar 2011 10:21:51 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] connecting with your always schooled teen\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ni could use some help figuring out how someone who is new to unschooling ideas/discovering unschooling &quot;late&quot; can find a way to make it work with an older child/teen who has always gone to school and actually loves it?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ni have recently become painfully aware of how difficult it is to find real quality time to spend with my 14 yo. since she goes to school and has all these things she wants to do with her friends after school i feel like i rarely have time with her. she is very peer oriented and in the popular clique at school (so weird to me since i was always a bit of a social misfit myself) and constantly texting and talking on the phone with her friends. hanging out with mom/younger siblings isn&#39;t interesting to her. it feels like she is a bit disconnected from the rest of the family (she also has a different dad, who is mostly absent from her life, so that complicates stuff).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nany ideas on how i can woo her back (she does not want to quit school)? do i immerse myself in her world to the extent she&#39;ll let me and build up our relationship? i can see myself finding joy in sharing interests with her, and i want to embrace her and her world, but if i am totally honest i find myself wanting her to have different interests. i don&#39;t value many of the things she likes, like current fashion trends, her taste in music or TV shows, her interest in makeup, hair and appearances and whatever else is popular right now...
