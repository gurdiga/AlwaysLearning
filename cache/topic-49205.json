I totally understand what you conveyed and that is how I see it.  The cry is a form of communication...it is always a cue.  Sometimes there is nothing for me to do other than be present, sometimes there is something I need to do.  So yes, I totally vibe you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not realize that I was a very angry person until I became a parent.  So with my older son I had to learn that children will do what children do and that it is my responsibility to just roll with it...keeping us all safe, helping us to learn to work together and truly seeking to enjoy the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once a mom who was trying to do everything the right way.  I have always leaned toward mindful parenting though I did not all time know what to do because I had a preset notion of what parenting entailed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then when I realized the mindful way of doing it I tried to do that the &quot;right way&quot;....but the disparity between me being mindful in public and a raging maniac at home was too evident for me to live like that for long.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I wrote the comment about not judging his cry, it had more to do with me learning that a child&#39;s cry is nothing personal against me and it is not a reflection on me as a person.

And so  <br/>\n&gt; the moms thought &quot;Oh!  It&#39;s okay for kids to be unhappy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s okay  <br/>\n&gt; for kids to cry,&quot; and rather than just accepting it as a legitimate  <br/>\n&gt; form of communication, it seems that sometimes the mom will ignore the  <br/>\n&gt; crying or the expressions of frustration, thinking that that&#39;s what it  <br/>\n&gt; means to &quot;not judge it as bad.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They go from the idea that a mother should demand a child shut up and  <br/>\n&gt; not cry, to accepting that a mother can just listen to the crying and  <br/>\n&gt; complaining and not do anything past reassure the child that it&#39;s okay  <br/>\n&gt; that he&#39;s crying.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not being really clear, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mindful parenting should ideally (in my version or vision of it)  <br/>\n&gt; involve the parents considering any noise or gestures from their  <br/>\n&gt; children as communication, and try from an early age to have such a  <br/>\n&gt; relationship with the child that both trust the other and are  <br/>\n&gt; attentive to the others&#39; moods and needs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Back to the top quote, one thing that helped us was if I did feel in a  <br/>\n&gt; hurry and a toddler wandered toward something interesting, I would go  <br/>\n&gt; too, and agree that it was very interesting, and work it into the next  <br/>\n&gt; few minutes&#39; conversation.

And so  <br/>\nthe moms thought &quot;Oh!  It&#39;s okay for kids to be unhappy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s okay  <br/>\nfor kids to cry,&quot; and rather than just accepting it as a legitimate  <br/>\nform of communication, it seems that sometimes the mom will ignore the  <br/>\ncrying or the expressions of frustration, thinking that that&#39;s what it  <br/>\nmeans to &quot;not judge it as bad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey go from the idea that a mother should demand a child shut up and  <br/>\nnot cry, to accepting that a mother can just listen to the crying and  <br/>\ncomplaining and not do anything past reassure the child that it&#39;s okay  <br/>\nthat he&#39;s crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not being really clear, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting should ideally (in my version or vision of it)  <br/>\ninvolve the parents considering any noise or gestures from their  <br/>\nchildren as communication, and try from an early age to have such a  <br/>\nrelationship with the child that both trust the other and are  <br/>\nattentive to the others&#39; moods and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the top quote, one thing that helped us was if I did feel in a  <br/>\nhurry and a toddler wandered toward something interesting, I would go  <br/>\ntoo, and agree that it was very interesting, and work it into the next  <br/>\nfew minutes&#39; conversation.   If it was mushrooms under a tree and we  <br/>\nwere on the way to the store, I could say &quot;Let&#39;s look at the mushrooms  <br/>\nat the store when we get there too,&quot; or something.  Rather than see  <br/>\nthe interesting thing as an isolated bit of excitement that we were  <br/>\nnow going to abandon forever, I&#39;d try to make a connection with  <br/>\nsomething else, helping the child feel like he was going toward,  <br/>\nrather than just away from.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Pet Peeve of the Year","postDate":"1261593470","msgId":49216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzQkFBQ0U4LTU2RkUtNEZBQy1BNzEyLTk4QTJEQ0VERjRDM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCMzI1QzJELjcwNjA2MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhnc3FsZCtsMTg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEIzMjRCRjguMzA1MDhAbWFjLmNvbT4gPENGNUU0RTFBLTVCOTItNDlEMC1BOEU1LURBRDEwMjZDRDFEN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDRCMzI1QzJELjcwNjA2MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49215,"nextInTopic":49217,"prevInTime":49215,"nextInTime":49217,"topicId":49205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I hear homeschooling/unschooling parents do the tour guide schtick a lot with their kids.

I remember those walks when my children were <br/>\nlittle, sometimes we didn&#39;t make it very far from our own front door <br/>\nbecause the kids would get involved with some leaves or puddles or the <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s cat. Sometimes I would just be there in the background, <br/>\nletting the kids have their own experience. Sometimes I might sort of <br/>\n&quot;reach in&quot; and add some little thing or turn over a rock or a leaf, <br/>\nknowing that it would enrich the experience. Sometimes I&#39;d be very <br/>\ninvolved - digging through the leaves with them, discussing something, <br/>\nshowing them how to be still and let the kitty come to them, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor it to be a really good metaphor, though, it should include the <br/>\nparent choosing different places to start the walk - the park, the <br/>\nbeach, a different neighborhood, even just starting a different <br/>\ndirection out the door - different times of day, different times of <br/>\nyear, carrying different things along. And a parent will be ready and <br/>\nprepared with ideas - &quot;You could roll down that hill,&quot; &quot;Let&#39;s go watch <br/>\nthe construction workers,&quot; &quot;I brought bread to feed the ducks.&quot; The <br/>\nparent should look for ways to be helpful. Lift the child onto walls to <br/>\nwalk on top of them. Help him leap over big puddles. Help him drag large <br/>\npieces of driftwood or big branches. Hold the kitty gently while he pets <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a line that is important to draw between offering ideas, <br/>\ninformation, help, advice versus controlling the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing for a walk with a toddler is a really good way to learn about that <br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help you later, when your toddler is a teenager.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: advice / help please ..","postDate":"1261586739","msgId":49210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQwMDkwOTJBQTMyNzQ2RjI5OTU3N0Q5MUFCMjRBQ0U5QExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhnc3FsZCtsMTg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhnc3FsZCtsMTg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49209,"nextInTopic":49211,"prevInTime":49209,"nextInTime":49211,"topicId":49205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If I had to go and get him and he got mad after a while it was no biggie because I realized that two year olds get mad at time when their parents pick them up and begin going in a different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if I have time I will explain to the child what is going on.  Nothing too indepth.  I will seek to point out different objects on the path to maybe help him shift his mind to something else.  Personally, the biggest thing for me was to not judge my son&#39;s crying and not liking the situation as bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as I choose a peaceful response then the situation always turned out alright.  After a while...especially when they get older then I set up the expectation.  I will say, &quot;you can go over there but after 15 minutes, we are leaving.  I will give them heads up.  We have 5 minutes before time to leave.&quot;  &quot;We are leaving in one minute.&quot;  My thing is to always do my best to not abruptly end what my child is doing but to give the child heads up...heck I probably started this during the two year for both my sons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, after a while a child will mature and realize that we will come back to the place.  I can even say to maybe a 3 or 4 year old, &quot;We will come back tomorrow.&quot;  The only thing that will stop me from going back is a really bad situation...otherwise I must bring the child back when I said that I would so that it is now a trust relationship being built and over time with more maturity the resistance to leaving is resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace <br/>\nTirra<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Know Thyself.&quot;  Oracles of Delphi<br/>\nDo you really know yourself or do you only know what you have been conditioned to believe about yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nNeverFear a Job Loss!
