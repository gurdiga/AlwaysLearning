We got a<br/>\ngeriatric chocolate lab a few months ago to complete our dog-family,<br/>\nsince Nana at that point had decided that she was *my* dog. As it turned<br/>\nout, Nana really enjoys dog-company and has made many dog-friends,<br/>\nalthough Keith, our new dog, is a lab and therefore believes he&#39;s really<br/>\na person, and tends to prefer to socialize with people rather than dogs.<br/>\nAnyway, Nana seemed to learn a lot about how dogs should act by watching<br/>\nKeith, so now she&#39;s much more bonded to Rain from following Keith&#39;s<br/>\nexample with her. It&#39;s all been very interesting to watch...<br/>\n<br/>\nNana is still cautious in new situations but she&#39;s much faster at warming<br/>\nup, and if someone new takes a couple of minutes to talk to her gently<br/>\nshe&#39;ll generally go over to that person and ask to be petted. She&#39;s<br/>\npretty good at basic obedience, although she does a very deferential<br/>\n&quot;come&quot; where she won&#39;t come right to my front but curves off to the<br/>\nside... and &quot;down&quot; makes her nervous.. but she can do the more unusual<br/>\nstuff like &quot;go to bed&quot; (her crate) when I tell her to, even from 2 rooms<br/>\naway, and &quot;drop it&quot;, shouted across a field when she finds some farm<br/>\nworker&#39;s leftover lunch (Keith, OTOH, pretends he&#39;s gone temporarily deaf<br/>\nuntil he gobbles it all up... and during tomato season, during every walk<br/>\nhe gobbled 3 or 4 squashed tomatoes that had fallen from the trucks). We<br/>\nwere playing around with some search and rescue training... we&#39;ve<br/>\ndiscovered that she really likes pepperoni, so we use those for treats.<br/>\nShe&#39;s getting there... with Keith, he learns fast but he doesn&#39;t do well<br/>\nlearning things that require him to actually figure somehting out... with<br/>\nNana, she can almost read my mind, but anything new makes her nervous, so<br/>\nit takes time...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did mean to send photos, but she still gets nervous when I aim a<br/>\ncamera at her. Actually, I took some non-digital photos and still need to<br/>\nget them developed, is your address the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
