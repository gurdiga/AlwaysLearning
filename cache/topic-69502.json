Those photos of him with his family (you can click &quot;next&quot; from the cake photo) are very sweet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who&#39;s unfamiliar with my page about cake, it came about because of a conversation with my boys when they were little, while we were watching Spartacus.  Something Kirby said gave me a big idea about cake as sacrifice, and I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since.

There was a little phrase in the middle (like &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;in a way&quot; and I&#39;d  need to listen to the article again to get it solidly, but it&#39;s in a bit about Mad Magazine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI started subscribing to Mad Magazine in 1967, though I had a collection of issues I had bought at the store before that.  I wish I still had every sngle one.  I didn&#39;t yet have he strength of personality to tell my friends and family they were wrong to razz me about my interests, and that those magazines had done more good for me than most of them ever would.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned to make mobiles from one Mad Magazine had as a tagboard centerfold in one issue.  I kept that for years, and wish I still had it.  I still have that issue, but not the mobile.  But I&#39;ve made one huge mobile that hung from the vaulted ceiling of our school cafeteria when I was 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing said about that magazine in the article was that it helped young kids think about things that adults wouldn&#39;t explain to them, and that even older kids wouldn&#39;t take the time and trouble to explain.   When I&#39;ve looked at it in recent years, it didn&#39;t seem as funny, but it&#39;s because I&#39;m not fourteen anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in a solid, healthy unschooling family, there shoudln&#39;t be things that kids wouldn&#39;t be able to ask parents or older siblings. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to a testimonial for popular culture and humor over college, there&#39;s one by Weird Al, who studied architecture, I think it was, at San Luis Obispo, all the time being a musician and composer. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69438,"nextTopicId":69512}}
