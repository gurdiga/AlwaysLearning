My husband&#39;s parents <br/>\nwere also alcoholics, although that is not something anyone in their <br/>\nfamily discusses as both his parents are dead.  My parents were very <br/>\nopen with alcohol.  If I wanted a glass, I was able to help myself.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure when this started, but probably at about 10 or so.  They <br/>\nprobably did what I am doing, which is letting my children have sips of <br/>\nwhatever I have, with a glass themselves at special occassions.  Lexie <br/>\nhas asked for a glass of champaigne and I complied.  She didn&#39;t drink <br/>\nit, beyond a few sips.  Janene likes beer and has drank more than a sip <br/>\nof mine, with my permission.  As Lexie gets older, she&#39;ll be able to <br/>\nhave whatever she wishes, within reason.  Same with her friends, <br/>\nalthough I will need to have permission of their parents or know them <br/>\nvery well (her best friend has parents who do as we do, so I would not <br/>\nhave a problem letting this child have wine or beer and in fact, I <br/>\nthink, already have, although it&#39;s been in the form of tasting from my <br/>\nown glass, at least one time in her parent&#39;s house.)  My parents, by the <br/>\ntime I was in my teens, would buy me wine on request (I liked red at the <br/>\ntime, and they drank white so I generally had to ask to get the type I <br/>\nwanted).  I also would request beer on occassion, although I was happy <br/>\nto drink my dad&#39;s if he had some around.  My parents used to drink more <br/>\nthan they do now, and my dad would have 1-2 drinks a day usually while <br/>\nmy mom was a 1-2 drink per week, if that.  I go through phases when I <br/>\ndrink a glass or two every day and then I go through phases where I go <br/>\nfor months without touching the stuff.  All is normal and I want my <br/>\nchildren to see this.  There has been a few occassions when Lexie has <br/>\ntaken it upon herself to poor me a glass of wine unbidden and I found <br/>\nthat a sweet thing to do.  Once I asked her to bring me a glass and she <br/>\nwas taking the longest time but I was busy doing something and didn&#39;t <br/>\nnotice until she came up with the new bottle of wine and the corkscrew <br/>\nalmost out, and said &quot;I ALMOST did it mom, but I can&#39;t get it out the <br/>\nlast bit&quot; and I was rather proud that my eight year old figured out how <br/>\nto use the corkscrew.  ;-)  Lexie is also aware of how food effects <br/>\nalcohol, and has said, when we go out, mom, if you have a glass of wine <br/>\nnow and then eat, you&#39;ll be OK to drive.  but only ONE glass of wine.  :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think modeling good drinking habits and teaching moderation will go a <br/>\nlong way toward prevention of addiction.  My mom used to say &quot;if you <br/>\nWANT a glass of wine, go ahead but if you NEED a glass of wine, you need <br/>\nto rethink things.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nLexie and I were talking about pot the other day and an anti drug <br/>\ncommercial that loops all the drugs as being the same evil, and her <br/>\nideas on why pot was not so bad were pretty sophisticated.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout it a lot.  I&#39;ve told her that if she wants to try pot, I&#39;d like <br/>\nfor her to please come to me so we could find some that was pretty pure <br/>\n(or grow it ourselves) because of the risk of it being laced with acid <br/>\nor something she didn&#39;t want to try.  I&#39;d also rather her try it with me <br/>\n(I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d actually smoke pot again, at this point in my life <br/>\nI&#39;d say no, I&#39;m too much of a control freak and I am not in control when <br/>\ndrunk or on drugs, but I would be with her while she did so).  She&#39;s <br/>\nvery aware of medical uses for pot and agrees that it should be legal.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve also spent time talking about the risks of breaking any law, but <br/>\nespecially laws regarding drugs, and how we must measure the risks vs <br/>\nthe benefits or desire to try a drug. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my parents pretty liberal views on drinking and their kids paid <br/>\noff.  Of my four grandparents, all but one was either a drug addict or <br/>\nalcoholic. Both my uncles and my one aunt are also drug <br/>\naddicts/alcoholics (although everyone is in recovery and has been for <br/>\nyears.)  My parents had three children (two biologically) and all of us <br/>\nare very mild drinkers.  I plan to follow their lead as this is one area <br/>\nparenting wise in which I think they did pretty good.  :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Patti<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

From the snopes.com site:<br/>\n&quot;The<br/>\nclaim that this essay is &quot;from Paul Harvey&quot; is ambiguous — does it mean he <br/>\nwrote the essay, or that he popularized it? It&#39;s unclear which concept the <br/>\nwriter of the e-mail was trying to communicate, so we&#39;ll answer both questions in <br/>\npreference to guessing what was in that person&#39;s mind. <br/>\nPaul Harvey certainly didn&#39;t write the essay. The true author of this piece <br/>\nis Lee Pitts, and the nostalgic essay was published in his 1995 book People Who <br/>\nLive At The End of Dirt Roads and appeared in the 2000 book Chicken Soup for <br/>\nthe Golden Soul. <br/>\nPaul Harvey does use material written by Lee Pitts from time to time, and he <br/>\ndid read this particular essay (crediting Pitts, of course) during his 6 <br/>\nSeptember 1997 broadcast. &quot;<br/>\nHere&#39;s the actual essay.  I think it&#39;s better this way, not so vindictive:<br/>\nWe tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. <br/>\nFor my grandchildren, I’d know better. <br/>\nI’d really like for them to know about hand-me-down clothes and home-made ice <br/>\ncream and leftover meatloaf. I really would. <br/>\nMy cherished grandson, I hope you learn humility by surviving failure and <br/>\nthat you learn to be honest even when no one is looking. <br/>\nI hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car — and I <br/>\nhope nobody gives you a brand-new car when you are sixteen. <br/>\nIt will be good if at least one time you can see a baby calf born, and you <br/>\nhave a good friend to be with you if you ever have to put your old dog to sleep. <br/>\nI hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in. <br/>\nI hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it is all <br/>\nright to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl <br/>\nunder the covers with you because he’s scared, I hope you’ll let him. <br/>\nAnd when you want to see a Disney movie and your kid brother wants to tag <br/>\nalong, I hope you take him. <br/>\nI hope you have to walk uphill with your friends and that you live in a town <br/>\nwhere you can do it safely. <br/>\nIf you want a slingshot, I hope your father teaches you how to make one <br/>\ninstead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books, and when <br/>\nyou learn to use computers, you also learn how to add and subtract in your <br/>\nhead. <br/>\nI hope you get razzed by friends when you have your first crush on a girl, <br/>\nand that when you talk back to your mother you learn what Ivory soap tastes <br/>\nlike. <br/>\nMay you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on the stove and <br/>\nstick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. <br/>\nI hope you get sick when someone blows smoke in your face. I don’t care if <br/>\nyou try beer once, but I hope you won’t like it. And if a friend offers you a <br/>\njoint or any drugs, I hope you are smart enough to realize that person is not <br/>\nyour friend. <br/>\nI sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your grandpa or go fishing <br/>\nwith your uncle. <br/>\nI hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through a neighbor’<br/>\ns window, and that she hugs you and kisses you when you give her a plaster of <br/>\nparis mold of your hand. <br/>\nThese things I wish for you — tough times and disappointment, hard work and <br/>\nhappiness<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] a wish for my grandchildren","postDate":"1082584249","msgId":19339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFlLjU1ZGJmMjVkLjJkYjg0NmI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19338,"nextInTopic":19340,"prevInTime":19338,"nextInTime":19340,"topicId":19336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/2004 5:45:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ... send around emails that people forward I thought your responses were well thought out and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1899283719\">In a message dated 4/21/2004 5:45:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pennacres@...\">pennacres@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is probably redundant but of course you know this is one of those <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;send around emails that people forward&quot;<br/>\nI thought your responses were well thought out and reflected your own take on <br/>\nthings.Your father in law should get a bolt up his butt and have a longer <br/>\nlook at stuff before he sends it on.....hopefully?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah----he&#39;s sent it twice already.

Surrounded by<br/>\n&gt; dirt and books, digging and reading happen naturally.<br/>\n&gt; When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; your head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Surrounded by numbers.....adding and subtracting happens naturally.<br/>\nComputers<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even enter in to it.<br/>\n&gt; I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a<br/>\n&gt; boy&#92;girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory<br/>\nsoap<br/>\n&gt; tastes like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Friends who will tease you for loving someone aren&#39;t friends. And a mother<br/>\n&gt; who will impose such a punishment is only worthy of being talked back to!<br/>\n&gt; Both of these wishes are down-right despicable! What horrible things to<br/>\nwish<br/>\n&gt; on a child! Maybe you should have YOUR mouth washed out with soap!<br/>\n&gt; May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and<br/>\n&gt; stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again!  Despicable! Purposefully wishing pain upon a child? What kind of<br/>\n&gt; man/father are you?<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don&#39;t like it. And if<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What makes beer so offensive? &quot;Try it, but I hope you don&#39;t like it?&quot; What<br/>\n&gt; kind of wish is that? I guess you don&#39;t drink? Both my boys drink wine and<br/>\nbeer.<br/>\n&gt; Neither care for hard liquor. Personal tastes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I had many friends who offered me joints. I&#39;ve never smoked. But they<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; still my friends. Who are YOU to judge my friends?<br/>\n&gt; I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; fishing with your Uncle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not if these are his wishes for his grandchildren! I&#39;d rather my children<br/>\n&gt; stay far, far away from you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Funerals are barbaric. And holidays filled with people who believe this<br/>\ncrap<br/>\n&gt; cannot possibly be filled with joy.<br/>\n&gt; I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your<br/>\n&gt; neighbor&#39;s window and that she hugs you and kisses you at<br/>\nHanukah/Christmas time<br/>\n&gt; when you give her a plaster mold of your hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would hope that I would understand that it was an ACCIDENT and help my<br/>\n&gt; child find a way to make restitution----just as I would if it happened to<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; husband or to a friend. And I will give hugs and kisses for no reason<br/>\nwhat-so-ever<br/>\n&gt; other than that he is my son.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; happiness. To me, it&#39;s the only way to appreciate life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only way to appreciate life is to have one. A good one. Being dealt<br/>\n&gt; punishments and unkindness because you are a child is humiliating and<br/>\nshameful and<br/>\n&gt; should not be tolerated in decent society. A child who is routinely----and<br/>\n&gt; purposefully---maltreated as you suggest above will NOT appreciate his<br/>\nlife, Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Harvey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t my sons&#39; grandfather.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
