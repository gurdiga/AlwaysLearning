Although, to be honest, I only just found out about this after he moved out suddenly 10 days ago.

In spite of all that, I want to do it in a way that honors my daughter&#39;s journey. I figure if she really is as ready as she seems, and is as determined as she seems, then if I can find the right tools for her, it could happen. Or at least we could pick up some &quot;tricks&quot; (as some suggested) along the way that would allow my husband to see some progress and relax, and give us some breathing room.<br/>\nI know the pressure of our situation is going to probably hinder her progress right now.

Chances are, she&#39;s Not interested in hours of frustration and feeling stupid and inept! So what does she really want? The independence of reading without you? Look for audio books, read-alongs, and subtitled shows and movies. Does she want the luxury of being able to read the same thing over and over without mom sighing in frustration? That&#39;s an easy fix ;) Does she need a &quot;trick&quot; to show grandma or the neighbors? Help her find another cool trick to show off. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;So I feel that I need some ideas for suggesting to her that we could do if she wants to.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she not like to be read to at all? Read to her as much as she wants. If, like my daughter, she&#39;s not a fan of speech, look at pictures together, and diagrams and charts. Do you have any of the really simple books where everything in the picture is labeled? Those were handy for Mo. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that if daughter&#39;s not ready, it won&#39;t matter what you do, you&#39;ll end up with a frustrated little girl. If she&#39;s ready, she&#39;ll start reading things - that sounds like some kind of magic trick, but learning to read works like learning to walk or speak. A kid who likes a good puzzle will start puzzling out phonetic correspondences using clues like the alphabet song, or arranging the magnetic letters on your fridge (if you don&#39;t have any, get some) and asking you to pronounce them. Other kids will start reciting books along with mom while reading, or shout out words at appropriate times in the text, or pointing out street signs. Not all those things will lead directly to reading, but those are all examples of what kids do while learning to read. If she&#39;s doing things like that but not reading on her own, chances are she&#39;s not ready yet, or she&#39;s still building a collection of words she recognizes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it still may be important for you to offer reassurance and distraction, if she&#39;s not really ready to read. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321996436,"authorName":"Alex","from":"&quot;Alex&quot; &lt;missalexmissalex@...&gt;","profile":"missalexmissalex","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: learning to read?","postDate":"1343321347","msgId":68360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1cnNlMythbjJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBCOTZFRjRDLTg1MkEtNDY5QS05MjFFLTkyOUY0MzNBRjI1QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":68359,"nextInTopic":68361,"prevInTime":68359,"nextInTime":68361,"topicId":68324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m trying to make perfectly clear what people are saying.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is supporting kids in exploring what interests them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT if you believe some program will unlock the mysteries of reading for her -- and support her in believing it too -- *and* she&#39;s not developmentally ready to read, you&#39;re likely setting her up to feel she&#39;s at fault for not being able to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads into: Second, and most important, even if she has a goal she might not be developmentally able to read yet. *If her brain isn&#39;t developmentally ready to decode* no amount of games or reading will make it ready. Her brain needs to grow more connections (or whatever it does). And that comes with time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLive life joyfully. Support her in what she wants to explore. But *DO* let her know her brain might not have grown enough yet to be ready to read. That she *will* read when her brain has grown enough to do what it needs to do to read. If her brain isn&#39;t ready, she can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can liken it to some lack of height issue she may have had. No matter how much she strained, no amount of wanting was going to make her tall enough to reach that light switch or faucet. (Or something she physically wanted to do that her body hadn&#39;t grown enough for.) And then one day she *had* grown enough and then she could reach it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be just the same with reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead to her if she wants to.  Get Peggy Kaye&#39;s Reading Games book and play some games if she wants to. Make available games on line that involve words that she enjoys, even games that are specifically for reading.

But it won&#39;t teach kids to read. Kids who are ready to read, kids who learn best by building a whole from parts (rather than absorbing wholes and breaking them down into parts) will probably find it fun.

When kids are ready to walk, they pull themselves up. When kids are developmentally ready to read, they start decoding.
