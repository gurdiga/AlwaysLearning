The previous poster said something about having <br/>\nvery little money but not expecting the child to contribute to the <br/>\nhousehold at 16, only at 18...because he is a legal adult then? I <br/>\nwould think if i was really having a hard time putting food on the <br/>\ntable, that whoever had a job in the family (whether they were 12, <br/>\nor 16, or 18)might want to contribute as much as they could. I <br/>\nborrowed my son&#39;s birthday money to pay a bill, and he was fine with <br/>\nthat. I told him i&#39;d pay it back in January when things are a little <br/>\neasier....he even told me not to worry about it, i could keep it (it <br/>\nwas over $100!) Of course i will give it back to him, but he is very <br/>\ngenerous. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo i dunno....is 18 just an arbitrary age, in an unschooling family, <br/>\nor is there something especially magical and significant about that <br/>\nage that i should prepare myself for?<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23614,"nextTopicId":23616}}
