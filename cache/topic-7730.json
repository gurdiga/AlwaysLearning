First of all I realized that I want to include much more than just<br/>\nthat small community, I want this publication to be by and for any<br/>\nself-educators, autodidacts, life-long learners, etc, who are interested in<br/>\nit.  I want this publication to help build a community of life-long<br/>\nlearning, far beyond just NBTSC/QV-G.  Secondly I realized that<br/>\n&quot;Newsletter&quot; wasn&#39;t going to cut it -- I want articles and stories and<br/>\npoetry!  I realized that what I was really thinking of was more of a<br/>\nmagazine.  I expect it will be a fairly freeform magazine, because I&#39;m not<br/>\ninterested in sticking to a set idea of what a &quot;magazine&quot; is, I&#39;m<br/>\ninterested in creating a forum for this community to communicate with,<br/>\nentertain, and inspire each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to give you a very brief overview, this magazine will contain articles,<br/>\nstories, poetry, reviews, resource sharing, announcements, shameless<br/>\nself-promotion, and whatever y&#39;all dream up.  The idea is to interest,<br/>\ninspire, and collaborate with each other on just about anything.  One thing<br/>\nI want to see a lot of is articles written about topics you find absolutely<br/>\nfascinating, written to inspire other people to get fascinated about said<br/>\ntopics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, check out http://www.nbtsc.org/wiki/QVMagazine  (soon<br/>\nto be http://magazine.quovadis-gathering.org, but NOT YET!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the important point:<br/>\n<br/>\n***I need contributions!***<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to get the first issue of QVM up by mid August, i.e., before this<br/>\nyear&#39;s NBTSC.  However, I need some time to compile the issue, and if I get<br/>\nenough stuff to make an issue sooner than that, it&#39;ll happen sooner, so<br/>\nSEND ME CONTRIBUTIONS!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis magazine can&#39;t happen without you!  Check out the link above, see what<br/>\nyou think, and then send me writing contributions.  I may have some theme<br/>\nissues, but I also plan to have some fairly chaotic issues with a random<br/>\nspattering of different topics and subjects covered, so send me anything<br/>\nthat -you- are passionate about.  (I of course reserve the right to publish<br/>\nor not publish anything, entirely based on my own whim.)  Also, this being<br/>\na free publication and all, I&#39;m not gonna pay anyone for contributions, as<br/>\nfar as I&#39;m concerned the writing is yours, and when you send it to me<br/>\nthat&#39;s permission for me to publish it, on the internet and as paper copies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I foresee it, the idea is that this will be an on-line magazine, and I<br/>\nwill keep an e-mail notification list to let people know when a new issue<br/>\nis up.  (I plan to use -this- e-mail list for the notification list, so<br/>\nplease tell me if you would like to be taken off.)  For people who can&#39;t<br/>\nget on-line, I will send people paper copies if they need them, for a small<br/>\nfee, but I want to have this mostly be an on-line magazine, for three<br/>\nreasons: Postage, paper use, and work for me.  Note: I plan to have the<br/>\nmagazine available in an easily printable format, and will happily allow<br/>\nanyone to print as many copy&#39;s as they wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing: Tell people about this!  If you know people who you think<br/>\nwould be interested in this, tell them about it!  (and if you have their<br/>\ne-mail handy, send it to me and I&#39;ll put them on the list!)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo contact me, e-mail me at zakarria@...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, PLEASE contact me if you want any of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nTo send me writing contributions.<br/>\nTo be taken off this list and never hear from me again.<br/>\nTo tell me somebody you know would just -love- this and they should be on<br/>\nmy list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7728,"nextTopicId":7737}}
