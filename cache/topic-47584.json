There are things she is sensitive to that might not seem scary to others (we say &quot;balloon&quot; instead of blood and &quot;butterfly&quot; instead of vomit/puke).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just started watching scooby doo and doesn&#39;t usually find it scary. she watched an old Sonic cartoon yesterday and it scared her (I was nursing her sister to sleep in another room). <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s getting interested in monsters, especially werewolves. I haven&#39;t had any luck finding any books at the library or the bookstore that are sort of an &quot;encyclopedia of monsters&quot; but isn&#39;t too graphic. Books are my first choice of info, not hers :-) but I also think still pictures might be less intense than a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried watching Teen Wolf, but the story didn&#39;t grab her and the wolf effects weren&#39;t wolf-like enough for her. I know there are lots of werewolf movies, but I can&#39;t think of any that won&#39;t be too intense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a big fan of monster movies myself, so I am excited to share these with her when she&#39;s ready. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had lots of great conversations about how they make movies and how the make up works. I&#39;ve showed some &quot;making of&quot; features on regular movies so she can see the camera and lighting and all the extra people.

Books are my first choice of info, not hers :-) but I also think still pictures might be less intense than a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried watching Teen Wolf, but the story didn&#39;t grab her and the wolf effects weren&#39;t wolf-like enough for her.
