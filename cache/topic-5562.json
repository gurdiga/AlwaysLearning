He and his dad built<br/>\na lovely bookshelf for our dining room.  The bookshelf, it turns out, was<br/>\njust the right size to fit at the top of the stairs in Dylan&#39;s room so<br/>\nthere it is. (I&#39;m still confused as to how that happened.) But he&#39;s been<br/>\nup there rearranging books and putting things away.    Good thing there&#39;s<br/>\na table in the dining room for that stack of books and the microscope and<br/>\nthe plate of deceased bugs from Arkansas and the Legos.  Good thing we<br/>\nusually eat in front of the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh has been off work for a few weeks ( sounds like he&#39;s quitting a drug<br/>\nhabit ) and we&#39;ve been busy going and doing.   We&#39;re expecting lots of<br/>\ncompany for my moms 80th birthday next week.  The news of their arrival<br/>\ncame just as we began a remodel of our kitchen.   Maybe, if they get<br/>\nhungry enough, the work will get done faster?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, you&#39;re brave!   I know that list needs your voice, and I&#39;m glad<br/>\nyou joined again.  I have considered going back but the thought of<br/>\nlistening to people complain about all the things that are wrong with<br/>\ntheir kids turns my stomach.   I think debates about what is or isn&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling are wonderful.  I think the more talk there is the more<br/>\nopportunity for new people to get a clear picture, sooner.  I just can&#39;t<br/>\nstand the folks who pile disorders on their  kids as an excuse for their<br/>\nparenting.   Lots of questioning parents there will benefit from your<br/>\nwisdom.  Good for you.   ( And get yourself some Malox ) <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5567,"nextTopicId":5577}}
