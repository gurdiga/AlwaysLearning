I may have just stumbled <br/>\n  on  what i have been looking for.<br/>\n  We have a 12 (13 in two weeks))year old. That we have adopted last <br/>\n  year.(she has lived with us for 3  1/2 years)who had sever pts. and <br/>\n  adhd.she was  abused in every way and  under feed and  had been <br/>\n  dionosed with reactive attachment disorder at the age of  five (we <br/>\n  did not know this till she was almost 12). She has come a long long <br/>\n  way and had grown  a lot as now she gets feed (she was 55 lbs and  <br/>\n  wore a  6x in clouthing, when we got her and now wears a womans  6 <br/>\n  tall and weighs 120.(giggle she wore a size 4 in childrens shoes then <br/>\n  now a 10 in womans)she trys very very hard  and is  recently wanting <br/>\n  to   frow more. she loves to learn and is determined to get past the  <br/>\n  RAD (reactive attachment Disorder). her and I have both  desided we <br/>\n  need to work harder on the  bonding as the theropist thinks we need <br/>\n  to work  on the adhd part and  use more drug theropy.( we have tryed <br/>\n  this over and overusuly makes it worse) we have agreed to try  time <br/>\n  relised this may however   we have refused the if you want to give <br/>\n  another to counter the first routine we wont do it)and we are both  <br/>\n  asking why  is it more important to  do the  grade thing any way<br/>\n  i have spent 3 years fighting the school. and trying to make them <br/>\n  fallow the iep, They have  insisted that we fix the not turning in <br/>\n  homework problem and fix the behavior also. The behavior is usuly  <br/>\n  social problems and she is  the kid every one picks on the kids and <br/>\n  teacher tell me this. Lisa  has very very poor social skills.so my <br/>\n  question  this last year to them has beenyou belive i need to keep <br/>\n  her in here for social reasons and what i see her learning is how to <br/>\n  be a door mat and  you say she is eager to learn but you dont have <br/>\n  time to teach her because she ask so many questions and  in the <br/>\n  classes she has  only 3 other students  she does great even helps <br/>\n  explain to others once she  has had all her questions answered. and <br/>\n  she is still flunking because she dont turn in her homework and if <br/>\n  she dont do the homework it is usualy because  the teaches have <br/>\n  failed to expline it in small steps so she can understand. And i keep <br/>\n  her in  school why? then they point out my spelling and  math  <br/>\n  problem and math is one of her problems.We dont have a lot of money <br/>\n  and they know it, know i could not afford to hire a bunch of tutors <br/>\n  and they  said i would have to turn my home into a mini school  to <br/>\n  make it work and hire  people to do it and if i didnt have the  <br/>\n  money  no way i could do this. i have spent 6 mounths  looking. have <br/>\n  found  that maybe they are wrong. there are lots of  places i could <br/>\n  open enroll her and as close as  a 1/2 hour away there are  places <br/>\n  that have  home school resorese rooms. and as for spelling  her and i <br/>\n  decided together that it could be a game and we  write down words we <br/>\n  spell wrong and  we keep list short  and  play a game to teach both <br/>\n  of us.I stared  with telling her i think it might be a idea for us to <br/>\n  do home  school stuff this summer when   u get out of school end of <br/>\n  may and i expected the  school in summer thing. to my surprise she <br/>\n  had ideas and  is excited about the idea and even said this is a way <br/>\n  we can work on the bonding issue mom, but what about math i told her <br/>\n  of the other types of school she said gee then  not every one will <br/>\n  know me and maybe i could make friends?                        <br/>\n    We make  biweekly trips to  junk stores usualy she hits the  <br/>\n  clouthing fast last 2 times she has went to learning  area and found <br/>\n  cd&#39;s  and books she would like to learn from.<br/>\n    Her counsler  now says she will fall behind  and that there is not <br/>\n  enough social interreaction  for her  . Her and I belive that  this <br/>\n  can be handled and I think learning  low self esteem and flunking <br/>\n  even though ya know the  materal is silly. The teacher dont fallow <br/>\n  the iep at all  we once had it set up to sigh a paper if she had <br/>\n  turned in home work and for every day she   got full day of <br/>\n  signutures she got  computer time . if she didnt get them she  didnt <br/>\n  and then if she missed 3 in a day she got a 1/2 hour in her roomthey <br/>\n  all sighned  every day for months. then sent home a  your kid is <br/>\n  flunking because she didnt turn in homework . The poor girl went into <br/>\n  tears. they had told her she was doing fine and  this took us both  <br/>\n  by surprise. i marched in to the school  and getting nothing but run <br/>\n  around called a  iep meeting they told me they didnt have heart not <br/>\n  to sighn the paper and as time went on  they  felt she handt turned  <br/>\n  it in because they didnt have time to teach her in small steps and <br/>\n  she was  behind/ I stoped the sighing thing told them what i was <br/>\n  thinking about home school and they  told me i lacked the skills and <br/>\n  that i would be doing  her a &quot;grave dis service&quot; if i did that and <br/>\n  quoted both her poor social skills and  the time it would take to  do <br/>\n  it. I shook my head  social skills? she is made fun of (granted <br/>\n  sometimes she causes it) and has no friends (small small towns dont <br/>\n  forgive and have long memorys) and as for my skills well i pionted <br/>\n  out to them i took a kid they told me would neve bond and couldnt <br/>\n  feel and that would end up in  instatutions the rest of her life and <br/>\n  she not been in a single instution, and  now we are trying to get her <br/>\n  to stop crying in school when she is made fun of.I think i keep <br/>\n  hesatiting because  so many tell me i am wrong i cant do this one  <br/>\n  that she will be at 7th grade level forever, if i do. except in <br/>\n  reading  where she reads at level 12.I think they  dont know my kid <br/>\n  and my determation. I think  ok so we both hate math and  have what <br/>\n  they call a math disorder. so what  we are integelent and read well <br/>\n  and she has so many questions and willness to find the answers. (oh i <br/>\n  probley forgot to say this child is  related to me by blood and other <br/>\n  reason they said with RAd kids bio related not a good idea asked me <br/>\n  to give her to system after we found  out  after a year and a 1/2)<br/>\n  So my questions are any one know if  this is bad idea for a teen Rad? <br/>\n  and is it to late as she is  almost 13 to start ?if her and i choose  <br/>\n  what  she does  why is that wrong? I kept saying so what she learns <br/>\n  what she can or wants in  math and i dont turn my home into a mini <br/>\n  school. we will find things she does want to learn. and she does want <br/>\n  to learn . heck  she out and out flunking  sience and those are one <br/>\n  the areas she keep picking up at the stores she wasnts to  do it on <br/>\n  computer the  woman i  have do my taxes say in Iowa there is a tax <br/>\n  break  and fed she says  if i keep track  what i spend for learning I <br/>\n  can claim 25 hundred on taxes.

What I think <br/>\nshe needs is the educrats out of her life and time to HEAL.   This is the <br/>\nbest opportunity you will ever have to give it to her.  It sounds to me like <br/>\nshe would be better off leaving school today and learning about herself and <br/>\nnot what a bunch of people who do not love her or have her best interests <br/>\nthink she should learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have an amazing, unique and sterling opportunity to present an awesome <br/>\ngift to her.  And that gift is simply time to BE.  Take her out of school <br/>\nTODAY.  Bond with her by letting her be.  Give her freedom to be who she is.  <br/>\nLet her be.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13899,"nextTopicId":13909}}
