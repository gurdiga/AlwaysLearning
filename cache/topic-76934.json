She also has asthma & allergies. I went through a period for a few years where I tightly controlled our food in hopes that doing so would improve my daughter&#39;s health.  Well guess what- controlling her diet never did resolve her health issues but controlling her food definitely created conflict in our relationship. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen we started unschooling I stopped my controlling and she started exploring all of the foods that had been previously forbidden. For over a year she ate those previously forbidden foods almost exclusively and had no interest in the foods that she ate during the controlled period. We would search the aisles of the grocery store looking for foods that appealed to her. We bought variety packs so she & her brother could try lots of different things. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI would promise her that I was never going to go back to controlling her food and she would look me dead in the eye and say &quot;I don&#39;t believe you.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt took a long time and a pattern of being trustworthy to earn her trust back. Eventually she returned to choosing foods because they felt and tasted good, not because they had been previously forbidden. Once her emotions around food finally settled back down I realized that she was choosing basically the same foods that she&#39;d chosen during her pre-controlled years. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nShe has always known what her body needs more than I have. That makes sense since she&#39;s the one living in it!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere&#39;s the biggest thing I&#39;ve noticed with this experience - when I stopped controlling her food and started implementing unschooling principles HER HEALTH GOT BETTER.  Asthma symptoms decreased and became less intense.  Her skin used to be dry & have little bumps on it and it gradually became soft and smooth. *** As her life became easier and happier her health improved. ***  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEmotions have a huge effect on health. Instead of focusing energy on controlling and bringing balance it is more effective to focus on bringing joy, acceptance and laughter.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443923164,"authorName":"Cass Kotrba","from":"Cass Kotrba &lt;caskot@...&gt;","profile":"cass.kotrba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Another food question","postDate":"1460052920","msgId":76954,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDQwMS1FQVM0ODA3MjY4QjdCRkE0Q0MzQjA3NDFDMUM0OTAwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDZGMzM4OUM3LUEyNTItNEI4MC04OTY2LUIzREU2OTM3RUQwOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":76952,"nextInTopic":76955,"prevInTime":76953,"nextInTime":76955,"topicId":76934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-- People who can listen to things they don’t want to listen to….

People come here to discuss how unschooling can be affected, or can affect, the situations they bring, so please don’t treat this discussion as though the questions are “What in all the earth should I be considering?”  They can go elsewhere in all the earth to look for those ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, the topic should be what can be done normally, in terms of learning and relationships, acceptance, assistance, a positive and peaceful environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mom hasn’t had bread around, that might be another thing a six year old would eat.  Anytime a parent’s special diet is applied to a young child, that can be a problem.  Children NEED sweet foods to grow.  If he would like anything in the form of nutella, peanut butter, jam, on bread and that has NOT been an option, the mother is unnaturally limting his options, and his learning, and perhaps his health.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis brought this do a discussion years ago.  The title the editors put on says “might,” but the details in the article are not “might be.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological\">http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is more, on my site<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sugar\">http://sandradodd.com/sugar</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor any parent reading here who thinks children are harmed by sugar, or that most people are harmed by gluten, there is a condition parents are succumbing to lately, in the hundreds of thousands of people, or millions.  It’s a disorder like anorexia, or bulimia, but it can affect the whole family directly—it can cause divorces, and cause the children not to trust the parents (for good reason):  orthorexia.  It is the belief (false) that there are foods that will immediately do severe damage, and that even touching them can harm you, and that IF someone can control the (imagined) purity of foods they ingest, that they will have near-magical results)—intelligence, creativity, long life.   The belief is contagious, especially to people who are fearful or gullible.  It harms unschooling, because it’s illogical and extreme and ends up involving shame and control (if it hasn’t already started there).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent focusses on food as dangerous, dirty, alarming, deadly—that can be passed on to children, even vaguely, in the mood of the kitchen.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.orthorexia.com/what-is-orthorexia/\">http://www.orthorexia.com/what-is-orthorexia/</a><br/>\nIf you don’t like that page, google orthorexia and read about it, if you don’t already know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":486569116,"authorName":"","from":"cheri.tilford@...","profile":"boobearcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Another food question","postDate":"1460042696","msgId":76947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5lNXUyZCsxN2N1NGUwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzQzAxNzIxLTdCRUYtNEZDNS05QkIzLUM1MDg1Q0U5RTE0NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3UG9kdkgtYnVWeXVIa2ZOdGtzNGNjYVNnbmJTekZXdWU4V1B1anpfNHIwZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENEMDJFOUZFLTc2NTEtNEI2Ri1CQkYzLUJGNjI2NjhERDM4OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDc4QThDRDU0LTgxNjctNEFCRC1CNkZFLUZFRjYyOTQ4Q0E4OUB5YWhvby5jb20+CTwxM0MwMTcyMS03QkVGLTRGQzUtOUJCMy1DNTA4NUNFOUUxNDRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76946,"nextInTopic":76948,"prevInTime":76946,"nextInTime":76948,"topicId":76934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... my daughter visited a cranial sacral/physical therapist once for a spinal adjustment (it was an attempt to fix an eye turn, which didn t work, but we","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1888460150\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;<span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">digestive systems aren’t finished developing when they’re born and it can take a few years&lt;&lt;</span><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br> </span></div></span></blockquote><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">my daughter visited a cranial sacral/physical therapist once for a spinal adjustment (it was an attempt to fix an eye turn, which didn&#39;t work, but we learned a ton about proper alignment) and this woman was a veritable fount of knowledge about the interconnectedness of all bodily systems, and how they&#39;re all tied to the spine and the nerves coming out of the central nervous system.&nbsp;</span></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">even a minor misalignment can cause pain and malfunction, as nerves and muscles are tweaked off-balance and pulled the wrong way. there are lots of parts to the digestive system, and a teensy bit of pulling on a nerve in any part will disrupt smooth functioning. not to mention the digestive system in a perfectly healthy person may not be fully developed until age 6 or 7.</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">questions I was asked to ascertain if there could be an alignment issue:&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">how fast was the birth? quick passage through the birth canal can squish the skull bones out of alignment, affecting the whole spine, and therefore everything else. this can be fixed by a cranial sacral therapist.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">has there ever been a fall on the head or butt (tail bone)? ever tumbled down the stairs or fallen off a playground? ever been in a car accident? bike accident? anything that gives the body a good jostling can knock things out of whack.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">not sure what the alternative medical community is like in your area, but it might be worth seeking out a practitioner who treats the WHOLE person, not just specific parts at a time. cranial sacral therapy and acupuncture/acupressure come to mind for me.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">cheers,</font></div><div><font color=\"#3f3f3f\">cheri</font></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235225792,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"dogsheeptiger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Another food question","postDate":"1460037520","msgId":76946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMTYwNDA3MDY1ODQwLjk2MzljY2M1MzgyOTgwZDk2ZmI1NmU2NGZiZDU1YzM3LmI0NjlkYTVmNjUud2JlQGVtYWlsMDYuc2VjdXJlc2VydmVyLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":76944,"nextInTopic":76947,"prevInTime":76945,"nextInTime":76947,"topicId":76934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter, now 9.5, has a very limited palate.

I didn&#39;t eat much at all. My Mum says she chased me around putting chocolate in my mouth, and chocolate was one of the few things I ate. I was very small and skinny, and\n the doctor sent me to a medical place&nbsp;called a Sun Ray Centre in the 1970&#39;s (apparently really a bad thing, they&#39;ve since found out!) - it was supposed to be for &#39;delicate children&#39; and make you gain weight (it didn&#39;t work!).<br>\n<br>\nI can&#39;t remember why I didn&#39;t like most foods. I don&#39;t remember it being a texture thing, or having any kind of pain or anything. I just didn&#39;t like the taste, as far as I recall. Over the years I just started eating more things though. Probably by the time\n I was a teenager I was eating pretty much what other kids were eating, although I always ate way more chocolate than other kids until I was in my 20&#39;s.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn&#39;t rule out something medical, as Bernadette said, but it *could* also just be a limited taste thing. I don&#39;t really remember being exhausted, even though I didn&#39;t eat a lot - so maybe that is something different to look in to?&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIdeas -&nbsp;Are there specific textures he tends to like more?

I didn&#39;t eat much at all. My Mum says she chased me around putting chocolate in my mouth, and chocolate was one of the few things I ate. I was very small and skinny, and\n the doctor sent me to a medical place&nbsp;called a Sun Ray Centre in the 1970&#39;s (apparently really a bad thing, they&#39;ve since found out!) - it was supposed to be for &#39;delicate children&#39; and make you gain weight (it didn&#39;t work!).<br>\n<br>\nI can&#39;t remember why I didn&#39;t like most foods. I don&#39;t remember it being a texture thing, or having any kind of pain or anything. I just didn&#39;t like the taste, as far as I recall. Over the years I just started eating more things though. Probably by the time\n I was a teenager I was eating pretty much what other kids were eating, although I always ate way more chocolate than other kids until I was in my 20&#39;s.<br>\n<br>\nI wouldn&#39;t rule out something medical, as Bernadette said, but it *could* also just be a limited taste thing. I don&#39;t really remember being exhausted, even though I didn&#39;t eat a lot - so maybe that is something different to look in to?&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIdeas -&nbsp;Are there specific textures he tends to like more? Soft things? Or crunchy?&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nOr is it that he just really prefers sweet things? Will he drink smoothies with ice cream and sweet fruits like berries in them, and a bit of honey?
