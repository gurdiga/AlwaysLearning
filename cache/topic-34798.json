You know, as I sit here trying to focus my words and type them, I<br/>\nthink it is manipulative.   It may not be an intentional manipulation, but<br/>\nit is manipulation.   If my child does something that I percieve as &#39;wrong&#39;,<br/>\nthe only effect I can see from that is guilt.  By me saying, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry<br/>\nI&#39;ve set a bad example.
