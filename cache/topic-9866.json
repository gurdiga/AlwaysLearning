The last time was in July, 1985, so breaking it<br/>\nagain October 11th 2002 isn&#39;t TOO frequent, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it is too frequent because it inconveniences a lot of people and puts<br/>\nmuch of our everyday lives at a standstill.  Keith was saintly the first<br/>\ntime<br/>\nand we didnâ€™t have any children yet.  This time the kids will get much of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nworkload, with Keith still being saintly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big inconvenience this time was I was in South Carolina to speak at a<br/>\nhomeschooling conference, and I was on my way to the opening remarks and<br/>\nintro, after which I was doing a keynote speech.  I had a talk and a<br/>\nworkshop<br/>\nscheduled for Saturday, a workshop for Sunday and the farewell address.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween the second floors of the two buildings in the hotel was a ramp.  Too<br/>\nsteep, too slippery, some kind of indoor/outdoor carpet on it, and I went<br/>\ndown.  This wasn&#39;t the foot I sprained a month ago, but the other one, the<br/>\nleft one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was not far behind me, several people were on the little patio at the<br/>\nend of the ramp. Paramedics came.  Nice women, smart, friendly, but they had<br/>\na gurney that only cranked down to about 18&quot; off the ground.  I was afraid<br/>\nto<br/>\nstand up on the lately-sprained left foot, ON that ramp, still slippery, so<br/>\nthey got firemen to put me on the gurney.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first ambulance ride!  One of the homeschooling moms, Kathryn, went with<br/>\nme.  They took me  to a VERY near hospital, a mile or less up the road,<br/>\nPalmetto Baptist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent several hours in a little closed room in the emergency area, hoping<br/>\nI<br/>\ncould have surgery that evening.  It seemed possible, but didn&#39;t happen.<br/>\nX-rays showed breaks just above the ankle on both bones.  (Not nearly as bad<br/>\nas the 1985 breaks.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not happy thatI was going to miss the first alternative homeschooling<br/>\nconference in the southeastern U.S., and I felt horrible for letting people<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSurgery was noon Saturday and I hoped that I could leave the next afternoon<br/>\nin a wheelchair to at least do the closing speech, or that maybe the hotel<br/>\ncould bring conference people in a bus to some big room at the hospital or<br/>\nSOMETHING, but on Sunday I was sick from post-op this&#39;n&#39;that, and throwing<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a dozen visitors, all of whom assured me that although I was missed,<br/>\nthe conference was wonderful and people were meeting others and learning a<br/>\nton.  That was good to hear, but also sad because I wasn&#39;t getting to meet<br/>\neveryone, and the morphine drip was keeping me from being equally alert at<br/>\nall times.  I was zoning out, but it was keeping the pain down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty sat in on the panel discussion in my place, and seemed really happy<br/>\nabout having done so.  He made a good impression on lots of people there.  I<br/>\nheard reports about how good he was at helping the younger kids with games,<br/>\nthat he seemed more mature than they expected of a thirteen year old, and<br/>\nthat he was handling the stress very well.  I was grateful to people for<br/>\nbringing him to see me in the hospital, and we talked on the phone some too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this accident , the hotel will make concessions for next year&#39;s<br/>\nconference, I hope, and the room Marty and I had, he stayed in free for four<br/>\nnights.   Anne Ohman was right next door to Marty and Joyce Fetteroll past<br/>\nthat.  Mary Gold was down a couple of floors.  They all helped Marty out on<br/>\nthe weekend, and Anne and Joyce had video-game-playing kids with them, and<br/>\nso<br/>\nthere was some good interaction about that, some sight-seeing, some trips to<br/>\ngood kid-food places (since they had a van).    So IF they fix that ramp and<br/>\nare as  helpful to Kelly Lovejoy, our hostess and organizer, as they need to<br/>\nbe, we&#39;ll try again next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, thank you for ALL your help, and the ride to the airport.  Even<br/>\nthough<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t &quot;a good weekend&quot; for me, I had a great time being with you and<br/>\nyour<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe flew home as scheduled, with me being carried up the steps in a special<br/>\nchair to the Canadair jet, and down (flight to Cincinnatti) and then helped<br/>\ninto a first class seat on the 737 for the rest of the flight home.  My foot<br/>\ndidn&#39;t hurt as much as I had been afraid it would, I didn&#39;t get woozy, and I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to try to use an airplane bathroom, so my fears were happily<br/>\n<br/>\nunmet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the four flat levels of the house, I&#39;ve been stationed in the den so I<br/>\ncan<br/>\nget to &quot;the cat bathroom&quot; and the office, but the first night home I was in<br/>\nmy OWN bed, next to Keith, and that was good.  It was dark and quiet and the<br/>\nmattress and pillow weren&#39;t plastic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably end up deleting some of the yahoogroups mail because it&#39;s<br/>\nquite<br/>\npiled up.  It might take me a bit to get through all the personal mail too,<br/>\nbut I figured one report on this to everyone would keep me from having to<br/>\nretell it (because it hurts my leg and my feelings every time I tell it) and<br/>\nit will give people a heads up on why I might be flakey or a no-show in the<br/>\nnext few weeks.  (Kathy, we need to reschedule that lunch; Helena, I can&#39;t<br/>\ndo<br/>\na Jasmine pick-up or delivery as I should have; Jeff and Mike, music<br/>\npractice<br/>\nwill need to be here or not at all for a while, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo weight on it for six weeks is what they told me in South Carolina.  I<br/>\nguess maybe that means after six weeks I can get a walking cast, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow.  I guess I&#39;ll see a Lovelace ortho-guy next week to see x-rays and get<br/>\na preview of my coming weeks.  They put pins in one bone and a plate and<br/>\npins<br/>\nin the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m safe at home and will try not to bring down the<br/>\nhappiness of those around me.  I can only sit up a while at a time now.  I<br/>\nhave a wheelchair and a walker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen some of the photos of me are available, I&#39;ll put them on a website so<br/>\nyou can see me downed on the ground, and in the hospital if you want more of<br/>\nthe full effect.   I&#39;ve been to South Carolina twice now, and been in the<br/>\nhospital both times (well, the first time my parents were living in Aiken<br/>\nand<br/>\nwent across the border to Augusta, Georgia, for my birth, so maybe that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t count).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really sorry for the inconveniences this will cause in the coming weeks.<br/>\nI have movies to watch and books to read and kids to hang out with, and I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to sit at the computer longer as time goes on, so I&#39;m not lonely in<br/>\na<br/>\nquiet home alone at all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll o&#39;ya&#39;ll be careful walking on wet ramps.  (Add that to your list of<br/>\nthings to watch out for.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n10/17/02<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
