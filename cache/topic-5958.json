The interesting thing is that my parents were not <br/>\nreally controlling at all around food or eating, and did not have <br/>\nserious body issues of their own.  It happened that everyone in my <br/>\nfamily is quite thin naturally (even underweight, by insurance <br/>\ncharts), so no one was telling me that I was &quot;fat.&quot;  But everyone in <br/>\nmy family decided together to go on Weight Watchers when I was about <br/>\n15 (none of us had more than 5 pounds to lose, I don&#39;t think).  This <br/>\ndiet started really by coincidence only a few months before a <br/>\nparental &quot;crackdown&quot; that included surveillance (reading my diary, <br/>\ncalling me at friends&#39; houses to verify that I was really there, <br/>\nchecking with friends&#39; parents about what I was doing), which lead to <br/>\nthe destruction of my trust in them, and then a series of groundings. <br/>\nDuring this time my parents still did not try to control my food or <br/>\neating, but it really was one of the few things I felt _I_ could <br/>\ncontrol, and so I did, and did so compulsively, which lead to bulimia <br/>\nwhich lasted for about 4 years.  I &quot;cured&quot; myself by following the <br/>\nadvice of Geneen Roth, who has written a number of books in which she <br/>\nadvocates eliminating restrictions on your eating and really just <br/>\ntrusting yourself and your appetites.

Speaking for myself,<br/>\nI felt bombarded by images of &quot;beauty&quot; and didn&#39;t know any women in my life<br/>\nwho were happy with the way they looked.  I also heard, &quot;She&#39;s so thin&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Aren&#39;t you pretty&quot; so often when I was little that I thought it was<br/>\nsupposed to be part of who I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my first daughter was born, I decided I would have to pretend to be<br/>\ncomfortable in my own skin.  By the time my second daughter was born four<br/>\nyears later, I wasn&#39;t pretending any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also very conscious of the things people say to and around our<br/>\ndaughters, and of what they are seeing in the media - and we talk to them<br/>\nabout it.  Many times it appears kids aren&#39;t listening when they are.  We<br/>\njust assume they hear everything.  So, for example, when the mothers at the<br/>\npool are complaining to each other and saying no way will they get in a<br/>\nbathing suit, we talk on the ride home about how bodies don&#39;t only change at<br/>\npuberty, but throughout life, and it&#39;s sad that some people don&#39;t enjoy the<br/>\nchanges that time and childbearing bring.  More importantly, I&#39;m not sitting<br/>\non the side of the pool in my clothes.  I am IN the pool playing with my<br/>\nkids - not thinking about what I look like, so they know I believe what I am<br/>\nsaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it is not always very complex.  The easiest way to create a<br/>\nbulimic is to control what they eat from the time they are children.<br/>\nTrusting your child to know when she is hungry, how much and what to eat is<br/>\na pretty good way to ensure that food is not going to become an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some signs you can look for:  moving food around on the plate, not<br/>\nletting the fork touch the lips or tongue, looking to the parent while<br/>\nfilling the plate to get invisible approval over the choices, sneaking food,<br/>\nwithdrawn behavior, and speaking very quietly were some signs that no one<br/>\nsaw in me, but there are many others as well.  There have been some good<br/>\nbooks written by anorexic/bulimics - none of which I can think of right now<br/>\n:0).<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: homeschoolmd [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschoolmd@...\">homeschoolmd@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 01, 2002 10:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Something I learned....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find out any more about these girls and possibly some of the<br/>\ncauses for their problems, would you please let us know.

Myself and several women friends<br/>\nattended a women&#39;s spiritual workshop on our bodies, weight, the connections<br/>\nbetween all of them.  The workshop was very enlightened and it was great to<br/>\nmeet all these women working on themselves...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does this have to do with unschooling you might ask... One of the<br/>\nlast exercises that we did was where the facilitator (a Dr) showed us how<br/>\npeople can continue a cycle that is hard to break when it comes to<br/>\nunderstanding our bodies.  She drew 2 pictures the first picture she drew<br/>\nwas a stick person holding out a book with a stern look on their face (this<br/>\nperson was labeled The Perpetrator).  To the left of this large person was a<br/>\nsmall stick person (this person was labeled The Victim) and the 3rd stick<br/>\nperson was next to the Victim, but larger than the victim and called the<br/>\nRebel.... She explained that it is a cycle..... The next picture was of a<br/>\nmother or father or loving person holding a smaller stick person on their<br/>\nlap and lovingly showing the person the book....<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was telling us that with our bodies we perpetrate ourselves, then we<br/>\nbecome victims, and then we rebel... The other picture is about having<br/>\nsomebody loving (ourselves) take care of ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow instead of me seeing this as representing the food thing I was there<br/>\nfor... It was crystal clear that she was talking about school....  The<br/>\nteacher was the perpetrator, who is a stranger, the child was the victim who<br/>\nthen rebels and acts out.... Alternatively at home learning the loving<br/>\nperson is holding the child and teaching them rather than scolding and<br/>\nshamming them....<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this was a very interesting analogy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5974,"nextTopicId":5965}}
