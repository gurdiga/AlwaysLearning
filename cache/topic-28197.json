There would be no cost, but we ask that you <br/>\ntake care of our 3 dogs (Lab, smaller mutt, Shih Tzu) and our 3 cats <br/>\nand one Ball python. You could use one of our cars if you didn&#39;t bring <br/>\nyour own.<br/>\nWe live on 5 acres in Benson, AZ, which is town of 5000, about 45 <br/>\nminutes form Tucson. Our house has 3 bedrooms (master, dd 9, ds 13), <br/>\nDSL, XBox, Gamecube, NO television (other then many, many foreign <br/>\nchannels). We own some movies though and have two video stores in town <br/>\nfor rentals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking for these dates: Saturday, April 14 through Saturday, <br/>\nApril 28. And Wednesday, June 20 through Tuesday, July 10.<br/>\nArrival could be on earlier date, departure on later, but not the other <br/>\nway around. Naturally we do not expect one family to come for both <br/>\ndates...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested, please contact me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arbinsy@...\">arbinsy@...</a>. Feel free <br/>\nto pass on this mail to any local lists you may be on. We do prefer a <br/>\nhome- or unschooling family, but if you know of someone else perfect, <br/>\nthat would be good too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nSybelle<br/>\ndh Arnold<br/>\ndd Bibiana (9)<br/>\nds Ingo (13)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28195,"nextTopicId":28160}}
