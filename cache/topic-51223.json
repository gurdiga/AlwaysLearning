Don&#39;t assume what these would be, and don&#39;t do more than the law absolutely requires.<br/>\n <br/>\nIF you want to unschool:<br/>\n <br/>\nI think having any kind of journal *requirement* is a barrier both to deschooling and unschooling in the long run.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think she is not experiencing her freedom while she is having to account to you for the learning value of her activities.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think you won&#39;t be able to see natural learning working fully while you are insisting on keeping the learning schoolish.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wonder why you are keeping this big reservation - &quot;have to put her back in school&quot; - in your mind. If there is some reason that you will &quot;have to&quot; put her back in school, it might be worth revealing. <br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t try to dissect what she is learning, and don&#39;t continue to ask her to do so. Just give her time to genuinely deschool, and then help her do what she wants to *do*. The learning happens automatically. <br/>\n <br/>\nSupport her computer time with practical help - bring snacks, check her comfort - instead of evaluating it. <br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about merely minimizing the painful. It is about living a wonderful life today.<br/>\n <br/>\nRobyn L.
