Regularity <br/>\npromotes friendships. My friend who started a now thriving park day did it <br/>\nby relentlessly turning up at the park at the same time every week rain or <br/>\nshine, winter or summer, regardless of who else or how many others promised <br/>\nto be there. Now the whole big group goes to dinner after every long park <br/>\nday. It took close to two years, and she did not rely only on an online <br/>\npresence to network.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that if there weren&#39;t enough opportunities local to me, I would be <br/>\ntravelling. I do in fact - Jayn has friends who live 30 miles away in two <br/>\ndirections. My favorite park day is 25 miles away (not that I do that every <br/>\nweek, but I would have if there had not been 5 other local opportunities). <br/>\nNow Jayn&#39;s dance class and the park day following are the anchor of our <br/>\nweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you being rigid about your son&#39;s nap time? Could he sleep in the car <br/>\nseat or on a blanket at the park if he is too big for a sling?

He still walks up to perfect strangers and is very<br/>\ncomfortable starting conversations... of the 5 year old variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has noticed many times that people aren&#39;t interested.  And been<br/>\ndisappointed about it.  He&#39;s even dealt with kids who were in school and<br/>\nthough they are now homeschoolers, they actually were unfriendly and harsh<br/>\nat times, partly I suspect because they&#39;re very much of the school age<br/>\nsegregation mindset, as well as Karl is simply at different developmental<br/>\nstages than they are, and the things Karl wants to do are not the things<br/>\nthey want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was hard for him sometimes.  He asked me about it at one point and I<br/>\nmentioned that sometimes in order to get along with others, it helps to just<br/>\njoin what they&#39;re doing rather than to try to convince others of his play<br/>\nidea... that anything different --no matter how *good* the idea is--<br/>\ninterrupts what they&#39;re already busy with.  He figured out more about that<br/>\nas he continued getting together with others, and he seems to have fun<br/>\njoining without having an agenda sometimes.  He&#39;s figured out more about<br/>\nwhen to introduce a new play idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve enjoyed watching him changing tactics and interacting with others.<br/>\nBecause he was sometimes struggling pretty hard, I made it a point to stick<br/>\nclose and help with distractions if the kids got in each other&#39;s hair.  It&#39;s<br/>\na lot of fun and I learn things *I* don&#39;t know.  :)  I was always very shy<br/>\nin school, and it&#39;s interesting watching someone who is much more outgoing<br/>\nup close.  Karl is different and watching how others develop social skills<br/>\nis totally fascinating to me.  I know some things about people that a 5 year<br/>\nold doesn&#39;t have the experience to know yet, and I&#39;m also learning a lot.

Not only will she find other children of a wide <br/>\nrange of ages that will play group games all together, you won&#39;t have anyone <br/>\nsuggesting that she should be put in school for social reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt these homeschool groups you will find individual friends for her for <br/>\nplaydates, including possibly some slightly older girls who could be willing <br/>\nto come over sometimes and play with her, and you will learn about other <br/>\nsocial and learning events. For example the dance class that my daughter has <br/>\nmade the center of her life since she was three was originally found through <br/>\nmy local homeschool park day group. Other moms continue to organize events, <br/>\noutings, and train trips to other towns.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn now 9 currently plays most often with a five year old, the two year old <br/>\nacross the courtyard, our neighbors who are almost six and just eight, two <br/>\nsisters who are eight and ten, and another family who are two, five, nine <br/>\nand twelve. All of these children are homeschooled except for the two year <br/>\nold.

Some kids just love crafting more than others, and timing is <br/>\nalso everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe artistry of children is a subject very close to my heart. I tend to feel <br/>\ndubious about kit crafts that seem like adult initiated pointless busy work, <br/>\nas compared to making something that the kids want to make or have for <br/>\nreasons of their own. Children need real quality art supplies and useful to <br/>\nthem materials (which can include felt or cardboard boxes or styrofoam <br/>\npackaging or duct tape) for free exploration and to be supported in forming <br/>\ntheir own goals and project plans. I find that Jayn comes and goes with her <br/>\nmanufacturing activities - but she always comes back to them because she is <br/>\nmaking things that are important to *her*. At the moment she is making  bead <br/>\nand gold wire earrings to sell online and at craft fairs, and helping me <br/>\ndevelop projects and ideas for my latest couple of writing projects about <br/>\ncrafting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion is to start doing some stuff in the yard like starting a <br/>\nvegie or flower garden, or a mud patch, together that might welcome some of <br/>\nthe other neighborhood kids in to play and join in.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am trying to help her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; develop her inner resources so that she can learn to have fun by herself. <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whatever her temperament is, and it may be that she is extrovert and highly <br/>\nsocial, unschooling allows you to honor and celebrate it, instead of trying <br/>\nto change it. Unschooling is about living in the real world, not isolating <br/>\nfrom it - at least not all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was this age &quot;fun by herself&quot; consisted of fantasy doll play and <br/>\nwater exploration on a ladder by the sink for relatively brief periods like <br/>\n40 minutes within my hearing. The vast majority of her time was spent <br/>\ninteracting with me. Even when playing with friends, she wanted me nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers usually put their relationships with their children as their <br/>\nfirst priority. Does your dd want to be by herself more? It seems not from <br/>\nwhat you have reported. Or is it really that you want to occupy herself and <br/>\nso you can get other stuff accomplished? The time our children really want <br/>\nfrom us can be so much more than we could have imagined before they came in <br/>\nto our lives. I am constantly in awe of the level of time and energy, both <br/>\nemotional and physical, that unschooling parents are willing to invest in <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s happiness and activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;they need their<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parents the most to help guide them and teach them new things.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you have read a more about unschooling, you will learn that these are <br/>\ntwo very different actions.
