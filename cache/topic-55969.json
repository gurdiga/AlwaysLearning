I thought its basis was the same as the title of this forum &quot;Always Learning&quot;. Rather than have a child sit in a traditional classroom for 8 hours and listen to a teacher tell him what to learn, I thought Unschooling was learning in every day life with real word applications. I thought I would be able to use this forum to learn tips from experienced parents on unconventional, practical, real-world learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nApparently the idea of having a short list of very simple rules that everyone in the house follows is too much for the Unschooling way of thinking. Simple things, like putting a toy away after you&#39;re done playing, sharing meals together at a table, and always striving to be polite and kind, are not values Unschoolers teach. At least, I&#39;m not supposed to teach them. I&#39;m supposed to let my child guide himself, and wait and hope that he&#39;ll catch on, eventually, rather than gently explaining why we do what we do, and reminding him when needed. Apparently I must watch what I say, too, because the idea of redefining a negative word into a positive word is not recommended. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow silly of me to think I could learn about all these things from a forum without having every comment I make be judged to be wrong. Very ironic, considering what I now know of the Unschooling movement. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you all for your time, and will take up no more of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMel<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;organicmom111&quot; &lt;cksah@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  **He loves going outside, but we must pick up our toys inside before going<br/>\n&gt; outside.

Then he noticed some of his clothes sitting stacked on the floor, picked them up, and said &quot;Mommy put away, please!&quot; then ran to his room, turned around, said &quot;Coming?&quot; and proceeded to open his closet and ask for help putting things in their proper places. He then went and got his daddy&#39;s clothes.

My dd asked them if they wanted to make a big brunch (scrambled eggs, ham, toast and coffee).  They made extra for others too!  When they were done I asked if they could please rinse their dishes and stick them in the dishwasher and I&#39;d get the pans and clean up the rest.  They agreed.  I happily finished the clean up and was very appreciative that they made such a delicious brunch that fed not only them, but me and at least two of my other kids!  The initiative was all theirs even though I&#39;d have done it for them.  <br/>\n:)  Laurie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear some stories of kids helping out without chores.

This morning Rosie said she had an <br/>\nextra hour and did I want to get started on putting it together. She&#39;s <br/>\n19 and she knows she&#39;s good at putting things together. We worked in the <br/>\nhot sun for an hour and she said, &quot;We got most of the hard steps done, <br/>\nmom, so we can probably get it finished tomorrow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband invited people over to watch the World Cup Final on Sunday. <br/>\nHe forgot to tell me until late Saturday night. Sunday morning we got up <br/>\nand all three of us scrambled around cleaning the house up. We didn&#39;t <br/>\nask Rosie to help, she just jumped up and helped because it seemed the <br/>\nright thing to do at the moment. (Roxana is in Indiana at a leadership <br/>\nworkshop for sorority and fraternity kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do most of the dishwasher loading (but not all - if the dirty dishes <br/>\nsit a while, somebody else will almost always get to them), but when <br/>\nthere are clean dishes in the dishwasher, Rosie or Roxana will almost <br/>\nalways notice and unload it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie and Roxana (19 and 22) do all their own laundry. Sometimes I offer <br/>\nto move it to the dryer or something - but they just completely took <br/>\ncharge of their own laundry years ago. One of them will do a load of <br/>\ntowels if they notice we&#39;re short of clean ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are all things they do without being asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask, too. Like if we&#39;re going to be driving somewhere with a bunch of <br/>\npeople in my minivan, I&#39;ll ask them to go make sure it is empty and <br/>\ncleaned up enough, because I drive around with a lot of stuff stored in <br/>\nmy car, much of the time. They just do it and don&#39;t think anything much <br/>\nabout such a request. Once in a while I ask one of them to dust or <br/>\nvacuum or sweep or something like that. I don&#39;t ask much - my standards <br/>\nare low - but when I ask, they usually get to it sometime within the <br/>\nnext few hours. Sometimes the living areas of the house get cluttered <br/>\nenough to bother me and I&#39;ll ask them to go through and find their own <br/>\nstuff and put it away.  This should go under the things they do without <br/>\nbeing asked, too, though --- occasionally they&#39;ll notice the coffee <br/>\ntable or dining table is piled up and they&#39;ll sort through it and clear <br/>\nit off without being asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey totally keep their own rooms clean - I don&#39;t really even think <br/>\nabout that anymore. They let them get to be a big mess sometimes - but <br/>\nthen they dig in and spend a few hours reorganizing and cleaning and <br/>\nthey usually call me in to admire their work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur trash truck comes on Thursdays. My husband takes the big trash cans <br/>\nout, but Rosie usually runs around the house and dumps the trash from <br/>\nall the little trash cans into one big trash bag. I think my husband <br/>\nusually asks her to do that - but it is something she does cheerfully <br/>\nand regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t probably feel satisfied with the amount of housework my kids <br/>\nwould do if I never asked - but there&#39;s asking versus <br/>\ndemanding/commanding. I ask. They can say no. Often I just say out loud <br/>\nwhat I think needs to get done before we go somewhere - they take that <br/>\nas me saying they should help with it. For example, I might say, &quot;I <br/>\nreally want to get the garden watered and unload the dishwasher before <br/>\nwe leave.&quot; Immediately one will say, &quot;I&#39;ll unload the dishwasher,&quot; and <br/>\nthe other will say, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll water.&quot; Very very common occurrence.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya is 25 and lives in her own house with her fiance and a roommate and <br/>\nshe&#39;s a good housekeeper.

We lived in an older house, and I wasn t sure the pipes didn t contain","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-190860871\">Years ago, a friend saw I was buying those 2.5 gallon containers of water to drink. We lived in an older house, and I wasn&#39;t sure the pipes didn&#39;t contain lead, plus I grew up with well water, and &quot;city water&quot; has never tasted right to me - I can always taste the chlorine. So, I bought water. She knew we were on a tight budget, and gave us a refillable water dispenser, with a filter, that we could keep in our fridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was when we were unschooling, and I would have even said radically unschooling, but I didn&#39;t really understand what that meant. I didn&#39;t coerce the boys... unless I really *needed* to. (ahem) I coerced them very kindly. (blush) After going to our first conference, I made a HUGE shift in how I related to them - seeing all those radical unschoolers together, how the parents related to their kids, seeing the mostly-grown unschoolers - it made everything CLICK, and I GOT it. I won&#39;t go into all the details of that shift, I&#39;m guessing lots reading have been through it, plus it doesn&#39;t have to do with this post, really, except as background to where we were.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the water filter. I was *always* the one to fill the filter. Always. I&#39;d find it empty, and fill it. Usually grumping under my breath, or sighing. Or even saying nasty things like, &quot;Oh, you want water? Well, the filter&#39;s empty. I wish someone had filled it earlier, when they took the last of the water.&quot; (Oh, my cheeks are red right now! It&#39;s embarrassing, looking at how I acted!) After &quot;THE SHIFT&quot; and after reading a LOT on lists, I began to see how manipulative that was, and how MEAN. I started to fill the filter, every evening, really feeling the love for my boys as I did that. Setting the stage for an easier next day, when they&#39;d go to get water, and the filter would be full of clean cold water, no grumping included.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could use the filter as a way to gauge my mood! If I was feeling a little put-out about filling it, I knew PMS might be on the way, or that I needed to make sure I found the time to nurture myself a little bit. If that was going on, I would make sure to breathe, and find the peaceful loving place inside as I filled the filter. Not perfectly - but I NEVER grumped out loud about it again, or sighed. I knew my irritation was my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of how I&#39;d parented before - the &quot;nice&quot; coercion - for some time, I rarely asked the boys to help with house stuff. I knew they needed to heal from my bad choices, and I felt I needed to step away, take things on myself, to show them the shift was real. While I moved into asking them for help with other things, the water filter was one thing I did myself, every evening (or more often if we needed it). It&#39;s an invisible thing I did, to practice loving generosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for about the past year, when I&#39;ve gone to fill the filter, I find it&#39;s already full, well over half the time. I don&#39;t see who fills it - I&#39;m guessing my oldest, but I don&#39;t know for sure, it could be my youngest, or both of them. It represents so much - being full of love, full of generous caring. It&#39;s always been symbolic for me - I think of my friend nearly every time I use it, who noticed & cared for us so sweetly when we needed that, and I think of how much I&#39;ve grown as a mom, and now I think of how much we care for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be perfectly, finely, fulfilled-ly happy if I was still the only one who filled the filter. This has been an unexpected surprise, a tangible way of seeing the results of shifting into a truly radically unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: kids helping out","postDate":"1279059785","msgId":55994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDRjRCNkU4LTQzRTQtNDE2NC04MkY4LTY4RjAxRDAwREQyMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxaWZ1YytucXZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxaWZ1YytucXZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55981,"nextInTopic":56001,"prevInTime":55993,"nextInTime":55995,"topicId":55969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Happy birthday Kristi!
