She will be 9 in April.  I taught public school for 9 <br/>\nyears before I had her, grades 1-3 during that time period.  I tried <br/>\nto teach reading using the whole language approach, but was pretty <br/>\nmuch forced to teach the phonics approach because that was the <br/>\ncurriculum we had to use, plus the dreaded Iowa tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I decided to homeschool my daughter, of course I took <br/>\nthe &quot;school&quot; approach (I had not heard of unschooling until this past <br/>\nfall).  I think I am a big reason for why she is not reading.  I <br/>\ntried everything on that poor child.  She just wasn&#39;t ready to read, <br/>\nbut I kept forcing her (that was the &quot;teacher devil&quot; in me - as John <br/>\nHolt said).  Boy, I tried quite a few programs to no avail.  I even <br/>\nthought maybe she had dyslexia and even went to a dyslexia <br/>\nconference.  It didn&#39;t seem to really fit, although she has a few of <br/>\nthe symptoms which probably most kids do at one point or another. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me sad that I didn&#39;t just stop and really look at her and <br/>\nsee the frustration, sadness, anger, and humiliation she was <br/>\nexperiencing.  I just kept plugging away saying school teacherish <br/>\nthings like &quot;You know that word.  You&#39;re just not trying&quot; and &quot;what <br/>\nsound does that letter make?&quot;  &quot;Come on!  Just sound it out.&quot;  Of <br/>\ncourse, most of the time I was frustrated as well and I know beyond a <br/>\nshadow of a doubt she knew it just based on the tone of my voice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I began reading about unschooling and reading your website, John <br/>\nHolt&#39;s books and every other thing I could get my hands on, I guess I <br/>\nsaw the light.  I backed off completely.  No more workbooks. No more <br/>\nforcing her to read aloud to me.  No more turning everything into a <br/>\nreading lesson.  She is s-l-o-w-l-y starting to chose to read a few <br/>\nvery easy books on her own.  I guess in a way, she is having to <br/>\ndeschool as far as reading goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe amazing thing is that she is so confident with math.  I never <br/>\nreally did a lot of math instruction with her because I was so intent <br/>\non her learning to read at a young age.  She has no fear of math and <br/>\nis always coming up to me with the newest thing she learned, math <br/>\nwise.  One day, she made a discovery all on her own that anytime you <br/>\ndouble a number, whether that number is odd or even, the answer is <br/>\nalways even.  She decided one day to learn her doubles and she did.  <br/>\nI noticed a few months back that she would stop in front of the <br/>\nanalog clock and stare at it for a long time, run off and play, then <br/>\nreturn to stare some more.  By the end of the week, she had pretty <br/>\nmuch figured out how to tell time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think because I love to read, I want her to &quot;hurry up&quot; and read <br/>\nbecause I just &quot;know&quot; that she will enjoy it as well.  I am having to <br/>\nreally step back and let her come to reading on her own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 5.  You can bet that I have not made the same mistake.  He <br/>\nis not interested in reading right now, not even really interested in <br/>\nletters.  I am reading to both children lots and lots, we go to the <br/>\nlibrary several times a week, they dictate stories to me that I type, <br/>\nand they &quot;write&quot; letters and cards (my 8 year old still just makes <br/>\nscribbles and won&#39;t attempt to try to write words unless she <br/>\nabsolutely knows how) to relatives and friends that we actually send <br/>\n(I remember as a teacher I&#39;d have the kids &quot;write&quot; letters or cards <br/>\nto book characters that never got mailed - what an idiotic thing to <br/>\ndo!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess if I were to continue on the path of forcing my daughter to <br/>\nread and using all sorts of programs to entice her and bribe her <br/>\n(such as &quot;Book It&quot; etc.), she would end up being one of the illerate <br/>\npeople that we hear so much about.  I am hoping that it is not too <br/>\nlate and that some day, she will decide to read and will want to read <br/>\nfor the enjoyment of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for reading this long post!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;Sandra@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- So...we can all agree that<br/>\n&gt; a child who is not at school and is surrounded by words, is<br/>\n&gt; supported by others who can read and not shamed...will read!
