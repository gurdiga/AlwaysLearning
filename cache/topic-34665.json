What is it?<br/>\nWell, of course, everyone knows that it is a day to honor mothers.  To show<br/>\nthem how much you appreciate them, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I need/want one day every year to celebrate being a mother? One day<br/>\nto know that i am appreciated by those whom I care for? ONE DAY? You have to<br/>\nbe kidding me. I started rethinking that. I don&#39;t want ONE day. I want to<br/>\nknow I am appreciated every day. I don&#39;t need a diamond ring or a piece of<br/>\npaper that tells me that. I need to look at my family in a different way. I<br/>\nneed to see the ways that they tell me they love me EVERY SINGLE DAY!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I started yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first &quot;Mother&#39;s Day&quot; was marked by the fact that my two beautiful, very<br/>\nsocial daughters who are unschooled (and since we haven&#39;t had a car in<br/>\nseveral weeks we haven&#39;t been able to make it to local meetings)  turned<br/>\ndown playing with the local schooled neighborhood kids (whom they have been<br/>\nplaying with every day for the last 2+ weeks, might I add so they aren&#39;t not<br/>\ngetting *any* social interaction right now) to make slime with their mom.<br/>\nWhat a compliment to hear them tell the kids to go home because they are<br/>\ndoing a project with mom. It warmed my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see the results of our science project at<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com/2008/05/slime.html\">http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com/2008/05/slime.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after thinking about all this, I had to look up Mother&#39;s Day on<br/>\nwikipedia and got to learn the history of Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#39;s_Day\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#39;s_Day</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some interesting information on it...<br/>\n<br/>\n At first, it was to honor the Gods in Roman and Greek times. Here&#39;s how it<br/>\ncame about in the US.<br/>\n<br/>\n*The United States celebrates Mother&#39;s Day on the second Sunday in May. In<br/>\nthe United States &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States</a>&gt;, Mother&#39;s Day<br/>\nwas loosely inspired by the British day and was imported by social<br/>\nactivist Julia<br/>\nWard Howe &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe</a>&gt; after the American<br/>\nCivil War &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War</a>&gt;. However, it was<br/>\nintended as a call to unite women against war. In 1870, she wrote the Mother&#39;s<br/>\nDay Proclamation<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_Proclamation\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_Proclamation</a>&gt;as a call<br/>\nfor peace and disarmament. Howe failed in her attempt to get<br/>\nformal recognition of a Mother&#39;s Day for Peace. Her idea was influenced by Ann<br/>\nJarvis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Jarvis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Jarvis</a>&gt;, a young Appalachian<br/>\nhomemaker who, starting in 1858, had attempted to improve sanitation through<br/>\nwhat she called Mothers&#39; Work Days. She organized women throughout the Civil<br/>\nWar to work for better sanitary conditions for both sides, and in 1868 she<br/>\nbegan work to reconcile Union and Confederate neighbors.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*When Jarvis died in 1907, her daughter, named Anna<br/>\nJarvis&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Jarvis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Jarvis</a>&gt;,<br/>\nstarted the crusade to found a memorial day for women. The first such<br/>\nMother&#39;s Day was celebrated in Grafton, West<br/>\nVirginia&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton%2C_West_Virginia\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton%2C_West_Virginia</a>&gt;,<br/>\non 10 May &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10</a>&gt;<br/>\n1908&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908</a>&gt;,<br/>\nin the church where the elder Ann Jarvis had taught Sunday School.<br/>\nOriginally the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church, this building is now the<br/>\nInternational Mother&#39;s Day Shrine (a National Historic<br/>\nLandmark&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark</a>&gt;).<br/>\nFrom there, the custom caught on � spreading eventually to 45 states. The<br/>\nholiday was declared officially by some states beginning in 1912. In 1914<br/>\nPresident Woodrow Wilson<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson</a>&gt;declared the first<br/>\nnational Mother&#39;s Day, as a day for American citizens to<br/>\nshow the flag in honor of those mothers whose sons had died in war.*<br/>\n<br/>\n*Nine years after the first official Mother&#39;s Day, commercialization of the<br/>\nU.S. holiday became so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a major<br/>\nopponent of what the holiday had become. Mother&#39;s Day continues to this day<br/>\nto be one of the most commercially successful U.S. occasions. According to<br/>\nthe National Restaurant<br/>\nAssociation&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Restaurant_Association\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Restaurant_Association</a>&gt;,<br/>\nMother&#39;s Day is now the most popular day of the year to dine out at a<br/>\nrestaurant in the United States.*<br/>\n<br/>\n So much for that idea, lol!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com\">http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;Working Toward Pro&quot; Photographs<br/>\nwww.hopescreations.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com\">http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34672,"nextTopicId":34660}}
