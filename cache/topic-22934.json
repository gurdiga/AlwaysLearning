It&#39;s called Play and Learn and was easy to find.   Ooops.   Sorry <br/>\nabout quoting the whole thing then.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuly 29, 2005 article on the banning of Grand Theft Auto in Australia:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html\">http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The game cannot now be legally sold, hired, advertised or exhibited in <br/>\nAustralia.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Businesses that sell or hire computer games should remove existing stocks <br/>\nof this game from their shelves immediately,&quot; said OFLC director Des Clark.&quot;<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if it would be illegal for someone (private person, not a dealer) to <br/>\nsell a copy he had legally purchased in Australia to another Australian?   <br/>\nAnd I wonder what the price could climb to if it&#39;s legal or what the fine would <br/>\nbe if it were ruled illegal?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is really pretty extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so now there&#39;s an article (as of today) saying actual carjackings were <br/>\ndown by HALF since that game came out.   Funny, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nStatistics, though...<br/>\nStill, if statistics were used to condemn the game, statistics should be fair <br/>\nfor redeeming it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22933,"nextTopicId":22937}}
