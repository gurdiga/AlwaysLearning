I read quickly and can give him synopses of books he can&#39;t/won&#39;t find time to read, so he asks questions while/after I&#39;ve read them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s a partnership we have been growing into for 10 years. All too aware that no one person can know everything, we seek information form others who know what we are wondering about. In the process, we show our kids how to find out stuff they want to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I have done to reassure him (not necessarily to convince or persuade), to help him see how lovely our learning lives are becoming without the burdens of structure, is to share with him as often as possible what the kids say and do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, yesterday I took them to Sea World (we live nearby and have passes). Since it is between spring break season and schools-out season, the parks are pretty empty, making it much less hectic to visit. We first visited the sea lions. They were making a delightful racket. Britton, who is five, looked up and me and smiled, &quot;Mommy, it sounds like they are trying to make a band.&quot; I listened more closely. Sure enough, not only were the sounds loud, they had differing qualities and were clearly connected to each other. I hugged him for helping me to hear music in their barks. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, on the way home (with the video playing Fantasia 2000 :) ), I looked back at Chloe. She was getting that sleepy-eyed look that 3-year-olds get when they are tuckered out. She smiled at me and said quietly, but with satisfaction, &quot;I had a good day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI called Wilton and told him about getting splashed by Shamu (Alexandra, our 8-year-old, was less than thrilled about this, but the rest of us had great fun wondering when that frigid water would get us) and all of our other adventures. This little bit of paying attention and sharing with him, in the kids&#39; words, what happened has been helpful for him. I&#39;ve noticed that he also looks for ways that the kids express how they are responding to an event or activity and then he shares it with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, to connect to my change of subject line, I think we all have special roles to play -- not dictated by biology or society, but dependent upon the needs of ourselves, our partners, and our children. Sometimes Chloe desperately wants to be the &quot;leader,&quot; so we must be followers. Sometimes husbands/spouses/partners who love us and their children just need/want to know how to see and hear evidence that all is well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6328,"nextTopicId":6279}}
