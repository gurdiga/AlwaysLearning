I&#39;m brand new to unschooling, and am still at the stage where I spend a lot of time questioning if I&#39;m just taking the easy way out.  Last night I got a call from my best friend who was shaking--I could hear it in her voice--with frustration over her daughter&#39;s schoolwork.  The daughter &quot;wasn&#39;t trying,&quot; &quot;is just acting dumb so she doesn&#39;t have to do her homework,&quot; and other expressions of anger.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  And honestly, when my daughter was in school I&#39;d often feel the same way, even knowing how smart she is, and curious about the world!  I&#39;d have to leave the room at homework time because I&#39;d get so angry.  Especially around testing time, when my daughter had to do all this review of stuff that was just to satisfy the No Child Left Behind laws, I would dread the end of the school day because for me the stress was just starting, but for my daughter it was just a continuation of the stress she was always under.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  And listening to my friend&#39;s anger and frustration I felt so grateful that we don&#39;t have to go through that anymore.  But this is the same friend who--bless her heart, I love her but I disagree with her--thinks that unschooling is just a cop-out, because how am I going to know my daughter is learning anything if I don&#39;t have her tested, tested, tested.  And other well-meaning friends who act like they&#39;ve never heard of such a thing as organic learning, letting my daughter&#39;s fine, curious mind take her in its most natural course to embrace the whole world.  They might not say it, but I hear in their voices the doubt, that maybe I&#39;m just being lazy, &quot;dropping out&quot; myself by allowing my daughter to &quot;drop out.&quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So it&#39;s kind of hard for me to hear that there really are parents who use homeschooling as an excuse to do nothing.  I want to naturally rebel against such a thought because I&#39;m afraid that maybe I&#39;m kidding myself.  It is easier to unschool, when you compare it to the constant stress and frustration of homework and testing and evaluations and parent/teacher conferences.  It is easier when you don&#39;t have to dress your kids in 20 layers of clothing on a frigid winter morning just so they can trudge outside before the sun&#39;s even fully up to catch the school bus.  It&#39;s easier being able to get up when your body&#39;s rested instead of when the alarm tells you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It&#39;s a lot easier to have a day that&#39;s structured around the body and the mind&#39;s natural rhythms than some arbitrary schedule.  So does being grateful for that mean that I&#39;m just naturally lazy, that I don&#39;t want to make the effort?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mary<br/>\n                        <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Drop outs vs homeschooling","postDate":"1192561981","msgId":31051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJGRDg2RDBDLUFBQjgtNDFGMC1BNzRFLUNDMjQ2QjNEOUMxMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmMm4yditudHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZmMm4yditudHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31050,"nextInTopic":31052,"prevInTime":31050,"nextInTime":31052,"topicId":31037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I guess I just don t know anyone who blows the unschooling horn but is uninvolved with their kids, so I find it difficult to imagine just what you mean.-=- ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-234846514\">-=-I guess I just don&#39;t know anyone who blows the unschooling horn but<br/>\nis uninvolved with their kids, so I find it difficult to imagine just<br/>\nwhat you mean.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGood!

We&#39;ve been getting firewood for winter since <br/>\nJuly, (during those times we could get into the woods)and we were <br/>\nbusy for a few days painting our kitchen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a good time together, we talk and joke.  While we were <br/>\npainting we listened to cassette tapes Dylan made when he was four <br/>\nand five.  He was a reporter covering Godzilla&#39;s attack on Tokyo.  We <br/>\nlaughed until we had tears squirting out our eyeballs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut generally things have been lully.<br/>\n<br/>\nA coworker of David&#39;s was injured.  He&#39;ll recover but David knows him <br/>\nwell and knows the guy who squished him and saw the accident and was <br/>\ntraumatized by it some.  Then, on his way home from work after a <br/>\ntwelve hour night shift he got smacked on the highway when a passing <br/>\ncar spun into his lane.  He wasn&#39;t injured but was stiff and sore for <br/>\na few days.  He&#39;s bummed about his car.  It was a free car, and it&#39;s <br/>\nold, but it was reliable and got thirty five miles to the gallon so, <br/>\nwas a good commuter for a guy who drives a hundred fifty miles to <br/>\nwork, one way.  David hasn&#39;t been especially exciting at home the <br/>\nlast two weeks. &lt;g&gt;  Then, our good friend, Mungus, my brothers dog, <br/>\nhad a big seizure and died.  Mungus was our Frisbee buddy this last <br/>\nyear since my brothers work schedule changed and we volunteered to <br/>\nwalk him.  He was a big goofy Lab.  The world seems duller without <br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Dylan and I went out for a day of fun Wednesday.  We went to the <br/>\nbig city, (Missoula&lt;g&gt;)  browsed the book stores, visited the comic <br/>\nbook store, looked at new video cameras, had breakfast and lunch and <br/>\ndinner out.  It was lovely. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd Friday Dylan&#39;s cousin called to invite him to her family cabin <br/>\nfor a last lake adventure.   I wasn&#39;t feeling brave enough to get <br/>\ninto a kayak in that cold water but the young folks did and they got <br/>\nwet (but recovered quickly) and had a great time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two things planned this week with Dylan, an outing in another <br/>\ntown and a rock climbing day in Refrigerator Canyon, if the weather <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t turn ugly.  Then we get company next week for three days.  <br/>\nI&#39;m back in the mode of looking for fun things to do now though - <br/>\ninstead of just trying to get stuff done. &lt;g&gt;   I think it would be <br/>\neasy to let a busy life outpace the fun.  This last week I&#39;ve been <br/>\nrewired for fun,and boy howdy I needed it. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Drop outs vs homeschooling","postDate":"1192420535","msgId":31046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxQzUwMjQ5LTNBNzUtNEQ0MC05RjE0LUU5Q0YwNUVEMzNCM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZldWxwaCs5YzUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZldWxwaCs5YzUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31044,"nextInTopic":31048,"prevInTime":31045,"nextInTime":31047,"topicId":31037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I do have something against people who make a lot of pretty noise ...
