Would you recognise the symptoms? TSS is an extremely rare<br/>\nbut potentially serious illness that can affect anyone. This website gives<br/>\nyou the essential facts about TSS, helping you to understand what TSS is and<br/>\nhow it is caused. Bookmark this site for easy reference in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a type of blood poisoning that will make you<br/>\nfeel severely ill very quickly.<br/>\nTSS is a rare but potentially serious illness that can develop quickly in<br/>\nanyone ­ men, women and children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTSS is caused by the common bacteria ­ Staphylococcus aureus ­ which<br/>\nnormally live harmlessly on the skin and in the nose, armpit, groin or<br/>\nvagina of one in every three people. In rare cases certain strains of these<br/>\nbacteria can produce toxins (poisons) that cause TSS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     TSS is extremely rare and most doctors will never even see a case.<br/>\nThere are probably around 40 cases of TSS per year in the UK.<br/>\nIn extreme cases it may prove fatal and sadly out of the small number of<br/>\npeople who fall ill each year, 2-3 die from TSS1.<br/>\n1Source: Public Health Laboratory Service, UK<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can get TSS ­ men, women and children. Half the reported cases of TSS<br/>\nare associated with women using tampons; half result from localised<br/>\ninfections, for example following burns, boils, insect bites or surgery. The<br/>\nrisk of TSS is greater in younger people. This is because older people are<br/>\nmore likely to have the necessary antibodies to protect them from the toxin<br/>\nthat causes TSS. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the symptoms of TSS are much like severe flu¹<br/>\nand usually include some or all of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\na sudden high fever (temperature)<br/>\nvomiting<br/>\na sunburn-like rash<br/>\ndiarrhoea<br/>\nfainting or feeling faint<br/>\nmuscle aches<br/>\ndizziness<br/>\nconfusion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     Consult your doctor at once, if you or anyone you know, has some of<br/>\nthese symptoms and suspect TSS. If you are wearing a tampon remove it and<br/>\ntell your doctor that you have been using tampons. Don¹t worry about being<br/>\nalarmist ­ it is important to rule out the possibility of having TSS and if<br/>\nnecessary your doctor will then be able to begin treatment early.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith early diagnosis TSS can be treated with antibiotics to kill the<br/>\nStaphylococcus aureus bacteria, and other medicines which help counteract<br/>\nthe symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe link between TSS and tampon use is unclear. Research suggests that for<br/>\ncases which occur in women using tampons, tampon absorbency is a factor. For<br/>\nthis reason it is important that you:<br/>\n<br/>\nalways use a tampon with the lowest absorbancy suitable for your period flow<br/>\n<br/>\nuse a sanitary towel or panty liner from time to time during your period<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInformation about TSS is contained in the tampon manufacturers¹ instruction<br/>\nleaflet. This information is often updated, so remember to read the leaflet<br/>\nregularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen using tampons, it is also important to remember to:<br/>\n<br/>\nwash your hands before and after inserting a tampon<br/>\nchange tampons regularly, as often as directed on<br/>\nthe pack<br/>\nnever insert more than one tampon at a time<br/>\nwhen using at night, insert a fresh tampon before going to bed and remove it<br/>\non waking<br/>\nremove a tampon at the end of a period<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToxic shock syndrome is a rare illness. From a UK population of around 58<br/>\nmillion there are about 40 cases reported each year, half of which are<br/>\nassociated with women using tampons1.<br/>\n<br/>\nMen, women and children can get toxic shock syndrome, for example following<br/>\nburns, boils, insect bites or infections after surgery. About half of the<br/>\nreported cases are linked to women who use tampons; the other half are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith early diagnosis toxic shock syndrome can be successfully treated.<br/>\nSadly, however, out of the small number of people who fall ill each year,<br/>\n2-3 people die from TSS1. It is important to remember that if TSS is<br/>\ndiagnosed and treated early there is a good chance of recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost doctors will never see a case of toxic shock syndrome. TSS is so rare<br/>\nthat most doctors will not come across TSS during their medical careers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1Source: Public Health Laboratory Service, UK<br/>\n====<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160951630,"authorName":"pmteet","from":"&quot;pmteet&quot; &lt;pmteet@...&gt;","profile":"pmteet","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: menstruation products","postDate":"1074574274","msgId":18183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1aWM0MisybWUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTIwMDI0NDAwLjUxNTkxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18158,"nextInTopic":18188,"prevInTime":18182,"nextInTime":18184,"topicId":18131,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"- Ok I have a question about this.
