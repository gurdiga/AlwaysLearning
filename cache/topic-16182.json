I am just jumping in here. My name is Nancy, I used to belong to <br/>\nthis group, but quit almost all my online activities earlier this year because <br/>\nmy dh was having medical problems and we were in some dire straits <br/>\nfinancially. Things are better now! Anyway, for those of you who don&#39;t know me, or don&#39;t <br/>\nremember me, I have been at home with my kids for years now. We have always <br/>\nunschooled, never used curriculums. Moly&#39;s kindergarten year reminded me why I <br/>\nhated school so much and we decided we couldn&#39;t do any worse. So far no one has <br/>\ncomplained, and in our house that is something! So as long as that continues <br/>\nwe will too. :o) <br/>\n<br/>\nMoly is 9 and Jack is 7. Darin and I have been married over ten years now. <br/>\nMoly wants to be either a doctor or a veterinarian, but mostly a vet. Most of <br/>\nher activities revolve around animals. She collects food and other things for <br/>\nStone Nature Center, she reads books upon books about all sorts of animals, and <br/>\nshe is trying to find a vet who will let her volunteer in his office. Jack <br/>\nwants to be a movie star and I think if anyone can be a star, he can! It&#39;s like <br/>\nliving with Robin Williams, Andy Kaufman, and Jim Carey in one person. He says <br/>\nwhen he becomes a star, he is going to buy me a house in Malibu and a tank. <br/>\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to drive a tank Mom? It would be lots of fun to crush stuff!&quot; <br/>\nThat&#39;s my boy! &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16181,"nextTopicId":16189}}
