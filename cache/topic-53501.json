Besides being loving and kind, they were heavily &quot;involved&quot; in their kids lives. When this issued came up, my sister listed all the things the did &quot;for&quot; their son: attended his basket ball games, took him and his sisters to Hawaii and Europe (on more than one occasion), took him waterskiing every summer, lived in the country in a big house with an indoor pool, gave him music lessons, spent time talking with him at the end of the day (1:1 at bedtime). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this was all stuff that they gave but never checked in about. I&#39;m sure my nephew was glad for all of the above &quot;perks&quot;. But it wasn&#39;t enough. Or it wasn&#39;t the right stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted to be &quot;seen&quot;. He didn&#39;t want to live on the surface of their relationship. He wanted his parents to know him, really know him, and respond accordingly. When they didn&#39;t, he felt angry, and my sister avoids strong feelings like the plague.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect this is part of the reason I dislike the term &quot;Quality Time&quot;. Who is defining what quality is in that relationship? My sister thought they were offering it according to her idea of what quality is. Her son, on the other hand, never felt it was quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was born, I asked  him what he would have wanted to happen differently in his childhood. He said, I wanted them to sit down and play a game with me - a game I wanted to play. I wanted them to know that I love hiking and to choose to go hiking with me. I wanted them to talk with me about what I wanted for my life, not what they wanted me to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll small things that would have probably made a huge difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"Bun","from":"&quot;Bun&quot; &lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Quality Time Vs.

It&#39;s not quality time if everyone is angry about having to be there.  Authentic quality time would be when the family wants to eat dinner together because they enjoy the company and the conversations that might go along with that. If I decide that Friday night is family movie or game night and make everyone participate, it&#39;s not good, quality time if someone doesn&#39;t want to be there doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom used to make me go boating with her. She thought it was a great activity for the family to do together. I was deathly afraid of being on a tiny Sunfish or tipsy canoe in the middle of a lake but that didn&#39;t matter. We were doing something as a family. My fears were silly. Then she would get angry that I did everything I could to make the experience miserable for everyone. She would also take me skiing even though I hated cold weather and was miserable. I&#39;m always colder than she is. She&#39;d blow me off. Tell me I was being ridiculous. I didn&#39;t like being there with my toes frozen. It was quality time to her, though, because we were all there as a family. She never once did anything with me that I wanted to do because she didn&#39;t think the things I liked had any worth. So although we did a lot of things together as a family I wouldn&#39;t consider any of them quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree that quantity does not necessarily equal quality. It&#39;s better to spend the 15 minutes you have after dinner and homework and before bedtime doing something enjoyable with your kids than spending all day in the same house ignoring them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Quality Time Vs.

As Pam wrote, &quot;She decided what he needed/wanted and decided when to include him in some activity that she came up with for him.&quot; This is the type of parenting that &quot;Quality Time&quot; has inspired. This is not the same thing as a parent who works and still makes her kids her priority when she&#39;s not at work. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s often the byproduct of full-to-bursting lifestyles that are all about reaching some sort of status quo goal, whether that&#39;s producing über children or having the nicest house on the block or... <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Authentic&quot; can also mean genuine or real. It&#39;s not necessarily a measure of &quot;goodness&quot; but certainly is a measure of whether or not something is really what it says it is. I realize it&#39;s an often misused term, appropriated for flaky type things, and that some people are allergic to it &lt;g&gt;; however, that&#39;s not how I meant to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam has a good point. Quantity can never replace attentive, mindful parenting... even for home learning families. And *most* parents, who are willing to spend time with their children and make them a priority in their lives, are also willing to have solid chunks of time of &quot;good quality&quot; that are more substantive than the adult-oriented bread crumbs usually alloted through fleeting moments of &quot;Quality Time&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Quality Time Vs.

The first is curling parenting (Scandinavia... curling, as in the winter sport, where every obstacle is swept out of a child&#39;s way). And the other one is &quot;Lawnmower Parents&quot; for parents who continue to intervene for their kids when they are young adults (often used by those folks at post-secondary institutions).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there are parents who go overboard and try to live their children&#39;s lives for them (or it appears that way) for whatever reason (like parents who have their children&#39;s whole academic and career futures mapped out for them at the age of 5, maybe); however, it also seems to me that society is quite ready to label even healthily supportive parents with negative terms, simply because they give their children a high priority in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom-in-law, who I actually like, told me, when my son was just a babe-in-arms, that there was no &quot;s&quot; at the beginning of &quot;mother&quot;.

I always thought it was to make working parents feel better about being away from their kids for 10 hours a day. That was all ok if you spent 15 minutes reading a book at bedtime. Quality time at dinner was a big thing. There are still commercials about how teenagers who eat dinner with their families regularly are less likely to use drugs.
