After a  <br/>\nwhile, instead of telling stories of what they&#39;ve heard other people  <br/>\ndid, they have stories of what their own kids have done, learned,  <br/>\nseen, known.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one kind of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people start unschooling and they&#39;re doing more chattering  <br/>\nthan looking, and more asserting than questioning (not chattery  <br/>\nquestioning, but soul questioning).  It&#39;s not as good a beginning,  <br/>\nand at some point they do start really observing their children, and  <br/>\nreally thinking about the why and what of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut any time a mom thinks there&#39;s nothing to know, I don&#39;t think she  <br/>\nknows nearly enough.<br/>\nWhen a mom thinks unschooling is doing nothing, she&#39;s not doing  <br/>\nnearly enough.<br/>\nIf a mom thinks unschooling will take none of her time, she needs to  <br/>\nspend a LOT of her time (more than those who knew it would be a life  <br/>\nchange) figuring out how to spend timebe with her child and what she  <br/>\ncan do, even when her child&#39;s not there, to help unschooling work  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cringe when I hear/read/see a mom thinking unschooling will take  <br/>\nless effort and cost less than having children in public school.    <br/>\nAnyone unschooling to save time and money is going the wrong  <br/>\ndirection.  It might cost less in absolutely-required expenditure  <br/>\ncompared to buying a curriculum or paying private school tuition, and  <br/>\nmost unschoolers I know are content with plain or used or funky  <br/>\nclothes (compared to school uniforms or required fashions and name  <br/>\nbrand things that might get stolen or lost at school).  But if  <br/>\nparents don&#39;t want to spend ANY money on games, toys, museums, out-of- <br/>\ntown trips, books, whatever it is the kids might be interested in,  <br/>\nthen I think that&#39;s not the best the parents could do as unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a basis, a foundation, on which confident, workable  <br/>\nunschooling is built, and most of it involves confidence, and  <br/>\nconfidence can&#39;t come without examination of one&#39;s purpose,  <br/>\npriorities and principles.  It takes a while to figure those things  <br/>\nout, and while they can be figured out at the same time unschooling  <br/>\nis unfolding, and will probably continue to evolve  (maybe even after  <br/>\nthe kids are grown), it&#39;s not &quot;nothing&quot; to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone was asking how many hours she should spend with her  <br/>\nchild, or something, and  I said at least as many hours as she  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been in school, counting transportation, and there seemed to  <br/>\nbe some shock and surprise in the audience.  So that made me want to  <br/>\nsay (I didn&#39;t, but should&#39;ve) TWICE as much time as she would&#39;ve  <br/>\nspent in school.   Because honestly, a child shouldn&#39;t lose the mom- <br/>\ntime she would&#39;ve had at night and on weekends, should she?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shock probably came from someone who thought those hours would be  <br/>\nteacher-style hours, of being stuck in one place doing something not  <br/>\ntoo fun.  That vision can only come from someone who hasn&#39;t looked  <br/>\ninto unschooling enough to know that the best unschooling hours  are  <br/>\nfun, natural, real activities.   They needed to learn more about  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New to the group and home education","postDate":"1156495801","msgId":26859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5MEUyODA5LTE2NjQtNEU0Mi04MDJELTVDM0EwN0FFOTVDQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzMTZEREU5LUQwM0ItNEIwMy04Q0NELTQxOTIyNDc5Mjg3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwODI0MTY1MjEzLjU4MTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU3MTExLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQ0RURFQTA0LjIwOTAzMDBAYnRvcGVud29ybGQuY29tPiA8ODMxNkRERTktRDAzQi00QjAzLThDQ0QtNDE5MjI0NzkyODc0QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26857,"nextInTopic":26860,"prevInTime":26858,"nextInTime":26860,"topicId":26845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooling, although a subset of <br/>\nhomeschooling, is not schooling at home; it is not testing your child to <br/>\nfind out where she is so that you can address her areas of academic <br/>\nweakness. Unschooling is about exploring the world with your child.

Education happens as a side effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Just as people plant vegetable gardens to raise vegetables.<br/>\n            Along the way pollinators come and it&#39;s even a vital part of<br/>\n            the process, but the purpose of planting the garden isn&#39;t to<br/>\n            attract pollinators.<br/>\n<br/>\n            The purpose of the other homeschooling methods is to give to<br/>\n            the child something that appeals to the parents. In a way<br/>\n            formal educational methods are like those cool educational<br/>\n            toys that parents want to give their kids for their<br/>\n            birthday. What you&#39;re buying with a curriculum is an image<br/>\n            of what you want your child to be. The image may be as<br/>\n            simple as being prepared to be whatever they want to be. And<br/>\n            yet it is still like picturing your child playing with the<br/>\n            super deluxe Erector set you&#39;re planning to give them. But<br/>\n            what if the child has no interest in Erector sets? What if<br/>\n            what the child really wants is a Nintendo system?<br/>\n<br/>\n            I think many parents see education as a gift they can give<br/>\n            their children. But what if the recipient doesn&#39;t want the<br/>\n            gift? If the purpose of giving a gift is to satisfy some<br/>\n            need in the giver for the recipient to have the gift, is it<br/>\n            really a gift? If the gift giver has emotional stake in the<br/>\n            recipient appreciating the gift and the effort involved in<br/>\n            providing the gift, is it really a gift?<br/>\n<br/>\n            I think it would be helpful for parents choosing formal<br/>\n            education to see it honestly. Despite the pictures of happy<br/>\n            children using the various formal curriculums, it&#39;s not<br/>\n            about giving a gift. It&#39;s about meeting parents&#39; needs. It&#39;s<br/>\n            about molding and shaping a fellow human being against their<br/>\n            will into something we want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n            That sounds harsh, but if it weren&#39;t against their will,<br/>\n            then the children would choose to do it on their own. If it<br/>\n            weren&#39;t against their will, there would never be instances<br/>\n            where the parent is coercing the child to do something for<br/>\n            the curriculum that the child doesn&#39;t want to do. There<br/>\n            would never be instances where the child can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\n            want to finish that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n            Unschooling is about giving them the freedom to be who they<br/>\n            are. Formal education is about molding them into something<br/>\n            we think is valuable to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you decide to unschool you should really and truly examine why <br/>\nyou want to homeschool. If it is to achieve some educational goal, to <br/>\nachieve some level at college entrance exams, for example, while <br/>\nunschooling is as viable a method as any other for attaining that, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t as focused as that. If it is because you believe that school <br/>\nitself will drain the imagination and joy out of all things learning, <br/>\nthan you may want to rethink whether or not school at home won&#39;t do the <br/>\nsame damage. If you set yourself up as an antagonist in your <br/>\nrelationship with your daughter it will always be hard for you.

But trying to memorize information out of context is very hard.  <br/>\nFortunately they aren&#39;t the same! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a (not so) quick ;-) example. My daughter and I have been  <br/>\nlistening to a Japanese language learning tape. It&#39;s pretty similar  <br/>\nto learning in school: memorization, repetition without real  <br/>\nunderstanding. The hope is that understanding will come with  <br/>\nrepetition. The very first lesson introduces the words for  <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; (watashi) and &quot;understand&quot; (wakari). We&#39;re up to the 3rd lesson  <br/>\nand I *still* get the words confused. Anyone learning that language  <br/>\nnaturally (as your daughter learned English) wouldn&#39;t make that  <br/>\nmistake. In natural conversation I/watashi and understand/wakari  <br/>\nwould pick up the feelings of the contexts they are heard in. We also  <br/>\nlearned the phrases for &quot;Good morning&quot; and &quot;Good afternoon&quot;. They&#39;re  <br/>\nboth learned in the same context: hearing the sounds from a tape in  <br/>\nthe car so the only difference is the sounds of the words and you  <br/>\nhave to force your mind to think morning when you hear &quot;ohayo&quot; and  <br/>\nafternoon when you hear &quot;konnichiwa&quot;. BUT if you&#39;re learning language  <br/>\nnaturally, they won&#39;t be heard in the same context and someone won&#39;t  <br/>\nhave the problem of confusion (or not for long). Hearing it used in  <br/>\nJapan for real naturally you&#39;ll get a *feeling* of &quot;morning&quot; with  <br/>\n&quot;ohayo&quot; because you&#39;ll only hear it in the morning, doing morning  <br/>\nthings. And &quot;konnichiwa&quot; will take on a feeling of afternoon for the  <br/>\nsame reason. (My daughter and I have an advantage of having hosted a  <br/>\nfew Japanese school girls and &quot;ohayo&quot; has absorbed mornings of the  <br/>\ngirls being dropped off for camp and all greeting each other with  <br/>\n&quot;Ohayo!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting to easy, though, takes a huge shift in how you see learning  <br/>\nand how you see your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a good list for beginners:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe AlwaysLearning list tends to be for unschoolers who&#39;ve been doing  <br/>\nit for a while and more about life than the details of how to make  <br/>\nunschooling work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com\">http://sandradodd.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand the message boards at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278843354,"authorName":"hsingmygirls","from":"&quot;hsingmygirls&quot; &lt;hsingmygirls@...&gt;","profile":"hsingmygirls","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New to the group and home education","postDate":"1156391718","msgId":26845,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjajd2Nis3Y3U4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26846,"prevInTime":26844,"nextInTime":26846,"topicId":26845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, group.
