I am trying to<br/>\nfigure out how to explain what we are doing to my friend, A, who has<br/>\n&quot;concerns&quot; about my 10 year old daughter, Karen.  I&#39;ve known A since she was<br/>\n8 months pregnant with C.  We attended the same LLL group and became LLL<br/>\nLeaders together.  Karen considers C to be her best friend from birth.  Her<br/>\ndaughter has been in school all along, first Montessori preschool (where her<br/>\nmom worried that she wasn&#39;t reading like some of the other 4-year-olds),<br/>\nthen on to all-day kindergarten at a private school.  Karen has been<br/>\nhomeschooled the whole time, with attempts at a version of school-at-home<br/>\nwith K and 1st grade, transitioning into unschooling by the time she was 7<br/>\nand I gave birth to my 3rd daughter.  We attend the same small neighborhood<br/>\nchurch where A is one of the Sunday school teachers.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I was picking up my daughter from a slumber party with C.  My<br/>\nfriend, A, hosted 3 kids, plus her own, and took them to church in the<br/>\nmorning.  We chatted as I gathered up Karen&#39;s things and A says she has a<br/>\nquestion about homeschooling.  We had a short conversation that went like<br/>\nthis:  <br/>\n<br/>\nA: &quot;Do you ever have Karen evaluated?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: You mean do I test her?  <br/>\n<br/>\nA: Yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: No, I don&#39;t test her.<br/>\n<br/>\nA:  Oh, because I have some concerns<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe conversation stopped there because the kids were in and out of the room.<br/>\nThe other mom was also there picking up her kids and I did not want to have<br/>\nthis conversation with the other mom there also. This other mom has asked me<br/>\nseveral times how I know how Karen is doing if I don&#39;t test her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure I know what the concerns are.  My daughter does not read as<br/>\nfast as her daughter and cannot answer &quot;pop quiz&quot; type math questions. I<br/>\nrecently learned that my friend has &quot;quizzed&quot; Karen at past playdates at<br/>\ntheir house.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago in Sunday school, when A was the teacher, Karen was asked to<br/>\nread part of a peace prayer out loud.  (This is a small church, by the way,<br/>\nand this particular Sunday, there were only 3 kids in Sunday school.)<br/>\nKaren&#39;s friend, C, is saying, oh I&#39;ll read it!  This is fine with Karen, as<br/>\nshe&#39;d rather not read.  But A (C&#39;s mom) says, no let&#39;s give Karen a turn.<br/>\nWell, Karen gets stuck on the first word (almighty) and a few more after<br/>\nthat.  Her friend would supply the word quietly and really fast before Karen<br/>\ncould figure it out herself.  Karen says that this really bugged and<br/>\nembarrassed her, and that she almost had a few of them figured out when C<br/>\nsaid the word for her.  At some point, A quietly said C&#39;s name and she<br/>\nstopped supplying the words.  Then it was C&#39;s turn to read, and Karen says<br/>\nshe reads really fast, &quot;like you mom.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Karen told me about it, she showed me her copy of the prayer and the<br/>\nwords she got stuck on.  We went over the whole thing; she likes the prayer.<br/>\nShe explained that she just had not seen some of the words before and did<br/>\nnot recognize them.  I asked Karen, &quot;How do you feel about your reading?&quot;  I<br/>\nwas wondering, since she said she was embarrassed, that maybe she thinks she<br/>\nshould be reading better.  A couple of years ago, she used to state that<br/>\nso-and-so could read better because they went to school.   Her answer, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nfine with it!  I don&#39;t care how long it takes me to read faster.  I just<br/>\nwant to be able to read in my own time [meaning her own pace] and without<br/>\nsomeone telling me all the words.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been avoiding a big conversation with my friend.  When we were newer<br/>\nunschoolers, I was still figuring it out myself and did not feel confident<br/>\nexplaining it to others.  Especially to someone who believes so strongly in<br/>\ntraditional education.   Now I am more confident in our choices, but still I<br/>\nhesitate to get into a debate.  Not that I &quot;have to&quot; debate with her, but I<br/>\nfeel like the whole things needs to be addressed if we are going to continue<br/>\nto support the friendship between the girls.  I&#39;d like for her to understand<br/>\nthat I am not neglecting my daughter&#39;s education, and to just drop the<br/>\n&quot;evaluations&quot;.  I don&#39;t hope to convince her that this is a better way.  My<br/>\nhusband is worried that she would become so &quot;concerned&quot; that she would<br/>\ncontact social services or something, thinking she was doing the right<br/>\nthing.  I don&#39;t think that is likely, but still, the thought is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate any input anyone might have.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJenny Canfield <br/>\n<br/>\nin So Cal<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Karen, 10.5; Linda 6.5; and Melissa, 3.5.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31040,"nextTopicId":30952}}
