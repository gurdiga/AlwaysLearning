I&#39;m discouraged that people don&#39;t think about the <br/>\nfurther ramifications of that kind of thinking. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understood the argument made here, though, about the law eventually <br/>\nchanging to make homeschooling all as accountable as those enrolled directly <br/>\nwith the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs usual, I&#39;m coming from a place of concern about methodology and learning <br/>\ntheory while others are being more politically minded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really hate to use my child as a political pawn one way or another.  <br/>\nFor some people, though, they think of government first (how to bring it <br/>\ndown, how to abide by it, how to hide from it, or whatever) and non-political <br/>\nrealities later.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I speak at conferences, I run through my notes before to try to make <br/>\nsure what I&#39;m saying will be as true anywhere, regardless of state law.  And <br/>\nwhen people ask me about state law, I tell them they need to ask the locals.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling works the way it works because of the way people work.  It works, <br/>\nif allowed to work, because of the relationships between people, and because <br/>\nit uses people&#39;s natural proclivities, working with human nature instead of <br/>\nagainst it.  It works, when it works, without regard to the physical point on <br/>\nearth of the family practicing that philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if a family&#39;s in a state that requires annual testing, that&#39;s <br/>\nunfortunate, and they might not be able to relax into unschooling, or just <br/>\nmight have to be eclectic if they intend to fulfill all state laws.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t volunteered to tweak families&#39; lives to match a certain state or <br/>\ncountry&#39;s laws.  I&#39;ve volunteered to help people see how kids learn naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo politics are out of my chosen and accepted arena.  I learn what I know <br/>\nabout it  peripherally, and with resistence.  I&#39;m grateful that there are <br/>\npeople who do pay attention to such things, but we don&#39;t ALL have to live <br/>\nright at that point of awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut still, I wouldn&#39;t care if our local school was getting the money they <br/>\nwould get if my kids were in.  I wish they would.  I wish our departure would <br/>\nmean better student-teacher ratios, and more money to go around for the kids <br/>\nremaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3067,"nextTopicId":3142}}
