While the friends are over, enjoy the pockets of time that gives you and your husband to spend together!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs our kids grow, we parents should be flexible about how we can comfortably fit within our kids&#39; lives. My husband and I often adapt how we spend time with our son. There are things we ask if he&#39;s interested in doing with us (camping trips, going swimming, going fishing, going to the movies, playing video games), but we don&#39;t plan those things without finding out if he&#39;s interested and we don&#39;t schedule them without checking with him to find out what he has going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he had friends over and my husband and I wanted for the three of us to go do something, we would&#39;ve talked about it before the friends came over and made plans accordingly. BUT my husband and I would also be flexible about those plans, so that if our son asked if we could do those plans a different day and his friend could stay over later instead, that would generally not be a problem. (I say &quot;generally&quot; because if we had prepurchased tickets for something for a specific time and day, we wouldn&#39;t want to cancel that unless we were all three okay with canceling it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nScheduled &quot;family time&quot; in our household is agreed-upon by all family members who will be participating. And we&#39;re all flexible about changing it if someone is involved in something they&#39;d really rather not stop. No one person&#39;s wants are more important than another person&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: summertime kids","postDate":"1275860914","msgId":54677,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1aDUzaStkdXN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1Z2FiOStxaXFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54664,"nextInTopic":54680,"prevInTime":54676,"nextInTime":54678,"topicId":54655,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===If one parent decides that this time is family time and insists that it be that way in spite of disagreement from other family members, that s not very","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1866315625\">===If one parent decides that this time is family time and insists that it be that way in spite of disagreement from other family members, that&#39;s not very unschooly, is it?===<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s pretty disrespectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s the dynamics, it won&#39;t create an environment in which a child will be willing to stop what he&#39;s doing with friends to spend time with a parent who wants to control how everyone&#39;s time is spent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===But what do you do if the child gets so upset about not being able to play with friends (even if he&#39;s been playing with them almost all day) that he refuses to do anything with the family?===<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can force the family time, but you can&#39;t force enjoyment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere has to be some sort of positive connection to &quot;family time&quot; for a child to want to step away from what their already enjoying. Even then, the transition itself from one to the other may not always be enjoyable, but if the time being spent with the family *is*, then things will balance back out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===And it&#39;s not acceptable to the parent to go into a private room while the kids play in a different part of the house?===<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s *nothing* that can be done to make that an acceptable option?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even in a communal room of the house, if the kids are playing in your son&#39;s room with the door closed, that&#39;s still too noisy?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only option (in your hubby&#39;s mind) is that the friends not be in the house?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===I guess I&#39;m asking where you draw the line between what the child wants and what the parent wants when an agreement cannot be worked out.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you draw a line, at least one person is going to be unhappy, and that&#39;s not going to create a positive relationship between parent(s) and child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent expects a child to respect the parent&#39;s desire for family time, the parent needs to show respect for the child&#39;s desire for time with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than approaching it from the perspective of &quot;I&#39;m home from work so we will spend time together now&quot;, maybe your husband could build up his relationship with your son by going into your son&#39;s room (after your son&#39;s friends are gone) and showing an interest in whatever he&#39;s doing -- in a way that reflects that he&#39;s interested in spending time with his son in whatever way is interesting to his son. Not even necessarily doing things together, rather just being in the same room. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt shouldn&#39;t be a situation of &quot;your friends OR me&quot;; spend time with him after his friends are gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour hubby might get more bang for his buck by telling your son, &quot;I enjoy your company and would like to do something with you this week (or this weekend).

Make time with the family fun. But what do you do if the child gets so upset about not being able to play with friends (even if he&#39;s been playing with them almost all day) that he refuses to do anything with the family? And it&#39;s not acceptable to the parent to go into a private room while the kids play in a different part of the house? Do you still force the parents&#39; wishes on the child or do you accept that at this moment the child&#39;s desires are more pressing than the parents? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking, in the big scheme of things, adults have a better understanding that there is time for many things and there are several options to any given situation. So it&#39;s up to the parents to find ways to get their needs met without imposing on their children. If one parent decides that this time is family time and insists that it be that way in spite of disagreement from other family members, that&#39;s not very unschooly, is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m asking where you draw the line between what the child wants and what the parent wants when an agreement cannot be worked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":391315839,"authorName":"Liz Struk","from":"Liz Struk &lt;lizmikeerinryan@...&gt;","profile":"lizmikeerinryan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"summertime kids","postDate":"1275768415","msgId":54655,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5MzY3NS4zMjI2NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTM4MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54664,"prevInTime":54654,"nextInTime":54656,"topicId":54655,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"in regards to the dad wanting no friends over - my first thought was I remember how I resented the way my parents made our friends leave when my dad was coming","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-976761119\">in regards to the dad wanting no friends over - my first thought was I remember how I resented the way my parents made our friends leave when my dad was coming home.  BUT my parents didn&#39;t interact with us kids at home the way we do now w/ our kids.  We tell our kids &quot;today is a family day&quot; all the time and they have no problem with it, because we&#39;re doing things together, even if it&#39;s just vegging on the couch, eating snacks and watching a movie together.  On nice days, we&#39;re swimming together.  My husband and son do a lot of yard work together, go 4-wheeling together, play X-box together, run to Home Depot, etc, together.  They get their friend time too, but lots of family time, and it seems a good balance.  But I do find I have to be very strict with saying when friend time is up - the kids will beg and plead like they&#39;re dying (no matter how much time they&#39;ve recently spent w/ the friends - it&#39;s never enough - it can be a 4-day sleepover, and<br/>\n it&#39;s not enough).  But when the cut is made, and we&#39;re home spending the family time, all is well... it&#39;s like dragging a kid from a birthday party - it&#39;s a struggle to get them to leave, but it settles down once they&#39;re away from the festivities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54715,"nextTopicId":54724}}
