It has fallen into place for me and makes <br/>\nsense and feels totally just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to FEEL fine about that means that I have to feel fine about them NOT <br/>\nlearning things that I deep down DO wish they would be interested in <br/>\nlearning. NOW!!! &lt;BEG&gt; I have to learn patience and have confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to feel fine about that is to accept it that there are going to be <br/>\ngaps and delays and times when the kids don&#39;t appear to &quot;measure up&quot; to <br/>\nschool standards, etc., and know that there are times you might become more <br/>\naware of that as an issue and to, AT THE SAME TIME, be totally aware of and <br/>\namazed and wrapped up in the cool things they ARE learning and doing and <br/>\nsupport and facilitate those. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - when the kids were littler - it helped me to watch what they were doing <br/>\nand think about what they were getting out of it. They do everything for a <br/>\npurpose, even if they appear to be &quot;just vegging&quot; I&#39;ve discovered that those <br/>\ntimes are very very important for &quot;centering&quot; or &quot;integrating&quot; or whatever <br/>\nyou want to call it. I learned that after we did something that involved a <br/>\nlot of new input -- going to a cool museum or a show or reading a fairly <br/>\nintense book, for example, that they needed plenty of relaxed free play time <br/>\nto really have the chance to reflect on what they&#39;d experienced and to put it <br/>\ntogether with what they already knew and to just think about the way that new <br/>\nknowledge or experience changed other things already in their head, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to make it clear that those learning moments that look that <br/>\n&quot;academic&quot; as the long division example, can be few and far between, it isn&#39;t <br/>\nlike that is how our lives are every minute of every day. But they do happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was alerted to look for the value of what the kids chose to do on their <br/>\nown, a long time ago, when my sister&#39;s son was standing, a dazed look on his <br/>\nface, with his finger poked into a little hole in an old junky piece of <br/>\nfurniture. He was &quot;feeling&quot; the padding inside - pulling it out - poking it <br/>\nin - rubbing it between his fingers. My sister and I were ready to go <br/>\nsomewhere and she saw what he was doing and stopped and said, &quot;Wait - let <br/>\nAlex finish.&quot; I had no kids yet and was sort of dumbfounded - wait for him to <br/>\nfinish what? He didn&#39;t appear to be DOING anything. My sister pointed out <br/>\nthat he was experiencing the texture of that padding - and experimenting with <br/>\nhow it felt and how he could shape and reshape it and so on -- anyway - she <br/>\nwas very sensitive to the fact that he was mesmerized by the whole thing - it <br/>\nwas a very sensual experience for him. He was 3 or 4 years old. I was SO <br/>\nimpressed and from that moment on I watched children and realized that <br/>\nwhatever they do, there is a reason, and that, whenever possible, adults <br/>\nwould be well advised to respect it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"long division..","postDate":"1016813627","msgId":5731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzN3hTZnIyblZtcmtnZTB5QUUwMDAxY2E0OUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5746,"prevInTime":5730,"nextInTime":5732,"topicId":5731,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... day - she wanted to figure out how many days it would take to drive there and back.
