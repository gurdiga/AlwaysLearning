I will try to give a &quot;brief&quot; background, but it may get long.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9-year-old step-son, Julian, lives with my husband and me full-time.  He sees his bio-mom about once a week, sometimes less.  She is mainly unable and somewhat unwilling to care for him, so parenting falls completely to us.  Fine with me.  I love him and I want to raise him as I want to raise my biological children.  For what it&#39;s worth, I have a 9-month-old daughter and another babe on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian has been home-schooled since Kindergarten, by his grandmother, my husband&#39;s mother.  We call her Gram.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my husband was busy and the bio-mother was also busy/unavailable, Gram became something of a surrogate mom to Julian when he was very young.  When I came along four years ago, this caused some tension, although I think it is getting easier, necessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve transitioned from working full-time to being a full-time mom, and as my husband&#39;s home business has become more viable, we have less need of Gram&#39;s help, and I&#39;ve become more a part of the home-learning.  It started with me taking on Julian&#39;s lessons every now and then when Gram couldn&#39;t.  Believe me, I&#39;ve wanted to take over for a long time.  I can&#39;t wait to do so, actually, but we are trying to spare Gram&#39;s feelings and help her remain involved in Julian&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past several months, Gram brought up her hope that I could start to take over more (woo hoo!), and we switched to her coming only three days a week.  I&#39;ve had to take a deep gulp and follow the path she has set -- a very structured curriculum, a set schedule, lots of worksheets and &quot;teaching&quot; and school at home, sitting quietly at a desk for hours and hours.  Not my idea of a great learning environment, partially because I see how ineffective it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere had been talk of her backing out completely as of the first of the year, this year, as in, a few days -- but she has become more reluctant about that as the deadline approached.  At this moment, with us planning to start back on Tuesday, I have no idea what she is planning.  She has made comments in the past few weeks about wanting to &quot;crack down&quot; on Julian for some of his writing &quot;laziness,&quot; and she wants to do some history stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to talk with my husband about this the other day, and he asked me what I want to do -- I said I want to become Julian&#39;s &quot;teacher,&quot; for lack of a better word.  Facilitator, cruise director, whatever you want to call it.  I want to start helping him learn in ways that will keep him interested in learning.  I want Gram to be Gram, and I want her to stop beating him over the head with &quot;school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if Gram calls me Monday morning to talk about the plan this week for school, I am going to try to use my assertive self and let her know that we&#39;re going to take this week and get started on our own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to vent too much here about the things she&#39;s done to derail his interest in learning, but...it could fill volumes.  She obviously hasn&#39;t done it intentionally -- she wants him to love learning just as much as any teacher wants their pupils to love it.  But it has become a means to an end for him -- something you do only to avoid punishment or earn reward.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bright, curious (CRAZY curious, never stops asking questions), lovely boy who has learned in the past four homeschooling years that he hates school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe dreads the word &quot;school.&quot;  He hates it.  He rushes to finish his assignments, because he wants to get to the fun stuff (video games).  He looks at anything we get him or anything that could potentially be labeled &quot;educational&quot; with great skepticism.  We have a &quot;school room&quot; in our house that he avoids at all costs, unless he is forced to be &quot;at school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the situation I&#39;m starting with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy plan for Tuesday morning is this:  first, Julian is going to help me transplant my old spider plant.  Then, we&#39;re going to organize the kitchen and the refrigerator together.  We&#39;re going to get on World of Warcraft together (his beloved game) and start new characters in a new realm with a new guild that I discovered through this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to check out his stuff he got for Christmas: a new International Peace Corps Calendar (he had one last year and loved it), his Rush Hour game, code breaker book, etc.  We&#39;re going to look up some recipes online and decide what to make for supper.  I&#39;m going to let him choose if he wants to be in charge of ingredients or tools, or if he wants to do something else.  He has been DYING to cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to avoid the school room.  We&#39;re not doing any &quot;subjects.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re maybe going to look at his Webelos scout book and pick out a craft project (he&#39;s been talking to me about clay, and wanting to play with it, so I&#39;m thinking we might go that direction).  We might pull out his violin for a little jam session.  We&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we&#39;ll go through his new toolbox and all the tools he got for Christmas, maybe think of a woodworking project.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is what I&#39;m thinking for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDown the road, I&#39;m going to have to find ways to tell his Gram, somehow politely, that we don&#39;t have to answer to her about the way Julian is learning.  His dad and I are on the same page.  We have a home business based on growing hydroponic lettuce, and this summer, Julian has already decided he&#39;s going to grow some of his own crops to sell at market.  We really only need to answer to Julian&#39;s mom, and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to be okay with this, even though we may have to submit to some types of testing at some point, to appease her.  We&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Indiana, where rules are very relaxed.  180 days of attendance must be documented.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, we&#39;re on our own.  Julian has a million passions, not least of which are blacksmithing, building stuff, playing video games (especially World of Warcraft), cooking, drawing, learning guitar, violin, reading (especially fantasy stuff), growing things with his dad, puzzles and puzzle games...and he LOVES his baby sister, who he wants to help and play with all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of turning the school room into a propagation room -- it&#39;s got a great floor to ceiling south-facing window.  I&#39;m going to just get rid of his bad associations with school and change it completely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI anticipate a few things at the start:  Julian will say, &quot;Wait, aren&#39;t we doing school today?&quot;  And he&#39;ll think he&#39;s &quot;getting away with something,&quot; and he&#39;ll be all excited to tell Gram that he didn&#39;t do anything for school.  He&#39;ll brag to his older sister, who goes to public school, that he didn&#39;t have to do school today.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I talk to HIM about this?  He will have questions -- many.  How do you discuss this with your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about maybe having a heart-to-heart with him about learning -- why we bother learning anything, what is important to know (I have to be careful here; anything that smacks of criticism of his Gram will be quite stoutly defended; I may have to use some more diplomatic language); about how he learned when he was a baby, and how we, his parents, learn as adults -- I am not sure how to approach this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not a lazy boy.  He LOVES making lists and checking things off on his lists, especially if he decides what goes on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I know our situation is a bit unusual, but any advice is appreciated, and I wanted to introduce our situation because I&#39;ll probably be on here a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49354,"nextTopicId":6449}}
