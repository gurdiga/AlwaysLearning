(A totally <br/>\nunderstandable reaction to life&#39;s circumstances, I think...)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he is getting work, in a depressed economy, on his own,<br/>\nwithout a job coach, by talking to EVERYBODY.

Until then, she had been in school since age 5.  Her first year home was a learning experience for both of us.

It was hard for me but she really needed time and space to just BE.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen about 2 months ago she got the urge to get her learner&#39;s driving permit and a part-time job.

She doesn&#39;t know what she is going to do just yet, but is feeling free and happy.  Her schooled friends are starting their senior high school year on Monday and she is ecstatic that she not only isn&#39;t going but that she feels really good about her lifestyle.  The start of last school year was rough because she questioned her choice to leave, especially with her friends and her dad & stepmom freaking out.
