I send the link to anyone who asks &quot;unschooling? what<br/>\nis it you do with the kids all day?&quot;  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave written below:<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n*The first and most obvious thing is working towards acceptance that<br/>\n*right now* your mom needs aren&#39;t going to get met as much as you<br/>\nmight like.*<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nTrue.... &quot;right now&quot; just overwhelms me sometimes and the lack of outside<br/>\ninput... no friends really, lack of resources... libraries etc... tend to<br/>\ncolor my views and make my day seem longer than it is.  But acceptance of it<br/>\nall, as it is, is important.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n*It seems like a little thing, but mental shifts can actually be a<br/>\nhuge thing. Fighting against the idea that little kids are needy of<br/>\nmom, only adds more frustration. When we accept that &quot;This is where I<br/>\nam *for now*,&quot; it makes the process of finding solutions a lot<br/>\neasier. When we hold onto expectations that aren&#39;t likely to be met,<br/>\nit just adds to the burden.*<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI could not agree more.  thanks for reminding me of this.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n*If you don&#39;t *expect* your needs to get met now while your kids are<br/>\nyoung, then when your needs are met it feels like a bonus :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *do* grow up. Their needs next week, next year, in five years<br/>\nwon&#39;t be the same as they are right now.<br/>\n*<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nTrue.  And there are lovely growing-up moments all the time... that make me<br/>\naware of the fleeting nature of it all.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n*Sometimes it rains. Getting angry about the rain, getting angry that<br/>\nit isn&#39;t sunny just adds more misery. This is obvious *and yet* it&#39;s<br/>\nso easy to fall into the trap of negative thinking. Somehow it feels<br/>\nsatisfying to release the anger and let the universe know we&#39;re<br/>\nangry. But it doesn&#39;t help. In the moment it might feel like a pot<br/>\nletting off steam, but in the long run it&#39;s really just adding steam<br/>\nto an already steamy room. It&#39;s good to work at letting go of the<br/>\nfrustration at what we can&#39;t change to help us help ourselves, so we<br/>\naren&#39;t getting in the way of our own happiness.*<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFunny...i say this to my 5.5 yr old... when he complains about the heat..<br/>\nand then i help channel his energy elsewhere.  Well, I should use some of<br/>\nthis myself :-)<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n*And what helps even more than letting go of the frustration and anger<br/>\nis seeking out the good and the parts you love about right now. And<br/>\nwhen your thoughts start heading down a negative path, refocus on the<br/>\ngood. Look at the delighted smiles on their faces. See the world<br/>\nthrough their eyes. Look at their tiny fingers. Find ways to be<br/>\ndelighted. That will help you not need as much away from them for<br/>\nthis time period when they need you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing you can do. Can you find someone<br/>\nwho can take them for a regular period each week? Can you get up a<br/>\nlittle earlier and have some alone time?*<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLike i posted a few min ago... have found a young girl to play with my 2.5<br/>\nyear old... who seems to really like her.  so feeling more golden than i<br/>\nhave in ages.  And the waking up earlier has been happening... just that<br/>\nonce i&#39;m up... the 5.5 yr old tends to wake up.... and loves early morning<br/>\nreading and attention.  rare for him to be in bed no matter how late he<br/>\nsleeps... if the sun is up, so is he :-O<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i get your drift.. ... and shall focus on the moment&#39;s delight and not<br/>\nthe rain. Don&#39;t like myself for wanting time away from them... makes me feel<br/>\nlike i&#39;m failing them.  Besides due to Dh not being around... he plays catch<br/>\nup every w&#39;end... and the kids prefer me to be around even when dh is<br/>\navailable.  helps smooth out the various areas that were not radically<br/>\nunschooled before... and now are.  and dh is still only beginning to get it<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n*Do you have specific needs? Maybe someone has some ideas. I know the<br/>\ncultures a bit different, but you never know. And something someone<br/>\nsays might help you see things in a new way and help you see a<br/>\nsolution that would work for you. So, maybe don&#39;t look directly at<br/>\ntheir solutions, but try to see how they&#39;re maybe seeing the problem<br/>\nfrom a different angle than you are.*<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nthis is a good point.  I shall have to write when i have time and compelte<br/>\nconcentration.  My lack of concentration due to the ages of the kids and<br/>\ntheir needs.... makes me wary of starting a thread online.  Mostly... need a<br/>\nfew more months here before the kids agree to move about a bit by<br/>\nthemselves... or have friends whom they can play with without me around<br/>\netc..  At present i have to be in the same room mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Joyce!!<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHema A.
