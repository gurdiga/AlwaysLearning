He&#39;s<br/>\ninto dinosaurs and dragons and beasts in general, and has a lot of plastic<br/>\nfigurines, and sometimes he just wants to sit and bang them together<br/>\nenacting battles.  The outcome seems to be based on rules I don&#39;t fully<br/>\nknow, gleaned from movies and shows he&#39;s seen (one rule he reminded me of<br/>\nlast night:  King Kong *always* beats T-Rex).  But the game really is just<br/>\nabout one toy hitting another, and the struck toy flies across the room and<br/>\nis dead, but then comes back to life after a dragon toy goes over and<br/>\nbreathes on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to wrestle, build stuff with blocks or megabloks, line up toys and<br/>\nknock them down with balls or blocks, throw balls or pillows at each other<br/>\nor up and down the stairs...just about *anything* other than banging plastic<br/>\ntoys together and saying &quot;grrrrrrrr&quot; &#39;til my throat hurts.  And even when<br/>\nI&#39;m happily doing toy monster battles with him, it just never seems I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing it &quot;right&quot;.
