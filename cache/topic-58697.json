And taking her out of school was a huge START. I joined and read some unschooling lists and couldn&#39;t believe what people were writing. It wasn&#39;t that I thought anyone was rude, but that what they were suggesting was so...different! It seemed pretty far out there... . I got off the unschooling lists because it was just too much to take in! It was radical! But ...<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I&#39;m happy for my almost grown child that I made the effort to change, to stop listening to the conventional world. I wasted time insisting it was okay to just do part of it, or most of it for a while longer. And I held on to my exceptions because our situation was &quot;a little different&quot;, and you people wouldn&#39;t quite understand if I tried to explain it to you. Well, that was then. Now I can say that you (the list owners and the other really wise people who participate) - Thank You! You DO know.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest is in the comments here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2011/01/is-unschooling-too-big-gamble.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2011/01/is-unschooling-too-big-gamble.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58653,"nextTopicId":58710}}
