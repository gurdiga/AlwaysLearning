And it got a lot of good responses and I&#39;m sure a lot of  <br/>\npeople got good ideas from it.

About a year and a half ago,<br/>\nChamille, wanting to find like minded friends, signed up for a library<br/>\nanime/manga club.  She was really excited about going and it was geared<br/>\nto kids specifically her age.  She went to one meeting and it was a<br/>\nhorrible experience for her.  All the other kids had come with at least<br/>\none other friend, it was in a large space and everyone sat seperately,<br/>\nleaving Chamille sitting by herself, and the leader of the group didn&#39;t<br/>\ngather everyone up to do introductions or any other group cohesive<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called the library and told them what happened and how dissappointed<br/>\nwe were that a leader at the library would allow for any kid to feel<br/>\nleft out in a group dynamic and start a meetup without at least informal<br/>\nfriendly introductions.  It was set up like a classroom, the leader<br/>\nstanding in front and all the kids sitting there listening.  They<br/>\nassured me that they&#39;d talk with the leader of the group, did so, and<br/>\ngot back to me to let me know that they&#39;d be doing introductions and<br/>\nmore casual friendliness at the next meetup.  However, Chamille refused<br/>\nto go again because the first experience was so yucky for her, after she<br/>\nhad bravely got up the nerve to jump into a potential social situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no amount of convincing her that it would be different the<br/>\nnext time, that made her want to give it another go.  In general with<br/>\nthese sorts of things, the person leading the group is a volunteer,<br/>\ngenerously giving of their time wether they know what they are doing or<br/>\nnot, so I&#39;ve always figured that feedback was important.  It never<br/>\ngauranteed that my kids would give it another chance, but knowing that I<br/>\nwas trying to help the situation be better, has always helped them feel<br/>\nbetter, especially for Chamille because she cares about people and was<br/>\nhappy that it wouldn&#39;t happen to another kid like her.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] insight into meeting divergent needs","postDate":"1229202181","msgId":40999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMTJFM0QwLUU3NzMtNDkxRC1BOTc3LTY0ODUzQkZGMkJGOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5NDQxQjc0LjUwNTAzMDZAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PEM1MjE4NTQyMEZFODRBQjg5Qjg5RDE1MzdEMDhDMjlFQExZTEFMQVAyPiA8MUUxRjQ5QTUtRDkxRS00QkU2LTk4NDItNzIyQUMzNDZGRkZEQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NjU3N0NCQzVFMzkyNEFFMTkwQUZFRERGQ0IwNzdEOEZATFlMQUxBUDI+IDw4RDlGRkI2Ri01QTFFLTQwOTItQTkwQi05QTQxRDE2MTdFODZAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDQ5NDQxQjc0LjUwNTAzMDZAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":40998,"nextInTopic":41000,"prevInTime":40998,"nextInTime":41000,"topicId":40892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Perhaps there was more read into her post than she ever intended?

Her children love her, MY children <br/>\nlove her, all the children she knows love her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is the antithesis of a complainer.

She is also one of my most valued and loved friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing Lyla, I know she was genuinely seeking advice/input/ideas, and <br/>\nmany of the ideas she was presented with were ones she had already <br/>\ntried.  She is a scientist of human nature and was looking for new ideas <br/>\nthat she might be able to adapt to her situation.  I also know her <br/>\nchildren well -- the question made perfect sense to me.  She has never <br/>\nblamed her children for anything.  On the contrary.

Now that you&#39;ve gotten lots of other  <br/>\nideas and posted again, dismissing them, I&#39;m going to say it anyway.  <br/>\nYou sound like people I know who aren&#39;t really looking for solutions,  <br/>\nbut who are really wanting to complain about how impossible their   <br/>\nparticular situation is. I&#39;m not entirely sure why they want to do  <br/>\nthat - but I&#39;m suggesting that you examine that possibility in yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best solution I can offer (and I have one extreme extrovert and  <br/>\none extreme introvert and another in-between) is to change your way of  <br/>\nthinking about it. Decide to think of this as an amazingly wonderful  <br/>\nincredibly positive aspect of your family and treat it that way. How  <br/>\nWONDERFUL that you have a child of each temperament. How wonderful  <br/>\nthat you are able and willing to find ways to nurture both of them in  <br/>\ntheir own ways. How wonderful that they (and you) learn to enjoy and  <br/>\nappreciate the diversity of human temperament. How wonderful that your  <br/>\ndaughter and son provide YOU with such a variety of life experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, multiple people living together ALWAYS have to &quot;work  <br/>\nthings out&quot; between them. That is a process that goes on and on -  <br/>\nalways changing in its dynamics, but never stopping. We all have that.  <br/>\nThere is no &quot;answer to the problem,&quot; there is only the day-to-day  <br/>\nthinking of each others&#39; needs as we go about living our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading your post, the one thing I kept thinking was that you&#39;re  <br/>\nlooking too hard at the conflicts, too hard at how hard this is. You  <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the solutions when your eyes are focused on the problem.  <br/>\nYou have to look at it a little more &quot;sideways&quot; - by that I mean,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t see it so black and white. Take bits of it and combine things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, your daughter likes to hang out with you and your women  <br/>\nfriends. Start a book club - once a month you have a group of women  <br/>\nfriends come over and everybody has read the same book. You have food  <br/>\n(everyone contributes) based on a theme related to the book you all  <br/>\nread. You might have a little related game, some decorations, people  <br/>\nmight even dress up. You spend a bit of time talking about the book,  <br/>\nmost of the time is socializing. (You can google how to run book  <br/>\nclubs, but do keep it casual and be creative with it.) Now you have  <br/>\none thing - once a month - that is a big social activity for you and  <br/>\nyour daughter, and your son can be home, in his room, doing what he  <br/>\nfeels like doing (if he&#39;s into it, he could help with the food,  <br/>\ndecorations, etc, beforehand, then disappear during the get-together).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing you could add to the mix - a weekly &quot;game day&quot; at your  <br/>\nhouse. Invite a group of kids to come to play RISK or some other  <br/>\nparticular game that your daughter might enjoy. Make cookies, provide  <br/>\na good nice clear comfy space and some background music. All you need  <br/>\nis a couple of kids and she&#39;s in a &quot;group.&quot; You could do this at your  <br/>\nhouse, so your son can, again, just hang out where he wants and you  <br/>\ncan be with him while you still hostess the game-players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you&#39;re going to say - you were looking for how to pattern  <br/>\nyour day-to-day existence, not for ideas of one-time activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer is that that IS how your day-to-day existence gets its  <br/>\n&quot;pattern,&quot; it is nothing more than the accumulation of all your plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter wants more activity? Help her get that by setting up  <br/>\nactivities for her and helping her with transportation. Can you  <br/>\nprovide as much of YOUR time in all these social activities as you  <br/>\nthink she wants? Probably not - you have time constraints as real as  <br/>\nbudget constraints. You have another child with different needs.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s just a flat-out reality that your whole family can accept and  <br/>\nadjust to in the exact same way you adjust to whatever your particular  <br/>\nincome level and standard of living are. You don&#39;t gain anything by  <br/>\nwishing it was different, you work it out - not by constantly  <br/>\nbemoaning how you don&#39;t have enough money, but by constantly focusing  <br/>\non spending it on what will give you the most satisfaction. Do the  <br/>\nsame with the kids. Spend your time with a positive energy, just like  <br/>\nyou do your money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your daughter wants to do two or three social outings in one day,  <br/>\none right on top of the other, and seems disappointed that you can&#39;t  <br/>\nmanage that because you feel the need to be there for your home-loving  <br/>\nson, don&#39;t focus on how you&#39;re not able to 100 percent meet all of  <br/>\nboth kids&#39; immediate desires. Focus on overall meeting their needs -  <br/>\nhers for more social life and his for more home life. Point out to her  <br/>\nwhat you WILL be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had this scenario in my family, quite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve spent hours at the beach with a large group of families. Roya is  <br/>\nenergized and happy and excited and doesn&#39;t want it to end, wants to  <br/>\nstart something else immediately with some of the people we just spent  <br/>\na lot of time with. Roxana is worn out, had enough, desperately wants  <br/>\nto go home and curl up with a book all by herself and recuperate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might arrange for Roya to go with some of the other people there and  <br/>\nhave dinner and spend the evening with them. I might invite a couple  <br/>\nof her friends to go home with us to watch a movie or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes I would not be able to arrange something and we&#39;d go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d pull into the driveway of our house and Roya would be, in her  <br/>\nvery high energy and demanding way, asking, &quot;What now?&quot; I&#39;d say,  <br/>\n&quot;Right now we go in the house and you find something to do on your own  <br/>\nfor a while because the rest of us need some down time.&quot; I&#39;d be  <br/>\nsympathetic, but I&#39;d feel okay about this because we DID spend the day  <br/>\nin a big social situation and Roxana really DID need the down time.  <br/>\nI&#39;d feel okay about it the same way I&#39;d feel okay about saying, &quot;Right  <br/>\nnow we can&#39;t buy a new American Girl doll, but we will do our best to  <br/>\nfigure out a way to get one for you.&quot; Meeting our kids needs doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmean we can (magically) overcome all real constraints - it means we  <br/>\nare willing to consider and be creative and try to do our best to  <br/>\nsupport our kids&#39; interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nice thing about this is that the kids will, over time, realize  <br/>\nhow we are truly trying to make life good for them and they will  <br/>\nappreciate it. My kids, at 17, 21, and 24, look around at how parents  <br/>\ngenerally are so very uncaring about children&#39;s needs and interests,  <br/>\nand they mention all the time how differently we treated them. This in  <br/>\nSPITE of the fact that I could not possibly claim that I could always  <br/>\ndo exactly what every kid wanted exactly when they wanted. It was  <br/>\nalways a matter of doing our best to balance what different people  <br/>\nwanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] insight into meeting divergent needs","postDate":"1228935902","msgId":40908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMjEwMTEwNXEyYjNkZGVkMnY4OGFhOGUzNTgwNzg4MmJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1NzdDQkM1RTM5MjRBRTE5MEFGRURERkNCMDc3RDhGQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","referencesHeader":"PEM1MjE4NTQyMEZFODRBQjg5Qjg5RDE1MzdEMDhDMjlFQExZTEFMQVAyPgkgPDFFMUY0OUE1LUQ5MUUtNEJFNi05ODQyLTcyMkFDMzQ2RkZGREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw2NTc3Q0JDNUUzOTI0QUUxOTBBRkVEREZDQjA3N0Q4RkBMWUxBTEFQMj4="},"prevInTopic":40907,"nextInTopic":40909,"prevInTime":40907,"nextInTime":40909,"topicId":40892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This was just a movie and maybe not very real life.

Taking off, when my husband came home helped a lot.  We could<br/>\nleave little sister at home and go do stuff for a few hours.  Sometimes<br/>\nwe just walked around downtown PDX and looked a window displays,<br/>\nsometimes we&#39;d go out for coffee or a movie or the mall.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing FrightTown was a huge big deal thing that helped A LOT!  It was 2<br/>\nlong days a week doing something hugely focused that lasted about 2<br/>\nmonths.  We did it just long enough to be ready to stop doing it by the<br/>\nlast day.  Now a month out, we miss it.  I try to take Chamille to the<br/>\ngrocery store with me while leaving Margaux behind with dad.  It&#39;s not<br/>\ntotally exciting, yet it&#39;s time away from home getting stuff done, and<br/>\ntime to talk and listen to music together and check stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to be available for any and all chances of outings with friends,<br/>\nand Chamille knows that, yet she&#39;s been reluctant to set stuff up<br/>\nherself, until VERY recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very similar issues in regards to meeting the needs of both my<br/>\nkids.  Margaux doesn&#39;t like to be pressured to go out and do things,<br/>\nexpecially if it&#39;s so her sister can get out.  If I set up stuff for<br/>\nMargaux without her sister, she&#39;s very into it.  So, unlike you, I have<br/>\nto kids that like to get out and about, but mostly not together, and the<br/>\nyounger one can&#39;t stay home alone yet, and my older one doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nlike to stay home alone all the time, sometimes, but not always. <br/>\nFinding things they both like, is hard because of the huge age<br/>\ndifference, and it&#39;s only getting more and more that way!<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille has a newish friend that has a car, so she may go do something<br/>\ntoday while Margaux and I are out doing Margaux stuff.  It&#39;s interesting<br/>\nthat Chamille has a friend with a car.  I have mixed feelings about it,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s a first and it could turn out great for everyone.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: [AlwaysLearning] insight into meeting divergent needs","postDate":"1228931438","msgId":40904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1NzdDQkM1RTM5MjRBRTE5MEFGRURERkNCMDc3RDhGQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFMUY0OUE1LUQ5MUUtNEJFNi05ODQyLTcyMkFDMzQ2RkZGREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM1MjE4NTQyMEZFODRBQjg5Qjg5RDE1MzdEMDhDMjlFQExZTEFMQVAyPiA8MUUxRjQ5QTUtRDkxRS00QkU2LTk4NDItNzIyQUMzNDZGRkZEQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40902,"nextInTopic":40907,"prevInTime":40903,"nextInTime":40905,"topicId":40892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i guess i should clarify - we do LOTS of special one time type things - i bring my daughter on moms night out - we have gone to conferences together, and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-173781881\">i guess i should clarify - we do LOTS of &quot;special&quot; one time type things - i bring my daughter on moms &quot;night out&quot; - we have gone to conferences together, and on mini-vacations together, just the two of us, and she has gone to visit relatives and do other things with people we are close to, without me as well.  the &quot;special&quot; times are not an issue carving out - it&#39;s the day to day every day, every week thing i am struggling with.  if she only has &#39;special&quot; things to look forward to, what would ever keep her from wanting to go back to school?  she is bored and disatisfied at home during the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy son is not into the idea of being &quot;babysat&quot;, nor does he form connections with others very easily....and all my friends/people he IS connected to either have young children of their own (younger) and no time for mentor relationships or are working during the day...<br/>\n<br/>\ni guess perhaps there are no easy answers here, i was just wondering how folks with kids of different extreme temperaments pattern their day to day lives....?<br/>\n<br/>\nLyla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] insight into meeting divergent needs","postDate":"1228926762","msgId":40901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFMUY0OUE1LUQ5MUUtNEJFNi05ODQyLTcyMkFDMzQ2RkZGREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM1MjE4NTQyMEZFODRBQjg5Qjg5RDE1MzdEMDhDMjlFQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","referencesHeader":"PEM1MjE4NTQyMEZFODRBQjg5Qjg5RDE1MzdEMDhDMjlFQExZTEFMQVAyPg=="},"prevInTopic":40899,"nextInTopic":40902,"prevInTime":40900,"nextInTime":40902,"topicId":40892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-as i was writing this, i was talking with a friend online and the only idea we came up with is to take my daughter out at night, after my son is asleep","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1985983845\">-=-as i was writing this, i was talking with a friend online and the  <br/>\nonly idea we came up with is to take my daughter out at night, after  <br/>\nmy son is asleep (around 10:30 or so) maybe once a week or so - to  <br/>\nhear music, watch belly dancing, or something fun and &quot;night lifey&quot;.  <br/>\nthat sounds great, and i think it will help (if i can stay awake!)  <br/>\nbut it still leaves all day every day with a fairly understimulated  <br/>\nchild who wants to get OUT and another to whom going out to do  <br/>\nANYTHING almost never sounds good, and mostly sounds torturous.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband doesn&#39;t work seven days a week, does he?
