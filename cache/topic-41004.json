She <br/>\nreally feels the taunting thing if she can see the boxes. Especially when we <br/>\nhave a fairly steady stream of things coming in the mail. Sometimes I am <br/>\nable to intercept the box and hide it before she sees it, but if a box is <br/>\nemblazoned with the name of the toy company as many are, it is futile to try <br/>\nto hide that the gift is for her. She was not of the temperament to happily <br/>\nplay with boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn opens her presents as they arrive if she wants to, and sometimes she <br/>\njust wants to know which have her name on it. Dh was saying that he wanted <br/>\nto be able to keep gifts for Christmas morning, so his idea was to change <br/>\nhow he did things, rather than try to change Jayn. If we want to keep gifts <br/>\nfor Christmas day, we hide them out of the house, like in the trunk of dh&#39;s <br/>\ncar. Hiding them in our house, which was possible when Jayn was smaller, <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work as we don&#39;t have hiding places (full to overflowing closets <br/>\nalready) and she snoops. The only consequence for her is that she will have <br/>\nfewer on the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that last year we had a sequence of small gifts for her to open <br/>\nin the week leading up to the big day. We sometimes re-wrap also, and we <br/>\nwill arrange the opened things from the couple of weeks under the tree to <br/>\nlook at also. Jayn is very clear on what is a &quot;Christmas present&quot; as against <br/>\njust a doll, for example. Meanwhile we see her aunt at some point and give <br/>\nand get gifts so sometimes Christmas keeps going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever this year, Jayn being 9, she had the opportunity to pick up her gift <br/>\nfrom her grandfather well in advance of Christmas. It is a doll ordered from <br/>\na local toy store. Instead she chose to wait until he arrives here to spend <br/>\nthe holidays with us, and make an outing of going to pick it up with him on <br/>\nChristmas eve. Doing this was all her delightful idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the tree looking nice, there are plenty of other gifts for other <br/>\nfamily members under it, an a porcelain village that I put under when the <br/>\ngifts go to keep it pretty. We don&#39;t miss Jayn&#39;s parcels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The joy in giving a gift for me is to see the person open it - to see their reaction and joy or surprise.  Though I do mail gifts to family all the time and do not get to see them open it.  Still, if I handed it to them, I&#39;d like to see them open it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve often seen young children - well anyone - hover and urge the receiver to open the gift as they too are experiencing the joy of gifting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is just family history playing a part in this - my family was a huge extended farm family.  For Christmas Eve we&#39;d gather and a few people at a time would open gifts and &quot;show&quot; everyone else and even pass it around so everyone could see what each person received.  It was an informal ritual, noisy & very fun that lasted the evening.  We moved around, got snacks, drinks, chatted and played around.  When I married, my husband&#39;s family would pass out all the gifts and open them all at the same time (in about 5 minutes) and I was very disappointed as I did not know what people &quot;got&quot; and did not get to see them open my gifts to them - it seemed like we were not sharing the experience together - it was more of a &quot;what did I get&quot; feeding frenzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Joyous Anticipation or Pure Frustration?","postDate":"1229278699","msgId":41018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1YS4zN2YwYThkNy4zNjc2YTdlYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41017,"nextInTopic":41019,"prevInTime":41017,"nextInTime":41019,"topicId":41004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/14/2008 12:02:58 PM Eastern Standard Time, Sandra@SandraDodd.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-475448070\">In a message dated 12/14/2008 12:02:58 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I always did let my kids wrap things up--their own toys,  gifts for <br/>\ntheir dolls and stuffed animals, gifts for each other, and to  play <br/>\naround with things that way.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids have a huge amount of things they like to wrap.

We then gave her<br/>\nthe choice to use them immediately or save them (the point, after all,<br/>\nwas mostly to make her happy in the first place) and she chose to save<br/>\nthem: &quot;But let&#39;s hide them better so they don&#39;t keep taunting me.&quot; So<br/>\nwe found a place to keep them where she wouldn&#39;t come into daily<br/>\ncontact with them and she talks about them occasionally but has not<br/>\nwanted to get them out.

See if that helps maybe.  You could even have the 12 days of Christmas tradition where you give a small gift each day until Christmas.  Maybe a trip to the thrift store or the dollar store would do the trick for these gifts.  I remember when the dollar store and thrift store held great fascination and inexpensive items for our son at that age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there gifts your daughter could help wrap for others so she gets in on the other end of the specialness of surprises and gift giving?    Maybe craft projects of making gifts for others.  You know everyone thinks they are fantastic if the kid made them no matter what they look like.  I saw at Wal-Mart the other day packages of craft projects - like decorating a snowflake or tree made out of craft foam - there were something like 25 to a package for 4.98!!!!!  Oh and they had photo frame ornaments too in the shape of a snowman, penguin and something else for the same price - even drawing and coloring pictures for others, tracing your hands to make a wreath, a Christmas tree, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe fill her life up with other fun filled activities - maybe let her set the gift of her choice (her gift from under the tree) right beside her - let her carry it around.  If the paper gets worn out or ripped you can always tape it or wrap it again.  OH how about a colorful cloth sack - or a gift bag to carry it in so it won&#39;t be as likely to get worn out or messed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244921700,"authorName":"Renee McGraw","from":"&quot;Renee McGraw&quot; &lt;woman.evolving@...&gt;","profile":"dazynay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Joyous Anticipation or Pure Frustration?","postDate":"1229262438","msgId":41004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJiN2FkYTU3MDgxMjE0MDU0N2c2MTMxMmNmOXVkZTAxYzI5MzQwZGYwNTFlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41006,"prevInTime":41003,"nextInTime":41005,"topicId":41004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Youngest dd, Kirsten is 4 1/2.

Yes, it makes<br/>\nfor a pretty tree, but it feels like pure torture for Kirsten.  She has sat<br/>\nbeside that tree holding one of her presents asking to open it off and on<br/>\nsince she noticed it was there.

He tells stories of how his mom used to have<br/>\nto run him away from the presents and such so now, it seems, the<br/>\nanticipation is just fun for him.  However it&#39;s not fun for Kirsten.  It&#39;s<br/>\ncausing much frustration that seems to be completely avoidable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI waited to put out her birthday presents until just a few hours before her<br/>\nparty this past summer and she was literally miserable.  She didn&#39;t even<br/>\nwant to go on with her party she just wanted to open her presents.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one hand it concerns me.  I don&#39;t want her to be selfish and only think<br/>\nabout the presents, but on the other hand she&#39;s only 4!  I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nthe expectation of her waiting patiently is a realistic one at this age.  Is<br/>\nselfish even the right word?  Maybe *impatient* is better.  But aren&#39;t we<br/>\nall impatient at times?  She *has* learned to wait for things and be as<br/>\npatient as her age and temperament allows her to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose *I* am frustrated because I don&#39;t want to undermine dh yet I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to put my child through what I see as unnecessary frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n......thoughts, ideas, examination of perceptions are appreciated!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRenee<br/>\nAnd the turtles, of course...
