About 2 months ago I kept<br/>\n&quot;wishing&quot; there was a book called &quot;The Organized Unschooler&quot;..  A book that<br/>\nwould give me some insight on how to get organized so that I don&#39;t feel so<br/>\noverwhelmed or didn&#39;t feel so overwhelmed with all the choices of activities<br/>\nthat we could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example I have found that having a very large cart in the kitchen with<br/>\nlots of art and crafts, coloring books, and stuff to do projects with is a<br/>\nmust (well for my kids).  I had so many things all over the place that my<br/>\nhouse was becomming way too messy (at least that I was comfortable being<br/>\nin)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI now also have another 3 tier cart with 3 drawers in it (it&#39;s on wheels)<br/>\nand in one of the drawers I put information about upcoming homeschooling<br/>\nevents in our area or that we might like to attend, such things are info<br/>\nfrom our homeschooling group, or student days at various events such as the<br/>\nRenaissance Fair in Phoenix, U of A Presents (matinee theatre for school<br/>\nkids 6 times a year) In another drawer I put information about on-going<br/>\nopportunities my kids might like, such as Karate places, Soccer Camps, Ice<br/>\nSkating (Zak just announced he wants to learn to play Ice Hockey in Tucson<br/>\nno less... LOL)....<br/>\nAnd in the third drawer I have ideas for projects or books about subjects<br/>\nthe kids have shown interest in, even if it was a glimmer of interest.  Also<br/>\nin that drawer places for me to follow up with such as looking to find out<br/>\nif there is a Lego Racers Competition, where and when it&#39;s held and whether<br/>\nwe want to go etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though we are unschooling there is some organization for me and my<br/>\nmental needs.... Mental being the appropriate word.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more containers now than I ever did to pile buckets, cars, trucks,<br/>\ntrains etc into without having them strewn everywhere and the next thing is<br/>\na table for projects (got this idea from Heather this afternoon) so they can<br/>\nkeep things out instead of putting them away (as we are using the kitchen<br/>\ntable).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe these seem simple to some people, but these were things I didn&#39;t<br/>\nrealize would make my life easier and also the kids, because they know where<br/>\nthings are kept now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn  Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4777,"nextTopicId":4665}}
