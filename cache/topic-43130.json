Through my research I have learned about the unschooling approach and feel that it would work well for us. I have already implemented some unschooling techniques and have seen a dramatic change in my daughter&#39;s behavior,confidence and desire to learn. I am pretty excited about learning along side her. My question is how do you contain and structure the learning to make it meaningful and long lasting. It seems we start on one subject or project and then it spins off to learning something else, then we start another topic etc, etc. It seems like the power of unsturctured learning is a little too much. I&#39;d hate for us to waste time and not learn things in depth. Any advice or suggestion would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.237 / Virus Database: 270.11.10/1996 - Release Date: 03/11/09 20:42:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with containing excitement about unschooling","postDate":"1236866840","msgId":43131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2M0FENUEzLTIyMDItNDI5NC1CREQ1LUZDNjI0N0Q2QTc0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdwYjM0Mys0Y3VnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdwYjM0Mys0Y3VnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43130,"nextInTopic":43134,"prevInTime":43130,"nextInTime":43132,"topicId":43130,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Help with containing excitement about unschooling-=- You re asking an oft-asked question, but in a whole new and better way!! #1, don t wait until next","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-128598585\">-=- Help with containing excitement about unschooling-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re asking an oft-asked question, but in a whole new and better way!!<br/>\n<br/>\n#1, don&#39;t wait until next year.<br/>\nIf she&#39;s in school, go and get her and bring her home.
