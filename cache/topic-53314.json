JEEEZ, THIS WEEK IS TIRING!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNONE OF THEM WENT TO COLLEGE. �Nuff said. Are they really educated?  <br/>\nDid they learn calculus? Did they read the great books? Notice how all  <br/>\nthe discussion focuses on how �mature� the kids are, a fuzzy concept  <br/>\nthat says nothing about their intellectual and academic achievement.  <br/>\nIntellectual development does not happen unless you are exposed to  <br/>\nthings you would not necessarily choose to be exposed to. The point is  <br/>\nnot for kids to spend 100% of their time in a feel-good pursuit of  <br/>\nwhat they�re already interested in. Those are hobbies, not education.  <br/>\nThis is, I think, part of American culture lately, where people only  <br/>\nwant information that confirms their existing biases, and stick their  <br/>\nheads in the sand for everything else. That is the very definition of  <br/>\nignorance.
