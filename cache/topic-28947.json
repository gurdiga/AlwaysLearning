Especially <br/>\nwhat Pam said about how it&#39;s not at all helpful to have thoughts of <br/>\nschool in the picture at all, even as a &quot;last resort.&quot;  So true!  I <br/>\nrealized it&#39;s like getting married and on your way up the aisle <br/>\nthinking &quot;If this doesn&#39;t work, I can always get a divorce.&quot;  It may <br/>\nbe true, but it&#39;s not going to help you commit to having good marriage <br/>\nno matter how difficult things get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had never had any doubts about unschooling before, so it was kind of <br/>\na scary thing to go through. Your responses really helped re-energize <br/>\nme. I knew I could count on you!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28929,"nextTopicId":28931}}
