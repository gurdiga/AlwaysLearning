Our group has around 60 families who use a wide variety of <br/>\nhomeschooling methods; we&#39;re not strictly unschoolers, though some <br/>\nmembers use that approach. If she&#39;s already contacted our group, and has <br/>\ndecided we aren&#39;t her cup of tea, I&#39;m not sure what good will come from giving <br/>\nher contact info that will simply direct her back to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reread the paragraph you included, and she sounds somewhat stressed, <br/>\nunderstandably. She mentions that the homeschoolers here tend to keep to <br/>\nthemselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious as to whether she&#39;s come to park days or parent meetings (the last <br/>\none was at my house), and what she expects of people she&#39;s just met, but I <br/>\nreally cannot picture anyone who belongs to our group not lending a <br/>\nsympathetic ear or trying to help or advise a new homeschooler if that person <br/>\nhas concerns. Getting to know new people is a two-way street, and being the <br/>\nnew person in a group of people who already know each other can be <br/>\nsomewhat intimidating. It takes time for both sides to reach a comfortable <br/>\nplace. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd quite honestly, if she&#39;s looking for &quot;free-thinking&quot; and &quot;left winged&quot; ours is <br/>\nthe group for her.  When I pulled my kids out of school after 3 years, I could <br/>\ncount on one hand the number of women that I had met through school who I <br/>\nfelt I was on the same wavelength with. When I joined our homeschooling <br/>\ngroup, I thought that I&#39;d died and gone to heaven, because I finally had the <br/>\nopportunity to socialize with other moms who read a lot, think about important <br/>\nthings, and march to the beat of a different drummer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she knows of our group, maybe she needs to meet a wider variety of our <br/>\nmembers and have some patience about forming friendships before she <br/>\ndecides we won&#39;t meet her needs, especially if she&#39;s new to homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can email me if she wants to.
