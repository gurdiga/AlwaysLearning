So the next time Nakita pooped upstairs, I caught him by the collar, and while Ed cleaned up the mess, I held his collar and talked to him, telling him how we don&#39;t do that and how disappointed I was and if he was going to be a part of the family and inside ... , etc.  Basically I just talked in a normal voice for 15 minutes.  Where a 5 second &quot;bad dog&quot; scolding had not worked - this 15 minute &quot;conference&quot; did the trick.  It was amazing to say the least.  His sister hung out close during the conference and we have not had a single other &quot;problem&quot; in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38381,"nextTopicId":38377}}
