Or ??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the differences between Latin and Greek Christianity.  The<br/>\nGreek word is &quot;mystery,&quot; not &quot;sacrament.&quot;  The Greeks simply never asked the<br/>\nquestion of &quot;when&quot;; it would never have occured to them.   I think the issue<br/>\nof Transubstantiation arose in Catholicism&#39;s scholastic period, which the<br/>\nEast never experienced.  The closest thing to an answer I&#39;ve heard was when<br/>\na priest was reminding people to show up on time, that the entire liturgy --<br/>\nthe &quot;common work&quot; of the people -- is necessary; you can&#39;t just show up<br/>\nright before the Anaphora (consecration) like it was take-out you ordered<br/>\nahead.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Greek word &quot;mysterion&quot; means something made present, not something<br/>\nhidden.  The Body and Blood are made present in the bread and wine, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think anyone imagines the bread and wine transform into actual human<br/>\nflesh and blood.  (I speak as an Orthodox, though, with no personal<br/>\nexperience of Catholicism; I could certainly be wrong.)  The manner in which<br/>\ncommunion is prepared and distributed is different between the Orthodox<br/>\nliturgy and the Catholic mass, too.  We use loaves of bread, baked at home<br/>\nby a member of the congregation each week, rather than wafers.  It would<br/>\ntake too long to explain all the details: suffice to say, each person is<br/>\nserved a combination of bread, wine and water on a spoon, from a common<br/>\nchalice.  Only a priest or deacon can serve; we have no Eucharistic<br/>\nministers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe consecrated Host is handled carefully, of course; cloth napkins are held<br/>\nbeneath the communicant&#39;s chin to catch spills.  Anything left in the cup is<br/>\nconsumed by the deacon.  Five or more loaves are brought each week, with one<br/>\nselected for communion.  The rest are sliced up into small pieces, and then<br/>\ndistributed as you receive communion.  This bread, called &quot;antidoran&quot; in<br/>\nGreek, is blessed but not consecrated, so you can take it home, and<br/>\nnon-Orthodox may receive it.  The crumbs are scattered for the birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are similarities between a liturgy and a mass, but some differences:<br/>\nThere is only one liturgy in a 24-hour period; you don&#39;t get to pick which<br/>\nMass to go to.  A priest never &quot;does&quot; a liturgy if there are no people<br/>\npresent, and he faces the altar with his back to the people, since everyone<br/>\nis thought of as serving, not just him.  If the church is correctly<br/>\nappointed, it will have no pews or seats; everyone stands, and those Russian<br/>\nservices can get long!  If there are seats in the way, you can&#39;t move with<br/>\nthe processions, you just spin around in one place.  It does help keep the<br/>\nkids from taking off, though :-)  Oh, that&#39;s another difference: infants are<br/>\nbaptised and immediately chrismated; they don&#39;t wait for their first<br/>\ncommunion at an older age.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I was going to answer the question with a line from The Prisoner:<br/>\n&quot;That would be telling.&quot;  After that tome, you probably wish I had!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Travelers carry food was Christian Unschooling","postDate":"1008866511","msgId":1122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTQwMWMxODk3NSQzOWI0OTc0MCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEyZi45OTU0MjYzLjI5NTM2ZGQ4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1121,"nextInTopic":1132,"prevInTime":1121,"nextInTime":1123,"topicId":986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the ...
