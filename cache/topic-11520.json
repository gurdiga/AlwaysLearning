I have a six<br/>\nyear old son, Thomas.  If he could dissect sentences I<br/>\nwould be astounded.  His 4 year old brother, Alex is<br/>\non the cusp of pre-reading, sounding out letters,<br/>\nidentifying letters in words by sound (in his head,<br/>\nnot looking at words) practicing drawing letters, and<br/>\nin general playing with letters.  He loves letter<br/>\nmagnets and a new spelling toy he got for Christmas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas just isn&#39;t that interested in letters, spelling<br/>\nor reading yet.  I&#39;m not worried about it.  I taught<br/>\nmyself to read at 4, but my older brother didn&#39;t read<br/>\nuntil 9.  Neither one of us learned from the stupid<br/>\npublic institution we were in, despite their best<br/>\nefforts to force him.  Make reading material readily<br/>\navailable to your son, as I am sure you do, and get<br/>\nhim books and magazines about subjects that he&#39;s<br/>\npassionate about, and it will come.  Try not to worry.<br/>\n He&#39;s still really young.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11470,"nextTopicId":11521}}
