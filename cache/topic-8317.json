Now they have a local<br/>\nteenager do odd jobs for them, including grocery shopping, pick up meds,<br/>\ndrive them to doctor&#39;s appts, mow the lawn, move large items around the<br/>\nhouse, etc.  They pay him  well for his time.  He is going off to college<br/>\nthis fall and his younger brother is going to take over most of the jobs for<br/>\nhim.  If the &quot;boys&quot; are unavailable sometimes their mother will help out<br/>\ntoo.
