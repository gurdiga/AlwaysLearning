That&#39;s 7 per day times 180 days times 7 years. In jr and senior <br/>\nhigh school, we had 8 periods a day with a buzzer to start each and <br/>\nanother buzzer to end each, plus a 5 minute warning before school and a <br/>\n5 minute warning before lunch period was over - so 18 per day for 180 <br/>\ndays per school year times 6 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople used to say community college was &quot;high school with ash trays.&quot; I <br/>\nused to add, &quot;And no buzzers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom taught a lab preschool program at a high school and I hung out <br/>\nthere a lot when my children were little. The buzzers and announcements <br/>\ngoing all the time were extremely distracting and annoying to me - I was <br/>\nvery very bothered by them. They didn&#39;t just have buzzers, but they had <br/>\nspeakers in every room and the &quot;office&quot; would be constant interrupting <br/>\nand making announcements throughout the day. Not just once or twice, I&#39;d <br/>\nsay more like 10 times per day - more than once per class period.
