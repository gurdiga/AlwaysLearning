But, I want to warn everyone of my personal experience that resulted in me not considering Spiral Scouts as an option.  I joined their main email list and it seemed to me that nearly every topic was on Paganism and how to tailor Spiral Scouts into a Pagan theme.  Yes they say they are a Pagan oriented system and welcome other relegious beliefs.  But, to me it felt as if Paganism was being spoon fed to me on a daily basis.  This bothered me a bit and when I made a comment about it I ended up stirring up the hornets nest.  I got the impression that they welcomed other religions, but you better be ready to do things the Pagan way or leave.  So, I left.<br/>\nIf you do decide to consider Spiral Scouts as an option, just be forwarned that they do take their Pagan foundation seriously.  I was told that Local Chapters could be made into what you wanted.  Spiral Scouts didn&#39;t sit well with me because I am soooo anit-organized religious and Spiral Scouts seemed too much like an organized Pagan religious foundation.  I guess to me it felt like I was back in Sunday School and all activities were based around the church and christianity.<br/>\nJust my 2 cents worth.<br/>\nTom Kuykendall<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2002 19:11:14 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Nanci Kuykendall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aisliin@...\">aisliin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Scouting Alternatives- An Option<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one was interesting to me, and some of you may be<br/>\ninterested as well.
