There is nothing like looking out your window and seeing your own <br/>\nhorses in your own back yard. I was raised with horses until I moved out of the <br/>\nhouse and always missed them in my life.

We were fortunate enough to have 2 barns already here when we moved <br/>\nin. One is a huge 3 story, beautiful, 100 yr. old hay barn and it&#39;s attached <br/>\nto our home! (part of the house is actually in the barn and we plan on adding <br/>\nmore &quot;some day&quot;) Sort of different but, we like it.

It seemed like such an impossible<br/>\ndream at the time but I was able to look at the reality of what stood<br/>\nbetween us and our dream of horse ownership, then I was able to address<br/>\nthose issues and make it happen.  It was the beginning of a wonderful<br/>\njourney for us~ an incredible learning/loving experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if I wrote about the purchase or our second horse last summer,<br/>\nbut Leigh, my 11 yo dd, took ownership of Sugar, our first horse, and we<br/>\npurchased a second horse for Lilly (8 at the time) named Snickers.<br/>\nUnfortunately, over the next few months we came to the realization that<br/>\nSnickers just wasn&#39;t going to work out.  (she bucked and spooked and spun<br/>\nand was just too much horse for Lilly once she got in shape) We ended up<br/>\nputting her up for sale last fall.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn January, someone came to look at her.  We explained the problems we were<br/>\nhaving with her. She asked us if we had found an appropriate mount for Lilly<br/>\nyet.  We told her no we hadn&#39;t.  She offered us a trade.our mare for her<br/>\nolder gelding.  We went to meet Skippy and try him out and even though we<br/>\nweren&#39;t positive that he would work out, we felt good about the trade<br/>\nbecause he was at least a safe horse that we felt we could work with and if<br/>\nnot, we knew we could sell him more easily because he didn&#39;t buck or take<br/>\noff on you, he was only a bit on the quick side and a little nervous.  And<br/>\nwe knew that Snickers was going to a good knowledgeable home where they<br/>\ncould handle her issues.  It was almost too good to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Skippy is working out working out really well and we love him a lot!<br/>\nA couple months ago we tossed around the idea of building a small barn and<br/>\nriding arena at home and in the end we decided to do it.  (it&#39;s always scary<br/>\ngoing further into debt but in this case, it&#39;s a win-win situation for us.<br/>\nOur barn loan payment will about equal our board payments and it&#39;ll increase<br/>\nthe value of our property to boot.)  I finally feel like I know enough about<br/>\nhorses to care for them ourselves (it&#39;s amazing what hands on experience<br/>\nwill do for you) and I feel very comfortable with handling both of our<br/>\nhorses and their quirks.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe wonderful and latest news is that our barn is almost finished!  Our<br/>\nfencing is all up and in about a week our horses will be coming to live at<br/>\nhome.  Because we won&#39;t be working at the boarding barn anymore (we shovel<br/>\nstalls and water 16+- horses 7 days a week most weeks in exchange for part<br/>\nof our board) we will have a lot more time to enjoy our own horses.  We&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to look out our windows and see our favorite furry friends at any<br/>\ntime of the day or night.  We&#39;ll have a lot more time to just enjoy them and<br/>\nhang out with them and we are really excited!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOur last name begins with an S and our horses&#39; names both begin with an S<br/>\nand so we decided to name our farm &quot;Big S Farm.&quot;  Say that three times fast!<br/>\nLOL! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI made a blog to show some pictures of our new barn if you want to check it<br/>\nout.  www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/\">http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] night owls and teens","postDate":"1146947187","msgId":25779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlGQkM2OTE4LUNCNTctNDFCNy05ODYzLTA1QzlBM0MwRkU2N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQUVKQURCQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQUVKQURCQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":25774,"nextInTopic":25782,"prevInTime":25778,"nextInTime":25780,"topicId":25716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I love that early morning time, but as the last thing in the <br/>\nday, not the first! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy doing that, but that would definately put us out of the <br/>\nsocial loop, so we&#39;re just a little off.  My 6 year old usually goes <br/>\nto bed about midnight or 1am and gets up about 10 or 11 and my 14 <br/>\nyear old maybe goes to bed about 2 or 3 and gets up about noon or <br/>\n1.  I go to bed anywhere from midnight to three (just after the 6 <br/>\nyear old) and get up about 8 or 9 or sometimes 10. :)  Works for <br/>\nus. :)   Breakfast at noon, dinner with daddy and snacks late at <br/>\nnight. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are mostly homebodies, so no problem most of the time, but when <br/>\nwe do schedule something, we try to schedule it in the afternoon. We <br/>\nhave a weekly playgroup at 1pm on Tuesdays and otherwise, just <br/>\nwhatever we arrange or comes up - we always suggest afternoon! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s something that&#39;s ONLY in the morning, like tomorrow we have <br/>\na play to go to (Sword in the Stone) we&#39;ll make it down there by <br/>\n9:30am, but our day will be a little off.  As long as it&#39;s only once <br/>\nin a while, we can handle it and just make up for the sleep lost <br/>\nanother day.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up, my parents always told me what what the right and wrong <br/>\nway to do everything, but I never got a copy of the manual! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nc.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marty & Mary Alterman&quot; <br/>\n&lt;malterman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have an eleven year old son who is a major night owl.
