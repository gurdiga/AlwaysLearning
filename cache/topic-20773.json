How much traffic do you get at the end of your driveway? Is it<br/>\nenough to get some business?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is now 12 but started the business bug when she was 8 also. We<br/>\nlived in the country then, and it was really tough to satisfy this roadside<br/>\nstand craving of hers as well. We went into more populated areas to find a<br/>\ngood spot to set up a table, and even checked out the different grocery<br/>\nstores, etc. to see what it would take for her to set up there (permission,<br/>\nand in some cases, a permit). She did sell lemonade and cookies<br/>\nsuccessfully. She also wanted to sell more, but ran into the problem that<br/>\nshe never quite made enough creative things (arts and crafts, etc.) to cover<br/>\nwhat she figured out to be the costs of having the table (she added the cost<br/>\nof gas, put a cost to her own time [though not mine!] and the cost of<br/>\nsupplies). So there were ups and downs for her, and I think one key is that<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to solve all the problems, but just keep thinking with her.<br/>\nShe may want to try things that you are pretty sure won&#39;t work (those were<br/>\nhard times for me, especially if it took a lot of work to get somewhere!),<br/>\nbut then she&#39;ll see. And you&#39;ll get to figure out more together!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter learned so much during this stage. She often had more ambition<br/>\nfor the end sale than she could figure out a way to get to, but she is SO<br/>\nbusiness-smart now, in part because of figuring out things back then. So<br/>\nmuch problem-solving was done. It was discouraging to not find places to<br/>\nsell easily, and to have problems hauling it all there without losing<br/>\nanything, and the weather element, etc. BUT it was very &quot;educational&quot;. She<br/>\nis still entreprenuer-like...she has a neighborhood pet-care business now.<br/>\nAnd she plans to run her own dance company when she&#39;s older...at least<br/>\nthat&#39;s the plan now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
