He usually had me fly through certain sections that he couldn&#39;t yet do.  I got pretty good at flying a tie fighter.  He also LOVED the Reading/Math Blaster series and  was disappointed when he had played them all and the next level game was so schooly, just not fun at all.  The remote control and TV listings were no problem even for my later reading children who could recognize their favorite shows on a list years before they could read a book.  These days, my youngest has access to hundreds of games via the web.  She Loves the kind of facebook games where you build a little world (pets, cafes, gardens etc) and interact with other users.  Interestingly, she didn&#39;t get the hang of the remote until age 8 or so just because she was more interested in the computer than the TV and her brother or sister or I or her dad were always on hand to find her shows for her.  But even with all the help, she still discovered things to watch that we hadn&#39;t thought of and shared them with us just as we share things we think she will like with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula Moyer<br/>\nThe Seer, the novel <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50352,"nextTopicId":50419}}
