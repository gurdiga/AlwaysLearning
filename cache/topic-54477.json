Wolfgang is 15. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day the kids, Jeff and I were outside when a boy rode by on the bike. <br/>\n<br/>\nJeff followed the boy and got it back. He gave it up without contesting just acted as though he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know....but he gave it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWolfgang saw the kid at the lake a couple of days later. He didn&#39;t talk to him. <br/>\nHe&#39;s never talked to him. He *looks* like a trouble sad kid, smoker, <br/>\ndrugs etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home Wolfgang said, &quot;I think I&#39;d like to give him the <br/>\nbike. I have another one now and don&#39;t need it. Plus if I give him the bike <br/>\nhe&#39;ll be less likely to go steal someone else&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he posted that on his facebook page asking for feedback. A mother of a friend of Wolf&#39;s responded.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nWolfgang Halldorson: went swimming pretty packed but, the water was nice. <br/>\nGot to see who stole my bike thinking about just giving it to him because he <br/>\ni just going to steal another one and him having my bike would decline that <br/>\nrisk and plus i have another bike that i like more so it is all cool<br/>\n<br/>\nfriends mother: I like the thought but not the fact that he would be <br/>\nrewarded for his stealing.<br/>\nTuesday at 9:40pm<br/>\n<br/>\nWolfgang Halldorson: the kid gave it back without a problem and he would not <br/>\nhave the need to steal another one if he had mine.
