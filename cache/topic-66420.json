Especially since as adults we often impose habits that HAVEN&#39;T worked for us. On several occasions I&#39;ve asked friends to trace back the origins of the rules they impose on their children. They mostly come from their childhood experiences and 99% of the time they hated the rules. Yet we continue to impose them (myself included).  They seem to find value in having had a relatively unhappy/unfulfilled childhood just because they turned out &quot;ok&quot;, implying that these rules were necessary in order for us to become &quot;ok&quot; adults. But what I see lacking in most that have turned out &quot;ok&quot; is joy, a sense of purpose and fascination with life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am so excited about the journey that we, as a family, are embarking on.

I think<br/>\nit&#39;s because they&#39;ve learned how to pay attention to details in their<br/>\nenvironment and respond accordingly (they found other skills more<br/>\nvaluable in traditional school).  How do they learn to respond?  Lot&#39;s<br/>\nof it is experience - trial and error.  Lots of watching others (what<br/>\nworks, what doesn&#39;t).  Lots of advice.  They know their father and I<br/>\nhave nothing to gain by convincing them to do something.   Our advice is<br/>\njust that - advice.<br/>\nFor the record, I have a 12 yo who routinely stays up until 2-4 every<br/>\nnight. He probably sleeps 10-12 hours.  Every once in a while there is<br/>\nsomething valuable for him in the morning and he jumps out of bed.  As<br/>\nhe gets older I expect his interests to change, and his sleeping habits<br/>\nto accommodate his needs as they mature. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":480712395,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;financialdebtsolutions@...&gt;","profile":"financialdebtsolutions","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Am I being neglectful?","postDate":"1332782747","msgId":66446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprcThxcis1dHBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGprbzIwZitrNzBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66439,"nextInTopic":66456,"prevInTime":66445,"nextInTime":66447,"topicId":66420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Talk about a reality check!!!

If you think she has some kind of fatigue problem, that&#39;s a little different - does she seem like she&#39;s lethargic? Does she have trouble focusing on things she finds interesting and important? You could offer her more vitamin D and maybe B vitamins if you&#39;re really worried and see if it helps, but it could be she needs a lot of rest right now. It could also be she&#39;s spending some of that time daydreaming - and that&#39;s really a good thing, especially if she went to a school which didn&#39;t encourage a lot of flights of fancy (Montessori schools have a bit of a reputation for zero tolerance of fantasy). It&#39;s normal for tweens and young teens to do a lot of daydreaming anyway, and if she&#39;s had a lack of fantasy in her life, she may be playing catch up!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I then remind her that this is fine for now, but she is practicing today for the adult she will become<br/>\n&gt; ***************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eeeeek! Go apologize and tell her You&#39;re still deschooling too and will take a lot longer than she will. That&#39;s a Horrible thing to tell another human being. She&#39;s not practicing anything, she&#39;s living her life and learning about herself and the world. Are you practicing to be an old lady?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Spend time with her. Bring food to where she is and eat with her there. Bring projects for yourself so you can hang out with her for a big chunk of time, if she&#39;s doing something uninteresting to you. Enjoy her company.

Come up with some ideas to spend more time together. Maybe you can stay up later or get up earlier! Maybe you can plan things to do in the evenings - lots of fun outings to be had after dark! That could help her get up and moving, too, if part of the problem is there&#39;s not much to do once the sun goes down.

It&#39;s not good to get too bogged down planning one&#39;s life instead of living it, and she&#39;s only 10. How can she possibly know what her life will look like at 20? That&#39;s a lifetime from now, in her terms.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could not have guessed what my life looks like now when I was 10. Never in a million years. I couldn&#39;t have guessed ten years ago what my life would be today. I&#39;ve had a lot of changes in my life! Settling down into one thing, career or life plan, hasn&#39;t really worked for me - life keeps throwing me curves!

I think that it<br/>\nis only common courtesy to let them know so that they aren&#39;t embarrassed<br/>\noutside of our home.  I still let them decide to bathe or not, though I<br/>\nonce had to ask my son (a couple of years back) to bathe because he was<br/>\nreally malodorous and we were going out.

At the moment, there is a great sense of<br/>\n&gt; peace at home. She is learning so much through the computer (she is<br/>\n&gt; fascinated by other cultures, geography, languages, music and animals), and<br/>\n&gt; we have such wonderful conversations. She is so happy. It is beautiful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I am concerned that she does not want to leave the house and only gets<br/>\n&gt; out of bed to join in our family meals. She only showers once or twice a<br/>\n&gt; week, but does so voluntarily. I do not pressure her as I am hoping this is<br/>\n&gt; just a stage. She goes to bed at 4am and sleeps until sometime between 2<br/>\n&gt; and 4pm. I set the bedtime (trying to honor the fact that she is a night<br/>\n&gt; owl), otherwise she would go to bed at 9 or 10 am. Every night she asks me<br/>\n&gt; if she can stay up all night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When her sleeping patterns come up in conversation she reminds me she is<br/>\n&gt; deschooling(I might have given her too much information, without having<br/>\n&gt; done enough research). I then remind her that this is fine for now, but she<br/>\n&gt; is practicing today for the adult she will become and that it is my<br/>\n&gt; responsibility to ensure her well being. I ask her what does she want her<br/>\n&gt; life to look like and she doesn&#39;t really care about much yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the moment, it is just the two of us and I am being extremely relaxed<br/>\n&gt; about it. We are leaving for NZ in one month and will be away 3 months, so<br/>\n&gt; I am taking it as if we are on vacations. But in NZ we will meet up with my<br/>\n&gt; partner, Lisa, and although she is educating herself on unschooling, she<br/>\n&gt; has expressed her disapproval.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My biggest concern is my daughter&#39;s growth and hygiene. Kids need sleep<br/>\n&gt; while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping 10-12 hours a day. Am I<br/>\n&gt; being neglectful?

Staying up all night must be pretty valuable, because you won&#39;t give it to her.  4:00 a.m. is practically all night anyway, so you&#39;re being arbitrary.

They are<br/>\nchronically sleep-deprived.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be (you could ask her!) that she wants the experience of staying<br/>\nup all night but once gaining it might not want to continue to sleep<br/>\nthrough periods of the most interesting events.  Or to have most of her<br/>\nwaking time during a period when you are sleeping. (Although I am not<br/>\npositive when you sleep or when you are available to her other than that<br/>\nyou do have wonderful conversations). I think it is a great skill to learn<br/>\nto determine when one should sleep in order to be awake for preferred<br/>\nactivities or friend availability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome adults ( I was one during a few different periods of my life) work<br/>\nevenings or &quot;graveyard&quot; shifts.   My experience was that doing so did<br/>\nindeed interfere with social life but in some cases in a positive way.<br/>\nWhen I had to go to work at 7 am I could not readily socialize with those<br/>\nwho went out until midnight!.   Graveyard shift meant that I could sleep in<br/>\nthe morning and early afternoon and then socialize in the dinner hour and<br/>\nafterward then off to work at 11 pm or midnight!.    It is not a valid<br/>\nconcern to say a certain sleep pattern is needed now to prepare for<br/>\nadulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill you be with your partner for only the 3 months in New Zealand?<br/>\nBusiness partner or life partner?

AND that she must not disturb the sleep of people who wish to sleep<br/>\nduring those hours.
