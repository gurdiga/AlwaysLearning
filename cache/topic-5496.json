I think &quot;days of sun&quot; are probably gauged by a certain number of hours per day of sunshine. ... does that make sense? And I think Colorado gets it&#39;s 300+ days a year of sunshine because we often get snow for an hour or two and then sun most of the rest of the day.  The desert states ARE much hotter than Co...no doubt that you are right about that.  But Colorado VERY seldom sees rain...so that probably balances things out... <br/>\nThe one thing we have to be careful of, though, is the UV factor...because of the high elevation, you really need to put sunscreen on the kids ALWAYS...even (especially) in the winter!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, March 13, 2002 9:47 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Colorado Springs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 3/13/02 9:39:40 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mtbunkey@...\">mtbunkey@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;  You might think twice about Colorado, though...I didn&#39;t make that up...it <br/>\n  IS the 2nd sunniest state.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never heard that, having lived in New Mexico so long and KNOWING it <br/>\n  rains and snows more in Colorado than here.

Got to help a fellow Brit:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway we used to live in CS 5 years ago. I really liked it weather, temps<br/>\nwise. The sky is usually blue and it&#39;s rarely grey and rainy (something you<br/>\nreally appreciate coming from UK).<br/>\nI did find the tone of the city was generally conservative. This may not be<br/>\na problem for you but at that time I could not find a hs group that was<br/>\nwelcoming of nonchristians (a couple did tolerate). I tried the UU church<br/>\nthere and liked some of the adult stuff but it was really pushy about<br/>\nseparating children during the services and since I had little ones who at<br/>\nthat time wouldn&#39;t separate we didn&#39;t go often. Alternative things were OK.<br/>\nReally nice and big &quot;health&quot; food store and restaurant. There were also<br/>\nsome pockets of people into alternative things. It just took awhile to find<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of fun things to do there and also Denver isn&#39;t far away as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\nIf you want land you are probably looking at Black Forest area or further<br/>\nout in the flat parts (area names???) There are huge housing areas that are<br/>\nrapidly being put up but of course they are packed in and all look the<br/>\nsame. Many companies transfered there from california so there are lots of<br/>\nCA transplants -- perhaps that has helped tone down the conservatism in the<br/>\nlast few years:)<br/>\n<br/>\nHS laws were really great. I used a narrative assessment from my mom (a<br/>\nspecial ed teacher in CA) and then I also gave annual assessments of other<br/>\nkids so they wouldn&#39;t have to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway hi, and I will introduce myself better soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:03 PM 3/13/02 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks to everyone who replied.
