Now and then, people stay up late, and you roll with it. Every night means it could be a good idea to change your own sleep schedule to make things easier on everyone. And in between there are other ideas and solutions. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor several years, Mo (now 10) had a pretty regular sleep routine and I could more or less predict when she&#39;d be going to bed... most of the time. Sometimes she&#39;d have a late night or three, and then back to normal. The thing was, now and then her whole cycle would shift by two hours - just like that. It would take me about a week to realize it was a shift, not just a few late nights, and then another week of feeling jet-lagged to catch up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think she&#39;s still like that to a degree, but nowadays it doesn&#39;t matter so much if I&#39;m up or not, since night-time is when she tends to get really deep into a project and doesn&#39;t want to be disturbed, anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen Sandra&#39;s sleep page?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280748421,"authorName":"Vanessa Orsborn","from":"Vanessa Orsborn &lt;orangeness1@...&gt;","profile":"orangeness1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Child awake at night","postDate":"1326561888","msgId":65023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBNTQ0QjlFLTQ2MUYtNEJCMi05NzIxLTE5OTY0NUMyRUVCRUB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3QzBCRDE3LUIwQjEtNDJCNi05MDNGLTYxQzlGQzQyNjFCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTUtYUHRTQjhNc1Z2WFJTamp2NEZEbkZLeUh1VzYtRDNkVzR4ZWk5MFY4TGp3bTAxUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEM3QzBCRDE3LUIwQjEtNDJCNi05MDNGLTYxQzlGQzQyNjFCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65022,"nextInTopic":65025,"prevInTime":65022,"nextInTime":65024,"topicId":65019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, My youngest does this once every couple of weeks or so.

That&#39;s too adversarial, too violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink instead of the principles involved.  People do need to sleep, at some point.  Children like to explore and learn; unschooling is about learning.  Peaceful parenting is about creating a peaceful, safe, happy environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t so much &quot;choose to be awake&quot; as they ARE awake.  <br/>\nIf a child is awake, someone needs to be awake to take care of him.  Either find ways to comfort your child to sleep, or find someone else to be awake so you can sleep, or wake up and watch him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes if I was sick or really tired, I would set up videos and toys and a floor bed for my oldest, and lie down on the couch in that room, trying to stay awake.  It wasn&#39;t always the safest thing, but I told him if he needed me I was right here--that was permission to wake me up. It only happened three or fourtimes.  If that had been combined with a child who wanted to run, or who had been told &quot;no, don&#39;t touch that&quot; a lot about things in the house, it could have been a time for him to sneak around and do things that wouldn&#39;t have been done if I were awake.  But we had said yes a lot, and he was comfortable in the house, without secret desires or curiosities or desperation to FINALLY see or do or try or touch something, so he was most likely going to stay there near me, watch the show, and play with the toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if something had happened and he had been hurt it would have been fully my fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to that isn&#39;t to threaten a child to GO TO SLEEP.  The answer is to find ways to be awake when the child is as patiently and as lovingly as you can.  It will pay off in the long run (and the short run, too).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":502477525,"authorName":"bellumswife77","from":"&quot;bellumswife77&quot; &lt;stefanie@...&gt;","profile":"bellumswife77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Child awake at night","postDate":"1326548007","msgId":65022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGplczA3NytoOWVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCRkJBMjQ3LTlGQTctNEUxNi1CQzg3LTRCOEY3Nzc5RTIyNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":65021,"nextInTopic":65023,"prevInTime":65021,"nextInTime":65023,"topicId":65019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
