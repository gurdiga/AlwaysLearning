Well, duh, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nAaron is starting to read.  And yesterday he was looking at his candy<br/>\nwrapper where it said, &quot;4 to go&quot; and he read it fine and then asked<br/>\nwhat they meant by that.  His sister explained it meant there were 4<br/>\ncandy bars in the package.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I thought about it, I realized it doesn&#39;t really follow any phonics<br/>\nrules, but he had no trouble with &quot;to&quot; and &quot;go&quot; sounding totally<br/>\ndifferent, and maybe that is because we *haven&#39;t* drilled any phonics<br/>\nrules at him, so he has no preconceived hang ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also read several candy hearts that his Granny had in a bowl on her<br/>\ncoffee table.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24205,"nextTopicId":24206}}
