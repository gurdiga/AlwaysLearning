Does she have<br/>\na realistic idea of what the competition for these low paying jobs is<br/>\nlikely to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the major statewide budget cuts in education, almost no students<br/>\ncompleting their credentials this year will be hired.  Next year, when<br/>\nshe finishes her credential, she will be competing for jobs against many<br/>\nof them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMajoring in basketweaving would probably be more practical. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66835036,"authorName":"rjhill241@aol.com","from":"rjhill241@...","profile":"rjhill241","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When family disagrees /OT","postDate":"1050001461","msgId":13449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzLjJhYTIwNTYxLjJiYzcxYTM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13447,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":13448,"nextInTime":13450,"topicId":13447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/10/03 11:51:04 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

We <br/>\nhave talked about the issue of being prepared for something else though <br/>\nbecause of the budget cuts in our state. Most of our family works within <br/>\nschool districts and they have been keeping her updated as much as possible. <br/>\nIt&#39;s funny though, they are very  supportive of my choice though. True enough <br/>\nI have never mentioned &quot;Unshcooling&quot; but who cares, they see my kids for who <br/>\nthey are and know better than to drill them. Probably because of all the true <br/>\ncrap they know goes on in the Public System, I obviously couldn&#39;t do any <br/>\nworse.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13372,"nextTopicId":13298}}
