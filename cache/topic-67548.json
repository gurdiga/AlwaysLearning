You can upload drawings from a program like Paint as easily as photos to a blog. Or sound files. Can you take short videos on your camera? That could be fun on a blog - even just your daughter saying something in front of some interesting scene or find. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who has mastered the art of self-photography - he takes snapshots of himself as a kind of photo journal. It&#39;s amazing how much more interesting it is to look at pictures with a familiar face in them - even Walmarts are more interesting when you know the person standing in front of one. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"shirarocklin","from":"&quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Blogging for kids","postDate":"1339106842","msgId":67548,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpxcjhtcSs3bTZ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67561,"prevInTime":67547,"nextInTime":67549,"topicId":67548,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We re taking a very long trip over the next few months.

My six year old expressed the desire to keep a blog for her friends tomsee what she&#39;s doing while we are gone.  I know how to use blogger.  Are there any blogging options for kids? Apps to post from that are kid oriented? Specifically for non-readers?  Ill write for her, or set up a program that writes as she dictates, and show her how to uploAd photos she takes, etc.  but a program or app that gives her more independance my be fun for her too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67636,"nextTopicId":67628}}
