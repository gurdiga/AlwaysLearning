He said he would work on it <br/>\nwith her. I said she wouldn&#39;t like it if he made her and what would he <br/>\ntell the other dd&#39;s? They would want to be with him, too. He let it <br/>\ndrop. But it made me mad. I know all he sees is them watching tv and <br/>\nmovies all the time. I see this: they can remember actors and what <br/>\nmovies they have been in or done voice-overs for, especially Tom Hanks. <br/>\nThere&#39;s this one obscure character in The Fifth Element that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nremember what else he&#39;d been in, but Aislinn knew he was from Something <br/>\nAbout Mary. It might not be stuff out of a curriculum book, but I&#39;m <br/>\nimpressed. Two weeks ago Aislinn made up a game. It&#39;s sort of an I-spy <br/>\nwith words. Each person must find a written word in the room and spell <br/>\nit, then the others must find the word. Even Soleille (3) was playing <br/>\nbut with her own special rules. Right now Aislinn is playing a Reader <br/>\nRabbit game with Soleille on her lap, teaching her letters and numbers <br/>\nwhile Elysia (5) has Leiren (15m) on the dining room table teaching her <br/>\nhow to scribble with crayons. People who think these children can&#39;t <br/>\nlearn without it being forced have never really watched them...never let <br/>\nthem alone to do what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh is worried about Aislinn not knowing how to read. Aislinn is <br/>\nworried about it, too, because she sees Hooked-On-Phonics commercials <br/>\nthat show parents so upset about their kids not reading. I told her to <br/>\nrelax. That she&#39;s learning to read every day, a little at a time. I told <br/>\nher breaking a code can be like that. It can be a struggle or it can be <br/>\neasy if you just keep yourself open to it and let it flow. She&#39;s still <br/>\nworrying over it. But then again, she&#39;s a worrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, she&#39;s built herself a house on top of our refrigerator. <br/>\nElysia&#39;s is on top of the piano. Soleille goes between the two as a <br/>\nhouseguest. You&#39;re all welcome, too, if your not afraid of heights!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, things are going great. Dh and others will see it <br/>\neventually. How could they not. Have a great day, everyone. Heidi Case</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18929,"nextTopicId":18968}}
