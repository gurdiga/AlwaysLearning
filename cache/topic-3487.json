And Mary&#39;s humorous <br/>\npost....that&#39;s hilarious.<br/>\nI am picturing speaking with a Southern Baptist Fundi and saying &quot;Geez, I&#39;m <br/>\nsuch a slut&quot; and what their face would do!!! Oh...too funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nAri,<br/>\nWe&#39;ve all been through the tv debate so much, I think some of us would prefer <br/>\nto discuss anything else!! Well, not totally. I don&#39;t mind if people are <br/>\nreally interested in understanding the letting children choose issue, but to <br/>\ncome here and post any anti tv arguements is a moot point. We&#39;ve all BTDT. We <br/>\nhave chosen a different path and are happy with that choice. If you want to <br/>\nunderstand why, I think you&#39;ll get a lot of great answers. If you want to try <br/>\nand convince anyone differently with anti-tv information, you are really just <br/>\nwasting your energy, YK?<br/>\nDiscussing is great. Debating an issue that (I think) most of the people here <br/>\nhave already dealt with is different.<br/>\nOr maybe I&#39;m putting words into people&#39;s mouths....don&#39;t want to do that. <br/>\nJust giving you my view on the whole topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for my rant,<br/>\nI have a friend that I really do enjoy for the most part. But we met under <br/>\nthe guise of her being an unschooler..which is not the case.<br/>\nI am wondering if that is why some of the things she says just really bug <br/>\nme!! I seem able to let go when another friend has opposing view points, but <br/>\nit&#39;s harder with her.<br/>\nShe did tell me she&#39;s not an unschooler at one point, so I should understand <br/>\nthat we won&#39;t agree...but it just rankles me!!<br/>\nTopics like spanking, letting children choose etc... are hot buttons to be <br/>\navoided. We don&#39;t agree at all.<br/>\nAs we parted company today, her kids were begging to come over to our house. <br/>\nI had said &quot;sure, great&quot; when mine invited hers over.<br/>\nBut she was bent on going home because they all had vitamins to take? They <br/>\nhave a special diet and we didn&#39;t have proper food for them (no, it has <br/>\nnothing to do with allergies, just a control issue). Then they asked if they <br/>\ncould come AFTER lunch and her answer was that they &quot;needed&quot; to be outdoors <br/>\n..&quot;whether  they liked it or not&quot;<br/>\nWhen they voiced their dissent (they really, really wanted to be with my <br/>\nkids) she replied &quot;this is not a democracy, it&#39;s a dictatorship&quot; end of <br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\nI feel so sad for those kids.<br/>\nTo feel powerless to even choose who you hang out with or what you do....ugh.<br/>\nShe feels she is making these choices for their health.<br/>\nWhat about their emotional health? Does this not even enter these parent&#39;s <br/>\nheads? It&#39;s not just about WHAT you eat, or WHAT you do.....it&#39;s about being <br/>\na whole person. Able to choose your own path. Emotional health is more <br/>\nimportant to me.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3622,"nextTopicId":3316}}
