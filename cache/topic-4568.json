I still have<br/>\na very hard with sweets,,,and my weight keeps going up and up <br/>\nand up.  I hate it,,,but it&#39;s either I eliminate sweets all together or<br/>\nI can&#39;t control myself,,,,I will eat and eat until it&#39;s gone.  One day<br/>\nabout a year ago, I made a huge batch of cookies,,,,,72 cookies <br/>\nin all.  I ate them all in a three day period.  Ugh,,,,<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, we have had to cut out all the sugar and gluten, out<br/>\nof necessity,,,,my husband has diabetes and a gluten intolerance<br/>\nthat directly affects his diabetes.  If he eats anything at all with<br/>\ngluten, his blood sugar goes WAY up.  My father (his doctor)<br/>\ntold me recently that my kids are probably very suseptible to getting<br/>\njuvenile diabetes because it&#39;s running in their genes on both sides<br/>\nof the family (I don&#39;t have it though).  He recommended eliminating<br/>\nthe sugar and gluten for them too (he said it&#39;s healthier that way <br/>\nanyway).  We have done pretty well in doing that, but I will still let <br/>\nthem eat whatever they want at birthday parties, special occasions <br/>\nand on Halloween.  Both kids have also inherited my dairy intolerance <br/>\n(it causes horribly painful IBS for both of them),,,so we use soy milk, <br/>\nrice milk, or oat milk whenever something calls for cow&#39;s milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t want food to be an issue, but in our case, it just is.<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve done is buy lots of stuff we all *can* eat and stocked the <br/>\nkitchen with that.  That way, they can eat anything they want that&#39;s <br/>\nin the house, whenever they want. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea Kim :-)<br/>\nMommy to two sweeties!<br/>\nLaura (2/16/96) & Allison (8/31/99)<br/>\nKent, WA,,,,,,,,soon to be Seattle!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4475,"nextTopicId":4571}}
