But there are uniformed personnel, with guards’ unforms or with bright-colored safety vests, and kids can find them easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPracticing with kids to say the parent’s names instead of “mom and dad” is helpful and it can be done in fun, funny ways.  We used to play “what’s my name” with toddlers for that purpose, and for fun.  The first time Kirby said his dad’s name he said “Teef Doonvald.”   It was for “Keith / Gunwaldt.”  We were somewhere with friends from the SCA and in a normal (not-medieval-event) setting, it’s fairly common for people to refer to the others as “Jeff/Artan” or such so that if the hearers know them by only one name or the other they’re still identifiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo “Doonvald” wouldn’t have been very helpful and it was good for him to say “Keith Dodd” and “Sandra Dodd” well enough that others could understand him, but the one time he did get lost, they announced that a little boy was lost and his name was….  Tirby?”  So I thought having their names and ours, and phone numbers, on cloth, was a good idea after that. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":343381924,"authorName":"lucy.web","from":"&quot;lucy.web&quot; &lt;lucy.web@...&gt;","profile":"lucylists","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: How and/or why to discuss terrorism","postDate":"1450291503","msgId":76473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5NDExQTMwLTVBN0QtNDJDMC05MkFFLUIwRTFGMkZEMzYxOUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVFRUE4QkVELTk4Q0ItNDA5QS05MTg4LUFDMEU0OUM5RDlBOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDk3NTI3ODVGLTkxQzctNEZGNi1CMDU3LTk4RThGQTlDREE2QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDxFRUVBOEJFRC05OENCLTQwOUEtOTE4OC1BQzBFNDlDOUQ5QTlAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76472,"nextInTopic":76474,"prevInTime":76472,"nextInTime":76474,"topicId":76447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve also read that it s better to tell your children to find a woman with kids rather than someone in a uniform because security guards and bouncers, etc,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\"><html><head></head><div>I&#39;ve also read that it&#39;s better to tell your children to find a woman with kids rather than someone in a uniform because security guards and bouncers, etc, sometimes wear uniforms and recruitment for those professions may not necessarily include doing background checks or be particularly reliable.</div><div><br></div><div>I found the book &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; informative and useful, a little scary too, but with lots of practical info that can help reassure a parent that their child is equipped to know what to do if they get into one of the scary situations. &nbsp;So ultimately a reassuring read rather than a scary one.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the other things I remember clearly from that book is to advise your child to approach someone (preferably a woman or couple with children) before someone has the chance to notice they are looking lost and can approach them. &nbsp;Someone your child proactively chooses is highly unlikely to be a predator. &nbsp;Someone who chooses to go up to you child might be a predator who has seen an opportunity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also that it&#39;s important not to over-emphasise the idea of &#39;stranger danger&#39; because you don&#39;t want your child to be too scared to ask for help. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Lucy<br><br><br></div><div><br><div><br><br>Sent from my iPad</div>On 16 Dec 2015, at 18:54, Ann Hedly Rousseau <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:annhedly@...\">annhedly@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></div><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\"><div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n<span style=\"display:none;\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><blockquote type=\"cite\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069ygrp-mlmsg\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\" style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069ygrp-msg\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069ygrp-text\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 1em;\">We talked about finding a person in a uniform if she ever gets lost</p></div></div></div></blockquote><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069Apple-interchange-newline\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2138380069\">We’ve told our kids to find a mom with kids if they ever get lost and can’t find us.

(We went to the Statue of Liberty last year and none of my children asked about anything.) At first he was making jokes and even said, &quot;Do they think someone might blow up the Statue of Liberty!&quot; He thought this sounded so ridiculous and absurd. His 10 year old friend started talking to him about terrorism. At that point he asked, &quot;What is a terrorist?&quot; I pulled him aside at that point and had a quick talk.  We had a longer talk later at home without my younger children. </div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure exactly when the right time is to tell children about horrible things that are going on in the world. I was not prepared for the questions when they came up. I think you should try to gauge your children&#39;s possible concern or interest. Maybe it is just best to think about and prepare yourself for a conversation about terrorism if your children ask or experience things that bring up the topic. </div><div><br></div><div>I think it is important to make sure children are aware of their surroundings. My kids always ask me questions when they see something that appears unusual. I always tell them when we are in large crowds to stay close so I won&#39;t lose them. It has gotten to be a joke at this point. I also tell them that most people in the world are nice, but some people are not so they should never go away with a person they don&#39;t know. These are very general and if you are just generally concerned about safety they might work. </div><div><br></div><div>Hope</div><br><div><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tuesday, December 15, 2015, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

We talked about peace and joy and love and all the wonderful people who help when bad things happen. We talked about the doctor in the attacks who did CPR on one of the terrorists. We talked about gratitude for our lives and our relative safety. We talked about refugees and how they manage to maintain hope against all odds.

We live in an area with lots of Muslims, woman in hijabs, and we&#39;ve seen full birkas from time to time. There are also many Arabs who may be culturally Muslim, but not practicing. My point is that the kids know not all Muslims are bad people. </div><div><br></div><div>I am not sure whether or not we should talk about the attacks. We are leaving for a flight followed by a cruise next week and I would like to prep everyone in case something did happen. Is that a bad idea? I don&#39;t want to unnecessarily frighten our children. And they are all different ages, so I&#39;m not sure which approach would be best for all. I&#39;m really curious what principle of radical unschooling would apply to this situation. Thank you.</div><div><br></div><div>Megan<span></span></div><br><br>-- <br>Sent from Gmail Mobile<br></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76267,"nextTopicId":76446}}
