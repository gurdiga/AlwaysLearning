Keith will be in Wyoming at an SCA <br/>\nevent with a male friend.  Marty will be three hours south at Elephant Butte <br/>\nLake with his friend Logan&#39;s extended family.  Kirby is going with Carol <br/>\nRice&#39;s family (famous here from the really-late reading article at <br/>\nwww.unschooling.com) to watch the fireworks at Kirtland Air Force Base, and <br/>\nHolly had a choice of two plans and is going to go with Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, I&#39;ll stay here and comfort the dog and make a webpage for my friend <br/>\nRamona King whose husband and three kids are away in North Carolina.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is a big Anglophile.
