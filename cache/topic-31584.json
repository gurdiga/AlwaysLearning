He must be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Frank Lloyd Wright died, TV was less than ten years old,  <br/>\nreally.  He was in Arizona.  They hadn&#39;t had TV until early 50&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Lloyd Wright was an architect.  He was an engineer and an  <br/>\nartist.  He wasn&#39;t a good husband or a good father.  He probably  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t spend much time watching TV, in his late 80&#39;s, when TV  <br/>\nbroadcast was first broad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, right.  He was born in 1867.  Horse and buggy days, totally.   <br/>\nTrains.  Pre-radio, pre-automobile, way pre-airplane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these anti-TV people are making a supremely odd move by quoting  <br/>\nhim about TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this reminds me, too, to mention that John Holt wasn&#39;t keen on  <br/>\nTV.  He was also fairly old when TV came along, and he was  <br/>\nchildless.  He wasn&#39;t a bad father, because he wasn&#39;t a father at  <br/>\nall, which is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen John Holt visited families, they had company and so probably  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the TV on.  When he was  home, he did a ton of reading  <br/>\nand writing.  I don&#39;t criticize that, because it&#39;s most of what I do  <br/>\nwith my own days.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt easily retracted his statement and belief that cursive was  <br/>\nfaster than printing when some kids raced him and beat him.  He quit  <br/>\njustifying cursive writing as being necessarily faster after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf John Holt were here now, he&#39;d have changed his mind about TV,  <br/>\nbecause what he cared about was learning.   Many of us have children  <br/>\nwho have clearly and repeatedly demonstrated a TON of learning from  <br/>\nTV, video at home, video online, etc. He would see that and be  <br/>\nchanged, because he was learning all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31581,"nextTopicId":31569}}
