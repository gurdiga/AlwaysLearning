I think that most of <br/>\nCameron&#39;s friends in school are horribly sleep-deprived! They&#39;re up no later <br/>\nthan 6:30. If they have no afterschool activities, they&#39;re home around <br/>\n4-4:30; with sports/band/drama/whatever it may be 6-7pm. Homework takes 3-4 <br/>\nhours. Then there&#39;s supper. Their natural urge to stay up late kicks in about <br/>\n11 or so---and then it&#39;s up again at 6! How can they be expected to function? <br/>\nMost adults don&#39;t have that kind of schedule!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re not known for their excellent eating habits at school (besides, who <br/>\ncan eat AND socialize in 20 minutes?). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far we haven&#39;t had the troubles we&#39;ve seen in his schooled friends&#39; <br/>\nfamilies (although that&#39;s hard to judge, because even when Cam was in school, <br/>\nlife here didn&#39;t seem that bad to him). I think if you have what it takes to <br/>\nunschool ANYWAY, the other things won&#39;t seem as insurmountable! The lifestyle <br/>\njust lends itself to understanding and being willing to back off when you <br/>\nneed to (and you don&#39;t HAVE to yell that he knew about that project two weeks <br/>\nago so why didn&#39;t he get started THEN!). It just makes gentler parenting an <br/>\neasier option!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m right in your boat. Cameron turns 14 in 4 weeks.
