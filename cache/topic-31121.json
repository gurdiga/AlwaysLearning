LingoZ is an online community building the world&#39;s  <br/>\nlargest dictionary where you may look up more than 4,500,000 terms,  <br/>\nvote for definitions, post comments or add your own terms,  <br/>\ndefinitions and glossaries. On LingoZ you can meet people from all  <br/>\nover the globe interested in translation and language. (It is  <br/>\nsomewhat like UrbanDictionary.com, but less slang related.)<br/>\n==================<br/>\nIt&#39;s still building, so there will be other languages to come.  Right  <br/>\nnow it has German, English, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Dutch  <br/>\nand Portuguese.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31120,"nextTopicId":31123}}
