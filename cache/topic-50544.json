I could be wrong,  <br/>\nor might have &quot;discovered&quot; something others of you have known a long  <br/>\ntime, but I think maybe people have their &quot;if/then&quot; expectations  <br/>\nbackwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIF someone wanted to unschool and IF Pam or Joyce or I (or fill in  <br/>\nyour own sample person) said &quot;you can if&quot; THEN that might be bossy, I  <br/>\nsuppose, in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both those cases above, though, it wasn&#39;t &quot;if you want to unschool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf was IF you want to be welcome in this discussion THEN you need to  <br/>\nbe talking about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Pam is bossy (funny idea, because she&#39;s hardly ever anything *like*  <br/>\nbossy), she&#39;s not telling people what they have to do or how they have  <br/>\nto be at home with their kids.  She&#39;s talking about how people need to  <br/>\nbe in order for her to let their posts through to the list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m bossy in my house, it&#39;s because it&#39;s my house and I get to say  <br/>\nwhether people throw bottles or smoke cigarettes or set fire to paper  <br/>\nnapkins at the table.  I do!  It doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t break glass or  <br/>\nset fire to your own table cloth with your own cigarettes at your own  <br/>\nhouse; I don&#39;t care.  But IF someone asks online how to keep broken  <br/>\nglass and the smell of smoke out of their house, I might make some  <br/>\nrecommendations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not unschooling on this list.  We&#39;re discussing unschooling.<br/>\nIf someone wants to just play around with unschooling in her spare  <br/>\ntime, once in a while, that&#39;s not the topic of this list.<br/>\nThis list is for people who really do intend to discuss and consider  <br/>\nunschooling in a serious, focussed manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50506,"nextTopicId":50475}}
