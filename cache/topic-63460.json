Probably better than many kids his age in school.<br/>\nI have friends that are very relaxed homeschoolers that still make their kids write a paragraph a day. <br/>\nI know my son writes and reads a lot on his own terms. He does a lot of research on his games reading online forums, watching and reading comments on YouTube, reading guides and sites.<br/>\nIt is all because of his passion for video gaming.<br/>\nHere it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom: Marvin Polikowsky &lt;@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polykow@...\">polykow@...</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: Blockland Key Recovery<br/>\nDate: Mon, 17 Oct 2011 20:27:43 -0500<br/>\n<br/>\nName:ClassifedAge:Classifed<br/>\nCharacter Name:Jack<br/>\nCharacter Age: 25<br/>\nCharacter Gender:Male<br/>\nCharacter Faction:Frya<br/>\nCharacter Story:Jack was born inside a mansion and loved to<br/>\ngo into the mine to get gold.He would kill anyone it looked<br/>\nlike he was able to handle with a bow N arrow and a silver<br/>\nsword.He lived the job of a merchant selling ores and<br/>\ningots.While mining once he saw goblins .With a silver bow<br/>\ngolden armor and a phaseblade he ran to his house.While<br/>\nrunning he saw the goblins going towards his father.He just<br/>\nran to the house.Once there he guarded the doors.When a<br/>\ngoblin theif ran up behind him his arm was broken and he<br/>\nmade it to the basement hidden in the hallway behind a<br/>\npicture.Once there he found his mother already there.His<br/>\nmother told him about his frya bloodline and where frya<br/>\nis.Jack was looted by a goblin theif when he left the safe<br/>\nroom .Left only with copper tools he made it to frya.He was<br/>\ncarefull because the people of frya did not trust him.He saw<br/>\na windian spy and killed him.The frya army saw a campfire<br/>\none of them went to the campfire.To see jack had killed the<br/>\nspy.He lived in frya as a citzen .W hen 20 he did 4 years of<br/>\ntraining in swordsman ship and the bow and arrow .When 25 he<br/>\nfought his first battle in a huge war.Gameplay starts<br/>\nhere.Also he hates goblins.Hope you liked it and the story<br/>\ntells he uses swords as a main weapon Vampire Paladin rawr  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Notice his spelling is really good for a 9 year old.
