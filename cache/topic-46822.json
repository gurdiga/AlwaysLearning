My<br/>\nhusband could potentially buy a new car tomorrow.  He has the freedom to<br/>\ndo so and his own free will to make that decision.  I know he will not<br/>\nmake decisions like that without thinking first about how it affects<br/>\neveryone else and talking to me about it.  Some kids are really<br/>\nresponsible with their choices and some need help with making any<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s about drawing lines, it&#39;s more about presenting a<br/>\npath of choices and accepting the chosen path and then helping the child<br/>\nalong it.  When a child wakes up in the morning, they are immediately<br/>\npresented with choices, do I stay in bed, do I stay in bed and watch tv,<br/>\ndo I get up and go to the bathroom, do I stay up, do I then get dressed,<br/>\ndo I stay in my pj&#39;s, do I go get some breakfast, do I ask someone to<br/>\nget me breakfast, do I sit on the couch or the floor or at the kitchen<br/>\ntable?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids get up at 7 am sharp and get dressed with a parent chosen<br/>\noutfit, go directly to the breakfast table and then off to summer camp<br/>\nafter they&#39;ve brushed their teeth and their hair and put on the<br/>\nappropriate parent chosen shoes.  If you aren&#39;t doing that, then you,<br/>\nthe parent, have chosen to give your child some freedom in which they<br/>\ncan use their free will to live in.   If the parent still believes that<br/>\ncomfort and food are a good thing, they&#39;ll find a way to present some<br/>\ncomfort and food as really desirable options to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, Margaux was getting ready to go out with me to the store.<br/>\nIt was chilly in the house, but I knew that it was already in the upper<br/>\n80 degrees outside and so I let her know and suggested that she pick<br/>\nshorts and short sleeves and put on a sweater.  She refused to do so. <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t worth arguing about or making a big deal about.  I&#39;d given her<br/>\nthe information she needed to know and helped her put on her long pants<br/>\nand long sleeved shirt.  We left and she was hot, I helped her roll up<br/>\nher pant legs and long sleeves, and she was comfortable in the stores<br/>\nwith air conditioning.  As soon as we got home, she changed her<br/>\nclothing.  It would have been nice if she hadn&#39;t beem hot and irritated,<br/>\nbut that small amount of hot and irritation was small compared to how<br/>\nshe would&#39;ve reacted to me forcing her to wear something that she didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had been going to the playground to play for many hours, there are<br/>\nmany things that I would&#39;ve done to make things go well for Margaux and<br/>\nher clothing choice.  That, I suppose would be the frame work.  I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve packed alternate clothing and cool drinks and food and a park<br/>\nwith shade.  I want her to be able to choose what she wants to wear, to<br/>\nmake those kinds of decisions for herself, but since I also value<br/>\ncomfort, I&#39;ll make sure that those are options too.  I don&#39;t have to do<br/>\nthat though, I could go and let her suffer through her choice.  Just<br/>\nlike I could let her be mean to other children on the playground without<br/>\njumping in and smoothing things out.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: freedom and free will","postDate":"1250645381","msgId":46830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwODE4MTgyOWkyZjJlOGViY3FlZjZhZWUyYzlkMzAyNjUxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg2ZXRxNCtsOTE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg2YzkxMStjMXAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aDZldHE0K2w5MTVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46829,"nextInTopic":46839,"prevInTime":46829,"nextInTime":46831,"topicId":46822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ended up in a free for all, to everyone s detriment.

Since people have been talking about this idea<br/>\nrecently here, I thought I&#39;d put out there what Chamille said.  It was<br/>\nvery simple and concise, she said that parents can&#39;t give their children<br/>\nfreedom, but they could give them free will.  I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nphrased in that way, but with that general meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since she said it, turning it around in<br/>\nmy head over and over.  It&#39;s definitely related to freedom, but free<br/>\nwill involves choices of what one does with the freedom they have.  <br/>\nUpon looking up &quot;free will&quot; in wikipedia, you can see how philosophers<br/>\nhave hashed this idea out over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told someone once that her choice to force church on her daughter<br/>\nwasn&#39;t extending the &quot;free will&quot; that God gave her, to her daughter. <br/>\nThe very fact that kids aren&#39;t seen as people is glaring wether or not<br/>\nyou believe in God or going to church.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unschooling parent can allow their children free will, and children<br/>\ncan run with it making both good and bad choices and learning from each<br/>\nand every one of them.  And an unschooling parent can create a framework<br/>\nin which free will can be a part of life without making it a free for<br/>\nall, as in, do whatever you want, I don&#39;t care because you have the<br/>\nfreedom to do so.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46758,"nextTopicId":46831}}
