Each person is always working towards their own best, not competing or comparing. I cannot overemphasize how wonderful it has been to watch Wallace go from saying, &quot;I&#39;m not an athlete and I&#39;m the worst player on the team&quot; to being invited to train for the demonstration team in less than two years.Â </div><div><br></div><div>If she wants to get exercise because it sounds appealing, a program like this could be a great fit.
