It&#39;s a great party<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the annual Crawdad Festival (a Northern California homeschooling<br/>\nparty that goes for a whole weekend in September), I stayed up<br/>\nwith the teenagers and played until the wee hours of the morning.<br/>\nI told the other adults that I was the chaperone, but I turned<br/>\ninto a teenager as soon as they left the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling teenagers are so much fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bean Game is really called Bohnanza and is put out by Rio<br/>\nGrande.  You&#39;re a bean farmer planting and harvesting beans.<br/>\nThe bean cards make me smile.  It&#39;s a good game to play while<br/>\nyou&#39;re chatting with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;When we first started, I&#39;d feel hurt if my kids rejected my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;offerings.  It&#39;s much easier now to offer them things with no<br/>\n&gt; &gt;strings attached.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How did you work through that one, because it&#39;s still a problem for <br/>\n&gt;me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  How did I?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did was to just leave things around casually instead<br/>\nof offering them directly.  Thus, if the kids didn&#39;t pick them<br/>\nup, I could tell myself they hadn&#39;t noticed them instead of<br/>\ntaking it personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have Negative First Reaction kids, so they rejected things<br/>\na lot.  This gave me a lot of practice in breathing through<br/>\nrejection.  Often they would later pick up whatever it was,<br/>\nbut not until after they&#39;d insisted that it was something they&#39;d<br/>\nnever be interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;d try to look at things analytically.  Often, the kids<br/>\nwere right.  I was offering them something stupid, or I was<br/>\noffering it to them at a bad time, or in some other way blowing<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got better at offering in a sensitive way, without pushing.<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t like pushing at all.  They&#39;ll push back almost<br/>\nevery single time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, y&#39;know, it&#39;s no big deal if they reject one of my ideas.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just a thing.  It&#39;s better to do things that everyone <br/>\nenjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings do tend to come around on the guitar, if I wait long<br/>\nenough.  Every fall, I&#39;ve said that I&#39;d enjoy Family Nature<br/>\nWalks and our local Homeschooling Choir.  Every year, the kids<br/>\nwould tell me that they&#39;d hate those activities, so we didn&#39;t do<br/>\nthem.  This year, the kids said that, yes, those sounded like <br/>\ngreat activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also probably helps that there are four of them.  If I <br/>\noffer something, chances are that at least one of them will<br/>\ntake me up on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather Madrone &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heather@...\">heather@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.madrone.com\">http://www.madrone.com</a><br/>\nHomeschooling:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.madrone.com/Home-ed/homeschool.htm\">http://www.madrone.com/Home-ed/homeschool.htm</a><br/>\nThe Home-Ed List:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.madrone.com/Home-ed/helist.html\">http://www.madrone.com/Home-ed/helist.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can lead a child to learning, but you can&#39;t make her think.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4123,"nextTopicId":3774}}
