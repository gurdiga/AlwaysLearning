I have no idea where that tradition came from, but we loved it <br/>\nas kids.  Though we had a mother that made complete dinners every <br/>\nnight, that we had to eat.  So knowing we were having pancakes was a <br/>\nreal treat to us.<br/>\nMy kids wouldn&#39;t be happy with pancakes for dinner as something <br/>\nspecial.  We have pancakes, or anything else we want, whenever we <br/>\nwant it around here.<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to come up with something different, now that my mom let <br/>\nCarly know that we are suppose to DO something for Groundhogs day.<br/>\nActually I&#39;ll let the kids decide.  They usually have much better <br/>\nideas than I do.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ground Hog&#39;s Day","postDate":"1075752755","msgId":18662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5LjQyOTI5NDhhLjJkNTAwOTMzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18664,"prevInTime":18661,"nextInTime":18663,"topicId":18662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/31/04 7:09:45 AM, wifetovegman2002@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-261353914\">In a message dated 1/31/04 7:09:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wifetovegman2002@...\">wifetovegman2002@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; How *do* we celebrate it?
