I am also open if anyone has suggestions on math concepts ***<br/>\n <br/>\nAll around us kids are feeling pressured to read and read now, read sooner, better.  There are dozens of programs to help force this idea on children.  Special aids are hired by schools to get kids reading sooner.  Volunteers are put to task to read with kids.  All this spinning of wheels for something that will happen if given the time and space to do so.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf there is any way to buffer that for your kids, do it.  I know it&#39;s hard, my oldest struggled with seeing her friends reading and not being able to do so.  There were some things that helped.  We listened to a LOT of books on tape and cd, so book for book, she&#39;d &quot;read&quot; more than all of her school aged peers.  She could easily talk about these stories with friends that had read them too.  It also helped her build up her vocabulary base so that when she was finally reading, those words weren&#39;t new to her.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere were many things that helped her build her word collection.  She played ToonTown a lot.  That was significant in helping her learn to read.  There is a chat function in TT that allows players to talk to each other, she had to use it to interact with other players, so she figured out what those chat things said.  Video games in general played a huge part in word gathering and word recognition.  Through video games, and Pokemon, she became interested in anime and manga.  The very first book that she read all the way through, was manga.  She did that when she was 11ish.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen she looks back on her time of not being able to read, she says that she did feel like she should be reading, but that she put it aside with other things she wasn&#39;t able to do yet.  She feels wholeheartedly that she owns her reading experience, it&#39;s something she did, in her own brain.  She wishes all kids could experience that ownership of learning something complex and important.<br/>\n <br/>\nMath, like reading is all around us.  Chamille, my oldest again, never was a big numbers person, but she could always calculate money.  One day about a year or so ago, she&#39;s 15 now, we were at the store and I was trying to decide which was the better buy on some cheese, should I buy the larger amount or the smaller amount?  She picked up the smaller one and said, this is the better buy, you should get 2 of these instead of the big pack.  She&#39;d figured it out in her head somehow and quickly, quicker than me.  That&#39;s real math.  It happens, it really does.  Some kids, like my younger daughter, 8, are just naturally number and pattern oriented.  She&#39;s been doing numbers and patterns in her head for years.  She figured out how to count by 3&#39;s when she was about 4ish.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKids will pick things up through living.  If you think you aren&#39;t doing enough, do more, play more games, have more opportunities to explore and experience.  Don&#39;t think of it as teaching or finding teachable moments, think of it as experience gathering that adds more and more things to learn and draw from. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78881874,"authorName":"emiLy Q.","from":"&quot;emiLy Q.&quot; &lt;emilyjo@...&gt;","profile":"hanlone","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] reading","postDate":"1258537480","msgId":48693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM3MjkxRTI4LjY1NkY1JWVtaWx5am9AZW1pbHlqby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhkdW50bCtzMHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48670,"nextInTopic":48697,"prevInTime":48692,"nextInTime":48694,"topicId":17883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am reading lots and my oldest two(15 & 12) and I have been deschooling for nearly a year and a half. We sort of stumbled into unschoolng and have fallen in love with it. My children have never been in school however we were enrolled in charter schools which require the same type of work only done at home. They are finding some interests that are expanding their knowledge base. I do have questions about how to incorporate basic things like advanced math to their lives without it being a tedious learning chore, however that is not the reason for this post. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two smaller children (6 & 5) who recently came to me and asked me to teach them to read. I will honestly say I don&#39;t know how to do this in an unschooly way. I know that I can not TEACH them to read. I do do things with them that try to promote them learning. someone in the house reads to them daily, we all take turns with this and typically my husband does bedtime stories. Its their special time. I have been able to show my children that they already know many words. I just am not sure what to do to help them feel like they are learning at a pace that satisfies them. I did recently get the new scrabble card game and thought this would be fun as you change a word. It starts out with one word then you use the cards in your hand to change the word. I thought it sounded like loads of fun and could be modified to do 3 letter words that they already know. I just don&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo My question for this group would be what are some ways you have helped your little ones learn to read?

Normally I <br/>\nam really laid back and don&#39;t really care, it is really none of her <br/>\nbuisness.I have NEVER given her a reason to question any of my <br/>\nparenting abilities.However when i went this last time and she <br/>\nstarted questioning me i was caught off guard.And she also asked him <br/>\nwho his best friend was.This really pissed me off, after the fact, <br/>\nbecause I think she was trying to be sneaky with the &quot;socialization&quot; <br/>\nissue. But I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better response than what he <br/>\ngave her...&quot;My brother is my best friend&quot;. I had such an in your face <br/>\nfeeling...it was great.But then we had to go back on monday, 4 days <br/>\nlater, and she proceeded to say that she was really concerned which <br/>\nthrew me for another loop and we got into a discussion about <br/>\nschooling etc.Now I know she is a mandated reporter, so am I, I work <br/>\nwith abused kids in a residential facility, but I think I was more <br/>\nappalled to think that someone would question me.Not saying that i am <br/>\nperfect, far from it but really. plus she dosen&#39;t know me....wait <br/>\nthis sounds like i am justifying what she did.

As a dr. she <br/>\nis pretty good.But she did put a bug in my bonnet which then in turn <br/>\nstarted worrying me that she would call DCF and I really don&#39;t need <br/>\nthat aggrivation now.Normally I probably would have let this <br/>\nsituation just roll but with 3 kids at home, 6 months pregnant with <br/>\n#4 and a husband 2 weeks post-op with shoulder surgery #4 I think she <br/>\njust hit a nerve.I did get a copy of the K-8 curriculum guide for the <br/>\nstate of CT and I did look at it about 2 years ago but as I read it I <br/>\nrealized that my 8 yo was not up to thier &quot;standards&quot; in some areas, <br/>\nlike reading,but was well advanced in other areas like science and <br/>\ngeography...stuff he really enjoys. Of course I can think of all this <br/>\nstuff now.

He then proceedes to <br/>\ntell her for the umpteeenth time that he is homeschooled. Normally I <br/>\nam really laid back and don&#39;t really care, it is really none of her <br/>\nbuisness.I have NEVER given her a reason to question any of my <br/>\nparenting abilities.However when i went this last time and she <br/>\nstarted questioning me i was caught off guard.And she also asked him <br/>\nwho his best friend was.This really pissed me off, after the fact, <br/>\nbecause I think she was trying to be sneaky with the &quot;socialization&quot; <br/>\nissue. But I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better response than what he <br/>\ngave her...&quot;My brother is my best friend&quot;. I had such an in your face <br/>\nfeeling...it was great.But then we had to go back on monday, 4 days <br/>\nlater, and she proceeded to say that she was really concerned which <br/>\nthrew me for another loop and we got into a discussion about <br/>\nschooling etc.Now I know she is a mandated reporter, so am I, I work <br/>\nwith abused kids in a residential facility, but I think I was more <br/>\nappalled to think that someone would question me.Not saying that i am <br/>\nperfect, far from it but really. plus she dosen&#39;t know me....wait <br/>\nthis sounds like i am justifying what she did. I am not. As a dr. she <br/>\nis pretty good.But she did put a bug in my bonnet which then in turn <br/>\nstarted worrying me that she would call DCF and I really don&#39;t need <br/>\nthat aggrivation now.Normally I probably would have let this <br/>\nsituation just roll but with 3 kids at home, 6 months pregnant with <br/>\n#4 and a husband 2 weeks post-op with shoulder surgery #4 I think she <br/>\njust hit a nerve.I did get a copy of the K-8 curriculum guide for the <br/>\nstate of CT and I did look at it about 2 years ago but as I read it I <br/>\nrealized that my 8 yo was not up to thier &quot;standards&quot; in some areas, <br/>\nlike reading,but was well advanced in other areas like science and <br/>\ngeography...stuff he really enjoys. Of course I can think of all this <br/>\nstuff now.

How embarassing - it didn&#39;t even make sense :)   I will expand -<br/>\n  We have home schooled for 12 years and I have been reading about unschooling for 10 of those years - attempting it then getting sucked back in to schoolishness, back and forth.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  My whole desire is to be able to trust my kids&#39; natural curiosity to learn and I want to deal with my fears as to why I keep going back to schoolish things (we do a math paper and spelling list once a day) - why can&#39;t I just let it go?  I know a lot of it is people-pleasing - maybe I want to be &quot;liked&quot; or feel like I belong to &quot;both&quot; groups....hmmm, I&#39;ll have to ponder that some more.  After reading the posts for the last couple of days, I&#39;m sure that my issues will get dealt with faster than I thought :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We do foster care and have 3 foster kiddos right now as well as 4 kids we birthed and 1 we adopted.  The foster kids have to go to public school and that is interesting considering the complete contrast of everyone else.  Have any of you ever had your kids go to public school?  If so, what do you do about homework?  My feeling is I don&#39;t really give a rip about their homework or grades for that matter so sometimes I have them do it, and sometimes I don&#39;t.  I tell the teachers that I am more concerned about their emotional well-being than their academics right now, which I can get away with because of their situations.  But after a few months it doesn&#39;t hold much water!  One of the kiddos loves to do her homework, but the others have to be reminded.  Would an unschooling way of approaching this be that they are accountable to the whole ball of wax (going to class, taking tests, doing homework, etc.), or would it be that they do only as much of that as they want?  We don&#39;t<br/>\n really have an option of whether they go or not, although if they miss a day or I keep them home because I want to I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it one way or the other.  Any thoughts?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Again, I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the posts and appreciate the candid honesty that is represented.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Foust &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:soldout641@...\">soldout641@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hi, my name is Shannon.
