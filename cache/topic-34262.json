People always seem to stare with fear or<br/>\ndisgust when a baby/toddler enters a restaurant.  We once went to a<br/>\nJapanese restaurant - the hibachi/knife tossing type - for my birthday. <br/>\nI knew Blake would love it, and he did - even the food.  But we got such<br/>\nodd looks for bringing a then 5 yr old to such a &quot;grown-up&quot; place.  He<br/>\nwas perfect.

And he does stuff<br/>\nwith daddy, too, on the weekends - the boy stuff that like rocks in the<br/>\ncreek/fort building/car tinkering stuff!   Who knows if Andrew will ever<br/>\nwant to tag with them since he&#39;s such a mommy&#39;s baby right now (still<br/>\nnursing).  Our family outings are generally limited to Target, the<br/>\ngrocery store, maybe the park or something like that, or just<br/>\nsight-seeing.  Andrew detests his stroller (always has) and doesn&#39;t walk<br/>\non his own (getting there).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know our activities and outings will just continue to evolve as the<br/>\nboys grow and take on new interests.

When I first pulled my 10 yr old son out of school (just<br/>\nat the first of this year, so I&#39;m still new at this), it was such a<br/>\nblessing in so many ways.  School actually interrupted our lives in so<br/>\nmany more ways than I ever realized.  He was never a &quot;scheduled&quot; baby --<br/>\nnursed when he wanted, napped when he wanted, etc.  I was met with SO<br/>\nmuch criticism -- &quot;you should make HIM get used to being in YOUR life,<br/>\nnot plan YOUR life around HIM.&quot;  I was just floored by that, and it came<br/>\nfrom lots of different directions.  Rest assured I didn&#39;t change my<br/>\n&quot;wicked ways&quot; of mothering my baby -- besides, how exactly does one make<br/>\na baby conform??   I could go on and on about this...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry -I sidetracked (I do that a lot).  Going to school those few years<br/>\nhe did, we just got through the days.  We had to be up by a certain<br/>\ntime, eat at a certain time, leave, etc.  And of course the school<br/>\nschedule was rigid and unbending.  I didn&#39;t have the confidence in<br/>\nmyself at the time to &quot;school&quot; my own child - how sad is that?  But<br/>\nthat&#39;s all changed (getting to this point is yet another long story I&#39;ll<br/>\nshare if anyone is really that interested) and we&#39;re living our lives. <br/>\nWE live them.  Not by a schedule and not by someone else&#39;s expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2nd son, now 2 and 1/2, will NEVER be a scheduled kid of any kind. <br/>\nHe never has been predictible- not even before his arrival in the world<br/>\n- never does the same thing two days in a row and I seriously doubt ever<br/>\nwill.  And they are happy, healthy, thriving little boys.  Hungry = eat <br/>\ntired = rest or sleep  want to go outside? GO!  We do like others have<br/>\nsaid - go to different activities, but we don&#39;t schedule them.  And if<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing something already engaging when it&#39;s time for whatever<br/>\noutside activity is planned, we choose.  Well, my oldest chooses which<br/>\nhe would prefer to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned knowing someone who does certain things on certain<br/>\ndays.  I have a friend who cleans on Mondays, regardless.  Her birthday<br/>\nwas on a Monday.  She cleaned all day.  I don&#39;t get it.  I once asked<br/>\nher if she could just clean when something is in need of cleaning.  She<br/>\nwas baffled.  And someone mentioned in-laws who are rigid in scheduling.<br/>\nMine, as well.  And I cannot get through to them that although we do not<br/>\nhave any particular hard and fast nap time, my little one does tend to<br/>\ndrift off after lunch (somewhere between 1 and 2 in the afternoon). <br/>\nEvery single holiday &quot;dinner&quot; is at high noon, no exceptions.  And no<br/>\ncrib, no guest bed (no one allowed in the master bedroom), no place for<br/>\nbabies to sleep.   I&#39;m skipping the rest of these events until further<br/>\nnotice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so refreshing to know that we&#39;re not alone in living our<br/>\nwhat-may-come lives.  I do not like to dread to do something.  I do not<br/>\nlike to plan and plan and plan because when I used to do such planning,<br/>\n9 times out of 10 it never played out like I planned in the first place.<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to relax, take in the day, smell the roses, etc.  Why should<br/>\nmy kids not have that same opportunity?

And when we visit them, nothing will move <br/>\nthem from their very ritualized life. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nThe inlaws are like this.  Dinner is always at 6pm, floors are mopped <br/>\non Mondays, laundry done on Tuesday, and so on. When we visit them, <br/>\nand when Andy has gone alone to stay with them for a time (they live <br/>\nin Hawaii, we&#39;re in New Mexico) he loves the orderly schedule <br/>\naspect.  He&#39;s even willing to go to bed at a set time so he can stay <br/>\non schedule for what grandma has planned for the next day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be easy to look at this and think it means I should put him <br/>\non a schedule.  But when I look closely I see that the demands of a <br/>\nschedule imposed by someone else wear on him.  He picks up repetitive <br/>\nbehaviors that serve as an outlet for personal control over his own <br/>\nlife.  I can see where if Andy had to live on someone else&#39;s schedule <br/>\nit would slowly destroy his peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Sandra said, we regularly work with others&#39; schedules -- Monday <br/>\n& Friday playdates with our local group, soccer game on Saturday, <br/>\nvolunteering at a friend&#39;s farm, meeting friends at the zoo, etc.  <br/>\nThese tho are things we choose to do, they&#39;re always optional and <br/>\nanytime we find it&#39;s not working for us on any day, we can just say <br/>\nno.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we schedule our own activities and outings.  It helps Andy (11yo <br/>\nds) to know what we have on the calendar for the next day.  He likes <br/>\nthe predictability of having a schedule -- even a loose one -- but <br/>\nneeds to be able to choose and alter that schedule as his needs and <br/>\nmoods change.  Dan (7yo ds) is very much a spontaneous person -- he <br/>\nresists most attempts to schedule him, convinced there&#39;s always <br/>\nanother time to do whatever he&#39;s not doing now. Throw in my oldest <br/>\nwho has his own place but overnights with us a night or two each <br/>\nweek, and who relies on me to help him with grocery store runs and a <br/>\nride to school when he&#39;s overnighted, and there are some required <br/>\nschedules we all accommodate. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d never be able to impose a schedule on our kids, but it does help <br/>\nto have a general idea of what we want to do and when things are  <br/>\nhappening.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree tho that scheduling isn&#39;t rightly a part of unschooling.

When we were in Japan and they came to visit they would get visibly flustered if we missed their 11:00 coffee ritual. And when we visit them, nothing will move them from their very ritualized life. They&#39;ve been ex-pats for much of their life, sort of the last of the British colonialist generation, and I can picture them carving out a little Britain for themselves wherever they went. David has said that their cooks, wherever they lived be it Malaysia or Oman or the Phillipines or Hong Kong, always had to cook a meat and two vege for dinner. He&#39;s said that it wasn&#39;t as good or as companionable as eating in the kitchen with the staff. I would much rather figure out ways to move off a schedule than lose out on an experience because I couldn&#39;t shift. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Bob Collier &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobcollier@...\">bobcollier@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 14 April, 2008 3:38:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and schedules?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kim Musolff&quot; &lt;kmoose75@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do unschoolers have schedules?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens, happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

My first daughter set a very regular eating and<br/>\nsleeping schedule almost from the moment she was born.  It was nothing I<br/>\ndid really, I just followed her lead and did what felt natural.  If I<br/>\nhad tried to duplicate that same schedule for my second child, I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve been spinning my wheels and making life more difficult than<br/>\nneeded.  Both of my kids feel safe and secure because of meeting their<br/>\nneeds, not because of any schedule.  It was more about the<br/>\npredictability of me meeting their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; My girls are 7 and 9 now so we can be looser but I notice they still<br/>\nget upset if I let them go past lunch and they suddenly say, &quot;Oh, no, we<br/>\nmissed lunch!&quot;. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would a certain age create a more loose schedule?  I think perhaps<br/>\nthat the tightness of a schedule would cause a child to be upset about<br/>\nmissing a lunch hour.  If there wasn&#39;t a tight schedule it would just be<br/>\na child wanting something to eat because they are hungry.  How can<br/>\nsomeone miss lunch, if they haven&#39;t had it yet?  You can&#39;t miss<br/>\nsomething you have yet to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems unnecessary to create that kind of tension within a home when<br/>\nyou could focus on making it happy and fun while meeting the needs of<br/>\nyour children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not that it&#39;s a tragedy, we just go ahead and get something to eat. I<br/>\ndo think children want and count on us to be their guides. Some<br/>\nunschoolers will disagree with my opinion regarding having a loose<br/>\nschedule but I find it helpful!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only is it not a tragedy, it isn&#39;t really anything that should be<br/>\nremarked upon with exclamation.  It&#39;s lunch, it&#39;s hunger.  I&#39;m wondering<br/>\nif a schedule like that would cause a child to rely on a time clock and<br/>\nif that would really be conducive to unschooling.  I really think it<br/>\nwould hinder the free flowing way that unschooling works, even if you<br/>\nhave a &quot;loose&quot; schedule that can be broken, it begs the question, &quot;why<br/>\nhave a schedule at all?&quot;.  Why not live life and do things and if<br/>\nsomething requires a time commitment, then so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy suggesting that kids need time schedules to create safe and secure<br/>\nkids, it opens the door to suggesting that kids also need math and book<br/>\ntime and recess.  Those are all ideas touted at school to promote the<br/>\nidea that predictability creates safe and secure kids that are ready to<br/>\nsoak up what a teacher tells them.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and schedules?","postDate":"1208140722","msgId":34288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0dWczaStpanFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MTIyMzE2ZzFhYjE0OWVmbmJhNDQzYjAxNzNhZGRhMGZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34285,"nextInTopic":34290,"prevInTime":34287,"nextInTime":34289,"topicId":34262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Home <br/>\ndays look like vegging,playing, board games, maintain our home,lots of <br/>\ncomputer and TV time,cooking..you name it....Both types of days bring <br/>\nmuch joy!  The only scheduled things in our home life is Dh&#39;s work <br/>\nhours...my part time work and my GS commitments...and the girls <br/>\nrespective interests&#39; scheduled pratice times...and of course any <br/>\nDR.appointments! We love the  spontantety of our lives...and it makes <br/>\nus think long and hard about making a commumitment to a new <br/>\nactitivy/group that would rob us of that freedom/flexibilty! All that <br/>\nbeing said...our lives are not devoid of plan/ing. It&#39;s just that we <br/>\nchoose, we make the plan..not someone or thing else. <br/>\n<br/>\nElisabeth, Mama to Liv(9)and Lex(7)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling and schedules?","postDate":"1208100936","msgId":34269,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4MjMyMjlFLTJBRUQtNDk4Mi05ODY1LTlGNEI0ODRCMzVENkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MTIyMzE2ZzFhYjE0OWVmbmJhNDQzYjAxNzNhZGRhMGZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MTIyMzE2ZzFhYjE0OWVmbmJhNDQzYjAxNzNhZGRhMGZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34265,"nextInTopic":34271,"prevInTime":34268,"nextInTime":34270,"topicId":34262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Is there an unschooly way to schedule your days?
