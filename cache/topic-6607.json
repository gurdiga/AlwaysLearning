Just sort of <br/>\ngeneral negative little side comments. We&#39;ve ignored it for years, but <br/>\nsomehow it seems worse and I&#39;ve started to talk to my daughters about what <br/>\nthey&#39;re hearing from her. I wasn&#39;t ever sure whether to talk to them about it <br/>\nor not - it is mild stuff, something like, &quot;Well, what do you expect from <br/>\nhim, he&#39;s a &#39;boy&#39; after all&quot;  - but one day we were all together and she said <br/>\nsomething directly TO my daughter - something derogatory about boys - and it <br/>\nwas really just too much to ignore. So I have felt forced to point it out to <br/>\nmy girls and now they&#39;re aware of it, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6621,"nextTopicId":6627}}
