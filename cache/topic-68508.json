I would sympathize lightly and briefly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Saturday night while a lot of us were at a conference in Sacramento, a homeschooling mom in Fresno died, leaving a mid-teen son.  A haircut isn&#39;t death, and even though he&#39;s young, and he&#39;s sensitive, at some point it&#39;s not unreasonable for a parent to say &quot;Sorry; it will grow back,&quot; and no more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we treat every haircut and messed-up Lego project as seriously as we treat death, blindness, miscarriage, then we&#39;re helping them live in fantasy world and not helping them find ways to be grateful for what they do have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents would have aid no, no haircut.  My dad didn&#39;t want me to cut my hair ever.  But my mom didn&#39;t want me to have bangs.  Even the hair on my head was controlled, controlled.   But your son had choices.  And you are being sweet and kind to him.   That was your move.  Now his move needs to be NOT to make you feel guilty about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read the other responses.  I hope no one recommended treating it like the end of the world.  If he WANTED to keep it buzzed, you would need to cut it every couple of weeks.     I used to shave Marty&#39;s head, protesting that I would rather not, every week or ten days, for years, when he looked like this:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/photo/martysolo.jpg\">http://sandradodd.com/photo/martysolo.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI would offer to pay for the barber, and Marty would ask me to just do it.  (And his head was smoother than the photo.  That had the rest of the family photoshopped out, by me… I shave better than I photoshop.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":343381924,"authorName":"Lucy Banwell","from":"Lucy Banwell &lt;lucy.web@...&gt;","profile":"lucylists","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to handle ( mom) big emotions.","postDate":"1344451165","msgId":68513,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1OTc3NkQ1LTMzRUQtNEQzNi05MDlBLTBCMURBMzVGMjBCMUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEExNERGNTc3LUQ5MzQtNEZFNi1CQTVDLTBCQTQ0OTU1NTQ1M0BtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzNDQ0NDgzMTUuMTUxMzkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEExNERGNTc3LUQ5MzQtNEZFNi1CQTVDLTBCQTQ0OTU1NTQ1M0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68512,"nextInTopic":68515,"prevInTime":68512,"nextInTime":68514,"topicId":68508,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
