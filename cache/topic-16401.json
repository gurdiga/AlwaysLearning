The first two times, I just dropped him off, <br/>\nbecause Holly was with me and she&#39;s underage for that group.  Once was at the mall <br/>\nand once outside a movie theater.  I saw the other moms, one I knew and others <br/>\nI didn&#39;t, and I waved and smiled and drove off.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday it was at someone else&#39;s house, a video game playing marathon thing.  I <br/>\nwent in and hung out and introduced myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mom I&#39;ve known for some time was there, with her only child, a son who&#39;s <br/>\nprobably 14.  He&#39;s very unhappy and has been since I&#39;ve known him.  He was taken <br/>\nout of school for being bullied and for being profoundly unhappy.  That was <br/>\nseven years ago, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was having fun today until his mom started in on soda.  He&#39;s only allowed <br/>\nto have soda on weekends, because he needs a high protein diet and so they <br/>\ndon&#39;t let him have any soda on weekdays and if he has soda the sugar in it makes <br/>\nhim really sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said that probably faster than it took any of you to read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thanked the hostess warmly for having the kids over, and I left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to say &quot;Soda doesn&#39;t prevent a high protein diet from working, and <br/>\nwhy is it okay for him to be sick on the weekends but not weekdays?  What <br/>\ndifference does it make?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known her son half his life.  He&#39;s not happier now than he was when I <br/>\nmet him.  He might likely be happier now than he would be had he stayed in <br/>\nschool all that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be happy if I were him either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis relationship with his mom isn&#39;t sensible and warm.  COULD be.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was already involved in setting up a four-player game in another room, <br/>\nand will walk to Active Imagination afterwards, or call for a ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s friend was walking up to the house as I got home.  They&#39;re playing <br/>\nBarbies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has a friend up playing video games.  In forty minutes, Kirby will <br/>\ndrive for the first time, by himself, to karate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning we got his provisional license, and he&#39;s on the insurance now, <br/>\nand today&#39;s the day he takes my van away and I stay here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust his driving.  I don&#39;t trust everyone else.  He&#39;s never changed a <br/>\nflat.  He doesn&#39;t have a cell phone.  That worries me some.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the adrenaline in my elbows, from thinking about him driving alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both be fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Frustrated child discussion","postDate":"1064322166","msgId":16402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJrcGc5bStldXM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3Yy4yMDllNjRkOC4yY2ExOTgwOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16401,"nextInTopic":16409,"prevInTime":16401,"nextInTime":16403,"topicId":16401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Has it always been this way, or did you have rough <br/>\npatches?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is only 10, but he&#39;s very independent and strong willed.  <br/>\nGood traits, yes, but I tend to be a worrier and have a hard time <br/>\nfinding the balance between accepting his desire to be on his own <br/>\nand make his own decisions (like ride his bike everywhere, including <br/>\nhigh traffic areas, without a helmet for example) and my very strong <br/>\nneed to protect him.  It sometimes feels like protecting our <br/>\nrelationship is in direct conflict with protecting *him*. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example... there was a party at the beach near us the other <br/>\nday that went on past dark... a very big party with bonfires etc.  <br/>\nThe ocean was quite rough due to the aftermath of the hurricane, and <br/>\nhe was swimming and riding the waves while I was there during the <br/>\nday to pay close attention in case he needed help.  I needed to <br/>\nleave after dark because my 4yo was tired and cranky and 10yo wanted <br/>\nto stay with friends.  That was fine with me, but one stipulation <br/>\nwas that I didn&#39;t want him to go back in the water again... the <br/>\ncombination of rough surf, no lifeguards, after dark, and the fact <br/>\nthat the only other adults he&#39;d be in the presence of had been <br/>\ndrinking and were socializing and not paying attention was too much <br/>\nfor me.  This resulted in a very tense argument between the two of <br/>\nus, and I&#39;m alarmed that these clashes are happening more frequently <br/>\nas he gets older.  The *most* alarming thing to me is his seeming <br/>\nbelief in his own invincibility.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s a mother to do in these situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Frustrated child discussion","postDate":"1064320520","msgId":16401,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Yy4yMDllNjRkOC4yY2ExOTgwOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16402,"prevInTime":16400,"nextInTime":16402,"topicId":16401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Really nice post, Retta.
