Losing a special pet friend is <br/>\ndifficult. I can still cry when I think about my dear friend JoJo, my <br/>\nAustralian shepard that died when I was 10.<br/>\nMy best friend in Jr. High had a rat named Templeton that we loved dearly. I <br/>\nremember taking Templeton on my shoulder to all my classes at music/art camp <br/>\nat the University.<br/>\nWhen he died we placed him in a coffee can, sprinkled him with holy water <br/>\n(not sure what made it holy other than the fact that we decided it was) and <br/>\nburied him in her back yard with some pomp and circumstance. We even invited <br/>\nour siblings to attend, which they did. It was a very proper burial.<br/>\nRitual and ceremony are helpful when you&#39;re sad...a nice way to pay tribute <br/>\nto a dear friend.<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4677,"nextTopicId":4694}}
