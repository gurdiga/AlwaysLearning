Our choice was to live at a<br/>\ndistance, see them seldom, and control the environment<br/>\nand terms on which we do see them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was pretty much how we dealt with my mother when she was alive. She<br/>\npassed away last January, as I have posted before I think. She lived in<br/>\nGalveston, TX and one of her great aspirations was to have us also move<br/>\nthere - fat chance! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she would start displaying her ignorance on the phone I would<br/>\nimmediately end the conversation - nicely but at once. EG: She: Jayn should<br/>\nbe writing her name by now. Me: No she shouldn&#39;t good bye Mum I love you<br/>\ntalk to you soon. Click.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I would send her a website from a source that she would likely respect<br/>\n(this was crucial) on the topic. Usually I would get an apologetic or at<br/>\nleast respectful email after a few days. It really was ignorance on her<br/>\npart, rather than rigidity. I can&#39;t remember what I sent her about the early<br/>\nname writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of sources she would respect the example I can always remember is<br/>\nabout breast feeding - I sent her the page from American Academy of<br/>\nPediatrics since she had a lot of respect for Doctors like her dh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This time span was not a punishment to<br/>\nthem, but a much needed physical and emotional break<br/>\nfrom each other.  I believe it&#39;s easier after such a<br/>\nbreak (not necessarily 2 years, but it should be a<br/>\ngood deal longer in comparison to whatever the normal<br/>\ninterval has been between visits and interactions) for<br/>\nboth parties to &quot;start fresh&quot; without real or imagined<br/>\ninjuries fresh in the mind and with the courteous<br/>\ndistance of relatives who have not seen each other for<br/>\na while allowing you to set a new tone to your<br/>\ninteractions for the future. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was born my dh called his mother to tell her of the name we had<br/>\nchosen. Her first response was &quot;oh I don&#39;t like *that* name&quot;. Dh replied,<br/>\nvery steadily and calmly although with no sense of wavering or pleading,<br/>\n&quot;Mom..I don&#39;t want to hear your negativity.&quot; Click - by her that is. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did not hear from her for 2 years. But she is not an ordinary<br/>\ngrandmother.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I feel kinda dirtied now that I&#39;ve finished it<br/>\nthough, so I think I better read something else to<br/>\ncleanse my brain.  Any suggestions folks? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read enough about Dobson and the Ezzos on line to know that it makes<br/>\nme too sad - I lose sleep worrying about all these poor children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrain cleansing literature - the latest Alfie Kohn &quot;Unconditional<br/>\nParenting&quot;; &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter; &quot;The Explosive<br/>\nChild&quot; by what&#39;s-&#39;is-name; &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; by Aletha Solter and of course:<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/unschooling .<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What do you do about people<br/>\ntelling their kids what they can and can&#39;t eat and do<br/>\nwhile in your home, both when the parents are present,<br/>\nor as pre drop off instructions?  I know this topic<br/>\nhas come up here before but I can&#39;t remember the<br/>\ndetails.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our neighbor recently got on the phone and started going on about her<br/>\nkids not eating &quot;junk food&quot; - a rather vague designation that varies<br/>\ndepending on the child - at our home, dh simply and clearly said, &quot;No I&#39;m<br/>\nnot going to enforce that here.&quot; He is so inspiring. Part of my response is<br/>\nto put away the chocolates and cookies and chips and lollipops - so that it<br/>\nis not putting temptation cruelly right in front of them (also they will<br/>\ntake candies and secrete them about their persons and smuggle stuff home). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have said to them in the past, especially if they have come in<br/>\nunannounced and then seen and wanted something that I suspect is forbidden,<br/>\nis to say that I doubt that they should because their mother will probably<br/>\nnot allow them to return if she thinks they are coming here and eating<br/>\ncandy, and offer them some strawberries or grapes instead. It never felt<br/>\nperfect, but it was really about saying something that Jayn would hear as<br/>\nnot being my choice to refuse someone food. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever with James being so upfront, now I just say &quot;I don&#39;t know if your<br/>\nmother would want you to have that, so if you are hungry please go home to<br/>\neat and then you can come back&quot; (It&#39;s just 40 feet down the hall - everyone<br/>\nelse always brings their own kid&#39;s food in a sack). If it is a kind of treat<br/>\n(for them) like I have made brownies or James&#39; birthday cake, I will have<br/>\nthem phone their Mom for her permission - also if they started to argue<br/>\nabout it being something they were allowed. So far she has always said yes,<br/>\nso I am even more confused. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest it still doesn&#39;t feel perfect - although better - but the<br/>\nupside is that I am not being eaten out of house and home. In the past,<br/>\nespecially before I only allowed one over at a time, they would very swiftly<br/>\nclean us out of foods that I can only assume are designated &quot;treats&quot; at<br/>\ntheir place - snack size Pringles, small chocolate bars, Smarties (the US<br/>\nkind), any cookies we had except for oatmeal (too healthy?), corn chips and<br/>\npopcorn. I have even become reluctant to make popcorn because Renee takes<br/>\nhers and pours a *ton* of extra salt onto it (last time she left us with<br/>\nNONE in the shaker until I bought more). With Jayn I don&#39;t care what she<br/>\nchooses to add to her popcorn, because she is living free of food related<br/>\nemotional issues, but I don&#39;t know about Renee. I have to think that even a<br/>\nbig pile of salt on the rare occasions she is here probably won&#39;t hurt her -<br/>\nbut I would hate to be proved wrong if she turns out to have high blood<br/>\npressure or some undisclosed medical condition. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;I used to get hyper vigilant about my kids&#39; behavior<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;when I was in a place where the others were<br/>\n </span></blockquote>over-&gt;controlling their own kids and being irritated<br/>\nthat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;mine were there.

I have worked really hard at not being sharp<br/>\nand impatient sounding, sort of living by example if I can - with mixed<br/>\nsuccess, but I certainly feel a lot of stress at those times.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Our choice was to live at a distance, see them seldom, and control the environment and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1054494849\">I can totally relate with you on the dilema of<br/>\nunhealthy relatives.  Our choice was to live at a<br/>\ndistance, see them seldom, and control the environment<br/>\nand terms on which we do see them.  These combined<br/>\nfactors have allowed our children to know their<br/>\ngrandparents (for instance) in a healthy way while<br/>\nremaining unaffected by their negative and unhealthy<br/>\nbehaviors.  We don&#39;t allow these relatives to have our<br/>\nkids overnight alone or to babysit them, nor do we<br/>\nplan extended visits at their homes.  When visiting us<br/>\nthey stay elsewhere nearby (camping, hotel, etc) and<br/>\nwe limit visits to a few days maximum.  Public/neutral<br/>\nterritory to meet on is a very good thing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sandra suggested, we gave our extended family the<br/>\nultimatum of either treating us with decency and<br/>\nrespect or not seeing us at all, and then stopped all<br/>\nvisits (maintaining amicable letter/picture/phone<br/>\ncontact) for two years to give them time to mull this<br/>\nover and take us seriously or not and/or adjust their<br/>\ninteractions with us, as well as give us time to heal<br/>\nand cope with past issues with these folks within<br/>\nourselves.  This time span was not a punishment to<br/>\nthem, but a much needed physical and emotional break<br/>\nfrom each other.  I believe it&#39;s easier after such a<br/>\nbreak (not necessarily 2 years, but it should be a<br/>\ngood deal longer in comparison to whatever the normal<br/>\ninterval has been between visits and interactions) for<br/>\nboth parties to &quot;start fresh&quot; without real or imagined<br/>\ninjuries fresh in the mind and with the courteous<br/>\ndistance of relatives who have not seen each other for<br/>\na while allowing you to set a new tone to your<br/>\ninteractions for the future.  Your mileage may vary on<br/>\nthis idea.  We also offered literature as Sandra<br/>\nsuggests and said we&#39;d be happy to discuss it after<br/>\nthey had read it (&quot;Put up or shut up&quot;)  Refusing to<br/>\nfight about it is a good idea.  Who cares what they<br/>\nsay or think anyway?  If they can&#39;t be reasonable,<br/>\nmature and decent, don&#39;t put any weight in what they<br/>\nsay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as holidays go, we choose to stay home on<br/>\nholidays for many reasons such as creating our own<br/>\nspecial traditions, basking in quiet family<br/>\ntogetherness without stress and conflict, not desiring<br/>\nto travel during poor weather and peak traffic<br/>\ncongestion, not enjoying hectic crowded events,<br/>\navoiding drunken relatives, and more easily catering<br/>\nto our certain family members&#39; specific special<br/>\nmedical and dietary needs.  With the medical and<br/>\ndietary needs as a consideration and the travel<br/>\nweather factor for us over two mountain ranges it&#39;s<br/>\neasy enough for us to make our excuses without<br/>\noffending anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I, too, didn&#39;t understand what was meant &gt;&gt;my<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;talking back.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really means that children are not permitted to<br/>\nrelate to adults on the level of equal human beings,<br/>\nand not allowed to question authority or orders given<br/>\nor discipline meted out.  I just finished reading<br/>\nJames Dobson&#39;s The Strong Willed Child and I am still<br/>\ndizzily digging my way out from under all the self<br/>\nrighteous slag and King James scripture.  Amusingly,<br/>\nhis books concepts are mainly backed up and<br/>\nillustrated by his quoting of himself in his own<br/>\nprevious books or tapes (when he&#39;s not quoting<br/>\nscriptures that is.)  This book, for those not<br/>\nfamiliar with it, is a handbook for fundamentalist<br/>\nChristians in the correct manner for administering<br/>\ncorporal punishment (beatings with a switch or belt<br/>\nrecommended, as well as other nerve or muscle pinches<br/>\nadvised) to children &quot;at every instance of<br/>\ndisobedience.&quot;  James Dobson, FYI, is a PhD clinical<br/>\npsychologist,- marriage, family and child counselor,<br/>\nhas been a staff professor and attending physician in<br/>\nprestegious children&#39;s hospitals and universitites and<br/>\nis the founder of the Focus on the Family organization<br/>\nwhich produces a worldwide radio program among other<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book recommends not beginning corporal punishment<br/>\nuntil children are over 6 months of age, and that one<br/>\nshould &quot;take great care&quot; with large teenagers as<br/>\nattempting corporal punishment with them can have<br/>\ndangerous results.  I&#39;ll say!  They are big enough to<br/>\ndefend themselves!  The book explains that this method<br/>\nis critical in &quot;good Christian&quot; homes because<br/>\notherwise the children will not grow up to submit<br/>\nthemselves to every authority in their lives such as<br/>\nbosses, landlords, professors and so forth, but<br/>\nchiefly so they can &quot;submit themselves to the<br/>\nauthority of God.&quot;  He repeatedly asserts that without<br/>\nthreat of looming punishment even adults would not<br/>\nbehave themselves.  He also repeatedly refers to<br/>\nchildren as brats, which I think is telling.  He uses<br/>\nhis own family and children as his chief and only<br/>\nnamed examples of proper techniques and discipline,<br/>\ngives entire long speeches which parents are to<br/>\nutilize verbatim with their children, (he suggests<br/>\nmaking copies of these as well as charts in the book)<br/>\nand of course also explains how responding to infant<br/>\ncries &quot;too readily&quot; will create a spoiled and<br/>\nmanipulative child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was like a 240 page peep show window into a certain<br/>\nbroad cross section of American culture that is pretty<br/>\nscary to behold, particularly in light of the current<br/>\nadministration.  The question and answer sections in<br/>\neach chapter with &quot;real questions from readers&quot; was<br/>\nparticularly interesting.  Dobson even does some John<br/>\nHolt bashing, which I found wryly amusing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was asking me why I was &quot;wasting my time&quot;<br/>\nreading it, was I rubbernecking the train wreck of it<br/>\nor what?  But you can&#39;t make intelligent arguments<br/>\nagainst something without being educated on the<br/>\nsubject.

It hurts because we want to<br/>\nunequivocally trust our family with our child in a big<br/>\nfuzzy happy village of love.

If you feel the loss of a larger family<br/>\ngroup, begin building a new family of choice around<br/>\nyourself of friends and their families of various ages<br/>\nwhom you CAN trust your child and yourself with. <br/>\nFamilies are built by love and there are many people<br/>\nin them not blood related to each other.
