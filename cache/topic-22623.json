One thing that will <br/>\nhelp immensely is to learn yourself, on yourself (and by observing your son&#39;s <br/>\nlearning), that most learning doesn&#39;t come from books, and confidence, trust and <br/>\nrespect are in actions and interactions and are slowly built, not gotten from <br/>\nbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here.  Books   Something to read about books.   Not because reading is <br/>\ngood, but you   might want to distance yourself a little bit from books.
