Things like, &quot;Yes. you&#39;re right...you really DO need that new <br/>\ncomputer that costs $6000 to complete your project, and of course I will get <br/>\nit for you&quot; come to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got one of those looks yesterday, and it has continued into today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my son Julian about SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism).  He is in <br/>\nawe. The idea that there is such an organization, with all those cool things <br/>\nto do and learn has just thrilled him. He loves the idea that there are <br/>\npeople out there like that. We spent an hour together looking at the web <br/>\nsites and e-mailing local contacts, and he has glowed since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have a new family project. (My partner Beth is also thrilled, as <br/>\nthere is a local Storytellers Guild.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8566,"nextTopicId":8570}}
