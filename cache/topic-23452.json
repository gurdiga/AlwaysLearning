I am a forty-<br/>\nsomething mom to 4 kids.  Oldest is an RN and on her own now (she was <br/>\nnot homeschooled).  I have a 12 yo and two 7 yo&#39;s.  We have been <br/>\nhomeschooling for over 5 years, but only recently the light has <br/>\ndawned for me that we are missing the boat.  I re-created school at <br/>\nhome for the first year, eased up a bit each succeeding year, and <br/>\nfinally have decided that I need to relax and enjoy my children (and <br/>\ntheir education).  I can&#39;t believe the overwhelming feeling of relief <br/>\nthat this brings to our family.  Whew.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has the time to reply, I would love to hear some ideas from <br/>\nthose of you who can look back and say, &quot;I wish I would have <br/>\nknown....&quot; and share them with me.  My children and I are currently <br/>\nenjoying the Children of the World and Religions of the World videos, <br/>\nand we have learned a tremendous amount from watching them.  My 12 yo <br/>\nspends a lot of time playing the piano and being relieved that she no <br/>\nlonger has to fret over Saxon 87 every morning.....my 7 yo son still <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe that it&#39;s &quot;OK&quot; to go on the Scholastic&#39;s Brain Play CD <br/>\nrom even though we didn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; yet....his 7 yo twin sister is <br/>\nso easy to please, she&#39;s just plain happy to be able to stay in bed <br/>\ntill 10am and not rush to eat breakfast, brush her teeth, and hit the <br/>\nbooks ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to being a part of this group, and I thank in advance <br/>\nany of you from the &quot;been there -- done that&quot; side of the fence who <br/>\noffer words of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23432,"nextTopicId":23453}}
