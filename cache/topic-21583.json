I would think it ceases to be Unschooling if the parent<br/>\ninsists on everyone visiting a museum after unwillingness or dislike of the<br/>\nplan had happened to be expressed, or if there was some preconceived outcome<br/>\nto which the kids were being guided - &quot;write a report about....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I could care less wether or not I am <br/>\nlabeled a teacher, unschooler, homeschooler or etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever on an Unschooling discussion list it is often helpful to people&#39;s<br/>\njourney for practices, language use and ideas which are probably *not*<br/>\nleading towards Unschooling to be challenged if they come up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be useful for some people to think about whether it really is OK<br/>\nfor anyone to consider oneself a &quot;teacher&quot; at any time in their journey. It<br/>\ncertainly doesn&#39;t work for me right now in my personal ongoing deschooling<br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn&#39;s (5) exposure to the idea of a teacher being the person responsible<br/>\nfor a student&#39;s learning achievement is minimal. However it has still<br/>\noccurred that she has given the credit for her own learning to the teacher<br/>\nshe has been exposed to previously - it happened really strongly after the<br/>\ncouple of unproductive swimming lessons she had, despite it being all her<br/>\nown work to learn to swim the following summer without any more lessons. The<br/>\nidea that a child (particularly) won&#39;t learn without some expert teaching is<br/>\nendemic in mainstream culture, so Jayn hears that idea (the &quot;empty vessel&quot;<br/>\nmodel) sometimes.
