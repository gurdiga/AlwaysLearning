It was not uncommon to see someone sleeping<br/>\non a cot next to someone washing their goat next to a teenaged girl shaving<br/>\nher legs.

She&#39;s eleven and her feet almost dragged the<br/>\nground.), had a great visit with Adriane&#39;s birthmother, saw the giant<br/>\nsculpture made out of butter, and got very little sleep.
