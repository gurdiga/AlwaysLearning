Growth means stretching, often<br/>\nuncomfortably, and it means wrapping your mind around<br/>\nideas that may at first seem repellant or at least<br/>\nuncomfortable, then maybe begin to make logical sense,<br/>\nand finally to ring with a clarity which makes you<br/>\nwonder how you didn&#39;t see it before.  Growth is often<br/>\nsomewhat scary, leaping into the unknown, letting go<br/>\nof preconceptions and of well worn and comfortable<br/>\nlong standing beliefs and practices.  Because it&#39;s<br/>\nscary it often causes defensiveness.  Growth is also,<br/>\ndespite popular cultural lip service, not something<br/>\nthat is often supported or encouraged on a personal or<br/>\ninterpersonal level.  Being &quot;polite&quot; to the point of<br/>\nbeing dishonest, not &quot;rocking the boat&quot; or disrupting<br/>\nthe status quo, and minding your own business are seen<br/>\nas much preferable to encouraging growth in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this list because it&#39;s different than that. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not afraid to be honest, while not holding<br/>\ngrudges or making personal attacks.  I don&#39;t see flame<br/>\nwars on this list, just occassional ruffled feathers<br/>\nas those doing some stretching feel the burn of<br/>\ngrowth, sometimes reacting defensively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this list because there is always so much good<br/>\nfood for thought, differing meaty and meaningful ideas<br/>\nto chew on and experiences to take in that are not<br/>\nhand holding and cooing like the many &quot;support group&quot;<br/>\nlists out there, as Sandra described.  I love the real<br/>\nexchanges happening on this list, as opposed to smarmy<br/>\nand meaningless (or worse) small talk and self<br/>\ndefeating back patting that only serves to stifle<br/>\ngrowth and silence doubts or questions or exploration.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also love this definition of unschooling Sandra gave<br/>\nduring the recent dicussion (guess I&#39;m just full of<br/>\nlove!):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s maintaining a lifestyle in which learning<br/>\nflourishes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s always what my life is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21635,"nextTopicId":21660}}
