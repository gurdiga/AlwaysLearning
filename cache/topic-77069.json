The measure as to whether something should be avoided or not is not &#39;is this allowed if I&#39;ve signed myself up to unschooling?&#39; or &#39;is this effective?&#39; but &#39;does my child want this?&#39; and &#39;Is my child enjoying this?&#39;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Effectiveness is irrelevant. Fun is vital. When it stops being fun, she can stop doing the workbook. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would say &#39;sure, I&#39;ll help you learn how to write more neatly. What about a book designed for that? And a new pen? If you practice often, your handwriting will get neater just like your piano playing or hula-hooping or archery will improve if you practice&#39;.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Try not to dismiss an interest just because it&#39;s linked in your head with school and you&#39;ve decided to unschool. My children love having me throw words at them to spell. They like being given sums too and they like trivia quizzes. They enjoy the challenge of testing what they know. They stop enjoying it if it&#39;s too hard but, because we unschool, I can tailor the questions to suit what they want to get out of that few minutes in that moment. It&#39;s joyful and fun. I could say &#39;no, we don&#39;t do that kind of thing because we&#39;re unschooling&#39;...but that wouldn&#39;t be good unschooling ;)</p></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping my daughter with writing and spelling in an unschool-y way?","postDate":"1463541344","msgId":77070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMjJGRERFLTdEM0MtNDU5OC04RTNBLTI4RkFGQjdCMjEwMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5oZ2cyNCticmVocjlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5oZ2cyNCticmVocjlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77069,"nextInTopic":77071,"prevInTime":77069,"nextInTime":77071,"topicId":77069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-.

I think the things she has already been doing are probably the best way to learn to write but she seems to want something more focused – and maybe she wants to improve faster. She mentioned a workbook but I am not sure that would be effective or fun in the end. Thanks!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she has asked or hinted for a workbook and you get one for her, it doesn’t matter whether you’re sure that it would be effective or fun in the end.  What will have happened is that you said “Sure!”  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could look for something about italic writing (don’t look for “calligraphy” because they’re going to be talking about pens and ink and nibs, and that’s too much).    You could probably find some printable worksheets online pretty easily and let her help you find some that look interesting to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe evil of a workbook is in someone else trying to make a child do it, and do it right, and do it in order.  If you give it to her just as you would a coloring book or a book of mazes or connect-the-dots, and if she plays with it and learns something, fine.  And if she doesn’t, it’s not a big deal. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoing mazes and dot-to-dots can help with handwriting, too, just in getting pencils/pens/markers to do what one envisions.  You can find printables of those, too, or order things online (if you’re not near a store that has some).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- she is writing more independently and her spelling is improving which I have assumed is related to improved reading as well as to writing she has been doing as part of other activities she enjoys like designing board games, playing videogames and messaging on her ipod.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting older and farther (in time and space and thought) from school helps, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yesterday my 9 yo daughter asked if I would “teach” her how to write.

Maybe you could critique something she’s written—not an extensive critique of every flaw, but something she’s doing consistently, perhaps—just point it out and show her another way or two to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPointers can be like ten-second “lessons” and that might satisfy her desire and quell her fear without you feeling too teacherly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":561807031,"authorName":"","from":"staceyraeme@...","profile":"staceyraeme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"helping my daughter with writing and spelling in an unschool-y way?","postDate":"1463534468","msgId":77069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5oZ2cyNCticmVocjlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77070,"prevInTime":77068,"nextInTime":77070,"topicId":77069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yesterday my 9 yo daughter asked if I would “teach” her how to write.

She went to school\nuntil the end of grade 2 and had a lot of trouble with spelling in school. Studying for spelling tests usually led to frustration and tears. When she left\nschool she really could not spell at all and for a long time avoided writing –\nby hand or on computer. Recently I have noticed that she is writing more\nindependently and her spelling is improving which I have assumed is related to\nimproved reading as well as to writing she has been doing as part of other activities\nshe enjoys like designing board games, playing videogames and messaging on her\nipod. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-299537026MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Anyway, I am wondering how to support her\nin ways that will meet her desire to be ‘taught’ how to write but will be fun\nand not stressful for us both. I think the things she has already been doing\nare probably the best way to learn to write but she seems to want something\nmore focused – and maybe she wants to improve faster. She mentioned a workbook but I am\nnot sure that would be effective or fun in the end.
