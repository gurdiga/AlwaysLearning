The original poster is gone, but still, this jumped out at me today in a still-open e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky had written:  &quot; If he knows those things make him feel bad why is he asking for them? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nThe response was:<br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 3 years old, he was not yet making that connection - he only knew<br/>\nhe wanted it.

On the a peanut allergy,<br/>\nsince it can be life threatening, and he tested very high, I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to make that chance with his life.

Yet<br/>\n&gt; after these last few days of discussion I was wondering, wanting more<br/>\n&gt; understanding on what you meant by limiting/controlling.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, Ethan, had asthma for the first five years of his life.  We didn&#39;t know why, and I was getting frustrated by the fists full of prescriptions we left the doctor&#39;s office with.  Finally, seeing my despair, our pediatrician ordered allergy tests.  They were very revealing.  Ethan tested very allergic to corn, and peanuts, moderately allergic to dairy, and mildly allergic to wheat.  Can you imagine what I thought?  What the heck are we going to eat?!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Ethan was not dangerously allergic to any of these foods.  He had previously been eaten peanut butter and jam sandwiches several times a week.  Corn was in almost everything we ate.  Bread was a daily part of our diet.  Chocolate milk was his favourite drink.  Yet, something was causing him regular breathing problems, and finding out if it *was* one of these foods was important to me.  Getting him off prescription medicine was important to me as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for a few months I stopped buying any of these foods.  Ethan and I started reading labels together and began experimenting with alternatives.  I tried to make it fun.  I ended up learning about a lot of food related things.  I had no idea corn was so prevalent before our journey began.  Corn is a fascinating plant actually!  Ethan learned about what was in our food too.  He also learned where our food is made, what percentages mean, what vitamins are, that nuts can taste like milk, that chocolate doesn&#39;t need milk or corn to taste great... <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part was that the asthma stopped.  He hasn&#39;t needed any medication since.  But our learning didn&#39;t stop there.  After a bit of time, we began reintroducing some of those foods.  If I noticed changes I would point them out.  Ethan also noticed changes on his own.  Milk every day certainly does seem to bring on congestion for him, but he still can enjoy his favourite ice cream cone any time he gets a craving for one, and he really loves chocolate almond milk.  One time, just the smell of peanut butter brought on an asthma attack, although recently, he ate some peanuts at a restaurant and was fine.  Similarly, he can have corn for a couple days.  Much more than that, he begins coughing.  We started making popcorn for movies again.  Still, he often requests some other treat - like chips or a snack platter filled with food he discovered he loved because we began down this road together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it isn&#39;t about control.  It is about partnering through.  And, if the focus is on learning and not on the food allergy itself, then the doors actually open wide into a world full of fun food possibilities just waiting to be discovered as a natural part of living in the world to one&#39;s fullest!   Understanding about each our own unique relationship with that vast world of food deepens too.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: food choice & my parental responsibility","postDate":"1331902465","msgId":66175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqdmQ2MStsYXVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzE4NTc4MjAuMTY2NDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66174,"nextInTopic":66177,"prevInTime":66174,"nextInTime":66176,"topicId":66146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ive always wondered what made that difference.

Refused bananas and eggs for along time prior  to us even knowing he was allergic to them.  His milk allergy is not as severe as his peanut allergy and he seems to know that, will occasionally try things with dairy in it and usually descides he doesnt want more based on the way he feels.  Has never shown any interest in peanuts though.  He understands about labels and has for several years and will ask if things are ok for him.  Ive always tried to have safe foods for him that were atleast as desirable as things that might be offered at activities in case.  Because i try to do that he is now ok with waiting.  For ex.  The other day my dad took us to dinner, the kids wanted dessert but there was nothing he could eat.  I just said, if you dont mind waiting we&#39;ll stop and get you an italian ice on the way home.  He was happy and patiently waited for the other kids to eat theirs.  <br/>\nI have aquantences though whose kids have allergies and they are often found eating foods that make their lips swell up and itch.

But people are saying Be your child&#39;s partner which sounds like missing the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a lot like people&#39;s initial reaction to unschooling. They&#39;re searching for words that sound like teaching so it&#39;s hard to get what people are saying instead about how unschooled kids learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a mom is a child&#39;s partner, she takes on the parts the team needs that the child can&#39;t yet. She doesn&#39;t do it for him so much as in conjunction with him. She steers the team away from roads, pointing out the cars, mentioning the cars, puts the information into the environment so the child can pick it up when he&#39;s able. She steers the team toward better options for fun (and learning). She creates a safe atmosphere for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child has a problem with peanuts, since she&#39;s the one bringing food into the house, she keeps peanuts out of the home. As the child&#39;s partner, she checks ingredients in snacks with him -- even before he can understand. She will carry an epi pen or pack one with him. She will mention peanuts will make him sick when it comes up. The goal isn&#39;t to teach him or get him to understand but to create the safe atmosphere where he can learn. All the little skills going into avoiding peanuts will be a natural part of the child&#39;s life and he&#39;ll pick it up as naturally has he picks up English.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Mama Bears and partners will both have safe children, the focus of partners is in creating a safe environment for the child to learn. The focus of Mama Bears is keeping the child safe. It&#39;s not that Mama Bears don&#39;t want their kids to learn. It&#39;s that it&#39;s not built into the process of being a Mama Bear. It&#39;s an add on to being a barrier between the child and the world that&#39;s too dangerous for the child to navigate. It&#39;s an add on that many people won&#39;t add on when they grasp the concept of Mama Bear. Their focus will be on being a barrier between their child and the dangerous world that wants to harm their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut being the child&#39;s learning partner, learning and a rich, safe environment for learning are central.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: food choice & my parental responsibility","postDate":"1331874823","msgId":66173,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqdWk2Nyt1a2RjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBSFQxU016MWliY2dUUk9qdGtMVVAycHBDb296R19RVW1kRnJtcnRnYW01ZGNWelAzQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66172,"nextInTopic":66174,"prevInTime":66172,"nextInTime":66174,"topicId":66146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===ok! thank you, If that is always true, then I guess I don t need this list for support.=== You ve only been a member since March 4th.

Learning about<br/>\nhow bodies work and how they react to different foods and activities is<br/>\nPART of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids can learn about foods and their own needs and safety and health the<br/>\nsame way they learn to be safe in the out-of-doors or in a kitchen or near<br/>\na lake. Maybe try to consider it that way. Give them opportunities to<br/>\nlearn. Too much restriction, control, and limiting is counterproductive to<br/>\nhelping them learn. Conventional parenting does a LOT of controlling and<br/>\nlimiting - often so much that it results in serious shut-downs of learning<br/>\nprocesses and creates resistance or apathy in the developing child. Some<br/>\npeople take &quot;freedom&quot; as their slogan and go the opposite extreme and don&#39;t<br/>\nstep in to control or limit enough. I have had some of those people come to<br/>\nmy house and think their kid should have &quot;freedom&#39; to tease my dog or play<br/>\nin my bed or throw food around the living room. They weren&#39;t invited back,<br/>\nand focusing on &quot;freedom&quot; is not helping their kids learn valuable things<br/>\nabout how to function in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about control or freedom; it is about creating a<br/>\nlifestyle in our families that is conducive to learning. In general,<br/>\nthough, controlling, limiting, and restricting isn&#39;t conducive to learning.<br/>\nThat is a general principle. In general, try to avoid those if you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers try to find ways to keep kids safe enough (not perfectly 100<br/>\npercent safe at all times) that, at the same time, support learning. What<br/>\nthat looks like in YOUR family is going to depend on too many factors for<br/>\nus to have a clue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201148075,"authorName":"zann jo","from":"zann jo &lt;zannjo@...&gt;","profile":"hanlioma2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] food choice & my parental responsibility","postDate":"1331859920","msgId":66166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSFQxU014T25xcUNLPWNiYXZfRHdCSk1LdCtkZENzMTlUbUwzMWdvVHdWaDcwNzA2Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk0ODcxOUNDLURDQ0MtNDUxMC1BOUFGLUQ2M0Y1RTMzNjg4REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBSFQxU015emNuVGZTSHV6Vi1wXzU0WXZ5OF9fRnQyZFhOVnc1bzdhRll2MG5DdXhoZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPEYwQjkzMUZGLTE1M0MtNDdFRC04NjkxLTQ0REU0QzY0QjEwN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBSFQxU015ME5reSt5R29aMWFwWlcraE8zYWVXWno5K1NHamFiOFo3TW1DUm14NlpoZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDk0ODcxOUNDLURDQ0MtNDUxMC1BOUFGLUQ2M0Y1RTMzNjg4REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66165,"nextInTopic":66167,"prevInTime":66165,"nextInTime":66167,"topicId":66146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok, I am really slow because this feels like you are just nit-picking my post and entirely avoiding my question.

My son (2nd child)<br/>\nloved*loved*loved tofu, edememe, etc. that was what he mostly ate.<br/>\nAt three years old he was also having a lot of difficulty with extreme<br/>\nagitation (think tasmanian devil cartoon), sleep difficulties<br/>\n(difficulty to sleep, night waking multiple times every night,<br/>\nfrequent night terrors (2-5 nights every week)).  I was letting him<br/>\nfreely choose his food, bedtime, sleeping location, etc.   I was<br/>\nconfident that he would sort it all out in his own time.<br/>\nThen he had two Grand mal/tonic-clonic seizures that both lasted<br/>\nalmost ten minutes, within 2 months, Yet &quot;normal&quot; EEG&#39;s (no epilepsy).<br/>\n That is when I started looking to the pediatrician for other testing,<br/>\nthen pressing for more testing after all of the tests turned up<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; and negative.  The pediatrician finally suggested allergy<br/>\ntesting (only because I kept calling her).  At that time I was sure we<br/>\ndid not have any allergies, my mommy instinct had not failed me yet!<br/>\nAnd had saved us so many times before!  After the allergy tests, we<br/>\neliminated soy, peanuts, tree nuts.  Within two weeks he was sleeping<br/>\nthrough the night for the first time in his life.  In the last two<br/>\nyears he has had only 3 isolated night-terrors that were around the<br/>\nsame time as a difficult flu.  His personality/demeanor/... is<br/>\ncompletely different, he is generally settled (no more extreme<br/>\nagitation), happy, peaceful guy.  I think I was selective in listening<br/>\nto my instinct, I believed that sleep and food could always be self<br/>\nregulated if given freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I want to assume that if our children are having difficulty<br/>\n(sleeping, focus, un-happiness) it is our responsibility to take note<br/>\nand limit the access until they are a bit older to make the connection<br/>\nthat, for example, &quot;If I eat this food, then I will feel bad &quot;.  How<br/>\nhis allergies manifested were not as obvious as anaphylactic, it could<br/>\ntake hours or days for his body to produce a noticeable reaction to<br/>\none particular ingestion.  And that often we even *crave* the allergic<br/>\nfoods… definitely the situation with my son.  For me it was extremely<br/>\ndifficult to make this change, it was so against how we had been<br/>\nparenting for the previous 6 years.  So where I am needing clearer<br/>\nunderstanding is how to maintain a balance of the extremes: we need to<br/>\nmaintain a sense of responsibility to accurately *see* our children.<br/>\nIf we are genuinely feeling concerned, it does not automatically mean<br/>\nwe are harboring suspicion.  And sometimes we shouldn&#39;t wait 30 years<br/>\nto see how it all turns out.  Our guy now has the bandwidth to do so<br/>\nmany more things, since he is no longer pre occupied with the allergy<br/>\nsymptoms.  I still feel guilty that his food choices were having such<br/>\na negative affect on his life and I didn&#39;t do anything about it for<br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Suzanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66200,"nextTopicId":66226}}
