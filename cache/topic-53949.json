I think it&#39;s beautiful when people make connections and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree or think that these things *are* law of the universe BUT I also don&#39;t think that I can definitively say they *aren&#39;t* because I don&#39;t know.

I find some born again Christians to be irritating but I wouldn&#39;t call it bogusosity. I try to look at the positive. I try to see the good. <br/>\n<br/>\n++It is simply true that until someone stops thinking about &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>\nthey can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Until someone wants to see natural <br/>\nlearning, it&#39;s going to be buried in a world of &quot;education&quot; things, <br/>\nopportunities, phrases and expectations.

I think it&#39;s a matter of perspective. I don&#39;t see things in terms of law of attraction...So I&#39;m not going to see it as attraction...I&#39;m going to see it as you described because that is more the perspective I&#39;m coming from. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n+++Cool. I was embarrassed, and not to keep her in my life, but just to <br/>\nacknowledge that she was right, I worked to become more positive. <br/>\nAlso in the next few years I discovered and utilized Adult Children of <br/>\nAlcoholics, and La Leche League; had kids; got married. Not in that <br/>\norder.+++<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t involved in La Leche League but I now have many friends who are. Why accepted as an extension of unschooling? Or am I wrong is it not?<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommended your book to three other people today. I carry it around right now with a highlighter. I think it&#39;s that good. My friend who also unschools her two boys asked me...&quot;Why do you like it so much? Is it full of revelations?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;No, more affirmations.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m already there, in mind, and have been for many years now. It&#39;s the actions that I&#39;m still working on. None of it comes from spiritual/religious anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s philosophical, FOR ME. Again...basically stemming from libertarian philosophy (and I don&#39;t mean the Libertarian Political Party - I mean philosophy/principles).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any of this make me a better unschooler? Does is make the Law of Attraction people better unschoolers? Does it make the Christian unschoolers better? etc etc... aren&#39;t they all just pieces?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope at least some of that made sense...I&#39;m really tired. I hope all of you moms had a great mother&#39;s day. I had the most wonderful day. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\nReply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post | Start a New Topic <br/>\nMessages in this topic (10) <br/>\nRecent Activity: a..

I actually stopped reading and spoke to my son, Wolfgang, about your &quot;contradictions&quot; on that page...and how it *didn&#39;t make sense* you had said those things after saying the other stuff right on that page. I told him I was a little disappointed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I turned the page. And laughed and laughed and laughed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, my *real* point of this post is that John Taylor Gatto is relevant. In my opinion...in the same ways that Attachment Parenting and LLL are. Libertarianism is another gateway into unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you extend your existing principle of non-force/non-violence unschooling is really the only place you can end up. This is really how *I* came to unschooling. Extending my philosophical principles to all parts of my life and all people. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically I am 100% Radical Unschooler...reality is I&#39;m still probably only 85-90% there in my actions but I work to change my behaviors to be more compassionate, loving, open, mindful everyday. It is a gradual process. And it started in me with thinking of people as individuals believe it or not Ayn Rand 16 years ago. (and I&#39;m not even a huge fan of hers, totally disagree with her thoughts on altruism and such)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd <br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 08, 2010 11:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] John Taylor Gatto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-And it&#39;s good to check when he said what he&#39;s quoted as saying <br/>\nbecause his views on various things have shifted over the years.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they didn&#39;t shift from direct experience with unschooling <br/>\nfamilies, and the original statements weren&#39;t made because of direct <br/>\nexperience with unschooling, so it didn&#39;t seem like the best thing to <br/>\nquote in a radical unschooling forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t understand that when questions are asked of other <br/>\nunschoolers, the questioner has found a place like RUNning or this <br/>\nlist *because* they want the input of people with unschooling <br/>\nexperience.
