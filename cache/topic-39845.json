The introduction of<br/>\nformalized education has had more of a flatlining effect.  Initially,<br/>\nhelping a mass populace to be able to read was a good thing, and that<br/>\nprobably did help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, everything else after that part of the article was an example of how<br/>\neducation doesn&#39;t really create success.  And the author is right about<br/>\nlosing graduates by not engaging them in the multi-dimensional aspect of<br/>\nthe high tech world and continuing with the boring one dimensional spoon<br/>\nfeeding of information to a populace that should be out DOing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m really struck by the notion that our culture is really<br/>\nmissing out by locking away teens from the world and keeping them stuck<br/>\nand in waiting mode.
