Beginning with one of Shakespeare&#39;s <br/>\nbest-known, best-loved works, the comedy The Taming of the Shrew, each <br/>\nkit has everything needed to produce and act out a thoroughly <br/>\nentertaining 45-minute version of the play: cards for a director and <br/>\ntechnical director, showing how to cast the play, direct it, stage it, <br/>\nand create easy sets and sound effects; cards for each of the major <br/>\nparts, with a summary of the character and suggestions on how to play <br/>\nhim or her; ten cleverly abridged copies of the script; and key props. <br/>\nFor TAMING OF THE SHREW, each kit contains a working plastic recorder (a <br/>\n&quot;flute&quot; instead of a lute) and plastic Groucho eyeglasses. Each kit also <br/>\ncontains a booklet introducing the wonderful world of Shakespeare, <br/>\nacting tips and exercises, recipes for grog, and other good party games <br/>\nto play.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: shakespeare for kids?","postDate":"1235624374","msgId":42572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDRTE4OUY2QjFEQzQ2MjZBQkE2MDE4RjBCNEZBOTlBQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvNTdoaCs1aHQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdvNTdoaCs1aHQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42571,"nextInTopic":42582,"prevInTime":42571,"nextInTime":42573,"topicId":42547,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"cool, i will check it out and see if he is interested! ...
