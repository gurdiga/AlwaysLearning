Ron & Andrea<br/>\n(atypicalhomeschool.net) used to run it but had to stop and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen thinking about trying to get it started again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you that don&#39;t know what it is...a blog carnival is a<br/>\nbunch of related blog posts on one topic, such as unschooling. It&#39;s<br/>\na great way to find new blogs, read some great posts and let other<br/>\npeople know about your blog. Not to mention, it kinda build a nice<br/>\nunschooling community feel among the bloggers. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now it would be held once a month (a lot of carnivals are held<br/>\nevery week but we can build up to that).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll you would do is submit one of your posts on unschooling to me<br/>\nevery month and I&#39;ll put the whole thing together.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you please reply at this link if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/lnp4l\">http://tinyurl.com/lnp4l</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to keep the replies in one place so I know how many people<br/>\nare interested without having to remember all the places I&#39;m going<br/>\nto post this. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, can you please ask on your blog? If you could direct your <br/>\nvisitors to the above link so they can reply, it would be a big <br/>\nhelp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (11) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26069,"nextTopicId":26072}}
