The mom I was talking to was<br/>\n<br/>\nunhappy about things with her three youngish adopted kids, VERY close in<br/>\nage, and <br/>\nshe was feelng trapped and stuck.  I asked her if she had her car in the<br/>\n<br/>\nparking lot.  Yes.  Charge card?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told her she didn&#39;t have to go home.  She could go to the airport<br/>\nand <br/>\nfly to Japan.  (Forgot to ask if she had a passport, but it could&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen <br/>\nHonolulu, then, or Fairbanks, or the other end of Canada.)  I said she<br/>\ncould be <br/>\nhaving plastic surgery by Tuesday and never come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme?<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh.  If people have THAT much choice, surely they can choose to have<br/>\n<br/>\ndinner later, or to move the TV to another room.   &quot;We had no choice&quot; is<br/>\njust <br/>\nstarting to get to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople choose not to kill themselves.  That&#39;s usually a good choice.<br/>\nBut <br/>\nchoosing to stay with children means having the responsibility for that<br/>\nchoice.  <br/>\nWe chose to babysit a batch of kids today, so four extras.  It will make<br/>\nour <br/>\nwhole day more exciting.   I could have chosen the less exciting, less<br/>\nhelpful. <br/>\n I could choose to put them all in the van and drive them to their mom<br/>\nand <br/>\nsay &quot;Changed my mind.&quot;  At any moment, there are choices, and<br/>\nresponsibilities, <br/>\nand options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19902,"nextTopicId":19891}}
