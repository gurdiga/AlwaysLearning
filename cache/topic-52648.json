They don&#39;t seem to mind the &quot;limit&quot; (which is that we pretty much all head off to bed at roughly a certain hour), given they have the freedom to do stuff quietly for a while, and often put their light off themselves.  But with three sharing the room, it&#39;s not going to be a matter of each person making their own choice about lights off anyway......they have to consider each other anyway don&#39;t they?  Sometimes it is probably just the bossier kid getting his way, but generally they seem to agree about lights off. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, well stuff like choc milk/treats and sweets, we buy a certain amount, the amount we can afford financially and  I have no problem witht he idea of letting them &#39;go for it&quot; excpet that more than once in our house the littlests have missed out if I didn&#39;t share something out myself, which was kind of traumatic for the one who missed out!   I feel that people should  be able to trust that their share of the drinking choc will still be there when they want it, so short of setting a limit, or hiding some for the littlests, or repeating myself a bit about not over-doing it ......it is hard to know how to work it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is, that if something presented as  part of a principal of considering others, rather than a rule &quot;because i know whats best for you&quot; will the children respond differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder, if we are honest that some things are our preferences - is it Ok for Mum and dad to have SOME preferences  in the running of the home if we respect our childrens preferences as much as practically possible too?  I prefer the computers to go off when we have our evening meal and stay off while we get everyone ready for bed, and do dishes etc... then we often either watch a DVD or read together , before they go off and read in bed or the youngers and I get into bed.   This is just my preference, not a &quot;moral law&quot; of some kind, and  no-one has ever complained, and it is nice to see everyone at the end of the day before bed and do something together.<br/>\nIs this the same as &quot;limits&quot; in the sense of &quot;only one hour computer a day&quot;, does it feel the same to the child, as far as trust goes?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, be gentle with me, i am totally new to these concepts and thinking about them very much.<br/>\nVanessa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52613,"nextTopicId":52705}}
