However,<br/>\nwe will probably go down that direction a couple of times a year at least,<br/>\nbecause we love the ocean, and my youngest thinks he might like to be an<br/>\noceanographer or marine biologist when he grows up. (not many oportunities<br/>\nfor either one of those where we are right now!) I wish dh was getting<br/>\nstationed at Keesler AFB instead of Columbus, but at least we will be within<br/>\nless than a day&#39;s driving distance of the ocean after we move.  You are<br/>\nwelcome to email me privately any time. Let us know what MS is like, what<br/>\nthings to expect, places to visit (or avoid), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Date: Fri, 19 Apr 2002 18:22:33 -0500<br/>\n    &gt;From: &quot;Sweets&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sweety9@...\">sweety9@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: unschooling conferences<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Hi Suzanna<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure where in Mississippi Columbus is.. guess i should pull out my<br/>\n&gt;map!
