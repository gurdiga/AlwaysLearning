I need some help, and thought <br/>\na few of you could help...If some of you could please write a bit, I&#39;d <br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation:  My baby statys with a very breastfeeding-friendly <br/>\ncaregiver while I work.  She&#39;s been wonderful about feeding and caring <br/>\nfor my baby the way I want her to.  She has other children in her care, <br/>\nhowever, and yesterday a toddler bit my baby!  I&#39;m upset and worried now <br/>\nabout my baby&#39;s safety--but I know it would be hard to find another <br/>\ncaregiver who is so loving and willing to feed my pumped milk.  What <br/>\nhave other mothers done when things like this happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could just write a paragraph or two (or three) about this <br/>\nsituation I&#39;d appreciate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the small print.
