It has been a long time since we went, but Henderson had a bunch of <br/>\nfactory tours at that time.  When we were there we went to the Ocean Spray <br/>\njuice factory,  a chocolate factory, a marshmellow factory and one that made <br/>\nmetal clown &quot;sculptures&quot;.  Each one had huge windows to see the various <br/>\nprocesses they go through in the making of their various products, and at the <br/>\nend you get to sample things. I would suggest you look up Henderson online <br/>\nand see if they still have those if they interest you. My family really <br/>\nenjoyed it.  When we went it was summer and at 118 degrees within seconds of <br/>\nexiting the chocolate factory with various goodies they were all melted, but <br/>\nyou would not have that problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10327,"nextTopicId":10282}}
