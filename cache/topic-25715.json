I have a<br/>\nsister who sends her kids to a Waldorf school and though she and her<br/>\nchildren watch lots and lots of movies...still, something of that &quot;dissing<br/>\ntelevision stuff&quot; comes around to us, though I suspect that much of it is<br/>\njust talk.  I have been up and down about television, partly because of the<br/>\nWaldorf influence (they have some really scary ideas about what television<br/>\ndoes to the minds of children...though my mind seems to work after growing<br/>\nup with a fair amount of t.v....my mother thought it was the best thing to<br/>\ncome along to help her raise seven of us)...still, I worried.  Then I read<br/>\nthe article on dyslexia that was posted on Sandra&#39;s website (my youngest has<br/>\nbeen labeled &quot;dyslexic&quot;) in which the writer said he learned tons from<br/>\nwatching the BBC...since then, we&#39;ve joined Netflix free for a month and<br/>\nlast night we all watched Patton and have ordered some other WW II<br/>\nmovies...my oldest (15) does an online Math program (ALECS) and he loves to<br/>\nput on an old Andy Griffith video while he works on math...it gets him going<br/>\nin the morning.  And I remembered that I always did my homework to<br/>\ntelevision at night and was an honor student.  Anyway, thanks again, Sarah,<br/>\nfor the honest portrayal of television in our lives.  &quot;The truth shall set<br/>\nyou free.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 02, 2006 11:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 1894<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 messages in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopics in this digest:<br/>\n<br/>\n      1.

I think<br/>\n&gt; even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And it really cracks me up.  Because TV is like a<br/>\n&gt; godsend around here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My girls really like to wake up slowly watching TV.<br/>\n&gt; This is great for me because it gives me a chance to<br/>\n&gt; drink my espresso, read the paper (still looking for a<br/>\n&gt; dog), switch the laundry, maybe do a little pilates,<br/>\n&gt; and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>\n&gt; in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>\n&gt; lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>\n&gt; this up first.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>\n&gt; down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>\n&gt; shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>\n&gt; conversations have happened because of this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>\n&gt; and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>\n&gt; room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>\n&gt; passively and watch TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It offers siblings a chance to do something together.<br/>\n&gt; Or, it can get them apart!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>\n&gt; due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>\n&gt; activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>\n&gt; beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>\n&gt; study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>\n&gt; movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>\n&gt; musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>\n&gt; has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>\n&gt; sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>\n&gt; to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>\n&gt; make me cry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>\n&gt; and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>\n&gt; glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>\n&gt; never see in person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>\n&gt; connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>\n&gt; watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>\n&gt; us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>\n&gt; for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>\n&gt; bonding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>\n&gt; as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>\n&gt; housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :).<br/>\n&gt; These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>\n&gt; full advantage!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It really adds to our never-ending list of questions.<br/>\n&gt; The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>\n&gt; and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>\n&gt; great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>\n&gt; kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>\n&gt; actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>\n&gt; than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>\n&gt; because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>\n&gt; feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>\n&gt; their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>\n&gt; they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>\n&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>\n&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>\n&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>\n&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>\n&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>\n&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>\n&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>\n&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>\n&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>\n&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>\n&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>\n&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>\n&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>\n&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>\n&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>\n&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>\n&gt; you get the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?
