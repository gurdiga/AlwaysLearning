She<br/>\njust got back her &quot;mid-mid-terms&quot; and has gotten 3 A&#39;s and one B. We always<br/>\nhave had access to learning material. I also have 2 foster daughters. One in<br/>\ngrade 2 and one in grade 6.  Makes me so thankfully I am home-schooling the<br/>\nother kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo essentially Amanda is good at writing tests!! But she also is doing well<br/>\non her assignments & understanding the material. She did fail one test which<br/>\nrequired pure memorization of dates & facts. Basically music history. She<br/>\nsaid it was stupid & she&#39;d never use it & that most of the class failed too.<br/>\nShe says she wants to be............a TEACHER!!! Yikes!! So she will need<br/>\ngrades in the 90&#39;s here in Canada to get into University for Teaching. So if<br/>\nthat is what she really wants to do she is going to need to teach herself (I<br/>\nam showing her &quot;tricks&quot;) how to memorize just so she can get the marks for<br/>\nthe tests to do what she thinks she wants to do as a &quot;grown-up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly has helped in my DH realizing that the kids don&#39;t need an 6.5<br/>\nhour school day to become &quot;learners&quot;...only took 14 years for him to get<br/>\nthis!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKerri, mom to Amanda(14), Emma(12), B(11,foster dd), Maddison(10),J(9,foster<br/>\ndd), Jonah(7), Saige & Claire( 4, ID twin dds) & baby boy Teagan(Sept. 2003)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21161,"nextTopicId":21197}}
