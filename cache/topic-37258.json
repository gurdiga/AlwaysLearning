I started unschooling in the U.S. and when I moved over here I stayed happily latched to my unschooling title. I also tend to read much more heavily on the U.S. sites than I do on any UK ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nRun.ning is pretty new. And the UKUnschoolers is a little newer. There are 9 members, one who lives in the U.S. It is hard to have a local group cover a whole country. The ideas to be discussed are better off being talked about on a less location specific forum, and the specifics of local LEA problems aren&#39;t going to be easily addressed by 9 people from across all of the UK. But it is fun to have 8 people, who I didn&#39;t know before I created the group, suddenly appear. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clare.kirkpatrick@...\">clare.kirkpatrick@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 19 August, 2008 8:52:06 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] In UK was Re: Introduction<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Lynda - I&#39;ve never found that group before - is it busy?
