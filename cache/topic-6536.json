Thanks to unschooling I have given up a <br/>\nlot of control, and am still working on letting go of more.  I <br/>\nfigured when people started assuming he was a girl at first glance, <br/>\nhe would ask for his hair to be cut.  Nope.  <br/>\nMy dh has long hair and a good friend of my older son(8) has long hair<br/>\n(he&#39;s 11), so my 5yo has cool role models.  He is very confident <br/>\nabout just stating he is a boy, when people mistake him.  <br/>\nI wish I were better at it.  I feel uneasy for people when I know <br/>\nthey are confused by his clothes and his &quot;boyness&quot;, but also feel <br/>\nweird about offering the information to them(that&#39;s up to my son).  I <br/>\nhave heard disparaging comments about my older ds friend and his <br/>\nhair, when people didn&#39;t know I was the mother of my 5yo.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a stange thing how much of a lesson this has been for me.<br/>\nIt has been a forced process of letting go of what others think, and <br/>\nrealizing how much it really doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Julian has thick curly hair that is cut when he gets around to it. <br/>\nHe&#39;s a very &quot;pretty&quot; boy, and when he was a little younger and his hair got <br/>\nlong everyone assumed he was a girl. I was blown away that he would very <br/>\ncasually say, &quot;actually, I&#39;m a boy,&quot; with no sense of insult or concern. (The <br/>\nperson making the mistake would often get VERY apologetic.)  He didn&#39;t see <br/>\nbeing mistaken for a girl as a bad thing, and certainly it didn&#39;t motivate <br/>\nhim to get more frequent haircuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s hit puberty and no one would mistake him for a girl. (He&#39;s still <br/>\ncute though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6535,"nextTopicId":6539}}
