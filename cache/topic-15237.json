All our shoes live at the front door, or in the car. Gary grew up all over -- his Dad was in the AirForce -- but his folks are from Hawaii, where most everyone goes barefoot.  The only shoes anyone wears are flip-flops.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe lived in outside a very small town in Oklahoma until I was about 12, and were barefoot 24/7 from March 1 to late October.  I remember taking a note to school each March that gave us permission to be barefoot at school.  All the school required was parent&#39;s permission, and we didn&#39;t need shoes again until Nov!  It was a rural, poor area and most of us only owned one pair of shoes each summer -- nice ones to wear &#39;into town, otherwise no one really bothered with shoes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs kids, we used to see who could stand the longest on the asphalt blisters that come up on the road as the days warm up.   I always won, because even then the skin on my feet was like elephant-hide!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd of course, Andy almost never wears his sneakers, preferring flip-flops (we call them slippers, Hawaii fashion).  Sneakers are only to keep socks clean so he can wear them in playland at McDonalds.  He takes off the socks as soon as he sees some other kid barefoot.  Then again, Andy seldom dresses for any kind of cold/wet weather either.  I have photos of him on the playground, running around in shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops in a cold, mid-December rain two years ago!  Every other kid in the picture is dressed like Nanook of the North, and Andy looks like Island Boy!<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree online calendar with sync to Outlook(TM).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Happenings from our home","postDate":"1056041716","msgId":15261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ni4xYzA1ODk2ZS4yYzIzNDRmNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15260,"nextInTopic":15262,"prevInTime":15260,"nextInTime":15262,"topicId":15237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dana, regarding the Raynaud s....does it seem to be worse if you re under stress?
