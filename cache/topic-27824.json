Perhaps has always had a passionate *and* at times intense<br/>\npersonality? I&#39;m asking this too with only 13yrs of mindfully<br/>\nparenting an, at times, intense and passionate daughter under my belt. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is generally a calm, articulate, logical, sweet, caring<br/>\nperson, who laughs a lot, but there have been times when she&#39;s gone<br/>\nthrough more intense, kind of unhappy and angry patches, always around<br/>\nparticular issues (sometimes of an existential nautre) that others,<br/>\nmyself included sometimes, would feel she &#39;should&#39; be able to find a<br/>\nway to let go of. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a keen sense of justice and injustice, which contributes<br/>\ngreatly to her ability to be a fine mediator, and to times when she&#39;s<br/>\ncompletely outraged by something and despite all the great stuff she<br/>\nknows and usually practices in her life, she can not or seems<br/>\nunwilling to let it go of it in what I and others would consider a<br/>\nmore timely manner. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s talked to me about finding my ability to be calm at such times<br/>\neven more infuriating to her (though not always), feeling that I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t care and should really care more, so that exploring the thing<br/>\nthat is infuriating her is more likely to help her move through and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how clear that is, or if it&#39;s relevant to your<br/>\nsituation... Maybe it will be clearer this way. The path through, for<br/>\nus, is the one where we explore the infuriating passion in the same<br/>\nway we would a happy passion. Which isn&#39;t the same as validating the<br/>\nanger or fury, I don&#39;t think. Does that make sense? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has occurred to me, with the help of some wise words from other<br/>\nmindful mothers, that my daughter might be an activist type of person,<br/>\nand that she may well pursue a path in life consistent with the<br/>\npassion and strength that are part of her unique self around issues<br/>\nshe believes important. I&#39;ve been able to move through the fears I<br/>\nfelt for her around that idea, and with that acceptance has come more<br/>\npeace, for us both.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJo R</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":268044201,"authorName":"webbeccjo@nc.rr.com","from":"&quot;webbeccjo@...&quot; &lt;webbeccjo@...&gt;","profile":"webbeccjo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] dealing with anger","postDate":"1169774914","msgId":27870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1Qjk1OTQyLjUwMDAxMDdAbmMucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwMTI1MTAwMnUyNGM4Yjk2MHNiNTY1NmYxNTk5ZGIzN2FhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwMTI1MTAwMnUyNGM4Yjk2MHNiNTY1NmYxNTk5ZGIzN2FhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27837,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":27869,"nextInTime":27871,"topicId":27824,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wish he were still<br/>\naround for me to pick his brain about this...<br/>\nAfter Hannah&#39;s death, when his anger was big and raw and real, I truly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any acceptable tools to help dissipate his anger (as I was<br/>\ndealing with my own big, raw, real emotions).  I picked up some flower<br/>\nessences for the both of us, for him I got Willow, which &quot;helps you find joy<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re resentful and feeling sorry for yourself&quot; We talked about it<br/>\nwhen he was calm, he was open to trying it, but he did once say he was<br/>\nunwilling to take it because, &quot;if I let go of my anger, I will have to let<br/>\ngo of my memories of Hannah.&quot; Other days, he asked to have a few drops in<br/>\nhis water, to have throughout the day. Great insight into what was going on<br/>\nin his head.  So we talked some more; actually I listened some more and gave<br/>\nhim a safe place to talk without my judgment or unsolicited input.<br/>\nWhen anger comes now (we&#39;re almost 11 months past Hannah&#39;s death) I model<br/>\nbreathing, I come to him calm and empty (this won&#39;t be *the last straw*!!)<br/>\nready to hear whatever needs to be heard for him to feel comfortable moving<br/>\non.  We&#39;ve talked about the way anger feels and when it&#39;s productive to have<br/>\nthat feeling (the fight/flight concept) and when it&#39;s not (tough to find<br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve lost when your mind is a red haze of anger).  I&#39;ve asked him<br/>\nwhat he wants from me in those moments, he&#39;s said he just wants me to be<br/>\ncalm and not have a big reaction to his anger, just help him deal with it<br/>\n(without my own whatever getting in the way).<br/>\nWe&#39;ve hit a groove lately :)  Just the other day, I ran in to help find the<br/>\nremote when I heard his angstful cries of having lost it.  He said to me,<br/>\n&quot;mom, I&#39;m not mad, not even frustrated yet, thanks for coming to help right<br/>\naway.&quot; I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s breathing more often when stuff is *beginning* to<br/>\nget to him.<br/>\nMy biggest obstacle has been taking it personally.  My mind&#39;s voice that<br/>\nsays, &quot;see you really are a shitty mother, your kid&#39;s angry no matter what<br/>\nyou do&quot; was the first one to pipe up and scold me.  I can&#39;t be the parent I<br/>\nreally want to be, the parent I know I can be, if that&#39;s how I feel about<br/>\nmyself. (if I don&#39;t wanna play on my own team, who will wanna play with me?)<br/>\nSo, I sat down with that voice and kindly thanked her for coming, but her<br/>\nservices are no longer needed, please leave!  I&#39;ve invited other voices to<br/>\nlive there instead, voices that remind me to breathe through it, this is<br/>\n*his* and not yours, reminding me we *are* a team and *WE* can figure this<br/>\nout together.  That, I think, has made the biggest difference of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, this is one issue where my MIL watches me carefully... having had an<br/>\nangry son herself, and not having had the tools to deal with him peacefully,<br/>\nshe&#39;s very interested in how I deal with Hayden.  It&#39;s obvious now that her<br/>\nparenting style didn&#39;t necessarily *make* him angry, but nor did it leave<br/>\nroom for healing that anger.  My intention in my relationship with Hayden is<br/>\nto give him the tools he needs to deal with all of his emotions in a way<br/>\nthat works for him, is productive in our life and preserves the trust we<br/>\nhave with one another.  I believe as time goes on, she will see the mighty<br/>\nbenefits of the road we&#39;re on.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27775,"nextTopicId":27841}}
