Just reading is fine.  Just reading is GREAT for  <br/>\nthose very new to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\nand<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoyching.com\">http://joyfullyrejoyching.com</a><br/>\nand<br/>\nthe intro and archives at the group&#39;s main page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing it says there is:  &quot;This is a moderated group, with  <br/>\ntrapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance- <br/>\napproval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are  <br/>\nmoderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping  <br/>\nin.) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDO ask questions about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need introductory posts.  Information in the course of other  <br/>\ndiscussion is fine, but an introduction for the sake of an  <br/>\nintroduction isn&#39;t as helpful for a discussion list as for a social or  <br/>\nsupport list.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;me too&quot; and &quot;LOL&quot; are assumed; don&#39;t post those  <br/>\nunless it&#39;s in the course of useful comments that will help others  <br/>\nunderstand unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t write rude letters to the moderators nor to me.  Be with your  <br/>\nkids.  Gather what you need to know.  Don&#39;t be abusive of me nor of  <br/>\nany moderators.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting angry doesn&#39;t mean you need to leave the list.  It means you  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have gotten angry.   Figuring out how to be calm is part of  <br/>\nlearning to unschool.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the questions you have have been asked before.<br/>\nA great deal of information for new unschoolers is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/help\">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/beginning\">http://sandradodd.com/beginning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47149,"nextTopicId":47173}}
