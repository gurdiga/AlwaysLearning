Did you live there?  Near there?  We are actually planning to move to Battle Ground (or somewhere REALLY close to it) in the spring.  It&#39;s crazy beacuse I had never even heard of it before but once I decided to move there everywhere I turn people are mentioning it.  Seriously, it must be a good sign.  :)  I&#39;m trying to learn all I can about the area and so far I LOVE everything I have found out.  I so look forward to living somewhere green and small!!  :) Anyway, if there is anything you could tell me about the area I would love to know.  What&#39;s the unschooling environment there?  Or maybe you don&#39;t live there at all... But you&#39;ve &#39;been&#39; there right?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen this Naturopath mentioned all over in the stuff on the web.

She was extremely thorough and well trained.  <br/>\nHer practice is in Battleground,WA if anyone gets up there. Just across the  <br/>\nbridege from Portland.Get more from the Web.
