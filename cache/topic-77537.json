I said there was nothing funny about this meme. &nbsp;Wrong answer.</div><div><br></div><div>Needless to say, the responses back were defensive. &nbsp;The person who posted it not knowing I was responding and assuming it was my husband asked him if he was okay insinuating that there must be something wrong with him to post such a response. &nbsp;She also said it wasn&#39;t meant as a parenting class thus indicating she was quite irritated with my answer since I was suppose to laugh and agree.</div><div><br></div><div>Your post actually brings up another question for me. Do you ignore these type of posts? &nbsp;Give feedback? Unfriend? I share a facebook account with my husband and some of these posts come from his family or people he worked with so it&#39;s not really up to me to say anything. &nbsp;There was one showing a young child being spanked hard by his mother with another pic of 3 boys looking like gang members. &nbsp;It said something along the lines of if we did more of this (spanking) we would have less of this (the 3 thug looking teens)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would like to know what others do when they come across things like this. &nbsp;I waver between wanting to speak out on behalf of kids and subjecting myself to the wrath of these types of people that can be quite draining. &nbsp;Sometimes I can seriously feel like I&#39;m the lone ranger out there.</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Real support","postDate":"1477067577","msgId":77537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEQjkzODBCLUI2NzItNEREMS04OTM1LUY5MzdEQkY5OEE4RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77538,"prevInTime":77536,"nextInTime":77538,"topicId":77537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone had posted on her own facebook page, and I want to share it.
