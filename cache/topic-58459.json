It doesn&#39;t have to do with shyness, or *liking* being around people; it&#39;s about where you feel energized and where you feel drained. It used to be, even when I&#39;m around people I love dearly, I was drained by that! I needed alone time - especially alone time with no agenda - to get replenished.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething has shifted since we started radically unschooling - and I no longer feel that way around my sons. I GET a lot when I GIVE to them, when I&#39;m really present for them, and being generous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly didn&#39;t expect that (the need for alone time) would ever change, but it did, as my thoughts and attitude changed. Once I really stepped into being a mom, and stopped being the needy child of MY mom, something got filled up in me. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with you - I&#39;m sharing the process I went through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of a time that Seth, my youngest, was quite small. I think it was before he was walking a lot, so right at a year, maybe? I used to get up very early in the mornings, and that was MY time. I could have peace, and not worry about anyone else. Seth&#39;s sleep schedule changed, and suddenly, he was waking up around 5 in the morning - fully awake, not able to be peaced down to sleep again. At first, I was grumpy: this was MY time! Then, I shifted my attitude to acceptance, and appreciation followed. We&#39;d hang out together on the couch, and watch the birds come to the bird feeder. We&#39;d read, or play with Duplo blocks. It became a very special time in my day, and I still remember those early mornings fondly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are young for such a short time. I have more than enough time for me time, now, my sons are 18 and 11. The things I wanted to get done in those early-morning alone times are still things I want to get done, nearly every day, but the time we had to create the relationship we have is fleeting. The dishes will always be there, my one-year-old son is now 11. You know when people say, &quot;You can&#39;t get that time back&quot;?

And then come down to watch a bit of telly/play quiet games.  Later on they like to be carried up to bed when they&#39;re on the point of falling asleep, or when they are asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really isn&#39;t at all chaotic and their bedtime routine has always been flexible- even when they always went to bed at six it was because they were ready.  We never had an arbitrary bedtime... So we haven&#39;t changed anything or abandoned any rules, just that these things change and develop and where before they were early to bed (and to rise!) they now prefer a later routine..<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only that I&#39;m missing my evenings and I think I need to work out how to relax without getting bedtime &#39;done&#39;.

I don&#39;t think so, because of the way you described it, but I think some people want to &quot;act like unschoolers&quot; rather than gradually gain a personal understanding of why unschoolers avoid arbitrary bedtimes.  Not every bedtime is arbitrary.  Putting a child to bed at 7:00 because a book said five year olds should be in bed at 7:00 has nothing to do with that particular child, or with learning, or with peace in the home.   But letting a child stay up as long as he can possibly manage to has little to do with learning or with peace in the home either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246186758,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;yahoo@...&gt;","profile":"sarahlexis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Coping with later bedtimes...","postDate":"1292341101","msgId":58459,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllODMxZCtlaDQxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58460,"prevInTime":58458,"nextInTime":58460,"topicId":58459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have three little boys; 5, 3 and 2 months.  5 and 3, until recently liked a quite traditional routine, going to bed between about six and eight, leaving me","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1417471021\">I have three little boys; 5, 3 and 2 months.  5 and 3, until recently liked a quite traditional routine, going to bed between about six and eight, leaving me with a quiet evening to tidy, do life&#39;s admin and relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently they are staying up later and later and I&#39;m finding it stressful.
