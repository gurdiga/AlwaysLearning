I&#39;d get<br/>\nout of that living arrangement as fast as possible I think. Kids KNOW<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re being treated as lesser beings and keeping him away from<br/>\nsomething he&#39;s interested in (the kitchen) is a recipe for disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids NEED to be part of your world/activities from a very young age.<br/>\nYou&#39;re doing interesting things in there, he wants to help and feel<br/>\nhe&#39;s a capable partner. Jalen would not have let me put him in the<br/>\nsling if I was cooking at that age either. He wanted to DO whatever I<br/>\nwas doing. A small stool is a wonderful took and I&#39;d just make sure to<br/>\nput things back  so the uptight human in the house doesn&#39;t notice. <br/>\n<br/>\nFast meals would be best at this stage of the game on many levels<br/>\nthough. Having a wee one can make prep time difficult even if they&#39;re<br/>\nwelcome. Find him some simple chopping (with a butter knife),<br/>\nmeasuring jobs that he can do alongside you. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also spend one of his naps preparing some simple meals<br/>\n(lasagne, casseroles etc..) and freezing them for future use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to leaving places, sometimes distraction is your best friend.<br/>\nCommunicate with him as the countdown continues, but also have a few<br/>\ndollar store toys, interesting snacks,drinks etc... up your sleeve for<br/>\nthe moments when he just needs a distraction so you can leave<br/>\npeacefully. Getting all the other kids packed up first usually helped<br/>\nus too...he could see we were truly leaving, not just talking about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he does start getting upset, just stop whatever you&#39;re doing and<br/>\nhug him, distract him, hand him a cool toy, some ice, a drink of<br/>\nwater, whatever it takes to calm him before you proceed with a diaper<br/>\nchange or other activity. Running around naked is a great way to learn<br/>\nabout body functions!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Jalen was a very restless sleeper the first four years of his<br/>\nlife (I know, that sounds like forever when your child is 18mo., but<br/>\nit passes and you WILL get more sleep one day). One thing that has<br/>\nhelped him a LOT on stressful nights is Melatonin. I think he&#39;s just<br/>\nmore sensitive to lighting and it makes him more awake than his body<br/>\nreally wants to be. On occasional nights, I give him 1/2 of a<br/>\nsublingual pill (1.5mg) to help him relax into sleep (health food<br/>\nstore for around $8).<br/>\nWith all the electrical lighting these days, some people don&#39;t make<br/>\nenough melatonin, it&#39;s a natural product that has no side effects.<br/>\nWon&#39;t work for everyone of course, but it&#39;s been a wonderful thing for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26220,"nextTopicId":26225}}
