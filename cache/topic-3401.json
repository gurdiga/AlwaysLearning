Those schools which try <br/>\nto teach groups, or universities in which three people work together on a <br/>\nproject or paper are considered wrong, lazy, trouble-making.   We do NOT <br/>\nprize cooperation.  It&#39;s wimpy.  &quot;Cooperative games&quot; are for the disabled, in <br/>\nmost people&#39;s minds.  For the mentally unstable.  For those who can&#39;t handle <br/>\na REAL competitive situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most horrible things any college student can do is to cheat.  <br/>\nCheat at a military academy, and your future takes a sudden 90-degree turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason they can&#39;t &quot;cheat&quot; is that grading is competitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason grades are important is it proves you &quot;earned&quot; something--they&#39;re <br/>\npaying you for your cooperation and time sacrificed, and tasks performed, and <br/>\nhoops jumped.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about learning the material.  It&#39;s about the combination of <br/>\nmemorization, performance, humility, punctuality/attendance, payment-making <br/>\n(finances cannot be forgotten in education!) and turning the other cheek.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo high school is to prepare you for that.  So mid-school/jr. high prepares <br/>\nyou for *that,* and on down to pre-school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, off the track entirely, are unschoolers.  Their goal isn&#39;t &quot;to <br/>\nearn&quot; or to compete.  Their goal is to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir goal isn&#39;t to be the best-outfitted kid on the first day of school, and <br/>\nto earn the most friends of their age group.  It&#39;s to wear something <br/>\ncomfortable, collect things around them they enjoy, and have adult friends, <br/>\nolder kid-friends, younger kid-friends, or no friends at all.  Just whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just whatever&quot; doesn&#39;t fit on the American chart, except for the homeless <br/>\nguys ranting on the street corners, and they&#39;re often criminals.  They&#39;re <br/>\ntrespassing, loitering vagrants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s how we cheat:  Unschoolers never once ever have to &quot;do it on their <br/>\nown.&quot;  They&#39;re  never told &quot;YOU SIT THERE UNTIL YOU GET IT RIGHT, MISTER!&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;Did you have help with that project?&quot;  (&quot;Yes&quot; is their best answer!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we turn our backs on the &quot;earning&quot; portion of the program, and <br/>\nconsider knowledge to be freely available to anyone interested in picking it <br/>\nup, does that make it Marxist?  I don&#39;t think so.  There&#39;s an unlimited <br/>\nsupply of knowledge and thought.  Everyone can be rich.
