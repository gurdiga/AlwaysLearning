Tv and sleep <br/>\nhave probably been our biggest difficulties.  Sleep issues have pretty <br/>\nmuch been put to rest.. ;)  Still working on tv choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking and thinking doesn&#39;t help as much as I wish it would.  I think <br/>\ntalking excites stress in some people.  Not everybody has as hard a <br/>\ntime with it.  But some definitely do have difficulty getting into the <br/>\nswing of things.  Brian and I both grew up within a very narrow set of <br/>\nrules and parameters that we could operate from; we weren&#39;t given many <br/>\noptions.  In some ways, this is more true of Brian&#39;s upbringing than <br/>\nmine.  So learning to see the options we in fact do have is really <br/>\nsomething else, and not altogether comforting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly being a world full of possibilities can be like putting a cow <br/>\nused to a pasture out in the unfenced wilderness with all sorts of new <br/>\nterrain to navigate, and not being sure where to find grass to graze <br/>\nanymore.  Before, the grass was just there wherever the cow went in <br/>\nthat pasture.  It can seem like going from a secure plentifulness to a <br/>\nscavenger hunt just to provide for your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe less discomfort Brian feels in all this the better.  The more I can <br/>\nsmooth things the easier I make unschooling for him to accept.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t always realized that, and even after I have, I haven&#39;t always <br/>\nhad a successful strategy for smoothing the transition.  I mean, <br/>\nBrian&#39;s at work all day so he doesn&#39;t have the time to invest in <br/>\ngetting comfortable on his own.  And I&#39;m the one who wants to do things <br/>\nthis new way.  So I feel that easing is what I&#39;m to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad I have been reading online and getting good ideas all along <br/>\nto head off problems with food and eating.  One idea (which I think is <br/>\nindispensable) is to get in the habit of taking a mini-picnic with you <br/>\nwhen you go somewhere.  I&#39;ve gotten some flack from Brian about it but <br/>\nfelt that if Brian could just experience it, he could see for himself <br/>\nand I wouldn&#39;t have to do so much talking.  And Karl was happily taken <br/>\ncare of with little fuss, inconvenience or expense to Brian so that he <br/>\ncould see the sense in it for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, to smaller or larger degree depending on individual needs, <br/>\neasing rather than suddenly pushing everyone into it helps most <br/>\nfamilies who are making the move to unschooling.  You&#39;re not going to <br/>\ndoing all your living in one instant, so there&#39;s time for gradual <br/>\ngrowing and steady progress into it.  There might not be full agreement <br/>\nat every step but some level of agreement (which you want to be <br/>\ngrowing) and a good strategy for keeping the comfort high (in my <br/>\nopinion, the important part) needs to be there.  I&#39;d encourage you to <br/>\nask here for strategies (very helpful!), something I&#39;ve only recently <br/>\nstarted doing myself which I could have been doing a long long time ago <br/>\nthat would likely have averted a lot of trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 1, 2009, at 4:52 AM, Schuyler wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It helps a lot to see your husband as a loving and caring man who <br/>\n&gt; wants the best for his son.

Try and offer another perspective without words, live the life you are living joyously. Tell him stories about your day and about the things that you all are doing, don&#39;t preach about how what you do is working and what he does isn&#39;t. Be happy and include him in your happiness. Put together a blog of all the things, all the great moments that happen in your day and send a link to your husband so that he can feel more a part of the life you are leading. Be patient, be calm and think of ways that you could help. Could you have offered to make a bag lunch for your son to take or would it have made it worse in that moment? Sometimes it is someone else&#39;s fight and it isn&#39;t your affair. Sometimes other things are a part of why you feel tense. You are changing the way your son is being raised, you are throwing out the things your husband believes work when it comes<br/>\n to raising children. That&#39;s a lot to make someone tense. Rather than yell at him that it isn&#39;t true, you should help him see more why you believe unschooling is a good option. If a conference helped you gain some perspective maybe you should see if he&#39;ll go with you to another one. <br/>\n<br/>\nArun in Australia has a beautiful blog post called the Unauthorised Dad Handbook that might help you think about your husband outlook on unschooling in a different way <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theparentingpit.com/unschooling/unauthorised-dad-handbook/.\">http://theparentingpit.com/unschooling/unauthorised-dad-handbook/.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, but my problem lies in my husband who, unfortunately was not able to come to the HENA conference with me.
