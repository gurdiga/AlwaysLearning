They don&#39;t say they are <br/>\ndoing that, but I remember himdoing similar things and recording them in How <br/>\nChildren Fail or How Children Learn. Anyhow, the article is How Babies Think <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-babies-think\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-babies-think</a> for the intro <br/>\nand an option to buy the rest) and it&#39;s in the July 2010 issue of Scientific <br/>\nAmerican and I&#39;m just going to type out the bit that I thought was so cool: <br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\nIn other recent research my group found that young children who think they are <br/>\nbeing instructed modify their statistical analyses and may become less creative <br/>\nas a result. The experimenter showed four-year-olds a toy that would play music <br/>\nif you performed the right sequence of actions on it, such as pulling a handle <br/>\nand then squeezing a bulb. For some children, the experimenter said, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how this toy works--let&#39;s figure it out.&quot; She proceeded to try out various <br/>\nlonger action sequences for the children, some that ended with the short <br/>\nsequence and made music and some that did not. When she asked the children to <br/>\nmake the toy work, many of them tried the correct short sequence, astutely <br/>\nomitting actions that were probably superfluous based on the statistics of what <br/>\nthey had seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith other children, the experimenter said that she would teach them how the toy <br/>\nworked by showing them sequences that did and did not produce music, and then <br/>\nshe acted on the toy in exactly the same way. When asked to make the toy work, <br/>\nthese children never tried a shortcut. Instead they mimicked the entire sequence <br/>\nof actions. Were these children ignoring the statistics of what they say? <br/>\nPerhaps not--their behavior is accurately described by a Bayesian model in which <br/>\nthe &quot;teacher&quot; is expected to choose the most instructive sequences. In simple <br/>\nterms: if she knew shorter sequences worked, she would not have them the <br/>\nunnecessary actions. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what they&#39;ve found is that taking on the role of <br/>\nshe-who-holds-all-the-knowledge shuts down any tendency someone else has to <br/>\nexplore other means of using the item. I know I&#39;ve done that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55995,"nextTopicId":56343}}
