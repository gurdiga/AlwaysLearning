Sandra!!!<br/>\nBAN HIM!!!

It turned out two <br/>\nfamilies had done so--both homeschooling families she knows, with kids she <br/>\nhas played make-believe and dress-up with.   So they knew her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured it was scammish and too weird, but her dad was a frustrated <br/>\nactor/performer type of guy whose parents never supported him much.  And on <br/>\nthe other hand, Holly likes auditions.  She&#39;s gotten a couple of callbacks <br/>\nfor musicals, and tries out for things she doesn&#39;t even really want to be in <br/>\njust because she enjoys the auditioning.  (Weird, I know--like she craves the <br/>\ncompetition I&#39;m trying to avoid for her, at least she enjoys it in short and <br/>\noptional bursts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this and that leads to her being in classes for a year, as of March.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she has had incidents with two teachers who thought she should be reading <br/>\nbetter.  But this morning I talked to the #2,  young, mother of an 18 month <br/>\nold baby, teacher who had made Holly cry last week.  So I arranged for her to <br/>\nhave the packet I had made up for three others there, and she read it.  It <br/>\nwas a two page letter (which I might have posted here, I put most of it <br/>\nsomewhere in public, here or unschooling.com maybe), and a copy of the <br/>\ninverview Emily Subler did with me in HEM a few years back, and copies of a <br/>\ncouple of recent columns about Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the teacher was EFFUSIVELY apologetic, enthusiastic, wanted to know more <br/>\nabout it for her son, etc.  Cool!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, I was out proselytizing while Joyce was bravely keeping this list <br/>\nclean for unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7108,"nextTopicId":7183}}
