It seems that for some\nof these adults the diagnosis helps them finally make sense of things that had\nperplexed them their whole lives, as if the pieces were finally fitting\ntogether. So is this a result of the effects of schooling (assuming these\nadults probably went to school as children)?

I didn’t know it had been undone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany psychological practices are to help people fit in.  And people NEED to fit in, in order to function with others.  A person’s parents can’t guarantee they will live long enough to let the child stay with them his entire life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if and when a person decides to look for a psychologist, one thing to listen/look for is “cognitive therapy.”  Rather than tell your life’s history and “be in analysis” for years (which is also falling out of style or practice, I think), a cognitive therapist will help you see how your thinking is tripping you up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s what we do in this discussion all the time, but we’re aiming it at what ideas and language get between someone and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turns out (in retrospect it’s clear, though 20 years ago, it wasn’t foreseen), becoming a better unschooler involves becoming a better person.  Becoming a better person (more analytical, compassionate, patient) helps people in areas of life besides unschooling.  But that’s all about the parents, and not the children.  Parents can’t “teach” a child to be a good person.  But they can become good examples, and better guides, partners and advisors, so that over ten or twenty years, the children have access to the parents’ clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming the sort of person you hope your child will be, or that your child will respect, is more valuable than years of therapy.  And it’s cheaper. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child needs physical therapy, that might be different, though some parents learn those skills, too, when they have a child who needs special care or specialized skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Labels and their aftermath","postDate":"1453063563","msgId":76545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDREMUY0NkYyLUI1Q0MtNDQyQi05MTcwLTM4MUI5RTM1QjBBMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG43Z251bisxczJqYjk5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG43YmFvZSsxMzBodmJxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEQ1MjM1MDE0LTIzMzctNDZGQi04QTdCLTQ1QjVEMkI3Njc2NUB5YWhvby5jb20+IDxFRDM3RTJCRS00RDY5LTRGMTAtOTVDQi0xNUMzQjBGODVCRjhAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxuN2RsaWMrcDVhOGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTUxRkMwRkQtMDA3My00RDUwLTgyRkUtOUVFNEJBQzY2RjBEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bjdnNGh1KzFyZ3R2aEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxuN2dudW4rMXMyamI5OUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76544,"nextInTopic":76546,"prevInTime":76544,"nextInTime":76546,"topicId":76534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-the list Sandra has of counsellors that get unschooling would be a good bet, if necessary.-=- If it would help, but I don’t think it’s needed in this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-693993778\">-=-the list Sandra has of counsellors that get unschooling would be a good bet, if necessary.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it would help, but I don’t think it’s needed in this instance.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think of a career, and of what “intelligences” it needs, and whether I (or someone else I’m thinking of) would be qualified or good at it.

As I did with my own personal challenges. Currently I’ve read very little, just enough research to know where I feel we are, I haven’t really needed to up till now. I have though ordered 3 books on Aspergers, 1 specifically aimed at girls and one titled ‘All Cats Have Aspergers&#39;. Pema adores cats, always has, always will. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be great to totally personalize it for her, yourself, gradually and just as much as she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you ask whether a psychologist is necessary, think of what a psychologist could do for her.  Is there “therapy” for Asperger’s?  I think just attempts to untangle messes made by school and mean friends and failure to compete (in school, or werever).  If you’re shielded her from damaging environs, maybe that’s not what she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it seems that Asperger’s creates a long, long runway for those kids to get non-verbal social information.  It doesn’t mean they never will, but they might get it at 16, 18 years old instead of at 10 or 12.  Treating it as a lifelong “disability” doesn’t help, and I think it’s false.  They might not ever be as facile as someone born with the maximum possible social potential.  But few people have the maximum.  I don’t.  Kirby is the best in our family for social skills, and yet he doesn’t see much value in dressing well or shaving. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty was younger, I said many times in discussion like this (behind his back) that he would’ve been dyslexic, on a school schedule.  When he was older, 16 or so (?) he overheard me mention something and asked about it.  I said yeah, but so was my dad and so was HIS dad (Keith  my husband), and it came very often with whatever causes left-handedness and an ease with math and spatial.  With puzzles, Marty’s a whiz–those nine-piece puzzles where all the edges need to match, that I can NEVER do (I give up after ten or fifteen minutes), Marty has always worked in less than a minute.  He liked them, but they were too expensive to get for him, since he played with them for 30 seconds and was done. :-)  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by the time he knew there was a label he would have had in school, he already could read and write well, which he figured out in his own way.   EVERY SINGLE PERSON does it in his or her own way.  So with unschooling, if “behind” or “slow” are not factors, then everyone’s feeling confident, ideally, sometimes, when we’re lucky.  I would aim for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Labels and their aftermath","postDate":"1452961731","msgId":76539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZCM0NEM0ZGLTJDMTQtNEY0My05RTFGLUFBRjk3MzkyQjFDMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG43ZGxpYytwNWE4ZEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG43YmFvZSsxMzBodmJxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEQ1MjM1MDE0LTIzMzctNDZGQi04QTdCLTQ1QjVEMkI3Njc2NUB5YWhvby5jb20+IDxFRDM3RTJCRS00RDY5LTRGMTAtOTVDQi0xNUMzQjBGODVCRjhAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxuN2RsaWMrcDVhOGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76538,"nextInTopic":76540,"prevInTime":76538,"nextInTime":76540,"topicId":76534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For one aspect of general discussions of the differences in people’s talents or perceptions, maybe you could print out and play around with her with a list","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-495573548\">For one aspect of general discussions of the differences in people’s talents or perceptions, maybe you could print out and play around with her with a list of Gardner’s intelligences.<br/>\nTalking about which family members, or friends, or fictional characters, seem to have a lot or a little of which ones might be a way to keep it from seeming “wrong” or clinical or pathological.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a> has lists and chitchat about it, my descriptions as might apply to unschoolers, but the basic list is<br/>\n<br/>\nVisual/spatial intelligence<br/>\nMusical intelligence<br/>\nVerbal/linguistic intelligence<br/>\nLogical/mathematical intelligence<br/>\nInterpersonal intelligence<br/>\nIntrapersonal intelligence<br/>\nBodily/kinesthetic intelligence<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus Nature intelligence (categorization of nuts and bolts, parts, similarities and differences—not  just birds and trees, but heraldry, or trucks)<br/>\nPlus maybe Spiritual/Metaphysical/Religious (people are still looking at that) <br/>\n<br/>\nKid-friendly version (I didn’t write it, but I like it):<br/>\n<br/>\nword smart <br/>\nlogic smart <br/>\nmusic smart <br/>\nbody smart <br/>\npicture smart <br/>\npeople smart <br/>\nself smart <br/>\nnature smart<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":563602843,"authorName":"","from":"tarsha.email@...","profile":"natarsha","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Labels and their aftermath","postDate":"1452956044","msgId":76538,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG43ZGxpYytwNWE4ZEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEVEMzdFMkJFLTRENjktNEYxMC05NUNCLTE1QzNCMEY4NUJGOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG43YmFvZSsxMzBodmJxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEQ1MjM1MDE0LTIzMzctNDZGQi04QTdCLTQ1QjVEMkI3Njc2NUB5YWhvby5jb20+CTxFRDM3RTJCRS00RDY5LTRGMTAtOTVDQi0xNUMzQjBGODVCRjhAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76537,"nextInTopic":76539,"prevInTime":76537,"nextInTime":76539,"topicId":76534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are currently at some cross-roads with labelling in our family.

Reading about the OP’s concerns and\nAlex’s responses has been very insightful and thought provoking.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">For several years I have been\naware that my eldest, now 13 would have been labelled with something if she\nwere in school, as the years go on, I would lean toward that label being\nAspergers.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">I avoided a formal diagnosis and\nworked around her needs – staying home a lot, supporting her interests which are\nall on a PC, including researching many topics and especially digital drawing,\nshe gamed most days for several years as well, still games now, just far less,\navoiding loud and crowded places for long periods of time and pre-planning most\noutings. I didn’t really realise initially that she may be ‘eligible for\ndiagnosis’ as living our Radical Unschooling life, respecting the child was in\nthe forefront of our decisions. As the years went on, I started to see that she\nhad difficulties that weren’t the norm and that was ok, especially as she wasn’t\nat school and could do things at her own pace.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Recently she has been expressing\nthat she feels ‘not good enough’ and questioning her own behaviour, she sees\nherself as being different from most others, likely has for a long time if not\nsince the get go, it’s just becoming a concern for her now. I’d never\nconsidered that the label/diagnosis may help her understand herself\nemotionally. What I see/feel is that for the longest time not labelling her was\nbeneficial as we avoided outside pressures and extra support as it’s called yet\nover the past few months since Pema has been questioning herself, it seems that\nnot seeking a diagnosis is possibly going to cause her harm.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">It made me recollect 20 years ago\nwhen I thought I was crazy. It turned out, after another anxiety/panic attack\nand trip to the doctor that I had acute manic depression/bipolar and ocd\ntendencies… I never attached myself to those labels and worked personally to\novercome my challenges, but I did have a huge sigh of relief in knowing that\nthere was something explainable happening within me and I wasn’t actually going\ncrazy after all. I could understand myself and then I could help myself. A few\ntrips to psychologists and medication didn’t take and I was fortunate enough to\nbe able to work through it all (albeit over several tumultuous years) myself.\n(Coming back to this/psychologist option further on as this has made me think\nof something else).</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">We have visited our doctor to get\na referral. Our doctor is someone I know personally and trust and has referred\nus to the psychologist, another lady who she feels would be a good fit knowing\nour family. The appointment has yet to be scheduled when the psych is back for\nearly February.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">I explained to our doctor that I was\nconcerned primarily for Pema’s emotional well-being, she understood that and\nchose an avenue apart from the government options which I think are more\nclosely linked to the type of support they look at when children are in school.</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Over the years I have always\nreassured Pema and accepted her quirks, most of which aren’t ever even\nmentioned within our family as most are aware or at least accept that I don’t\nfuss over things so they don’t/won’t as I’m not generally the one in the family\nthey would try and force their opinions onto, knowing I would do things my way\nanyway. </font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">I would love to hear from other\nparents, Alex again as well with thoughts on what I have shared and how I could\nbest help Pema. </font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Pema seemed to handle our\ndiscussion of her possibly being on the spectrum quite well. She even said she\nwas curious and felt knowing would make her feel better. Perhaps this is where\nI jump back to the psychologist point. Is it enough to read some books and take\nwhat I feel will help? As I did with my own personal challenges. Currently I’ve\nread very little, just enough research to know where I feel we are, I haven’t\nreally needed to up till now. I have though ordered 3 books on Aspergers, 1 specifically\naimed at girls and one titled ‘All Cats Have Aspergers&#39;. Pema adores\ncats, always has, always will. </font><span style=\"font-family:Wingdings;\"><span style=\"\"><font size=\"3\">J</font></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">The small research I have done I\nhave sourced from Tony Attwood and online from women with Aspergers. Many of\nthese women have said they present quite differently to their male counterparts\nand although professionals know about Aspergers, they don’t always understand\nit as well as needed at times to be of sufficient help. So I am looking forward\nto reading more from these women. </font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Perhaps a psychologist is\nunnecessary. I know that I want to stay away from intervention, I just want\nPema to know that there isn’t anything wrong with her, that there are reasons for\nwhy she can behave in certain ways and that we can seek help if needed in\ncoping and strategizing perhaps with things she feels she needs assistance with\nor where I see may need help with. I feel quite ill-equipped to do this solo\npresently and that could be because I haven’t researched much…</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">On a side as well, I do feel it\nwill help with her family relationships, especially her sister, so her sister\nknows that Pema doesn’t like cuddles etc… for a reason, that it isn’t her, no\nmatter how many times I tell Bella it’s not her, that Pema is Pema and we are\nall different, she still internalises it to some degree as it will come up 6\nmonths even a year or 2 later after a particular incident… I also feel it would\nhelp with other extended family as well as they have been critical over the\nyears and find it hard to accept Pema at times for how she can be. I am also\ncurious to know about what adverse effects sharing a diagnosis has had with\nfamily etc… as I can see that it could backfire as was stated… I’m just hoping\nthat because of Pema’s age, we are out of that danger zone whereby they could\ntry and force some form of external ‘help’… </font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">This is quite long winded, my\napologies. I also hope that it is line with helping someone else on this list,\nat least the feedback. I hope I’m conveying my thoughts and again would greatly\nappreciate further input into this subject.</font></p><p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Natarsha</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Labels and their aftermath","postDate":"1452918863","msgId":76537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVEMzdFMkJFLTRENjktNEYxMC05NUNCLTE1QzNCMEY4NUJGOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ1MjM1MDE0LTIzMzctNDZGQi04QTdCLTQ1QjVEMkI3Njc2NUB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG43YmFvZSsxMzBodmJxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEQ1MjM1MDE0LTIzMzctNDZGQi04QTdCLTQ1QjVEMkI3Njc2NUB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76535,"nextInTopic":76538,"prevInTime":76536,"nextInTime":76538,"topicId":76534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Alex wrote: -=-Some people go to school, have Special Ed for many years , have labels and they still cannot do things they way they are supposed to .
