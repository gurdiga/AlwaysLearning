The issue is empowering <br/>\nour children to discern their specific needs such as to &#39;challenge <br/>\nthemselves academically&#39;, &#39;social outlet&#39;, &#39;shared interests&#39;, &#39;more <br/>\nresponsibilities&#39;, &#39;separation from other siblings for periods of <br/>\ntime&#39;, &#39;desires to explore new interests&#39;, &#39;apprentice <br/>\nopportunities&#39;, &#39;evaluation of their knowledge&#39;, &#39;ability to fit <br/>\nin&#39;, &#39;desire to be a part of the community&#39;, &#39;desire to grow without <br/>\nparental influence&#39;, etc. Develop and facilitate means of meeting <br/>\nthose *real needs* in a consensual manner that doesn&#39;t include the <br/>\nnegative aspects of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, David Albert&#39;s book &quot;And The Skylark Sings For Me&quot; talks <br/>\nof community based learning. Apprenticeships are a possibility to <br/>\nexplore to meet many of the above needs. Developing social gatherings <br/>\nfor your community based on similar interests is hard work but can be <br/>\ncultivated. The responsibilities of younger children can certainly <br/>\ninfringe on the parent&#39;s ability to meet the social and intellectual <br/>\nneeds of older children. Other adults can be sought to facilitate <br/>\ninterests of their children without succumbing to school as the &quot;why <br/>\nnot give it a try&quot; alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can conceptualize no inherently constructive benefit that is unique <br/>\nto school that can not be discovered, developed or demonstrated <br/>\nwithin the *real community* rather than the authoritarnian B.S. that <br/>\nschool entails. To conclude otherwise seems short-sighted at best and <br/>\ndisingenuous at worst. The effort needed to provide our children with <br/>\nthe tools to meet their needs must be modelled by us for them to <br/>\nlearn to problem solve outside the box. Otherwise, why not just send <br/>\nthem to the &quot;school box&quot; in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in Chicago, and speaking in the morning.
