I&#39;m feeling much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a request for field trip ideas on a local list and got lots <br/>\nof good ones.  I ordered some butterfly chrysalises.  We plan on <br/>\nstarting an international lunch get together with another homeschool <br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general I feel like I have some focus and that it is fine if I do <br/>\nthe learning and introduce my kids to what I&#39;ve learned.  It will <br/>\nenrich their lives in some way even if it is just the fact that I <br/>\ncared enough to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to worry about the fact that they don&#39;t have the focus <br/>\n(yet or never will?).  I will still be making a happy, stimulating <br/>\nenvironment for them to grow in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5775,"nextTopicId":5897}}
