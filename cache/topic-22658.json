I&#39;ve given the beginning (purpose) and the <br/>\nend (grading).   The blog is the classwork, the project, the class participation <br/>\nand the final.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Statement of Purpose for the Blog Project<br/>\n<br/>\n Several biblical authors and subjects sought to improve dramatically the <br/>\nworlds in which they lived. Similarly, this project asks you to make the world a <br/>\nbetter place by identifying a problem and implementing a solution. Along the <br/>\nway, you will reflect on how various biblical and non-biblical authors have <br/>\naddressed similar issues. Additionally, in keeping with course goals, this <br/>\nproject seeks to improve your ability to think critically and to improve your <br/>\nwriting. Your blog (an abbreviation for web log) will provide a published <br/>\ndocumentation of your thoughts, efforts, and means by which you personally improved the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWeek 14: Blog your thoughts on what your grade for this project should be and <br/>\nwhy. Here are the criteria:<br/>\n<br/>\n A = Nearly everyone in the class would agree that the project considerably <br/>\nimproved the world. Well written blogs documented the extensive work that went <br/>\ninto this project.<br/>\nB = Blogged more than 1000 words every week. Quality writing was free from <br/>\ngrammatical errors. Project had a large scope and lasting duration.<br/>\nC = Blogged 1000 words every week. Spelling and grammar had occasional <br/>\nproblems. Project contained much theory about what student would do, but little <br/>\nconcrete action that the student did do. Project scope was not very broad, and the <br/>\nproject&#39;s duration might be short lived.<br/>\nD = Blogged less than 1000 words every week. Every blog had grammatical <br/>\nproblems. Project had little scope and short-lived duration.<br/>\nF = Rarely blogged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22642,"nextTopicId":22637}}
