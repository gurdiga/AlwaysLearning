We spoke to dd in advance to see if it would be ok with her<br/>\nof course.  We waited until dd was very sound asleep then used a product<br/>\ncalled Farouk Shine. (It is very expensive - I understand there is an off<br/>\nbrand that works just as well) We saturated the rats nests with the silky,<br/>\noily product then teased out the knots one or two hairs at a time.  The<br/>\nknots slip out more or less easily but we must work SLOWLY and gently.  The<br/>\nnext morning, the hair is smooth enough for dd to comb or brush herself.<br/>\nShe very much prefers a soft bristle brush .  I didn&#39;t think that kind of<br/>\nbrush would do anything but it works for her and no longer hurts.  After<br/>\nsome success at this, she was more open to washing and conditioning her hair<br/>\nregularly which helps immensely.  also, trimming the ends so they are even<br/>\nhelped a bit.  If she&#39;s really enjoying her conditioner in the tub she might<br/>\neven let me braid it afterwards .  Every easy, smooth success she has leads<br/>\nto more trust and more desire to take care of her hair.  I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nthought this was possible just a year ago.  She used to walk around with<br/>\nterrible knots all the time.  I&#39;d pull it back into a pony tail or put it in<br/>\na bun knots and all because she wouldn&#39;t let a comb or brush near her.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221621987,"authorName":"HollyOak7@aol.com","from":"HollyOak7@...","profile":"hollyoak7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] dreadlocks ?????","postDate":"1129266484","msgId":23235,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNC42YjA1NTc1MS4zMDgwOTczNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23232,"nextInTopic":23236,"prevInTime":23234,"nextInTime":23236,"topicId":23203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/13/2005 8:53:52 A.M.

I have long curly hair (currently at my  <br/>\nwaist--2 years ago it was at my knees).  If I use a brush on my hair, it  turns <br/>\ninto a big huge frizzy tangly split-ends (did I mention frizzy)  mess.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s a difference in humidity -- I live on the coast in the south  <br/>\nwhere it is very humid all the time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do the same thing Gianna (did I spell that right?) does:<br/>\n <br/>\nI never ever ever use a brush on it.<br/>\nI never ever ever comb it except when it&#39;s wet and loaded with  conditioner.  <br/>\nI never comb it between shampoos or wet-downs.<br/>\nI use either a plastic pick or a very widely-spaced and wide-toothed  comb.<br/>\nI wash it once or twice a week.  I never scrub it &quot;around in circles&quot;,  just <br/>\nback and forth to keep it from getting more tangly.<br/>\nRinse out the shampoo and load it up with conditioner (but not so much  <br/>\ndirectly on my scalp or it gets oily too fast).<br/>\nLet the conditioner &quot;soak in&quot; for at least 5 minutes (while I wash the rest  <br/>\nof me).<br/>\nComb out starting at the bottom of a very small section, working my way all  <br/>\nthe way to my scalp, then begin with another section.  Be sure to hold the  <br/>\nhair just above where the come is, so that the pulling doesn&#39;t pull at the  <br/>\nscalp.  When I get all the tangles out, I comb through the whole thing,  then very <br/>\ncarefully rinse some of the conditioner out.  Then comb it out  one more <br/>\ntime, squeeze the excess water out carefully, get more water out by  using a towel <br/>\nto sop it out, then let it air dry.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy curly-girl niece (13) uses the same technique.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy curly-girl daughter (4) has ringlets to her waist.  I wash it  every 10 <br/>\ndays to 2 weeks (it gets wet lots in between, but I only use shampoo  <br/>\noccasionally, and never comb it unless it is wet and has conditioner in  it.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI use the same technique on her hair, only I do it in the tub, and distract  <br/>\nher (telling silly stories, giving her some bubble stuff, etc) while I  <br/>\nde-tangle.  I have to be flexible about moving around with her to be able  to reach <br/>\nthe part of the hair I&#39;m trying to work on, and if she&#39;s had enough, I  quit.  <br/>\nSometimes just taking a break and playing in the water with her for  a few <br/>\nminutes allows me to go back to it afterwards.  If not, I don&#39;t worry  about it. <br/>\n The next time I start working first on those sections I missed  the last <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it starts to get matted in the back or has some lint or something  stuck <br/>\nin it, I tell her she has a knot,show it to her if it&#39;s towards the  ends, and <br/>\nask if she wants me to get it out.  Usually she says yes, so  I work on it one <br/>\nhair at a time until it comes out.  (She does this for me,  too.)  If she <br/>\nsays no, sometimes I do it while she&#39;s sleeping, or at least  work on it a bit.  <br/>\n(She doesn&#39;t do this to me, as far as I know :))<br/>\n <br/>\nMy mother&#39;s hair was fine, straight as a stick, and short.  She  spent my <br/>\nwhole childhood fighting with my hair, with me over my hair (she wanted  it to be <br/>\nshort; I wanted long), complaining about it, practically yanking it out  of <br/>\nmy head when she combed or brushed it (because she wanted it to be  neat).  She <br/>\nalways seemed to be angry at it, and at me.  It took me  more than 30 years <br/>\nto get to the point that I LOVE my hair, the freedom of it,  its individuality, <br/>\nits insistence on doing its own thing ... and I celebrate  those same <br/>\nqualities in my daughter&#39;s hair.

It is a leave in treatment/conditioner.  I use quite a bit, apply it to wet hair and mix it through.  You can get it in a spray, but I find that it takes forever.  The refill bottles have a squirt top, and I just squirt it into my hair.  After it has been mixed in, tangles are pretty easy to get out, and more can be applied to tough ones.  The other thing that has worked for me is to water down regular conditioner and use that.  You can get one that smells really good and it works pretty well on tangles.  The only drawback is hair can have a dull look to it, but if it makes her life easier it would probably be worth it.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nKaty J.

I have personal experience with!  I have very curly long hair also (nearly to my waist when it is wet - a few inches below the shoulder when dry).  I normally only wash my hair  every 2nd or third day or even 4th day.  I NEVER EVER comb it dry -  I cannot even begin to imagine how painful it would be :(   Even when my children were little and wanted to &quot;do&quot; my hair, I would have to go and wet and condition it first. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is what I do:  <br/>\n-I wash and then highly condition my hair.  <br/>\n-I then begin to detangle from the bottom using a very wide-toothed comb.    <br/>\n-I rinse the conditioner out (I shed quite a bit) and recomb it to keep it tangle free.  <br/>\n-I then pour a large handful of conditioner into my hand and put it back in my hair- a lot!! .  -I then &#39;shake&#39; my hair out gently letting only the excess conditioner come out.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI normally just let it dry naturally at that point.  I sometimes add a little more conditioner if needed as it dries.  <br/>\nOccasionally, if I want to straighten it out a bit and I think this would work best with your daughter, I braid it.  <br/>\nI also often just &#39;re-wet&#39; my hair and add more conditioner if I need to comb it or de-tangle it - this can be done watching TV and detangling from the bottom.   <br/>\nWhen I have really gotten my hair tangled up or knotted - I don&#39;t even bother to wet it -- I just slather it with conditioner on the really bad tangles and let it sit for a bit and &#39;loosen up&#39; and work it out before even getting in the shower.  I normally wear my hair down (After 40 years, I have finally come to love my curls :) , but if I don&#39;t want to bother with it the next day - I will manage to pull apart my hair into 3 sections, yup - add more conditioner - and braid it.  The next morning, I take it out, spritz it or  wet it down and its &#39;refreshed&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - When my daughter was little and had hair to her bottom (slightly wavy only), I would always put a lot of conditioner into her hair and braid it prior to going to the beach or pool and it would protect her hair from the chlorine and salt and we would undo the braid and use the poolside shower and her hair was never tangled or damaged and all of the sand would come out.  I am obviously a big conditioner freak - LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - I use an inexpensive conditioner to keep in my hair - VO5.  It is around $1 a bottle and contains collagen (good for my hair), it comes in many scents  and I often get compliments on my perfume - LOL!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep a lot of conditioner in my hair *at all times* but you may need to experiment to see how much will keep hair manageable and not have it too &#39;flat or dull&#39;.  I have never found any advertised &#39;leave in conditioner&#39; or detangler to work as well as VO5 other than FrizzEase (but that is kind of pricey for me - as I need to use A LOT) or Paul Mitchell&#39;s styling pomade but I usually need the weight of the conditioner to keep my hair calm. I live in Orlando FL -- lots of humidity!!  Sometimes I use a combination of conditioner and gel if I need additional control or want it in a particular style.  And Biosilk&#39;s silk therapy to keep the &#39;flyaways&#39; down. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope that some of this helped.

Really, everything but the curly<br/>\nhair.  What my solution has been in to detangle the hair, pretty much one<br/>\nstrand of hair at a time, while Nicole is asleep.  It takes a bit of time,<br/>\nbut not any more than the 50 minutes you did last night.  The following day<br/>\nI brush it quickly and it doesn&#39;t hurt because the tangles are gone.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t do this every night, but I do it frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome notes: when Nicole&#39;s hair gets wet it tangles more.  So I have to make<br/>\nsure that I detangle it after she swims.  (Once again, doing it at night.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried only 2 detanglers, and they didn&#39;t work at all really.  They<br/>\nput a nice sheen on the surface of the hair, but the tangles were still<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving Nicole&#39;s hair in braided pigtails helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I do brush starting at the bottom helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse a boar bristle (or similar) brush; it gives across the tangles.  Other<br/>\nbrushes force themselves through the tangles and it hurts a lot more.  It<br/>\ntakes longer to brush this way, with the brush giving more often.  But it&#39;s<br/>\nworth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDitch the idea that you have to brush every day.  You don&#39;t.  But you do<br/>\nhave to pay attention to the tangles.  At one point (the night I figured<br/>\nout the trick of doing it while Nicole was asleep) she was getting a<br/>\ndreadlock in the middle of her head in the back, and she was getting really<br/>\nworried about it.  She really really didn&#39;t want dreadlocks.  I was able to<br/>\nget it all out, but it took several nights.  She was *so* happy when she<br/>\nwoke up and her tangles were gone.  It was great to be able to finally find<br/>\na solution that worked - it brings her such joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be in a hurry and don&#39;t try to do it all at once.  Just do as much as<br/>\nyou can in one sitting, and do try to focus on getting out one strand (or<br/>\nclose to it) of hair pulled out at a time.  For any tangles that are<br/>\nbunched up, I just gently pull on the edges to loosen the tangled area.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf when you do brush and it ends up hurting your dd and she gets mad, don&#39;t<br/>\ntake it personally.  She might feel like it&#39;s your fault that it hurt, and<br/>\nyou may be feeling frustrated about that because you are just trying to<br/>\nfind a way to help her get what she wants w/ her hair.  That&#39;s all OK<br/>\nreally, to let that go.  It hurts, and she&#39;s mad about it.  This is why<br/>\ndoing it at night and doing it one strand at a time helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I can get out smaller tangles during the day if I do the one strand at<br/>\na time technique and if I don&#39;t try to do it all at once.  I will ask<br/>\nthroughout the day if she is ready and once we start she will tell me when<br/>\nshe is done.  In a given week I&#39;d say her hair is perfectly tangle free<br/>\nmaybe 1-2 days.  The rest of the time it&#39;s in various forms of tanglement<br/>\nor braids.  She brushed it all on her own today.  It looks great!  But I<br/>\nexpect it&#39;s a bit tangled toward the ends.... no problem.  I&#39;ll get them in<br/>\nthe next day or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t wash Nicole&#39;s hair with shampoo.  We never have.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nthis matters or not WRT tangles, but it really helps to know that you don&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;have to&quot; wash hair.  It gets wet when Nicole wants it to get wet.<br/>\nOtherwise, it&#39;s just fine.  If you&#39;ve been using shampoo with your dd&#39;s<br/>\nhair, then I suggest cutting back slowly.  Go every other time, then every<br/>\n3rd time, etc...  It will take awhile for her hair to return to it&#39;s normal<br/>\noil balance.  Don&#39;t be worried if it seems more oily at first (that&#39;s what<br/>\nhappened to me when I stopped using shampoo, but eventually the natural<br/>\nbalance is restored.  The hair just needs to de-shampoo, that&#39;s all ;-)<br/>\nSince you say that your dd doesn&#39;t want to wash her hair then this approach<br/>\nwill help you get to that place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never cut Nicole&#39;s hair, except for accidents or experiments where<br/>\nshe&#39;s cut off a tiny bit on the ends.  She&#39;s almost 7 and her hair is down<br/>\nto her butt.  She plans on growing it down to her calves or ankles and<br/>\nkeeping it that long.  She doesn&#39;t want to trip on it while she walks!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was *SOOOO* happy when I discovered the night time routine.  So was<br/>\nNicole.  Before then I was so frustrated because it seemed that the<br/>\nsituation was impossible.

It tangled badly...<br/>\nOne thing I did was keep it in braids a lot. She didn&#39;t mind having it braided, and it kept it from tangling. I would wash it, condition in, and then immediately braid it while it was still wet. She slept in the braids, kept them in for a couple of days usually... french braids were best for this.<br/>\nI also combed through it in the tub, with the conditioner still in it, with a wide-toothed comb. That seemed to help, too. Other people have recommended the Johnson&#39;s No More Tangles spray. Some of the newer shampoos and conditioners are great at not tangling, too - I think the new Dove shampoo and conditioners have something in them that prevents tangling.<br/>\nWhen you have to detangle, make sure you start from the bottom and work up. You can also hold the hair above where you&#39;re working, to keep it from pulling at the head. That way there&#39;s no possibility of pulling except for the very top part. We always watched videos during this, too, or else she played computer games, so she had some distraction.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/freeformlife\">http://www.xanga.com/freeformlife</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-- &quot;The Millers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willowsfortress@...\">willowsfortress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nQuestion....<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the facts:<br/>\n<br/>\n-7 year old daughter<br/>\n-likes her long hair (about 3/4 down back)<br/>\n-does not want to comb hair (too hard)<br/>\n-does not want us (mom and dad) to comb hair (hurts)<br/>\n-does not want to wash hair<br/>\n-has very curly, tangle-prone hair<br/>\n-cannot wash hair on own, so mama washes once per week<br/>\n-last night it took 50 minutes to comb out<br/>\n-daughter upset at time spent to comb out and at pain (uggg, that sounds<br/>\nsooo aweful...but both dad and I tried our hardest to be sooo gentle), but<br/>\n-she does not want dread locks (we did consider this option of forgoing the<br/>\nwhole wash, comb thing...showed her a picture and she says, NO WAY!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe (the three of us) talked about it and think that we have come up with a<br/>\nplan, but I told Sorscha we would ask a group of women who might possibly<br/>\ngive us more options.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what we came up with.<br/>\n<br/>\n-mama is going to go out and find as many options for the best, detangling<br/>\nshampoo and conditioner on the market<br/>\n<br/>\n-daddy is going to take daughter to salon once per week to have them wash,<br/>\nspecial treatment, and comb out (taking us out of the picture?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sorscha is going to attempt to comb to the best of her ability<br/>\n<br/>\nSoooo, we do not want to use the famous parent line, &quot;If you don&#39;t keep your<br/>\nhair up, we&#39;re going to cut it&quot; (we would never say this to her) and we do<br/>\nnot want there to be any division with our relationships because of this.<br/>\nShe does not want dreadlocks.
