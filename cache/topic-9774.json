I can&#39;t believe it went so fast.  <br/>\nI was out yesterday cleaning up the garden.  I found an enormous zucchini<br/>\nI&#39;d somehow missed.  I brought in the rosemary and some other things I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t bear to leave to winter.  Today it&#39;s forty degrees and windy and<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel much like working.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went bird watching this morning but the cold and my sore leg brought<br/>\nus home before very long.  So now I&#39;m sitting listening to bird songs,<br/>\nthis sounds more than a little obsessive I know, and answering e-mail. <br/>\nDylan doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s cold so he&#39;s playing outside.  Every once in a<br/>\nwhile I see the top of his red hat bob past the window.   My little dog<br/>\nis wondering what all these eerie sounds are, he&#39;s apparently never hear<br/>\na loon before nor the pig like grunting of pelicans. ( or was that me<br/>\neating cookies?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Montana DOL killed three bison today that wandered out of Yellowstone<br/>\npark.  This isn&#39;t a political list so I won&#39;t climb on my soap box, but<br/>\nit&#39;s disheartening to say the least.  While the bitterns are gurgling<br/>\nmaybe I&#39;ll e-mail my stinking governor and give her what for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is with Great Egret that I sign off  (oh, man!  Bad bird humor.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9764,"nextTopicId":9765}}
