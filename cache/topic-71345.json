Parents unschool by the environment they create for their kids to learn in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The first, and most prominent is called Radical Unschooling,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if prominent is read as &quot;loudest&quot; perhaps. ;-) Radical unschoolers are just a small segment of the broader group who call themselves unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe regular unschoolers are more numerous. They run the gamut from helping their children explore freely to helping their children find the classes and projects the kids enjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the radical unschoolers *talk* a lot more about unschooling than regular unschoolers because applying this philosophy of learning to all of life involves letting go of a lot of baggage around what children need to learn and grow. And rooting out and eradicating baggage can take a great deal of discussion and reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where children make ever decision for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Clearer is that choice is valued as a primary avenue for learning. So children are supported in and given a great deal of choice in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a radical unschooled home, there are no rules, no schedules, no guidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Clearer is in a radical unschooling home principles are emphasized, not rules. Rather than &quot;Don&#39;t hit your sister,&quot; the focus is on finding ways to meet needs that are kind, respectful, safe, doable and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers have very scheduled days :-) There are no *arbitrarily imposed* schedules. Days are scheduled around the children&#39;s activities and daily living so things can get done. Some families live with very loose schedules. Personality and need determine how much the days are scheduled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t guide*lines* but there is guidance. If kids aren&#39;t meeting their needs in a kind, respectful way, Mom is there to sort things out and offer better approaches. Social skills are *much* harder to figure out than rocket science! ;-) Kids need to see negotiations and juggling of needs done lots of times to begin building a working understanding of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Children choose every aspect of their day<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s clearer to say children are given choice. &quot;Children choose&quot; sounds like an unbreakable rule and mom must obey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  It&#39;s not uncommon to find radically unschooled children up at 2 am playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Taken out of the context of parents creating a safe way for kids who are old enough to do stay up late at night, the above will just paint a picture of neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to paint a picture of learning that&#39;s very different than school, maybe: &quot;It&#39;s not uncommon for radically unschooled kids to grow their understanding of math from video games, of history from exploring early baseball, and of social skills from playing Dungeons and Dragons.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The philosophy is that when children are given the freedom to govern themselves, they make better choices than we would think they would.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When kids are supported in making choices they get better and better at making thoughtful choices. The emphasis is away from making the &quot;right&quot; choice and on the natural self reflection of how well a choice worked. Also parents are there to steer kids away from the choices that are hurtful or dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, a child given the freedom to chose whatever he/she wants to eat will often chose junk food - for a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That doesn&#39;t happen with always radically unschooled kids, aside from occasional binges. Though it can happen to a child whose diet has been controlled who is allowed choice. They will often choose to eat a lot of the foods that were limited -- for a time. Once they feel confident those foods won&#39;t be limited again, their diets grow more varied as they&#39;re better able to listen to what their bodies need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It IS allowing your children the freedom to learn what they want, when they&#39;re ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would get rid of &quot;the freedom&quot;. Freedom can paint a picture of free license.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It IS allowing your children the freedom to make their own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It IS supporting your children in making their own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It IS &quot;partner-parenting&quot; - guiding your children, NOT ruling over them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There are some parents that are uncomfortable with the radical form of unschooling, and those parents chose to unschool in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;those parents choose to apply the unschooling philosophy only to academics.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These parents allow their children freedom of choice in what they learn, and do not use any curriculum. The children learn through life experiences, when they&#39;re ready. This is where the similarity ends. This form of unschooling has rules and chores and bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An unschooling family *might* have rules and chores and bedtimes. How much choice the kids are allowed outside of academics will vary from family to family. The parenting may be fairly liberal to fairly conservative.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is still unschooling by educational philosophy, but is not radical, and there is much debate as to weather this is beneficial for the child or not...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are people debating whether radical or regular is better somewhere? I think it&#39;s more a difference of opinion. Since unschoolers and radical unschoolers aren&#39;t fighting over territory, so to speak, it&#39;s easy to ignore each other then let new unschoolers choose for themselves which idea they like. So which camp an unschooler is drawn to depends on how comfortable they are that children can learn the skills they need for life naturally or if they need taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Colleen","from":"Colleen &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Need Input On A Blog Post Explaining Unschooling","postDate":"1367420874","msgId":71348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCRjdGQjM0LTVDRkMtNEIxOS05RkY5LURGQkU5NjVENTkwNkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtscjE3ayt0ODBhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtscjE3ayt0ODBhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71347,"nextInTopic":71349,"prevInTime":71347,"nextInTime":71349,"topicId":71345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****Unschooling is child-led learning without a set schedule or curriculum.**** Unschooling is... *Helping your child follow his/her interests and passions,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1682839186\">****Unschooling is child-led learning without a set schedule or curriculum.****<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is... <br/>\n*Helping your child follow his/her interests and passions, out in the Real World.  <br/>\n*Living as if school doesn&#39;t exist (I can&#39;t remember if it was Sandra Dodd or someone else who first said that, but I like it :-)).  <br/>\n*Recognizing that learning can come from a variety of experiences, interactions with people, toys, outings, games, TV shows and movies, video games, etc. - the world is full of learning opportunities, and unschoolers are out in the world (whether the world on a particular day is their own house or backyard or a far away place or anywhere in between) learning all the time!<br/>\n*Being involved with your children, learning alongside them, enjoying them, supporting them, and bringing new materials and opportunities into their lives based on things they like, questions they ask, or interests they express.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not child-led learning, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian wrote about the difference between child-led learning and unschooling:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/\">http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n****Radical Unschooling, where children make ever decision for themselves****<br/>\n****there are no rules, no schedules, no guidelines.****<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 year old does not make every decision for himself.

It has some amazing ideas and affirmations on not only a child&#39;s education, but parenting in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is one of the forerunners in the Unschooling movement, along with Pam Sooroshian, Joyce Fetteroll, Kathy Ward, and others. They all have ideas about what Unschooling is about, and some of them are more radical than others, but they all have the same premise about the basis of what unschooling is:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is child-led learning without a set schedule or curriculum.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not really a good explanation of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two different philosophies in Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first, and most prominent  is called Radical Unschooling, where children make ever decision for themselves. In a radical unschooled home, there are no rules, no schedules, no guidelines. Children choose every aspect of their day from when to get up, to what they&#39;re going to eat, to what they&#39;re going to do that day, and even what time they&#39;re going to bed. It&#39;s not uncommon to find radically unschooled children up at 2 am playing video games. While some parents may look at this and find it harmful, in some families it works quite well. The philosophy is that when children are given the freedom to govern themselves, they make better choices than we would think they would.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a child given the freedom to chose whatever he/she wants to eat will often chose junk food - for a time. But soon, the child will throw in some healthier choices. In my own experience with this, I have given Miss E and Mr. J freedom to chose whatever they want to eat. Sometimes they chose junk, and sometimes they chose healthier foods. As of late, Miss. E has become concerned with weight gain and so has begun to chose healthier options like fruit and vegetables. Mr. J enjoys a wide variety of foods. From what I&#39;ve seen, I am fostering a healthy attitude about food for my children. They don&#39;t obsess over what they&#39;re going to eat all the time, nor do they obsess over one type of food. My children have, on their own, chosen a healthier lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what the idea of Radical Unschooling is about.<br/>\nBut sometimes it can go very, very wrong.<br/>\nThere is a fine line between Radical Unschooling and Neglectful Parenting.<br/>\nSo let me clarify that right now:<br/>\nRadical Unschooling is NOT Neglectful Parenting.<br/>\nIt is NOT allowing your children to go through life unattended.<br/>\nIt is NOT allowing your children to run wild with no parental supervision.<br/>\nIt is NOT &quot;uneducating&quot; your child.<br/>\nIt is NOT consistently sitting at home playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS allowing your children the freedom to learn what they want, when they&#39;re ready.<br/>\nIt IS allowing your children the freedom to make their own choices.<br/>\nIt IS &quot;partner-parenting&quot; - guiding your children, NOT ruling over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some parents that are uncomfortable with the radical form of unschooling, and those parents chose to unschool in a different way. These parents allow their children freedom of choice in what they learn, and do not use any curriculum. The children learn through life experiences, when they&#39;re ready. This is where the similarity ends. This form of unschooling has rules and chores and bedtimes.
