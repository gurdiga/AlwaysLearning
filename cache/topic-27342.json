I could read this much in  <br/>\nwhat showed on a documentary video on YouTube.com   I couldn&#39;t pull  <br/>\nthe address (don&#39;t know why) but if you search for this you can find it:<br/>\nAli G before he was massiv (1/3)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a sarcastic kind of thing about school, and the school he went  <br/>\nto was a fancy all-boys&#39; school in London.  (Maybe even then he was  <br/>\nbeing sarcastic right in other people&#39;s faces and they didn&#39;t fully  <br/>\nperceive it. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My first lesson on Monday  morning is English.  This reminds us of  <br/>\nthe correct way to speak and write English.  This is very important  <br/>\nas most of the boys have been watching television and speaking with  <br/>\ntheir parents all weekend.  By the end of one English lesson, things,  <br/>\nespecially our English, are more or less back to normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our second lesson on Monday is maths.   Maths is my favourite  <br/>\nsubject.  In maths it is a great comfort every Monday that one plus  <br/>\none still equals two.  All types of things may have happened on the  <br/>\nweekend, Russia may have invaded Afghanistan, England may have lost  <br/>\nagainst  the West Indies at cricket and the price of  [something I  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t read] has jumped up, but in maths nothing has changed.
