Maybe some day (maybe sooner than we think &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nlearning will no longer be equated with schooling and even schooling <br/>\nwill no longer mean what it does today - lecturing, testing, imposed <br/>\ncurriculum, grades, assignments, and learning during specific <br/>\nhours/days. Until then, it makes sense to me that we are defined by the <br/>\nfact that we do NOT do those things - we do not do school. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntalk about what we do instead - but that is not what distinguishes us <br/>\nfrom how other people educate their children. My oldest daughter went <br/>\nto school until 4th grade. When she was in school she was schooled, but <br/>\nshe also learned &quot;naturally&quot; - she learned through games and <br/>\nconversation and real life, just like she continued to do, later, as an <br/>\nunschooler. The ONLY difference was that when she was in school she was <br/>\nalso &quot;schooled.&quot; We pulled her out and then she was no longer schooled <br/>\n- hence, she &quot;unschooled.&quot; The natural learning just kept right on <br/>\ngoing, through it all. While it is true that unschooled kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe roadblocks in their natural learning pathways that school sets up, <br/>\nto say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; as if kids in school don&#39;t also learn <br/>\n&quot;naturally,&quot; sets up a false dichotomy. Remember, much of what kids <br/>\nlearn in their lives is learned outside of school, naturally, even in <br/>\nspite of lecturing, grading, homework, assignments, and <br/>\none-size-fits-all curriculum. Even though it takes up far more of their <br/>\nlives than seems healthy to us, school isn&#39;t their ENTIRE life and <br/>\nnatural learning happens in schooled kids lives, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to the question, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the term &#39;natural learning&#39; be <br/>\nmore affirming than the use of the negative in the term &#39;unschooling&#39;?&quot; <br/>\nSuzanne Carter, a poet and homeschooling mom, wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as <br/>\nnegative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me <br/>\nunschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing, <br/>\nunfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is posted on the unschooling.com website, along with a number of <br/>\nother comments and definitions on unschooling, at:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/faq/definitions.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/faq/definitions.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127921172,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;syltoyama@...&gt;","profile":"syltoyama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] (unknown)","postDate":"1078107464","msgId":18873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMzAxMDIxNzQ0LjcxODQyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxNjAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwNDI1OUUzLjMwNjAwMDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":18868,"nextInTopic":18882,"prevInTime":18872,"nextInTime":18874,"topicId":18863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Really?

For example, at our neighborhood park there is a sign that reads No Fishing, No Wading No Swimming at the pond. Actually it&#39;s just a big drainage basin, but it does have fish, ducks and frogs -- it also has a rough concrete finish, and the water is beyond skanky and filthy.  The rule exists for a good reason.  Besides, the entire time they are leaning over the edge looking for fish, I&#39;m truly very worried someone will fall in and be hurt.  I realize it&#39;s obssesive, but it&#39;s one of my genuine phobias, so in that case, I&#39;m glad I can cite the rule and herd them back towards the playground.  Maybe I should more closely examine my motives, and how I respond.<br/>\n <br/>\n   For that matter, it might be best if everyone just discounts much of what I say this weekend -- I&#39;ve just been thru an &#39;encounter&#39; with my Mom where she has AGAIN offered unsolicited advice for how I should be disciplining my children, the many mistakes I&#39;ve made with my oldest (and the current fall-out he&#39;s working thru) adn how I really need to look at my methods and make sure I prevent the same mistakes with the other two....  and I&#39;m a little defensive and scattered right now.

In your first example, the sidewalk has a <br/>\nsign that says no running.  Why is that sign there?  You say it&#39;s an <br/>\nincline, right?  Is it such down hill that if he runs, falling woudl be <br/>\nmore dangerous than just running on another sidewalk?  If so, then I&#39;d <br/>\npoint that out.  Hey, look Janene, there is a sign that says no running <br/>\n(pointing out the sign), I wonder why it says that.  I might take her <br/>\nhand and have a conversation.   In your second example, I think parents <br/>\nhave a responsibility to make sure their children don&#39;t damage property, <br/>\nincluding that in a store.

We learn <br/>\ntogether as a family.  They are the children and Mark and I are the <br/>\nparents. I am not more than they are, nor less, we just are.  We learn <br/>\ntogether, but because I am older, I have learned more, especially, I <br/>\nwould hope, about how life works.  We talk a lot about lots of different <br/>\nthings.  I would like my children to learn through other&#39;s mistakes, and <br/>\nnot just their own.  If they could learn through my mistakes, the ones I <br/>\nmade not just last week but those I made as a child, than that&#39;s be great. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes a child really need to fall and break an arm in order to learn that <br/>\na sign posted on an incline indicating not to run might be something to <br/>\nhead?
