I&#39;m not even suggesting telling him <br/>\nthat this guy is a DANGER. I&#39;m suggesting letting Matthew in on this bit of <br/>\ninformation because I know Matthew and I know Dan and I think Dan&#39;s feeling <br/>\nlike Mathew would appreciate knowing - feel like Dan had held out something <br/>\nfrom him - but that Dan is really not wanting the &quot;golden age&quot; of childhood <br/>\nto end for Matthew. I dont want that either. I care a LOT about Matthew. I <br/>\nthink Matthew could be made aware of it without it being a thing that would <br/>\nassociate horrible ugliness with robotics. I think he is starting ANYWAY to <br/>\nget a sense of how people are complex. He&#39;s learning already that his friends <br/>\nare not perfect - that sometimes he doesn&#39;t really like certain aspects of <br/>\nthem. He also REALLY trusts his dad to bring things to his attention - I sort <br/>\nof think he&#39;d feel a little duped by not being told that his dad has major <br/>\nmisgivings about some guy while pretending to Matthew that the guy is just <br/>\nwonderful. I just don&#39;t think it would be all that awful for Matthew to hear: <br/>\n&quot;Yuck, some people are just so surprising in their weird and STUPID ideas. <br/>\nHere we&#39;ve got this guy who is so brilliant in robotics and so idiotic in <br/>\nthis other belief.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMathew is going to hear this stuff anyway - so I don&#39;t think it matters so <br/>\nmuch whether or not you tell him about THIS.  He&#39;s also going to hear racist <br/>\nand homophobic stuff even from people he cares about, for example. It has <br/>\ngone over his head but it won&#39;t for long. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How much detail do you give a six year old about what could happen to them <br/>\n&gt; if <br/>\n&gt; they get lured into a car by a stranger?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is relevant. Matthew isn&#39;t a 6 yo and we&#39;re not talking <br/>\nabout that kind of stuff. And Dan can use his judgement about how graphic he <br/>\nwants to be about white supremists - not very, I wouldn&#39;t think, not now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Racism won&#39;t be created nor destroyed by Matthew&#39;s awareness.

It is going to <br/>\nupset him.
