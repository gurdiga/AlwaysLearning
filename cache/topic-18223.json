A study showed that kids who have family dinner at least 4 times a week have better social schools, are healthier and apparently happier.  The story went on to say, that if you find you&#39;re too busy to actually cook dinner, it&#39;s okay to pick up something to bring home, but you still really should eat at the table together.   These stories have always rubbed me the wrong way, but I never really thought about why.  We&#39;re not devoted family dinner people -- Gary works late many days, and the boys get hungry before he gets home.  Besides, at the end of the day apart, it&#39;s really nice to have dinner without the kids some days.  With us, it&#39;s more likely to be Friday late dinner, and weekend breakfast.  Gary and I both grew up with family dinner every night -- he as an only child, I as the family cook and housekeeper. <br/>\n Our memories of family dinner aren&#39;t exactly brimming with joy. <br/>\n <br/>\nTonight, I figured out why we&#39;re not dinner devotees.  We don&#39;t have to be!  We spend all kinds of time with the kids.  They sleep with us at least part of the night, we hang out all weekend (no busy soccer weekends here) I&#39;m home with them every day, because they&#39;re not in school, they can stay up late enough to greet Gary when he gets home late.  Who needs a strict dinner routine when you have all day, every day?  Those silly stories are meant for the schoolers who get almost no time with their kids.  Who, as a result of social indoctrination, don&#39;t know how to connect with their kids without instructions from the TV news.  Of course, that&#39;s also the same crowd the commercials about &#39;connect 4 kids.com&#39; pitch to -- yanno, the ones where Mom and Dad grill the kid about SAT questions during dinner, and do stupid puppet shows about Lewis & Clark.  The advertisers -- and other powers that be -- have managed to convince most parents that they aren&#39;t smart enough to care for a pet snail,<br/>\n much less a complicated child!  <br/>\n <br/>\nokay, rant over.... sometimes it just hits me so clearly that I can&#39;t believe others don&#39;t see it!<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I fall on the opposite end<br/>\nof the poster but only recently, as my children have gotten older.  (Now 4<br/>\nand 6)  They wake up and literally play ALL day together until midnight<br/>\neach night.   For the most part, they don&#39;t want me around for it.  When<br/>\nthey do, they ask.  It is not that I am off pursuing my own life, my life<br/>\nused to revolve around having two young kids close together.  Now they just<br/>\nhave their own things to do.  During a typical (really no such thing) day,<br/>\nwe might play a game a cards, read a book, watch a show, help with a<br/>\ncomputer game or go outside together but even with these things the balance<br/>\nof their day is spent just playing with each other or friends.  We are the<br/>\n&#39;fun house&#39; too the one no one wants to leave.  I think it has to do with<br/>\ntheir not being adults hanging over them directing the play and it is just<br/>\na fun space:)  I find when I do interject myself, uninvited, into their<br/>\nplay it changes it and not for the better.   So I really just let them lead<br/>\nthe way and ask for what they need.  I don&#39;t consider this &#39;benevolent<br/>\nneglect&#39; but I wonder if an outsider looking in would .  I think there<br/>\nmight be a perception of they should be &#39;learning&#39; something or be directed<br/>\nmore.  While it has been a strange transition for me (the hands on 24/7<br/>\nlife of toddlers and babies), it has also be amazing watching them learn so<br/>\nmuch and grow and change without intervention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I can&#39;t wait to hear what others think.  On some lists,  I see the<br/>\nhuge lists of exciting &#39;activities&#39; they do with their children on a daily<br/>\nbasis and I wonder if I&#39;m missing the boat but we have a peaceful, happy<br/>\nlife.
