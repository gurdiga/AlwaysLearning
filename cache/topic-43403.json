She gave us some  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nideas.   She loaned us a game that might help with R.   Another speech  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntherapist friend was at a music party we went to and she and Holly  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwent into the kitchen for a while to get food for people and she told  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly a couple of things about the way people&#39;s mouths are shaped on  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe inside and the places tongues touch to make sounds.   Nothing  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndeep; no test; no fingers in the mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Holly thought about it and practiced on her own, and asked me &quot;Does  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;room&#39; have an R in it?&quot;  The best little practice tool she had was  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure.&quot;  She would say that to herself  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsometimes, listening to see if her &quot;r&quot; was getting better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one thing I knew was that if she could read she would have made  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfaster progress.

The methods speech  <br/>\ntherapists use could be used at home, occasionally, maybe for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly didn&#39;t have &quot;r&quot; when she was six or so (maybe seven; the story  <br/>\nwill be in archives somewhere from that time, maybe).   She wanted  <br/>\nspeech therapy.  I said it would come around.    She pressed.  I took  <br/>\na speech therapist friend to dinner and Holly went.  She gave us some  <br/>\nideas.   She loaned us a game that might help with R.   Another speech  <br/>\ntherapist friend was at a music party we went to and she and Holly  <br/>\nwent into the kitchen for a while to get food for people and she told  <br/>\nHolly a couple of things about the way people&#39;s mouths are shaped on  <br/>\nthe inside and the places tongues touch to make sounds.   Nothing  <br/>\ndeep; no test; no fingers in the mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Holly thought about it and practiced on her own, and asked me &quot;Does  <br/>\n&#39;room&#39; have an R in it?&quot;  The best little practice tool she had was  <br/>\n&quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure.&quot;  She would say that to herself  <br/>\nsometimes, listening to see if her &quot;r&quot; was getting better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one thing I knew was that if she could read she would have made  <br/>\nfaster progress.  I also was sure that &quot;faster progress&quot; wasn&#39;t as  <br/>\nimportant to me as her learning to read in her own, natural way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer speech became clear and her reading blossomed, but not right then  <br/>\nthat year.  But she knew then and knows now that with just a little  <br/>\nhelp and with interested friends who will answer her questions, she  <br/>\ncan work things out gradually on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe an occasional visit to a speech therapist (or different ones  <br/>\ndifferent times) every couple of months would help.  Ask them for  <br/>\nideas and tricks, rather than offering to pay them to take  <br/>\nresponsibility for seeing him through to perfection.  That might take  <br/>\nthe pressure off of everyone.   Maybe ask this professor to recommend  <br/>\none or two of his best students who need to make a little money, and  <br/>\ninvite them over just to hang out, play cards or watch movies, and to  <br/>\nmake suggestions you and your son could use on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he feels he did it himself in his own way, it will make other  <br/>\nthings easier in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

Getting him <br/>\nto purse his lips firmly and strengthen those muscles.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some blowing things that my dd, now 9, enjoys very much:<br/>\nBlowing up balloons and then letting them fly around the house and chasing <br/>\nthem.<br/>\nBlowing bubbles through a straw into bubble bath or soap suds (still at 9).<br/>\nBlowing bubbles through a straw into milkshakes (normally frowned upon - <br/>\n:p~~~~)<br/>\nBlowing into a harmonica, kazoo or penny whistle.<br/>\nand yes sometimes blowing paint for the specific purposes of making <br/>\nsomething with those painted textures, at *her* instigation and desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us some of the other exercises. I bet we can come up with at least <br/>\nthree other &quot;just play&quot; activities that our kids enjoy for their own sake, <br/>\nthat your son might find fun and would still be moving the muscles properly, <br/>\nso maybe he need not go for his weekly reminder that he&#39;s still failing at <br/>\nspeaking right.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And for the HARD work of learning<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where the palate is and how to move it, she is doing<br/>\n&gt; things like this:  they each take a blue popsicle and each<br/>\n&gt; use it to paint their own palate blue.  Then they use flashlights<br/>\n&gt; and mirrors to watch as they try to open and close their<br/>\n&gt; palates.  DS is very successful at the actual activities...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it genuinely &quot;hard&quot; work? Or are you being told it is hard work to <br/>\njustify the need for an expert and an expensive series of therapies? Babies <br/>\nlearning to talk don&#39;t learn how to move their palate as a special skill - <br/>\nit is part of making sounds that is automatic and developmental. I wonder <br/>\nhow good it is to be moving the palate in isolation from making sounds. Are <br/>\nyou passing on to your son that this is &quot;hard work&quot; instead of something <br/>\nthat will flower naturally as he heals from his surgery and becomes more <br/>\naccustomed to speaking with his new mouth in (maybe) a new language?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m making an assumption, that you can correct if I&#39;m wrong, that he is also <br/>\nlearning a new language, English - or perhaps hearing English being spoken <br/>\nall around him with different accents than he might have become used to. <br/>\nThat might be part of his slow pace in learning to make fully intelligible <br/>\nsounds after his surgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about singing, karaoke (we have a machine Granny gave us for Christmas) <br/>\nor playing monsters or lions or dragons (roaring sounds to open the throat)?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be like me trying to learn to write neatly using my toes.  Sure, I<br/>\n&gt; could learn, but it would take real effort. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could consider it work. Or you could consider it fun that would improve <br/>\nwith practice. People do learn to write and paint with their toes if they <br/>\nhave lost their arms for some reason. (Also with their mouths) They learn <br/>\nbecause it enables them to communicate with writing or drawing. If they were <br/>\nbeing prevented from making marks until they had done a bunch of toe <br/>\nstrengthening exercises, I bet their progress would be slower than if they <br/>\nwere given the means to make marks and the opportunity to look at the <br/>\nresults. I bet their family members and close associates would be able to <br/>\nread their foot written words sooner than strangers seeing it for the first <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal effort need not be a negative if there is a personally meaningful real <br/>\nreason to make the effort. All the good reasons that I might have for my dd <br/>\nto learn something that is challenging to her are pointless if she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a good reason of her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, if it were me, I would not continue with this therapy that is <br/>\ndistressing my child for the time being, and see how things go. You can <br/>\nalways return to therapy, perhaps with a different therapist, later. If you <br/>\ndo, involve your ds in the choice of therapist.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

but then again i think everyone is!  i have a 10 year old DS and we&#39;ve been through many phases in the last 14 months of &quot;deschooling&quot; - he&#39;s not so social, so the waiting for friends hasn&#39;t been an issue, but he definitely went through a loooong period of just watching tv and playing video games and not being interested in much else, even if i WAS being interesting, interested, inviting, and engaging.  in fact my invitations and engagement were experienced as pressure by him - pressure to be doing something different than what he was doing - yet another way in which he was &quot;wrong&quot; or needed fixing- even though i *tried* to be concious of not sending that message.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  but eventually, he moved on from that and started taking an interest in things and expressing that he was bored and needed more activities, interests, passions.  in  my experience, the two things you mentioned are important - being interesting and also offering and engaging him in things (if he&#39;s receptive), but a third thing was even more important in our case - *following* my son.  there were little, almost imperceptible ways in which i could choose to follow his interest and expand on it, and support it, or in which i could tamp down the interest and make it less likely to grow.  for my son, *too* much excitement or overt expansion on an interest actually backfired into him losing interest.  it was / is a delicate balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n   but key to it has been *my* willingness to be completely available, primarily on his timing, to follow his lead, in his way, with whatever takes his fancy.  so - he has since gone through phases of interest in baking, and jewelry making (which he still does, and i&#39;ve, over time, created avenues for him to expand this into a business - helped him make a web site, created a market for him to sell at, etc. - but first it was JUST a creative outlet and he had no interest in  selling, growing it.)    he also seems to be an &quot;interest jag&quot; type person - so he does one thing intensively for a while.  we rode bikes every day for a few weeks last summer, for instance.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  yesterday, my son, out of the blue, expressed a desire for more &quot;routine&quot; in his life.  for him, this doesn&#39;t mean a schedule, and it certainly doesn&#39;t mean &quot;having&quot; to go somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go, or an irreversable commitment, but what it means, he explained - is something to look forward to.  so we pulled out our dry erase calendar board and together we decided on a few general things that would repeat every week in some form.  thursdays would be &quot;day trip day&quot; - could mean just to our local amusement park for a couple hours - could mean to the coast or somewhere bigger/further.  sunday would be &quot;project&quot; - he apparently wants to create a project to work on  (with his dad available) that spreads out over weeks or longer - his current vision is a marble run/domino effect thing made of wood or metal piping.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  i also put on there the two regularly occuring things every week that do not involve him but take me out of the house - so he can anticipate and not feel blindsided or out of the loop.  and we put a few tv shows on too - when they air.  that&#39;s ALL that&#39;s on there reoccuring.  and each week he wants to put, in a different color, the things that are just for that week - a movie that he wants to see, or a one time activity that is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n  this is just an example of what is happening in our lives NOW vs. where we were a year ago and how the deschooling process is intricate and long.  just when i start to think - &quot;ug, what are we doing?&quot; he comes up with something that makes it clear we are still moving, flowing, and growing and not as stuck as it might appear.<br/>\n<br/>\n  anyhow - i don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been unschooling/deschooling, but i was relieved to hear during a chat the other day that a year is not really that long.  i think one of the main things that i needed to do is LET GO  and TRUT and *then* i could be more genuinely interesting, and interested, and engaging - without a hidden agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n  warmly, Lyla<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336564039,"authorName":"Jennifer Croce","from":"Jennifer Croce &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt;","profile":"jennifercroce37","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting It","postDate":"1238171755","msgId":43405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5OTg5OS40MzM2OC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxNC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxaWkxNytpc2lvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdxaWkxNytpc2lvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43403,"nextInTopic":43407,"prevInTime":43404,"nextInTime":43406,"topicId":43403,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your post Kelly, I am in the same situation so I d also like advice on this.  I am going to unschool my 6 year old in September and was going to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1565197920\">Thanks for your post Kelly, I am in the same situation so I&#39;d also like advice on this.  I am going to unschool my 6 year old in September and was going to use some structure and have been looking for the curriculum materials they use at her school.  I have been learning from this list that even though I feel my approach is better than formal school it is still very controlled and will most likely not work.  I am working on letting go and working with my child, not directing her or making her conform to my needs.  It&#39;s a hard process, but I think the rewards are going to be great.  I have already seen a difference in her using an unschooling approach..  <br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__,_.._,___<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222924223,"authorName":"kmkjoy","from":"&quot;kmkjoy&quot;

I&#39;ve been unsure of what to do or should I do anything, when he tells me he&#39;s only watching the TV because he is waiting for his schooled friends to get home.<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m coming to realize, through this list and Joyce and Sandra&#39;s sites (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is that the issue is me.  I need to be more engaging, more interesting.  I want my ds to be a person in this family, not a child that needs to be kept apart from &quot;grown up&quot; concerns, issues or tasks.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if I should do the things I&#39;m interested in and in so doing be an example.  Or should I try to engage him in different activites.  Maybe best of all it would be a combination?<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the wisdom of your collective experience. (why doesn&#39;t this have spell check, I&#39;m a horrible speller)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43528,"nextTopicId":43548}}
