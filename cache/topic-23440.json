He asked us what we could tell about <br/>\nit just from the first few lines and my hand shot up (because it was prone to <br/>\ndo so), but this one was GOOD, and very memorable for me.   She was pronouncing <br/>\nSean as the word for already having looked:   &quot;Seen.&quot;      I said &quot;She <br/>\nlearned it from a book.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.     So she didn&#39;t have that one from the oral tradition, but had <br/>\njumpstarted from a written source.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this modern commentary on English, but when I look at it I really do <br/>\nappreciate how meaning is conveyed so much by the appearance of the words, in <br/>\nEnglish:<br/>\n<br/>\nOde to the Spell Checker!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEye halve a spelling chequer<br/>\nIt came with my pea sea<br/>\nIt plainly marques four my revue<br/>\nMiss steaks eye kin knot sea.<br/>\n<br/>\nEye strike a key and type a word<br/>\nAnd weight four it two say<br/>\nWeather eye am wrong oar write<br/>\nIt shows me strait a weigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as a mist ache is maid<br/>\nIt nose bee fore two long<br/>\nAnd eye can put the error rite<br/>\nIts rare lea ever wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nEye have run this poem threw it<br/>\nI am shore your pleased two no<br/>\nIts letter perfect awl the weigh<br/>\nMy chequer tolled me sew.<br/>\n<br/>\n(anonymous, I guess--an e-mail thing)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also explains why &quot;bad spelling&quot; (wrong word choice) is so irritating to <br/>\nvisual readers.
