She also<br/>\nbelieve that Laura memorizes books and guesses at what she reads. She<br/>\nsays that she sees other kids enjoying reading signs out loud. For Laura<br/>\nit is obvious that reading is painful.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHas your mother-in-law ever been in a classroom of 7 yr olds reading aloud?  It <br/>\nIS painful and forced.  Only a few kids can do it well, and even fewer can do it <br/>\nunder pressure.  I don&#39;t even remember reading aloud in the classroom until I <br/>\nwas about 9 or 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is painful for any kid that is being forced to read and simply can&#39;t <br/>\nyet.  The kids that can&#39;t, and there are LOTS, in school are put in special <br/>\nreading programs and caused to feel stupid and inferior for it.  If she&#39;s <br/>\nreading some things and enjoying it, she&#39;s way ahead of about half of the kids <br/>\nthat are in school that are of the same age.  That age, 7 and 8, reading is <br/>\nhighly enforced because once kids hit the 8 yr range, at least in the US, they <br/>\nuse primarily reading as a form of education.  It&#39;s efficient to make sure that <br/>\nall the kids can read on their own to make the classroom run better with the <br/>\nleast amount of individual attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince she&#39;s not in school, she can have all the individual attention she needs <br/>\nand requires to learn what she needs to learn.  She&#39;ll have a better <br/>\nunderstanding of reading once she is there and her mind is ready to read.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot something that can be forced.  It can be faked by kids in schools through <br/>\nmemorization and repetition, but the kid still won&#39;t get it before he gets it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reading Disability?","postDate":"1303061738","msgId":60670,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERGNTY5NTE3LUIzM0MtNEZFNC1CRUVCLTM1MEVBMDg4QkZGMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvZjNoOStzcWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZjNoOStzcWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60680,"prevInTime":60669,"nextInTime":60671,"topicId":60665,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Has anyone been in a similar situation?
