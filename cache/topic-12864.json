I <br/>\nexplained that we were unschoolers and she said I could set up an unschooling <br/>\ntable if I would like.  So here I am.  In a group of mostly &quot;school at home&quot; <br/>\ntypes.  I think there is one parent that is a &quot;unit study&quot; person.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI signed up and my idea was to have some copies of a few essays for people to <br/>\nlook at and take, copies of the registration form for the unschooling <br/>\nconference (is that OK Kelly).  Also would bring my fav books on unschooling <br/>\nand some back issues I have of HEM and Life Learning.  Also want to type up a <br/>\nlist of web sites etc.  I think many people are Internet connected.  Anyway <br/>\njust looking to see if anyone had any other brilliant ideas or favorite web <br/>\nsites.  It is informal so people will be able to look at different <br/>\ncurriculums and talk.  And it is in Mid April so don&#39;t have a lot of time.  I <br/>\nthink their original idea was to have this before the conference and book <br/>\nfair here in NC at the end of May.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to preach or convert people but I guess my object is to maybe <br/>\nget a few people to think a little.  Anyway if anyone has any ideas I would <br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12894,"nextTopicId":12907}}
