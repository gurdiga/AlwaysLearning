I am a homeschooling mother of four in the Houston area.  I am<br/>\nplanning to attend the conference you were metioning, and I was very<br/>\nsurprised at your letter&#39;s description of Sandra Dodd. (it was sent to<br/>\nme by another homeschooling friend who is attending the conference)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Sandra Dodd personally, and have never found her to have an &quot;in<br/>\nyour face&quot; &quot;slap you upside the head&quot; approach at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid ya&#39;ll have some kind of run in or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally was offended by you telling people that they should  not<br/>\nattend -- it makes you sound like some sort of censor to what should or<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be done or learned or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a sister in Lubbock.  I dont see how a trip there would in any<br/>\nway facilitate a trip to Houston.  I am a 12 hour drive away from my<br/>\nsister.  Of course, one could fly from Lubbock to Houston, but<br/>\nthankfully, you wont need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to have to say this, but I found your letter  nothing more<br/>\nthan a thinly veiled attempt to loose some vitriolic diatribe against a<br/>\nvery decent person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, its fine if you dont like someone, but why use your own personal<br/>\n<br/>\nprejudice and foist it upon others, just because you dont like a<br/>\nparticular speaker&#39;s method.  Why not let others find out for<br/>\nthemselves.  If Sandra is truly as bad as you say, let her hang herself<br/>\nwith her own rope.  There is no need for you to waste time or energy on<br/>\nsuch an endevor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you have a wonderful homeschooling life.  Please allow others to<br/>\ndo so always.  Let&#39;s not block the path of learning with petty<br/>\npersonality differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely<br/>\nDJ Brewer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7983,"nextTopicId":8017}}
