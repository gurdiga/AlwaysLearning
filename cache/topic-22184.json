Anyone <br/>\nwho  has taken health education at school and gotten A&#39;s, as I have, could <br/>\nrecite  that truth and would of course live by it, just as with brushing teeth up <br/>\nand  down.  NO WAIT... two years later they said only down on the top, and only <br/>\n up on the bottom, or else you would shove food under your gums.  OH HOLD  <br/>\nON!  Three years later they said do it circularly so you can get the food  out <br/>\nfrom under your gums.  So do exactly what they told you in school and  you&#39;ll <br/>\nbe healthy, and being at a museum at 4:00 a.m. is NOT healthy because  it&#39;s <br/>\njust not right.

You wouldn&#39;t want to distract your child as they<br/>\nexplore or admire some strange object!  Something for me to think about as I<br/>\nfeel that teacher in me bubble up when there&#39;s an audience..

Me and my 3 kids went to the Smithsonian-Natural HIstory Museum the other day, and I must say that I was a bit distracted by many of the parents...maybe I was just tuned into that side of it after the first jolt!  The first one that struck me, was a woman with a few 4-5 year olds...we were by the dinosaur femurs, and she snapped her fingers at them and said &quot;He-LLoooow! Look at the bones!  They aren&#39;t dog bones!&quot;...wow, my kids stopped short (we all did), and kind of were shocked into staring, for a moment or two...more than that for my 8yo!  He told his dad about it when we got home.  And then throughout the course of the time we were there, there were so many adults &quot;pushing&quot; education onto the kids.  Like one man, telling the 2  boys that he was with, upon coming up to an exhibit...&quot;tell me what kind of lesson you see here&quot;.  And a group of people...2-3 adults, and 6-7 kids...&quot;now how do<br/>\n these insects see...right...with their antenaes!&quot;  Which I heard from this group 2 more times, the same sentences...drilling in what the adults think the kids ought to get out of it.  I&#39;m happy that we went along, stopping where we wanted to, not where we didn&#39;t...all of us making that choice.  Too bad we didn&#39;t have longer!  We talked about getting locked in at night, and how cool that would be!<br/>\n <br/>\nKaty<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
