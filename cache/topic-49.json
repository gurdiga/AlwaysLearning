I prefer to frame it as meeting everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds. I don&#39;t want my kid to think &quot;Mom said no so I have to stop<br/>\nasking&quot;, I want her to understand why mom said no... or, actually, mom<br/>\nrarely says no outright, I tend more to say, &quot;I&#39;m rather not do X because<br/>\nY&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m worried that it we X, Y will happen.&quot; and then she&#39;ll either<br/>\nagree, or have a plan to avoid Y, or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think it helps to talk about stuff before it gets out of hand,<br/>\nlike, &quot;I&#39;m feeling a bit stressed with all the noise and crowds here<br/>\nalready and I&#39;d like to get this shopping trip down fast, so could you<br/>\njust go get X and Y and meet me at the checkout, and we&#39;ll zoom?&quot; And I<br/>\ntry to excourage and listen to her, too, when i want to stop at the<br/>\ngrocery store because we&#39;re out of milk and she says, &quot;Could we not<br/>\ntoday, I really just want to go home.&quot; then we don&#39;t stop, because she<br/>\nonly says it when she really isn&#39;t up to a trip...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are off days, of course, cranky grumpy times, and often the<br/>\nbest thing to do then seems to be to call a halt to whatever we&#39;re doing<br/>\nand go out for coffee and chess... just take a break.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) <br/>\n&gt; My two year old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk.

That plus breastmilk makes a pretty<br/>\nhealthy diet, IMO. I really think the food thing ebbs and flows, children<br/>\nspend months or a year or two eating this seemingly narrow range, then<br/>\nsuddenly start trying all sorts of things, if they aren&#39;t coerced into<br/>\nit. I know many, many small children who ate only a few things, and<br/>\nthey&#39;re all fine...<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes trying to limit nursing makes kids want to nurse more, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure if you&#39;re limiting it all the time or just those days of the<br/>\nmonth... It is hard to feel good about nursing when it&#39;s physically<br/>\nuncomfortable, though. My daughter used to generally nurse more when we<br/>\nstayed around the house, if your son is the same way then maybe planning<br/>\nmore out of the house activities on those days would help...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
