Originally, everyone knew about <br/>\nJehovah God.  Following the tower of Babel , some entire <br/>\npeople groups deliberately rejected God and refused to pass on God&#39;s <br/>\ntruth to their children.  Sometimes bits and pieces of the truth got <br/>\npassed through the generations, and sometimes when missionaries went <br/>\nto tell them the truth, the pieces fell together and people again <br/>\nturned to God.  Sometimes they still refused to follow God.  So there <br/>\nis no people group who never knew of God.  Those who don&#39;t have any <br/>\nBible or knowledge of Jesus Christ are that way because at some point <br/>\nin history, their ancestors rejected God.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible says (Romans 1) that God reveals Himself to people through <br/>\nnature.  So when people are convicted with the truth of a Creator and <br/>\ndesire to know more of Him, He finds a way to reveal Himself to them. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I stopped being friends (we weren&#39;t very close anyway) with a woman <br/>\n </span></blockquote>who I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; believe is psychologically abusing her children.
