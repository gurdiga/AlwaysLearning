Write there, and participate in as many Christian discussions  <br/>\nas you can find and when a topic comes up that you&#39;ve already blogged  <br/>\nabout, you could send them a link to that one blog post.   That would  <br/>\nget them to your blog to read other things, and it would keep you  <br/>\nfrom feeling you were disrupting a more conventional, conservative  <br/>\nflow by bringing the whole counter-argument there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to become a voice in the unschooling community is to BE a  <br/>\nvoice.    I&#39;ve seen some people try to self-promote when other  <br/>\nunschoolers are saying &quot;Who?&quot; (or &quot;oh, no...&quot;).   It&#39;s better to  <br/>\nbecome a known, regular voice than to be quiet for years and then  <br/>\napply to conferences for the opportunity to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting ideas out in public is like putting rocks in a rock  <br/>\npolisher.  They roll around and the rough edges are smoothed off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s never been around a rock polisher, I  <br/>\nshould add that it&#39;s noisy and takes a long time.  Weeks.    A month  <br/>\nsometimes, if you want something very smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas that haven&#39;t been out in public and turned over and run through  <br/>\nlots of other people&#39;s ideas aren&#39;t good ideas for presenting in  <br/>\ntalks.
