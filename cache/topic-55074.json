How that looks by the time they reach adulthood, parents can *do* something about!  There is a very common misperception among many parents, that if they push and poke and prod, even kindly, that they will have at least tried to create brilliance, when it so clearly doesn&#39;t work.  What DOES work is creating an environment that happily supports kids, that empowers them to feel as if they CAN, and then actively helpkids open doors to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see so many parents force and force and when it doesn&#39;t work, they apply more force.

I&#39;ve found that people who move easily from fear to excitement don&#39;t always realize that others don&#39;t have the same process. Its not something pathological, necessarily, its a difference in wiring, a different set of reactions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes freeze up from fear. This is very inconvenient when I&#39;m at, for instance, the top of three tiers of scaffolding and need to get down. Sometimes that first moment of swinging out over the edge is too much, and I sit down on the scaffold and breath for awhile until the fear ebbs to a manageable level. Its harder for me when people are watching, although I know others for whom the opposite is true - my coworker, Alex for instance. He can push past fear if there&#39;s someone to show off for. I don&#39;t so much push past fear when I&#39;m alone as experience so much less of it that its just data - a reminder that what I&#39;m doing is dangerous. Its not exciting to me, though, its still fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy coworker and I talked about fear one day and he was shocked when I told him how I experience fear, about the wall of white that descends across my vision and I&#39;m nearly paralyzed. He&#39;s never felt that. I&#39;ve never felt fear turn to excitement, although I&#39;ve felt it turn to fury when someone has really pushed me. I don&#39;t like that, because when I&#39;m that angry, I&#39;ll disregard my own safety and that of others. That&#39;s not healthy! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done a few different kinds of public speaking, and had similar experiences there. I don&#39;t mean I do better when I&#39;m alone (sort of defeats the point) but that I&#39;m less fearful when I&#39;m not so aware of myself. When I can focus on other people - the class or audience - bring them into what I&#39;m doing, then the fear is background noise. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning something in front of another person is excruciating for me. Its hard for me to be anything other than frozen. I&#39;ve developed strategies for that, found ways to shift my focus away from myself when I want to learn something *from* another person but those strategies depend on other people playing along. There were things I couldn&#39;t learn as a child because adults would coax and push and I&#39;d fall apart, but as an adult I can learn them because I&#39;m very good at telling other adults where my boundaries are. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very protective of my kids&#39; boundaries, especially Mo&#39;s since adults (and sometimes kids) try to cross her boundaries, coax her or push her or try to engage her when she doesn&#39;t want to be engaged. She doesn&#39;t need that kind of &quot;help&quot;. She already has strategies for moving past her fears, expanding her comfort zone. I&#39;ve seen her do it with groups of people, with &quot;scary&quot; movies, walking in the dark, spiders, and learning new things. She&#39;s a different person with different experiences than mine, and I can&#39;t speak to her experience of fear, but it doesn&#39;t stop her. Fear may be a limit but in her unschooling life limits are, many times, puzzles to solve. She knows she doesn&#39;t have to figure out how to deal with fear all at once any more than she needed to figure out how to read in one day, or learn to ride a bike in one day.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Supporting learning WAS Re: Boy Scouts,  following intstructions, taking direction","postDate":"1276983017","msgId":55097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERGOEYyQTBBLTdFODUtNEY1RS05QTMyLUJFMzBEREU1MkFCOUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrUGlERWREZTg0d0RlZ25JMlZEQ2lMMmJGaHVpUUQ3U0FBVDN6VEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrWUluMXBxNHVTNGN2enRDQTZiQU9qdXFoXzVNZUFyd203NjdmVUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDAwMEFEMEZGLUZGNjUtNDBDMC1CNUM5LTBCQzcyOUNFMjZFMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDRDMUNCN0UwLjYwMTA2MDFAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWtQaURFZERlODR3RGVnbkkyVkRDaUwyYkZodWlRRDdTQUFUM3pUQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55095,"nextInTopic":55098,"prevInTime":55096,"nextInTime":55098,"topicId":55074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And she&#39;s  <br/>\npretty good at it - once she gets on the horse. She&#39;s at the point of  <br/>\ntears now when she&#39;s expected to tack up her horse. So, she&#39;s not  <br/>\nriding right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSenna had a perfect riding instructor a couple of years ago, who was  <br/>\nused to working with children and adults who had fears or some kind of  <br/>\ndifficulty (some not even related to horses). She tacked up Senna&#39;s  <br/>\nhorse, asked her to help now and again and always accepted a &quot;no&quot;.   <br/>\nLittle by little, Senna was able to get closer and do more. Then Mary,  <br/>\nher instructor moved to Alaska. Bad news for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSenna thinks her fear stems from a bad experience with tacking up a  <br/>\nparticular horse before we found Mary, but if I think back, she&#39;s  <br/>\nalways been sensitive to animals and perhaps was always a bit freaked  <br/>\nout by the on-the-ground part. I wonder if the instructors at her  <br/>\nfirst and second camps pushed her through her fear? I was close and  <br/>\nstayed at the barn, but I wasn&#39;t allowed to be behind the scenes. I  <br/>\nwould notice a glimmer of discomfort now and again in future lessons,  <br/>\nbut she seemed to overcome it. Little did I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the upshot of it all is that at 15, one of her most-loved hobbies  <br/>\n(and indeed at one time she had set herself the goal of becoming a  <br/>\njumper as a career) has ceased to be appealing to her, because every  <br/>\nriding school *requires* a rider to tack up their horse. In our most  <br/>\nrecent experience, the stable owner had a trainer help her, but Senna  <br/>\nwas still required to do some of the work with a brand new horse. She  <br/>\nfinally decided she couldn&#39;t face that fear every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re hoping and looking to find a riding instructor even a little  <br/>\nlike Mary (I think she&#39;s one a kind).

My oldest son tends to be a perfectionist, and this looks to me to be like something he came with, because goodness knows we&#39;ve never suggested that the only way to be a success at anything is to do it perfectly (my children learn the opposite, in fact, every day if they pay any attention at all to my attempts at housekeeping). So, sometimes, even though he&#39;s never gotten that message from us, he will describe himself as stupid for not understanding something right away, for instance, rather than putting that one time of being slower to catch on in the context of all the many times he&#39;s understood something quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is only one part of his make-up; on the other hand, he is often untroubled by others&#39; opinions of him (he does not seem to care at all that he is 9 and still using training wheels on his bike when other kids have long since given them up, or that he is regularly mistaken for a girl because of his very long hair). It&#39;s not something that comes up all the time.

Though I&#39;d say I live with a kind of Venn diagram: stuff I know I&#39;m not interested in or can&#39;t do; stuff I know I am interested in and can do; stuff I&#39;m interested in but not sure whether I can do it or not, or hesitant to try, or not sure I am up to making the sacrifices I&#39;d have to make to accomplish it, or otherwise &quot;unsure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I have figured this stuff out is through trial and error. &quot;Wow, that was way too much for me, won&#39;t be doing that again,&quot; the feeling of regret when I don&#39;t try something I was interested in because I felt fearful or unsure, the satisfaction of trying something new and succeeding at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do look to trusted others for guidance when I&#39;m not sure: friends, my partner, sometimes a therapist. One of my parenting goals is to be a trusted other for my kids. So sometimes I will say to Eric, &quot;I think you&#39;d enjoy that if you tried it,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll support you any way I can if you decide to try it.&quot; I also say, &quot;It&#39;s OK not to do it right now,&quot; and things like, &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a chance to try it another time,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll bring you back if you want to come try it sometime.&quot; I think one of my jobs is to hold all those possibilities open for him. And to support him when another adult is pushing an agenda or pressuring him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Which is how I discover<br/>\n&gt; new capabilities.

How could you possibly know this? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m honestly curious. I was just thinking the other day about how hellish my childhood was and how much I longed to escape it, both the house I grew up in and the schools I was attending. But to everyone around I looked like I was doing great. I was always clean and well-groomed, I had boyfriends in high school, I was in Honor Society, I was a National Merit Scholar, I played piano for the swing choir and lettered in downhill and slalom racing, I was polite and well-behaved and didn&#39;t do drugs or have sex or drink. But I was miserable  and I was being damaged by toxic parenting and I didn&#39;t know how to say No to things I was uncomfortable with until much later in life. Not only could no one have seen this from the outside, but every adult I attempted to reach out to, including my parents and teachers, to whom I said in so many words, &quot;I think I need help, maybe I need a psychiatrist, I&#39;m miserable&quot; pooh-poohed me, in part because my success was so plain to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I carry this skepticism that you (the generic you, not the specific you) can tell how a kid is really doing from how they appear to you in whatever role of scout leader, teacher, wilderness guide you&#39;ve encountered them. A kid like I was gets really good at not letting adults know how she&#39;s really feeling, so it&#39;s easy for me to imagine a group leader walking away from a day&#39;s adventure with a great sense of satisfaction at having helped that timid kid discover her inner strength, while that timid kid is going home to cry from having once again had her feelings and wishes ridden right over by a grown-up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids are not listened to. Grown-ups tell them then they&#39;re hungry, when they&#39;re not hungry, when they&#39;re sleepy, when they&#39;re not sleepy, when they &quot;really&quot; want to go outside to play, even who they want to be friends with. Just doing our best to listen to and believe what kids tell us about themselves--our kids, kids we encounter who aren&#39;t ours--is a big step away from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, almost 3!<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Supporting learning WAS Re: Boy Scouts, \tfollowing intstructions, taking direction","postDate":"1276980733","msgId":55095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrUGlERWREZTg0d0RlZ25JMlZEQ2lMMmJGaHVpUUQ3U0FBVDN6VEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMUNCN0UwLjYwMTA2MDFAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrWUluMXBxNHVTNGN2enRDQTZiQU9qdXFoXzVNZUFyd203NjdmVUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDAwMEFEMEZGLUZGNjUtNDBDMC1CNUM5LTBCQzcyOUNFMjZFMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPDRDMUNCN0UwLjYwMTA2MDFAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55094,"nextInTopic":55097,"prevInTime":55094,"nextInTime":55096,"topicId":55074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Seems to me it s easy to think that children are obligated to master fear.

It honestly has been a point of deschooling for me in our<br/>\nfamily. Karl was afraid of the dark and mostly overcame that. I was<br/>\nmostly sympathethic but had a hard time relating since I was not a kid<br/>\nwho was afraid of the dark. I have a sister a year younger and one of<br/>\nmy fondest memories is getting up at night from our room to take her<br/>\nto the bathroom since she was scared and wanted company. That helped<br/>\nme to respect it when I had a kid who feared the dark rather than<br/>\ndisregard it and make him push thru his fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat experience gave me confidence to respect other fears encountered later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the kind of kid who was brave and in many ways encouraged to be<br/>\nso even to the point of foolhardiness. My dad wanted us to forge ahead<br/>\nabout certain things. I didn&#39;t cotton to horseriding and still feel<br/>\nlike a wimp over that even tho I realize now that I&#39;m not the<br/>\n&quot;take-charge&quot; sort who usually finds riding horses easy. I have been<br/>\nmade out as a sort of wimpy parent by people who think I&#39;m not taking<br/>\ncharge of Karl. It&#39;s the same sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I find it to be a strength to relationship building, not just with<br/>\nKarl but also my mate. Brian doesn&#39;t have to do the things he does<br/>\n(work almost everyday, maintain cars, be at peace with us, take us out<br/>\nto eat, buy groceries we pick out, to name but a few things) anymore<br/>\nthan I have to do things for him. Being in a relationship doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto be about mutual slavery. I consider the things I do for others to<br/>\nbe almost all a matter of choice. And yes the relationship relies on<br/>\nthose acts. Some action is where there are needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the same token, my child doesn&#39;t have to respond to someone&#39;s<br/>\nexpectation that he ignore his fears and live up to external desires<br/>\nfor him to achieve. He can if he chooses to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight it be that you just haven&#39;t noticed when others around you have<br/>\nhad their achievements superceded by enthusiasms and expectations that<br/>\ngave them the idea they were obligated to achieve? I know for me it<br/>\nwas a silent hope that no one noticed I was afraid to screw things up.<br/>\nIn hopes that I looked confident about something I didn&#39;t really want<br/>\nto do. Horses are definitely one of the more scary of those and no<br/>\nmatter how much I want to overcome the phobia... I really don&#39;t care<br/>\nto get over the fear. If I absolutely had to... maybe I could.

Children whose parents push food on them, tell them when they are hungry and what they are hungry for are much less able to monitor when they are full than are children who are allowed to eat when and what they want to eat. It seems to me that not trusting a child to know their own limitations can have huge repercussion. I can&#39;t imagine how unschooling can appeal to someone who believes that children can be pushed without negative effects. Really. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sense of what I can handle is pretty accurate. As my confidence grows about something I broach it more readily. Someone pushing me beyond my comfort level is someone who I resist with great vigor. I have watched both Simon and Linnaea learn new things without being pushed by others, I have seen them deal with the things that once scared them as they&#39;ve grown.

I think part of the problem  <br/>\nis that when kids are pushed and they succeed at something they didn&#39;t  <br/>\nthink they wanted or could do, they can be even more jazzed than the  <br/>\nkids who jumped right in. That seems like a good thing. For the kids  <br/>\nwho end up jazzed, for the most part, it probably is. But the policy  <br/>\nof pushing kids out of their comfort zone comes at a price that&#39;s  <br/>\noften invisible to the ones who are pushing. (And when it fails, it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the pushing that failed but because the child is flawed, eg,  <br/>\ntoo timid, too lacking in self confidence, too stubborn.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect instructors see their goal as accomplishing the activity  <br/>\nrather than supporting the child. If a child didn&#39;t want to do any of  <br/>\nthe activities in a program, wouldn&#39;t it feel like a failure at the  <br/>\nend? And it&#39;s likely if the parents have put their child in a program  <br/>\nthat&#39;s so counter to their child&#39;s nature it&#39;s *because* the parents  <br/>\nwant the child pushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from an unschooling perspective, its more important that the child  <br/>\ntrust the parent will listen and be their advocate than that the child  <br/>\nsucceed at this one task that&#39;s right now before him. The conventional  <br/>\nwisdom is that kids will remain timid if they don&#39;t experience success  <br/>\nbeyond their comfort zone. But what&#39;s that theory based on? Where&#39;s  <br/>\nthe control group of kids whose pace at exploring their boundaries is  <br/>\nsupported? (Well, it&#39;s unschoolers but we&#39;re so outside the norm that  <br/>\nwe don&#39;t get included in the data people use to base their conclusions  <br/>\non. ;-) Where&#39;s the follow up on the psychological effect on kids who  <br/>\nwere pushed but didn&#39;t succeed? Or succeeded but end up feeling  <br/>\nuncomfortable that they allowed themselves to be pushed? Or get the  <br/>\nidea that their own sense of self can&#39;t be trusted and they need to  <br/>\nrely on others to push them?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately it&#39;s the rousing successes from pushing that stick in  <br/>\npeople&#39;s minds. It&#39;s the musicians with great talent that thank their  <br/>\nparents for pushing them to practice and continue that stick. We don&#39;t  <br/>\nsee the far more common stories of people who hated being pushed, who  <br/>\nacquired a distaste for what they were pushed into (and in some cases  <br/>\na distaste for the parents who cared more about their agenda for the  <br/>\nchild than about the child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more I&#39;m seeing programs where the instructors insist that  <br/>\nchildren be there because they want to be. It&#39;s probably because it&#39;s  <br/>\nbest for the instructors and the other kids in the class. But it&#39;s a  <br/>\nside benefit for reluctant kids whose parents might have pushed them  <br/>\nto do something the kids didn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat parents can do instead of pushing is respecting the child&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings. And in some cases dropping it until the child is older and  <br/>\nthen offering again. And in some cases keep the door open to the  <br/>\nopportunity so it&#39;s available for when the child decides they&#39;re  <br/>\nready. And in some cases ask them to give it a try and they can drop  <br/>\nit if they don&#39;t like it. (Sometimes their image of what something is  <br/>\nlike is far off of what it is just from lack of experience. Come up  <br/>\nwith a couple of ways to get over a hump (like staying with them). But  <br/>\n*do* respect their discomfort. What they can get from the activity is  <br/>\nno where near as important as them trusting you&#39;re their advocate  <br/>\nagainst pressure to move outside their comfort zone.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s better depends on the circumstance. It depends on the child.  <br/>\nAnd in many many cases: Ask! Ask after the fact how the child would  <br/>\nlike the parent to handle situations like that. And then do it. Be  <br/>\ntrustworthy. Check in every once in a while to see if what the child  <br/>\nasked for is working and if they&#39;d like to try another tactic. (If a  <br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t know, be okay with that. Some don&#39;t. But you&#39;ve planted  <br/>\na seed and you can ask again next time after they&#39;ve had time to turn  <br/>\nover possibilities.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Supporting learning WAS Re: Boy Scouts, following  instructions, taking direction","postDate":"1276942711","msgId":55076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3MzQ3NS4zNDEucW1Ad2ViODYyMDgubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrWUluMXBxNHVTNGN2enRDQTZiQU9qdXFoXzVNZUFyd203NjdmVUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrWUluMXBxNHVTNGN2enRDQTZiQU9qdXFoXzVNZUFyd203NjdmVUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55075,"nextInTopic":55077,"prevInTime":55075,"nextInTime":55077,"topicId":55074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have worked hard to respect both Simon s and Linnaea s boundaries.

Both of them have stated very clearly when they didn&#39;t want to do something. We did a rope course last October and Linnaea quit at the first set of ladders and ropes. David absolutely respected her decision not to. She said later that as soon as she walked away from it she wished that she had a pushed herself a little further. Simon and I went on and did the first two sets of the the 5 total sets and he was done. But Linnaea thought that course through of the winter and decided come this spring that she wanted to go again. In her own time and with absolute knowledge that we respected her willingness to do or not do the course, she did all of the course. She took the harder paths around, the ones that had optional easier ways to go. Simon and David went together this time along with a friend of Simon&#39;s and they stopped one set before the end. But they had fun on their own terms with<br/>\n the experience. Nobody second guessed their commitment to the activity, nobody questioned their reasons for stopping. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Linnaea and I finished the course she talked about wishing she&#39;d done it the first time and I suggested that having the winter to reapproach it made it a much more full on and exciting experience. That if she&#39;d put aside her reluctance the first time, if she&#39;d not listened to her gut feeling she might not have enjoyed it as much anyhow. And, again, it helped her to know that choices are hers to make. That David and I will absolutely respect her decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have experienced people working to coerce Simon or Linnaea into trying something they weren&#39;t comfortable with trying. I have, on a very rare occasion, been that person. Simon will slump down and go very quiet and will still refuse to do the thing. Linnaea will become very vocal about not wanting to do it. Trusting them, respecting their decisions about what they want to do has given them the freedom to try or not try something of their own choosing. Being willing to take the hit for being an overprotective parent in those moments when whoever is pushing is really invested in getting them to do what they want them to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam wrote: Think of the lesson learned. &quot;My sense of what I can handle isn&#39;t <br/>\naccurate.&quot; &quot;If I&#39;m uncomfortable about doing something, I should do it <br/>\nanyway.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t trust myself.&quot;  Apply those thoughts to other things <br/>\nthat might come up in a girl&#39;s life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s also applicable to a boy&#39;s life.

Sure, if it can be avoided,<br/>\nit will be avoided, but if it happens, I don&#39;t see how it is wrong. I<br/>\nam interested in getting an insight into how it can be avoided. How<br/>\ncould the instructors &#39;get&#39; that this child meant what she said when<br/>\nshe was scared and she was likely to escalate on the face and to leave<br/>\nher alone. If there are observations or cues that could alert a &#39;back<br/>\noff&#39; that currently doesn&#39;t exist or what a correct response could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering how much you think the embarrassment was a part of her<br/>\ntrauma. It is also something we noticed in this camp. Fear of failure<br/>\n- not so much as performance, but self-image. Perhaps school children<br/>\nare less sensitive about their dignity in needing help or coming to<br/>\nattention as someone who needs help or is unable to carry through<br/>\nsomething they started, because they are used to adults &#39;knowing<br/>\nbetter&#39;? Because it occurs to me that often the kind of instructions<br/>\nto beginner climbers may seem to be too much like teaching/telling..<br/>\nsafety protocols, assistance in the form of very specific actions<br/>\n&quot;STAND on your right leg&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t tense your body&quot; etc. It could make<br/>\nan unschooling child go &quot;don&#39;t tell me what to do&quot; and become<br/>\nembarrassing as a part of a group?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am asking this not just as an outdoor instructor, but also as an<br/>\nunschooling parent. It seems something vital to be in touch with and a<br/>\ngap in my awareness and consideration of situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/19/10, Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On 6/18/2010 10:24 PM, Vidyut Kale wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I was just pointing out that some of our choices<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can decrease engagement and make involvement more difficult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Our?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some parents, especially of younger children, give the kids the idea<br/>\n&gt; that there IS something to be afraid of and that they should not try the<br/>\n&gt; activity. I&#39;ve seen that, once in a while, too. I have been putting on<br/>\n&gt; an activity that is messy - and the kid was just fine until the parent<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;Oh, Johnny hates to be messy, let me clean you up a little,<br/>\n&gt; Johnny.&quot; Then the kid becomes aware of being messy and loses that &quot;flow&quot;<br/>\n&gt; of the activity. I understand this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But - Vidyut - you attributed it to the children not having had enough<br/>\n&gt; exposure to other adults &quot;helping them learn.&quot; This is so not true of<br/>\n&gt; unschooled kids, in general.  It is my experience, and I have a lot of<br/>\n&gt; it, that it is FAR more common that the adults-in-charge are full of<br/>\n&gt; themselves and sure they know better than the children (and their<br/>\n&gt; parents) that the child should be pressured into doing the activity. I<br/>\n&gt; know you wouldn&#39;t use the word &quot;pressured&quot; but that is what it is -<br/>\n&gt; probably more for some kids than others, but how would you know which<br/>\n&gt; kids would feel it that way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter, Roya, is a brave and super high energy person and she was<br/>\n&gt; like that as a child, too. She is THE most enthusiastic person I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; every known when it comes to trying out new experiences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She got the chance to go rock climbing (with all the ropes, etc.) and<br/>\n&gt; she thought it sounded wonderful. She wanted to do it. When she got<br/>\n&gt; there, faced with the reality of it, she was too scared and didn&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; to do it. The instructors were super nice and encouraging and<br/>\n&gt; supportive. They had lots and lots of experience. They had her try some<br/>\n&gt; things on the ground, and then just a foot off the ground. They sweetly<br/>\n&gt; cajoled her into giving it a try and she got part way up and she<br/>\n&gt; completely and totally fell apart. She was crying and embarrassed and<br/>\n&gt; too scared to do anything. Frozen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When they got her down, they said things about how she should be proud<br/>\n&gt; that she was brave enough to try. She didn&#39;t feel that way at ALL. She<br/>\n&gt; felt stupid that she&#39;d done it even though she knew it wasn&#39;t a good<br/>\n&gt; idea for her. She&#39;d have been a whole lot happier if they would have<br/>\n&gt; trusted her to decide for herself. She felt doubly bad about herself for<br/>\n&gt; letting someone else talk her into it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So why did Roya do it? She thinks of herself as brave and she wanted to<br/>\n&gt; act bravely. She didn&#39;t want to let down the people who wanted her to do<br/>\n&gt; it. She got embarrassed by the attention. She believed them when they<br/>\n&gt; said they were sure she could do it. I don&#39;t know. And the leaders<br/>\n&gt; convinced her she could do it. They were wrong to do that - they<br/>\n&gt; presumed too much. They didn&#39;t know how brave she normally is. They took<br/>\n&gt; her for a kid who needed some support. They were wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really do know that running organized activities for groups of<br/>\n&gt; unschooled kids is different than for schooled or homeschooled kids. I<br/>\n&gt; had a girl scout troop of mostly unschooled girls of all ages, for a few<br/>\n&gt; years.  Instead of doing group activities, we set up stations that the<br/>\n&gt; girls could go to and spend as much or as little time with as they<br/>\n&gt; wanted. And we always met at a place where they could play freely, too.<br/>\n&gt; As they got older, they came up with the activities they wanted to do,<br/>\n&gt; themselves, instead of showing up to pre-planned activities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54969,"nextTopicId":55169}}
