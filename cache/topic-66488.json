He had SO much fun and I was more relaxed than ever.  In fact, the<br/>\ntime just flew by as I spent time enjoying the fresh air instead of<br/>\nordering him around, insisting we see ALL the animals.<br/>\n<br/>\n   There were lots of schools there and I could not help but notice the<br/>\nstark difference.  I heard a teacher telling a child he was in time out;<br/>\n15 students waiting in line to ride a train, then waiting on the train<br/>\nfor the train to go, then waiting again to go to the bathroom.  I was<br/>\nexhausted just watching how their every move was so directed.  I was a<br/>\nreal rebel today, allowing my 3 year old to tell ME when he was ready<br/>\nfor his diaper change, which he did.  Okay, maybe a little later than I<br/>\nwould have prefered considering the diaper was almost falling out of his<br/>\npants, but hey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed how much my son was learning today - how much MORE he<br/>\nlearned because of his natural curiousity and questions.  He played full<br/>\nof energy for two hours!!  I am NOT kidding!  This is his NATURAL energy<br/>\nlevel.  Therefore, it hit home that making him feel bad because he goes<br/>\nup a porch side ways, or because he runs and doesn&#39;t walk from point a<br/>\nto point b is utterly cruel to a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way out a daughter asked her Mom is she could play in the sand<br/>\npile.  The Mother replied, &quot;No, I am not sending you back to school<br/>\ndirty.&quot; [:-s]<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this list which gives me a place to express my thoughts as I<br/>\ngrow as a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66467,"nextTopicId":66470}}
