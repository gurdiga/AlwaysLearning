I was coming <br/>\nfrom a place of control and fear, to a place of love and trust.  I <br/>\nhad four children and wanted to give them a life that was joyful and <br/>\nsecure and help them to stay who they were.  I wanted to see them as <br/>\nthe perfect beings that they were and honor that.  Not, try to shape <br/>\nthem into something I felt they needed to be.  I was on a train that <br/>\nwas gaining momemtum.  I sometimes felt like I knew what a born again <br/>\nchristian felt like because I was so &quot;high&quot; in the way, this way of <br/>\nliving and thinking, made me feel.  I was learning so much and <br/>\nchallenging myself daily to be better and more patient and in the <br/>\nnow.   I could feel a hum of rightness in me that kept me on this <br/>\npath.  When i slipped into old habits it felt wrong.  When I made <br/>\npositive, concious choices it was so right.  My children were such <br/>\nwonderful teachers.  They kept me on the path.  They challenged me.  <br/>\nSam was my biggest challenger.  A wonderful, sweet, funny, kind, <br/>\nenergetic  boy to all who knew him.  A boy who pushed every button I <br/>\nhad and kept pushing sometimes beyond my breaking point.  Before <br/>\nunschooling, I made terrible choices in relating to him, after <br/>\nunschooling, we started to find a way to understand each other.  He <br/>\nnever gave me a break though.  He always stood his ground.  As I <br/>\nlearned more and tried to be more present and understanding and <br/>\nrespectful, I began to understand what a gift he was to me.  We began <br/>\nto understand each other more.  He started to let me in and trust <br/>\nme.  His energy was so intense, I had trouble sometimes with patience <br/>\nwith him, but I knew that without him, I would not be able to work so <br/>\nwell on challenging myself to be more patient.  Just as I was really <br/>\nbeginning to understand that, Sam died.  I remember thinking, &quot;I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t finished yet!  I need a lot more lessons from you!&quot;  I wish I <br/>\ncould say that through his death I found the strength to stay with <br/>\nthe momentum I was feeling and living.  I did not.  I withdrew.  I <br/>\nwent through I time of such intense emotion and then nothing.  I <br/>\nclosed it all up.  I didn&#39;t feel.  Most of my joy and anger and <br/>\nsaddness and hope were stuffed into a place and whenever a little of <br/>\nit started to come out, I would stuff it back in fear of it all <br/>\ncoming out and causing me to lose my mind in all of it&#39;s intenseness. <br/>\nPeople think I&#39;m &quot;amazing&quot; in the way I&#39;ve handled this.  I don&#39;t.  I <br/>\nstruggle not to numb myself with wine every night.  I wonder what all <br/>\nthose intense feelings are doing to my insides.  I mourn for my <br/>\nchildren the loss of the mother that could have been.  Even though I <br/>\nfeel I have done well with them.  I have remained a positive, loving, <br/>\npresent mother with them, but they lost a big part of me that day.  I <br/>\ncan only be so present and so loving.  I have all the patience in the <br/>\nworld, but it&#39;s not through mindful practice, it&#39;s because impatience <br/>\ntakes some emotion and Iike I said I am lacking in a lot of that.   <br/>\nAbout 2 years ago, I decided that we needed to do more with school.  <br/>\nJack was 9 and still not reading.  Jamie was 6 and though I knew she <br/>\ncould absolutely learn to read on her own (she showed a lot of <br/>\ninterest in reading unlike Jack) I decided we should start some <br/>\nlessons.  And while we were at it and little daily math.  I decided <br/>\nthat unschooling wasn&#39;t as great as I thought it was.  What was <br/>\nreally happening is that I didn&#39;t have the energy or drive to do what <br/>\nit takes to really unschool and I wanted some control in my life and <br/>\nI was letting fear take over and I got back on that path.  I think I <br/>\njustified it with the thinking that Jack was suffering because of his <br/>\nlack of reading.  He wasn&#39;t getting to experience as much as he <br/>\nshould because he couldn&#39;t read yet.  I wouldn&#39;t sign him up for <br/>\nthings because of it.  Jack however NEVER expressed a problem with <br/>\nhis reading.  He never felt bad about it or embarrassed as far as I <br/>\ncould see.  I just justified that somewhere inside, he HAD to have a <br/>\nproblem with it.  A couple of weeks ago I decided that having them <br/>\ncopy pages out of books would be an easy way for them to write and <br/>\nspell and read.  How easy would that be!?  So, we started that.  The <br/>\nfirst day was fine.  After that, a lot of resistance.  The reading <br/>\nand daily math had only ever met a little resistance(I kept it light <br/>\nand it was never really daily), but the writing was the breaking <br/>\npoint for them.   Then the real clincher.  I have been working part <br/>\ntime and Jack asked if I was going to be working tomorrow.  When i <br/>\nsaid no, he gave a disappointed &quot;awww&quot;.  I asked why he was <br/>\ndisapponted and he shrugged.  I said, is it cause you wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nto do school stuff.   And he said &quot;yeah&quot; with a smile.<br/>\nShit!  What have I become!?  Who have WE become.  I want my kids to <br/>\nlove to be around me.  My oldest went to high school for 9th grade.  <br/>\nI think it was partly because when Sam died, she was left with 2 <br/>\nyounger siblings and a big gap between them.  She is 6 years older <br/>\nthan Jack.  She was unschooled for 8 years and it took her til her <br/>\nsenior year of high school (this year) before she wanted to spend any <br/>\nof her free time away from her family.  She is such an awesome person <br/>\nbecause she is who she is suppose to be, not some version of what I <br/>\nthought she should be.   Why am I not doing that for my youngest 2!?  <br/>\nAs much as I know how awesome they are, I am letting fear make <br/>\ndecisions for me.  I need to stop.  I need to find my way back to the <br/>\npath that was truely right for me and us.  I feel like I have been <br/>\nliving a lie for the last 2 years.  I need to find my truth again.  I <br/>\ntold Jack and Jamie that we wouldn&#39;t be doing &quot;school stuff&quot; any <br/>\nmore.  Now I know I can&#39;t turn back.  They will help me.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what I will need for this new journey.  I know <br/>\nintellectually about unschooling.  I guess i just need to learn to <br/>\nfeel it again.  I think being active on this list may help.  It <br/>\nhelped me in the beginning, to express my ideas and opinions (old aol <br/>\nboards).  <br/>\nSo I&#39;m fighting my way back.  I hope you&#39;ll be patient with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna Wilkinson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33273,"nextTopicId":33889}}
