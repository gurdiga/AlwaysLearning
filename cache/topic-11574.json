It&#39;s not. <br/>\nThe most common scenario is that dad  asks the court to order his children <br/>\nschooled, hoping to avoid paying support. Even dads who previously supported <br/>\nand encouraged homeschooling have been know to do this. At least one divorce <br/>\ncourt judge has also stepped in and ordered children into school when neither <br/>\nparent requested that outcome. There are probably other families we don&#39;t <br/>\nknow about who didn&#39;t raise a fuss and went along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the family being discussed, one of the problems is the dad is trying to <br/>\nforce a child into school who doesn&#39;t want to go. If they end up in court, <br/>\nhe&#39;s more likely to get his way than the children and mom are to get theirs. <br/>\nThe odds of getting a homeschool sympathetic court are pretty darn low.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70914754,"authorName":"Cheryl Flohe","from":"Cheryl Flohe &lt;cheryl98178@...&gt;","profile":"cheryl98178","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Port Townsend and sad family situation","postDate":"1042231238","msgId":11574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTEwMjA0MDM4LjYwNzc0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0NDA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDIyMDk1NDQuNDc5LjY2NDYxLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11625,"prevInTime":11573,"nextInTime":11575,"topicId":11574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Subject: Re: Digest Number 677 Hey!

I was recently up in Port Townsend to pick up<br/>\nour yurt!  You have the most adorable downtown<br/>\n(although I zipped in, got the yurt loaded up and<br/>\nzipped back out again to get to relatives near<br/>\nportland.)<br/>\nI wish I could have stayed longer!<br/>\nHeidi&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Port Townsend is a very cool town.  When we moved<br/>\nover to the Peninsula last summer from Seattle, Port<br/>\nTownsend was my first choice but unfortunately too<br/>\nexpensive.  Sequim is basically the next big town to<br/>\nthe west and that&#39;s where my parents live but then I<br/>\ndiscovered Port Angeles, a beautiful place also.  We<br/>\nfound this place just west of Port Angeles on March<br/>\n15th after the surprise snow storm in western WA and<br/>\nwe fell in love with this place before we walked in<br/>\nthe door...  a little snow all the way here and then<br/>\nas we drove up this road past farms, more and more<br/>\nsnow, until we got here to a log house on 10 acres and<br/>\na foot of snow!  The town is beautiful too and when<br/>\nyou drive out onto Ediz Hook almost to the Coast Guard<br/>\nstation and look back at the town of Port Angeles and<br/>\nat the Olympic Mountains towering over the town it<br/>\ntakes your breath away.  The kids (2 boys, one just<br/>\nturned 13 and the other is 9) and I love it here!  Not<br/>\nas many children to play with as living in a<br/>\nneighborhood but since we&#39;ve been homeschooling the<br/>\nlast couple years there weren&#39;t as many children to<br/>\nplay with anyway because they were either at school or<br/>\ndoing homework!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I also read the note about the sad<br/>\nsituation with the manipulative father and wanted to<br/>\nput my 2 cents in.  I saw a divorce lawyer about a<br/>\nyear ago and he said that the courts won&#39;t force a<br/>\nfamily to put the children in school so the Mom can go<br/>\nto work but they may adjust what the Mom gets if it&#39;s<br/>\nproven that she could make a certain amount of money<br/>\nby working outside the home and decides not to.  In my<br/>\ncase, I decided to move over here with the kids and my<br/>\nhusband stays in our trailer in Seattle coming home on<br/>\nweekends only.  Too long of a story for here but I<br/>\nfelt that it would work out better if I didn&#39;t have a<br/>\ndivorce situation where I had to send the kids to be<br/>\nalone with their Dad on weekends (VERY controlling!!).<br/>\n Anyway, just wanted to say that there are jobs a<br/>\nwoman can do from home now if there must be a divorce.<br/>\n It&#39;s also wonderful to have a positive influence<br/>\nfamily for those children to be around to show that<br/>\ntheir life at home is not the way it is in all<br/>\nfamilies. <br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11619,"nextTopicId":11577}}
