I do live in a constant state<br/>\nof amazement.  I sometimes feel twinges of<br/>\nembarrassment or regret when I let my enthusiasm carry<br/>\nme away, worrying that I have talked to much or<br/>\nsomething.  Then I shake myself, laugh and say &quot;who<br/>\ncares!&quot;  Better to live with that kid at Disneyland<br/>\nlook on your face, in love with the world at all<br/>\ntimes.  I try so hard to live in the moment, with that<br/>\nkind of passion, every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I agree with Deb.  I love to write<br/>\nand recieve long letters.  The internet is great for<br/>\ninformation and for instant contact with larger<br/>\ngroups.  But for meaningful, sustained, intimate<br/>\ncontact with friends at a distance, I prefer to use my<br/>\nown script and write long letters by hand.  I love to<br/>\nget them even more.  I wish I had more friends who<br/>\nwrote me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
