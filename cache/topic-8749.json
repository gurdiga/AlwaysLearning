At the time it was my husband <br/>\nwanting our son to get to algebra way early, but thankfully he backed off <br/>\nfrom that, partly because of what you said. However, just the other day a <br/>\nfriend of mine asked what I thought about her son doing algebra this year. <br/>\nHe&#39;s ten, a very bright, happy and funny boy. This is their first year <br/>\nhomeschooling and they&#39;re not unschoolers. The mom is really wanting to know <br/>\nif algebra is wrong for her son, though he wants it. He has already finished <br/>\nall the Saxon math books up to the point of algebra and wants to go on to <br/>\nthat. I had a vague memory of what you said then and looked it up in the <br/>\narchives. Here&#39;s the quote from you: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Oh dear. I don&#39;t have time right now, or I&#39;d go into a long rant about how <br/>\n </span></blockquote>dangerous it is to push kids into algebra before they are 13 or 14 or 15 at <br/>\nleast. It is worse than counterproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is &quot;algebraic thinking&quot; - that is fine -- kids do it pretty naturally <br/>\nanyway and it can be really satisfying and fun -- and there are ways for <br/>\nparents who aren&#39;t skilled in this area to encourage it in their children, <br/>\nbut that is VERY different than formal algebra studied in a systematic, <br/>\nstandard way. I have super strong opinions that that is a major mistake to <br/>\nstart early. I&#39;d try to find other mathematical things to do even for a kid <br/>\nwho was WANTING to study algebra -- there are so MANY other areas to explore <br/>\nthat are so much more appropriate and that a younger kid will get so much <br/>\nmore out of. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you elaborate a little on that? Explain your super stong opinions more? <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nPriss<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8745,"nextTopicId":8737}}
