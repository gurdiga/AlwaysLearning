We see it in other mammals all the time, but we have this <br/>\nancient tradition of denying our biological natures.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems there is brain activity that is being identified and measured and it <br/>\nturns on when a person is in love and it lasts until the object of desire is <br/>\nsecured, and the&#39;ve nested, and it seems they could procreate, and then it starts <br/>\nto wane.   There are (as with other brain-things) biochemical factors, and <br/>\nre-routing in the brain (shut down logical analysis of the situation until the <br/>\ngoal is met) and lots of cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first article I read I&#39;ve lost, but the guy was doing brain mapping AND <br/>\nas part of his evidence collecting was gathering song lyrics and poetry written <br/>\nby people who were trying to describe being in love, and looking for clues to <br/>\nhis theory that we really ARE different people in that state, or the same <br/>\npeople in an altered state.  After I read that I started listening for those <br/>\nkinds of clues too.  One day in the car Holly and I were listening to a collection <br/>\nof 60&#39;s stuff, and here came this:<br/>\n&quot;I feel it in my fingers <br/>\nI feel  it in my toes<br/>\nLove is all around me<br/>\nand so the feeling grows.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope he had that in his collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a couple of months later we saw Love Actually, in which that song is <br/>\npractically a main character! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the original research, but it&#39;s similar enough that after Carol <br/>\nNarigon and I discussed the idea in general, she found this and sent it to me:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1105827,00.html\">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1105827,00.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(If it&#39;s not still there maybe I can cut and paste, but that&#39;s not working so <br/>\nwell for me today! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17967,"nextTopicId":18473}}
