It can be from one week to the<br/>\nnext, one day to the next.  Seeing what your kids are doing, is a key<br/>\naspect to really understanding how each individual child learns. <br/>\nWithout that, you really will have a hard time knowing how to add more<br/>\nto it that will really encourage and enrich that child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Think how different that is from our typical schooling<br/>\n </span></blockquote>experiences......you have a test 2x a week to let you &gt;know where you<br/>\nare with &quot;results&quot;.

Not all day, but every day. The goal isn&#39;t to get the new mount, none of us are high enough for a mount, yet. Our playing isn&#39;t particularly goal oriented. It is more about playing together, calling a friend or skype-ing another and playing as a group. We help each other or one of us will wander off for a quest, calling out when assistance is needed or when a special something was found that they KNOW will help someone else&#39;s character out. It is community and fellowship and a lot of joy. Occasionally there is frustration or jealousy or moments when getting up and moving are better than sitting down and playing. There is humor, oh, I don&#39;t know, there is so much more than just playing a game together. Or maybe that is all there is. Like playing Life or Monopoly or chess, maybe it is just like that, like the conversations and the stories and the companionship. When I was a child my<br/>\n family would go on extended family camping trips. Canasta played a big role in those extended family camping trips. Lots of competition, some hurt feelings; I can remember by Aunt Jamie crying when my dad and my grandmother trounced her and whomever else she was partnered with. Nobody questioned the value of those games. It was encouraged. It was fun and challenging and thoughtful. Just like World of Warcraft can be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;I&#39;d hate to fail at this&quot;","postDate":"1206668080","msgId":33751,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzaGh2ZyttMmIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwZjQ4NzU2MDgwMzI3MTEwNng3ZDdmYjE1Y245YTljZDYwNjEzYTA5MTUwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33747,"nextInTopic":33768,"prevInTime":33750,"nextInTime":33752,"topicId":33705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This may be obvious to<br/>\nmany here, particularly the veterans, but it was a good insight for me that<br/>\nI think might help others. This is why I tend to think of unschooling as<br/>\n&quot;cooperative life learning&quot; - even if while cooperating different<br/>\nindividuals within the family might take on different roles (i.e. child<br/>\ndiscovers an interest, parent facilitates its pursuit) it emphasizes that<br/>\naspect of &quot;can&#39;t fail this&quot; to me, not in the sense that the person who<br/>\nemailed it meant it, but because it&#39;s literally impossible to fail!  I think<br/>\none of the best points you raised was that all the reading or discussing in<br/>\nthe world is not what makes a difference, but what you actually do with it<br/>\nin your interactions with your children (this is obviously my own<br/>\ninterpretation of what you said, what I got from it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder if the person who feared &quot;failing at this&quot; was just expressing<br/>\na feeling of being overwhelmed by the enormity of the change between their<br/>\ncurrent or recent situation and the unshcooling lifestyle? If so, I can<br/>\nidentify with that, and perhaps offer some reassurance that even very<br/>\npositive transitions are still transitions and thus expected to cause some<br/>\nstress almost by definition. Sure, losses such as divorce and death are<br/>\namong the top-rated stress causes usually listed, but so are weddings and<br/>\nbirths and adoptions, and I would add that for a parent conscientious enough<br/>\nabout their child&#39;s education to even be marginally interested in<br/>\nunschooling, taking the actual leap, particularly if the kids have been<br/>\nattending school thus far, would be up there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for &quot;you&#39;re getting warm/you&#39;re getting cold&quot;, I find that an extremely<br/>\nuseful guide for keeping the focus on the important stuff, and I plan to use<br/>\nit! Only wish that this was more often as obvious as it can be sometimes -<br/>\nwish I could have a thermometer of sorts to gauge how choices stand against<br/>\nthe final goal, if you know what I mean? It&#39;s not even just about knowing<br/>\nwhere you want to go, IMO, even though that of course is essential, but<br/>\nsometimes the questions of how to get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot; are not as clear.<br/>\nFor the times when it&#39;s clear though, which are clearly many, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll<br/>\nbe superbly helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if anyone else has had that feeling of &quot;OK, I *know* where I want<br/>\nto get, but I&quot;m not sure if this is getting me warmer, right now, or<br/>\ncolder&quot;? And how do you deal with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Mar 27, 2008 at 10:12 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I had an e-mail I&#39;m going to paraphrase and leave anonymous.

I haven&#39;t had a pair I liked. I<br/>\n&gt; like Wolkys, but honestly they look a little like old lady shoes, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little like an old lady so I don&#39;t really mind. They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; expensive, but I don&#39;t wear my shoes out very quickly at all; they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; last years or the rest of my life. So if in a conversation where<br/>\n&gt; shoe recommendations come through, some of that might be said. It<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t matter who said what, what&#39;s going to matter is that you<br/>\n&gt; had more input before deciding yourself what to do. You might not<br/>\n&gt; want either kind. You might have young feet and strong ankles and<br/>\n&gt; can do with flip flops another few years, or some fancy sandals with<br/>\n&gt; heels. We don&#39;t even need to know!
