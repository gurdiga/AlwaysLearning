I know it&#39;s not ideal, but given my life situation at the moment, it&#39;s kind of a miracle I&#39;ve even had the strength and courage to take one of my kids out of school. This list has been a huge support - Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a mom to two kids, a boy, age 8, and a girl, age 5. My son was put into a special ed classroom for kindergarten, mainstreamed for 1st and 2nd, and I have taken him out of school a month ago, as I realize that environment is not loving or kind to him. He is doing way better emotionally not attending school. So much pressure has been lessened. He laughs. He looks me in the eye. He talks about things he&#39;s interested in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter likes kindergarten. She is outgoing and social and kids and teachers like her. As far as I can tell, she is not being scarred, punished, demeaned, or disrespected by teachers or administrators the way my son was.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor many reasons, it is easier for me unschool my son alone and send my daughter to school. I see school as a babysitter for her, really. I can take my son to work with me, most of the time, but I cannot take both kids to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\nMiranda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72808,"nextTopicId":7465}}
