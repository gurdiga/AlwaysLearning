That was six years ago, but when I was on the board over 75% of my<br/>\ndistrict&#39;s expenses were driven by teacher, support staff and custodial<br/>\nsalaries and health insurance. I think that&#39;s probably still true.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the other costs, like special ed costs and other requirements from<br/>\nthe state or federal government, were out of our control - they were<br/>\ndelineated by state or federal regulations. When we wanted to cut the<br/>\nbudget, guess where we could cut - books/learning materials and building<br/>\nmaintenance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat drove my district&#39;s budgets up were mainly increases in healthcare<br/>\ncosts. The school board actually had (in my time) very little control over<br/>\nthe budget except during teacher contract negotiations, when we could try to<br/>\nswitch the teachers to a lower cost healthcare plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI began homeschooling the year No Child Left Behind was implemented. I still<br/>\nlive in the same small town, so still cross paths with many people who work<br/>\nin the schools - the school is the second largest employer in my town.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey tell me that salaries and health insurance continue to drive the budget<br/>\n(I don&#39;t know how the recent healthcare bill will affect that) and now<br/>\nthere&#39;s the added administrative costs of NCLB. They all hate NCLB.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrivate schools can keep their costs down by offering low salaries and maybe<br/>\nnot providing health insurance. They don&#39;t need to comply with NCLB, the<br/>\nspecial ed laws and other federal regulations. In my state (NH) there is<br/>\nless state regulation of private schools than there is of homeschoolers. And<br/>\nreligious schools are often subsidized through their church or denomination.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding population growth - Though it will vary from town to town (some<br/>\nplaces are more attractive to families than others) we&#39;re currently in a<br/>\npopulation &quot;lull&quot; in the schools. For the most part the baby boomers&#39; kids<br/>\nhave passed through K-12.

A few years ago I did a reading project on school financing. It was very interesting, and of course by now I don&#39;t remember a lot of it. I remember that a lot of money that schools get from various sources comes with strings attached--it&#39;s for a specific purpose, and not available for other things. So one frustration schools might experience is that they have, say, a big federal grant to upgrade computers but what they really need is a new roof, but there&#39;s no money for capital improvements, and no way to shift money from new computers they may not need to the roof they really do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I remember is that the size of administrative staffs has dramatically outpaced growth in student populations in recent decades. One big difference that some researchers found is that Catholic school systems have tiny administrative staffs compared to similar-sized public school systems serving the same number of students. So one place the money is going is into (bloated?) bureaucracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How are School Funds Spent? was Re: Take your [child] to work day!","postDate":"1272146675","msgId":53373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3NjM4LjU3NDk1LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxdm1rbStmNGYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxdm1rbStmNGYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53370,"nextInTopic":53377,"prevInTime":53372,"nextInTime":53374,"topicId":53274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I don t think that there s a secret society of people somewhere coming up with ways to take our children away and put them in schools so they can be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1568586381\">***I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a secret society of people somewhere coming up with ways to take our children away and put them in schools so they can be indoctrinated.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not secret at all, it&#39;s very blatant.

Teacher contracts and all other school related contracts come with salary increases and set costs that increase over time whether or not the increases are affordable or not.  So, like now, in an economic downturn, those contracts are still there and being renegotiated.  Unless the tax structure changes, the money to meet that may or may not be there.  Here, where I live, when the state is facing a budget shortfall and the current tax structure takes 60% of tax dollars to fund education and almost every tax dollar comes from income and property, well you can see how they&#39;d be unable to meet those contracts and renegotiations.  There is a very high unemployment rate here and the housing market was hit hard, the 2 main sources of funding for education.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of restructuring the monsterous beast of educational funding, it&#39;s easier to raise taxes.  All tax ads have to do is make people scared that schools will close and that their children will lose out on their fundamental right to a good education.  Done and done.  It just happened here.  Yet, here&#39;s the really sad thing, with all that extra tax money the state just received, they are still going to lay off a huge amount of teachers and close a huge amount of schools.  This happens ALL the time.  People get used to living in a feeling of scarcity and fear.  Our culture helps to maintain that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see that in many of the backlash of criticism to unschooling being in the news.  The very fact that people have chosen NOT to accept that into their lives makes it hard for those that do, to accept it or even acknowledge that it CAN be another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found as a pleasant side effect to unschooling is the idea of living in abundance.  It&#39;s a powerful feeling.  Even when money is tight and my own family struggles financially, we STILL live in abundance, it&#39;s a state of being and thinking that changes EVERYthing!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"How are School Funds Spent? was Re: Take your [child] to work day!","postDate":"1272132303","msgId":53356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhxdmJzZis1ZHJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZBNDJCRjEzNDYxODQ5NDU4RjQzRTMwQzc1RTJFOUE2QEVkUEM+"},"prevInTopic":53337,"nextInTopic":53358,"prevInTime":53355,"nextInTime":53357,"topicId":53274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have no idea where the money is going.

A third of what I&#39;d get would go to health insurance and that would be just for me not my family.  Considering what I pay for my family&#39;s health insurance now I&#39;m thinking it would take almost my entire retirement income to pay for health insurance.  Some in some districts might live really well on retirement but most of the ones in my district HAVE to get another job just to make ends meet.  The other way they might be living well is their own retirement investments.  I know the ones in my district that retire without getting another job have lived frugally and invested their own funds into independent retirement accounts just like others in the work world do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool district employees from my district also pay into social security but I would not be eligible for that until - what? - age 67 or 70?  or some such like every one else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state of MO is weird in that St Louis and Kansa City school districts do not belong to the state teacher&#39;s retirement fund - so we have to pay into both Social Security and the district retirement fund and then most of us try to put something of our own away too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, there is money going into retirement funds - same as with many jobs - though that seems to be changing in recent years - my sister is a nurse and she pays into a retirement fund at the hospital.  One of my mother&#39;s husband&#39;s (one of 4) retired from some type of plumbing job and lived really well on that retirement and his own savvy investing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a host of other things most people do not think about districts paying for - at least the larger districts - the small rural districts probably don&#39;t waste as much money IMO - : paying for lawyers, buying out Superintendent&#39;s contracts that the school board no longer wants to keep employed (huge amounts of money - done several times while I&#39;ve been here the past 23 years)  employee travel to training and events that are supposed to help the district progress and improve ;)  it goes on and on.  I see a lot of waste - then turn around and spend my own money to be able to do the activities I want with the children.   I just spent $50.00 at the grocery store tonight for some activities to go along with our trip to a dairy next week.  I&#39;ve bought pencils just so my children had pencils to write with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - the formula for retirement in my district (maybe the state - not sure on that) is your age plus years in the district have to equal 75 to be eligible.  THEN there is another formula to figure out how much you would get - so the average of your salary for the last 4 years times how long you&#39;ve been in the district  times .02 would determine how much you&#39;d get.  After 30 years you get no more credit in the figuring of your funds - in other words if you work for 40 years they would use 30 as the number of years employed.  I figure I&#39;ll not stay past 30 which is in 7 years.  I&#39;ll be 55 and I&#39;ll find something else to do at that point if not before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least this way - being a teacher - I get maximum family time.  Summers off, 2 weeks at Christmas, spring break, a few three day weekends, I can be home by 3:45 if I need to be.  I love working with the children.  There are perks that benefit my family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Take your [child] to work day!   another (yet similar) topic","postDate":"1272057794","msgId":53317,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwNTU5MC43MjQ5OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxRDA2NTlDLTQzOUEtNDlFNS1CMDk1LURERUYzMTMyRTEzNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhxcXIxNytuOTVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjFEMDY1OUMtNDM5QS00OUU1LUIwOTUtRERFRjMxMzJFMTM1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53316,"nextInTopic":53333,"prevInTime":53316,"nextInTime":53318,"topicId":53274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Another place it might be going ( anyone who knows, feel free to add or correct) is retirement funds for retired teachers.*** That is the unspoken reason","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1695631698\">***Another place it might be going ( anyone who knows, feel free to add <br/>\nor correct) is retirement funds for retired teachers.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the unspoken reason why the state of OR is bankrupt.

Some of them are one child and two teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not only parents who pay school taxes.

I&#39;m sure the  <br/>\ngeneral plan was that retirement funds would &quot;fund&quot; themselves, but  <br/>\ncontracts are contracts.

I guess it shouldn&#39;t shock me, but it does. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Some administrators said they recognized that spending time with  <br/>\n&gt; their parents at work could be a valuable educational experience for  <br/>\n&gt; children, but it does not justify pulling them out of the classroom   <br/>\n&gt; even for one day.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Stakes have never been higher for student achievement,&quot; wrote  <br/>\n&gt; Virginia B.
