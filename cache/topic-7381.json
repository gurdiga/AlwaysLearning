She was a poet and a self-proclaimed <br/>\n  &quot;adventurer&quot;.  I have a newspaper clipping - very old and yellowed - about <br/>\n  her climbing Mt. Fuji in Japan when she was 90 years old.  When asked why she <br/>\n  did it, she replied, &quot;because I never had before&quot;.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just love that - isn&#39;t it amazing how a name can hold so much value. I have had a lot of positive responses from people when they ask what my daughters&#39; name is and I can see immediately how that positive energy transfers over to my daughter. With my son his name is Cameron and he is full of sooo much energy ( alot more than most people can handle) and my family nicknamed him Camacazzie - I felt that this had negative connations attached when they would call him that in front of people we had only just met. I felt that an unfair judgement would be predetermined just from the name so I had to ask them to stop calling him that as I did not like the label and what it implied.<br/>\n  Sue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

We live in Brisbane Australia and my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-412115704\">Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new on the list. My name is Sue and I have 2 children Cameron 3 1/2 yrs old and Josephine 20 months. We live in Brisbane Australia and my partner Kevin and myself are interested in homeschooling our children. We practice attachment parenting and found that we had to make a complete life change once we had our children ie/ Kev has given away the corporate life so as to spend more time with the family and we have moved from one side of Australia to the other to incorporate travel in our children&#39;s and our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I was asked how I have planned to homeschool my children etc. and I responded with - hopefully natural learning - I&#39;ll just follow the leads of my children - to which I was told that this was unschooling - well I am totally niave when it comes to labelling as I always thought that unschooling was taking children out of school and trying to reverse it&#39;s affects and that homeschooling was that your children learn at home with there being many different options - ie/ curriculum, natural learning etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only gather from reading the last few emails on this list that I was wrong in my thoughts and I am looking forward to reading and learning more. My hope is that I want to be able to follow my childrens lead - so far we go on lots of nature walks because that is what they and we as a family love to do, and the kids just play. I always assumed that the first 7 years of a childs&#39; life is about play and I wasn&#39;t preparing myself to teach them to read or write or count out of the ordinary - ie/ when baking a cake we would count eggs or when collecting rocks we would count rocks but I haven&#39;t gone out of my way as to sit their and try and teach Cam to read etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n We do lots of reading ourselves so they see their parents reading a lot but Cam doesn&#39;t show the interest in it - my daughter however does. So, I was just going to follow their lead and if it took Cameron until he was 10 to take an interest - well then so be it. At the moment he is interested in the stars and the moon and he saw a telescope in a magazine that I had. He asked what it was and I told him and then he said that he wanted one so that we can look at the stars at night and go camping. So, since all of us where interested in it we have decided to save our pennies together and this has created even more interest for him and bonded us all the more. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment Cam gets $3 per week - we bank half of it and the other half he saves for things like the telescope or for a ride at the shop. We introduced this method as everytime we went to the shop he would perform wanting everything - so we decided to give him his own money and so when he wanted something we told him that he would have to save for it. - it has worked wonders because now we don&#39;t have the tantrums because he knows that he has a means now for obtaining it (well not as many tantrums &lt;lol&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I know my children are young but since I am new at this I still have some concerns that maybe I am going about things wrong ie/ am I being too laxed in their education, should I be teaching them to read soon, am I missing out on the window period or are there any helpful hints and suggestions that anyone can provide for me in the natural learning way?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do get these doubts every now and then that I may be doing it all wrong so any input will be helpful and I am not the least bit worried about someone being very blunt or direct with me as challenge to ones belief is always on the path to better understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to check out what unschooling is all about - thanks for listening<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174971760,"authorName":"Cynthia Jac.","from":"&quot;Cynthia Jac.&quot; &lt;cynthia1854@...&gt;","profile":"cynthia1854","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new member","postDate":"1078331505","msgId":18930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMzAzMTYzMTQ1LjIzNjUucW1haWxAd2ViMjE0MTIubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14897,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":18929,"nextInTime":18931,"topicId":7381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cynthia here, I have two sons.
