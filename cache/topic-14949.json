Finally I said, &quot;You know how I <br/>\nalways talk about people who believe in hell are the only ones afraid of <br/>\ngetting there? I was being sarcastic.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThey got me rolling once again when they said, &quot;Oh like the bumper sticker <br/>\nthat says &#39;It&#39;s your hell, you burn in it.&#39;?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;Yep, that&#39;s it!&quot; And LMAO the whole ride home.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - And if you wonder why I say &quot;They&quot; when Kass & Kree speak it is <br/>\nbecause they totally do the twin thing where they speak parts of sentences, one <br/>\nstarts, the other fiinishes.
