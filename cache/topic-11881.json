I have also been letting go of coercion and embracing autonomy. It has been a long road, and I don&#39;t think my 2 adult daughters would recognise my parenting! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe began Home educating almost 3 years ago. As soon as I found out about unschooling I knew that was what was best for my family. I read John Holt and bought my daughter Grace Lilly&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation handbook&quot;. She never read much of it, but I got heaps out of it! My husband was less convinced, but having little time to *teach* the *basics* he considered important, things were left mostly to me. He has since changed his mind, thank goodness!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs time has gone by, I have gained confidence and don&#39;t suffer from many HE related fears. I was absolutely terrified when we were notified of our first ERO (Educational Review Office) visit. In New Zealand one of these govt review officers comes to make sure your children are &quot;being taught as regularly and as well as in a registered school&quot;. This is the only legal requirement for home educating here. My children had been doing *nothing* for 2 years by most people&#39;s standards. It sounds scary, but once armed with information, a sound educational philosophy and confidence, it is OK. That doesn&#39;t make it any less intrusive or offensive, but there is no need to fear it. On this first occasion though I had not reached that point and I coerced my children into producing some *work* for the reviewer. I will never ever do this again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have also blossomed. My boys are still more interested in playing strategy games on the computer that anything else, but I have come to accept this and no longer place judgements on their interests. (Jan Fortune-Wood in her book &quot;Doing it their way&quot; really helped here). As you say, Ren, they really enjoy it when I join in and have a game. It&#39;s more fun than I thought, and I am amazed at the skill my boys have developed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething has happened that I thought impossible....I have stopped trying to force my kids to do chores (almost all the time, not perfect yet &lt;g&gt;) and have cheerfully done these things myself instead. Now I have a tidier house, I seem to have more time now that I am not nagging anyone else to do things that *I* want done and, wonder of wonders, the children have started helping spontaneously and happily agreeing to polite requests for help (I am willing to accept a &quot;no&quot; when I ask). Now that I am treating them with true respect, I am getting it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is only in the last couple of months that Trevor (now 13) has begun to <br/>\n  really blossom as far as interests................. When Trevor was being coerced, he had no reason to be inspired or to take <br/>\n  ownership of anything.
