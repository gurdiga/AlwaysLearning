Though he doesn&#39;t really talk about it, I get the feeling that<br/>\nhe spent those few years after the military (I met him a few years into this<br/>\nphase) reacting/rebelling subconsciously (by partying and doing whatever the<br/>\nhell he wanted to) to the controlling home that he never recovered from<br/>\nright after high school because he entered the military.  He spent those<br/>\nyears working and partying and he ended up renting a home with my<br/>\nx-boyfriend and two other people who were just out of high school and<br/>\nentering the work force.  (My x-boyfriend had been a Senior when I was a<br/>\nSophomore which is much more acceptable)  Anyway, this was the place to<br/>\nparty and we met there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I finished high school, which seemed to take forever, we went to the<br/>\nsame 2 year college together and after the first year I married him so I<br/>\ncould move in with him in.  I thought that if I didn&#39;t marry him my mom<br/>\nwould freak out.  But then my older sister, who never did anything wrong,<br/>\nmoved in with her boyfriend and it was okay.  But I had been afraid to.  By<br/>\nthe time we went off to college, neither of us was into partying much<br/>\nanymore.  We buckled down, worked jobs off and on campus to support<br/>\nourselves, and got our degrees and went on with our lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy reaction to all the typical control of childhood was not to rebel so much<br/>\nas to just want to break free.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been work being married for 21 years.  It hasn&#39;t always been easy but<br/>\nwe&#39;ve always been comfortable around each other.  Over time and slowly, he&#39;s<br/>\ncome to realize that the way I treat the kids works much better than the way<br/>\nhe was treated as a kid. (and when he was frustrated would treat our kids)<br/>\nIt was slow at times but he steadily moved toward a more peaceful way of<br/>\nbeing with the girls and the other day when he called, (works on the road a<br/>\nlot) he told me what a good mother I am and said that whatever I am doing it<br/>\nis working because when he talks to everyone else at all the different<br/>\nplaces he works they have nothing nice to say about their teens/pre-teens<br/>\nand he thinks ours are great.  (and they are!)  We all live in peace and<br/>\ntreat each other respectfully and we talk about our feelings and find<br/>\nsolutions to problems that work for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house isn&#39;t always clean.  (ok hardly ever)  Supper doesn&#39;t make it to<br/>\nthe table very often. (and sometimes it has fur in it, lol)  But we connect<br/>\nevery day. We share time together with our animals.  I help the girls when<br/>\nthey ride.  Get them to lessons. We hang out with their friends.  (I noticed<br/>\nI was the only mom on one of those emails, &quot;get to know your friends&quot; that<br/>\none of the girls&#39; friends sent around the other day..the rest were all<br/>\nteens)  I pick up friends, drop them off, let them spend the week-ends.  We<br/>\nplay on-line games together.  We enjoy being with each other.  My kids&#39;<br/>\nfriends love to be here and they include me when we all hang out.

He updated his MySpace stuff and wrote<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeroes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are people who I would much rather be like, or who I<br/>\nthink are super cool. The real heroes of my life are my friends and<br/>\nfamily. I&#39;ve learned basically everything I know from or as a direct<br/>\ncause of them. Friends are great. Currently, my biggest hero(es) are<br/>\nmy girlfriend, and her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in a blog post he wrote:<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m happy with the things that have gone well recently, namely Holly<br/>\nand her wonderful family, the Dodds. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n=========================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHis parents are not nice to him.  The last time he had dinner with  <br/>\nhis dad (when his recovering-from-suicide sister was in town), he  <br/>\ntold his dad he was planning to move away from  his cynical,  <br/>\npessimistic, depressing roommate (they&#39;ve been roommates almost all  <br/>\nof  seven years, at two universities and more than one house)--and  <br/>\nmoving into our house for a while.    His dad said &quot;Aren&#39;t you  <br/>\nashamed of your life?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat his dad wants him to be ashamed of is dropping out of grad  <br/>\nschool and not becoming a PhD or a doctor.  Brett turned 24 not long  <br/>\nago.  He&#39;s been pressured since he was four years old and they put  <br/>\nhim in school early so he could be a doctor sooner and ultimately  <br/>\nmake more money  His parents divorced when he was six.  He&#39;s been  <br/>\nvariously shunted, neglected and indulged (if things and money  <br/>\ncounted), and they treat him like a bad child no matter what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t know how to relax or to breathe hopefully or to live  <br/>\nhappily,  yet he is very patient and thoughtful and sweet.   I told  <br/>\nhim he needed remedial intact family.  It was my idea for him to move  <br/>\nin here, for a while at least.  His living situation was ending, and  <br/>\nhis family and roommate were a huge energy suck anyway.  The last job  <br/>\nhe had (contract work in a medical research lab) paid $14 or $15.   <br/>\nWhen he told his dad, his dad laughed at him and said &quot;Our nanny  <br/>\nmakes more than that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPoor guy.   But he&#39;s a sweetie and Holly loves him, and they seem  <br/>\nreally good for each other.  He&#39;s been a good friend of Kirby&#39;s for  <br/>\nfour or five years, and of Marty&#39;s nearly that long.  It&#39;s been a  <br/>\nyear and a day since he and Holly decided they were best friends.    <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t turn romantic or into being a couple until a few months  <br/>\nafter she was 16.  (Yes, it&#39;s legal, we checked.  One of my former  <br/>\nSCA students is now the assistant D.A. in charge of violent crimes,  <br/>\nand he has the jury instructions memorized.  If Brett worked in a  <br/>\nschool in which Holly were enrolled, or a medical facility in which  <br/>\nshe was a patient, it would be a violation of law.   She&#39;s not in a  <br/>\nschool or a hospital, and he doesn&#39;t work in either anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are photos of them here (and one of me and Keith, too):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/09/cotton-candy.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/09/cotton-candy.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one she took of them here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/10/glory-of-holly-and-friday-fill-\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2008/10/glory-of-holly-and-friday-fill-</a> <br/>\nins.html<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s different.
