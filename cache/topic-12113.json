During those seven years I felt defined by being<br/>\n&quot;mentally ill&quot;, like that was the whole of my existence, and I felt<br/>\npretty helpless to change any of it. On the other side, it felt like<br/>\nwhatever I did didn&#39;t matter, since I was mentally ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings started to change when I found the mental health consumer<br/>\nmovement, and started hanging out with those folks. I went to a<br/>\nconference at UC Berkeley and met peope like Howie the Harp and found<br/>\nsome sense of power.  Now I think I consider my episodic depression and<br/>\ndissociative symptoms as not &quot;normal&quot;, but just as part of me, like my<br/>\nasthma and my myopia. I&#39;d be happy to have all of them fixed, but since<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t seem to be possible now I go ahead and treat the symptoms so<br/>\nthat I can function better. I also tell people I&#39;m close to that I have<br/>\nthese issues, Rain knows what to do if I have an asthma attack and can&#39;t<br/>\ntalk, my two best friends came up this fall and gently reminded my that<br/>\n&#39;twas the season that my seasonal depression usually hit...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I can pretty much pass &lt;g&gt;, although the first few years I spent<br/>\nout of institutios I felt like there was a huge scarlet C for crazy on my<br/>\nforehead. I&#39;m thinking that most of the folks on this list who know me in<br/>\n&quot;real life&quot; didn&#39;t know all that....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; About &quot;clinical depression,&quot; I&#39;ve been there too.

It&#39;s okay with me. When<br/>\nI was younger it was a bigger deal, but now it&#39;s okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nRain and both fight over our &quot;Why Be Normal?&quot; coffee mug, and she<br/>\ninstantly glommed on lines from the Fantasticks about &quot;Please, God, don&#39;t<br/>\nlet me be *normal*&quot;.

In some school<br/>\n&gt; districts, 20 percent of the students are medicated,<br/>\n&gt; lining up each day at the<br/>\n&gt; nurse&#39;s office to receive their midday dose. With<br/>\n&gt; such staggering numbers, one<br/>\n&gt; would think there is indisputable evidence that ADD<br/>\n&gt; exists and that Ritalin is<br/>\n&gt; the ideal way to treat it. But the exact opposite is<br/>\n&gt; true. The ADD Hoax is an<br/>\n&gt; in-depth look at the crime being committed against<br/>\n&gt; our children--children who<br/>\n&gt; are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADD and then exposed to the<br/>\n&gt; effects of Ritalin, a drug<br/>\n&gt; with massive distribution that is matched in volume<br/>\n&gt; only by the number of<br/>\n&gt; uncertainties surrounding it. This up-to-date book<br/>\n&gt; chronicles the ADD hoax and<br/>\n&gt; gives parents and other concerned people the<br/>\n&gt; necessary ammunition to fight this<br/>\n&gt; epidemic of mistreatment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; News in Brain and Behavioural Sciences - Issue 84 -<br/>\n&gt; 25th January, 2003<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://human-nature.com/nibbs/issue84.html\">http://human-nature.com/nibbs/issue84.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
