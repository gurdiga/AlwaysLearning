(Really. I would come through the internet and hug you if I could, and if that were the kind of thing that was OK with you. Because so many non-gender-typical kids have it so rough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s unlikely that your daughter is in a &quot;phase&quot;--kids often have a really clear sense of who they are from a very young age (when I was pregnant with Eric, friends asked if we were going to avoid gender pronouns etc. with our children, and David said, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to go with the apparent biological sex. The kid will let us know soon enough if we&#39;re wrong.&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I might not talk too much about a youngish child being &quot;transgender,&quot; for reasons that don&#39;t have much to do with labeling. One is that the child might prefer to be referred to as a girl. I know that David isn&#39;t typically &quot;out&quot; as transsexual in his life (even though we were VERY out as lesbians prior to his transition) because he just wants people to see him as a guy. I can imagine a child who feels herself to be a girl feeling invalidated or &quot;othered&quot; (I hate that word but can&#39;t think of a better one this second) by being called transgendered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it may be less challenging for friends and family to talk about it, not as a phase, but as the place she is right now that you have decided to support her in 100%. They may be able to accept that more readily, since people often have a really hard time believing kids know themselves and what&#39;s right for them. You might get a lot of push-back if you call your child transgendered that you might not get otherwise. I don&#39;t know for sure, though. These are just thoughts. It could be possible that the opposite is true, that using the term &quot;transgendered&quot; would give family and friends a lens to look through that would help them understand and accept your child. Certainly it gives them something to google. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, affirming your 7-year-old&#39;s sense that she is a girl is very powerful, brave, and respectful. If your child&#39;s sense of herself as a girl persists, you&#39;ll have to make decisions with her about things like pre-puberty interventions that increase the chances of her growing up with the kind of body and voice that will allow her to be perceived in the world as the person she knows herself to be. &quot;Transgendered&quot; doesn&#39;t strike me as a label in the same way that &quot;ADHD,&quot; &quot;dyslexic,&quot; &quot;oppositional,&quot; &quot;lazy,&quot; etc. do--it&#39;s not thrown around casually, it&#39;s not over-applied in schools, it&#39;s not ever a stand-in for &quot;this is a child we find challenging and we want to put the onus on her to accommodate herself to our needs,&quot; it&#39;s not a judgment or a pre-applied limit on what she can accomplish. In the case of a child like yours, it&#39;s an affirmation that she is who she knows herself to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo child ever self-identifies as ADHD or learning disabled before an adult applies that label. No kid is ever empowered by saying, &quot;I&#39;m lazy,&quot; and the parent saying, &quot;You&#39;re right, and I&#39;m going to make sure all your friends and family know it.&quot; But a child IS empowered when they say, &quot;My body says I&#39;m female but I KNOW I&#39;m male,&quot; and the parent says, &quot;You&#39;re right, and I&#39;m going to help you navigate that in the world so you can be strong and healthy in that identity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt strikes me as a different kind of thing altogether as I think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Labels [AlwaysLearning] Re: Random bursts of hyperactivity","postDate":"1277591007","msgId":55306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVGRkRDRDA2LUIxQkYtNDg1RS04QzEwLTE2NDYwODcwMjY0MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkwNXBhNCs3Y2d0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkwNXBhNCs3Y2d0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55305,"nextInTopic":55309,"prevInTime":55305,"nextInTime":55307,"topicId":55284,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That was one of those parenting epiphanies I had years ago, to rephrase to let my child know what I wanted rather than what I didn&#39;t want.  It&#39;s so ingrained in me that I still catch myself.
