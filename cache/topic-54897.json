David and I have been talking about how Eric will be looking forward to having him home on the weekend and then be a mess all weekend long, fussy, complaining, combative, mildly tantrum-y. Our working theory right now is that it&#39;s because he has this vision of how the day will go and any little thing that doesn&#39;t match up throws him off (like David having breakfast, showering, and doing his chores when Eric was imagining him sitting right down immediately to play a video game together). We&#39;re hoping that having some discussion on Thursday and Friday about what the day will look like might help him go into it having more realistic expectations--knowing that his dad _will_ spend a lot of time with him, but not every minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of thing you describe with playing with your daughter used to happen more often when he was younger--I think often he didn&#39;t have a clear notion of what he was expecting, just that once something started (drawing the picture in your case), that wasn&#39;t it, and because of his temperament it was very hard for him to deal with that disconnect between what he wanted and what was without exploding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard with the younger ones. I found the book The Explosive Child really helpful in thinking about how to respond to Eric; I think the very respectful approach that books suggests really helped us preserve a strong relationship and let Eric build skills of flexibility over time in a really positive way. The basic idea is that you reduce stresses and demands on the child in every area possible, letting go of expectations as much as possible, so they&#39;re not constantly at the limit of their tolerance, making it easier for them to cope with the things that really matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote about the book on my blog awhile ago, if you want to read a summary. It&#39;s here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tapeflags.blogspot.com/2010/03/explosive-child.html\">http://tapeflags.blogspot.com/2010/03/explosive-child.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an unschooling book but it&#39;s a very unschooling-friendly book. The author&#39;s ideas about reducing your demands on your child is pretty counter to mainstream ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wonder if there are other things you can do with your daughter that would dodge the &quot;mom, you&#39;re doing it wrong!&quot; effect. A craft project where your job is to hand her supplies or cut out the shapes or something. Or an outing where the focus is outside the two of you--you&#39;re looking at something together or doing an activity designed by someone else together. I&#39;m not a genius at coming up with this kind of thing, and if your daughter is like Eric it might be very hard for her to accept alternatives, but it&#39;s just a thought I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Doesn&#39;t want to be alone?","postDate":"1276522603","msgId":54945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGludHhsQk5HdmZBWXlXbU1rYW5rbFB6YU1IdUpOczJCeUZIaFhscEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4NjYyNi40MzIyNC5xbUB3ZWI1MjYwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGh2M2ZiNis0b281QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MjQ0N0Y5ODNCRkM0NDI4N0ExRDBCNUQxODNFNkE1RDJAdGFtYXJhPgk8Mjg2NjI2LjQzMjI0LnFtQHdlYjUyNjA0Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54943,"nextInTopic":54947,"prevInTime":54944,"nextInTime":54946,"topicId":54897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And I like cheating/helping too much for good reasons like this.

Maybe she could put her hand on top of yours and help guide the crayon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf drawing continues to be a sore spot, there&#39;s nothing wrong with telling her that&#39;s not fun for you right now and offering an alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Often she wants me to play two of her toys talking to each other while she just watches (and tells me what each of them should say), which I find really hard.===<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are excellent directors [g].

If drawing and playing with certain toys are a common go-to mommy-n-daughter activity, those may have negative connotations for both of you right now. Ditch &#39;em and try some different activities.

It helps to play for some time just like she wants it, to just go with the flow of her game. To support her wish for power and to surrender almost, with love. For my daughter (who is the youngest by far, even in the extended family), it was very empowering, and now at 8 she almost never needs to be so controlling anymore.<br/>\nIt was the same with games, even the possibility of losing a game would distract and frighten her so much that no game was fun. And by making her win always, by changing rules in her advantage or cheating outright, and not minding it, it made her be less controlling and now she doesn&#39;t mind to loose in well known games. A new game, makes her want to win, until she gets used to it.<br/>\nI was afraid, because of people around me saying that in this way she would never learn how to loose, but for her it was an important stage, to feel her power to control a situation, a power to win, and because everybody around her was older, it was not always easy to get this power in another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thuisschool.wordpress.com/\">http://thuisschool.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Rinelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rinelle@...\">rinelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Mon, June 14, 2010 1:16:53 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Doesn&#39;t want to be alone?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nThanks everyone for the suggestions, it&#39;s beginning to help me get some <br/>\nclarity on what exactly is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that at least part of the issue is probably that I am not spending <br/>\nenough concentrated time with my daughter.

We&#39;ve got an open bathroom policy in our house, but I also communicate my feelings about privacy with them too, if guests are over I obviously don&#39;t want the door open although the kids can be in there with me.

I wouldn&#39;t want to change any of those memories. And<br/>\nnow I have a real snuggle button of a boy. I think that&#39;s a direct result of<br/>\nme *not* listening to well meant advice to put the baby down, for pity&#39;s<br/>\nsake.

That makes a<br/>\ngreat deal of difference to your availability. Might it be possible for your<br/>\ndaughter to have something to do right there beside you? It used to be the<br/>\nnorm that children were always with their parents and it&#39;s only a recent<br/>\nphenomenon that children have been separated from their parents during work<br/>\nhours.

Instead of trying to change my son&#39;s needs (to be with me pretty much all the time), I changed mine. For that period of time, it was more important that he feel safe and that I was accessible than it was for me to have privacy in the bathroom.

Ask her if she&#39;ll bring a book for you to look at together, or ask her to tell you a story. Ask if she wants to take a bath and maybe she&#39;ll be comfortable letting you pull the shower curtain partway closed while you&#39;re on the toilet. Ask if she wants to set up some stuffed animals or dolls (or whatever) on the sink or the side of the bathtub.

What I have to offer is that <br/>\nI know a young man who was like this and his parents did just what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing, figured out ways to accommodate his needs. This included <br/>\nleaving the bathroom door open, too. She&#39;s only 6 - at that age my kids <br/>\njust came in and out all the time when we parents were in the bathroom. <br/>\nWe&#39;re still not very modest about that kind of thing in our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - this kid is an awesome young man of 20 years old now, and has <br/>\nno problem being by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis fear or need lasted a long time though. It eased up and he was <br/>\neventually able to be in other parts of the house from his parents, but <br/>\nhe was pretty old before he was willing to be left home alone - past the <br/>\nage that most kids are fine with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccept it and work around it. You wouldn&#39;t be resentful if she was <br/>\nblind, right? Treat this the same way - it is how she is, she isn&#39;t <br/>\nchoosing to be this way, it is a real need. She&#39;s old enough that you <br/>\ncan talk about it a bit, with her, I&#39;m sure. Not in a resentful way. Not <br/>\nin a way that makes her feel bad about it. I&#39;m thinking of it more as <br/>\naceepting her need and assuming you&#39;re going to accommodate it, but you <br/>\nhave the problem of wanting to tidy up or fix some food, etc., and her <br/>\nnot wanting you to leave her for a second. Ask if she has any ideas how <br/>\nto make that work. You offer some, too (she could go with you and help <br/>\nout, she could go with you and play nearby, she could be in another room <br/>\nbut where she has a direct line of sight to you. Maybe she could have a <br/>\nbell to ring if she wants you. Who knows? Come up with lots of ideas and <br/>\ndecide to try out some or all of them. Make it sort of a joint <br/>\nexploration of what will work and what won&#39;t. You could even have some <br/>\nfun with it. How about tying a piece of elastic on your ankle and the <br/>\nother end on hers. How about setting up a videocam at the kitchen sink <br/>\nso she can see you while you&#39;re doing dishes. Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t worry about her being okay. She won&#39;t be like this when she&#39;s <br/>\n25 years old.
