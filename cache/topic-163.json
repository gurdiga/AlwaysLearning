She is in a little school this year.  She is actually our only child that has been in elementary school.  We unhomeschooled our five older children until they chose to go to school. My oldest never went to school and will be graduating from college in June, the second went (when she learned to read ) at ninth grade and in currently in college, our third has been playing professional hockey so he is just attending full time this year as a junior in high school, the other two went in this year as 7 and 9th grades.  I was also able to homeschool our 14yo foster daughter after she had her baby.  I was surprised at how supportive the state was about unschooling her and letting her be with her baby.  She is now 18 and in college also.  <br/>\nI learned about homeschooling in Canada in the late 80&#39;s.  We decided then that this was the life we wanted for our family.  I learned from &quot;Growing Without Schooling,&quot; John Holt and all of the wonderful authors from that magazine.  We loved it and living in the country provided endless opportunities for play, creativity and meaningful work.  We unexpectedly got pregnant with #7 last year.  He is seven months and I am starting to feel like my head is starting to float to the top. <br/>\nI hope to get motivated again by this group and also will be attending Life is Good in Vancouver, WA.  It will be strange for me to unschool a single child with a much younger sibling in tow.  I imagine it will be a totally new experience for me.  I am feeling a bit nervous because it seems like something we are doing rather than just who we are.  My continuum was broken by sending her to school and I am wondering how hard it will be to deschool her.  <br/>\nLooking forward to being here and participating.<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: a little rudeness (was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Intro)","postDate":"1210951079","msgId":34921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFMTg3MzNBLTM3MjAtNDQyOS04NjIyLTY1MEMzMzE4ODlCOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGcwajl2aitlN2QxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcwajl2aitlN2QxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34916,"nextInTopic":35030,"prevInTime":34920,"nextInTime":34922,"topicId":163,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Reminded me of Randy Cassingham s Get Out Of Hell Free cards: http://www.goohf.com/ Those are great!!

Food is way down on his priority list ... he <br/>\nhas been teaching me a lot about trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggie is into arts and crafts, is teaching herself to read by making <br/>\nart out of words, and loves singing and dancing and gymnastics.  She <br/>\nhas a closet full of dress up clothes and is right now letting me <br/>\nknow that this is taking too long -- she has been ready since <br/>\nyesterday to go to the local thrift store to find some more dress up <br/>\ntreasures.  She tends to be more emotionally sensitive ... she has <br/>\nbeen teaching me a lot about the power of language and the importance <br/>\nof validation.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is, I don&#39;t know how to describe him, he is just one of those <br/>\nkids that is generally happy and easy going, which isn&#39;t to say that <br/>\nhe isn&#39;t really good at expressing his emotions, letting his family <br/>\nmembers and friends know when they have made him mad or frustrated or <br/>\nhappy or sad.  He will tell you he is three, but clearly believes <br/>\nthat it means nothing since he is *obviously* the same age as his <br/>\nsiblings.

We have 5<br/>\ndaughters:  Hannah 16, Rachael 14, Abra 8, and Abby and BG 5.  Outside of<br/>\nHannah being in a private preschool and public kindergarten, they&#39;ve always<br/>\nbeen.  The two oldest have toyed with going to school but right now say they<br/>\nare content being home.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first started homeschooling, the only homeschoolers I knew were<br/>\npretty traditional (textbook), the most relaxed ones using unit studies.<br/>\nBut all I knew were very authoritative, rule oriented parents.  I never did<br/>\nquite fit in.  Early on I heard about unschoolers but everything I read<br/>\nseemed centered around academics, not parenting.  It seemed like part of the<br/>\nwhole picture missing something.  I came across radical unschooling on a<br/>\ntraditional homeschool message board where they were ripping it up one side<br/>\nand down the other.  I followed some links and found Sandra&#39;s site.  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhen the whole picture started coming together for me.  I&#39;ve been very<br/>\nchallenged at times.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling is radical.  For me it has required an open mind and a<br/>\nwillingness to throw out those things that I&#39;d accepted as truths.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ndiscussed radical unschooling with a few friends, and I see how hard it is<br/>\nfor people to get their minds around it.  Parents want to feel important and<br/>\nin control.  When I talk about letting go of controls and being a partner (I<br/>\nlove that idea) all they can see is that their role is diminished.  Well<br/>\nthen, what do they need parents for?  It&#39;s hard to get past that.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant that adversarial relationship with my children which I think is<br/>\nunadvoidable (from what I&#39;ve witnessed) in the traditional parent<br/>\n(authoritative/rule maker/enforcer) - children (obedient/submissive) type<br/>\nfamily.  As we&#39;ve let go of controls, our relationship with our children has<br/>\nblossomed.  I&#39;m not their adversary that they have to figure out a way to<br/>\nget around.  We work together, they come to me, I actually feel more<br/>\nimportant and needed than before when we had rules (and we never had a lot<br/>\nat that).  Our life is so much more joyful.  I like my children.  They are<br/>\nreally neat, unique people.  I like being around them.  And they certainly<br/>\nact like they like their dad and me.  I believe they do.  For me, that&#39;s<br/>\nbeen the best treasure of radical unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJanet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Intro","postDate":"1071294142","msgId":17534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4LjM5NDY1NjBhLjJkMGMwMGJlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17533,"nextInTopic":25184,"prevInTime":17533,"nextInTime":17535,"topicId":163,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/12/2003 3:27:17 PM Mountain Standard Time, sanfrancesco@cox.net writes: -=-How do you DO IT with the little kids that don t sit still and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1369937858\">In a message dated 12/12/2003 3:27:17 PM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sanfrancesco@...\">sanfrancesco@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-How do you DO IT with the little kids that don&#39;t sit still and <br/>\nbasically just want to bean eachother in the head all day with <br/>\nblocks????-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic, movies and comfort food.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started homeschooling Kirby was five so...

My <br/>\nname is Mary, I&#39;m 41, married and have 2 kids ages 7 and 12. I&#39;ve been <br/>\nlurking and reading your discussions for about a week now and I&#39;m LOVING it. <br/>\nThe math discussion has brought up ideas I haven&#39;t even begun to explore <br/>\nyet. I was always great at school math, but never great at connecting it to <br/>\nthe real world. I&#39;m sure all of your brilliant questions and ideas will be <br/>\npercolating in my brain for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;math as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the key to the universe.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if books by Steven Hawking might help with this?
