You could adhere to unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies/ child-led<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning/attachment style parenting or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever....but they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure I agree with this.  My daughter&#39;s neighbour was over when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; was visiting yesterday.  She was delighted to tell my daughter that her<br/>\n&gt; daughter was learning her alphabet.  This little girl, who is about 17<br/>\n&gt; months old is being taught to repeat the letters after her mother.  She<br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t got a clue what it all means, but her mother thinks she&#39;s learning<br/>\n&gt; her alphabet.  My grandson, at just about 16 months, isn&#39;t the least bit<br/>\n&gt; interested in the alphabet, though he&#39;s crazy about books.  If he asked<br/>\n&gt; Heather what the letters were, she&#39;d happily tell him.  Otherwise, it just<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t an issue.  Now I know that lots of people who end up sending their<br/>\n&gt; kids to school would have the same attitude when their kids are that<br/>\n&gt; little, but isn&#39;t my daughter unschooling Kaelin?  Does it make a<br/>\n&gt; difference that she&#39;s also unschooling Skye, age 7?   I&#39;ve always told<br/>\n&gt; people who were worried that they wouldn&#39;t be able to do a good job of<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling that they&#39;ve been doing it since their child was born.  I<br/>\n&gt; think that if they&#39;ve also been letting their child make any educational<br/>\n&gt; decisions during those &quot;preschool&quot; years, then they&#39;ve been unschooling<br/>\n&gt; since birth.  Obviously they aren&#39;t experienced unschoolers in the sense<br/>\n&gt; that people with older kids are, but I don&#39;t agree that they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I did not say it was all equal.  My point was, and is,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and seems to have been missed and equated to mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other things, that experience does not equal wisdom.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That youngness does not equal niaveness.  That<br/>\n&gt; &gt;prejudging based on those things can cause a person to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;miss out on something important the person they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;judging has to offer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to agree with this.
