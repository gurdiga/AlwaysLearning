I  <br/>\nnever meant to insult anyone there and apologized repeatedly to no  <br/>\nresponse. I think it was assumed I would be one more hurt and  <br/>\noffended woman on her list that would fade quietly into the background.<br/>\n<br/>\n* My posts were certainly edited and I was scolded. Moreover, after  <br/>\nthings were clearly going downhill in that discussion on the list (I  <br/>\nwas feeling misunderstood and saddened others felt hurt by my words),  <br/>\nI shifted to private communication in an effort to clear things up.  <br/>\nThis was very unsuccessful. But there are several emails in that  <br/>\nstrain of the conversation that are invisible to anyone reading on  <br/>\nthe list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am primarily disturbed by Sandra&#39;s attitude that &quot;it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmatter&quot;. She has offended several people who have tried different  <br/>\nlevels of clearing communication for the benefit of good dialog. But  <br/>\nthis underscores my repeated experience with her that some people  <br/>\njust don&#39;t matter. It is an attitude that is completely discordant  <br/>\nwith mindfulness and the human respect unschooling is supposed to be  <br/>\nin support of. If her credibility and consistency does not matter to  <br/>\nher, what good is anything she has to say?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I&#39;m moving on from this discussion on this website.

I put a &quot;no solicitors&quot; note on the  <br/>\ndoor yesterday.  The Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses knocked anyway.   Then my  <br/>\nphone rang and someone hung up.
