The decide within a family structure,<br/>\nthough, so it isn&#39;t like they never have other people&#39;s interests, demands,<br/>\nneeds to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they get older, they often choose to put themselves into circumstances<br/>\nthat involve commitments to other people&#39;s schedules and requirements,<br/>\nthough. Their own interests usually lead to involvement with organizations,<br/>\nclasses, groups of people, businesses, etc. What I&#39;ve observed is that they<br/>\nare excellent at keeping to schedules, appointments, agendas, regulations<br/>\nand rules.

I do believe this<br/>\nis because they haven&#39;t been put into a position of learning to shirk -<br/>\nsomething schools manage to teach quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they decide to take a job, they decide carefully - they think ahead<br/>\nabout what they are committing to do. One of my daughters who is a night<br/>\nowl, normally, took a job this past few months that requires her to get up<br/>\naround 5:30 am and catch a bus at 6:30 to be at work by 7:30 am. She really<br/>\nthought about that schedule and what impact it would have on her usual way<br/>\nof life. She decided she would do it and she has not missed a single day or<br/>\nbeen late a single day since she started the job three months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who are used to making smaller decisions (what to eat, when to go to<br/>\nbed, what to read, what to spend their time on) get used to thinking before<br/>\nacting - they get used to considering the possible options before<br/>\ncommitting to one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three unschooled kids all now in their 20s. They&#39;ve all had jobs and<br/>\nbeen valued employees.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also say, though, that it is very possible that unschooled kids will<br/>\nchoose their work more consciously than other kids, too, and they&#39;ll think<br/>\nabout the kind of work schedule it will entail. My daughters have very<br/>\nconsciously thought about this kind of thing and most definitely are not<br/>\nwanting 8 to 5 jobs sitting in an office while their own children are off<br/>\nat daycare, so that entered strongly into career choices for them. They<br/>\nwant flexibility of scheduling and they want part-time options, too. So<br/>\nthey&#39;re planning ahead for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very interesting observation is also that these grown-up unschooled kids<br/>\nturn out almost always to be rule followers and extremely reliable. At the<br/>\nbeginning of our unschooling journey I thought this might happen (for<br/>\nvarious reasons) - but now I&#39;ve seen it and not just for my own kids, but<br/>\nall of their unschooled friends, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think that years of forced practice at following schedules<br/>\nimposed by other people (schools or by parents) is what makes so many<br/>\nadults irresponsible and unreliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoercion causes people to become apathetic or resistant. Neither of those<br/>\nbodes well for someone being a reliable employee holding down a 40-hour<br/>\nworkweek job.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] working after unschooling","postDate":"1354892708","msgId":69749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTkwMWNkZDQ4YyQzZmE0ODkzMCRiZWVkOWI5MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69747,"nextInTopic":69752,"prevInTime":69748,"nextInTime":69750,"topicId":69738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****how does unschooling prepare kids for the 40-hour work week (assuming many will have jobs that look like that)**** I think there are people who are really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1852263154\">****how does unschooling prepare kids for the 40-hour work week (assuming<br/>\nmany will have jobs that look like that)****<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are people who are really good at following exact schedules,<br/>\nbeing on time, staying somewhere til the clock says they can leave, taking<br/>\nResponsibility seriously, keeping commitments, and following through on what<br/>\nthey say they&#39;ll do.  Those people often make excellent, reliable employees<br/>\nof corporations or other businesses.  Many of these people have been to<br/>\nschool, because school is where the majority of children (statistically<br/>\nspeaking) in the US, Europe, and many other places spend their childhoods.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut school doesn&#39;t create people who can follow schedules and be on time and<br/>\ndo what they&#39;re told and learn what they&#39;re told and when.  School rewards<br/>\npeople who can do these things - whose internal rhythms are set up this way<br/>\nand whose preferences lean this way - and it encourages these behaviors, and<br/>\ndiscourages the opposite.  Kids who do what Schools require are rewarded<br/>\nwith good grades and praise and special jobs (like Hall Monitor).  School<br/>\ntells these kids they will have great jobs one day - that they will be able<br/>\nto Do Anything They Want if they keep their grades up and behave well and<br/>\nfollow along with what they&#39;re asked to do.  Lots of parents in turn believe<br/>\nthat what this means is that school is Making their children into Future<br/>\nWonderful Workers.  But the school isn&#39;t doing the Making - there are so<br/>\nvery many people who go through school without coming out as Good Workers at<br/>\ngraduation :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLook at all the people who, because of their personality or interests etc.<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to (or can&#39;t) hold a Traditional job with Traditional hours - and<br/>\nwho have been to the same schools as the Good Workers :-)   People who own<br/>\ntheir own businesses or who follow their dreams of being artists or actors<br/>\nor such.  People who spend their lives traveling, or volunteering rather<br/>\nthan working.  People who decide they&#39;d rather stay at home with their kids<br/>\nthan Work a Regular job.  People who literally can&#39;t hold a job and need to<br/>\nrely on public assistance or charity to get by.  People who work part-time,<br/>\nflex-time, or other Non-Traditional schedules.  For example, people who flex<br/>\ntheir time among shifts working anywhere within the 24-hour day in a given<br/>\nweek depending on the needs of their employer (my husband had a job like<br/>\nthat for a while, where he was a manager who was expected to show up any<br/>\ngiven day on whatever shift he felt needed him most).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways to Make a Living - or to simply Live - that barely touch<br/>\non the world Schools envision of clocks and bells and lunch hours and<br/>\nstagnant, precise schedules.   I personally work part-time from home, don&#39;t<br/>\npunch a clock, work when I need to (day or night) during the week to meet my<br/>\ndeadlines, and rarely if ever need to set an alarm clock and rise before the<br/>\nsun does like I did in order to get to school on time :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd re the original question - unschooling, in my mind, doesn&#39;t prepare kids<br/>\nfor the 40 hour week any more than school does.  What unschooling does is<br/>\nlet kids Live - now - today - in a happy, fun way full of learning and joy<br/>\nand peace and wonder.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t only reward kids who will fit<br/>\ninto the corporate world - doesn&#39;t tell kids the only way their lives will<br/>\nCount is if they have good jobs and make good money and get promotions and<br/>\nthen use their money to Buy Things :-)  Unschooling is about looking at who<br/>\nyour kids are Now - Today - and helping them explore and enjoy in a world<br/>\nthat is full of possibilities -not a world that is pointed one-way toward<br/>\nthe corporate entrance doors.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: working after unschooling","postDate":"1354887022","msgId":69747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1Mzc5QzhBLTEzQ0QtNDcxRi04REJBLTBDQkY2NzFDRTAyN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs5c3EzMStzdWI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs5c3EzMStzdWI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69745,"nextInTopic":69749,"prevInTime":69746,"nextInTime":69748,"topicId":69738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-There was never an age limit on him living here, and there s no expectation that he get it all together and move out by a particular deadline.

We have neighbors who know they can call him for odd jobs and know he&#39;s trustworthy. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also knows about living as a professional craftsperson - something he hopes to do, himself, has done to a small extent.

That&#39;s a great luxury, one a lot of his friends don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] working after unschooling","postDate":"1354862917","msgId":69743,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTQ4NjI5MTcuMTIzNDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69742,"nextInTopic":69745,"prevInTime":69742,"nextInTime":69744,"topicId":69738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***how does unschooling prepare kids for the 40-hour work week (assuming many will have jobs that look like that).*** A couple of nights ago I took a young","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165316513\">***how does unschooling prepare kids for the 40-hour work week (assuming many will have jobs that look like that).***<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of nights ago I took a young adult to the ER at 2 am.  He&#39;s staying at our house for a couple of months.  He has diabetes and he accidentally took the wrong insulin and couldn&#39;t get his blood sugar to stop dropping, so we took him in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ER was peaceful at that hour.  I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t always that way but it was that night.  At 2 am there were many people up and working and enjoying their jobs.  There were front desk staff and nurses and doctors and janitors and security guards and police officers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was sitting there waiting, trying not to fall asleep, I thought about what it would be like to work there in that moment.  The two women at the front desk were happily chatting and working and based on the location of their desk, they could watch the sun rise every morning through a magnificent huge window.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux, 11 yrs old, was with us because she was worried about our friend.  We were there until 6 am.  For four hrs, she stayed awake and watched and waited.  She could have a job with unconventional hrs for sure.  Maybe some of those people working had regular 40 hr weeks, maybe some of them didn&#39;t.  Maybe some of them never wanted to work nights and ended up there anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I know for sure is that either of my kids could have a job at whatever hour of the day and settle in just fine as long as they liked the work.   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] working after unschooling","postDate":"1354839483","msgId":69742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2OUNDRDMxLTdDQUUtNDE4OC05MkNFLTVDMjVCMzlERDgzOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs5cjc5Mis5dnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69741,"nextInTopic":69743,"prevInTime":69741,"nextInTime":69743,"topicId":69738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah....

They invited him to work there. :-) He accepted.  They paid for him to move to Austin; if he didn&#39;t last six months, he would have owed some of the moving money.  He&#39;s been there five and a half years.  But each day is a choice.  He knows he can quit when he&#39;s done.  He was relieved not to have lost his job when they had a big layoff last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have a friend, who&#39;s about Kirby&#39;s age.  He went to school.  He didn&#39;t go to college.<br/>\nA few years ago he was very happy that he had applied for a job at T-Mobile and gotten it!  He was giddy, when he found out he had the job.   A few days later, before he had gone in for training, but knew the job was his, he was at a party here and was posing/posturing about what a drag it was to be working for a corporation.   I was not the least bit embarrassed to say &quot;You APPLIED for that job.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t drafted, or snatched by a press gang.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he goes to work, he gets paid.<br/>\nIf he goes to work happily, he helps other people be happy.<br/>\nIf he goes to work and does well, he&#39;s praised and rewarded for that.

How has Kirby (for example) done with the fact that the large corporation owns his time week after week? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this question.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;m going to quote something from an interview online.   Then I&#39;m going to come back with a philosophical answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nReader Questions (RQ):<br/>\n<br/>\nRQ 1: My question about this approach is how children would learn when they have to be in a situation that is structured. Unfortunately, those situations do pop up in life (particularly in higher education or training for future careers). Part of the educational process, to some extent, is learning to cope with different environments in which learning must occur. I love the ideas of letting a child explore his or her passions and think this applies regardless of a child being educated in a homeschool setting or in a school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: It doesn�t take ten years of practice for a kid to learn how to show up on time, and if they�re interested in doing something, they�ll probably get up early! All my children and very many more I�ve known have excelled in structured situations because they were there by choice and they weren�t sick to death of structure. They thought it was fun, when it was their option to be there or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty attended a weeklong Jr. Police Academy when he was 14, the sergeant fell over homeself at the awards dinner, telling me how disciplined Marty was and how attentive and cooperative. �You can always tell a kid who comes from a family with a lot of discipline and rules,�  he said. What he was seeing was a kid who really wanted to be there, who was interested in learning. School claims that it�s important for kids to learn to follow a schedule, but it takes no learning at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool defenders claim that unschooled kids won�t know how to stand in a line. Anyone who�s ever gone to a movie knows how to follow a schedule and queue up. :=)  It�s another thing that doesn�t take years of practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother claim is that if kids don�t live with strictly scheduled days, with early bedtimes and early wake-up calls, they will never be able to hold a job. My kids owned their own alarm clocks early on, and it took them about fifteen seconds to learn to use them. My oldest has been working since he was 14, and the other two since mid-teens, too. The three of them have 22 years of work experience among them. Currently, Marty works at 4:00 or 4:30 a.m. (depending on the day), and Kirby works from 8:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. four nights a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding those to the collection of the shift starting-times of the jobs my kids have worked shows a range that would easily suggest that a child who grew up with an early bedtime and a wake-up call would be quite handicapped holding a job, while my kids with their flexible lives based on the requirements of the situation have done very well:<br/>\n<br/>\nAM:<br/>\n4:00 (or 4:30 some days)<br/>\n6:30 (Marty, for 16 months when he was 16/17)<br/>\n8:00<br/>\n9:00<br/>\n10:00 (Holly at a flower shop)<br/>\n11:00<br/>\n<br/>\nPM:<br/>\n1:00<br/>\n3:00<br/>\n4:30<br/>\n5:00<br/>\n6:00<br/>\n8:30 (to 7:30 a.m.)<br/>\n11:00 (to 8:00 a.m.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that �discipline� about studying or waking and sleeping is necessary is another of many school-based myths accepted as fact.  Unschoolers have done very well in jobs, colleges and universities. Here are some accounts of teens� jobs.
