I&#39;m used to it, so it doesn&#39;t bother me anywhere nearly as much as other people asking me about it: do you have a cold? need a sweater? that&#39;s quite a cough, you should try... blah blah blah blah. So I do recommend stepping back from fussing over the cough if it seems to be something like that. You could leave out cough-drops or stock up on tea - throat soothing things are helpful with post nasal drip, sometimes, but don&#39;t push them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes to try new foods, you could look into adding &quot;warming spices&quot; to your cooking or getting some candied ginger.

In talking further, the feeling-sad thoughts tend to happen when he&#39;s gone too long without eating, or he&#39;s overly tired or not feeling well, or when something upsetting has happened with a game, etc. -- external forces. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes he&#39;ll be frustrated with himself and call himself &quot;stupid&quot; and say he doesn&#39;t deserve ____. What seems to help in those instances is for me to say, &quot;So if ________ [one of his friends or cousins] did that, you&#39;d think they don&#39;t deserve ______?&quot; -- that really seems to help shift his perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has high expectations of himself, and that&#39;s something we talk about when he feels he&#39;s done something stupid or isn&#39;t deserving of something. We talk about him cutting himself slack, just as he would a friend. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===I&#39;ll ask why and she&#39;ll say, &quot;I don&#39;t deserve all that.&quot;===<br/>\n<br/>\nIn those type situations, I&#39;ll tend to reply with, &quot;Well I think you do!!&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that particular situation (&quot;one friend and one cupcake with one candle&quot;), I might say something like, &quot;No, ALL your friends and one HUGE cupcake COVERED with candles!!!&quot;. In a playful & happy, but sincere, tone of voice, rather than an &quot;awwwww, I&#39;m sorry&quot; voice. Because a playful & happy voice is what helps ME smile and cheer up a bit and shake off the &quot;I don&#39;t deserve&quot;-itis . . . whereas an &quot;awwww, I&#39;m sorry&quot; voice makes me feel more blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===My daughter, Emma (8), seems to have pretty low self-esteem.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked my son what helps boost his self-esteem, and he said being good at his favorite things definitely helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s surpassed me at all sorts of computer stuff, and I make a point of letting him know that. I don&#39;t remember, at age 12, an adult EVER telling me I was better at something than they! <br/>\n<br/>\nSince he isn&#39;t in a setting where he&#39;s being compared with other people, he&#39;s not always aware just how much cool stuff he does and knows. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one time he was figuring out, in the context of his everyday life, something that was translated in my head as an addition or subtraction problem, but he obviously wasn&#39;t arriving at an answer the way I&#39;d been taught to get to it in school. So I asked him how he got to his answer and when he explained it to me, I told him that was really neat how he&#39;d figured that out without someone saying, &quot;This is how you do that&quot;. And as he&#39;s gotten older and way quicker at doing math in his head than I, I let him know that very thing - that he&#39;s quicker at doing that in his head than I am! (and I was an &quot;A&quot; math student, but I need pencil + paper to arrive at my answers). <br/>\n<br/>\nI ask for his feedback on things (like I did for this topic, for example). If I&#39;m struggling with something he knows how to do, I ask for his help. These were not things adults did when I was my son&#39;s age, but I do them because I appreciate and respect his input.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis friends ask for his help doing things. He thinks highly of his friends, and it certainly boosts his self-esteem when they ask him to help out with something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he&#39;s feeling blue and undeserving, I remind him of all those things. I know for my own self that it can be hard, in the midst of feeling blue, to feel valuable and confident, and that it can help to be reminded that you are valuable and to be reminded of the things you do well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===With her looks, she is regularly asking me if I think she has a double chin and if I think her face is fat.  She has lovely cheeks and almost everyone in my family has a bit of a double chin.  I tend to talk around the subject instead of answering her, but I don&#39;t want to dismiss her concerns.===<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could look at pictures of her female ancestors, aunts, female cousins, and you, all at varying ages, (especially pictures of those whom she loves dearly), to see which features are similar to hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could ask her favorite family members and friends to tell which of her features they love, and why. I remember in high school being self-conscious about my short, muscular legs -- until I moved to a new school and in gym class a guy commented on how strong and muscular my legs were. From that day forward (and even now, with my legs having their share of flab!), I&#39;ve thought of my legs as being strong. Last year one of my sisters-in-law commented on how smooth my facial skin is, and that helped me look at it in a whole new light. Having input from other people can be eye-opening!<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk her which of your features she likes. If she has those same features, you could point that out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love looking at people&#39;s eyes, so I tend to talk about the different colors / flecks of colors in their eyes, rather than a generic, &quot;You have pretty eyes.&quot; I remember my parents telling me I was pretty, but it was generic, never specific. I was in 10th grade before I remember someone giving me a compliment about a specific feature (my boyfriend&#39;s mom told me the day my boyfriend first met me he went home and told her he&#39;d met a girl with the most beautiful big brown eyes -- no wonder I have a thing about eyes LOL). When I talk to my son about his physical features, I talk about individual features and what I like about them -- I hope that by doing so, when he looks in the mirror, he will notice those specific things and think of them in a positive way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Keeping Warm","postDate":"1305356358","msgId":61181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNzU2MC42NTk2MS5xbUB3ZWI4NzMxMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxQjExMTAzQjg1ODRBM0RBMzhFMUM3RURFMTIyNThBQFRhbWFyYT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxamVrMCs1MTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjFCMTExMDNCODU4NEEzREEzOEUxQzdFREUxMjI1OEFAVGFtYXJhPg=="},"prevInTopic":61180,"nextInTopic":61188,"prevInTime":61180,"nextInTime":61182,"topicId":61156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Could it be allergies?

The cold is unlikely to be as much of a factor than other things. It <br/>\nmay just be that you are linking the two because you are aware of the cold. It&#39;s <br/>\neasy to correlate something you don&#39;t like with something else you don&#39;t like if <br/>\nthey seem to coincide in time.

Cuddling up and reading a book all warm and snuggly <br/>\nunder a blanket or watching a movie. Racing around the house like a maniac, <br/>\nwrestling, jumping on the trampoline, dancing, a moving and a shaking, all of <br/>\nthose things get you warmer. Feeding her more will keep her warmer.

I was looking forward to NOT battling this year, and letting her <br/>\nwear what she wanted and letting her decide on her own when she was cold, <br/>\nbut with the cold weather has come a sniffle and a cough that is obviously <br/>\nbothering her.  Perhaps not as much as it&#39;s bothering me, but last night she <br/>\nhad trouble sleeping because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s not sick, this seems to be totally bought on by the colder weather. <br/>\nShe&#39;s fine during the day (when it&#39;s warmer), but as the evening comes on <br/>\nand it starts to get cold, she starts coughing.  Yet she still won&#39;t put on <br/>\nwarm clothes, and despite my resolve not to say anything, I&#39;ve started <br/>\nasking her to put on something warmer, and we&#39;ve started fighting about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to do this.  I want to be able to let her do what she wants, <br/>\nand I suspect that part of her reason of not wanting to wear warm clothes is <br/>\nbecause I want her to, so obviously what I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t helping.  I know I <br/>\nreally need to change my thinking on this, and find better ways to deal with <br/>\nit.  We do have lap sized rugs around the house, on the couch to snuggle in, <br/>\nand these work better for her than clothes.  I probably need to put the <br/>\nheater on more as well, but we&#39;re still reeling from the huge bill from <br/>\nhaving the air conditioning on over summer, so I find myself hesitating over <br/>\nit, when I guess I really need to just do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love any suggestions on what I can do to help her.  Do I need to just <br/>\nstep back and let her regulate it, despite the cough?  Keep looking for more <br/>\nways to help her stay warm without warm clothes?

My daughter is an artist, and she is very particular about  her work, sometimes very critical.  She&#39;ll destroy drawings that she isn&#39;t satisfied with, and for a time, I would try to point out things that I liked about the ones she wasn&#39;t happy with, but quickly came to see that to her, that added insult to injury--not only was her drawing not up to her own standards, but mom was questioning, or somehow pushing aside those standards too, saying that her judgment was wrong. It has been far more helpful for me to listen to her list off the imperfections without interjecting my own positive comments--which can come later.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve learned to keep quite about certain things, and to also talk about my own mistakes and learning process in a way that is less direct.

My daughter is an artist, and she is very particular about  her work, sometimes very critical.  She&#39;ll destroy drawings that she isn&#39;t satisfied with, and for a time, I would try to point out things that I liked about the ones she wasn&#39;t happy with, but quickly came to see that to her, that added insult to injury--not only was her drawing not up to her own standards, but mom was questioning, or somehow pushing aside those standards too, saying that her judgment was wrong. It has been far more helpful for me to listen to her list off the imperfections without interjecting my own positive comments--which can come later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned to keep quite about certain things, and to also talk about my own mistakes and learning process in a way that is less direct. I also bring to her attention other artist&#39;s processes and stories about mistakes and imperfection.

It may be useful for her to see that the girls she sees on TV, or in magazines, whom she may be comparing herself to, likely don&#39;t look the same in &quot;real&quot; life: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://demo.fb.se/e/girlpower/retouch/\">http://demo.fb.se/e/girlpower/retouch/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient, it takes a long time to load.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I&#39;d try to show it to her in an off-handed way, as in &quot;wow, look what I just found; this is cool,&quot; rather than relating it directly to her own self-criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Self Esteem","postDate":"1305302590","msgId":61162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5MzE4OC41MDgxNC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlxamVrMCs1MTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlxamVrMCs1MTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61161,"nextInTopic":61163,"prevInTime":61161,"nextInTime":61163,"topicId":61156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you complain about you looks or you body in front of her?

She is worried about her looks and says she doesn&#39;t deserve nice things.  I can&#39;t figure out where these thoughts are coming from, and I don&#39;t know what to say to her.<br/>\nA couple of examples:  I had a surprise party for her birthday this year.  She&#39;ll say &quot;I want a surprise party next year!&quot;  Then quickly change to, &quot;No, I just want one friend and a cupcake with one candle.&quot;  I&#39;ll ask why and she&#39;ll say, &quot;I don&#39;t deserve all that.&quot;<br/>\nAlso, I picked a daffodil for her one day and she sneaked out and threw it in the street.  I asked why, and she said she didn&#39;t deserve it.  It&#39;s breaking my heart.  <br/>\nWith her looks, she is regularly asking me if I think she has a double chin and if I think her face is fat.  She has lovely cheeks and almost everyone in my family has a bit of a double chin.  I tend to talk around the subject instead of answering her, but I don&#39;t want to dismiss her concerns.<br/>\nI worry because I was so depressed as a child and teen.
