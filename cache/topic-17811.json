My grandfather had been dead 20 years before my Mom realized she was still angry with him for dying.  I believe the youngest sister is still angry at him for that  -- she  almost never speaks of him, and has huge trust issues, alonf with a genuine deep-seated scorn for men.  The only memory I&#39;ve heard her share is of the day he died, and how angry her Mom was that he was dead.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
