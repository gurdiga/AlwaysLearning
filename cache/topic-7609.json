The law here states that a person must be at least 14 <br/>\nyears <br/>\nof age to apply for the permit. You study certain books that cover <br/>\nHawks and <br/>\nFalcons, medications and diseases, equipment, state law etc..... and <br/>\ntake a <br/>\ntest with the local Fish and game person.  That makes you licensed to <br/>\nown one <br/>\nbird, I believe only two different species as your choices. Very <br/>\nlimited. <br/>\nAlso, you need a master falconer that agrees to sponsor you, which I <br/>\nnow have.<br/>\nSide note: the guy I found to be my sponsor (found him online) just <br/>\nhappens <br/>\nto be from the same town I am, and we were in HS at the same time!! <br/>\nToo <br/>\nbizarre when you figure the odds of two Fairbanksans being in <br/>\nPensacola! And <br/>\na strange hobby to boot....<br/>\nAnyway, Your sponsor does all the hands on training. They teach you <br/>\nhow to <br/>\nmake your own equipment (saves a LOT of money) like the jesses <br/>\n(teathers on <br/>\nthe ankles) and what not.  They make sure you know how to trap and <br/>\nhandle the <br/>\nbird, train it properly (a daily affair) build correct facilities for <br/>\nit, <br/>\nmedicate it etc....<br/>\nThere is a lot to learn.<br/>\nAfter two years of owning a bird and being apprenticed, you are <br/>\nconsidered a <br/>\n&quot;general falconer&quot;. Five more years and you earn the title of &quot;master <br/>\nfalconer&quot;.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a sport that takes a lot of patience as the bird needs daily <br/>\nattention <br/>\nand training. <br/>\nDuring hunting season you are out in the field 3-4 times a week for 2-<br/>\n3 hours.<br/>\nThe bird brings the kill to you and you have to prepare it. A lot of <br/>\nit gets <br/>\nfrozen for feeding the bird later, but most people eat what the bird <br/>\ncatches <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nYou have to either raise or buy quail to feed your bird in addition <br/>\nto the <br/>\nhunting. This is not a sport for people that can&#39;t be home a lot!!<br/>\nThe cost is prohibitive unless your a do-it-your-selfer. Even then, <br/>\nyou have <br/>\nto consider the fact that without telemetry (radio transmitters) you <br/>\nmay lose <br/>\na bird. Not a good idea.<br/>\nSometimes they get blown just far enough away that they can&#39;t find <br/>\ntheir way <br/>\nback to you. After all the weeks and weeks spent trapping and <br/>\ntraining a good <br/>\nbird, you don&#39;t want to lose them!!<br/>\nMy sponsor offered to let me use his receiver if I just buy the <br/>\ntransmitter <br/>\nto start with.<br/>\nThe first bird I plan to trap is a red-tailed hawk. The facility I <br/>\nhave to <br/>\nbuild is an 8x8x8 cube basically.  There are specific requirements <br/>\nfor the <br/>\nsize depending on what type of bird you have.  The perches, walls, <br/>\nwindows <br/>\netc... all have specifications in order to keep the bird from hurting <br/>\nitself, <br/>\nkeep proper airflow and protection from wind, heat etc...<br/>\nYou need to make lures, jesses, hoods, tethers, special perches for <br/>\ntraining <br/>\n(like a ring perch), there is so much to do!! Oh, and I need to buy a <br/>\nchest <br/>\nfreezer for the kill....I&#39;d hate to have frozen rabbits in my regular <br/>\nfreezer, ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a year is more realistic....my sponsor thinks I can do it <br/>\nsooner.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see.<br/>\nJust having the permit will make me happy.<br/>\nIf anyone wants links or recommended reading, just email me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7548,"nextTopicId":7610}}
