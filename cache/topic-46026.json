Unschooled kids will look at that process and<br/>\ndecide wether or not they really need to do steps 2-59 to get to 60,<br/>\nwhile kids who have been schooled won&#39;t necessarily question that. <br/>\nSchools tend to belabor processes that could be so much simpler and take<br/>\nso much less time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who question things and don&#39;t like jumping through hoops, the ones<br/>\nwho often get in trouble in school, are really the smart ones!  They<br/>\nknow inside themselves that what is being said to them isn&#39;t truth and<br/>\nthey can&#39;t do much much about it.  So they either sacrifice themselves<br/>\nto get along in that system, or they don&#39;t and the system fails them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about other people, but I was one of the ones that<br/>\nsacrificed myself to get along.  I&#39;m soooooo eternally grateful that I<br/>\ncan give my own kids a better life!  I love that they are able to find<br/>\ntheir own ways to do things.
