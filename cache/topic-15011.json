Its<br/>\nnot difficult at all, you just need a few special pieces of equipment..then<br/>\npatience, and lots of stirring , watching the temperature, then waiting<br/>\naround for the curds to form and then hanging it in cheesecloth to drip. I<br/>\nlove mixing Chevre with fresh herbs from my garden. I made Garlic and Chives<br/>\nlast week..yummy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in the country as we do..makes unschooling so easy I think..we have a<br/>\npond, fields, woods nearby, a creek too..the girls are always bringing home<br/>\nfrogs, tadpoles, minnows and other creepy crawlies to observe. They help me<br/>\nbirth baby goats.. they have the horses to ride and care for..and each<br/>\nplanted their own garden spot this year..we all stay very busy.<br/>\nWe recently built a chicken house as a family project..talk about real life<br/>\nmath..and fun too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping my oldest doesn&#39;t rush the Grandma thing for me.. BG... but she<br/>\nand her boyfriend are in a serious relationship. I really wish she would<br/>\nhave chosen college/tech school or travel instead..but that&#39;s how it goes I<br/>\nguess.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s so cool that you plan to unschool your Grandchildren!<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to getting to know you.<br/>\nJulie in MO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: Hello and Into..<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oooo cheese making. how cool I would like to learn to<br/>\n&gt; make cheese so that me and my son Levi, who is 13<br/>\n&gt; could do that together. I&#39;ve just started the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling for Levi,but I love it! I used to just<br/>\n&gt; duplicate school in my home ( I thought that was what<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling was) But now we play Yahtzee and make<br/>\n&gt; alot of trips to the creek to play and explore<br/>\n&gt; things.I&#39;m a single mom. My other two childern are<br/>\n&gt; grown and I&#39;m already a grandma. I love it though. My<br/>\n&gt; grand kids are 2 & 3 I&#39;ll be homeschooling them also .<br/>\n&gt; My daughter and I never want them to have to go to<br/>\n&gt; public school. So nice to hear from you, Julie I hope<br/>\n&gt; we can share Ideas with both of us having 13 yr.<br/>\n&gt; olds;) Laurie </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15049,"nextTopicId":15058}}
