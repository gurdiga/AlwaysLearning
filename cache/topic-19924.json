I&#39;ve read a few of <br/>\nthem.....I&#39;d like to respond to something in your 1st msg....<br/>\nI&#39;m Jane ....<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that it is very very difficult to watch someone struggle with <br/>\ndepression.  It can be consuming.  The other person&#39;s happiness becomes a priority.  <br/>\nSometimes there is a tendency to be &#39;overhappy&#39; in hopes that it will spread to <br/>\nthe depressed person.   It then can be frustrating if the other person <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t respond.  There can be a whole dynamic around a family member&#39;s depression <br/>\nand everyone else&#39;s responses.    Your family has a history of depression and <br/>\nprobably co-depression or co-dependency - (that&#39;s an assumption based on your <br/>\nand your mother&#39;s experiences with depression.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: your message, I want to point out that choosing to &quot;let her live here&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;helping her become whole again&quot; are very separate and independent notions.  <br/>\nYou can do one without the other.  (Actually, I don&#39;t know if you can do the <br/>\nlatter one) You can also have requirements for her living with you.  You can <br/>\nhave boundaries for your own involvement in her emotional wellbeing...  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some possibilities that come to my mind....<br/>\n# &quot;Mom, I love you so much and I truly am glad for the opportunity for you to <br/>\nlive with us and be around your grandchild.  However, I have struggled with <br/>\ndepression in the way you are now and I need to keep my distance from that in <br/>\norder not to be sucked down that road again.  I want to be supportive but <br/>\nultimately you are responsible for your own healing.  What ideas do you have for <br/>\nmoving in that direction?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n# You can talk to your daughter about depression and about possible responses <br/>\nwhen grandma (or anyone!) &#39;overhelps&#39;.... <br/>\n<br/>\n# Because her depression is having an impact on your family, you can make <br/>\nother choices.  You can continue hosting her in the house.  You can require her <br/>\nsee a doctor/therapist/massage therapist/etc.  You can help her move out so <br/>\nthat you can be supportive without sacrificing your own sanity.  You can see a <br/>\ntherapist to help you.<br/>\n<br/>\n#&quot;Mom, I know life has been hard for you and that you&#39;re so sad.  I&#39;m so <br/>\nsorry for that.  I love you so very much and want you to be well.  I&#39;m glad for <br/>\nyou to live here so that I know that you&#39;re getting healthy food and that you&#39;re <br/>\naround people who love you.  You need more than I can give, though, <br/>\nemotionally and physically.  Please don&#39;t be afraid of trying something new.  Look <br/>\nwhere the familiar has gotten us!   This is really an opportunity to create new <br/>\nthings in your life with the help of good medical care and spiritual/emotional <br/>\nhelp.  Let&#39;s let go of the past and look forward to new things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it, you are NOT responsible for &#39;helping&#39; or &#39;healing&#39; your <br/>\nmother.  You cannot make her whole (she already is whole, btw!).  You can offer <br/>\nacceptance and information and express your own love and limitations. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Allyson.... Thank you for writing to the group.....<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/25/2004 12:25:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n Allyson wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; .
