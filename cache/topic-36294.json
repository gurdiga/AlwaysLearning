If they say no, which the option is always there, there is no<br/>\n&gt; coercion at all,the parent just accepts the child&#39;s choice.What do<br/>\n&gt; they do differently that the children respect the parents natural<br/>\n&gt; authority?

I will stop violence in my home, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m not going to &quot;do what it takes&quot; to stop swearing.  We don&#39;t <br/>\nhappen to swear in our home (the kids would probably say that I have <br/>\nthe &quot;dirtiest&quot; mouth and that&#39;s for saying &#39;crap&#39;).  And if something <br/>\nis theirs and they want to destoy it, well...that can be a lot of <br/>\nfun!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Will you physically<br/>\n&gt;restrain? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  I have a two yo.  Sometimes when he&#39;s frustrated and can&#39;t figure <br/>\nout how to communicate he&#39;ll hit.  I will put my hand between him and <br/>\nmyself or whoever he&#39;s hitting at.  If he senses that I am trying to <br/>\nhonestly discern his problem that will probably be enough.  If he&#39;s <br/>\noverwrought and tries to keep hitting then I would hold him so that he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t inflict injury on anyone.  But there&#39;s a BIG difference <br/>\nbetween holding a child with frustration in your heart and in your <br/>\nvoice and berating them for their behavior and holding them with love <br/>\nand concern and really trying to figure out what&#39;s causing their <br/>\ndistress.  And even in that second scenario there&#39;s a difference <br/>\nbetween loving them calmly and maturely or with whining and cajoling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Will you hit that child? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  How illogical would that be?? &quot;I&#39;m going to hit you to get you to <br/>\nstop hitting.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What do you do when you stand in<br/>\n&gt;between fighting siblings and they don&#39;t stop? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That depends on their age.  One thing I would do no matter WHAT their <br/>\nage is try and figure out how their environment has been contributing <br/>\nto their behavior.  Are they looking for power because something has <br/>\nbeen making them feel powerless??  Has it been me?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How is this so<br/>\n&gt;different than being punitive? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How is what different?  Is there an assumption being made here?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Is it better to have a physical or<br/>\n&gt;verbal fight with your child when they are now in a rage and so are<br/>\n&gt;you? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another assumption.  Start thinking about what you can do to not go <br/>\ninto a rage yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What about when they are bigger? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All the more reason to change the path.  But it sounds here that the <br/>\nthinking is to change the children when most of the change needs to <br/>\nhappen with the adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What if they win,do you then<br/>\n&gt;have to call the police like you would if an adult started acting so<br/>\n&gt;wild?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, some things depend on the age.

I would  <br/>\nlearn one and LOVE it, and the newest was always my favorite, and I  <br/>\nwas thrilled to know these pieces of history.  Then I would hear  <br/>\nanother version of the same ballad and be disturbed--sometimes  <br/>\ndistraught, that now mine wasn&#39;t IT, the &quot;real one.&quot;  But that&#39;s what  <br/>\nmakes ballads wonderful, is that each is one of a larger family of  <br/>\ntraditional ballads.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I was 17 or 18, I started loving finding more ballads.   <br/>\nBut here&#39;s what helped (besides just age and maturity):  Finding the  <br/>\n*third* version.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there were two, it seemed like I had to choose one and reject  <br/>\nthe other.  When there were three, or four or five, it became a  <br/>\ncollection.  Sometimes I could choose one or the other depending on  <br/>\nthe audience.  SCA/medieval event?   Singing for 12 year olds in the  <br/>\nclassroom?  A party with other folksingers?  Different  <br/>\nconsiderations, different choices.  I know two versions of Matty  <br/>\nGrove all the way through.  One is fast and one&#39;s very slow and a  <br/>\nlittle monotonous, but more effective if the audience is in the mood  <br/>\nfor a serious dramatic ballad.   One of the best preserved and oldest  <br/>\nballads I know, that I got from tradition directly (from Beth  <br/>\nVanOver, Jean Ritchie&#39;s cousin, from one of their older uncles) has  <br/>\nwonderful lyrics but sounds like cowboy music.  That&#39;s not a problem,  <br/>\nmusicologically.  But I don&#39;t sing it at SCA events because it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;evoke the period.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBlah blah blah, but that&#39;s all to say that living by principle isn&#39;t  <br/>\nthe same as living by a set of rules.  It seems the same at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never have a rule about what I would and wouldn&#39;t talk to my  <br/>\nchildren about, because I talk to them as people.  I&#39;m not working  <br/>\nfrom a script.  I think that it&#39;s dishonest NOT to tell a child at  <br/>\nsome point that he does NOT have the right to act anyway his mother  <br/>\nwill allow him to act.  Historically, some people&#39;s mothers have  <br/>\nencouraged them to murder and rob.

In my opinion, that&#39;s not what we are raising our<br/>\n&gt; children to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my situation though, I see the opposite. Chidlren who are treated with<br/>\n&gt; respect, equal to that respect that adults are given, are respectful<br/>\n&gt; children. Of course we all have our days. Bigger group dynamics often seem<br/>\n&gt; to be times when I notice play being abit more tricky for some kids (and<br/>\n&gt; adults!). Times when children have to do things they&#39;d really rather not be<br/>\n&gt; doing like: shopping, waiting for longish periods of time, having only<br/>\n&gt; adults around with no children to interact with, and also when they are<br/>\n&gt; tired or hungry, or thirsty or sick or cold.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Putting your opinion on what things &#39;look&#39; like without really looking at<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s happening for individual children to cause some of the behaviours is<br/>\n&gt; often when people judge certain parenting styles unfairly. I think that<br/>\n&gt; those judegments are based on a lack of connecting with children&#39;s needs the<br/>\n&gt; way adults seem to be able to connect with adult needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kim H<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Rod Thomas<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 09, 2008 10:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [AlwaysLearning] FW: [NoMoreSpanking] permissive parentingbratty<br/>\n&gt; kids and parental authority<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is from another list.

In my opinion, that&#39;s not what we are raising our children to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my situation though, I see the opposite. Chidlren who are treated with respect, equal to that respect that adults are given,  are respectful children. Of course we all have our days. Bigger group dynamics often seem to be times when I notice play being abit more tricky for some kids (and adults!). Times when children have to do things they&#39;d really rather not be doing like: shopping, waiting for longish periods of time, having only adults around with no children to interact with, and also when they are tired or hungry, or thirsty or sick or cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting your opinion on what things &#39;look&#39; like without really looking at what&#39;s happening for individual children to cause some of the behaviours is often when people judge certain parenting styles unfairly. I think that those judegments are based on a lack of connecting with children&#39;s needs the way adults seem to be able to connect with adult needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim H<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Rod Thomas <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 09, 2008 10:51 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] FW: [NoMoreSpanking] permissive parentingbratty kids and parental authority<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is from another list.
