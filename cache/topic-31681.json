My interest in unschooling began sometime in the 8th<br/>\ngrade or the latter parts of 9th grade. Reading The Teenage Liberation<br/>\nHandbook was a real eye opening experience for me! It helped that I<br/>\nwas also becoming interested in political theory that was skeptical of<br/>\nthe desirability of rigid authority and power structures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I won&#39;t go into that here, because I saw Sandra Dodd ask that<br/>\npolitical discussion be excluded from the list.

I am 20 now, and I&#39;ve completed three semesters of college. I<br/>\nhad two classes in the first two, and I completed three this last<br/>\nsemester. I have all A&#39;s and B&#39;s, except for two D&#39;s during a semester<br/>\nI was really depressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, listening to the lectures is interesting, and I do enjoy<br/>\none on one interaction with a professor here or there, but I really<br/>\ndislike the grading/stamp of approval aspects of it. I don&#39;t mind<br/>\ngetting feedback on projects I undertake in life, but I feel that<br/>\nletter grades don&#39;t tell anything substantive, except that I did or<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do what was of asked me to a certain extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that so much of the world seems stuck on people being<br/>\nable to show they&#39;ve been a cog in the machine, or jumped through<br/>\ncertain hoops whether or not they really wanted to. I feel that I<br/>\ncould acquire knowledge and skills on my own in an intelligent fashion<br/>\nthat should make me attractive to an employer or customer who values<br/>\nindependence, creativity, and intelligence. I have high medical costs,<br/>\nso I need a way to afford health insurance, and I know that a<br/>\nprofessional job usually has that. I am also planning on leaving the<br/>\nUnited States and wonder about how immigration authorities in New<br/>\nZealand will look upon me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am curious about is non-collegiate paths that lead to a fairly<br/>\ndecent income, and if anyone has had the experience of successfully<br/>\ngetting an enjoyable job based on an unschooling collegiate portfolio.<br/>\nAlso, if anyone knows about charities that pay for healthcare costs,<br/>\nthan that would be helpful too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\n<br/>\nVenus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVenus Cassandra<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifeloveandliberty.com/\">http://www.lifeloveandliberty.com/</a><br/>\nPhilosophical Anarchism, Free Market Economics, and Cultural Bohemianism<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Life_Love_and_Liberty/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Life_Love_and_Liberty/</a><br/>\nAlliance of the Libertarian Left<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://all-left.net/\">http://all-left.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32011,"nextTopicId":31989}}
