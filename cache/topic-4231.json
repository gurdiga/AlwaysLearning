In my experience with the unschoolers in my city, many of them unschool everything but math.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1930&#39;s L. P. Benezet, a Superintendent in Massachussets, experimented with dropping math from the curriculum of his public schools until 6th grade. His results might be encouraging for anyone who is struggling with what to do about math with their unschool kids. (I was trained as a teacher and love academic educational philosophy type stuff, even though and in some ways even more now that I unschool my children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a tidbit: &quot;In other words these [6th graders], by avoiding the early drill on combinations, tables, and that sort of thing, had been able, in one year, to attain the level of accomplishment which the traditionally taught children had reached after three and one-half years of arithmetical drill.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the link to describe how he got started in his experiment: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/1.html\">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/1.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he expanded the dropping of math from the curriculum to other classrooms, here is the compromise he worked up with the hesitant principals.

That&#39;s exactly how I felt, like they were holding back  something <br/>\nfrom me.  I remember being 10, in 5th grade, and I could NOT  &quot;get&quot; long <br/>\ndivision.  I talked in circles with the teacher and I sat at my  desk and stared <br/>\nthe problems and my eyes got all watery.  I *wanted* to get  it.  I thought I <br/>\nunderstood what they were saying, but it wasn&#39;t coming  together.  Finally, <br/>\nafter what seemed like weeks of sitting down to do long  division in class, I <br/>\nwent to Mr. Crowell, and as he explained, I *got* it.   I was so <br/>\nmad/relieved/frustrated that I burst into tears and almost screamed,  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just <br/>\ntell me that in the first place?!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n*Fat Mr. Crowell, always my favorite teacher, was so kind to me when he saw  <br/>\nthe tears, but it was too late by then.  Long division had created trauma  in <br/>\nmy young life.  The frustration had robbed the joy of  accomplishment.<br/>\n <br/>\nI dunno, Dar.  I might ask her to take a break.  When Will wanted  to be able <br/>\nto ride his bike and just couldn&#39;t and got so frustrated about it,  we&#39;d have <br/>\na talk about brain development.  If there are no other better  ideas, what <br/>\nelse is there except that it will come with time?  When I am  working on tough <br/>\nproblem (usually life, not math, related), going about my  business and parking <br/>\nthe problem on the back burner allows me to think more  clearly about the <br/>\nthing later.  Especially if I&#39;m feeling anxious.  I  call it &#39;allowing time to <br/>\npass&#39;.  The old &quot;sleep on it&quot; thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe the pressure Rain is putting on herself to &quot;catch up&quot; is blocking her  <br/>\nability to think clearly?   Maybe the math books need to be removed  from <br/>\nbetween you for a while?  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n*Mr. Crowell looked like Humpty-Dumpty...and egg on legs.  He  had hair <br/>\nlonger than his shoulders and a beard.  He always wore dress  pants, a short <br/>\nsleeved dress shirt and a tie, typical teacher-wear for 1971, and  he looked a <br/>\nlittle greasy, and was always sweating.  I was always afraid  that he smelled, but <br/>\nI never smelled him when he was near me.  When we  sat in our desks and he <br/>\nwalked near, all you could see was the bottom half of  him, from his belt down.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s how round he was.  He was the one who  was hired to institute the open <br/>\nclassroom experiment in my school, and I LOVED  him.  He was teacher of the <br/>\nyear in Illinois once and he wrote to me after  we moved away.  I have tried to <br/>\nfind him online, but I realize now that his  weight probably made for a short <br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210326145,"authorName":"apfel bluete","from":"apfel bluete &lt;apfelbluete_0@...&gt;","profile":"apfelbluete_0","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Math","postDate":"1115117890","msgId":22109,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNTAzMTA1ODEwLjE5OTA2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxMzA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"NjY2Nw=="},"prevInTopic":22108,"nextInTopic":22111,"prevInTime":22108,"nextInTime":22110,"topicId":4231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi- Here below is a review of Frank Smith s book posted to show another point of view.

N. Ruane <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nThe declared intention of this book is to offer insights to those who wish to learn mathematics, or to teach it. It is based upon the premise that there exists something referred to as a &#39;glass wall&#39;, which is said to be an ongoing impediment to mathematical understanding. <br/>\nOn reading the book, one soon realises that by the word mathematics the author really means basic arithmetic, although there is some mention of geometrical ideas. This is compatible with his statement in the introduction that the text is intended to include teachers involved with primary education. However, primary mathematics, in many countries, includes many more themes than arithmetic (algebra, probability, shape and space, problem-solving skills etc). Nonetheless, Frank Smith uses his comments about children&#39;s difficulties with basic number work to form various generalisations about the learning of mathematics as a whole. <br/>\nMy chief reservations about this book fall into three categories, as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\n   I still don&#39;t know what is meant by a &#39;glass wall&#39;, since the concept is never properly defined. Why not use alternative metaphors such as &#39;brick wall&#39; or &#39;dense fog&#39;? Glass walls are transparent and one can gain much understanding of the outside world by gazing through the windows of a train or those of one&#39;s own home. To my mind, it isn&#39;t clear whether the author believes that this entity arises from inappropriate teaching or whether it is due to the inherent nature of mathematics itself. To what degree is it due to both of these factors? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   In the teaching of mathematics, it is soon realised that some concepts and skills are very difficult to teach from the point of view of children&#39;s understanding. For example, how can one establish pupils&#39; understanding of the traditional algorithm for doing long division? What physical models can possibly show that 1/3 = 0.3333...? Can the multiplication of negative numbers have a place in a child&#39;s mathematical conceptual framework? Can it ever made comprehensible? <br/>\nIn other words, mathematics can sometimes seem difficult because much of it is difficult, but this, for many learners, is part of its appeal, which is something not fully explored in the book. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Much progress, in the world of mathematical education, has been made by basing the teaching of it upon practical work with appropriately chosen apparatus. For example, Dienes base 10 material is an excellent medium for developing of understanding of place value. Geostrips are a wonderful teaching aid for the exploration of 2d polygonal figures etc, etc. However, Frank Smith makes many comments of the following sort: <br/>\nThe world of mathematics doesn&#39;t arise from the physical world... except to the extent that it has its roots in the human brain, and it can&#39;t be made part of the physical world&#39; <br/>\nIf, by this, he means that a concept is not the same thing as an object representing it, I can see some truth in it. Otherwise, it is not the sort of precept upon which to form an approach to the learning of primary mathematics. But then there is the following contradictory statement of page 13: <br/>\nThe structures of mathematics do not need a human brain or a physical world to support them. <br/>\nOverall, I find that many of the issues about the learning of mathematics are discussed in a way that tends to obfuscation rather than clarity. I offer two more examples by way of illustration. <br/>\nIn the formation of children&#39;s concept of cardinal number, there is a range of practical activities that are based upon the Russell definition, which says that &#39;a natural number is an equivalence class of finite sets under the relation &quot;is in 1-1 correspondence with&quot;.&#39; Therefore, to establish the concept of three, teachers will direct children&#39;s attention to a wide variety of class representatives, such as a set of three bananas, a set of three blind mice, the three bears, the three wise men etc. Yet what are readers to make of statements like that on page 35, where it is said that: <br/>\nNumbers don&#39;t derive their meaning from anything in the physical world, but from something in our mind... <br/>\nAnd, on page 4: But in fact, holding up three objects to illustrate the meaning of the word three explains nothing at all... <br/>\nFinally, I refer to the discussion of the topic of fractions, discussed in chapter 10, called &#39;Numbers between Numbers&#39;. What on earth is one to make of the following three statements, all made within a few pages of one another? <br/>\n... fractions are numbers and can be treated in exactly the same way as whole numbers. (p. 93) <br/>\nRatios aren&#39;t numbers- they are relationships between two numbers. (p. 96) <br/>\nTo sum up, a fraction is a ratio or proportion of the numerical distance between one number and the next. (p. 96) <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this is an example of what the author meant when he included, in the title, the clause &#39;Why mathematics can sometimes seem difficult&#39;! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I read Marvin Gardner for fun, my favorite &quot;job&quot; is teaching math prep for the GRE and GMAT, and when I can&#39;t sleep at night I often play with numbers in my head. Perhaps this is the problem, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Rain was little, we had great fun with lots of mathy stuff. We played lots of games, and she had a srorng understanding of lots of mathematical concepts because of that. We used to go to the Lawrence Hall of Science and play their math games for hours... Hex, Nym, Ice Cream combos, all that. At 6 or 7 she found the binary number machine and spent 45 minutes working out how to write all sorts of numbers in Base 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t do a lot of arithmetic. She did love to add things in her head, and could add fairly big numbers when she was fairly tiny. When she was 7 or 8 she wanted to learn how I added bigger numbers (with regrouping), and after that she spent 6 months doing this anywhere she went, with trillions and billions and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe never went much beyond this, and now she&#39;s 12. Which would be fine, really, except that 6 months ago or so she decided that she wanted to get &quot;caught up&quot; and probably take some classes at the community college, and/or go to school. So, we had some Key to math booklets that we bought a year and a half ago, when she was in a show and all the other kids were doing homework, and she wanted some homework too. I&#39;ve offered to look for other things, or try other ideas, but she says she likes these.  She set up a schedule for herself to &quot;do math&quot; (meaning work in the booklets), and asked if I&#39;d be available to help her during these times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been pretty much a disaster, for 3 months or so. The first issue was when I tried to explain what division meant, when she asked. I drew pictures and circled groups, I got her multiplication chart out and tried to explain how the process was reversed in division, I tried to get objects but she very vocally objected. She objects to pretty much any way I try to explain anything, and she really doesn&#39;t like it when I draw things out. &quot;Just tell me!&quot; she says, but when I tell her she says she doesn&#39;t understand, and when I ask what part she doesn&#39;t understand she says, &quot;Everything!&quot; It was like she thought there was some piece I was keeping from her, some important bit of information, and she was so angry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk with another unschooling mom about it all, at the time, and came to the conclusion that maybe the problem was that she was so comfortable with addition, and more comfortable with multiplication and subtraction (although she doesn&#39;t have those &quot;facts&quot; memorized, as I think she does with addition), and when she couldn&#39;t mentally conceptualize the division problems like she does with the others, she thought there must be something wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should mention that she figured out on her own how to do multiplication problems with multi-digit numbers, with her chart for reference for the facts. She doesn&#39;t use the standard algorithm, but it works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got past division, somehow, but she&#39;s been working her way through Key to Fractions and it&#39;s still fairly miserable. She&#39;s finding equivalent fractions, and seems to understand it, but when she asked me to check it over she&#39;d made lots of mistakes. I tried to explain what she was doing wrong and she didn&#39;t want to hear it again, she was totally focused on what she should do to get the right answer, and angry because she said I&#39;d explained it wrong. I was explaining how the book did, I thought, but who knows. She won&#39;t generally let me say as much as I want, or draw diagrams, which is how I feel most comfortable explaining. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, she says she hates math. I&#39;m frustrated, she&#39;s frustrated. She doesn&#39;t want to give up on this &quot;catching up&quot; in math idea. She doesn&#39;t want to try a different book or method, so she says. She wants me to be a better resource, but I don&#39;t know how. She&#39;s also going to visit a school tomorrow - a cool private school, but a school - and she says the math teacher there was really nice (we went to open house).  Maybe she needs a different person to help her with math?
