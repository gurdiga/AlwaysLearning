Didn&#39;t know what to do.  I was standing outside the bathroom door waiting for  2 of my kids to come out.  I was next to the water fountain.  This mother (I gathered) came up with her cart with her 2 (or so) year old in it with 3 other 7-11 year olds.  She turned to them on her way into the bathroom, and said very harshly &quot;stay there...don&#39;t move...don&#39;t leave the baby&quot;.  The 8ish year old comes away to the water fountain (about 4 feet from the cart) to get a drink (just came into the store...hot summer here) and the mother stoped and very harshly said &quot;get back to the cart!&quot;  The child said, &quot;but I&#39;m thirsty!&quot;  Mother said &quot;get back to the cart&quot; (much more harsh).  The child said, &quot;but I&#39;m thirsty!&quot;  Mother said&quot; get back now...1...2(now she&#39;s making her way over to the girl, angrily)...3(while wacking her on the lower back...missed the butt in her<br/>\n anger).  The girl then went over to the cart, rubbing and looking at her back, while the mother went into the bathroom.    I think my mouth was open when the scene ended.   And, also for the record...anglo, no accent...educated, well that depends on in who&#39;s opinion...<br/>\n <br/>\nKaty<br/>\n(lurker who hasn&#39;t introduced herself)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 6 Sep 2004 23:49:27 EDT<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSubject: speaking directly to another mom<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf-price day at Savers, Holly wanted to go.<br/>\nThe parking lot was full.
