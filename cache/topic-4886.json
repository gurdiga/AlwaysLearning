The new Pizza Hut &quot;New<br/>\nYorker&quot; pizza reminds me of lunches scarfing a huge<br/>\ncheesy floppy slice at Escape From New York pizza on<br/>\nHaight street.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy love affair with food, luckily for my husband,<br/>\ncarries over into being a not too shabby chef and<br/>\nbaker myself.  My favorite way to cook involves a lot<br/>\nof improvisation, and I have introduced him to a lot<br/>\nof things he never ate before we were married.  I like<br/>\nto experiement and USUALLY things turn out pretty<br/>\nwell, with the occassional failed experiment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have eaten good food all over the country and<br/>\nwould love to do a food road trip.  What a great idea!<br/>\n I could just taste the smorgasboard of learning<br/>\nopportunities, haha.  I have had good German food with<br/>\nspeatzel (spelling) and sausages and whatnot in<br/>\nLeavenworth, WA.  Family Style restuarants in<br/>\nPensylvania (where you share big trestle tables with<br/>\nother diners and pass around large platters, plates,<br/>\nbowls and baskets of good farm style food were a fun<br/>\nexperience.  That&#39;s where I first had ShooFly Pie.  I<br/>\nLOVE Sopapilla&#39;s as well, which I had on trips to San<br/>\nDiego and to the Southwest, as well as the year I<br/>\nlived in Albuquerque, and I love fry bread too. <br/>\nDevonshire Cream ice cream was wonderful on the<br/>\nCornish coast of England.  I remember having some<br/>\nwonderful fudge in Michigan.  The food in New Orleans<br/>\nwas an memorable experience as well.  It&#39;s been too<br/>\nlong since I hit the road to delight my taste buds<br/>\nwith the diversity of American food that didn&#39;t come<br/>\nwith a drink carrier through a little window into your<br/>\ncar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
