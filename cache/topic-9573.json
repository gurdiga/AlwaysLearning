Sometime in week two, we were at","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1632656263\">Even though it&#39;s been a while....<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got back from three weeks traveling about the US with my darling <br/>\nteenage daughter.<br/>\nSometime in week two, we were at the Prairie Museum in Kansas somewhere (we <br/>\nneeded to stop for gas and, hey, look at that... wanna go check it out?) <br/>\nwhere they had a, get this, SOD house.  Chunks of sod, cut in deep bricks, <br/>\ngrass still included (long dead), dirt exposed to the outside (and inside), <br/>\ngrass on the roof too (on top of wood planks) - and it was structurally <br/>\nsound years and years later!    It was very, very cool.  Literally as well <br/>\nas it was quite warm that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the by, straw bale houses are very fire resistant.  They smoulder, but <br/>\nwon&#39;t burst into flame - even when not &#39;sealed&#39; by an earth plaster or <br/>\nstucco.  They&#39;ve gone upwards of 1500 degrees, when I think it is that wood <br/>\nbursts into flame at 500 or 800 or something paltry like that.  Also, for <br/>\nthe person with the noisy tin roof, it isn&#39;t unusual (kinda) to insulate <br/>\nroofs with strawbales.  You&#39;ve just got to figure out how to get them to <br/>\nstay put, as your roof is already on.  There&#39;s also a straw bale house in <br/>\nNebraska from the late 1800&#39;s/early 1900&#39;s that is intact and just <br/>\nfine.  ...and it not only rains in Nebraska, it snows too!  So long as the <br/>\nbales dry out (or optimally are sealed up in an earth plaster) they&#39;ll do <br/>\njust fine in wet surroundings.  A straw bale home needs good boots and a <br/>\nhat and it&#39;ll be fine.  (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, kudo&#39;s to the person doing the cob house.  I looked into it as a <br/>\nvery cool option, but didn&#39;t want to mess with getting the clay/sand mix <br/>\nright and it looked like it would take longer than bale, so I passed on it <br/>\nso far.  It sure is beautiful, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, I have to unpack.  Unpacking is the worst part of traveling about.<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":71172384,"authorName":"avgjean","from":"&quot;avgjean&quot; &lt;avgjean@...&gt;","profile":"avgjean","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Adobe (Natural Building)","postDate":"1033495130","msgId":9713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFuY25vcStoYWE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTYwMWMyNjk2OSQ0MmM1M2MyMCQwMjAwMDAwM0Bhcy51dGV4YXMuZWR1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":9712,"nextInTopic":9827,"prevInTime":9712,"nextInTime":9714,"topicId":9573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Weeds <br/>\ngrew on it.  If it had been like a moss or grass roof, it would&#39;ve been okay, <br/>\nbut these weeds could make long roots and break through the paper and make <br/>\nthe roof leak, so we had to pull them.  (My dad did anyway.)  The rest of the <br/>\nhouse had been dirt when we moved in, but they put tar and gravel on instead. <br/>\n The reason they didn&#39;t do that on my room is I hadn&#39;t moved in there yet.  <br/>\nIt was a half-in-the-ground storage and canning room.  But when I was 14 and <br/>\nreally wanted my own room, I moved in there.  One wall was all shelves!  <br/>\nAcross was a &quot;banco,&quot; a built in adobe seat, the length of the wall.  That <br/>\nwall had a high shelf of a long, thick board, probably 14&#39; long, a foot wide <br/>\nand 2&quot; thick, and that was structural, totally built into the wall.  The <br/>\nwalls were plastered except that one behind the wall of canning shelves, and <br/>\nthat was original unplastered adobe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved that room!  I ended up only being in it three years, because I went <br/>\nto college early and my parents divorced and my dad sold the house.  I was <br/>\nsad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a photo of that house from the north at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/60s\">http://sandradodd.com/60s</a><br/>\nbut my room was on the east side and doesn&#39;t show at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first marriage, we lived in a farm house with two built-in stoves.  It was <br/>\nan old four-room farm house extended to eight rooms, but all still in adobe.  <br/>\n It had an attic.   After I was gone from there and my sister-in-law (one of <br/>\nthe kids we were raising) was grown and had two kids of her own, she was <br/>\nliving in that house and it caught fire and burned.  Nobody was hurt, but <br/>\nlots of family souvenirs were gone.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe newest two rooms did not burn, because they had a separate, flat roof, <br/>\nand my grandmother&#39;s old piano was in there.  Still is.  A remodel of that <br/>\nhouse built the piano in!!  (We could have made a track of plywood way around <br/>\nthe house and taken it out the back, but it wasn&#39;t worth moving.  It was a <br/>\nreally old piano which had already done the church-nursery circuit in West <br/>\nTexas churches, so now it&#39;s in part of an old ruined house and kids go play <br/>\nit with the sun streaming in.  That&#39;s cool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the fireplace that started the fire.  Insufficient insulation up <br/>\nthrough the ceiling and they didn&#39;t clean the flue enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuthie&#39;s husband built her a bigger, better, adobe house a hundred yards away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix acre farm plots are good for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t live in adobe now, but I wish I did.  It&#39;s warm in the winter and <br/>\ncool in the summer.  I used to want my bed against the wall, so in summer I <br/>\ncould lean up against the cool adobe wall.  And the houses were quieter than <br/>\nframe houses or brick, because the sound is muffled in a nice way.  We used <br/>\nto put pictures on the wall with nails, and then just fill in the holes when <br/>\nwe pulled the (BIG) nails out,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9820,"nextTopicId":9826}}
