Somehow that doesn&#39;t sound right<br/>\nbut I&#39;m sure you get what I mean.  My kids thankfully<br/>\nstill act like kids which I love.  I also have 2<br/>\ngrandchildren who my kids adore, Joey will be 5 in<br/>\nMarch and he is personality plus and Aaron will be 3<br/>\nin April.  The kids are great with the little ones. <br/>\nGoing to the beach would be great.  The kids and I<br/>\nwere just watching home movies the other day and were<br/>\ntalking about how much fun we have going to the beach<br/>\nand lifting up the rocks to see the little crabs and<br/>\nthings and generally exploring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you back on this side of the state yet?  I was<br/>\nsorry to hear about your husbands accident!  Does he<br/>\nrent a place over there?  The reason I ask is that my<br/>\nhusband is staying in our travel trailer in Seattle<br/>\nbut he&#39;s going to have to move it soon since the house<br/>\nwhere it&#39;s at is being sold and we&#39;re trying to find a<br/>\ndifferent solution that doesn&#39;t cost alot.... trailer<br/>\npark, house or land sitting, park on someone&#39;s<br/>\nproperty in exchange for my husband mowing their yard,<br/>\netc....  Any ideas?<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11589,"nextTopicId":11725}}
