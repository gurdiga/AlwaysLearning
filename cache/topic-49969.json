However, it is not a case of appreciating what I do. Its about<br/>\nevery time I don&#39;t - less than perfect. Offensive by not being fully<br/>\nworshipping. Basically, my status as atheist makes my existence offensive<br/>\nlol. This is a dead end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do get value from your post though. I see the importance of staying<br/>\nconnected and appreciative of her (much as I want to run for the hills at<br/>\ntimes) for our collective well being as well. She does listen to suggestions<br/>\nfrom me at times. I will try to be more alive to such possibilities and see<br/>\nhow I can be more soft about how I put them. I try, but I&#39;m not certain I<br/>\nachieve it many times. This is a good reminder to &quot;stay with the program&quot; so<br/>\nto say.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour sharing about your experience also brings home the impact that while I<br/>\nam collateral damage, I also am a bridge between two sides. I may not want<br/>\nthat role, but it is. If I can&#39;t change it, how can I be alive to it so that<br/>\nI use it not just to make my life livable, but to invite opportunities for<br/>\nfinding joy for my family as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm... tough one, but certainly worth taking on.

Unfortunately, it was a traumatic experience<br/>\nfor Nisarga. He fell asleep waiting for the guests to arrive. Was rudely<br/>\nawakened with a shower of strange things falling on his head. Even I was<br/>\nwearing a traditional sari, which while soft, was a very strange experience<br/>\nfor him. I changed as quickly as I could, and took him into the bedroom to<br/>\ncalm and quieten (and clean). Traumatic, but okay, it was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, the MIL came up with yet another ceremony idea (each time, she says<br/>\nits the last until he becomes a year old - we&#39;ve had 4 of these &#39;lasts&#39; and<br/>\nhe&#39;s 4 months old). I said I was not comfortable with all this, and once<br/>\nNisarga was able to talk and make decisions, she could ask him herself,<br/>\nuntil then, the answer was no.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe gave me a long lecture about religious obligations toward my son, and<br/>\nhow irresponsible I was, and what not. Said son woke up, wanted attention. I<br/>\ngot up to take him in, she took him from me on the pretext of playing with<br/>\nhim. Lecture went on and on and on. Son got upset, started crying. Till this<br/>\npoint, I was calm, matter-of-fact. She kept ignoring all tactful prompts to<br/>\nreturn him, knowing I&#39;d walk out once I got him. Son kept crying, hiccuping,<br/>\nreally upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI blew a fuse and laid out my &#39;final word&#39;. Me no attend, son no attend, me<br/>\nno pay. nada.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe kept holding on to him, telling me that I don&#39;t deserve to stay in her<br/>\nhome and to go away and so on. I simply told her to return my son and we<br/>\ncould talk about this when I return. In the meanwhile to consider carefully<br/>\nif she was serious about wanting me out. For one, her son and grandson would<br/>\nbe out with me. For another, if we took a loan to pay for a new home, we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be able to afford to pay her any money for running the existing two<br/>\nhomes. Finally, her husband has chosen to live apart. She is telling us to<br/>\nget out. Is this driving everyone away what she wants in life?<br/>\n<br/>\nTook son and walked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I hurt her, but I think its better than us both going through the<br/>\ncontinuing pain of expectations, dashed expectations, hurtful behaviour,<br/>\nincompatible religious beliefs, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went out after Nisarga slept, she avoided the subject. I left it<br/>\nalone figuring that if she really wants it, she will bring it up. Till then,<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to trigger such subjects. Tempting as it feels to ditch her,<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t really sane enough to be let loose on the world, and her husband<br/>\nand younger son couldn&#39;t care less. My husband cares, but if the choice is<br/>\nhis son and me and her.... nope. I care (I haven&#39;t suffered for as many<br/>\nyears), but this often gets on my nerves, particularly since the others just<br/>\nshun her, and I can see how much she is hurt by that. It feels incredibly<br/>\npowerless to see her doing those same things over and over and get hurt over<br/>\nand over.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am. Wondering if this temporary subdued version that usually lasts<br/>\nfor two days is a good opportunity to also establish some ground rules on<br/>\nher treatment of my son (playful hitting, forcibly turning his head away<br/>\nfrom certain things, taking his toys away, etc) or if it would be like<br/>\nhitting her when she&#39;s low.....<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49998,"nextTopicId":50049}}
