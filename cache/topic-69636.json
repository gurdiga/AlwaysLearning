She and I are often the last ones up after her two sisters and dad are asleep. It was close to midnight and I was reading on this list on my cell phone and sometimes chatting with her in my bed.   I thought she had fallen asleep until she said, &quot;I am thankful for a warm bed&quot; (I smiled) &quot;and a good mom&quot; (smiling bigger) &quot;...and TV.&quot;  (I laughed out loud). &quot;What? I am&quot;  I said, &quot;I know.  That was beautifully expressed.&quot;  And she promptly fell asleep still smiling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realized today that without this list and the advice so generously shared here, this sweet little moment wouldn&#39;t have happened in my life.  Barbie, TV, and late nights with my fellow night owl would have all been resisted by me.  So that&#39;s one of the things that I&#39;m thankful for, the ways in which the advice freely shared here on Always Learning have helped me to see, share, and support joy in my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nikole</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69635,"nextTopicId":69645}}
