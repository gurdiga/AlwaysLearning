He was pacing the house and seeming close to tears.  I new he was missing his best friend.  We all threw on our coats and went outside.  We weren&#39;t even outside ten minutes when the boys spotted a salamander.  They had been hoping to find one since they became interested in amphibians this spring.  I keep several empty aquariums that I have picked up over the years at second-hand shops.  Before long, the boys were making a habitat for their new friend.  By evening, they were watching youtube clips about salamanders and we were looking at web sites to determine what type of salamander we had.  We ended up learning all about the life cycles of these little beings and what stage our salamnder is in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Jake went to bed, he was so happy and really, the whole house felt happy.
