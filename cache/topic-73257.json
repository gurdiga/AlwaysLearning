I don&#39;t know what instruction he received in the two years he was in school but practically no attention was given to spelling after he was removed at the age of seven. I&#39;ve never thought to ask him, and he&#39;s not here right now, but since he has consistently preferred playing videogames or watching TV to reading books, I suspect his learning method is visual in a similar if not the same way as described in the above article.</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Two things I remember from time with both of my children when they were small. I always used the term &quot;standard spelling&quot; rather than &quot;correct spelling&quot; because in my view there&#39;s really no such thing as correct spelling, there&#39;s only spelling that a majority of members of a society agree on - even when the spellings make no sense, which is often the case in English (I wonder if it&#39;s because of the number of words in the English language that originated in other languages - Latin, Danish, French, for example - and the pronunciation changed over time while the spelling didn&#39;t). Secondly, I never commented on &quot;creative spelling&quot;. I regarded it as part of the process of arriving at standard spelling, the way the word was spelled right now, that&#39;s all. Standard spelling is useful in most adult situations, however daft some of it appears, but I agree totally with your observation that, regardless of spelling, if a piece of writing communicates the message the writer intends it to communicate, it has done its job.</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Bob</p><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygroups-quoted\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygroups-quoted\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;melissa.cossey@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1734501523ygrps-yiv-1584340150\">Hello! I have a question about spelling. My son, 7, just started to do some independent writing. He asks me when things are spelled right or wrong. Sometimes he gets upset if I tell him the correct way. From the beginning we have always said, of writing, if you know what it says or you can tell the person you&#39;re writing to what it says then it has done its job. But now that he&#39;s such a fluent reader he can TELL it&#39;s wrong, he just can&#39;t get to how it&#39;s right on his own and I&#39;m not sure what I can do differently besides calmly spelling it for him or pointing out &quot;tricks&quot; to remember.

He likes clues.  He doesn&#39;t like when I do it for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen apps for phones that have spelling programs that use voice recognition as well as manual input.  My husband has a voice recognition program for dictation.  Ethan enjoyed playing with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I do (I&#39;m not a good speller), and I&#39;ve noticed Ethan doing too, is input a word in the search bar of google and let it find the correct spelling for me.  Sometimes with spellcheck in certain programs Ethan will keep iterating on a word until it is no longer underlined for being spelled incorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Spelling Anxiety","postDate":"1389456523","msgId":73264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzODk0NTY1MjMuNDcyNjMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PHZ1bWczeDBxMHN1M2o4NGM4aHRrazJzMi4xMzg5NDUwMDI0MjU0QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PHZ1bWczeDBxMHN1M2o4NGM4aHRrazJzMi4xMzg5NDUwMDI0MjU0QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73262,"nextInTopic":73266,"prevInTime":73263,"nextInTime":73265,"topicId":73257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my kids asked me to spell something I either did spell it out or wrote on a piece of paper.
