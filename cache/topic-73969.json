AE works from the strong theoretical and philosophical understanding that one cannot learn under coercion. Whereas unschooling seems to come from a more positive root of the idea that children learn best when they are happy and feeling connected. </div><div><br></div><div>Unlike with unschooling, there is not prolific writing around about AE but as with unschooling there is a significant amount of misunderstanding around about it so that some families that AE will not look like what Jan Fortune-Wood described. Some think it means &#39;child led&#39;, some think it means &#39;only when it comes to academic subjects&#39;, some think it means benign neglect or &#39;let your kids do whatever they like with no parental support&#39;...the same misunderstandings people have frequently about unschooling. Happily, though, there is extensive and ongoing discussion about unschooling to help people get their heads around its true meaning. ..something AE lacks.</div><div><br></div><div>However, there is nothing in AE writing (apart from writings by people who don&#39;t get it) to suggest any of the things you mention, Sandra. School at home is not AE. Relationships and connection definitely comes first and many AEors come to it from attachment parenting. I don&#39;t think AEors would see themselves as educating their children either...I think Sarah&#39;s comment came from the powers-that-be&#39;s idea that we need to educate our children in some way.</div><div><br></div><div>I think if I came to the US and stayed with a number of families who said they were unschooling, I&#39;d find people doing things that didn&#39;t fit with your writing, Sandra. If one googles unschooling, as with AE, one will find plenty of misinformed writing about the topic that could well lead you astray and give you the wrong idea about that philosophy of family living and learning. </div><div><br></div><div>Essentially, though, if you spent time with an AE family that really got it you&#39;d find they looked really very similar to an unschooling family that really got it: parents sharing ideas with their children, trying to find ways to take them places they want to go and help them do things they want to do, not letting their children hurt others or harm others&#39; things. You&#39;d see love and connection and joy prioritised over coercion and fear. </div><div><br></div><div>I may be wrong, but try as I might, I really cannot find any vast differences between true AE and true unschooling. Certainly AE looks to me like nothing you&#39;ve described, Sandra. </div><div><br></div><div>There does tend to be a lot of political action amongst AEors...I guess they are the ones who&#39;ve done the most extensive learning about how children learn so feel the most strongly about protecting their right to provide whatever education they understand as being best. But being political is not a prerequisite of AE.</div><div><br></div><div>Clare</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"font-size:75%;color:#575757;\">Sent from Samsung Mobile</div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69403,"nextTopicId":73983}}
