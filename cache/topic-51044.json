My 3rd daughter preferred to be naked until she figured things out by herself. She hates getting her panties dirty and she hates the feel of pull ups. I got her some cloth diapers and some training panties but she hated those too. Her preference was to be naked. She rejected any and all bottom coverings because she wanted to be naked. She went through a period where she even slept naked. The only time she would get dressed is when we left the house. We tried to minimize those times because of her clear dislike for getting dressed/wearing bottoms. I think her preference for being naked came from the fact that the material rubbing against her skin confused her and made it difficult for her to tell when she had to potty. She had to sort out all of those sensations and the bottoms were getting in her way. Now that she has figured out the potty, she chooses to wear underwear.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Connie<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] poop, take 3","postDate":"1267025177","msgId":51099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3MEM1OUNDLUVDMjUtNDZCOS1CMkM1LTAyRkJCMTcxNThCQkBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2MjEyMS41MzgyOS5xbUB3ZWI1NzIwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2NzA3MC4xNTYxLnFtQHdlYjU3MjAzLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIzMTU0N2o0YjZhMTdlZW42ZDdlMTU5OWQ0ZDY2YTJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NDEyMjEuODkwMTEucW1Ad2ViNTcyMDEubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTA0MDQ1LjcyMDY0LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0OTQxOTQuNDI2Mi5xbUB3ZWI1NzIwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+IDw3RkZERjBBQS0zMEI4LTQ0MDQtOTg4Ni02REQ5NDUyRjhBRERAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw5NjIxMjEuNTM4MjkucW1Ad2ViNTcyMDcubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51097,"nextInTopic":51114,"prevInTime":51098,"nextInTime":51100,"topicId":51044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This theory got support from my first child, who asked to learn to pee in the potty at 26 months and never went back to daytime diapers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, one&#39;s second or third child often blows up the best-formed theories! Carl asked to try the potty before he was two; then decided to go back into diapers; then asked to go without; then went back into them. Then he wanted diapers sometimes, like if we were going out, because he didn&#39;t want to have to worry about accidents, but wanted to be out of diapers at home. Then he went through a LONG period where he was fully in control but wanted me to put a diaper on him when he needed to poop so he could go to a private place. And then eventually (I don&#39;t quite remember when or how), he starting pooping in the potty, too. I&#39;m going to say he was certainly close to 4, at least, by the time this happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that seemed fine, too.

I can imagine that might happen for some kids and not for others. But for right now, it seems like it might be useful to think about what choice is going to remove the most conflict from the situation. If that&#39;s going back into diapers full-time (if he&#39;ll consent to that), that could be a good choice. Sometimes asking myself, &quot;How can I simplify this situation? What factors can I remove?&quot; is helpful.

Even if they run around the house naked, they need the space to potty in private. If they ask me for help, the like for me to be pretty matter of fact about it. They don&#39;t like being praised for going to the potty and they don&#39;t like it when people (dad/grandma/etc.) try to get silly or make a big deal out of things. When my kids are potty learning, I let them know that I am going and I offer to help them if they want/need to go too. If not, no big deal. My almost 3 year old only asks for help in the morning and sometimes at night. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Can I get some input on my wondering if my inconsistency regarding the use of cloth diapers, paper diapers, cotton training underpants, and regular underwear could be a problem?.....Maybe he (and my oldest when she was in the same age and situation) sometimes reject all bottom coverings because of the inconsistency!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like his choice is to be naked. The rejection of bottom coverings may not have anything to do with being consistent. It may be that being naked is what he prefers. I have found that each of my girls had a pretty clear preference. Once they figured out their individual preference, I quit offering other choices unless they expressed dissatisfaction with their current choice at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest two girls preffered disposable pull ups so they could change the wet ones by themselves. My 3rd daughter preferred to be naked until she figured things out by herself. She hates getting her panties dirty and she hates the feel of pull ups. I got her some cloth diapers and some training panties but she hated those too. Her preference was to be naked. She rejected any and all bottom coverings because she wanted to be naked. She went through a period where she even slept naked. The only time she would get dressed is when we left the house. We tried to minimize those times because of her clear dislike for getting dressed/wearing bottoms. I think her preference for being naked came from the fact that the material rubbing against her skin confused her and made it difficult for her to tell when she had to potty. She had to sort out all of those sensations and the bottoms were getting in her way. Now that she has figured out the potty, she chooses to wear underwear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] poop, take 3","postDate":"1267018339","msgId":51093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJFNDNBMTBFLTU5MkYtNDREOS1BQ0ZBLTkxOTNEMjk0MkUwNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2MjEyMS41MzgyOS5xbUB3ZWI1NzIwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2NzA3MC4xNTYxLnFtQHdlYjU3MjAzLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIzMTU0N2o0YjZhMTdlZW42ZDdlMTU5OWQ0ZDY2YTJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NDEyMjEuODkwMTEucW1Ad2ViNTcyMDEubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTA0MDQ1LjcyMDY0LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0OTQxOTQuNDI2Mi5xbUB3ZWI1NzIwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+IDw3RkZERjBBQS0zMEI4LTQ0MDQtOTg4Ni02REQ5NDUyRjhBRERAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw5NjIxMjEuNTM4MjkucW1Ad2ViNTcyMDcubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51091,"nextInTopic":51096,"prevInTime":51092,"nextInTime":51094,"topicId":51044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-As I said, he won t keep his pants on (including diapers/ underpants).

He has no problem climbing onto the toilet the few occasions he has chosen too, using a step stool.  But I have been the one to push the step stool there; not sure if that has been a complicating factor.  But our main floor bathroom is very plain.  I was thinking maybe I could make it more interesting to him with his Spiderman books, some toys.  And you may have hit on something with the privacy.  When all of my kids like to run around the house nude, it didn&#39;t occur to me they might seek out privacy for toileting.  And the downstairs bathroom door is often closed because it&#39;s right there off the family room.  I will start making a point of keeping it open.

I thought choices are good, but he&#39;s not interested in making this choice so I&#39;m making it for him, depending on whether I&#39;m thinking I can handle a mess or not.  So maybe he&#39;s confused; sometimes it&#39;s okay to use his pants for pee/poo and sometimes it&#39;s not.  And then there are the daily naked times to factor into this as well.  Those are almost always initiated by my son himself, either by kicking when I try to dress him or removing the clothes at some point.  Maybe he (and my oldest when she was in the same age and situation) sometimes reject all bottom coverings because of the inconsistency! <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good day everyone.  See you tonight.

Is it easy for him to sit on the big potty? Does he need a step stool or one of those kid seats? Is there more privacy in the front room?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was figuring out the potty, she wouldn&#39;t use the bathroom unless the door was left wide open and the light was left on. If the light was off in the bathroom or in the hallway leading to the bathroom, she would go behind the curtain and paint the window and carpet with her poo. She couldn&#39;t verbalize that the problem was the fact that the light was off. She could turn the light on by herself in other situations but she couldn&#39;t do it when it came to pottying. When we started leaving the light on 24/7, she started going consistently.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my second daughter, she wouldn&#39;t even try to go in the potty until she was tall enough to use the big toilet by herself. She refused to use the small potties because they were for babies. She preferred to go in her pull up because she could do it without anybody knowing when she did it. We have discussed potty stuff and she is horrified by the thought of somebody knowing when she goes to the bathroom. Pottying is something that is very private and very personal to her. She asked me when kids in public school go to the bathroom. I told her that kids in school go as a class or they have to ask for permission. She was horrified by it. She is almost 6 now but that tidbit of information has helped me to understand why it took her so long to use the potty. She needed to do it by herself on her terms without help or interference. She poops in her pull up at night because she hates asking for help while she is in the bathroom. She would much rather poop in her night time pull up and ask me to change her after the fact.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy almost 3 year old has figured out the potty. She went through the painting with poo period. My husband and I didn&#39;t say anything to her about the poo painting. I bought a steam cleaner and began cleaning it up whenever she did it. I didn&#39;t try to reason with her or anything else. When she was big enough to open the bathroom door and do it all herself, she started doing it herself. I assumed that the reason my daughter was pooing and painting was because there was something hindering her ability to go to the bathroom. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was so I tried to pay attention to what was going on in the environment so that I could remove any barriers that might exist. After that, I let her do her thing and would clean up when necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276701487,"authorName":"Michele K","from":"Michele K &lt;mom2rci@...&gt;","profile":"mom2rci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] poop, take 3","postDate":"1266987701","msgId":51070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5NDE5NC40MjYyLnFtQHdlYjU3MjAzLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDA0NS43MjA2NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM2NzA3MC4xNTYxLnFtQHdlYjU3MjAzLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIzMTU0N2o0YjZhMTdlZW42ZDdlMTU5OWQ0ZDY2YTJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NDEyMjEuODkwMTEucW1Ad2ViNTcyMDEubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTA0MDQ1LjcyMDY0LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51069,"nextInTopic":51071,"prevInTime":51069,"nextInTime":51071,"topicId":51044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry, I didn t mean to imply bad.

However, yesterday I offered him an old plastic 2 cup measuring cup, holding it up for him when I saw he was about to pee on the carpet, and he peed in there, watching with great interest; then today when I thought he was just rummaging in the cabinets as he often does, he pulled out the salad spinner and started to squat over it.
