I found this group by <br/>\nlooking for some homeschooling information, and I&#39;ve learned a lot, and <br/>\nordered &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and &quot;Learning all the Time,&quot; which I haven&#39;t <br/>\nread yet. I had never heard of unschooling before, so I don&#39;t feel like <br/>\nI am ready to add anything yet. I&#39;m still soaking it all up. It&#39;s been <br/>\ngreat reading everyone&#39;s messages. Thanks a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to reply to this post because I do have &quot;Muzzy&quot; in Spanish. <br/>\nSince my daughter is so young, we just watch the DVD&#39;s and read the <br/>\nbook, which is the script. I&#39;ve checked out the CD-ROM with her, but so <br/>\nfar it&#39;s nothing she&#39;s been able to really do. I do like it, though, <br/>\nand think it can be handy in the future if she&#39;s interested. She likes <br/>\nme to read the script to her, too, and has asked to watch the DVD&#39;s <br/>\nMANY times over. I think they can soak up a lot from those. It&#39;s pretty <br/>\nexpensive overall, I think, for what you get -- maybe Ebay would have <br/>\nsome for better. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also got some French and Spanish audio CD&#39;s from a catalog called <br/>\nMagic Cabin. They have a website, and I ordered them on-line. They <br/>\nare &quot;Magic French (Spanish) for Kids&quot; and &quot;Fun French (Spanish) for <br/>\nKids.&quot; So far, I like these, too, they have dialog and music, and I <br/>\nthink they can pick all of this up from just listening to it. I also <br/>\ngot their books &quot;First 100 Words in Spanish (French).&quot; This is only <br/>\nbasic vocabulary, but I like the books.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing -- if you can find a cute picture dictionary -- I dug up <br/>\nan old one while cleaning my garage -- my sister&#39;s. Every word has a <br/>\npicture and a sentence. My daughter likes me to read it to her, just <br/>\nlike a story. I guess it helps with the book readings if you can speak <br/>\nthe languages enough to model it for them. I&#39;ve also checked out really <br/>\nsimple story books and fairy tales from the library. These are great. <br/>\nOne of them came with an audio tape, which she could listen to, and <br/>\nwhen I got the book without the tape and was unsure of some of the <br/>\npronunciations, I checked it out again to refresh myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is really long -- sorry -- and my first post!! But I hope <br/>\nit helps.
