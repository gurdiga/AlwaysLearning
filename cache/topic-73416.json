I think for some men that might be frustrating, like a tease, but mine seems like it.  I stopped rolling my eyes at all his &#39;thats what she said&#39; jokes, and now I laugh. I joke back. A nice 20 second kiss in the hallway or at the computer chair can be wonderful.  I stopped getting irritated when he would grab my butt and such- now I flirt back.  He&#39;s been in a much better mood more often since I started making more of an effort in that department.  And I&#39;d sort of forgotten how much I enjoyed it too. My youngest is still nursing quite a bit, and my hormones haven&#39;t shifted back to having any sort of hormonally-motivated desire yet.  It takes some concentrated effort for me to get my mind there, but it&#39;s worth it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: A daring question about intimacy","postDate":"1391471037","msgId":73423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxjcDlqdCs1djRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzRjBGRDQ1LTkxNzItNDRFQy1CM0JCLTVBMzFFNzk3MUIxOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73418,"nextInTopic":73434,"prevInTime":73422,"nextInTime":73424,"topicId":73416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
