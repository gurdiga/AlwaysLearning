A not very  <br/>\nscientific process!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the long run, it&#39;s better not to learn to depend on an outside  <br/>\nsource to push you past rough spots.

(Athletic coaches come to mind.) While  <br/>\nchoosing to have someone push you may look the same from the outside  <br/>\nas someone pushing someone else, it has a totally different feel  <br/>\ninside the person. And since all learning happens inside, what&#39;s  <br/>\nhappening inside the person is more important than what it looks like  <br/>\nfrom outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>\n&gt; things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>\n&gt; like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>\n&gt; a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>\n&gt; wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is true. But what we don&#39;t know is what *else* they would have  <br/>\ndone if they had the freedom. We *can&#39;t* know. And because we can&#39;t  <br/>\nknow, it&#39;s scary. If we&#39;re in a place we like, it&#39;s scary to think we  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have gotten there except by being pushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to take fears out and examine them! Often they encourage us  <br/>\nto do things to avoid worst case scenarios to make us feel comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a way around that fear other than face it. To also see  <br/>\nthe benefits of unschooling until that becomes way more important  <br/>\nthan the unfounded fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd unschoolers *do* introduce their kids to a variety of activities.  <br/>\nWhen the kids show an interest in something, we help them find ways  <br/>\nto explore it. If they want, that can be a mentor who knows an  <br/>\ninstrument well or knows programming if that&#39;s where they&#39;re headed.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids *do* let us know what interests them even when it&#39;s  <br/>\noutside of the things we&#39;re showing them. They may not jump directly  <br/>\nto programming but they will be asking questions  about how people  <br/>\nget things to do things. And it grows from there as we find ways to  <br/>\nanswer their questions, and find others to answer their questions  <br/>\nwhen the need more than we can provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the sticking points to getting unschooling. When we  <br/>\nonly know the success of being led through something, when we see all  <br/>\nthat we needed to know in order to get where we ended up, it seems  <br/>\nimpossible for that to have happened any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest cure to that is seeing kids who have learned loads about  <br/>\nsomething just by playing, wanting to learn it, and doing it. Kids  <br/>\nlearn HTML, Java and Javascript all by wanting to do stuff with it  <br/>\nwithout a programmed process leading them from one thing to another.  <br/>\nThey just plunge in and learn what they need in the moment. (It&#39;s  <br/>\nexactly how I learned HTML.) While the process is chaotic and pretty  <br/>\nmuch untestable since kids are zigzagging from one bit to another,  <br/>\nreaching for what they need to know in the moment without any  <br/>\napparent plan to get &quot;everything&quot;, the process is exactly the way  <br/>\nthey learn to speak English. And that works *way* better than sitting  <br/>\nin a classroom to supposedly learn Spanish!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a lot like the process my daughter is going through  <br/>\nlearning guitar. She told her instructor what kind of music she liked  <br/>\nand they both work together on suggesting what she could learn.  <br/>\nSometimes she picks the songs. Sometimes he does. She likes the blues  <br/>\nbut he had a lot more knowledge and helped her a lot on what he  <br/>\nsuggested she learned. Sometimes she sees someone doing something and  <br/>\ntells him she&#39;d like to learn it. Sometimes she figures it out on her  <br/>\nown. While he suggests and helps because he has a bigger picture of  <br/>\nmusic, she&#39;s in the driver&#39;s seat and can decide which way to  <br/>\nultimately go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds scary when we&#39;re used to programmed learning! What if she  <br/>\nmisses something? Ah, the truth is that programmed learners miss  <br/>\nloads. They just don&#39;t know it! The programmed course leads them to  <br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s everything they need. People buy into that. But when you  <br/>\nwalk into work that first day, you realize how much you don&#39;t know!  <br/>\nAnd a much more useful skill is knowing that you don&#39;t know  <br/>\neverything but having the confidence you can learn it when you need  <br/>\nit -- rather than assuming you need someone to teach it to you :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(That&#39;s not a perfect analogy since you need to know something to get  <br/>\nthe job! But with unschooling, kids are learning all along, getting  <br/>\nwhat they need to know. It&#39;s just a different process. They get to  <br/>\nthe job *better* prepared because they&#39;ve had the freedom to do real  <br/>\nlife versions of the job rather than cramming in esoteric information  <br/>\nthat might suit the type of job they might want one day.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of learning by doing is that we naturally encounter what  <br/>\nwe need to know. We come across problems and learn -- as a side  <br/>\neffect -- what we need to get past it. We encounter everything we  <br/>\nneed in real life contexts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as it was with learning English. Kids don&#39;t set out to learn  <br/>\nEnglish. They set out to get from life what they want. English is a  <br/>\ntool that that use. They don&#39;t even consciously try to improve their  <br/>\ntool use. They just get better at it by using it as a side effect of  <br/>\nwanting something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>\n&gt; seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>\n&gt; but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>\n&gt; somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>\n&gt; look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>\n&gt; on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>\n&gt; sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>\n&gt; teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get on his own.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, people remember the times that worked for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are far more numerous times when it doesn&#39;t work, when it turns  <br/>\nsomeone off to something they would have enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat turned me off to organ was learning songs that I didn&#39;t care to  <br/>\nlearn because there was supposedly a progression one had to go  <br/>\nthrough. The teachers went through it and it got them where they are  <br/>\nso the progression must work. Well, actually what it did was filter  <br/>\nout the people that process  didn&#39;t work for!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is learning to play the guitar by playing the rock songs  <br/>\nshe wants to play. She&#39;s motivated to work past the tough spots  <br/>\nbecause she wants the song. As opposed to the standard method of  <br/>\ncramming in all the stuff kids will one day need to play what they  <br/>\nwant. Most kids never get past the cramming part. My daughter gets to  <br/>\njump right to what she wants and learns what she needs as a side  <br/>\neffect because she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Schuyler about the Karate Kid. Actually I like the scene  <br/>\nbecause I like the feeling of knowing something someone else doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nand making them do things to get them to understand not only what I  <br/>\nknow but that I&#39;m superior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a power trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s a good thing to recognize so we can avoid doing it to our  <br/>\nkids because the other end of the power trip is *not* fun. The  <br/>\nlearner may learn something, but in the process they learn that  <br/>\nhaving power rocks and not having power sucks. It can motivate  <br/>\nsomeone to learn (have power) but it can also motivate people to lord  <br/>\ntheir power over others because they were deprived of power  <br/>\nthemselves. (They become sensei who foist the wax on wax off power  <br/>\ntrip onto their students because it was done to them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re imagining unschooling as parents stepping back and children  <br/>\nlearning everything on their own through their own discoveries, then no.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re imagining children having *the freedom* to explore  <br/>\naccording to their interests, then yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s our job as parents to run the parts of the world we think might  <br/>\ninterest them into their lives. And to help them reach what they&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to reach. And to get out of their way when they&#39;re engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of unschooling is being on the look out for things a child might  <br/>\nlike. Just as you might do for your wife. If you&#39;re in a bookstore  <br/>\nand see a book you&#39;re pretty sure she&#39;d like, you might buy it for  <br/>\nher or at least tell her. Let her know it exists. We do that for our  <br/>\nkids. But more actively since they can&#39;t be as much out in the world  <br/>\nas adults can, won&#39;t be scanning lists of classes and events for  <br/>\nsomething that sounds interesting. We use our superior knowledge of  <br/>\nthe world to filter out the stuff that probably won&#39;t interest them  <br/>\nso they can see the stuff of potential interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* hard to see how it works when the only model someone is  <br/>\nfamiliar with is schooled kids who are being made to learn. Schooled  <br/>\nkids tend to avoid stuff that has the patina of school because they  <br/>\nnegatively associate those things with school. Unschooled kids don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave that. Shakespeare and Spongebob are all equal: something to like  <br/>\nor not like today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>\n&gt; but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>\n&gt; for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>\n&gt; It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>\n&gt; would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>\n&gt; all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The advantage we have is that we know kids (our own and ourselves  <br/>\ntoo!) who have experienced forced learning and natural learning. We  <br/>\ncan see the difference. Those who have only experienced forced  <br/>\nlearning can only imagine what the effect of natural learning is by  <br/>\nextrapolating from forced learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t work. What seems likely to happen isn&#39;t what actually happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for focused, structured, incremental ... I think you&#39;re equating  <br/>\nit with forced learning. The two can be separated! My daughter has  <br/>\nbeen taking college math classes since she was 13. She likes them. To  <br/>\nher they&#39;re fun. Statistics, problem solving, algebra, pre-calculus.  <br/>\nTwo her father taught, all of them she and her Dad did the homework  <br/>\ntogether in the evening. What encouraged her to keep taking classes  <br/>\nwas that his goal wasn&#39;t for her to learn but to have fun. As a side  <br/>\neffect, she did learn. (Or at least did well on the tests which isn&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily the same thing!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my husband does with our daughter is what, I think, people  <br/>\nimagine the ideal of structured learning is. Two people working  <br/>\ntogether, having fun in discovering  things through a structured  <br/>\ncourse. But it isn&#39;t the structured course that comes from. You can&#39;t  <br/>\nsit a child down with a course and expect that magic to happen. It  <br/>\ncomes from someone loving the material, being enthusiastic and not  <br/>\ncaring if the child does the material or not. The goal is to have  <br/>\nfun. If it&#39;s not fun, it gets dropped for something that is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing about focused, structured, incremental learning is that  <br/>\nthe results are a lot easier to see. Structured education is more  <br/>\nsatisfying from someone *monitoring* the learning process. (It&#39;s also  <br/>\neasier for educators to prove to parents, states and the school board  <br/>\nthat learning is taking place.) We *assume* that since we can see the  <br/>\nlearning and the progress that it must be superior to learning  <br/>\norganically.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you prove that? How would you prove it? With a test that is  <br/>\ndesigned to test whether structured teaching has in fact resulted in  <br/>\nlearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan schools prove that their focused, structured, incremental process  <br/>\nworks? They have some kids that come out having done well on tests,  <br/>\nbut they also have kids who don&#39;t. They assume the process is  <br/>\nresponsible for the successes but without a control group how can  <br/>\nthey prove that claim? They can say the failures are the fault of the  <br/>\nkids or family life, but, again, without a control group, how can  <br/>\nthey prove that claim?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real proof is in what unschooled kids do as adults I think. We&#39;re  <br/>\nthe control group. Our kids are learning and moving on in life  <br/>\nwithout forced learning so it *can&#39;t* be the forced learning that is  <br/>\ncausing kids to learn in school. Fortunately we&#39;re paving the way  <br/>\nwith our own kids so you don&#39;t have to just trust that this is all  <br/>\nsome rosy glass type of deal. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95085137,"authorName":"beanmommy2","from":"&quot;beanmommy2&quot; &lt;beanmommy2@...&gt;","profile":"beanmommy2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some good responses to my husband&#39;s concerns","postDate":"1203686833","msgId":32175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwbWlqaCtwc3FhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwNTcwNC43NzU5Ny5xbUB3ZWI2NTUwMi5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32174,"nextInTopic":32176,"prevInTime":32174,"nextInTime":32176,"topicId":32157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Is he *free* to say no <br/>\nbefore the lesson?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like these questions turn everything into a lesson or teachable <br/>\nmoment. Sometimes I feel twinges of envy for those moms like Kim whose <br/>\nchildren apparently accept their suggestions pleasantly. Jayn (8) would <br/>\nabsolutely reject this kind of conversation! For her it is crucial that <br/>\nthings can be enjoyed in the moment without any pressure to become a study <br/>\nproposal. She will usually surprise me by coming back to a topic weeks or <br/>\nmonths later with some remarks. (Jayn rarely asks questions outright - she <br/>\nmakes statements and then checks if she right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA nonchalant &quot;This is baroque music&quot; is probably about as far as I would go. <br/>\nHer answer to volunteered information, ie that she has not expressed <br/>\ninterest in, is usually, &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; I have learnt that I am far better <br/>\noff asking her if she interested in hearing more about whatever the issue at <br/>\nhand is first than getting locked into my need to share my knowledge. (Sigh, <br/>\nand I like to think I&#39;m soooo darn clever.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely suggest any type of class to Jayn, because it would take her <br/>\ninitiative away from her. I have offered her lessons in a couple of <br/>\nsituations that are outside of my experience or would benefit from a group <br/>\ndynamic - including as examples: ballet, martial arts, soccer, gymnastics. <br/>\nShe has tried some, refused others, and said &quot;Not yet&quot; for some. What is <br/>\nbetter for Jayn is to see a martial arts class (just to continue one <br/>\nexample) on tv, or through the window if we are passing a studio, or to hear <br/>\nabout what her friends are doing and begin her slow process towards deciding <br/>\nto try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith books, I tend to just leave them out. I don&#39;t ever talk about someone <br/>\n&quot;studying&quot; a topic if I see one of her friends reading something, or that I <br/>\nam reading myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has an immensely strong drive to be the instigator and controller of <br/>\nher own life. She will not be pushed from behind and she will not be pulled <br/>\nalong from in front. She will refuse to move *even in the direction she <br/>\nwants to go*, unless she is being allowed to set the pace. She will push <br/>\nherself when she is ready much more than any instructor. This is her <br/>\npersonality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fastest way that I could remove her interest in music, karate, fossils, <br/>\nlanguages, Cambodia, religions, math, geography, quantum physics, carpenty, <br/>\nmedicine or waste management would be to guide her into some lessons that I <br/>\nthought were the right way for her to learn about these (or any) topics. She <br/>\nrejects any imposition of structure in her learning - which incidentally <br/>\ndoes not mean that she refuses to conform to the protocols of any class <br/>\nsituation she has chosen. If she finds the protocols too onerous, she leaves <br/>\nthe class with my blessing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn passing I will mention that the most of her personal solidification of <br/>\ninformation comes in the form of making fantasy plays or art work about the <br/>\ntopic - eg: watched a couple of shows about mummies - made doll into mummy - <br/>\nwanted to play Cleopatra - continues to look at shows/books about Egypt <br/>\nintermittently. No lessons, no need to interfere with this process, no need <br/>\nto assess the extent of her knowledge about mummies.  No arrival at the end <br/>\nof &quot;the course&quot; either.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh, ooh. Here&#39;s another example, which is very current and ongoing. Got a <br/>\ndoll dressed in a kimono (a couple of years ago) - Studio Ghibli movies - <br/>\nrecent rediscovery of said doll - interest in other Japanese dolls (modern <br/>\nclothing) and collectible dolls of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; online - I <br/>\nremembered I have the movie on dvd - discussions about kimonos, separation <br/>\nof sisters, dance, geisha as artist, feminism, lack of choices, art <br/>\ndirection, costuming - wants to play geisha (dancing and tea parties!) - <br/>\ncontinues to draw versions of ladies in kimonos and makeup. Other potential <br/>\ntopics lurking in that movie - WWII, sumo wrestling, slavery, tea <br/>\nceremonies, calligraphy - but I&#39;m not going to push them. She&#39;ll come back <br/>\nto them, or not as suit her. Again no lessons, no interference, no <br/>\nassessment, no conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my gosh - I just remembered her Barbie book about an investigation in a <br/>\nJapanese tea house about an antique teapot! Time to get the book out again, <br/>\nwhile the interest is still fresh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from any kind of information pushing being utterly rejected, I have <br/>\nfound that my broad strewing is rarely as helpful to Jayn as more focussed <br/>\nstrewing connected to interests that she already has demonstrated. For <br/>\nexample, her greatest love is dolls of all kinds. So if I find a book, <br/>\nplace, magazine connected to dolls even tenuously, that is the time when I <br/>\nwill say, &quot;Look at this&quot; and be totally ready to back off if she say &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we recently visited the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising <br/>\nexhibit of 2007 movie costumes, Jayn was far more overtly interested in the <br/>\ncostumes from movies she had seen, and also noticed a costume that had a <br/>\nreproduction of an antique doll as part of the display. However a few days <br/>\nlater she surprised me with a conversation about some costumes from a <br/>\ncompletely different movie. I will say that mostly she was more interested <br/>\nin meeting up with her friend at the outing, than the location of the <br/>\nouting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that the resources available to us in a developed nation are so <br/>\nwide ranging and broad, that I would never want to restrict Jayn&#39;s <br/>\nexplorations to what I know about. More fascinating information comes in to <br/>\nour house and to her notice via the tv and internet every day than we could <br/>\never cover through any kind of guided tours!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I see my greater experience as being valuable to Jayn is not in the <br/>\narea of suggesting topics for investigation, but that I have a greater <br/>\nability to research and gather resources/people on her behalf when she <br/>\nexpresses her interest in something. I can be a vector of knowledge for her, <br/>\nrather than the definer of what might be valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I have Wikipedia set as one of my home pages, and daily read the <br/>\nmain featured article and most of the &quot;Did you know...&quot; and &quot;On this day&quot; <br/>\nintros, following some to their pages if they sound interesting.  And <br/>\nsometimes there is an image that strikes me as something Jayn would like to <br/>\nsee, and I invite her to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that if I were accompanying the invitation to glance and my <br/>\ncomputer with a whole lot of pressure (what she would feel as pressure) to <br/>\ntake it further, she would very quickly cease coming over to look.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruly I don&#39;t need to guide Jayn academically.

My post was in response to some of the concerns of a poster&#39;s husband. The last of those concerns sounded familiar to me, and I thought I&#39;d post my response to it. Perhaps it&#39;d be a point of view he (or someone else) might be interested in hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI intended in no way to suggest that my son would be limited to choosing a path that I or anyone else happened to point out to him. Quite the opposite in fact; whether he chooses one of these areas, or any other as a life path is up to him entirely. My only investment is in hoping to expose him to as much as possible so that he has a myriad of paths from which to choose. I no more want him to be an expert in anything than I want him not to be. I do know however that there are certain paths that he *could* choose which would necessitate something typically considered formal guidance/training/teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it sounds like &quot;bliss&quot; is a loaded word.

In our family (as well as the other unschooling families we personally know), we also love to introduce new topics and offer classes/experiences to each other.  My husband and I (and the kids) are insatiably curious about almost everything and that usually spills all over each other and often leads to people learning insatiably and, like your son, stopping when interest wanes.  I&#39;m confused by your saying that your idea of unschooling is more narrow than the &#39;radical.&#39;  I too believe that there is a place for focused and guided learning if that is what the person is into.  My daughter loves to go to her art camp where there is structured, guided learning happening...is her embracing this somehow not &quot;radical&quot; unschooling, in your opinion?  When she took a basket weaving class, it was very focused and guided and she loved it...how is this not unschooling?

Holly is 16 and learned to read on her own.  She  <br/>\nreally cares about spelling and etymology.  She was discussing during  <br/>\nthe game whether Berlin and Burlesque might be related, and said even  <br/>\nthough they probably weren&#39;t, it would help her remember the name of  <br/>\nBerlin.  That&#39;s fine.  Marty is 19 and learned to read on his own and  <br/>\nis a classic lefty/mathish/dyslexic kind of guy, though we haven&#39;t  <br/>\ntalked about that with him.
