Many thanks, Cynthia*********<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know that attachment parenting is any different with an only child (I only had one, so that&#39;s my experience), but The BEST book I read on the subject was, The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff.  There may be newer books on the subject that I haven&#39;t come across though. My dd&#39;s now 12 (almost 13 already!) so haven&#39;t read anything pertaining to small ones lately.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Meghan<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLuggage?
