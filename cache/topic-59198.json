It&#39;s very inspirational. In it:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It does not get more difficult to learn most things later; it gets easier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI immediately remembered how much easier statistics was when I was 43 than<br/>\nwhen I first signed up at 35 and dropped it for later. I couldn&#39;t wrap my<br/>\nhead around it. The same is true for Karl who now finds it easy pick up<br/>\nwhole phrases (like &quot;no soy no dairy&quot; on the coconut milk container) at a<br/>\nglance. That was today. He has been pulling up webpages, glancing at phrases<br/>\nor directions, and reading them with no hesitation or confirmation to make<br/>\nsure he&#39;s right. He knows it&#39;s right. About six months ago he said he would<br/>\nhave to learn the longest words in the world and then he would be able to<br/>\nread, with a look on his face that it seemed impossible to imagine being<br/>\nable to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is like that too. It gets easier and it gets better. I&#39;m having<br/>\nfun watching things develop. It&#39;s like I&#39;m watching a movie and I get some<br/>\ngood lines in my part too. Karl who has always been one to avoid schedules<br/>\nis now interested in winding back his sleep schedule. Who knew. He says it&#39;s<br/>\ntime for bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59031,"nextTopicId":59220}}
