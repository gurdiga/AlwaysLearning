I buy old books just because they are old sometimes, not always because of the content.  I didn&#39;t have much room in my old house, but we just moved here and I have a whole room that I am planning on turning into a library.  Of course, right now it only has one bookcase, one writing desk and the computer in it, but my goal is to have a whole wall of bookcases that I can fill up.  My grandfather was a teacher, too, so I think that is where I get my love of books from.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Alan & Brenda Leonard <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, August 03, 2003 11:17 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] math and books<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  8/3/03 13:14:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; You have 28 full bookshelves?
