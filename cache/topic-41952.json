Is there another list just <br/>\nfor conference/gathering announcements?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the info for a fantastic three night gathering in the beautiful <br/>\nmountains of eastern Tennessee. The dates are March 14th through the <br/>\n17th.  The cabins are super nice, a good size and have fully equipped <br/>\nkitchens. (no tvs, no internet, though there is internet at another <br/>\nbuilding)    We would love to see you there!  There are 30 cabins in <br/>\nall.  (And RV and tent areas.) Twenty cabins are currently reserved <br/>\nspecifically for this gathering, thirteen of which are taken, last I <br/>\nlooked.  The remaining cabins are also possibilities if not taken yet by <br/>\nthe general public.  Here&#39;s the link for the yahoo group list. (though <br/>\nthe list description mentions the last gathering in November &#39;08, not <br/>\nthe one coming up in March) <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutodidacticRadicalGatheringofHomeschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutodidacticRadicalGatheringofHomeschoolers/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the database to see who has signed up for the upcoming <br/>\ngathering!  There is also a link for the state park (Roan Mt.) in the <br/>\nlinks section.   Then start planning on how you can join us!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see lots of you there!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41940,"nextTopicId":41808}}
