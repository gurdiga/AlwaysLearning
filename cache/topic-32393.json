Sometimes they say &quot;READ, you&#39;re six; READ NOW.&quot;    <br/>\nOr they want a very young child to care about tithing or saving money  <br/>\nor having an interest-bearing savings account.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it&#39;s good to suggest that they might want to read some Piaget  <br/>\nstages of child development (which I think everyone should read  <br/>\nanyway, now that the subject is on the table).<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT ON THE OTHER HAND, there are problems with reading a book to see  <br/>\nwhat your child can follow or comprehend or benefit from when your  <br/>\nchild is right there, in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==...says the reason is that your child needs/learns from human  <br/>\ninteraction and TV time diminishes that. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOoooooh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell.

It doesn&#39;t matter, except to remember that if  <br/>\nthat other fully-formed yet young human is learning something, you  <br/>\nmight want to let that continue instead of jealously trying to  <br/>\ncontrol and channel his attention and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor verbal older kids, do they talk about it and ask questions or act  <br/>\nit out?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV question","postDate":"1204049169","msgId":32436,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NzkxNDY0LTI0RkEtNEM4My1BNjcwLTA4QzhEODAxMkY0NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdlYTYzYWY1MDgwMjI1MTk1N3M2MDk2NzczM2lmYzI3YmQ2ZjlkZmU4ZmNlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwdmMzaSt1MjFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MzhDMDk0OTYxMDI3NEYyMTlBQUI1NkVGOTdFNjY5MDlAUm9ieW5QQz4gPDdlYTYzYWY1MDgwMjI1MTk1N3M2MDk2NzczM2lmYzI3YmQ2ZjlkZmU4ZmNlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32435,"nextInTopic":32437,"prevInTime":32435,"nextInTime":32437,"topicId":32393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The link Robyn sent was messed up.

Then he will begin to watch just favorite parts of the movie.  He is 13 now and will still do this - though not as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI clearly remember Mary Poppins and the dance scenes being played over and over when he was about 3 or 4.  Which led to a love of the &quot;River Dance&quot; film we had and he still likes Celtic music - especially bagpipe.  And he knows tons about the history of the Celts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly for our son though he does not only watch, he is usually doing other things too - such as legos or dancing along with the chimney sweeps ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago he wanted to rent the entire series of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;  He ended up with all his &quot;G.I. Joes&quot; action figures out and completely turned the family room into a war zone.  Every pillow and spare blanket was used to make hills and trenches - even the camera tripod was used for a look out tower.  I don&#39;t think he ever finished watching all the shows - but his creative juices were in high gear for over a week.  And that led to more knowledge about WWII.  Oh and at one point he was talking about / investigating scale models (for instance if the camera tripod was in scale to the figures in relationship to a real look out tower and real people.)  He actually used the terms &quot;to scale&quot;    I spent something like 30 dollars to rent those shows but it is like the Visa commercial - price for the learning / activities / contentment / joy / = priceless!<br/>\n<br/>\nThese movies and shows - are almost always a catalist for other activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI must add though - we do have moments now and then when we snuggle up on the couch (yup he is bigger than me and he still lays all over me in a kind of side drape) to watch a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217568290,"authorName":"Laureen","from":"Laureen &lt;splashing@...&gt;","profile":"elementalgrrl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV question","postDate":"1203989157","msgId":32395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDgwMjI1MTcyNWw3YWEyNzg3N3A2ZTgzOTg4NDliMGY0ZmY3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwdmMzaSt1MjFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwdmMzaSt1MjFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32393,"nextInTopic":32396,"prevInTime":32394,"nextInTime":32396,"topicId":32393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heya! ...

My daughter is 20 <br/>\nmonths old. Until she was about 17-18 months she &quot;watched&quot; very <br/>\nlittle TV and it was pretty easy to keep it that way. Sometimes we <br/>\nhad it on and she was playing but she didn&#39;t actually sit and watch <br/>\nfor extended periods of time. We were mostly outside playing every <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as the winter weather has hit and she has gotten older she is <br/>\nwatching more. First she really liked a couple of the Baby Einstein <br/>\nvideos. She is currently hooked on &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit that I find it quite refreshing to find a different <br/>\nperspective on &quot;screen time&quot;. And I hope that as my daughter gets <br/>\nolder that I will achieve with her and our relationship what so many <br/>\nof you have with your children that apply unschooling principles to <br/>\nyour whole life. <br/>\n<br/>\nok, long introduction to get to my question -- is there a certain age <br/>\nwhen you think that having no limits applies (of course offering <br/>\nother fun things to do and not using TV as a babysitter) or does it <br/>\nstart from the time that they can let you know their opinions? I <br/>\nspent so much time feeling guilty about any TV and reading books <br/>\nand &quot;research&quot; that said no TV until they&#39;re 2 that I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nto think. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example-- DD woke up from nap and wanted to watch &quot;Nemo&quot; right <br/>\naway. Of course now I am having the opportunity to right this post! :-<br/>\n) I have to say though-- I love the movie! Sandra I just read your <br/>\narticle about humor/jokes and LOVE all the humor in children&#39;s movies <br/>\nthat is clearly meant for adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, any input on this would be much appreciated. I sometimes feel <br/>\nthat I am just learning how to form my own opinions... that I am <br/>\nfinally waking up and seeing that there are other ways to live and it <br/>\nlooks so good! <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32292,"nextTopicId":32438}}
