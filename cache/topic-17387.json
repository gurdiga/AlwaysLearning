With some members","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-37098677\">Junior State of America - Ages 14-18<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been holding meetings of our Ohio JSA chapter of home<br/>\neducated teens for the past three years. With some members who have<br/>\nmoved or gone on to college, and others who have gone back to high <br/>\nschool, our chapter needs new teen members. And as we enter this <br/>\nexciting presidential election year, here is a great opportunity to <br/>\nparticipate in our government, hands-on. I mean, how can we change <br/>\nanything if we are not willing to participate? As JSA says, democracy <br/>\nis not a spectator sport.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been our chapter advisor and have attended most JSA events in<br/>\nour region. I have to say that this is a great group of teens. They<br/>\npresent themselves very well, and cover the entire political gamut, <br/>\nfrom arch conservatives to anarchists! For those intending to go to <br/>\ncollege, this is an excellent activity that looks really good on <br/>\ncollege and scholarship applications, too.  Plus, it presents an <br/>\nopportunity to meet lots of other teens, to socialize, to meet <br/>\nimportant people in local, state and national government, to practice <br/>\npublic speaking, and to learn hands-on how our government really <br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur district holds its spring session in Columbus, OH, right in the<br/>\nState Legislature, for Spring State and part of the Summer Symposia.<br/>\nThe other parts are held at Ohio State and University of Cincinnati.<br/>\nThen our region&#39;s Fall State is held in Cincinnati (will be<br/>\nelsewhere for other parts of the country, of course), and in February <br/>\nwe journey to our U. S. Capitol for Winter Congress in Washington, <br/>\nD. C. These are all such great opportunities for teens to participate <br/>\nin this totally teen-run group and all its great acitivities. I <br/>\nreally want to encourage others to investigate these programs, start <br/>\ntheir own home ed chapters so that home educated teens have a voice <br/>\nin U. S. politics. If you live in our district (Ohio, Tennessee, West<br/>\nVirginia, Kentucky, Indiana) please get in touch with me. And<br/>\neveryone interested can visit the JSA web site to learn more about<br/>\nJSA in their region of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the year local chapters meet for various activities: debates,<br/>\nthought talks, mock trials, caucuses, and lots of fun, the chance to<br/>\nmeet with other teens from all over the region. Founded in the<br/>\n1930s, this is a nationwide non-profit non-partisan high school age<br/>\npolitical group. We are looking forward to a most interesting year<br/>\nleading up to next year&#39;s presidential election. Email me if you have<br/>\nquestions. Next big event in our part of the country is Fall State,<br/>\nthis weekend in Cincinnati, then Winter Congress with a trip to<br/>\nWashington, D.C., in February.
