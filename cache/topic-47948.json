None of these three have a monthly subscription fee. We know<br/>\na little about them from attending Blizzcon, the Blizzard gaming convention,<br/>\nbut maybe someone who plays them can pipe up with their experience. =======<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDiablo II is another favorite for my 9yo.  He loves the LAN play option.<br/>\nIt&#39;s one of his preferred methods of hanging out with his grandfather.<br/>\nDiablo III is on its way, and Trevor can&#39;t wait.  Every once in a while he<br/>\nturns on the demo video he has of Diablo III just to watch it in<br/>\nanticipation of the latest version of one of his favorite games.  Diablo is<br/>\nclassic hack and slash.  It&#39;s really not a very complicated game, and it&#39;s<br/>\neasy to master by novice players.  However, it is very bloody so if you&#39;re<br/>\nnot into gore, you might want to use caution with this one.  I think there<br/>\nis a setting to turn down the gore, but it&#39;s been so long since I played<br/>\nthat I can&#39;t remember.  I beat the game almost a decade ago, so it&#39; been a<br/>\nlong time. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had StarCraft and the old WarCraft game (before WoW), but I think we<br/>\nthrew them both out because nobody liked them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==== BTW, we *love* WoW. It is more expensive per month than LOTRO ($16),<br/>\nthough.  ======<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a deal on our subscription for LOTRO - I&#39;m not sure what the regular<br/>\nprice is.  It&#39;s probably pretty close to the WoW price.  I was originally<br/>\nagainst a game with a monthly fee because experience with Guild Wars (no fee<br/>\n- but not as fun) taught me that I would have to get at least 4 accounts,<br/>\nand $40-$60/month was scary for me.  However, I found that due to multiple<br/>\nservers we are able to get by with just two accounts.  Also, I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nWoW does this, but with LOTRO you can get a lifetime account for a few<br/>\nhundred bucks and never have to pay that fee again.  I&#39;m seriously<br/>\nconsidering it.  I am a total convert for games you have to pay to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:on video games","postDate":"1255576164","msgId":48005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RDJDMDIxLTJEMzEtNEJBMy05NDk4LUY5MUM3NUE0QzAzREBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0RjdFMUU2REE3NzRBRUZCMDhBNTAyOTYyQTQ1MkVCQFRpbmFQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0RjdFMUU2REE3NzRBRUZCMDhBNTAyOTYyQTQ1MkVCQFRpbmFQQz4="},"prevInTopic":48000,"nextInTopic":48014,"prevInTime":48004,"nextInTime":48006,"topicId":47948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
