Particularly when teachers come<br/>\nalong. It is an outdoor group setting, but I imagine the principle would<br/>\nwork indoors with two people too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI begin the programme with deceptively simple activities, which &#39;seduce&#39;<br/>\nkids into involvement because they are great fun, and seem very easy. It is<br/>\nonly as they immerse themselves in the activity, that they discover that it<br/>\nis not as easy as it seems, but by then, they are so &#39;hooked&#39; that they have<br/>\nno time to worry about if they can do it or not. Of course, I try to keep<br/>\nthe task achievable in the natural flow of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, during the discussions, we talk about perceptions. how it was in the<br/>\nbeginning, how it unfolded, how it concluded, and how much work compared<br/>\nwith what they had imagined going in it turned out to be. I conveniently<br/>\n&#39;forget&#39; to talk about success and failure unless one of the kids brings it<br/>\nup. If they do, I make time to explore ways of measuring success like,<br/>\npersonal bench marks, consistent improvement, enjoyment, etc. In addition to<br/>\nthe accepted &#39;completion of task&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few games that are easy with emerging difficulties later, I throw in one<br/>\nthat seems tough, but turns out doable. One day of this kind of stuff, and<br/>\nthe kids are ready to bite into anything thrown at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have experience spending days at home with kids, so I don&#39;t know the<br/>\nexact activity you could do, but it shouldn&#39;t be rocket science - cards,<br/>\ncastles with sand or scrabble could work. Group discussions could be<br/>\nreplaced by informal conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works so well, that it has almost become a permanent feature of my<br/>\nprogramme designs. It opens up the whole bunch of them. You could measure<br/>\nchange in decibels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do try this, let me know about your experience, because I haven&#39;t<br/>\ndone this in other settings. it would help me understand too.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping son with confidence","postDate":"1267031037","msgId":51107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwMjI0MDkwM3I1YjYyMGQ5MW02ZTE0ZGZhYjhmMWE0NDllQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtMmFqYis1YWdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtMmFqYis1YWdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51066,"nextInTopic":51116,"prevInTime":51106,"nextInTime":51108,"topicId":51066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It may be him always... it may be who he is and how he interfaces with new stuff, his personal style of getting to know things.
