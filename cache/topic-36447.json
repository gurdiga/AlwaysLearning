Last week I went and <br/>\nrounded up all the stray cups and mugs and glasses from the parts of the house that <br/>\nI don&#39;t visit as much when they&#39;re not inhabiting them. Patrick&#39;s favorite <br/>\nPirate mug was sitting by their computer, and I was weirdly glad to have it to <br/>\npick up and wash. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been putting things on each of their beds that normally I&#39;d be showing <br/>\nto them or sharing in some way. It&#39;s kind of fun arranging and rearranging, <br/>\nespecially picking a spot for the racoon skull!
