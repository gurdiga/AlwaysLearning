The dad is very adamant, wants the kids tested and put in public school. Its soooo stressful for the kids, as they are having to study like crazy to get ready for testing the end of next month. The lawyer claims that the outcome depends on how well they do on the test, if they must go to school or not (even tho testing is not a requirement in our state) I can&#39;t believe how their dad doesn&#39;t give a hoot about what his kids want!!!

Luckily we <br/>\navoided all that testing by moving to SC.  However, even if we were <br/>\nstill in Georgia, I wouldn&#39;t worry about the testing.  Georgia law <br/>\nstates that kids have to be tested, but no where in the law does it <br/>\nsay those scores have to be shown to anyone.  Even if the school <br/>\nboard comes to my door asking for them, I don&#39;t have to show them.  <br/>\nThe law is on my side in this one.  So step one in battling this fear <br/>\nis to know your state&#39;s law.  If Washington is like Georgia, then <br/>\nyour son can take that test and you can file the results away in the <br/>\nunopened envelope, and that will be the absolute end of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I know about Georgia and SC (and is probably true for <br/>\nmany other states), is that the schools are overcrowded and the <br/>\nspecial ed department is stretched thin.  Regular classroom teachers <br/>\ndread mainstreamed special ed students, due to the extra paperwork <br/>\ninvolved as well as the classroom management and instructional <br/>\nmodification issues.  In other words, they can&#39;t see past my son&#39;s <br/>\nlabel into what a truly fabulous kid he is, and they don&#39;t really <br/>\nwant him in their schools.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to the conclusion that unless there are custody issues, <br/>\nor some freak neighbor decides to file a report with DFACS, DSS, CPS <br/>\nor whatever a particular state calls it, the state and the school <br/>\nboard are pretty much going to stay out of my business.  They are way <br/>\nto busy, and I am just one little person who is too insignificant to <br/>\neven show up on their radar (even if my son was previously in the <br/>\nsystem).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads me to a question:  Are you concerned that the school <br/>\nsystem might make you send your kids to school, or are you concerned <br/>\nthat your son is not making as much progress as you think he should <br/>\nbe making?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already addressed the former.  As for the latter, you have a <br/>\nspecial boy.  Less than 1/3 of the children on the autism spectrum <br/>\ncan speak, and that figure includes high functioning autism and <br/>\nAsperger&#39;s.  Every day, I am thankful that Trevor learned to <br/>\ncommunicate, even if the right words don&#39;t always come at the right <br/>\ntime for him.  There is no deadline for him to learn what he needs to <br/>\nlearn.  I&#39;ve learned to appreciate the little things that I take for <br/>\ngranted in my other two children.  Like the first time Trevor told a <br/>\nlie - I could have jumped for joy (actually my dh and I both did a <br/>\nlittle victory dance once Trevor left the room).  Or when he used a <br/>\nslang expression in the correct context.  My point is, I don&#39;t <br/>\nmeasure Trevor&#39;s progress in terms of math and reading, or those <br/>\nother things on the standardized tests.  Instead, I measure his <br/>\nprogress just like I did when he was a baby, in terms of what he can <br/>\ndo today that he couldn&#39;t do yesterday, and I always try to keep in <br/>\nmind that some progress can&#39;t be seen or measured at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kasey Frazier&quot; <br/>\n&lt;Fraziermk@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So it is that time of year again here in Washington state for the<br/>\n&gt; annual testing of kids 8yrs and older.
