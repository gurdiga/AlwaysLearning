What&#39;s more, this team of British researchers alleges, that&#39;s in part the fault of video games, which increasingly occupy what little time&#39;s left (and presumably more of what&#39;s available on weekends).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, perhaps the problem isn&#39;t the video games then, but the schools keeping kids indoors all day long?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it fascinating how video games can be both terrible for health and great for health. Articles like these are similar to those vilifying TV - they take some limited information from a study and extrapolate conclusions that don&#39;t necessarily follow. Or they conflate correlation and causation. It&#39;s not at all true that video games cause rickets. Video games are but one of thousands of indoor activities that do not provide for natural sunlight exposure, a deficiency of which causes rickets. An article could just as well be written that says school causes rickets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I&#39;d chime in from lurkdom to point out that the articles, documentaries, media reports, etc. that constantly tell us we&#39;re going to die or damage our kids if we do XYZ or don&#39;t do XYZ... well, it&#39;s not that simple and not black and white.
