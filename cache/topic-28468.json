All children&#39;s brains develop differently. That&#39;s the great thing about homeschooling. Your kids will &quot;get it&quot; when they are ready. I know it&#39;s scary sometimes, all of us have insecurities sometimes.  But if you have love, hugs, daily &quot;I love you&#39;s&quot;, EVERYTHING will fall into place!  Someone is always going to look at you, and want to give their judgement. Remember, YOU are your own worst saboteur. So don&#39;t worry, everything will be allright. My son is almost 8, and he can&#39;t read either, so what? He&#39;s the most loving, intelligent, and honest person I&#39;ve ever known in my life! (by the way, his sister who&#39;s 10, learned to read at 5 yrs. go figure :0)) P.S have you read any of the Moore&#39;s books. I like the information they give about the way our brains take in information. They make alot of sense to me. They advocate not even letting your children read to at least 8 years old.(<br/>\n for boys they say up to 11) and these people were teachers. Also, read Holt, he&#39;s awesome!  good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Tina Bragdon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jamesandtina942@...\">jamesandtina942@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, April 23, 2007 9:23:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] on being &quot;behind&quot;...thoughts/perspective anyone...<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, we are working on updating our wills, and this is what brought my <br/>\nquestions up of all things.

Are you confusing what schools  <br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; with what kids &quot;learn?&quot; Probably more than half of first  <br/>\ngraders don&#39;t read yet - or can sound out words but not comprehend  <br/>\nwhat they are reading. Most use extremely inventive spelling, even  <br/>\nfor three-letter words. Here is something I saw in a 1st grade  <br/>\nclassroom - in the front of the room was a big poster board and the  <br/>\nteacher had written a lot of words on it - the words were: &quot;the&quot; &quot;I&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;me&quot; &quot;it&quot; &quot;was&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;an&quot; &quot;and&quot; and so on. A lot of small  <br/>\nwords. This poster was clearly kept in the front of the room all the  <br/>\ntime. The children were writing an invitation to their parents to  <br/>\ncome to open house at the school. When they wanted to know how to  <br/>\nwrite a word, they asked which word it was on the poster in front of  <br/>\nthe room and they copied it. If the word wasn&#39;t on the poster  <br/>\nalready, the teacher wrote it on another one. The kids asked how to  <br/>\nwrite: &quot;dear&quot; &quot;mommy&quot; &quot;daddy&quot; &quot;please&quot; &quot;come&quot; &quot;open&quot; &quot;house&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;from.&quot; The teacher suggested that, instead of writing &quot;from,&quot; the  <br/>\nkids should write either, &quot;Yours truly,&quot; or &quot;Sincerely.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - somebody reading the invitations might think all those kids  <br/>\ncould read and write, but few of them could have done it on their  <br/>\nown. They made up what they wanted to say, but copied each word.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I think you think that the school kids can do way more than  <br/>\nthey really can do and that your kids would be made to feel stupid or  <br/>\nbe miserable due to being so behind. I doubt that is true. From years  <br/>\nof seeing what happened when unschooled kids did, for some reason,  <br/>\nhave to go to school, they were able to catch up on things like not  <br/>\nknowing multiplication tables, etc. I mean, any kid can be unlucky  <br/>\nand get a mean-spirited teacher who makes the child miserable and  <br/>\nmight focus on the things the child doesn&#39;t yet know - but that is a  <br/>\nhazard of schooling, not a result of having been unschooled - I mean  <br/>\n- it happens to schooled kids, too, when they get a new teacher. In  <br/>\nyour kids&#39; cases, most kind-hearted teachers would be making huge  <br/>\nallowances for them anyway, given the circumstances of them entering  <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;d feel better if you talked to your sil and told her your  <br/>\nconcerns and asked that, should the need arise, she be really sure  <br/>\nthat your kids are with really kind and gentle teachers and that she  <br/>\ntalk to them about making allowances for the fact that they were on a  <br/>\nreally different educational plan that believed in delaying  <br/>\nacademics. That&#39;s not an unknown position among educators - they  <br/>\noften have heard of and somewhat understand the concept, even if they  <br/>\naren&#39;t allowed to practice it. Maybe you could even leave a document  <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve written, explaining what the kids&#39; education has been  <br/>\nlike, to be given to possible teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126518448,"authorName":"C Johnson","from":"C Johnson &lt;piscesmomx3@...&gt;","profile":"piscesmomx3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] on being &quot;behind&quot;...thoughts/perspective anyone...","postDate":"1177346317","msgId":28469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0Njg1Ni40NDk3NS5xbUB3ZWIzMzUwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGYwaW1pNys4dnZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28468,"nextInTopic":28470,"prevInTime":28468,"nextInTime":28470,"topicId":28468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my husband passed away last year, I knew school was the last thing my children needed.

Yet, I know that in thinking of them <br/>\nin &quot;schoolish&quot; terms, that they are &quot;behind&quot;. Dd has grown leaps and <br/>\nbounds exploring reading, yet in a grade one class she would be quite <br/>\nbehind, same in her mathematical thinking/abilities or her spelling.  <br/>\nDs has a pretty major speech delay (we after MUCH agonizing on my <br/>\npart are getting him evaluated...I am hoping to find someone who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t view him as a pathology and can give me some ideas to work <br/>\nwith him) and is almost unintelligable to <br/>\npeople who don&#39;t know him well, plus has some gross motor issues with <br/>\nbalance/perception of even small heights like a step.  Socially, dd <br/>\nprobably would be <br/>\nlabelled with Sensory Integration Disorder, gets very overwhelmed and <br/>\nspaced out/spinning out in <br/>\nlarge groups, and would be one lost and angry little girl in a <br/>\nclassroom of kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our unschooling world, this is all maybe &quot;fine&quot; as I know they are <br/>\ngrowing at a pace right for them and have faith they will continue to <br/>\ngrow because I see their zest for life and learning and I KNOW they <br/>\nlearn through following what is interesting to them with me <br/>\nfacilitating/helping them, but what about in case of the fact they <br/>\nhave to be sent to school?  It is just a thought that haunts me, not <br/>\nthat I would be aware of any of this beyond the grave or anything, <br/>\nbut I can just see people shaking their heads and saying &quot;poor kid, <br/>\nshe can&#39;t even spell more than 3 letter words at 7 yrs old, her mom <br/>\njust didn&#39;t do a thing with her! LOL!  It&#39;s a schooly aspect of my <br/>\nthinking I cannot get out of my mind right now, actually to the point <br/>\nI am getting a little scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts on this anyone from an unschooling perspective? <br/>\n<br/>\nTina, dp James, dd Stephanie (almost 7) and ds Jonathan (almost 4) <br/>\nhere in Manitoba Canada</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28495,"nextTopicId":28416}}
