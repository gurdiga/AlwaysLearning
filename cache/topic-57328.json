I can naturally tune into<br/>\nchoices when I pay attention to my feelings rather than thinking and talking<br/>\nin rote ways about guilt or what I &quot;should&quot; do or be. Tuning into feelings<br/>\nisn&#39;t something I do automatically, and now that I am consciously doing<br/>\nthat, the need for formulaic ideas about what to do is superfluous.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really isn&#39;t trust so much as mindfulness. That&#39;s different than trusting<br/>\nin something nebulous.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrast that with habitual behavior: Does a dog improve when someone says<br/>\n&quot;bad dog?&quot; Do we interact with the dog in a way that inspires change or are<br/>\nwe simply &quot;training&quot; ourselves as we &quot;train&quot; the dog. I don&#39;t think anything<br/>\nchange-worthy happens. That can be a mostly unconscious thoughtless<br/>\ninteraction every time. And one can &quot;try very hard&quot; and get nowhere. When<br/>\nthe dog behaves again in similar ways, someone just gets another chance to<br/>\nsay &quot;bad dog.&quot; Again. It&#39;s easy to do the same thing with ourselves and<br/>\nothers. It puts layers between self and action, between self and our<br/>\nchildren (and others). That&#39;s one result of labeling people and actions and<br/>\nthings like that. It&#39;s an avoidance of making actual changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHabitual formulaic repetitive well-rehearsed behavior eventually seems<br/>\n&quot;natural&quot; and easy, like falling off a log. Easy. Changing back to what I<br/>\nwant to do and be can become no longer natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes just a bit of time, a moment, to stop and ask why or to notice<br/>\nhow I feel about my part in something when I hit a wall with others and in<br/>\nmy own thinking (when I find myself being repetitive). Each one of those<br/>\nmoments can add up to lots of change over time in the way I behave.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Sep 17, 2010 at 4:49 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-As moms who are unschooling - we need to drop the self talk all<br/>\n&gt; together (since either way we just find ourselves creating problems)<br/>\n&gt; and relax and TRUST.... -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree.<br/>\n&gt; Calling it &quot;self talk&quot; isn&#39;t helpful, but suggesting that people<br/>\n&gt; should stop weighing their decisions, or stop considering their<br/>\n&gt; choices--that&#39;s not very good advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What would one be trusting in capital letters if one relaxed and<br/>\n&gt; trusted?

(Sorry I wish I could  <br/>\nfind it but I can&#39;t even remember enough to Google.

He and other parents know  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t doing great. And there&#39;s a feeling everyone else is doing  <br/>\nbetter. But because they don&#39;t know how to do better, don&#39;t know  <br/>\nanything other than &quot;trying harder&quot;, they have this guilt building up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a documentary of other muddling along parents would do is allow  <br/>\nhim to say &quot;Well, at least I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m doing just as  <br/>\npoorly as most everyone else.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s not a personal  <br/>\nfailure but a problem that baffles most everyone so it&#39;s okay if your  <br/>\nparenting is at the level of not sucking as bad as the parents down  <br/>\nthe street with the pregnant teen, or the family with the son who&#39;s  <br/>\nbeen arrested *again*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for mainstream parents it isn&#39;t possible to do better because  <br/>\nthey have a goal labeled &quot;Good Parenting&quot; that&#39;s really a vague  <br/>\ncollection of subgoals they don&#39;t realize that they need to clarify.  <br/>\nAnd the tools for &quot;Good Parenting&quot; require them to sacrifice one  <br/>\nsubgoal for another and the subgoals don&#39;t all head in the same  <br/>\ndirection anyway, so &quot;Good Parenting&quot; can&#39;t get anywhere except by  <br/>\nluck of genes and personalities that happen to be compatible with the  <br/>\nparents&#39; tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople want those who are seemingly doing radical unschooling  <br/>\neffortlessly to say, &quot;Yes, I screw up too,&quot; to ease their guilt so  <br/>\nthey can use the energy they poured into the guilt to keep on keeping  <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuilt is good for stopping people from repeating the same mistake.  <br/>\nGuilt won&#39;t help people *do* better, though. Nor will lack of guilt.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s wanting something better and clarity about what you want. It&#39;s  <br/>\nknowledge about how you can get there and what it will cost. It&#39;s  <br/>\nworking at a problem to find clarity. It&#39;s asking for help to clarify  <br/>\nand get ideas. It&#39;s trying ideas. It&#39;s thinking about what worked or  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t and why to get more clarity and then working at it some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA shift in parenting won&#39;t just happen. What people see in posts from  <br/>\nlong time posters isn&#39;t effortless understanding but the culmination  <br/>\nof thousands of hours of doing (eg, *trying* ideas some of which  <br/>\nsucceed and some of which fail), thinking,  doing, asking, doing,  <br/>\ndiscussing, doing, and reading. There isn&#39;t a short cut. It takes  <br/>\ndedicated focus on the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully some of the experience passed on from long time posters will  <br/>\nhelp newer people avoid some of the really wrong turnings we all  <br/>\nstumbled through but no one can hand anyone understanding.
