Here I was,<br/>\nunschooling, but *always* living under the assumption that of course college<br/>\nshould really be encouraged, if not required.  So while I was mostly happy<br/>\nwith how things were going with unschooling, always at the back of my head,<br/>\nI had that little voice wondering how whatever my kids were going to be<br/>\ninterested in would read on a college application.  It was like I was<br/>\nviewing unschooling as an alternate route to the same ultimate destination:<br/>\ncollege.  Hey, being unschooled would really make my kids stand out on their<br/>\napplications!  (My kids are 7, for cryin&#39; out loud!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a very competitive academic environment, went to a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\nschool, got my M.A. but what am I doing now?  Following my passion: hanging<br/>\nwith my kids, gardening, and taking care of our house and sheep and<br/>\nchickens.  Did I need an M.A. for that?  Absolutely not.  But I&#39;m still so<br/>\nstuck on academic achievement that my degrees somehow make me feel like I&#39;m<br/>\nnot a failure--to feminism, to my parents and grandparents, to my friends<br/>\nwith &quot;real jobs.&quot;  Yes, I&#39;m a stay-at-home mom, but I have an M.A. dammit!<br/>\n I STILL, at 37, ask people where they went to school, as if that&#39;s somehow<br/>\nreflective of who they are as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, when it finally dawned on me that my kids might go to college, or<br/>\nthey might not (and if they want to go because they&#39;re excited about digging<br/>\ninto a particular subject in an academic way, they&#39;ll do whatever they need<br/>\nto do to make it happen), it was such a revelation.  Almost a total paradigm<br/>\nshift.  And it allowed me to stop looking for the academic skills being<br/>\nacquired while playing video games or LEGOs.  It allowed me to really trust<br/>\nthat they will learn whatever they need to learn in order to do what they<br/>\nwant to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so funny--it was one of those realizations that now, in hindsight,<br/>\nseems so obvious.  Like, how could I even say I was unschooling when I was<br/>\nso obviously hampered by this attachment to a college degree?  How could I<br/>\nhave read all that I have about unschooling without understanding that<br/>\nessential point?  (I know the answer to this one, actually, and it&#39;s a<br/>\nfundamental principle of unschooling:  learning *has* to come from within,<br/>\nand until you&#39;re *ready* to understand something, no amount of teaching,<br/>\nreading, etc., can get the point across.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that I&#39;m free of that, I&#39;m free to see ALL learning as important (and<br/>\nfun!)--not just the stuff we learned (or didn&#39;t) in school.  I no longer<br/>\nworry that all my kids want to do is play.  I mean, how awesome is that?<br/>\n They get to PLAY!  ALL DAY!  They are SO EXCITED about what they&#39;re doing<br/>\nin Minecraft that they can&#39;t stop talking about it to anybody who will<br/>\nlisten.  Can you imagine a kid coming home from school and enthusiastically<br/>\ngoing on and on about something they did at school that day?  I know it<br/>\nhappens, but not to every kid, and not every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause nothing my kids are interested in is treated as being more or less<br/>\nimportant than any other thing, it means that everything is fodder for<br/>\nlearning and excitement, whether it&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember Sandra writing recently that if kids are interested, they&#39;re<br/>\nlearning.  I repeat that to myself, almost as a mantra.

One of the ideas which slowed down the adoption of putting bigger spaces in between words was that it made reading much, much easier. Reading was *expected* to be difficult, the difficulty became valued as one of the things which set the literate apart from the unlettered masses - and so making reading easier wasn&#39;t a priority and may even have been an anti-priority for some scholars. (Making reading easier became a priority first in places like Ireland where the vernacular wasn&#39;t anything like Latin - learning a new language was hard enough to make some modifications sensible.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made word spacing take off in a big way all across Europe seems to be a change in what people were writing about - when people were mostly reading the same old thing or variations on those themes, it made sense to keep reading difficult. But when new topics came up and people wanted to read them, to Learn New Things, then making reading itself simpler became valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an intriguing parallel there between the way people think about learning nowadays and what&#39;s learned in schools. The idea that academic learning *should* be difficult hasn&#39;t gone away - it was challenged back in the 70s with the open classroom movement, but the idea has stuck pretty tenaciously and may be one of the reasons school reform failed. There&#39;s such a longstanding expectation that learning should be difficult that most parents value the difficulty over what&#39;s being learned - the flip side of that being that not much of substance is ever presented in schools. It doesn&#39;t need to be so long as &quot;the basics&quot; are kept uselessly opaque. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Gorillas...was...Re: I&#39;m right there with you","postDate":"1315161800","msgId":62769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0MGdzOCtzYWJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGozdTI2YStyNm85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62768,"nextInTopic":62770,"prevInTime":62768,"nextInTime":62770,"topicId":62730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I forgot, I had a few ideas about gorilla themed things too-- Schleich and Safari are two toy companies that make realistic plastic animal figures.

Both were hung up on the fact that their kids were happiest doing what they wanted to do: play, and weren&#39;t taking any &quot;initiative&quot; to do the &quot;hard stuff&quot;: reading, writing and math.  Both moms decided that it was time to crack the whip, they&#39;d let their kids play long enough, and they were going to start requiring a bit of &quot;work&quot; since it wasn&#39;t happening on its own. Truth is, it was happening, but the moms weren&#39;t seeing it. Reading and math in video games--so what, they said, it Doesn&#39;t count, not &quot;academic&quot; enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept digging in both conversations and got to what I think the heart of the issue was, which is twofold. One the one hand, neither saw play as productive because it is too enjoyable--learning is hard, they believe, so fun and learning aren&#39;t compatible :( and the other point, which really surprised me, was both moms think their kids will eventually need to go back to school if they&#39;re to be successful.  So here they are, playing the unschooling game, all the while planning on sending the kids to school when they&#39;re a bit older, which is leading to feeling that their kids need to be kept on-level with schooled kids..... What???!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if any of that is going on with you, but the similarities in the conversations are so striking that I wondered if there is less conviction among unschooling parents of young ones as I had thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I completely agree with the sentiments in the other thread about NOT demonizing schools, I also don&#39;t see how one could possibly unschool successfully if the potential of a perceived NEED (in an academic sense) for school casts shadows the the horizon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m right there with you","postDate":"1315155341","msgId":62766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdFMTIzNDZGLTQ4RTMtNEQwRC1CMjEzLUNFNDNGMkY0Mzg4QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0MDRvMys4cWFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo0MDRvMys4cWFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62765,"nextInTopic":62767,"prevInTime":62765,"nextInTime":62767,"topicId":62730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I have a seven year old son and we are just beginning unschooling this fall after a failed attempt at curriculum the last part of the school year previous.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-938278926\">-=-I have a seven year old son and we are just beginning unschooling this fall after a failed attempt at curriculum the last part of the school year previous.

On the way home she said, &quot;Mom, is 1+1+1 three?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I was new to the idea of unschooling, I was worried about how she would learn math.  That day I saw that math was all around, and natural, interesting and fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t come up with the idea she wanted to learn math that day.

I try to do the trust thing and wait for him to come up with things he wants to learn but it doesn&#39;t seem enough somehow. He loves animals so we have ended up with a hermit crab, two mice, and a frog that ran away. We did the butterfly grow kit and that was fun for him while it lasted but he seems to lose interest in anything rather quickly. The fear of him getting everything he needs to have the life he may eventually want keeps me frustrated and I know as we&#39;re unscholimg I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about it but I do. For a while he liked me to read to him so i was encouraged about that but he didn&#39;t find the books interesting enough. He loves gorillas and the concept of the freedom they have to live in the woods so we&#39;ve done some film watching of primates but short of the zoo, what else do I do for him with that? I don&#39;t mean to go on I&#39;m just frustrated that all he wants to do is play. How do I know he&#39;s really gonna take an interest some day in things he hates now like math and reading?

What he did was the same  <br/>\nas a child banging on pots with enthusiasm, completing a jigsaw  <br/>\npuzzle, pouring a glass of juice without spilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important to unschooling is to support the kids&#39; interests and  <br/>\nnot judging those interests by adult standards. They are learning  <br/>\nabout the world whether it be through something that&#39;s relevant to  <br/>\nadult life or is only relevant (in adult eyes!) to the right now life  <br/>\nof your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important to unschooling is swirling new things through their  <br/>\nlives. You don&#39;t need to swirl clock kits through their lives ;-)  <br/>\n(unless someone has shown a passion for putting kits together). But  <br/>\ntry mixing up their days so there are new things for them to encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut make it about providing what they need, not about creating some  <br/>\nideal unschooling life. Keep your eyes on them, not on other people&#39;s  <br/>\nlives and kids. (So, yes, too much comparison.) Right now there might  <br/>\nbe something they need and want from stability and predictability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my oldest wants to be a fashion designer and someone gave her a  <br/>\n&gt; machine. she has made a couple of things on it but now it&#39;s not  <br/>\n&gt; used. they don&#39;t seem to be interested in much for long and i get  <br/>\n&gt; nervous when i hear of other children swimming 100 lengths of a  <br/>\n&gt; swimming pool or some other amazing feat. too much comparison?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two things: Some people are like that moving from one interest to  <br/>\nanother, being jacks of all trades :-) Some ages are like that. Some  <br/>\ninterests are like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people enjoy the camaraderie of doing things together. So your  <br/>\nexpectation that exploring an interest means doing things on her own  <br/>\nmay be totally unrealistic. My daughter&#39;s very much a doing things  <br/>\ntogether person. Me too, actually. I loved watching my father fix  <br/>\nthings but mostly when I tried on my own I&#39;d lose interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are way more connections with fashion designing than just  <br/>\nsewing! Drawing. History of. Museum displays. Mysteries about.  <br/>\nSeamless pattern design for fabrics. But, again, focus on her rather  <br/>\nthan your idea of what &quot;being a fashion designer&quot; means. Don&#39;t try to  <br/>\ndirect her so much as create an environment where she can explore  <br/>\n(with you if she needs to, or with others who enjoy it) the fullness  <br/>\nof her interests. Find what she likes (about what she&#39;s labeling  <br/>\n&quot;fashion design&quot; and help her explore it and expand on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"getting stuck","postDate":"1315041198","msgId":62730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozc3IzZStraWMyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62738,"prevInTime":62729,"nextInTime":62731,"topicId":62730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hello, i feel like i should be more comfortable than i am right now.  i have a dd5, ds7 and a dd10.  we have never had a curriculum.  i know the panic monster","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2091493706\">hello,<br/>\ni feel like i should be more comfortable than i am right now.  i have a dd5, ds7 and a dd10.  we have never had a curriculum.  i know the panic monster hits everyone from time to time but mine lingers a lot at the moment.  am i giving them enough? how do you know? i am again reading a lot on here and have just read some typical unschooling days but sometimes they unnerve me.  one mentioned a child making his own clocks at 8.  oh my!  <br/>\nyesterday we chilled and chatted and then walked to town where we browsed and chatted and they ordered their own smoothies in the smoothie shop (which my oldest was so proud to take me too because it&#39;s her best chill out place with her friends).  we had had a lovely open chat that morning about all things growing up and for 10 wow! she has some amazing insights into life and is very self assured :-) when we got home the two other children made traps with wool all through the house and garden.  and pulled a small bin up and down from a window with bits and bobs in.<br/>\nwe watched some tv and then took a neighbour&#39;s dog for walk and played on the park for a while and then came home and watched &quot;daddy day care&quot;. i don&#39;t want to look for the learning below the surface per se. i know enough to know they will get what they need from each day but it doesn&#39;t feel like enough.  i feel like i am being lazy if this is all we do (some days we do more).  like how will they or me ever fit into society ie. when they get jobs or when i may have to get work outside the home.  i feel lazy and carefree and get this feeling it&#39;s wrong.  i am there for them all day, to help and chat and be when they need me....<br/>\nmy oldest wants to be a fashion designer and someone gave her a machine.  she has made a couple of things on it but now it&#39;s not used. they don&#39;t seem to be interested in much for long and i get nervous when i hear of other children swimming 100 lengths of a swimming pool or some other amazing feat.  too much comparison?<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62791,"nextTopicId":62801}}
