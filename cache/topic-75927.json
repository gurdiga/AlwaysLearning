What&#39;s important to my mind is what it means in your mind when you use the phrase. Sandra and Alex are pointing out that it has a connotation of scarcity and then over-abundance.

In the meantime, rather than reading everything you can get your hands on, read the most relevant things to what you&#39;re stuck on right now - what is getting in the way of you making better unschooling choices.

If I can&#39;t help, I offer to tell them how they can do it themselves so they can get it sooner than they would if they waited, or I ask a nearby sibling if they can help (of course it&#39;s cool if they say no -on the whole they say yes, I find).

What they&#39;re learning from). And it takes letting go of the idea of a co-operative family where children help out a lot being your goal. Your goals should be your children having enough time to do the things they love and changing your own thinking so that helping them get that is a joyful thing for you as their mum. These are principles which you can use in each moment to help you make a better unschooling response.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"font-size:75%;color:#575757;\">Sent from Samsung Mobile</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling Large Families","postDate":"1433553653","msgId":75956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyMTA3Qzk0LTM2QUQtNDMzQS04OUNDLUYxRjMwQjE4NDYxRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG1rdGN0NisxdG4yNWkyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":75955,"nextInTopic":75957,"prevInTime":75955,"nextInTime":75957,"topicId":75927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I was actually reading How to Talk so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk.

I&#39;ve been trying so hard to do the *right* thing, but it seems like I keep getting it *wrong*. I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time reading up on gentle parenting and unschooling. I finished Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site, am about halfway through Sandra&#39;s site (alphabetically along with most of the links at the bottom), and have purchased and read every unschooling book I could get my hands on. My oldest is almost 22, so I&#39;ve been parenting traditionally for a long time. It&#39;s going to take a little while for me to transition, but the important thing is that I really want this for my children and am determined to make it work.</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">***</span><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">What happened before you lifted limits?&nbsp; Were there spills before unschooling?&nbsp; What did you do about them?&nbsp; What has changed?&nbsp; Why has it gotten so challenging that you feel that there is no longer any time to do all those fun things you first listed above?***</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">Yes, there were spills, but the kids had to clean their own messes (unless they were too little). And it has gotten challenging because it really is a lot of work for one person. Before we started unschooling principles, I would straighten up in the morning and do some laundry, the kids and I would do whatever we had planned (or not planned) for the day, I would make lunch at 12 and tell them what we were having. If they didn&#39;t like it, they were free to have something else, but if I needed to make it, they would have to let me know while I was already in the kitchen. Then at 1 we would all work together at whatever household tasks were ours and clean up so that my husband would come home to a half-decent house. This usually took around 15 minutes- 30 minutes at the most.</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">Now, it&#39;s a bit different. Since we don&#39;t have our 1:00 cleanup time, I try to keep the house up throughout the day by myself. It&#39;s a big difference going from around 9 people working together to 1. Not having a set lunchtime also really throws things off. Here&#39;s an example of what happens here now:</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">Ireland: Mommy, can you make me ramen?</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1673709230Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">Me: Yes.

Our subconsciousness can express itself without our conscious mind hearing or seeing it.  Our super-ego can insert messages from long-dead relatives (maybe even a couple of generations back if they were quoted by our parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know from the scripted conversations around us that it&#39;s possible to &quot;communicate&quot; without really thinking or listening (to ourselves or the other person).  <br/>\nHi!

The only butts I ever signed on to wipe were my children&#39;s.  They are a limited set of three humans, whose lives have been shared generously by them, to help other kids&#39; lives be better.  There are dozens (hundreds over the years) of families whose lives have been laid out for other unschoolers to see.  Not everyone can, should, will or needs to do that, but those who are able and willing to share make a profound difference for every family affected by ANY change in either parent who meets them, reads about them, hears them speak.   None of them want to parent other parents.  They want to help other intelligent adults become kinder and more open parents to their own children—parents who don&#39;t belittle their children with ill-chosen (or unchosen) words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny time you don&#39;t think of two things and choose the better one, you have acted thoughtlessly.<br/>\nEach time you speak, or write, without thinking what the best words and phrases will be for the situation (speaking to children, writing here, thanking a partner) you&#39;ve spoken thoughtlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will not inspect anyone&#39;s home.  There&#39;s no report to file, no test to take.  This will be between you and your families.  <br/>\nBut advice given here, or questions or comments, are all put on the table under the bright light of unschooling.

My standards have never been ultra high because with 10 kids it would be impossible to have a Better Homes and Garden-style house. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been having trouble even keeping the house up to those standards, which basically consist of enough clean dishes for the next couple of hours, enough clean clothes for at least that day (it&#39;s harder than you may think), and no garbage or food thrown around. The one thing I did ask my 10, 9, and 7 yr. olds is if they could try to have a path cleared through their room so that their dad doesn&#39;t kill himself in the morning trying to walk through to get to the upstairs bathroom.

I&#39;ve recently stopped rationing the snacks, although it&#39;s been very expensive because my kids can easily finish off several bags or boxes of snacks in just a few hours. Last week my grocery bill was $503 for a week&#39;s worth of groceries. The milk is also an issue because they can easily go through 2 gallons of milk per day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span><br></span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\">Unschooling does not mean going bankrupt. There is no way I could maintain a $500 a week grocery bill for a long period of time. What I do is I buy what we need for meals. I ask for input on our menu, then I create a list. Then I leave the list out on the counter for the kids to add to. If I have extra or less money that week I will let the kids know. I also buy snacks for each kid. 3 of my kids do not snack a lot 2 of them do. What would happen is the 2 would eat all the snacks and there <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_7792\">wouldn&#39;t</span></span> be any for the other 3. I would set aside snacks for the 3 and add them back to the pile when I shopped again. (I have a snack tub in the cabinet that can be taken from at anytime.) That way they would have it if they wanted it. As the kids get older it is easier to allow for them to have their very own set of snacks. For my older teens I gave them a snack box for under their bed. I also do not make things equal. I think that is what makes it hard to have a large family. For example if 1 son needs new shoes I do not buy a new pair of shoes for everyone. Same goes for food. I pay close attention that everyone gets what they want and what I can afford. 2 of my kids love to bake. I buy sugar and flour in bulk and let them bake. That <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-2\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_7966\">generates</span></span> a lot of snacks for everyone to enjoy for minimal cost.&nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15.8599996566772px;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_7548\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My next question has to do with house keeping.

First off lower your standards for a while. I refused to ask my kids for help for a long time. I did everything by myself. After a while I began to feel abused by my family. I really felt left out because there is a lot of work to do just to keep the family fed and enough clean plates to eat off of. &nbsp;I pulled my oldest aside and talked with him about how I was feeling. He wanted our family to be radical unschoolers. He offered to help me out. I think the key is he wanted to help. We wanted to learn together. For a while it was he and I who took care of all the household needs. Then I began to ask the other kids for help. It was hard when they would so no. I would take a deep breath and do it myself, ask someone else or let it go. For what seemed like a REALLY LONG TIME my kids said no. During this time I kept telling myself my kids did not ask to be born. They and their upkeep are my <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span>responsibility</span></span>. Now 99% of the time when I ask for help they help. A lot of the time they offer help. Also for me I accepted the help they were willing to give. For example in the past if I asked my kids to clean their room I expected it to be cleaned to my standards, which are quite high. When I would ask them to clean their room and all they did was take out dirty clothes, glasses and garbage I accepted that as clean. I also look at each <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-6\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8176\">child&#39;s</span></span> <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-7\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8224\">personality</span></span>. My daughter loves her stuff. Where I see clutter she sees beauty. I embrace that now. She has stuff all over her walls. When I sit in there I look around and see all her friends and memories and love. Another example when one of my sons decided to take over his laundry he asked for 2 baskets. He keeps clean clothes in one and dirty in the other. I have always been laundry folder but the laundry would get behind a lot. His clothes are cleaned weekly by him and he always knows where his stuff is. I have accepted that he will not be hanging or folding his clothes and that is <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-5\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span>OK</span></span>. Now I have 3 kids doing their own laundry so I rarely get behind on that chore anymore.&nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_5390\" dir=\"ltr\">The <span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673misspell-3\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-800003673yui_3_16_0_1_1433173708173_8548\">transition</span></span> to radical homeschooling was bumpy for us and it was very much well worth it.

After about 6 months of unschooling, however, I really opened up to the idea of principles instead of rules and read everything I could find on the subject.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Sometime in January, I slowly started transitioning, beginning with saying &quot;yes&quot; more, then doing away with bed times, and letting go of food restrictions. These changes were easy to implement. Our nights are much more peaceful without the arguments over staying in bed. What was once &quot;bedtime&quot; now usually consists of playing games, the kids making paper sculptures, and then falling asleep in the living room while watching &quot;Hercules- the Legendary Journey.&quot;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>The food principles were also pretty easy since I grew up being allowed to eat whatever I wanted because I didn&#39;t like my mom&#39;s cooking. :) I&#39;ve always been flexible in what my kids eat, although I did try to ration the snacks and milk for financial reasons. I&#39;ve recently stopped rationing the snacks, although it&#39;s been very expensive because my kids can easily finish off several bags or boxes of snacks in just a few hours. Last week my grocery bill was $503 for a week&#39;s worth of groceries. The milk is also an issue because they can easily go through 2 gallons of milk per day.</p><p><br></p><p>Which leads me to my first actual question: Does anyone have advice on how to keep the food bill down? Twelve people being supported by a welder&#39;s income can make things pretty tight, so there&#39;s no way I can afford $500 grocery bills every week.</p><p><br></p><p>My next question has to do with house keeping. Eliminating chores is the most recent transition we&#39;ve made, and I&#39;ve got to admit, I&#39;m EXHAUSTED. I understand that it&#39;s all a choice, but 12 people can make a bit of a mess. I actually do enjoy cleaning, but sometimes it seems neverending. This morning I woke up to a dining room filled with scraps of paper (not a problem), spilled drinks, melted freeze pops, and ramen all over the floor (all a problem, in my book). As I cleaned the dining room, the kids went out to the kitchen and spilled cereal everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been happening everyday. Right now I&#39;m reading &quot;How to Talk so Your Kids Will Listen...,&quot; so I decided to try problem solving with them. I explained that they&#39;re probably glad that they have more time to spend on doing what they like to do, and I like to see them happy. I then told them how much I miss doing things with them- painting murals, going to the park, going to the creek to find snakes, etc.- that we don&#39;t have much time to do anymore because I&#39;m always so busy and- honestly, worn-out from- cleaning up spills and food dumped everywhere. I asked them for any suggestions they have so that I could spend less time on these things. I swore I heard birds chirping at the silence that followed. They had no idea what to say. I tried to start it off by suggesting that maybe each person could try to clean up just after themselves, like putting their dishes in the sink or cleaning up any food or drinks they may spill. I also suggested setting the oven timer for 15 minutes everyday so we can work together to do a quick clean-up before their dad comes home. Again, no feedback (other than my 10-yr.-old joking that I could just put them all up for adoption.)</p><p><br></p><p>I would be truly grateful for any advice anyone has- whether you&#39;ve been through this or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks so much.</p><p>Shelly</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75971,"nextTopicId":75973}}
