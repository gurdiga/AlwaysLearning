Some addictions<br/>\nalso have more strong physical elements.  All<br/>\naddiction problems lie within the person and must be<br/>\naddressed there in order for them to move past them<br/>\nand heal.  In my experience, a drug or alcohol addict<br/>\nwho is medically &quot;cured&quot; of their addiction will not<br/>\nbe able to function in a healthy way mentally, and<br/>\nwill return to their addiction, or another like it, or<br/>\nmultiple unhealthy behaviors, without recognizing the<br/>\naddictive mental behaviors and addressing the problem<br/>\nwithin themselves.  Alcoholics like this are referred<br/>\nto as &quot;Dry Drunks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery person has differing biochemistry, and I believe<br/>\nthat science has yet to discover the ways in which an<br/>\nindividual&#39;s chemistry is affected by different<br/>\nchemicals or mental stimuli.  Be that as it may,<br/>\nmental addiction (like Katrina&#39;s friends with the<br/>\nvideo games) can be enough to ruin lives.  There are<br/>\nalso a lot of physical substances that are not BAD in<br/>\nand of themselves, and can be used quite safely in<br/>\nmoderation by SOME people(ie: caffiene, alcohol,<br/>\nadrenaline, sugar) but to others are highly and easily<br/>\naddicting and detrimental to their health.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that TV stimulates some chemical<br/>\nreaction in the brains of those that are addicted to<br/>\nis unhealthily, and that they should avoid it for<br/>\ntheir mental AND physical health, the same way an<br/>\nalcoholic avoids drink.  Maybe not, but who knows for<br/>\nsure?  But you are right, it IS mental (like ALL other<br/>\naddictions) and that part of it is obvious.  Some<br/>\npeople can handle goobs of it unaffectedly, and some<br/>\ncannot.  But I do think each person should decide that<br/>\nfor themselves, and not a parent decide for a child. <br/>\nChildren have to be free to make their own mistakes<br/>\nand learn things their own way, or they are not free<br/>\nto live their own lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!

This is especially true if they have to learn to deal with their personalities for the rest of their lives.  There are many workaholics that come by their habit genetically.
