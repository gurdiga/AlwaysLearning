And I read your blog and was happy for you and your<br/>\nlittle boy that it sounds like he&#39;s having fun with learning in an<br/>\nunpressured way and all. But, you know, it&#39;s not necessarily true that in<br/>\nschool that backward S would have been wrong. Stay with me: He&#39;s not even<br/>\nsix? He would be in Kindergarten. And any teacher worth her salt would have<br/>\ntaken that piece of writing and appreciated it for what it is: A good<br/>\nexample of writing that is developmentally right where it should be. Now,<br/>\nbefore I ruffle any feathers here, let me say what I think the problem is.<br/>\nSee, for one thing, definitely if Rowan were not almost six but, say, almost<br/>\nten, or probably even at almost 8 and in the 2nd grade, then that backwards<br/>\nS would be  pointed out as an error and corrected. And more to the point, in<br/>\nmy mind, whether that was wrong or not would have nothing to do with where<br/>\nthat child was individually in the development of his writing skills - No,<br/>\nit would be based strictly on that arbitrary scale that teachers are forced<br/>\nto use that says on month 4 of first grade it&#39;s ok for a child to do this,<br/>\nbut not on month 6, for instance. (I&#39;m not making this up, it *is* that<br/>\nridiculous, I know first-hand.) It&#39;s all tied to the insidious requirement<br/>\nof quantifying everything, labeling everything and categorizing everything<br/>\n(or trying to) into neat little slots in the name of making teaching appear<br/>\nto be an exact science, which clearly it is not since it deals with human<br/>\nbeings! So, if Rowan were unfortunate enough to be in school instead of<br/>\nhappily home, it sounds like he might have been OK only right now, and only<br/>\nin that respect, ONLY because at this exact time in his life and in that<br/>\nvery narrow area of learning, sounds like he happens to match the<br/>\nexpectation of what the &quot;average&quot; child does at that exact age (writing a<br/>\nfew words, experimenting with writing, including some reversals).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please babble away :) I enjoyed it more, and for more reasons, than you<br/>\nguessed!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, May 16, 2008 at 7:05 PM, Laureen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:splashing@...\">splashing@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Heya!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am going to blog about this later, with pictures, but I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; take the opportunity to just crow to folks who will get all the<br/>\n&gt; implications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So...
