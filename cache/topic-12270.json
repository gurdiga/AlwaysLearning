I just got home <br/>\nfrom today&#39;s pro-peace rally in NYC where I was joined by about 399,999 or <br/>\nso other folks and uncountable policemen (although I&#39;m sure the City was <br/>\nkeeping track).  It was VERY cold today, and there were a few elderly, <br/>\nunwell folks who had planned to come with us today but decided to <br/>\nparticipate in a vigil closer to home owing to the long hours we&#39;d be out <br/>\nin the elements and the amount of hoofing we had to do.  So, I wonder what <br/>\nthe turnout might have been if the conditions had been just slightly more <br/>\ncomfortable!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were also joined by millions (estimated by the corporate media at around <br/>\n6 million) across the globe.  All these folks are not buying our <br/>\ngovernment&#39;s assertion the way to assuage our fears and *stop* terrorism is <br/>\nraining terror down on the heads of the innocent PEOPLE of Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s rally was way different than the one I attended in D.C. about a <br/>\nmonth ago.  The police were more *involved* shall we say, and there were <br/>\nmany arrests, I understand.  The police were a little frightening sometimes <br/>\nin their riot gear.  One elderly lady who was with my informal group was <br/>\nnot permitted by the police to leave the rally so she could go into a <br/>\nStarbucks, get out of the cold for a few minutes, have a seat, get some <br/>\njava, and go to the bathroom.  She ended up having to climb over a metal <br/>\nbarrier, which she did with the help of some folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that fear is a powerful motivator, but it is also one of the worst <br/>\nreasons to do something (maybe if I weren&#39;t so dog-tired right now, I&#39;d be <br/>\nable to think of worse reasons, so that&#39;s not really scientific).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope you won&#39;t mind my off-topic rambling.  Today was really <br/>\namazing and I wanted to share my experiences with some of my favorite minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSweet dreams, folks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:55 2/15/03 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pressdemocrat.com/coursey/14coursey_b1.html\">http://www.pressdemocrat.com/coursey/14coursey_b1.html</a><br/>\n&gt;© The Press Democrat.

Be very, very afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is brought to you this week by your federal government. <br/>\nWe&#39;re going to war, our leaders tell us. Or war is coming to us. Either <br/>\nway, it&#39;s a dangerous, dangerous time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaghdad has weapons of mass destruction. Pyongyang has missiles that can <br/>\nreach Sonoma County. Agents of al-Qaida are loose in the land, the CIA <br/>\ndirector says. Significant public buildings, bridges or landmarks may be <br/>\ntargets. But so might apartment buildings, hotels, schools or churches. <br/>\nKey industries are asked to look for &quot;infiltrators.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo duck and cover. Tape and seal. Lock and load, batten down the <br/>\nhatches, praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, take a deep breath and think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are we going into full panic mode now? Is the world any more <br/>\nthreatening than it has been since Sept. 11, 2001? And if so, what is <br/>\nmaking it that way?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to dismiss the threat of terrorism. No one needs to be <br/>\nreminded of the damage that a small group of determined people can <br/>\ncause. That threat exists every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what happened to the post-Sept. 11 advice to &quot;live your lives; go <br/>\nabout your business&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, our lives include stocking up on duct tape and our business is <br/>\nto ferret out sleeper agents in the next cubicle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing if you live in Manhattan or D.C., or if you work for <br/>\nLockheed or the National Security Agency. But the fact is, the vast <br/>\nmajority of Americans don&#39;t live or work in those places.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t argue with &quot;be prepared.&quot; It&#39;s good advice for earthquakes, for <br/>\npower outages, for Boy Scouts and for days when you just can&#39;t get to <br/>\nthe store for groceries.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what are we preparing for now? Anthrax? Mustard gas? A radioactive <br/>\n&quot;dirty bomb&quot;? Who is kidding whom? If I can&#39;t keep the moths and mice <br/>\nout of my house, how is a little tape and plastic going to save me from <br/>\nnerve gas or radioactive contamination?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I keep coming back to the same question: Why is my government <br/>\ndeliberately trying to scare me?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve heard from Osama bin Laden. He&#39;s popped <br/>\nup on video and audio tapes several times since Sept. 11, each time <br/>\nfiguratively beating his chest and exhorting his followers to praise <br/>\nAllah and kill the infidels.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut each previous time, our government has downplayed the messages, <br/>\nquestioned their authenticity, warned that broadcasting them might help <br/>\nbin Laden send secret messages to his al-Qaida operatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, though, his message conveniently arrives at a time when it can mesh <br/>\nwell with our government&#39;s own message to its citizens. That being: War <br/>\nin Iraq is imminent. Terrorism is still a threat. And the two are <br/>\nsomehow connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many Americans who don&#39;t think the debate is that simple. But <br/>\nit&#39;s a lot harder for them to argue their point of view when the <br/>\nnational fear factor is ratcheted up to code orange or code red or <br/>\nwhatever color Tom Ridge decides goes with his tie this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s difficult to second-guess these warnings. After all, they may be -- <br/>\nand probably eventually will be -- right. We&#39;re not done with terrorism.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t question the purpose of the alerts. <br/>\nAre they designed simply to cover the butts of the intelligence agencies <br/>\nthat dropped the ball before Sept. 11? Are they distractions to divert <br/>\nthe public debate from other issues? Are they an indication that our <br/>\nleaders know that something terrible is going to happen, and they are <br/>\npowerless to stop it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have the answer. All I know is that my government wants me to be <br/>\nafraid right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that, more than anything else, scares the heck out of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nContact Chris Coursey at 521-5223 or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ccoursey@...\">ccoursey@...</a>.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12286,"nextTopicId":12444}}
