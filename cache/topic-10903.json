This can also be used to damage the undead.<br/>\nThey can detect evil w/in the vicinity at will.  They are immune to all<br/>\ndiseases, including magical diseases.  At second level and up they are<br/>\nimmune to fear and give their teammates +4 against fear.  At second level<br/>\nand up a paladin may smite evil dealing extra damage and increasing<br/>\nprobability to hit once per day.  Beginning at third level, a Paladin can<br/>\nremove disease once per week from anyone they can touch.  Every three levels<br/>\nthereafter, they can do it once more per week.  When a Paladin reaches third<br/>\nlevel, they can turn undead, ie make them turn away and run in fear of a<br/>\nholy symbol.  At fourth level and up a Paladin can cast divine spells.  At<br/>\nfifth level, a cleric gains a special mount, also blessed by the gods and<br/>\nthus gaining more hp and higher intelligence.  A cleric must follow a code<br/>\nof conduct ie remain lawful/good or be expelled as a Paladin and loose all<br/>\nof the above abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t have any info on Sages in his rule books.
