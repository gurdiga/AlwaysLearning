I <br/>\nthough we could do this in the politics folder over at unschooling.info <br/>\nforum so as not to clutter or derail any of the lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I know this movie will be rough, I really want to see it and <br/>\nsupport it. I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s message is ultimately one of hope and <br/>\nfaith in humanity rather than just a grind you into depression kind of <br/>\nthing so I&#39;ve gone ahead and put it on my movie queue, and I may <br/>\npurchase it as well to support this kind of film making.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmnesty International has sent around a teacher&#39;s guide to the movie, <br/>\nwhich while annoying with its learning objectives, etc., does have some <br/>\ngood info and discussion starter questions that could be interesting to <br/>\nthink about. I&#39;d be happy to post the link over there if folks are <br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I thought with the different book discussions on the elists <br/>\nthese days that this might be of interest to other folks, too. Let me <br/>\nknow and I&#39;ll set it up if there&#39;s interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (7), Julia (6), Sam (4.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22047,"nextTopicId":22037}}
