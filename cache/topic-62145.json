Her kids were in and out of various kinds of school and homeschooling, unschooling, Waldorf, charter, private, computer-focus, traditional public school.   The only constant was change.  And looking back and talking to her friend, Holly&#39;s summary to me was that what the mom wanted was for other moms to see her as a busily concerned mom who had researched The Best option of the moment, and would Do ANYthing to provide that for her children.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What she was providing for her children, though, was instability, a panicky, reactive mother who criticized them and the people around them all the time, and acted as though their lives would be RUINED if she didn&#39;t do something NOW!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t be that mom.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t be a jittery tiger-mom of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; Try to find calm and patience and acceptance, and then you&#39;ll find that you can think more clearly and there will be time to be quietly with your kids and you&#39;ll be better able to see what they themselves are interested in, without caring so much what people on blogs or this list THINK they should be interested in.

It was difficult for me to keep up with it. Finally I feel I have a grip on some basics now. Even DS cannot read yet, he has way passed me in big time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is amazing to see DS5 and I have such different learning style. He has built hundreds of structures and torn all of them down since day one when he got his hands on minecraft. For me, I may start with &quot;the history of architecture&quot; and study it for a year before I ever build my first structure. Mine is a typical schoolish linear process of learning. His is through trial and error and learns as he goes. I love his way of learning and I should refrain myself from imposing my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will definitely try to play minecraft once I get things organized. Yes, I would get into those areas myself (architecture, geology). My son&#39;s passion definitely has inspired me. By making that long list (architecture or geology), I may have added my own strong desire of learning too. So instead of making that list for him, I may keep it for myself and I would have more to offer once DS needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJihong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonjour Jihong,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have 2 young minecraft players here.

I haven&#39;t played myself. I have another child who needs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me and interrupts me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you can find time to play with him, get yourself an account, set up a<br/>\n&gt; craft bukkit server and follow his lead to help him build the stuff he<br/>\n&gt; wants. You could learn a lot from it and it&#39;s great fun :-) Craft bukkit<br/>\n&gt; will let you set up a peacefull server with hardly any monster if your son<br/>\n&gt; wants to be able to concentrate on building things and exploring.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I cannot sit with him all the time while I attend to other things. While I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am away, he gets banned from the servers because he doesn&#39;t read and cannot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand what is going on in the server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t let him go to adult servers alone. He will get kicked and banned. He<br/>\n&gt; could be insulted too. Most servers have a lot of role playing going on,<br/>\n&gt; they have building standards... letting your 5 year old play alone on their<br/>\n&gt; servers would be like taking him to the model making room in an architecture<br/>\n&gt; school, armed with scissors and glue and letting him &quot;loose&quot;. People will<br/>\n&gt; get mad and kick him out and its not fair on anybody. If you want to go to<br/>\n&gt; adult servers, go with him, do the chatting for him, help him every step of<br/>\n&gt; the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You need to find servers that are friendly for young kids and will forgive<br/>\n&gt; him doing a little grief. And even there, you probably need to stay close<br/>\n&gt; when he plays multi player. And you might need to help him with the<br/>\n&gt; diplomacy side. Apologise for him if he brakes something by accident, be an<br/>\n&gt; ambassador online for him and help other players understand he is only 5 and<br/>\n&gt; means no harm.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is an yahoo list for unschooling gamers, I have found very friendly<br/>\n&gt; young minecraft friends for my kids there :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another great thing, probably the best, is to setup a server and help his<br/>\n&gt; real life friends setting up their own accounts so they can play together<br/>\n&gt; (you need to discuss that with the other children&#39;s parents of course. That<br/>\n&gt; works best for cousins or if you have friends whose kids are friends with<br/>\n&gt; your child).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Voice chat works nicely for us. My kids both have a gmail account with gtalk<br/>\n&gt; chat enabled. They can contact their friends who also have gmail accounts to<br/>\n&gt; chat with their real life friends. They love voice chatting while playing<br/>\n&gt; minecraft together. It helps them decide what to build, where, and roleplay<br/>\n&gt; in their minecraft world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Woooah! You might need to get realistic and lower your expectations here.<br/>\n&gt; Your son is only 5!

One of<br/>\n&gt; our friend player is developping an &quot;architectural eye&quot;, starting to want<br/>\n&gt; his building to look less bulky and getting interested in design. But he is<br/>\n&gt; 11. All the 5 year old I have seen playing build big bunkers, love blowing<br/>\n&gt; up stuff with TNT and adopting wolves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean if your son is into architecture, by all means support him. But you<br/>\n&gt; might want to pay close attention to what is fun to HIM.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the store, he never wanted to leave.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only he can say what&#39;s too much.

Educating yourself yo you have info available when he asks sounds like<br/>\n&gt; a good idea, discovering stuff together and sharing excitement are very good<br/>\n&gt; way to nurture both the learning and the relationship :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Claire<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430148316,"authorName":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","from":"&quot;whatismyusername@...&quot; &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt;","profile":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Minecraft, strew and support my son&#39;s interest","postDate":"1312352424","msgId":62170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGoxYXBiOCtsODU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUxNDA3MzI2LTJBMzktNDE3Ri04Q0Q1LTM4N0EyQ0RCMzBDRkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":62169,"nextInTopic":62171,"prevInTime":62169,"nextInTime":62171,"topicId":62145,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Robin, spot on!

Years  <br/>\n&gt; gave me a better overall picture of how and what she learned and how  <br/>\n&gt; her personality was evolving. She&#39;s 16, not 16.4 years.

My daughter is almost 6, my son 7 and<br/>\n1/2 :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nInstalling new mods he wants. Especially right at the minute he asked me to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do it. (But I can&#39;t. I really need alone time to do it. Otherwise I cannot<br/>\n&gt; figure out how to do it with disruptions. He often cries because of that)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, mods can be hard to install and sometimes they conflict with each other<br/>\nand everything breaks...  I too can not figure it out if constantly<br/>\ninterrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sit with and help him to read<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Join him to play. I haven&#39;t played myself. I have another child who needs<br/>\n&gt; me and interrupts me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you can find time to play with him, get yourself an account, set up a<br/>\ncraft bukkit server and follow his lead to help him build the stuff he<br/>\nwants. You could learn a lot from it and it&#39;s great fun :-) Craft bukkit<br/>\nwill let you set up a peacefull server with hardly any monster if your son<br/>\nwants to be able to concentrate on building things and exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I cannot sit with him all the time while I attend to other things. While I<br/>\n&gt; am away, he gets banned from the servers because he doesn&#39;t read and cannot<br/>\n&gt; understand what is going on in the server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t let him go to adult servers alone. He will get kicked and banned. He<br/>\ncould be insulted too. Most servers have a lot of role playing going on,<br/>\nthey have building standards... letting your 5 year old play alone on their<br/>\nservers would be like taking him to the model making room in an architecture<br/>\nschool, armed with scissors and glue and letting him &quot;loose&quot;. People will<br/>\nget mad and kick him out and its not fair on anybody. If you want to go to<br/>\nadult servers, go with him, do the chatting for him, help him every step of<br/>\nthe way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to find servers that are friendly for young kids and will forgive<br/>\nhim doing a little grief. And even there, you probably need to stay close<br/>\nwhen he plays multi player. And you might need to help him with the<br/>\ndiplomacy side. Apologise for him if he brakes something by accident, be an<br/>\nambassador online for him and help other players understand he is only 5 and<br/>\nmeans no harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an yahoo list for unschooling gamers, I have found very friendly<br/>\nyoung minecraft friends for my kids there :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great thing, probably the best, is to setup a server and help his<br/>\nreal life friends setting up their own accounts so they can play together<br/>\n(you need to discuss that with the other children&#39;s parents of course. That<br/>\nworks best for cousins or if you have friends whose kids are friends with<br/>\nyour child).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Voice chat works nicely for us. My kids both have a gmail account with gtalk<br/>\nchat enabled. They can contact their friends who also have gmail accounts to<br/>\nchat with their real life friends. They love voice chatting while playing<br/>\nminecraft together. It helps them decide what to build, where, and roleplay<br/>\nin their minecraft world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Woooah! You might need to get realistic and lower your expectations here.<br/>\nYour son is only 5! Building a house for himself and maybe along with a<br/>\nfriend and big huge towers that go miles up... or funky pyramids... One of<br/>\nour friend player is developping an &quot;architectural eye&quot;, starting to want<br/>\nhis building to look less bulky and getting interested in design. But he is<br/>\n11. All the 5 year old I have seen playing build big bunkers, love blowing<br/>\nup stuff with TNT and adopting wolves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean if your son is into architecture, by all means support him. But you<br/>\nmight want to pay close attention to what is fun to HIM.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book.<br/>\n&gt; Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun<br/>\n&gt; digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him<br/>\n&gt; to the store, he never wanted to leave.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to<br/>\n&gt; study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or<br/>\n&gt; lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only he can say what&#39;s too much. Take the cues from him :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t want to leave the store, it sounds like it&#39;s not too much for<br/>\nhim. Educating yourself yo you have info available when he asks sounds like<br/>\na good idea, discovering stuff together and sharing excitement are very good<br/>\nway to nurture both the learning and the relationship :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Minecraft, strew and support my son&#39;s interest","postDate":"1312316632","msgId":62160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxNDA3MzI2LTJBMzktNDE3Ri04Q0Q1LTM4N0EyQ0RCMzBDRkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGoxOGRyOStzYTJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGoxOGRyOStzYTJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62158,"nextInTopic":62161,"prevInTime":62159,"nextInTime":62161,"topicId":62145,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And looking back and talking to her friend, Holly&#39;s summary to me was that what the mom wanted was for other moms to see her as a busily concerned mom who had researched The Best option of the moment, and would Do ANYthing to provide that for her children.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she was providing for her children, though, was instability, a panicky, reactive mother who criticized them and the people around them all the time, and acted as though their lives would be RUINED if she didn&#39;t do something NOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be that mom.<br/>\nDon&#39;t be a jittery tiger-mom of unschooling.<br/>\nTry to find calm and patience and acceptance, and then you&#39;ll find that you can think more clearly and there will be time to be quietly with your kids and you&#39;ll be better able to see what they themselves are interested in, without caring so much what people on blogs or this list THINK they should be interested in.  I think you&#39;re looking at them through filters instead of seeing them directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Minecraft, strew and support my son&#39;s interest","postDate":"1312295132","msgId":62154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCQzU1RjAwLTMxMTItNERBOS05Mzk1LUVFNUIxQzdFNjk1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGoxODljdStvYzI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGoxODljdStvYzI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62152,"nextInTopic":62155,"prevInTime":62153,"nextInTime":62155,"topicId":62145,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He wants to build some cool structures but expresses lack of ability to do that.

Or point at things in the room for ideas for him to draw.  Maybe you could draw too, with him, but not so well or so fast that he&#39;s discouraged. Maybe take the pencils and a drawing pad outside sometime when you&#39;re going somewhere, but don&#39;t press him to draw just because you brought it--he might want to do something else, and that would be good.

It is like you were on one island, Jihong, where a rather harsh type <br/>\n&gt; of schooling, including pressuring and shaming kids was the norm, and <br/>\n&gt; you leaped across the water to a new island, where the focus is on the <br/>\n&gt; kids enjoying their learning.

Reading. I will create a short list of words, phrases and short <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sentences to help him communicate with other players in minecraft<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are thinking in terms of subjects. Reading is a subject. Instead, <br/>\n&gt; think of how to help him play in a way that is as much fun as possible. <br/>\n&gt; Since he doesn&#39;t read yet, his playing will be more fun if you read for <br/>\n&gt; him, answer his questions, maybe lightly point out words that he uses <br/>\n&gt; frequently. But don&#39;t turn his fun into a lesson....he will learn to <br/>\n&gt; read when he&#39;s ready and he does not need you to fashion lessons, no <br/>\n&gt; matter how subtle they may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I am pushing this agenda a little bit. I thought he may play better if he could read. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot sit with him all the time while I attend to other things. While I am away, he gets banned from the servers because he doesn&#39;t read and cannot understand what is going on in the server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat creates lots of frustration for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI admit I am pushing it too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Socialization<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been trying to point out what are the more effective ways to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; communicate with other people. For example, being polite, being <br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsive, respecting other&#39;s work, asking for permission before <br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking things out of chest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might not know the social appropriateness of that particular <br/>\n&gt; &quot;society,&quot; so I&#39;d be careful about giving him too much instruction. He <br/>\n&gt; will figure it out. If he has problems, though, then you might help him <br/>\n&gt; figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through <br/>\n&gt; possible consequences. But, you didn&#39;t say he is having any kind of <br/>\n&gt; problems - so why would you need to intervene?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like what you said. &quot;you might help him figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through possible consequences.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit I have been lecturing!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange <br/>\n&gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does he think that sounds fun? He&#39;s pretty young still - I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; familiar enough with this stuff to know if doing video chat is a good <br/>\n&gt; idea for such a young boy, but maybe you should hold off until he <br/>\n&gt; expresses an interest. Have you mentioned getting together with other <br/>\n&gt; players? Does he think that sounds fun? Offer ideas, lightly! If his <br/>\n&gt; eyes light up, follow through<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat point!  &quot;If his eyes light up, follow through&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design <br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making <br/>\n&gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has he expressed any interest in architectural design? This seems way <br/>\n&gt; over the top - he wants to play a video game and you&#39;re planning for him <br/>\n&gt; to learn drafting, make model buildings, and visit architects?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to build some cool structures but expresses lack of ability to do that. I wonder a visit with architect would help him to learn how the creative ideas are formed and may enhance his building creation. When he sees other minecraft creations, he often says, &quot;wow, it is so cool. how did they do that? I wish I could build something like that&quot;. I don&#39;t know how to help him to realize his desire to build better buildings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Those are just ideas. I have to learn myself if I want to facilitate <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or put resources together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4. Geology<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He is very interested in rocks, gems and minerals. Maybe I can help to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; expand into geology. Ideas or suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; An interest in rocks, gems, and minerals IS an interest in geology - <br/>\n&gt; that is what geology is. Are you thinking of it as a school subject? <br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t he just be interested in rocks, gems, and minerals? Collect rocks <br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re out in different places. There are a few interesting things <br/>\n&gt; about rocks you might mention, but, seriously, keep it light. I feel <br/>\n&gt; very overwhelmed by your plans/list and I&#39;m not a little boy. Just let <br/>\n&gt; him collect rocks and organize them as he sees fit. And if he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to collect them, that&#39;s okay, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please let him have fleeting interests - don&#39;t blow every interest up <br/>\n&gt; into some big thing. Offer just a tidbit at at time, don&#39;t design a life <br/>\n&gt; plan based on what could very very likely be a passing interest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got books, excavation kit, collect rocks, go to stores...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh dear.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book. Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him to the store, he never wanted to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5. Art<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Make minecraft the theme for art and craft. We drew creepers or sculpt <br/>\n&gt; &gt; creepers. Need to do more. MaybeCollect all the minecraft art on the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Internet. IF<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe just a little....IF that is something he&#39;s interested in - mostly <br/>\n&gt; just do have some cool art supplies around the house. If he wants to do <br/>\n&gt; some sort of minecraft related art, he will.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes to draw, but lots of time he asked me what he should be drawing. I don&#39;t know either, so I suggested creepers :))<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should have more books laying around the house and he can find some inspiration when he needs ideas???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6. City planning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is another theme we can focus on and learn about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would you do that? Serious question! Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he watched youtube and found the city other players built fascinating, he asked me, &quot;mama, how can I build something like that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought maybe we could explore &quot;city planning&quot;, what a city should consist of, what consideration should go in when someone builds a city.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am not sure I am following and supporting his interests, or I am overdoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Pam.

So I wonder if I should help with more suggestions, directions and help him to expand more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts are based on the belief that I may know more related subjects and connections of the subject he is interested. In this case, he loves building. So I got those ideas to help him to expand. I thought that was what strewing is about.

So i want to help him more on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have difficulty understanding the concept of strewing. I would appreciate clarification on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when I suggest activities, he always resisted but had a great time when he tried it out. so i am not sure if i should continue to confront his resistance or just follow his lead. for example, tonight we had a great time blowing bubbles, chasing bubbles outside. bu he didnt want to go in the beginning. same thing with other activities, like swimming, picking berries, which he loved before and still enjoys once i get him to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thought on the resistance part?

But don&#39;t turn his fun into a lesson....he will learn to <br/>\n&gt; read when he&#39;s ready and he does not need you to fashion lessons, no <br/>\n&gt; matter how subtle they may be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Socialization<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been trying to point out what are the more effective ways to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; communicate with other people. For example, being polite, being <br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsive, respecting other&#39;s work, asking for permission before <br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking things out of chest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might not know the social appropriateness of that particular <br/>\n&gt; &quot;society,&quot; so I&#39;d be careful about giving him too much instruction. He <br/>\n&gt; will figure it out. If he has problems, though, then you might help him <br/>\n&gt; figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through <br/>\n&gt; possible consequences. But, you didn&#39;t say he is having any kind of <br/>\n&gt; problems - so why would you need to intervene?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange <br/>\n&gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does he think that sounds fun? He&#39;s pretty young still - I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; familiar enough with this stuff to know if doing video chat is a good <br/>\n&gt; idea for such a young boy, but maybe you should hold off until he <br/>\n&gt; expresses an interest. Have you mentioned getting together with other <br/>\n&gt; players? Does he think that sounds fun? Offer ideas, lightly! If his <br/>\n&gt; eyes light up, follow through<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design <br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making <br/>\n&gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has he expressed any interest in architectural design? This seems way <br/>\n&gt; over the top - he wants to play a video game and you&#39;re planning for him <br/>\n&gt; to learn drafting, make model buildings, and visit architects?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Those are just ideas. I have to learn myself if I want to facilitate <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or put resources together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4. Geology<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He is very interested in rocks, gems and minerals. Maybe I can help to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; expand into geology. Ideas or suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; An interest in rocks, gems, and minerals IS an interest in geology - <br/>\n&gt; that is what geology is. Are you thinking of it as a school subject? <br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t he just be interested in rocks, gems, and minerals? Collect rocks <br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re out in different places. There are a few interesting things <br/>\n&gt; about rocks you might mention, but, seriously, keep it light. I feel <br/>\n&gt; very overwhelmed by your plans/list and I&#39;m not a little boy. Just let <br/>\n&gt; him collect rocks and organize them as he sees fit. And if he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to collect them, that&#39;s okay, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please let him have fleeting interests - don&#39;t blow every interest up <br/>\n&gt; into some big thing. Offer just a tidbit at at time, don&#39;t design a life <br/>\n&gt; plan based on what could very very likely be a passing interest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got books, excavation kit, collect rocks, go to stores...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh dear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5. Art<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Make minecraft the theme for art and craft. We drew creepers or sculpt <br/>\n&gt; &gt; creepers. Need to do more. MaybeCollect all the minecraft art on the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Internet. IF<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe just a little....IF that is something he&#39;s interested in - mostly <br/>\n&gt; just do have some cool art supplies around the house. If he wants to do <br/>\n&gt; some sort of minecraft related art, he will.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6. City planning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is another theme we can focus on and learn about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would you do that? Serious question!
