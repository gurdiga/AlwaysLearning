Create a simple balance beam for them to walk on. Look into getting some of those balls with the handles on top so they can bounce around the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about party games, too - balloon stomp can be great fun for a pair of little kids, or offer to tie them together like in a 3-legged race. Or get some big pillowcases so they can hop around like a sack race (pretend they&#39;re kangaroos, maybe or giant bunnies). Play blind-man&#39;s bluff with them and simon-says and red-light, green-light. Twister is a blast with little kids - and there&#39;s a new kind of Twister with rings, too.

Lots and lots of 4yos still need a lot of help being gentle, much less 3yos. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect a 3yo to have much in the way of perspective and empathy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;James kicked her in the back with his ice skate. It was clearly intentional.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that &quot;intentional&quot; for a 3yo means something a little different than for an adult. A 3yo is still learning a whole lot about cause and effect. They&#39;re fascinated by &quot;what happens when...?&quot; In that sense, it might have been intentional, but it probably wasn&#39;t Personal in anything like an adult sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I sat us all down, held Ella, held James with the other arm and pointed out to James that Ella was hurt by his actions.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you spent far, far too long trying to explain. Cuddle your daughter and say &quot;don&#39;t do that, it hurts&quot; and drop it - anything more is likely to confuse the issue for him. He wants to know what happens next! So what happened next was &quot;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.&quot; It won&#39;t be as helpful to him in terms of learning about the world as a solid, firm &quot;Don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the last few weeks the lashing out seems to be escalating<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Naming it &quot;lashing out&quot; can get in the way of seeing the needs behind the action. Is he angry and frustrated when he does it? A kid who goes on the offensive when he&#39;s upset is lashing out. A kid who hits too hard when he&#39;s playing, or curious, or overstimulated, or trying to get your attention isn&#39;t lashing out - those are different issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; James had said he had had enough of skating but they were still on the rink.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have left - said &quot;sounds like the kids are done&quot; and packed it in. If he&#39;s hitting etc more when he&#39;s tired and hungry, bring snacks and things to do that allow the kids to take breaks. Is there a cafe area at the rink? Bring a thermos of hot coco and a bag of mini marshmallows, a bunch of coloring books and a game (or quarters if they have arcade games) and encourage the kids to spend some time mellowing out. You can&#39;t change other people&#39;s parenting, but you Can be more proactive yourself and set your daughter up for better chances of success with her friend. To do that, it&#39;s up to you to stop seeing this boy as bad and see him as a person trying to communicate his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It wasn&#39;t a hard kick and Ella was not hurt.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; James kicked Ella leaving a very small nick just below her clavicle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she wasn&#39;t hurt - or barely - I&#39;d say you could be over-reacting in a way that&#39;s common of mothers who don&#39;t have sons and didn&#39;t grow up with casually rowdy play. Typically, boys roughhouse more than girls. I have a girl with a lot of energy who likes to roughhouse, so I know it&#39;s not some kind of hard and fast rule that only boys play rough ;) but even rough and tumble girls develop a slightly different set of reactions to rough play than boys. Mo&#39;s more likely to go away and cry when she&#39;s hurt (rough play means occasional hurts) and then return to the play. Her guy friends are more likely to hit back first, and then  cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who has energetic kids myself, one of whom was fairly explosive, I&#39;d suggest the boy may need more bigger boys he can roughhouse. That may mean he&#39;s not a good playmate for your daughter if she (or you) can&#39;t handle the rough stuff. Some kids need to play harder than others - and mixing a rough kid with a gentle kid can be a nightmare for everyone, leaving the rough kid feeling like a monster and the gentle kid feeling abused. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the same time, it&#39;s worth considering if the problem is that you don&#39;t know what rough play looks like and how to deal with the minor hurts that come with the territory. Have you tried leaving your daughter with this boy and his dad for an hour and seeing what happens? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what to do about Ella&#39;s impassioned plea to keep seeing this family?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nBe more proactive about meeting the boy&#39;s needs and more easy-going about the fact that kids sometimes get bumps and scrapes from one another.

She is also very attached to the boy&#39;s father who we meet for playdates once a week. I will call the boy James. James recently hurt Ella and I feel they could do with some distance but Ella is determined to continue this friendship. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Background:<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally the children will squabble over sharing a toy but generally the play is in woodlands, parks, soft play centres or the ice rink so fighting is not generally an issue. Occasionally James will hit out at Ella (or others) seemingly with no cause. All of a sudden he will just come over to her and wap her or push her - usually on the arm. His father mentioned that James sometimes did this to his mother to get her attention.  The father also repeatedly tells the boy not to hit and I make a point of being close by to diffuse situations or offer my hands  to James for boxing.  Ella also tells James not to hit her - not loudly but clearly. This all seemed to be manageable until the last month. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last few weeks the lashing out seems to be escalating culminating in a dangerous situation for my daughter. Two weeks ago at the ice rink, James, Ella and I were standing together off-ice when Ella lost her balance and fell.  James kicked her in the back with his ice skate. It was clearly intentional. She cried. I sat us all down, held Ella, held James with the other arm and pointed out to James that Ella was hurt by his actions. I asked him to put his fingers on my ice skate to feel how hard they are. He commented that they were soft and then tried to distract me with a piece of lint. He seemed uncomfortable with the intensity of emotion in front of him and ready for Ella to shift to &#39;happy&#39;. It wasn&#39;t a hard kick and Ella was not hurt. In fact, after she had a good cry she bounced right back up ready to play with James again -  all forgiven. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following week - two days ago - I came to our regular ice skating meet equipped with my &#39;I Call My Hand Gentle&#39; book  (which we all read together) and I stayed very close to Ella&#39;s side throughout the session. It is a big rink so we&#39;re not always with James - sometimes Ella skates off on her own, chats with instructors or with other parents. At one point, James the three of us were together - James, Ella and I. James kicked Ella leaving a very small nick just below her clavicle. I feel lucky it wasn&#39;t anything more than a little nick but given that I couldn&#39;t stop it when they were right beside me I will not be allowing them to skate together for the foreseeable future. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Ella had had a good long wail and recovered from the shock of being kicked with an ice skate she wanted to go and find James and his father. I explained they were probably taking some time to cool down. After some time James and his father appeared at the side of the rink and Ella begged them to stay. Not in a sad pleading way but in a friendly, inviting way. I think she really forgave it all. I am not feeling so forgiving and I am setting up a conference call with James&#39; parents to discuss how we are going to deal with the hitting moving forward because after the ice skating incidents I feel zero tolerance for inexplicable lashing out. This kid is not getting the point that it is not okay to hit Ella. And, by continuing to stay and play I feel we are reinforcing that all he has to do is say the words sorry and he can do it again and again and again. <br/>\n<br/>\nJames&#39; parents are suggesting that he is lactose and soy intolerant and even though they limit these things in his diet somehow it seems to sneak in, cause him pain, and cause him to lash out. I think that&#39;s a total cop out. I think the father is pushing James&#39; into situations that are more than James can handle. James had said he had had enough of skating but they were still on the rink. I now understand so clearly the advice I read on these lists about avoiding trigger situations for your kids until they are developmentally ready to handle it. So, I feel for this kid. It was the first time he looked like he felt genuinely sorry when he said the words. I also like the family but things are getting worse - not better. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do about Ella&#39;s impassioned plea to keep seeing this family? After the ice skating incident Ella was running around with James and I did not want to be there any more. I literally had to chase her, pick her up and whisper promises of ice lollies and easter eggs as she continued to struggle to stay and play as though nothing had happened. Today she was asking when she would go back to play at James&#39; house or when he might come to ours. It was casually asked. She knows that her father and I are upset about the latest ice skating incident but she seems pretty cool and collected about it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, wisdom, advice on how to handle this would be so gratefully received. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, <br/>\n<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65352,"nextTopicId":65355}}
