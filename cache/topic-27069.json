Not that I didn t believe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1265461244\">I recently attended a local homeschool group a couple times and got <br/>\nto finally see what Sandra and others have been talking about. Not <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t believe people, but I had not actually witnessed it <br/>\nmyself firsthand ...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at a &quot;park day&quot; and the mother was at the pavillion with her <br/>\ndaughter, who was barely seven. The girl was sitting next to her <br/>\nmother doing some worksheets, and very obviously not happy about any <br/>\nof it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI heard the mother say things like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you don&#39;t stop whining, I&#39;ll make you sit alone over there and <br/>\nfinish these!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You don&#39;t get credit for it unless you do the whole thing <br/>\ncorrectly! Now try it again!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the kicker: &quot;Yes, you do understand! You are just CHOOSING to be <br/>\ndisobedient!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really painful to witness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always read/hear homeschoolers (who are not unschoolers) say that <br/>\nhomeschooling has really helped their family relationships and made <br/>\nlife more peaceful, but I don&#39;t see how that could be if that&#39;s the <br/>\nkinds of interactions they are having. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if they are not being completely honest for whatever <br/>\nreason, or if for them, that experience really IS good in their <br/>\neyes. Or if it&#39;s truly good most of the time, but just a &quot;bad <br/>\nmoment&quot; here and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, as I thought about it, it reminded me of years ago <br/>\nwhen I used to be &quot;against homeschooling.&quot; Part of the reason was <br/>\nbecause I imagined it being kind of like that ... mother sits trying <br/>\nto &quot;teach&quot; their kids, and both mother and kid getting frustrated. <br/>\nNow I wonder if that really IS what homeschooling looks like for a <br/>\nlot of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts. Sandra had posted here recently about a book <br/>\ncalled &quot;Survivor&#39;s Guide to Homeschooling&quot; (something like that) and <br/>\nI just put it on reserve at our library so I can learn more about <br/>\nthis &quot;other side,&quot; so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27066,"nextTopicId":27070}}
