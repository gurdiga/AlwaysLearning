That might mean a couple hand-held games, a laptop, a desktop computer, and a couple console systems, plus another tv just for movies - mix and match. Look at pawn shops for cheap used electronics. And help kids to wait - don&#39;t Expect them to wait gracefully, make it easier on them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Three may ask to go to the playground on the way home from the library, but the other two just want to go home.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThink ahead. Why do kids tend to want to go home? Food? Bring more food. Games/movies/toys? Bring things along with you. Travel with enough stuff to make stops easier on the kids who are ready to be in their own space. Maybe bring blankets so kids can make little &quot;dens&quot; in the car if they need some time alone. Make it easier to do both. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, go to the playground before the library - or instead. If certain kids are more outdoorsy than others, maybe plan for some to go to the library with another family while you take the energetic ones to the park - or vice versa. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;how I can say yes to differing requests without someone feeling their request is being delayed or denied?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s a delay, help the person waiting to cope with that - don&#39;t expect little kids to wait gracefully. Sometimes it can help to &quot;count down&quot; to whatever it is they want - I used to make checklists for my daughter as a way for her to see progress toward what she wanted. The checklists also helped me to keep from adding more things ahead of what I said I&#39;d do with/for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might need to be sensitive to who gets to be &quot;first&quot; - that&#39;s a bigger deal for some kids than for others! <br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, be sensitive to kids feelings. There Will be times when you can&#39;t help or not right away, but that doesn&#39;t mean they should suck it up and pretend everything&#39;s fine. Be understanding and compassionate when things don&#39;t work out. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My major issue","postDate":"1354243030","msgId":69701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1M0E5QzE3LTJDODAtNDY2Ny1BMTI3LUFCMjY5ODNEOTE2MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs5OHZpcys1Z2lsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs5OHZpcys1Z2lsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69700,"nextInTopic":69702,"prevInTime":69700,"nextInTime":69702,"topicId":69700,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- No bed times, trying to say yes more.-=- No bedtimes shouldn t be the goal.
