It&#39;s  <br/>\ncalled &quot;I will Comply&quot; and is to the tune of &quot;I will Survive.&quot; You  <br/>\nhave to sing it yourself; he didn&#39;t record it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/weirdal\">http://sandradodd.com/weirdal</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26168,"nextTopicId":26184}}
