We bought so much more house here for the same money, and it was a newer home. I think we doubled our square footage and our environment improved tremendously! Now when we visit CA, it seems so old and yucky looking after living here. Everything is newer here, and so much cheaper. Taxes, gas, fine dining, everything is cheaper and there is more variety. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the water problem goes, Lake Mead is the water source for Vegas, and with the last few years of drought, the lake has gone down drastically. There still are no water restrictions on Vegas yet, and last I heard, they are trying to get CA to stop taking so many shares of the Lake, apparently, they are taking much more than NV is. So at the moment, there is no immediate water problem, and NV is working to insure there won&#39;t be one in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you just file your notice of intent here and you  are homeschooling. Easy. There is so much to do here, we have to keep curbing our schedule because we join up for too many homeschooling things! <br/>\n<br/>\nNext time you come up here, take a drive to the NW area. The W is pretty good too. Also Green Valley, and then there is also Henderson which is pretty large and south of vegas - lots of homeschoolers there too!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin Yule            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Robin!
