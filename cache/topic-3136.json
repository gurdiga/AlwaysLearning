It&#39;s<br/>\njust the two of us, and I wouldn&#39;t miss it much, and if I did I could go<br/>\nvisit someone. It truly wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to me. When we got to<br/>\nMexico for a few days or a week, or go camping, there&#39;s no tv.  And no<br/>\ncomputer, which I miss a lot (anyone want to buy me a laptop?). But I&#39;m<br/>\nnot about to just get rid of the tv against her wishes so she can<br/>\nexperience life without it, just like I&#39;m not going to get rid of all the<br/>\nreading material in the house to experience life without that, or get rid<br/>\nof all the playmobil, or all the games.... <br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your child, or children?

There have been times they watched a LOT of tv. There <br/>\nare times when I&#39;ve seen one of them just turn on the tv when she can&#39;t think <br/>\nof anything else to do or when she&#39;s tired and cranky and wants distraction <br/>\nor to empty her overactive brain and just calm down. Oh wait, maybe that was <br/>\nactually me &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got wireless headphones so my husband can watch sports stuff without the <br/>\nrest of us having to listen to it all the time.  I got two sets, so sometimes <br/>\na couple of people will be watching a movie while the rest of us are in the <br/>\nsame room reading or playing a game or something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have cable with seemingly unlimited channels - there&#39;s almost always <br/>\nsomething good on. I think having so many options actually means we just <br/>\naccept it that we&#39;re going to miss good stuff and there&#39;s less concern about <br/>\nit. My husband and I and my 14 yo always seem to find time to look through <br/>\nthe PBS program guide and put a few things on the calendar that we really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to miss. She looks because she&#39;s into opera and musical stuff. We <br/>\nlook for the drama and documentaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is not a problem at all here. The kids have plenty of other things to do <br/>\nand they&#39;d rather do those things unless there is something they want to <br/>\nwatch on tv. I&#39;d say that my 17 yo watches maybe 2 to 4 hours a week. The 14 <br/>\nyo watches probably 4 to 6 hours  a week. The 11 yo watches about 4 to 6 <br/>\nhours a week. Some weeks we might watch more - we might watch a bunch of <br/>\nmovies in one week, for example.  But I&#39;d say that is pretty typical for the <br/>\nkids to choose to watch unless their dad or I encourages them to watch <br/>\nsomething with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that with young kids, though, that they can get &quot;caught up&quot; in <br/>\nwatching tv, if it is on all the time. And they can get sort of &quot;stuck&quot; and <br/>\nnot be able to move away from the tv on their own, to find something else to <br/>\ndo. So you might have to be aware of that and make sure that life is filled <br/>\nwith interesting and enticing alternatives. Sometimes people complain that <br/>\ntheir kids don&#39;t want to do anything but watch tv and yet it seems like maybe <br/>\ntheir lifestyle isn&#39;t as exciting and attractive as watching tv. I mean - <br/>\nwhat kid would say, &quot;NO I want to watch the Brady Bunch, if you were offering <br/>\nto take them out to ride on ponies, for example.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo- if my kids were choosing to watch what seemed to be excessive amounts of <br/>\ntv, I guess I&#39;d want to look really carefully at whether or not I was really <br/>\nproviding an environment that could compete with tv. In other words, I could <br/>\njust turn off the tv -- but that doesn&#39;t improve the kids options, that <br/>\nlimits them. Why not entice them away by making the other options more <br/>\ndesirable. I think it is hard for some people to figure out how, when you <br/>\nhave young children, to keep house, keep clean laundry around, feed <br/>\neverybody, and STILL provide a really stimulating environment. It may feel <br/>\nlike you have to give up on the housekeeping and other things in order to be <br/>\nas available as they need. That may be true. It isn&#39;t really &quot;available&quot; if <br/>\nyou&#39;re just &quot;there&quot; physically in the house, but busy doing laundry and <br/>\nwashing dishes and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis last stuff may not be the issue at all for the person who posted the <br/>\noriginal question -- just something to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3231,"nextTopicId":3251}}
