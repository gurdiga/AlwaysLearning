Even in college I would get other people to tell me about the book or just skim through it reading only what I had too unless it was an autobiography or something along those lines or something I thought looked interesting. Looking back on it now I know it was because I was always forced to read what I did not want to read. Now I can read what I want and I love to read. I now read a book a week or more. I can relate to kids who do not want to read because they have too read what they dont want to. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Peace and love,<br/>\n  Darlene <br/>\n   <br/>\n  PS: I am currently reading Sanda Dodd&#39;s new book &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and it is a joy to read and how wonderful it is that she let us into her family&#39;s lifes. I am so curious about the way other people live and what others lives are about. Some may call me nosey I believe I just have a desire to know what goes on in other peoples real worlds beyond my own. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 1 <br/>\nDate: Sat, 19 Nov 2005 05:18:37 -0000<br/>\nFrom: &quot;sam&quot; <br/>\nSubject: Re: Misunderstanding Unschooling?...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;d always already seen the photos and <br/>\n&gt; read the book anyway, but I would pretend it was new an interesting<br/>\nfor a <br/>\n&gt; couple of seconds, and then go back to my &quot;real&quot; book). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would always draw in class.
