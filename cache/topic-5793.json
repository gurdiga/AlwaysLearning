People can live great unschooling <br/>\nlives that aren&#39;t as wild or exciting as some others. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have phases and waves.   The kids all noticed that the February calendar <br/>\n(wall calendar in the kitchen) had two or three things written on every <br/>\nsingle day, and March was totally, clear, white blank.  Even when we turned <br/>\nthe page, not one single mark.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting Kirby&#39;s work schedule (which varies) on there, and karate and Holly&#39;s <br/>\ndrama class helped.  And now that the month&#39;s nearly over there&#39;s quite a bit <br/>\nmore, but still  there are five days blank.  I&#39;m sure we did or will do <br/>\nthings on those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext Tuesday there&#39;s a homeschool skating session (for socialization and <br/>\ndiscount &lt;g&gt;).  Thursday the community center is closed for the school&#39;s <br/>\nspring break, and so the homeschoolers are meeting at the aquarium instead.  <br/>\nA dollar a head for what is  usually $3.50 to $5.50.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are cheap and easy ways for me to offer something I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nbother to organize.  Marty loves to ice skate and will help younger kids <br/>\ngenerously.  I usually figure that part of it is the most valuable for him.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve never mentioned it; it&#39;s secret to me.  But I see him learning how to <br/>\ndeal with younger beginning skaters, and figure out what they need to know <br/>\nand how best to show them or tell them, and learning it&#39;s different for <br/>\ndifferent people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same skating rink has a roller blade side.  Holly would rather roller <br/>\nblade.  The Cordova family, or original unschooling buddy-family, will be <br/>\nthere too.  I&#39;m pretty excited.  So we&#39;ll all be getting different things out <br/>\nof the day.  It&#39;s a 40 minute drive (unusual for Albuquerque) and that will <br/>\ndeliver unguessed-at opportunities for music  or conversation or to see <br/>\nsomething unexpected.  So it&#39;s &quot;just skating,&quot; but I know it&#39;s not that. It&#39;s <br/>\na day of unmined potential, with old friends and new friends.  It&#39;s a chance <br/>\nfor newer homeschooling families to spy on Marty and Holly (both &quot;lifers&quot; in <br/>\nthat group) to see how they are.  Behind my back, my kids have made a lot of <br/>\ntentative homeschoolers feel a lot more relaxed about the possibilities.  If <br/>\nmy kids can be that &quot;civilized&quot; without any school at all, maybe these newer <br/>\npeople&#39;s angst about units or curriculum just isn&#39;t worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say, I guess, is that after years of unschooling the days <br/>\nlook different.  What might look very educational might just be a leisurely <br/>\nday in an airconditioned museum with not much longterm effect.  What might <br/>\nlook like yardwork might be the highlight of the learning- and life-changing <br/>\nweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5757,"nextTopicId":5799}}
