My mother was horrified but let it be. Looking back, it seems crazy to me that I went out in the snow (and walked to school) like that. Now I have little cold-tolerance. I think it was partly a fashion choice on my part, but I can honestly say the wet snow seeping into my shoes (and wearing cold, wet shoes in school all day) didn&#39;t bother me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know a kid who made the decision to wear shorts every day throughout the winter. It was a personal challenge for him and he was committed to it. His parents supported him and he wasn&#39;t harmed.
