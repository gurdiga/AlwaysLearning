It also seems tied into Erikson&#39;s 4th stage of development, Industry vs. Inferiority, and as I recall it&#39;s pretty normal for kids to want to track achievements in some ways at that age, to have some sort of concrete representation of what they&#39;ve done, especially when it&#39;s a task done over a period of time. The whole badges concept in scouting feeds right into this need, for example. Rain used to make up charts with her daily and weekly routine just to be able to mark X in the little box, no reward required. <br/>\nWhen Rain did these charts, they never lasted very long (although they did evolve into lists, which she still utilizes) and I never made a big deal out of them.

So now his friends are carrying books everywhere<br/>\nand not playing much because they have to read so many books by a<br/>\ncertain date for each reward.  The 10 year old was actually reading on<br/>\nNew Years Eve while we were over there instead of playing with the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven at the park yesterday, two of the older kids brought books and<br/>\nread rather than play, because they are trying to read a certain<br/>\nnumber of books by Friday to get their reward, and one was trying to<br/>\nnegotiate with the mom about getting their reward on Friday even if<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t quite through with the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt had never occured to Aaron that some kids get rewards for doing<br/>\nstuff they wouldn&#39;t do anyways, and I guess the novelty of the idea<br/>\nappeals to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how should I approach this?  He isn&#39;t letting go, in fact, he asks<br/>\nat least a couple times a day since New Years if I have made his<br/>\n&quot;reading chart&quot; for him yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has decided his &quot;reward&quot; should be an ice cream cone from Ben &<br/>\nJerry&#39;s on Fridays for doing his lessons (of which he has none because<br/>\nI don&#39;t try to teach him to read, or anything else).  His sister works<br/>\nat B&J, and he can have an ice cream cone any time he goes there.  So<br/>\nit isn&#39;t anything that he couldn&#39;t get just for walking into the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any reading curriculum stuff even in the house, except<br/>\nfor an old copy of 100 EZ Lessons, and I don&#39;t even know where that is<br/>\nright now, so I am not sure what he thinks his &quot;lessons&quot; should look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do I make him a chart and give him some stickers, and let him<br/>\ndecide when to put them on and for what reasons?  Do I print out<br/>\nphonics worksheets from the internet for him to fiddle with for a few<br/>\ndays?  I can&#39;t imagine this lasting more than a week or two.  *I*<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t want to be dragged back into that world of stickers<br/>\nand rewards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else ever had a child want to explore the school-at-home world<br/>\na little bit?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Susan in VA<br/>\nwifetovegman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24056,"nextTopicId":24065}}
