So its &quot;respectful&quot; to hurt them a little, bully them a little, force them a little as long as its not &quot;too much&quot; and is always &quot;for their own (future adult) good&quot;. There&#39;s no conceptual reference for most adults to see chidlren as people (not innocents-or-monsters but actual people with thoughts and feelings and hopes and dreams). I&#39;ve had people irl say to me &quot;wow, you mean something Really Different by &quot;respect&quot; than other parents&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;There should be a <br/>\n&gt; 4th option called relationship parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To some extent, that&#39;s what attachment parenting sets out to do - the trouble is the frame of reference for most parents is still focused on producing better adults. That&#39;s why its so easy for attachment parents (and people who &quot;unschool from birth&quot;) to slide into the conveniently shaded area on the chart. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s essay, &quot;Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life&quot;:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joy\">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a><br/>\ngets into that to some extent, describing the difference between happiness and joy. She comments: &quot;Part of the pre-packaged life Americans are issued is the idea that happiness comes after...&quot; and lists college and home-ownership, but the sentiment is summed up well in that phrase. Happiness comes &quot;after&quot; and the goal of parenting is to get kids to &quot;after&quot; - to adulthood, however its defined. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ***Cite major differences between authoritative, authoritarian, and <br/>\n&gt; permissive child-rearing styles and its effects on the child&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; development. ***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Every time I&#39;ve looked up parenting articles or parenting styles, it always <br/>\n&gt; refers back to that triad.

If you were a parent, which style would best fit the way <br/>\nyou think you would raise your children? Respond to at least two other <br/>\npostings in your group.***<br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthoritarian parenting, which is not an ideal choice when raising a <br/>\nchild, is what most people think of when they think of &quot;bad parenting.&quot; <br/>\nAuthoritarian parents &quot;yell, command, criticize and threaten, demanding <br/>\nunquestioning obedience. If the child resists, authoritarian parents <br/>\nresort to force and punishment&quot; (Berk 216). Children with authoritarian <br/>\nparents do not develop able to self regulate their moods well, are often <br/>\nhostile and are low in self-esteem. Authoritarian parents often employ <br/>\npsychological control as well, in which their children are unable to <br/>\nmake any of their own decisions, and the parents make them all instead, <br/>\nthrough manipulation, including putting down the child&#39;s decisions, or <br/>\nwithdrawing affection if the child disobeys. Because of this, children <br/>\nof authoritarian parents have difficulty regulating their emotions, and <br/>\nare often hostile or withdrawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother alternative parenting style is permissive. Though this style can <br/>\nlook nicer on the outside, it is as damaging to child&#39;s development as <br/>\nthe authoritarian parenting style. Permissive parents are removed from <br/>\ntheir children, and are either &quot;overindulging or inattentive&quot; (Berk <br/>\n216). Because of this, their children are often forced to make decisions <br/>\nthey are not developmentally ready to make yet. These children have no <br/>\nhelp from their parents in making decisions such as when to go to bed, <br/>\nor when or what to eat. Children that come from these types of homes <br/>\nbecause rebellious, are overly demanding, and show a lack of follow <br/>\nthrough on difficult projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of the above parenting styles promote healthy development. A <br/>\nthird option, authoritative child rearing, is thought by most to be the <br/>\nideal parenting style. Authoritative parents are kind, loving and <br/>\nconscientious of their child&#39;s wants and needs. They form a secure <br/>\nattachment with their child, and pay attention to what their child is <br/>\nfeeling. However, they are not permissive, in that they exercise healthy <br/>\ncontrol. They tell their children what kinds of behavior is expected of <br/>\nthem, both at home and out of the house, and if the child disobeys, they <br/>\nuse techniques such as time outs or loss of privileges to punish them, <br/>\ninstead of yelling or physical punishment. Children of authoritative <br/>\nparents grow up independent, with high self-esteem, and a strong <br/>\nconnection to their parents. They are positive and able to work through <br/>\ntasks that a child raised by either authoritarian or permissive parents <br/>\nmight give up on quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy childhood was unusual, and does not fit well into any category. If I <br/>\nwas going to choose one, I would go with authoritative. My parents were <br/>\nsupportive, warm, loving and always there for me. They helped me to be <br/>\nindependent and autonomous. They allowed me from a very young age to <br/>\nmake decisions about every aspect of my life, but did not leave me alone <br/>\nto fend for myself. They were always there to help and advise. This is <br/>\nstill how our relationship is today, and I am nineteen years old. I have <br/>\nthe freedom to make my own choices, but a close bond with both my <br/>\nparents, so I can ask for assistance or counsel if I need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Mean Parents meme WAS Re: Phrases","postDate":"1287713783","msgId":57867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltdHdiOFRndlNLVkxyejNQdm5WYXV3ZmFIZUt0a3NFTzVORlNkSEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRDNFNzNDMkUyN0M3OS0xQzkwLTc2MDhAd2VibWFpbC1tMDM4LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDhDRDNFNzNDMkUyN0M3OS0xQzkwLTc2MDhAd2VibWFpbC1tMDM4LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57866,"nextInTopic":57868,"prevInTime":57866,"nextInTime":57868,"topicId":57850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh and what I think is wonderful is awful stuff like lauding mean parenting, sad though it is, brings the realization of how foreign such thinking is to me and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-558589826\">Oh and what I think is wonderful is awful stuff like lauding mean<br/>\nparenting, sad though it is, brings the realization of how foreign<br/>\nsuch thinking is to me and Brian now since we&#39;ve been into<br/>\nunschooling.

It seems<br/>\nlike it&#39;s in the same vein as this Phrases thread but it&#39;s a whole slew of<br/>\nphrases that are all similarly presumptuous about the nature of children and<br/>\nparenting. I couldn&#39;t find the meme again in order to quote it but it said<br/>\nsomething like &quot;My parents were so MEAN that they made me do all this stuff<br/>\nand I&#39;m glad/thankful to them now that I&#39;m an adult and a parent too... If<br/>\nyou had MEAN parents like I did, then post this in your status to show your<br/>\ngratitude.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA search turned up the following blogpost which is a paraphrase of what I<br/>\nsaw on Facebook or possibly the inspiration of that meme, and it&#39;s from this<br/>\nlink (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolacademy.com/articles/mean-parents-articles.html)\">http://www.homeschoolacademy.com/articles/mean-parents-articles.html)</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMean Parents....<br/>\n* [image: accredited home school]*As an adult I see the wisdom of my<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe letter below is from a child much like yours who is now an adult much<br/>\nlike you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust you will find it encouraging and fun - - perhaps it will remind you<br/>\nof your parents; perhaps it will remind you of yourselves. Either way, be<br/>\nproud and know that what you are doing will have a lasting and rewarding<br/>\neffect on the lives of your precious children!<br/>\n*Mean Parents *<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday when my children are old enough to understand the logic that<br/>\nmotivates a parent, I will tell them, as my Mean Parents told me: I loved<br/>\nyou enough to ask where you were going, with whom, and what time you would<br/>\nbe home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved you enough to be silent and let you discover that your new best<br/>\nfriend was a creep. I loved you enough to stand over you for two hours while<br/>\nyou cleaned your room, a job that should have taken 15 minutes. I loved you<br/>\nenough to let you see anger, disappointment, and tears in my eyes. Children<br/>\nmust learn that their parents aren&#39;t perfect. I loved you enough to let you<br/>\nassume the responsibility for your actions even when the penalties were so<br/>\nharsh they almost broke my heart.<br/>\nBut most of all, I loved you enough to say NO when I knew you would hate me<br/>\nfor it. Those were the most difficult battles of all. I&#39;m glad I won them,<br/>\nbecause in the end you won, too. And someday when your children are old<br/>\nenough to understand the logic that motivates parents, you will tell them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere your Parents mean? I know mine were. We had the meanest mother in the<br/>\nwhole world! While other kids ate candy for breakfast, we had to have<br/>\ncereal, eggs, and toast. When others had a Pepsi and a Twinkie for lunch, we<br/>\nhad to eat sandwiches. And you can guess our mother fixed us a dinner that<br/>\nwas different from what other kids had, too. Dad insisted on knowing where<br/>\nwe were at all times. You&#39;d think we were convicts in a prison. My Parents<br/>\nhad to know who our friends were, and what we were doing with them. My<br/>\nParents insisted that if we said we would be gone for an hour, we would be<br/>\ngone for an hour or less.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were ashamed to admit it, but My Parents had the nerve to break the Child<br/>\nLabor Laws by making us work. We had to wash the dishes, make the beds,<br/>\nlearn to cook, vacuum the floor, do laundry, empty the trash and all sorts<br/>\nof cruel jobs. I think My Parents would lie awake at night thinking of more<br/>\nthings for us to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Parents always insisted on us telling the truth, the whole truth, and<br/>\nnothing but the truth. By the time we were teenagers My Parents could read<br/>\nour minds and had eyes in the back of her head. Then, life was really tough!<br/>\nMy Parents wouldn&#39;t let our friends just honk the horn when they drove up.<br/>\nThey had to come up to the door so My Parents could meet them. While<br/>\neveryone else could date when they were 12 or 13, we had to wait until we<br/>\nwere 16 and then only in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of our mother we missed out on lots of things other kids<br/>\nexperienced. None of us have ever been caught shoplifting, vandalizing<br/>\nother&#39;s property or ever arrested for any crime. It was all her fault. Now<br/>\nthat we have left home, we are all educated, honest adults. We are doing our<br/>\nbest to be mean parents just like my Parents were. I think that is what&#39;s<br/>\nwrong with the world today. It just doesn&#39;t have enough mean Parents!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57863,"nextTopicId":57900}}
