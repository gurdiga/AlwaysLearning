What&#39;s surprising is that it works for some people! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur brains love pulling patterns out of chaos. It&#39;s how we learn to speak -- without even knowing what speech is! -- practically effortlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s disheartening is that the memorization *feels* like learning because students can repeat it back. But they don&#39;t necessarily understand in a rich meaningful way what they&#39;ve memorized. It&#39;s like a trap. It can feel so satisfying to pack your head full of other people&#39;s facts of how the world works but it doesn&#39;t give you their understanding or help you build your own understanding. It lacks the rich, meaningful connections we form as we play, do stuff, read, see, taste, immerse ourselves in what intrigues us. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Some* voracious readers do make many rich connections as they read. They&#39;re asking questions, seeing patterns, relating what they&#39;re learning to what they already know. It&#39;s how their brains naturally work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I obviously need to do something different, just not sure what (also have just turned 8 yr old son).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two things:<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people have had it pounded into their heads that the best way to learn is through books and classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one, Let go of that idea. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *convenient* and *cheap* for schools to depend on books. Schools can have one teacher making 30 kids go through the same process. But humans just don&#39;t learn well that way. They can memorize. What they memorized can be tested. It looks good on paper! But it doesn&#39;t translate to profound learning. It&#39;s the difference between how well you learned your native language and how well you learned a foreign language in school.

It may look like playing video games and watching TV. Reassure him that it&#39;s normal. It&#39;s like he&#39;s recovering from a broken leg.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretend it&#39;s summer vacation. Offer things you think *he* might enjoy with total disregard to whether they&#39;re &quot;important&quot; or not. If you find yourself thinking &quot;This would be good for him,&quot; stop. How would you present this idea to him if it were a tractor pull or skateboard championship? If he turns the idea down, how much investment that he participate do you feel?

You can gain a lot of great wisdom from listening to the contributors on this list, but it will be from an unschooling perspective. Chances are, learning won&#39;t look like the learning you&#39;re used to seeing in your eldest son, but it will be even more genuine and real!<br/>\nI&#39;d start with looking at the things that interest your son, and help him to find joy in that. Maybe he wasn&#39;t interested in the classes the co op had to offer. Or, maybe he doesn&#39;t enjoy a class format. Either way, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s learning things, they just might not be the things you&#39;re looking for.<br/>\nSandra has a wonderful site. You could browse there for hours!
