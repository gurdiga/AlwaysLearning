We&#39;re at the end of Lemony<br/>\nSnickets first Unfortunate Series book and I was very surprised and<br/>\ndisgusted that any word that&#39;s longer than six letters is defined in the<br/>\nbook!!!  Hello!!!  What ever happened to picking up the meaning from the<br/>\ntext????  I will have to say I was already predisposed to not like the books<br/>\nas I had heard and read that nothing good ever happened to the kids and I&#39;m<br/>\na sucker for happy endings. But I tried to go into them with a open mind as<br/>\nmy kids really wanted to listen to them (we&#39;re listening in the car) and I<br/>\nhad heard mixed reviews.  So that may be part of what irratates me about the<br/>\nfact that he defines so many words, I feel that it interrupts the flow of<br/>\nthe story and that it&#39;s dumbing our kids down, let&#39;s assume that they can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure anything out for themselves and hand them it on a silver plate so<br/>\nwhen they encounter that word again they won&#39;t remember what it means.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents rant.<br/>\n******************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I read that in the bookstore, and that cracked me up. I think it&#39;s <br/>\nSUPPOSED to be funny, not dumbed down, that he does that.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17323,"nextTopicId":17328}}
