It was the logo of a band that I didnt even like all that much. I wanted it on my upper outside arm. In my state you have to be 18 so they wouldnt do it. But, I am pretty sure that if it was a loving memorial of a lost family member, that I got at a reputable, legal place, that would be a totally different scenario. And if I could share it with my father? What a memory that would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did get a different one at 19, then another at 23 and then my third and largest at 24. Im sure I will get more someday. I like them and I like the way they look.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she wants seems really important to her (not like, just getting a tatto to have one) and its going to be in a private place (not her neck).
