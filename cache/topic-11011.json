Statistically one or two of them will be gay.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Keith and I had two boys and no girl, we used to talk about what if one <br/>\nwas gay.  Statistically, it could happen.  And by what the Chinese say about <br/>\ncouples, the two people together will balance out into half (very) female and <br/>\nhalf (very) male.  I&#39;m not very pink.  Keith I met singing and dressing up in <br/>\ncostumes (albeit tough-guy Viking costumes, but they&#39;re still skirts with <br/>\namber necklaces! &lt;g&gt;), and majoring in theatre.  Now...   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we looked at the projected statistics about kids their age and we said <br/>\n&quot;Here&#39;s the deal; one could be gay, and one could marry an Asian and we have <br/>\nto be able to afford to visit the grandkids in Japan, or China, or wherever <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be.&quot;  So we just prepared ourselves for those possibilities or <br/>\nnot-unliklihoods early, instead of spinning comfortable visions of them <br/>\nmarrying in town and living next door or anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur next-door neighbor at the time was the pinkest little boy I&#39;ve ever, ever <br/>\nmet.  He loved coming to our house because he could dress up from our costume <br/>\nbox, and he loved to put on plays with the other kids, and fashion shows.   <br/>\nHis mom refused to let him sign up with Kirby for a jazz/tumbling/ballet <br/>\nclass when they were five.  She said NO BALLET.  He can play soccer if he <br/>\nwants to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great quote.  Good.  I found it current from the time.  Kirby was <br/>\nseven, nearly eight:<br/>\n<br/>\nMarch 22, 1994<br/>\nTwo little girls in our neighborhood both have crushes, sort of, on A.J., <br/>\nnext door, who gives every indication of growing up to be a cross-dressing <br/>\nQueen of the Night.  (The other day Kirby was talking about Rachel wanting <br/>\nA.J. to be her boyfriend.  I said, &quot;Does A.J. even like girls?&quot; and Kirby <br/>\nsaid.  &quot;Of course.  Why else would he always want to be Kimberly when we play <br/>\nPower Rangers?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11006,"nextTopicId":10990}}
