From the beginning, Dad was fascinated with this  <br/>\nenchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family. The  <br/>\nstranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on.  As I grew  <br/>\nup, I never questioned his place in my family. In my young mind, he  <br/>\nhad a special niche. My parents were complementary instructors: Mom  <br/>\ntaught us good from evil, and Dad taught us to obey. But the  <br/>\nstranger...he was our storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for  <br/>\nhours on end with adventures, mysteries and comedies. If I wanted to  <br/>\nknow anything about politics, history or science, he always knew the  <br/>\nanswers about the past, understood the present and even seemed able  <br/>\nto predict the future!  He took my family to the first major league  <br/>\nball game. He made us laugh, and he made us cry.  The stranger never  <br/>\nstopped talking, but Dad didn&#39;t seem to mind.  Sometimes, Mom would  <br/>\nget up quietly while the rest of us were shushing each other to  <br/>\nlisten to what he had to say,and she would go to the kitchen for  <br/>\npeace and quiet.  I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to  <br/>\nleave.  Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions, but  <br/>\nthe stranger never felt obligated to honor them. Profanity, for  <br/>\nexample, was not allowed in our home... Not from us, our friends or  <br/>\nany visitors.  Our longtime visitor, however, got away with four- <br/>\nletter words that burned my ears and made my dad squirm and my mother  <br/>\nblush.  My Dad did permit the liberal use of alcohol. The stranger  <br/>\nencouraged us to try it on a regular basis. He made cigarettes look  <br/>\ncool,cigars manly and pipes distinguished.  He talked freely (much  <br/>\ntoo freely!)about sex.  His comments were sometimes blatant,  <br/>\nsometimes suggestive, and generally embarrassing.  I now know that my  <br/>\nearly concepts about relationships were influenced strongly by the  <br/>\nstranger.  Time after time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet  <br/>\nhe was seldom rebuked... And NEVER asked to leave!!  More than fifty  <br/>\nyears have passed since the stranger moved in with our family.  He  <br/>\nhas blended right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at  <br/>\nfirst.  Still, if you could walk into my parents&#39; house today, you  <br/>\nwould still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for someone  <br/>\nto listen to him talk and watch him draw his pictures. His  <br/>\nname?..............<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n             We just call him, &quot;TV.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: This should be required reading for every household in America!<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps &quot;requirements&quot; of any sort are what makes TV so appealing.    <br/>\nAgain, none of my children is watching TV.  I&#39;m working through a DVD  <br/>\non my computer, but haven&#39;t had it on for two days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who make the anti-TV sites think WAY more about TV than  <br/>\nmost people I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to have a book (gave it to a DJ friend) detailing  <br/>\noffensive/&quot;satanic&quot; lyrics in rock and roll songs.  Someone had spent  <br/>\nhundreds of hours listening, transcribing, commenting, reviling...   <br/>\nHe could have just turned off the music!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30467,"nextTopicId":30497}}
