Yet we act as if it<br/>\ndoes by  letting it decide when, how, and what our children will learn.<br/>\nWe have turned  their futures over to lobbyists and bureaucrats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI support giving educational control back to parents, who know their<br/>\nchildren  better than any politician in D.C. ever will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe federal government has no constitutional authority to fund or<br/>\ncontrol  schools. I want to abolish the unconstitutional, wasteful<br/>\nDepartment of  Education and return its functions to the states. By<br/>\nremoving the federal  subsidies that inflate costs, schools can be<br/>\nfunded by local taxes, and parents  and teachers can directly decide how<br/>\nbest to allocate the resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help parents with the costs of schooling, I have introduced H.R.<br/>\n1056, the  Family Education Freedom Act, in Congress. This bill would<br/>\nallow parents a tax  credit of up to $5,000 (adjustable after 2007 for<br/>\ninflation) per student per  year for the cost of attendance at an<br/>\nelementary and/or secondary school. This  includes private, parochial,<br/>\nreligious, and home schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother bill I have sponsored, H.R. 1059, allows full-time elementary<br/>\nand  secondary teachers a $3,000 yearly tax credit, thus easing their<br/>\nfinancial  burden and encouraging good teachers to stay in an underpaid<br/>\nprofession.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents have already shown their desire to be free of federal<br/>\ncontrol by  either enrolling their children in private schools or<br/>\nhomeschooling them. And  students enrolled in these alternatives have<br/>\nconsistently performed better and  tested higher than those in state-run<br/>\nschools.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears of centralized education have produced nothing but failure and <br/>\nfrustrated parents. We can resurrect our public school system if we<br/>\nfollow the  Constitution and end the federal education monopoly.<br/>\nEducation   [On the Issues]<br/>\nCongressman  Ron Paul (R-Texas) is the leading advocate for freedom in<br/>\nour nation&#39;s  capital. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives,<br/>\nDr. Paul tirelessly  works for limited constitutional government, low<br/>\ntaxes, free markets, and a  return to sound monetary policies. He is<br/>\nknown among his congressional  colleagues and his constituents for his<br/>\nconsistent voting record. Dr. Paul never  votes for legislation unless<br/>\nthe proposed measure is expressly authorized by the  Constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nQP5KVM5tB8?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"},{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/IWfIhFhelm8?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":31657,"nextTopicId":31660}}
