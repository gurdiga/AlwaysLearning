I liked this, especially:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My classmates formulated their love for the Beatles in the following manner: <br/>\n&quot;I would have learnt English in its entirety, exclusively from the things <br/>\nthat Lennon spoke about.&quot; This was a paraphrase of the words of Mayakovsky <br/>\ninscribed on a stand in the literature classroom: &quot;I would have learnt Russian in <br/>\nits entirety, exclusively from the things that Lenin spoke about.&quot; In the 1960s, <br/>\nyou could not be imprisoned for changing the name of Lenin to that of Lennon, <br/>\nbut trouble awaited anyone who blasphemed against the name of the immortal <br/>\nleader: problems dished out by the Komsomol (Communist Union of Youth) could <br/>\nwreck your career. And so, bit by bit, we Lennon fans became ensnared in doubting <br/>\nthe values that the system was trying to inculcate. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any interest in the cold war, USSR or Beatles, it&#39;s worth reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in The Guardian today.
