They&#39;ve been studying <br/>\nSpain and the Moors and the connection to New Mexico.   They watched El Cid (my <br/>\ncopy &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m going in to play a dictionary game with them, which will <br/>\n(after I&#39;m gone) be tied in to a couple of handouts I&#39;m leaving (game kind of <br/>\nstuff, not worksheets at all)  and some connections of Arabic words in Spanish, and <br/>\nthe idea that languages are living and changing and where to co-exist they <br/>\nborrow words back and forth.  All that fun stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gathered up all the leftover paperback American Heritage dictionaries from <br/>\nlong ago when I used those as primary text.  It&#39;s a little spooky, but I think <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s going with me.  These kids are her age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who have lived here (or do), it&#39;s Sandia Prep, on Osuna.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ll have stories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18473,"nextTopicId":18497}}
