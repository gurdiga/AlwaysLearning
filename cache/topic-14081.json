So I can&#39;t say, but she did have 7/10 of <br/>\nthe indications of prematurity, and she was teensy and not very (what&#39;s the <br/>\nword for go-getter baby?)...  can&#39;t think of the word.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t in there 9 months (though I have no idea) but <br/>\nshe just wasn&#39;t quite at the strongest point of her curve.  Or maybe she was. <br/>\n She&#39;s kind of dainty compared to the boys too in other ways.
