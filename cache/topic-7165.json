It&#39;s the Home Educator&#39;s Cooperative of the Mid-Columbia.  &quot;The purpose of the Home Educators&#39; Cooperative of the Mid-Columbia (HEC) is to create a cooperative and supportive community of homeschooling families without regard to educational, political or religious philosophy. It is envisioned as a base for activities, outings and workshops, to meet the needs and interests of both novice and seasoned homeschoolers across the region.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group isn&#39;t very active right now.  It is really a cooperative, so there are no &quot;leaders&quot; making things happen.  There is a small group meeting weekly at a park and we have a yahoo group with about 70 folks on it.  I&#39;m the moderator.   I&#39;ve had a few people leave the yahoo group because, they said, they couldn&#39;t keep up with the volume of email.  Our busiest month ever had 240 emails.  That was for the entire month.  Most months are well below 200.  Days go by without a single email.  I think those people should join unschooling.com for a week, then they will see what too many emails look like!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group sponsors field trips, arranges group orders from Scholastic, and has occasional meetings on a variety of homeschool topics.  We even had David Albert come speak to us, and I got to have him stay at my house.  That was really cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not an unschooling group.  There are a few unschoolers, as well as some real school at homers, and other varieties too.  I will say though, that overall it is a very supportive group of people, even though our approaches to homeschooling are all very different.  Not to mention that our approaches to religion and politics are also very different.  More than a few of the families joined our group because they weren&#39;t the right kind of Christian for the local bible based group.  We also have atheists, agnostics, and a Jewish family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is probably more than you wanted to know :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n  ----- snip----- <br/>\n  By local group, I assume you mean local group of homeschoolers? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] getting it","postDate":"1051130187","msgId":13853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ny4xOTdmMjk0ZS4yYmQ4NTM0YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13851,"nextInTopic":13858,"prevInTime":13852,"nextInTime":13854,"topicId":7165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam, could you explain what you mean by a curriculum show and tell?

They like to have something from all the different <br/>\ntypes of curriculums out there, all the different companies. It gives people <br/>\na chance to see things before they go to the curriculum fair at the state <br/>\nconference. It is real casual, the items are set out on tables for people to <br/>\ncome in and look at.  Homeschoolers, people interested from the community <br/>\netc.  You just chit chat and answer questions about whatever it is you are <br/>\nusing, like how you like it etc.  I asked first before I went to make sure <br/>\nthat I would be welcome.  This is a very Christian homeschooling, school at <br/>\nhome area.  LOL. (Not that there is anything wrong with being Christian...did <br/>\nI get that out in time) LOL.  My table was actually very popular.  Maybe it <br/>\nwas like being the three headed pig a the circus side show.  Everyone had to <br/>\nsee me.

Ds is <br/>\ntotally thrilled about the coins and is paying for them himself.<br/>\nI read up on the language and some of the difficulties of translation to a <br/>\nsyllabic language like our own, then copied some symbols for him to look at. <br/>\nJust showed them to him and left it at that. What he does (or doesn&#39;t do) <br/>\nwith them is completely up to him.
