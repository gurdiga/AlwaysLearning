I have said nothing about keeping<br/>\nchildern away from all adults, nor society in general.<br/>\n I am saying that children are vulnerable and because<br/>\nof this they need protection.  We can not be<br/>\nabsolutely sure about anything, but i do know that if<br/>\nsomeone is already exhibiting signs of boundary<br/>\nviolations, then  children may be vulnerable in their<br/>\npresence.  This site is called always learning, are<br/>\nyou so right about this that you are unwilling to<br/>\nlearn something new when the opportunity presents<br/>\nitself. Perhaps it is time for you to do your own<br/>\nhomework. Your off the cuff comments are insensitive.<br/>\nIt amazes me that someone with your authority about<br/>\nhomeschooling is actually so out of touch with the<br/>\ntrue needs of a child.  I actually am happy to<br/>\nunsubscribe from this group based on the ignorance<br/>\nthat you, as the list leader exhibits.  I will not<br/>\nsupport a list that is moderated by someone so<br/>\nunprepared to speak up for the rights of a child.    -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 15<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 26 May 2004 12:48:53 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: about sexual abuse<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/26/04 5:44:18 AM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marymapel@...\">marymapel@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; One more thought about sexual abuse.  Sandra when<br/>\n&gt; you <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; suggest that empowering the child to say no is<br/>\n&gt; adequate <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; protection, what happens when that isn&#39;t enough? <br/>\n&gt; Does that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mean that it is the child&#39;s fault that they weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; strong enough?  It <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is not such a big leap to conclude this if you truly<br/>\n&gt; believe that all a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; child needs is education and a &quot;force field&quot; in<br/>\n&gt; order to be <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; protected.  Surey our children can not be held<br/>\n&gt; accountable for an <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; adults transgressions.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then keep your children away from adults.  <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a first time for everything.  Someone who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not YET a molester might <br/>\n&gt; start with your child.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Keep them away from teenagers, too.  And other<br/>\n&gt; children.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe if you were abused yourself, that puts you at<br/>\n&gt; risk to be an abuser.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
