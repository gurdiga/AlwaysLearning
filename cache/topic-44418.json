Getting cable TV is a necessity for people  <br/>\nfar from broadcast or translators.  In New Mexico lots of people live  <br/>\nwhere they can&#39;t get reception.  We, on the other hand. live in plain  <br/>\nview of the mountain that has the TV broadcast towers on it.   My  <br/>\nhusband is very thrifty, which comes in handy.  He&#39;s kind of techno- <br/>\navoidant (LOTS, considering that he&#39;s an engineer with a computer  <br/>\nscience degree).  He stalled forever about getting a CD player and  <br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t have a cellphone.   Because it makes him feel really  <br/>\ngood to avoid spending money and moving up electronically, I don&#39;t  <br/>\nwhinge (a word Schuyler loves) about cable.  Maybe I spend as much as  <br/>\nwe would spend on cable on buying DVDs.  I might even if we had cable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, cable isn&#39;t paying for every channel.  It&#39;s paying for  <br/>\nCHOICES of channels.  If you go to a buffet and eat what you want to  <br/>\neat, do you spend that time thinking about food that might still be  <br/>\nthere at the end of the shift, and that you don&#39;t like having paid for  <br/>\nthat food you didn&#39;t eat?
