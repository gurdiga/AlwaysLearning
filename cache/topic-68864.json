Gosh, those word parts can take you *anywhere*!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had another bit to add, to the part about word play being free and easy, harkening to school for some, and so being an opportunity for deschooling when it comes up sitting around on a Sunday morning in pajamas or floating in the lake on a Thursday afternoon. It&#39;s about numbers play, but I think the point carries.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday morning, Woody went out to sit with my mom on the porch while she drank her coffee. (We&#39;re nearing the end of our month-long visit to her here in Florida.) They were out there for a while, happily, and then Woody came in to do something else. My mom later told me that they had been playing his &quot;challenge game,&quot; where they were to try and stump each other with additions problems that were really hard to do in one&#39;s head. Only of course there was the difference of perspective of what constituted a hard math problem. So she was tickled that his eyes would get really big, and he&#39;d say in this weighty voice, &quot;Sixty plus ELEVEN!&quot; As if that would be the game-stopper. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nLike word play, it was free, spontaneous, easy, and an opener to something much larger--a very sweet moment between a little boy and his grandmother who, not too long ago, was worried that if I hoomeschooled him, I&#39;d never know if he was learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t presume to know what she was thinking at the time about learning in or out of school, but I could tell by the way she told the story that it was a happy moment for her and one in which an important relationship was strengthened. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nmama to Woody (6 1/2) and Fox (3 1/2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teresa, I know someone names Therese Honey who lives in Houston and plays harp.  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was going to leave a note at your blog, but it doesn&#39;t take notes.

We were trying wood burning for the first time, and in a quick Google search for a how-to video and design ideas, we learned that wood burning is also called pyrography, drawing with fire. My oldest, Woody, was very impressed with the meaning of that word, and my littlest, Fox, thought the word sounded like pirate, which was just dandy to him because at the craft store they&#39;d each picked out wooden &quot;swords&quot; (actually crosses) to wood burn designs into. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt turned out that drawing with fire was every bit as intimidating as it sounds.
