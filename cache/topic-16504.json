She was funny, she said &quot;mommy bring <br/>\nup word so I can write a book report for Ms. May.&quot;  Ms. May is the <br/>\nreading specialist where I teach, and a month or so ago she told Lexie <br/>\nthat Lexie could borrow any book in school as long as she occassionally <br/>\nwrote a book report about a book she had borrowed.  When this <br/>\nconversation took place, I just smiled and didn&#39;t say a word.  Later I <br/>\ntold Lexie she could borrow any book she wanted, she didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nwrite a book report unless she wanted to do so.  So tonight when she <br/>\nannounced that she wanted to write a book report, I reminded her that <br/>\nMs. May didn&#39;t have any right to ask for a book report from her, and <br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t have to do one.  She said, &quot;I know, but I want others to <br/>\nread this book, and I really liked this book and want to write about <br/>\nit.&quot;  OK.... But then she was concerned because the book she wanted to <br/>\nwrite about was not one she had borrowed from the school  &quot;Will Ms. May <br/>\nknow I didn&#39;t borrow this one?&quot;  I assured her that there were plenty of <br/>\nNancy Drew books in the library and also that if she wanted to write a <br/>\nbook report, she should write it on whatever book she wanted!

She even <br/>\nhelped me spell attak, attat--she says &quot;mom, try attic.&quot;  lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here it is<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBook Report<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy Drew<br/>\n<br/>\nMystery of Twin  Elms Mansion<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Lexie Fowler<br/>\n<br/>\n10/4/03<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a mystery book.  Mysteries are books where there is a crime to<br/>\nsolve and it is always solved near the end of the book.  The main<br/>\ncharacters in this book are Nancy Drew, Nancy&#39;s father (Mr. Drew),<br/>\nNancy&#39;s housekeeper (Ellen) and Nancy&#39;s friend.  The friend&#39;s family are<br/>\nalso in the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plot is that there is supposed to be a haunting in the mansion and<br/>\nNancy is called to solve it.  All these strange events happen.  One of<br/>\nthem, not to ruin the mystery, is there is a big scary face outside the<br/>\nwindow that only Nancy&#39;s friend sees.  That is pretty much the plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting is Twin Elms Mansion and the mansion next door, which is an<br/>\nexact replica.  Nancy&#39;s mansion and the servant&#39;s cottages for all but<br/>\nNancy&#39;s mansion are thought to be where a tunnel is.  I know this took<br/>\nplace in the past because the girls wore dresses all the time and the<br/>\npresident was different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chapter before Nancy&#39;s victory and Nancy&#39;s Victory is where the<br/>\nclimax is.  Her friend is going through the tunnel, which is a listening<br/>\npost, where someone would listen to the servants&#39; conversations, and the<br/>\ncriminal can use this tunnel to spy on the house, because it goes under<br/>\nthree rooms, ending under the kitchen.  And then Nancy finds a passage<br/>\nout on top, on the attic, and then she finds that there is a passage as<br/>\nwell leading from the mansion next door to the other mansion.  But her<br/>\nfather was kidnapped and they find her father and the mystery is solved!<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVED this book, I couldn&#39;t put it down!  I would recommend it to<br/>\nanyone who likes books with suspense!!  If you want a good book or just<br/>\nto pass time, you should pick up the Nancy Drew Mystery Books!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16527,"nextTopicId":16540}}
