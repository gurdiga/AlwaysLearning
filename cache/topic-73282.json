For a while I was reacting to every &#39;I want...&#39; with the feeling that it was up to me, right then, to either get them what they wanted, or to say no, and that was stressful. I&#39;ve realised now that its not always up to me, and that they are not always asking for something to happen right now. Often they are saying that they&#39;d like it sometime, or simply saying that they think it is cool. Sometimes I&#39;ll say &#39;yeah, that looks pretty exciting&#39; and that is enough. Other times we&#39;ll chat excitedly about how they&#39;d play with it alongside their other toys. Sometimes I put it on a wish list.&nbsp;</p><p>Other times we buy it next time we are out.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">I think by buying things when I can and saying yes a lot they feel confident that they will get the things that they really want so they are happy to wait and/or to accept that we won&#39;t buy EVERY toy that they see but they will have enough. I found the requests came much more frequently once we started watching commercial tv a lot last year (previously we had watched a lot of tv but most of it was our government funded channel (in Australia) which has great programming for kids and adults, with no commercials). So suddenly the kids were seeing ads for all sorts of things and asking for lots of them - I was feeling quite worried and pressured by this until one of the kids said that they were just saying that it would be cool to have it, not that they expected me to buy it.</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">I&#39;ve also found that when it does come to purchases, Liam has a very strong sense of what he will actually use - if he asks for something then he will treasure it and play with it. Caitlin likes the act of receiving things, but usually doesn&#39;t really use them once she has them. So I can help her feel satisfied by buying little things as often as I can, as well as spending lots of time with her. Liam doesn&#39;t need the little things and doesn&#39;t like gifts that aren&#39;t what he really wants, so I can wait and buy more meaningful things for him.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">All three of my kids are very generous with their own money and time and love to buy for other people. Both Liam and Caitlin bought or made gifts for everyone in our family (including grandparents, aunts and uncles)<span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">&nbsp;this christmas.</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Recently we were in our local op shop (thrift store) and Liam (who is 7) found some pokemon figures - 3 in a little bag for $2. I said I&#39;d buy it for him - and he said that there was only 1 figure that he wanted because he had the other ones. I said that it was ok to have 2 of the same if he wanted to get them - and he went up to the counter and asked the lady if he could just buy 1 of the figures and leave the others. She was surprised and also tried to talk him into the whole bag, but he insisted that he only needed the one and only wanted to buy that, so she said he could have it for 50c and we happily bought it. I was pleasantly reassured that by saying yes to as much as I can, and happily discussing their requests even when I am not able to buy something, that he still only wants what he really wants and doesn&#39;t just want everything he sees (which is what friends tell me will be the consequence of always saying yes)</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">So I guess what I have learnt is that by really seeing and knowing my children, what can look like insatiable want is not that at all (and the pressure I was feeling came from myself, not from my children). And that satisfying each child&#39;s want looks very different for each child - and knowing what each one needs to feel satisfied has been really helpful</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Annie</span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":365496082,"authorName":"mbyerly77","from":"&quot;mbyerly77&quot; &lt;mbyerly77@...&gt;","profile":"mbyerly77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: need help to view &quot;insatiable&quot; through an unschooling lens","postDate":"1389822527","msgId":73330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxiNnZudit1MjFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGxiM3NibCtqNXB1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73323,"nextInTopic":73337,"prevInTime":73329,"nextInTime":73331,"topicId":73282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"barbie.com   is great for games and exploring barbie and it is free!

There are free short videos there that are also pretty funny (the life in the dreamhouse series).<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the barbie dolls, clothes, furniture, accessories, my older daughters have enjoyed the barbie paper dolls and the cardboard magnetic dolls.  These are very inexpensive and come with A LOT of outfits.  They are a little harder to find.  Walgreens (pharmacy chain store in U.S.) sells them from time to time.  Maybe you can find online, though?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbie collector magazine (a catalog) is free.  You can get on their mailing list from their website (barbiecollector.com).  The dolls are amazing.  Most of the dolls are pretty expensive.  We have bought a few from time to time.  It might be nice for each barbie lover to receive their own catalog.  The barbie collector dolls (and the black-label barbies--they have those at Target from time to time) are thinner than the regular barbie, so they can generally wear the average sized barbie clothes, but not vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not barbie, but my daughters are really loving the game website therealtoothfairies.com.  It&#39;s free to join, but I think it&#39;s been worth the vip upgrade (pretty low-cost at about $5 per month).  There are lots of clothes, furniture, etc. to &quot;buy&quot; for the user&#39;s virtual hotel room.  There are some games on there too (how you earn your virtual money to spend).  One of the main features of the game is the virtual shopping experience (you even have a shopping bag that you empty).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have liked when I helped organize their barbies and accessories, set up barbie shops (they call it barbie world), and helped with barbie&#39;s hair grooming and hairstyles.  Sometimes I have done it upon request and sometimes as a surprise (though, I wouldn&#39;t change a hairstyle unless I was asked).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy second daughter (who is now 6) has enjoyed cutting barbie dresses she has tired of into new designs.  She is really good at it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my kids have cut barbie&#39;s hair.  They like doing it and sometimes those dolls become boys and sometimes the boyfriends of the other (still female) barbies (and they often seem to prefer these to the already male Ken dolls). <br/>\n<br/>\nI have cut some of my clothes (that I didn&#39;t want or had holes, etc.) into barbie (or baby doll) dresses, shirts, etc.  Sometimes, my kids wanted something new quick and they didn&#39;t mind that it wasn&#39;t sewed or hemmed and far from perfect.  Sometimes the outfit was only worn once. I have used small safety pins and even a glue gun to construct these in a couple of minutes.  Toilet paper works too.  I haven&#39;t tried anything on toilet paper yet, but it could be fun to pretty it up with markers or glitter or glitter glue might work especially well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: need help to view &quot;insatiable&quot; through an unschooling lens","postDate":"1389720757","msgId":73323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxiM3NibCtqNXB1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEyRDg1NkQ2LTkwNUYtNEJBQy04NzMyLUMwNjMwRjlBQzdCN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73322,"nextInTopic":73330,"prevInTime":73322,"nextInTime":73324,"topicId":73282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Ethan (my eleven year old son) helped me dress them.  He said he was really having fun.  As you can see from the photo, they are a motley crew.  Our cat just couldn&#39;t stand not being part of the fun, so he climbed in with them too.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncluded in the arrangement (you can&#39;t see it very well) is a sectional sofa that I made as a girl out of an old pair of corduroy pants, a cardboard box, some stuffing and some glue.  Sectional sofas were big in the 70s.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made that sofa myself, but my dad used to set me up with all kinds of supplies for accessorizing my doll collection.  He would bring cardboard home from his work.  He would pick up carpet and wall paper remnants for free from stores.  He collected scrap wood and taught me how to use a skill saw - hand first, powered later.  He cared that I cared about these dolls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom had one lady make some clothes for the dolls one Christmas.  She marveled when I made my own clothes out of Kleenex, and at the elaborate homes I built for them.  She didn&#39;t play with me.  I would have liked that, but that&#39;s okay.  She didn&#39;t have this awesome resource.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFind as many ways as you can to fill your daughter&#39;s cup.  Surprise her one day with some new creation for her dolls.  Set them up in an interesting scenario, and wait until she finds them.  Sit down and play with them with her.  Grab a Kleenex.  Make a skirt.  Build a house out of a cardboard box.  Help her decorate it.  Buy a second hand one, and let her find it one morning.  Get really creative and enjoy this time with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more I&#39;m discovering it&#39;s not so much about giving, as it is about building, and, as Sandra has said, investing.  You are setting the foundation for your daughter&#39;s future interactions with the people she will come to hold dear (yourself included) - many little gifts given by you, that your daughter will be able to generously pass on to the people she loves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: need help to view &quot;insatiable&quot; through an unschooling lens","postDate":"1389713941","msgId":73322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzODk3MTM5NDEuNjY0NTguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGxiMzg3NStkbTg4bHFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxhdmxyYStuNGJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkxVMTczLURTNzY3QUE3QUJCOUJGNDA3MDc2QTgxQzRCQzBAcGh4LmdibD4gPEJMVTE3My1EUzg1OUNERjU2NDM5NEM3MzFGQ0ZFREM0QkMwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDw2OUY4RDAyNy1GMzMxLTRGQjktODZENC03REM2NTQ2MEZEQTFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxsYjJmbG8rMXE3OHVncUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxBMkQ4NTZENi05MDVGLTRCQUMtODczMi1DMDYzMEY5QUM3QjdAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxsYjM4NzUrZG04OGxxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73321,"nextInTopic":73323,"prevInTime":73321,"nextInTime":73323,"topicId":73282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a bunch of Barbie books I found on Thrift stores!

It was an interesting thing, just after Christmas there was desire for more (in our case it was barbies, because their new barbies needed some friends!), and I felt like it was taking away from the magic of Christmas. My initial thoughts were, why have special gifts on these occasions when we can just go and hand over some more money to buy stuff whenever we want or feel like it? Its got me looking more deeply at how we splurge at birthdays and Christmas and in-between these two occasions, we don&#39;t buy much in the way of toys and stuff, and why this needs to be this way.

These are generally more expensive items I need to save up for. And when there are extra funds, we browse the list of wants, update it if needed, and sometimes we order online or purchase one of their chosen items from a local store. But sometimes, even after adding lots of fun ideas to the list, the girls would rather head to a local store and walk through, selecting instead something that was not on their wish list, and sometimes nothing at all. <br><br>This helps a lot with living on a budget. Each child has weekly allowance as well, tho I usually keep it on a tally, rather than the girls keeping cash, as they have had disappointment with lost money- so we work together and I always have an up-to-date figure in my phone.<br><br>Giving the children their own money to spend has also helped me stop judging their wants. When it was &quot;My Money&quot; I often judged the value of things they wanted to purchase and this was difficult for all of us. When it is their money, the only question I need answered is whether or not they have enough money. (But I find myself happier to chip in now too.)<br><br>&lt;Back to saying &quot;yes&quot; more.&gt;<br>My first thought was - do you mean &quot;back to saying yes&quot; as though you have stopped saying yes so much? If so, check that out. <br><br>&lt;How do you do that without running out of funds? I am a bit confused by this aspect.&gt;<br>We do run out of funds. Our budget is a real-life limit. But as we construct our budget, we consider the needs and wants of each family member. <br><br>We have an organized budget where we allocate money for bills and savings and spending on certain things, like groceries. There is a finite amount of money and organizing it helps me say yes more. I am more confident saying yes when I am certain I can do so without negative consequences - like coming up short on the bills. <br><br>I keep a budget category for toys, regular activities (like gymnastics), and created a category called &quot;Impulse Activities.&quot; This is my Yes category. It might be fees to go to a science museum, or going out to ice cream; maybe the zip-line course, or a trip to the dollar store. Every pay period, I allocate money to this &quot;Yes&quot; category. Sometimes we spend it all, but often it adds up over a few weeks of the kids wanting to be home and then I have the means to say yes when something fun comes up. <br><br>I keep it all in my phone with an app and this also helps because I can see in real-time if we can do/buy/have whatever has caught our interest. <br>Karen<br></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: need help to view &quot;insatiable&quot; through an unschooling lens","postDate":"1389627601","msgId":73290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzODk2Mjc2MDEuMTM5OTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTE3My1EUzc2N0FBN0FCQjlCRjQwNzA3NkE4MUM0QkMwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PGxhdmxyYStuNGJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkxVMTczLURTNzY3QUE3QUJCOUJGNDA3MDc2QTgxQzRCQzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":73289,"nextInTopic":73291,"prevInTime":73289,"nextInTime":73291,"topicId":73282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223\"><html><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223y_msg_container\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223yiv957332081\"><div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223yiv957332081ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223yiv957332081ygrp-msg\" style=\"\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71534223yiv957332081ygrp-text\"><div><br><div>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Christmas rolled around this year she said she pretty much had \neverything she wanted and had a hard time coming up with gift ideas!&nbsp; She \ndid, of course, manage to come up with a pretty good list (although \nnot&nbsp;overwhelming)&nbsp;and I made sure to get everything on it.&nbsp; When \nit came time to open gifts she was so genuinely satisfied and joyful.&nbsp; At \nthe end she said that she had gotten everything she wanted and more.&nbsp; She \nsaid there was nothing else she could think of that she wanted!&nbsp; I felt so \nproud and satisfied!!&nbsp; She has not asked me for one thing since!&nbsp; We \ntook an excursion to the mall last week for a mother/daughter day, which is \nsomething we&nbsp;started doing periodically&nbsp;when we started unschooling, \nand she knew that I had money in my purse and she could pick out anything she \nwanted.&nbsp; For the first time she had a hard time finding things she really \nwanted &amp; I actually came home with a little money left!&nbsp; For her, those \ntrips to the mall have slowly transitioned from a frantic desire to fill up the \nneed inside of her to a relaxing and enjoyable time that we get to hang out \n&amp; have fun together.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>Ah but you left out something important!

I really liked Sandra&#39;s idea of 75 cents/age, so we used that when we started a few years ago.  My son is eleven now so he gets $8.50/week.  He loves getting upgrades on various servers with that money.  He&#39;ll save for the best upgrades.  I&#39;ve offered to get him a couple myself, but he really likes to use his own money on these.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started asking for gift certificates or money for Ethan&#39;s birthday and christmas gifts from family when asked about what he would like.  Over the holidays, Ethan bought himself a full set of Minecraft action figures with gift certificates from Amazon given to him by family members.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking, Doug and I do our best to get him the things he expresses an interest in.  We both figured that some kind of alternative schooling would likely be a whole lot more than what Ethan asks for.  He actually asks for very little.  I&#39;m usually the one bringing new things into the home to explore.  Maybe surprising your child with things you know she would like before she asks for them would help her feel more full.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you help a child who always wants more.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found it really helpful to avoid using the words &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never&quot;.  I highly doubt that your child always wants more.  Look at when he/she does really want more and find creative ways to meet those needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, make sure to take the time to notice when he/she is satisfied and/or doesn&#39;t want more of something.
