Through my many years, even with people that know us, and the kids, they still can&#39;t believe that the kids make their own decisions.  If there were some kind of discussion about your background, or beliefs, or something - but what I saw was alot of torment and drama.  And it seems to me it is that kind of behaviour that we have really chosen to stay away from, when the family is flowing, communicating and being respectful of each other.<br/>\n <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be grand if there were a series of shows that would tape your own family, and let you answer and explain what you are thinking and how it all works?<br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out AOL.com today.
