Anyhow today I was was wondering how much stuff my kid<br/>\n&gt; actually does for himself and how much he does because he wants<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;please&quot; me - although I try to not give him any indication that<br/>\n&gt; he doesn&#39;t please me, etc when related towards schoolwork etc. How<br/>\n&gt; much planning do you do ahead with your child? Do you try and plan a<br/>\n&gt; few activities for the week or month? Do you input that would he<br/>\n&gt; like to study this topic this week or perhaps he would like to<br/>\n&gt; continue such and such instead? I know some &quot;unschooling&quot; moms who<br/>\n&gt; are doing timelines with their 6yo and everytime they come across<br/>\n&gt; some bit of info the mom puts it on the timeline - so the child will<br/>\n&gt; understand history. But me and my son have discussions about power<br/>\n&gt; rangers and avalanches and if the power rangers were real... Or we<br/>\n&gt; talk about scenarios for new Scooby do games and movies or we<br/>\n&gt; compare kids shows like &quot;kids next door&quot; with real life events and<br/>\n&gt; occasionally we play will a computer game like &quot;totally spies&quot; which<br/>\n&gt; is so teenage girl geared but my ds just loves it although he has to<br/>\n&gt; ask me to explain all of the make-up gadgets - but he still beats me<br/>\n&gt; at the game! I think in fact our current &quot;curriculum&quot; must be<br/>\n&gt; Cartoon Network! The TV and the .net as well!<br/>\n&gt;    Anyhow I&#39;m rambling yet again. So having explained this, if my<br/>\n&gt; son decides to practice writing (for example) do you think he is<br/>\n&gt; doing that for me or actually for himself? Should I just wait awhile<br/>\n&gt; and see if it keeps his attention, should I praise him for doing it?<br/>\n&gt; That would be out of context for me because I wouldn&#39;t praise him<br/>\n&gt; for playing a video game and that&#39;s learning, although when he does<br/>\n&gt; sometime like clear the living room floor I might say someting<br/>\n&gt; like &quot;it looks clean in here, thanks for putting your toys away.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Any of you who have read my previous posts know I do have a problem<br/>\n&gt; with TV - although I am TRYING to not let it show, I was just always<br/>\n&gt; raised that there are so many other things you could be doing in<br/>\n&gt; real life instead of watching others on the tube. SO especially<br/>\n&gt; cartoons I grow tired of quickly, but I allow my son to watch all he<br/>\n&gt; wants, and I try not to berate the TV too much, but I also try to<br/>\n&gt; offer other things to do - which brings me full circle to the<br/>\n&gt; beginning of my post, should we be planning more things to do, what<br/>\n&gt; if all he wants to do he is already doing? And as far as I can<br/>\n&gt; tell &quot;strewing&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything as far as I can tell, he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; holding tight mostly to Cartoon Network, so what am I doing wrong or<br/>\n&gt; should I just lay off? Thankfully he&#39;s not compulsory age yet so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have to keep the journal until starting July 1st  and as you<br/>\n&gt; can tell I am already confused about how I am going to do that.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Moza<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I&#39;ll do a bunch of research about fun stuff we could <br/>\ndo/see, then put the most likely candidates out for choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other terms, I&#39;m not really sure how to read that question. Are you <br/>\nthinking in terms of goals or subjects here? Like sitting down with a <br/>\nchild and talking about what they want to read or do in terms of history <br/>\nor something like that? Maybe you&#39;re not--I don&#39;t know. But if that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat you mean, even if you&#39;re doing it on a relaxed, vague time-table <br/>\nlike &quot;this month,&quot; say, that&#39;s still not getting you to Unschooling. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t ever make plans like that with my kids. We just live, have fun, <br/>\nfollow our interests and the learning happens. I don&#39;t worry about <br/>\nwhether we&#39;ll do things on any given day because we always do things, kwim?<br/>\n<br/>\n====Do you input that would he like to study this topic this week or <br/>\nperhaps he would like to continue such and such instead?====<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I ask a question remotely similar to this is when we&#39;re at <br/>\nthe library. Then, I will ask if there&#39;s anything in particular the kids <br/>\nwant to look for while we&#39;re there. Sometimes there is, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best strewing book I got the last time we were at the library was <br/>\none that hadn&#39;t even been looked at a time or two before: a book on the <br/>\nfolk art of whirligigs and weathervanes. Very cool. Lot&#39;s of beautiful, <br/>\nglossy color pictures of really elaborate whirlygigs--the kinds of <br/>\nwooden things that spin and move in the wind. There were swimmers, row <br/>\nboats, big bands, chorus lines, Santa and his sleigh. Really cool stuff. <br/>\nThe back had some patterns for simple beginner vanes and whirligigs <br/>\nsketched out on graph paper. Lots of great discussions came out of that <br/>\nbook, which captured the attention of my oldest (7) and my youngest (4).<br/>\n<br/>\n====Anyhow today I was was wondering how much stuff my kid actually does <br/>\nfor himself and how much he does because he wants<br/>\nto &quot;please&quot; me - although I try to not give him any indication that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t please me, etc when related towards sHchoolwork etc.  ===<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we just don&#39;t do schoolwork, period. Pretty much nothing we do <br/>\neven remotely looks like schoolwork, though my younger dd (5) has been <br/>\ninterested in the Bob&#39;s Books recently (though I suspect some of that is <br/>\ndh&#39;s influence, grrrr). We do science experiments because dh is a <br/>\nscientist and my kids love them, but they don&#39;t look like schoolwork. <br/>\nThere are no lab books (well, there were lab books that dh brought home <br/>\nfrom work, but they never caught on), no lectures about the scientific <br/>\nmethod, just genuine interest and curiosity and wonder--the real basis <br/>\nfor science before it was formalized into a method.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====I know some &quot;unschooling&quot; moms who are doing time lines with their <br/>\n6yo and every time they come across some bit of info the mom puts it on <br/>\nthe time line - so the child will understand history.====<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about making a time line because we do a lot of <br/>\nhistory--going places like Williamsburg or Plimoth Plantation--and Em <br/>\nloves ancient civilizations. But we&#39;ve never actually started it. I&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about making a chart listing the different gods/ goddesses from <br/>\nGreece, Rome and Egypt, but not for Em, for me because I can&#39;t always <br/>\nkeep them straight. But, these more schooly things rarely materialize <br/>\nand tend to be more fleeting thoughts than anything else. I think that <br/>\nif I were to jump on them and start organizing everyone to do them, that <br/>\nwould probably start being more about me and some educational product <br/>\nthan about the kids. I suspect anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n====Or we talk about scenarios for new Scooby do games and movies or we <br/>\ncompare kids shows like &quot;kids next door&quot; with real life events and <br/>\noccasionally we play will a computer game like &quot;totally spies&quot; which is <br/>\nso teenage girl geared but my ds just loves it although he has to ask me <br/>\nto explain all of the make-up gadgets - but he still beats me at the <br/>\ngame!====<br/>\n<br/>\nEm loves doing this kind of thing. She&#39;s always describing the next Star <br/>\nWars movie that she&#39;ll make or whatever, and we love watching the DVD <br/>\nextras where they show all the story-boarding that went into making the <br/>\nmovie. We&#39;ll do stuff like read a book, then watch the movie, look at a <br/>\ncomic book, looking at all the different adaptations of the story. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t do this often, but when we do it&#39;s fun. We&#39;ve done it with <br/>\nSleeping Beauty, _The Hobbit_ and _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_.  <br/>\nRight now, they&#39;re in the middle of _Stuart Little_ with dh, so we&#39;ll <br/>\nrent the movie when they&#39;re done. I&#39;d like to do it with _James and the <br/>\nGiant Peach_, but that&#39;s just a vague someday kind of thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How can I tell if my child is doing what he wants or I want?","postDate":"1096459375","msgId":20976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkYi4yYmNkZTQ3Ni4yZThiZmU2ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20968,"nextInTopic":20977,"prevInTime":20975,"nextInTime":20977,"topicId":20968,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/28/04 8:25:45 PM, mozafamily@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-638046400\">In a message dated 9/28/04 8:25:45 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mozafamily@...\">mozafamily@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  How much planning do you do ahead with your child?
