It was disheartening to find out how many people came to the session looking for &quot;edutainment&quot; recommendations.  They wanted to know how to use video games to get content into their kids.  I hope that I was able to help some people understand that content is not as important as the skills people can get from playing video games.  Critical thinking trumps memorizing math facts any day (says the former algebra teacher who has a BA in math and still does not know her math facts).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my blog post and the follow up links at the end are able to help those struggling to find value in video games.  Those looking for more information can enter &quot;video games education&quot;, &quot;video games curriculum&quot;, or &quot;video games learning&quot; into an internet search engine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschooling.blogspot.com/2012/10/video-game-curriculum.html\">http://unschooling.blogspot.com/2012/10/video-game-curriculum.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This leads to a blog post based on a presentation given at a homeschooling conference in North Carolina.
