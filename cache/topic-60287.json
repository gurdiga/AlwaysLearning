She is only now, at 13, starting to be able to enjoy playing board games.  She is the kid who would make up ways for competitive games to not have winners and losers.  For example, she decided that in Battleship, it was good to get the holes in your boat filled up, because it repaired the boat and kept it from sinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t that Pearl was a &quot;bad sport,&quot; she just did not enjoy the competitive nature of most board games.  She felt bad for whoever lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I figured that out, here are some of the things we did:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just didn&#39;t play board games, we did other stuff.  I&#39;d offer to play board games with my board game loving son when Pearl was asleep or otherwise occupied.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInvited her, but did not push her to play, ever.  I didn&#39;t want her to feel unwelcome to play, but I didn&#39;t want her to feel pressured to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought of ways to make competitive games non-competitive.  It was creative and fun to do this. This worked with games beside board games too. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, we had a Pokemon birthday party once (Pearl and her brother Cas have birthdays that are four days apart, so they always had one big party together.)  Pearl always disliked party games at birthdays because there were usually winners and losers and prizes awarded. We came up with a list of games and figured out how to make them noncompetitive.  Instead of musical chairs, we had musical squares.  We laid out squares of fabric on the floor.  When the music stopped, you stood on a square; more than one kid could stand on the same square.  We took one square away for each turn, so by the end of the game the kids were all trying to stand on one fabric square.  It was funny and fun and getting everyone on to that one square was something all the kids worked on together to achieve.  We had an obstacle course.  We hid the goodie bags so every kid had to find theirs.  We did a ton of activities, not one of which involved competition.  The kids had a GREAT time and the moms were all saying how nice it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nBought noncompetitive games.  Here&#39;s one good site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.familypastimes.com/index.html\">http://www.familypastimes.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNot keep score.  We still do this.  We play Apples to Apples until we feel we&#39;ve had enough.  We don&#39;t care who has the most cards at the end.  We play Whoonu but we don&#39;t add up our chips at the end.  Pearl and I play Scrabble or Boggle without keeping score. Lots of games can be played without keeping score.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of our best family times together have been doing things that we made up or found out about while trying to come up with noncompetitive games and activities. &quot;Hide with the hider&quot; is one great example.  We play this on winter nights when it&#39;s dark.  One person hides somewhere in the dark house.  The searchers all have flashlights. When you find the person who is hiding, you hide with them, until the last person finds the whole group.  That game has become a family favorite. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat you want to avoid for sure is putting Dravin in situations where there&#39;s a good chance that he might lose.  And I would suggest not talking to him about being a good sport, telling him that not everyone can win every time etc. etc.  I&#39;m not accusing you of doing this; it&#39;s just that that is what I remember hearing when I was a kid, and I think it&#39;s still the conventional response today.  Kids already know they won&#39;t win all the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get bummed out when you lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tina Tarbutton &lt;tina.tarbutton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another issue is the way he reacts when he loses.
