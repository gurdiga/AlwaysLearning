I have an allergy to many sunscreens, and it&#39;s also <br/>\n&gt; really irritating when it gets in my eyes. His anti-sunscreen <br/>\n&gt; reaction seems pretty strong, and he might have a reason for it <br/>\n&gt; that you might not be able to see yet. (When my son was 2 or 3, <br/>\n&gt; he told me he didn&#39;t want to eat peanut butter anymore; I didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; force him to eat it, and it turns out he has a pretty severe allergy <br/>\n&gt; to it now at 11.) It also might be a strong reaction to the daily <br/>\n&gt; hassle/coercion of the application.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Secondly, I wanted to echo what others have said. My four <br/>\n&gt; children are all very blonde and light-skinned. They&#39;ve never had <br/>\n&gt; sunburns (they&#39;ve gotten spots of light pink on occasion) and <br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t wear sunscreen every day or every time they go <br/>\n&gt; outside. (I also live in a much sunnier climate than Denmark.) <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I suggest that they should wear sunscreen. Those <br/>\n&gt; times include days when we&#39;re going to the beach or days when <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re going to be in the pool all day. This is probably a few <br/>\n&gt; times a month, maybe 20 days in the whole year. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There have been a number of times when we&#39;ve been outside all <br/>\n&gt; day at a park, and I&#39;ve been wearing sunscreen and they have <br/>\n&gt; not been; it&#39;s odd when I&#39;m then the one who gets a burn. Unlike <br/>\n&gt; me, they do get tans, which undoubtedly helps protect them <br/>\n&gt; some.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Occasionally, people express surprise that my children have <br/>\n&gt; tans; my theory is that daily application of sunscreen might not <br/>\n&gt; be an ultimately healthy idea. It&#39;s not as though it&#39;s unusual for <br/>\n&gt; health recommendations to swing back and forth. (There was a <br/>\n&gt; story in Monday&#39;s L.A.

Just because a four year old doesn&#39;t understand what  <br/>\nsunscreen is for doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll be a ten year old who refuses  <br/>\nsunscreen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd not all people sunburn as easily as others regardless of the  <br/>\ndegree of fair skin.  Not all skin is just the same.  Some burn  <br/>\nEASILY and others not so much.  I live in New Mexico, and I camp with  <br/>\npeople of all skin tones and some never use sunscreen and don&#39;t get  <br/>\nburnt and some do and still get burnt where they forgot to put it,  <br/>\nand some do out of fear and will never know whether they needed it or  <br/>\nnot.  They let medical and government warnings scare them.  They let  <br/>\nsunscreen advertising run their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s my philosophical advice, involving the principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a practical note, he might more easily let you put sunscreen on  <br/>\nhim if he&#39;s sitting in your lap with his back to your belly and you  <br/>\nput it on without him seeing it coming.  Dentists and dental workers  <br/>\nare great about approaching a mouth with tools without getting in the  <br/>\nway of the eyes.  When my kids were little, the feeling of sitting in  <br/>\nmom&#39;s lap having her  massage their faces was fine.  The other  <br/>\nposition, my hand behind their head and my fingers approaching with  <br/>\nscary stuff coming toward their mouth, nose and eyes was not nearly  <br/>\ncomforting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":289627640,"authorName":"tutalea","from":"&quot;tutalea&quot; &lt;morten@...&gt;","profile":"tutalea","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"sunscreen - when nothing works...","postDate":"1186482275","msgId":30201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5OWg5MytiZGUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30202,"prevInTime":30200,"nextInTime":30202,"topicId":30201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m a member of the group, but I think this is my first real post.
