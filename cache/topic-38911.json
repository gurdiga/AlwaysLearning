Or is there  <br/>\nsomething else?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think maybe the kid pesters him even more because your son is  <br/>\nignoring him (having been told not to be rude, maybe ignoring him is  <br/>\nhis only recourse)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, just tossing out ideas. You said your son wasn&#39;t rude to him  <br/>\nwhen you were with him, but I think you also said he didn&#39;t pay any  <br/>\nattention to him, which could be construed as being rude if the child  <br/>\nwas wanting his attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want to support my child being mean to a younger child who  <br/>\nlooked up to him or her, but at the same time wouldn&#39;t want my child  <br/>\nto feel stuck having to spend very much time with a kid he/she didn&#39;t  <br/>\nenjoy being around. That seems like your dilemma, too, right? So that  <br/>\npart I totally understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie (my 17 yo) has a LOT of young &quot;fans&quot; because she teaches karate  <br/>\nclasses that include a lot of young children. Lots are homeschooled  <br/>\nand are at social activities with us, too. I&#39;ve heard her say, very  <br/>\nsweetly but firmly, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to play this game with you just  <br/>\nONE more time and then you&#39;re going to go play with --another kid--  <br/>\nand I&#39;m going to do something else, right?&quot; She loves the kids, but  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily want to spend hours and hours playing with them  <br/>\ninstead of hanging out with the other older kids. She gets down on the  <br/>\nfloor, looks them in the eye, and says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to play right  <br/>\nnow, but later I will play xyz with you.&quot; And she does. Maybe because  <br/>\nthey have that teacher/student martial arts relationship, too, they  <br/>\nalways seem to accept what she offers. Well, that and she really does  <br/>\nlike them, so I&#39;m sure they can feel that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it doesn&#39;t sound like the younger child is a bully or  <br/>\nanything, I really suggest that you stick to counseling your son how  <br/>\nto handle it himself unless he specifically asks you to do something.  <br/>\nIs HE asking you to do something about it? Is HE even asking you to  <br/>\ntalk to his mother about it? Sometimes kids want to be able to  <br/>\ncomplain, but don&#39;t necessarily want you to take care of the problem  <br/>\nfor them. That&#39;s such a manly thing to want to do, solve the problem  <br/>\nfor your child. He might be better off if you resist that urge,  <br/>\nthough. Anyway - something to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L. Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn L.

Maybe <br/>\nyou should have a meeting with all three of you so that you can both hear <br/>\nout what your son wants with clarity rather than reporting &quot;he said to <br/>\nme...&quot; back and forth, and maybe brainstorm some other ideas for things that <br/>\nhe and your ex can do on the weekends that don&#39;t involve this other boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I discovered that Jayn did not want to play with another unschooled <br/>\nchild, I was lucky to be able to just be straightforward and honest with the <br/>\nother mom. She is a radical unschooler, and very thoughtful about children. <br/>\nShe understood that this wasn&#39;t a criticism of her son, and that I was <br/>\nreally sorry about the situation. She offered to help mediate talking but <br/>\nwas so kind and understanding when Jayn didn&#39;t want to talk over whatever <br/>\nthe problem is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith people who aren&#39;t unschoolers it&#39;s harder. I just gave, I believe, <br/>\nexactly the same advice to try the phrase &quot;not a good fit at the moment&quot; and <br/>\nin this case you can use the age/maturity difference in your favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also told another mom that Jayn and her daughter were &quot;having a hard <br/>\ntime coming to a consensus on what to play&quot;. In that situation I really <br/>\nbelieve that the other girl had just stopped being interested in playing <br/>\nwith Jayn, for whatever unknown reason, and that is why they really couldn&#39;t <br/>\nagree on what to play. The other girl would say that she was &quot;tired&quot; and <br/>\njust lie down not interacting, and Jayn would get bored and frustrated <br/>\ntrying to draw her out. They have been alright in group situations, and that <br/>\nis what I said.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to keep the focus on your son in the conversations rather <br/>\nthan her little boy. &quot;My son is feeling stressed. He&#39;s more of an introvert <br/>\nand needs less socializing...he has enough activities during the week so we <br/>\nneed to pull back a little on the weekend...My son isn&#39;t ready to handle the <br/>\nneeds of a younger boy since he&#39;s still maturing himself...&quot; or the old <br/>\nstandby of simply not choosing to explain yourself at all: &quot;I&#39;m sorry we <br/>\ncan&#39;t make it&quot; and then stop (the hardest thing to do of all!). If the other <br/>\nmother wants more explanation, &quot;It&#39;s a shame we have other commitments, but <br/>\nwe&#39;ll be at [group event] next weekend.&quot; Anyone who demanded to know what <br/>\nthose other commitments are is just plain rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t really control your ex, and you <br/>\ncan&#39;t control the relationship she has with your son. All you can do is make <br/>\nyour best suggestions and support your son when he comes home to his <br/>\nunschooling nest. At least she is not trying to insist he go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I just can&#39;t believe you really  <br/>\nneeded  someone here to say it is okay for your son to decide for  <br/>\nhimself if and when he wants or doesn&#39;t want to play with someone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would that not be completely obvious?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There is a boy in our homeschool group who idolizes my son.<br/>\nUnfortunately, there is a personality clash and my son would prefer<br/>\nnot to play with this boy. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the group is large, he can possibly somewhat avoid him, but if it  <br/>\nis a small group it would be very meanspirited for your son to exclude  <br/>\nthat boy from playing with the group just because he doesn&#39;t like him.  <br/>\nYour son should take other things to do so that he can go off on his  <br/>\nown and get a break from the other boy, perhaps. But, at a homeschool  <br/>\ngroup activity, I think that mostly kids should be asked to be  <br/>\ninclusive. This advice doesn&#39;t apply if there is a serious issue such  <br/>\nas a child being violent or really mean in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; This has been going on for about 4 years now and it&#39;s just not  <br/>\nworking out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince they were 2 and 6 years old?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;For four years this  I&#39;ve told my son he can&#39;t be<br/>\nrude, but I don&#39;t seek out this family or this boy.  But my ex does.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas your son not mentioned to her that he doesn&#39;t like this kid? She  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t care? She thinks he does like him really? She thinks....wait,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother to tell me what you think she thinks...let her come and  <br/>\nask herself, if she wants, though. Again, what she decides to do is up  <br/>\nto her. If she has the same information you have but decides to make  <br/>\nplans that include that family anyway, then either she doesn&#39;t care or  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really believe him or thinks it isn&#39;t that much to ask him to  <br/>\nbe nice to the kid on occasion so that the families can get together.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you think she just needs you to say, &quot;Someone on an unschooling  <br/>\nlist said kids should be able to decide for themselves if they want or  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to play with another kid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he needs more help in how to say he doesn&#39;t want to play right  <br/>\nnow without being rude. Telling him not to be rude might seem, to him,  <br/>\nlike saying he has to suck it up and play with the kid whether he  <br/>\nlikes it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The mom seems to think that the boys can work it out so her son<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get his feelings hurt; IMO there is no way for my son to<br/>\npolitely decline to play with this boy without causing hurt feelings<br/>\nfor both the mom and her son.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really makes no sense. He can say, &quot;I&#39;d like to be by myself  <br/>\nright now.&quot; He can sit and read a book or play with his handheld  <br/>\nvideogame or whatever. What&#39;s so hard or rude about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I guess I don&#39;t see the point of forcing a friendship when<br/>\npersonalities just don&#39;t mesh and I&#39;ve said as much to the mom, which<br/>\ndidn&#39;t earn me any points, to say the least.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve said, more than a few times, &quot;Well, they&#39;re not hitting it off  <br/>\nright now, but maybe they will in the future.&quot; THAT is the reality of  <br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve observed with kids, over and over and over. They may not get  <br/>\nalong now, but in a few months one or both might move into a new  <br/>\ndevelopmental stage or one or the other might develop a new interest  <br/>\nthat appeals to the other. Be realistic and leave the possibility open.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;As an adult I don&#39;t socialize with people I don&#39;t like.  I&#39;m polite,<br/>\nif need be, but don&#39;t seek these people out.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a difference between not seeking them out versus being  <br/>\ntogether at homeschool events and telling the kid &quot;I don&#39;t like you  <br/>\nand don&#39;t want to be your friend now or ever and stay away from me at  <br/>\nhomeschooling group activities.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t get why this mom is so insistent our sons be friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause her son likes yours and my guess is that the daughter likes  <br/>\nyour daughter and the mom likes your ex and so it works out nicely if  <br/>\nonly your son would go along with the program (which he apparently  <br/>\ndoes and then complains to you later). Is the younger child not liked  <br/>\nby others? Has some personality characteristics that are difficult to  <br/>\ntolerate? How often is he stuck playing with him?

Honestly, if the worst  <br/>\nis over-scheduling the child&#39;s social life, that&#39;s pretty lucky. We  <br/>\ncan&#39;t tell, from here, what&#39;s really going on. Maybe Jay is  <br/>\noverreacting because Jay would feel over-scheduled and resentful under  <br/>\nthe same circumstances, but maybe the son is fine. Maybe the son has a  <br/>\nperfectly good time with the other kid and with his social schedule,  <br/>\nbut complains to Jay because he senses that Jay wants to hear him  <br/>\ncomplain about his ex. Who knows? We don&#39;t, but that&#39;s a very common  <br/>\nscenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels like the conversation is about how wrong Jay&#39;s ex is to do  <br/>\nthis to their son, but I don&#39;t see what good that kind of conversation  <br/>\ncan do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us sometimes get stuck in a social situation with someone we&#39;re  <br/>\nnot crazy about because other family members have connections in that  <br/>\nfamily.  I&#39;m not saying to do it on purpose to a kid (for their own  <br/>\ngood). But it naturally happens. I&#39;m hearing that this is an annoying  <br/>\nyoung child who pesters Jay&#39;s son, not a bully who is threatening him  <br/>\nor anything like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say Jay&#39;s best option is to support the child in speaking up for  <br/>\nhimself and making his own wants and needs clear. Maybe do some role  <br/>\nplaying with him on how to handle the annoying child, how to find ways  <br/>\nto enjoy himself. Maybe he could take a book to read or a laptop to  <br/>\nwatch a dvd on or a handheld game to sit and play on his own. I have  <br/>\nthree kids - one is SUPER social and one is very reserved (the other  <br/>\nis in between). So, yeah, the reserved child did end up with over- <br/>\nscheduled social life and spending time with other kids who annoyed  <br/>\nher, but she learned to create her own little oasis for herself  <br/>\nwherever we went.
