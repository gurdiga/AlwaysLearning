I think dh needed to hear, from a voice other than mine, that asserting his own needs is not only ok, it is imperative.  In his family of origin he learned that to have a shot at getting his needs met, his best bet was to try to meet everybody else&#39;s needs first.  He &quot;knows&quot; differently now, but it is easy to get stuck in that old habit.  He said that reading your responses clicked something in his brain and he saw clearly that by ignoring his own needs he isn&#39;t doing anybody much good because when he isn&#39;t sleeping, not only does He feel terrible,  he isn&#39;t able to be fully present - at work, with our children, in our relationship etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe responses also helped me to see that with respect to sleep, we took too big a step too quickly.  This link, recently given in response to a different post, describes it very well:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo many other changes we&#39;ve been making have felt incredibly positive for everyone. I now understand that the gradual nature of those changes, the saying yes *more often,* allowed us all to keep our footing and gently expand our boundaries.  Ds was more excited, happy, and was more wonderfully himself, if that makes sense.  Dh and I felt more connected with our kids, and more on the same page with each other since we now had a clear direction.  We were encouraged and in many moments thrilled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the light of all the other successes we were experiencing with letting go of some of our baggage and watching our children and family flourish, dh and I had faith in the idea of allowing our children to sleep when tired, instead of at a given time.  Perhaps we believed in it on an intellectual level; it made sense to us for our general direction.  But we didn&#39;t take enough time to sort through what would work in our family and how we could get there, nice and easy.  We removed the bedtime boundaries all at once instead of gently expanding them.  Unlike the other moves we had made towards unschooling, we threw ourselves into a crisis managing situation (hence my original post).  We jumped in over our heads, instead of taking comfortable steps on a pleasant journey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter pondering your responses, understanding our misstep has returned me to a greater sense of calm when I didn&#39;t even realize I had been so off balance.  I hope I&#39;m able to hold onto my learning and become more aware of the feeling that warns me when we may have strayed from our pleasant journey toward unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith much appreciation,<br/>\nMairi.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting Enough Sleep","postDate":"1316804850","msgId":63099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTY4MDQ4NTAuNjAwMDAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4NDE3NTM4LTgzNTctNDU0MC05NDg0LTU2RUQxRTBDREMxRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDMxODMxNTM1OS0xMzE2Nzk5NDg1LWNhcmRodV9kZWNvbWJvYnVsYXRvcl9ibGFja2JlcnJ5LnJpbS5uZXQtNzMzODEzMTYxLUBiMjUuYzQuYmlzZTYuYmxhY2tiZXJyeT4gPDc4NDE3NTM4LTgzNTctNDU0MC05NDg0LTU2RUQxRTBDREMxRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63097,"nextInTopic":63152,"prevInTime":63098,"nextInTime":63100,"topicId":63093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  -=-Giving up all the fighting, and regaining the energy that frees up to put to more positive use, is the biggest instant benefit to all.

We are confident in our choice.  What we are struggling with is coping ouselves with their sleep rhythms.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background...ds, now 4.5, has always been a night owl.  As an infant it was a *battle* to get him down to sleep.  If he fell asleep at 8pm, it was always just a nap, never down for the night, and then he&#39;d be up until 2am or later.  Going down for the night was often around midnight, give or take.  Then, when he was 11 months old, he pushed a little later every night until he reversed night and day.  It took about 6 weeks to get him back on a sleep at night rhythm.  Bedtimes continued to be a big struggle and despite our hardest fighting (for it was a fight, not just with him but with events in the day leading up to bedtime), we never got ds to settled for the night at a time conventionally considered &quot;normal.&quot;  10pm was really the earliest he&#39;d sleep.  And keeping it that early required a lot of fancy footwork on our part.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo not surprisingly, the day we did not enforce a bedtime, he returned seemlessly to his night owl self and has actually reversed night and day again.  He goes to sleep around 4 in the morning, later if he naps, and wakes up mid to late afternoon. Dd (2 yrs) tends to follow the family flow, but typically falls asleep and wakes up a couple of hours before ds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an adjustment to be sure, but for us, one worth making.  Giving up all the fighting, and regaining the energy that frees up to put to more positive use, is the biggest instant benefit to all.  But dh and I are now struggling to get enough sleep.  Dh has the hardest time meeting his sleep needs.  He has a 9-6 day job, but feels that ds needs him at night and doesn&#39;t want to or feels like he can&#39;t leave him.  (I tend to sleep with dd, night nursing being a significant factor). Dh catches sleep where he can (a nap after work, or while ds naps from 1-3am) but it is not enough.  I have suggested putting a proper bed in the area where ds likes to stay up so dh can be with ds but get better quality sleep.  We live in a 2 storey house with bedrooms on the 2nd level (where I sleep with dd) and a playroom with TV and video games in the basement (where dh and ds stay up and fall asleep either on the couch or carpeted floor).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t expect ds&#39;s current sleep pattern to last forever, but we also don&#39;t expect it to change anytime soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas of how others have met their own sleep needs with young night owls would be greatly appreciated,<br/>\nMairi.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63140,"nextTopicId":62983}}
