James McKenna, who<br/>\n&gt; has been working on cosleeping from before I heard him speak at the <br/>\n&gt; American<br/>\n&gt; Anthropological Association meeting 12 years ago, has a nice site <br/>\n&gt; reviewing<br/>\n&gt; the long term benefits of co-sleeping:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html\">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html</a> . There is a lot of stuff<br/>\n&gt; there that directly address the problems your MIL seems to be predicting <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; more likely to occur in a cosleeping household. In an exerpt from Our <br/>\n&gt; Babies<br/>\n&gt; Our Selves (which is a wonderful bok that covers cosleeping and<br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding from an evolutionary anthropology perspective) by Meredith<br/>\n&gt; Small (that&#39;s here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.labouroflove.org/babies/co%11sleeping/co%11sleeping-around-the-world-%11-a-cultural-perspective/)\">http://www.labouroflove.org/babies/co%11sleeping/co%11sleeping-around-the-world-%11-a-cultural-perspective/)</a><br/>\n&gt; she has this wonderful quote:  &quot;Seventy-five-year-old Verna Mae Sloane<br/>\n&gt; writes of motherhood in Appalachia: &quot;How can you expect to hold on to them<br/>\n&gt; in life if you begin by pushing them away?&quot;&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ve posted before about your MIL&#39;s critical stance on your parenting<br/>\n&gt; choices. I don&#39;t know if putting together a bunch of resources <br/>\n&gt; demonstrating<br/>\n&gt; that your choices aren&#39;t made in a vacuum, in the absence of research and<br/>\n&gt; careful thought, will be enough to sway her to believe that you are wise<br/>\n&gt; enough to make your own decisions. For whatever reason in your life and <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; relationship with your mother-in-law she has decided, it seems to me, that<br/>\n&gt; you aren&#39;t quite capable enough to operate without her advice or lead. And<br/>\n&gt; maybe before you can expect her to respect you that is something you need <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; address.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the one hand is your mother-in-law, who is an important person to you, <br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve stated, and on the other hand are your children. They shouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; lose<br/>\n&gt; out on because you are afraid of this woman&#39;s opinion. And whatever you <br/>\n&gt; do,<br/>\n&gt; you need to keep them present in your mind in the face of whatever <br/>\n&gt; onslaught<br/>\n&gt; yur MIL produces.

I think that Cosleeping has been addressed on this group<br/>\n&gt;&gt; before so I am bringing a question that has me troubled. I/we co-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sleep w/ our three and 1/2 yr old son and almost 2 yr old daughter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and we are all happy with this practice. My daughter still nurses on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and off all night (only nurses at bedtime and during night as I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; weaned her off daytime nursing). Well... My Mother In Law this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; morning on the phone when I was discussing a totally different<br/>\n&gt;&gt; problem in my life with her, said she had some advice for me that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; she knew wasn&#39;t her business but that she just felt compelled to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; talk to me about anyway. Then she launched into how she thought<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I &quot;just need to get the kids out of our bed&quot; and how &quot;it&#39;s not good<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for the kids nor for your marriage&quot; and how &quot;kids should see that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their parents are a separate unit from themselves and that they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t need to see themselves as part of the marrital unit&quot; (or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something like that?) and how &quot;sleeping with them is more for YOU<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than it is for THEM&quot; and how they&#39;re never going to grow into self<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reliant individuals if I keep them in our bed etc etc etc, yatta<br/>\n&gt;&gt; yatta yatta... As usual, my blood pressure went right up and I just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kept stammering &quot;I&#39;ll give it some thought&quot; etc etc. I never know<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what to say to her when she goes off like that. As you can imagine,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; she is also against homeschooling as well, but that is another<br/>\n&gt;&gt; issue. What do you all say to the naysayers in your lives re:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cosleeping or attachement parenting or whatnot. I&#39;ve asked the same<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sort of question before when she lambbasted me about homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;&gt; being a bad idea... Maybe I should just talking with her? Hard for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me though &#39;cause she&#39;s been more of a mother to me for my whole<br/>\n&gt;&gt; marriage (15yrs) than my own Mom, who I was astranged for like 8yrs.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (yet ANOTHER story).
