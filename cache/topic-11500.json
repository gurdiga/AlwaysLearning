Here&#39;s the biggest <br/>\none:  Please Don&#39;t Worry.  When (not if) he starts reading, it&#39;ll be <br/>\nbecause he has found a really good reason to do it, and that reason <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t be pleasing anyone else (like his mom).  Reading is one of <br/>\nthe great tools to have (like walking and talking), and he&#39;ll get it.  Six <br/>\nyears old is really young!  So is seven.  So is eight.  Since you say he <br/>\nruns from anything that looks like school work, just follow his lead.  And <br/>\nplease don&#39;t worry and don&#39;t watch the calendar.  He&#39;ll emerge as a whole <br/>\nperson if you allow him to, but he&#39;ll may pick up on your worrying, and <br/>\nthat can affect him, too.  Just be with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to tell when reading an email, but I also get the sense that you <br/>\nmay be comparing your son to your daughter (but I could be TOTALLY wrong <br/>\nabout that).   That can change things, too, but I probably don&#39;t have to <br/>\ntell you that.  It&#39;s just something to watch for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s no shortage of stories out there about kids starting to <br/>\nread at a much older age than is acceptable in our society (where 2- and <br/>\n3-year-olds are encouraged to start reading!).  Here&#39;s a link to an essay <br/>\nby Carol Rice that completely eased my mind (I have an 8-year-old son who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t read at all; he&#39;s magical).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps just a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124927644,"authorName":"Alyce - VintageGuitarPro.com","from":"&quot;Alyce - VintageGuitarPro.com&quot; &lt;alyce@...&gt;","profile":"alyce13j","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 677","postDate":"1042017910","msgId":11500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjgwMWMyYjZmOCQ5ZjI1ZTI4MCQ2Y2I5OGRhY0BhbHljZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNDE5NDU5MjMuMzkxLjcxMzM0Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11501,"prevInTime":11499,"nextInTime":11501,"topicId":11500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
