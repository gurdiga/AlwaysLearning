(We don&#39;t actually do punches, just &quot;points.&quot;) Again, Woody spotted the first one and my mind flashed to yesterday&#39;s frustrations that got physical between my boys. I had an epiphany: we had been playing Mario Kart at a friends house and learned about the way to play &quot;Coin Gathering&quot; rather than racing. The idea is that players are on teams (and all human players can choose to be on the same team) and they go around collecting as many coins as they can to add to their team total. I suggested we do this with punchbuggy, to try and spot as many as we can as a family, aiming for a &quot;high score&quot; from one trip to the next.

This audiobook is an exciting approach to raising children that will help you nurture close relationships and solve behavior problems.<br/>\nThink about the loving gaze of an infant, the no-hold-barred embrace of a toddler, the intimacy of a shared bedtime story, or a silent hand-in-hand walk. These moments of heartfelt connection with our children are part of the great payoff for the hard work of parenting. Yet this connection all too often eludes us. We find ourselves locked in battle instead of joined in partnership. Play can be the long-sought bridge back to that deep emotional bond between parent and child.<br/>\n©2010 Lawrence J.

With a timer, they will stretch that time out until the timer dings.  Without one, sometimes they stopped in ten minutes, and it was the turn of the next child in rotation, who could pass, or trade out.  They didn&#39;t &quot;HAVE TO&quot; take their turn.

Both boys have been looking forward to going over the last few days. DH had already booked the tickets and I had plans here at home (which did not include reading lists lol). So, this morning, DH walked in to the boys, who were engrossed in lego, and said &quot;Right boys, let&#39;s go, I want you dressed and downstairs now.&quot; Oooops. L wailed that he didn&#39;t want to go anymore and DH got cross and retreated downstairs leaving L loudly complaining that he was NOT going. I went in to him and the exchange went something like this<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: Would you like to choose clothes for today or shall I?<br/>\nL: I&#39;m NOT going to Cardiff.<br/>\nMe: OK, so what clothes would you like to wear to not go to Cardiff?<br/>\nL: I AM NOT going to Cardiff.<br/>\nMe: OK, so, let&#39;s get you ready to NOT go to Cardiff, hmmmm, let&#39;s get these jim jams off (while gently doing it, and kissing him) and hmmmm I think this top is your favourite not-going-to-Cardiff top, and these trousers are the best not-going-to-Cardiff trousers and (etc til fully dressed) and, now, go and tell Daddy you are ready to NOT go to Cardiff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he scampered off to find DH and I heard him laughingly tell DH that he was ready to Not go to Cardiff. Five minutes later they were skipping happily out the door, DH giving me the hugest look of gratitude ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of exchange is not natural to me (or DH!) and I don&#39;t really understand how it helps my son. In the past I would have tried to use reason (you agreed, it&#39;s booked etc) or persuasion (you&#39;ll love it when you get there etc) or simply got cross.

Specifically, I could have sweetened the pot with a side trip, easily (to the bakery, the library, the downtown square, all on the way--doh!). I could have come up with fun tasks or helper jobs to help him make it to the car. (Just thought of this--when he was a toddler, a gem of a suggestion I got on this list was to pack a yummy &quot;car snack&quot; for that very purpose; I got away from that, but am definitely going to revive it.) I could have given him some time and space to calm down once things were getting heated up at the computer. I could have recognized that after the &quot;time to go&quot; point was resisted, offering to help find the pause button or to give 2 more minutes, etc., was going to do more harm than good and would contribute to overall frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that leads me to the place where I&#39;d like some help understanding the quotes above. I clearly (clear to me now, anyway--thank you!) missed some opportunities to help things go a lot smoother today. But some days, I do remember them, and we still get to the stuck place. Not for as long, and it doesn&#39;t usually carry on into the car, but sometimes there is still some ugliness about getting off the computer when it&#39;s time to switch gears.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove, where Sandra said he should have paused the game, and he definitely should not have started a third game, I thought to myself, &quot;I know!

That&#39;s the main question I remain with after reading the responses. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can and will start earlier with my efforts to ease us through transitions that I know to be tough for Woody. And I&#39;ll really, really work my tactics that have worked in the past, and try viewing the whole conflict from a different perspective, especially when I feel myself getting stuck, too. But if, despite my efforts, I am again standing at the doorway with one child strapped in the car and the other child still on the computer and yelling that he&#39;s not going to get off and he&#39;s going to do some ugly thing to me if I try to get him off, then what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again. Please know I am not trying to back-door my way into justifying computer limits or coercion or anything like that. And I&#39;m not borrowing trouble from a scary what-if, either (at least not intentionally).

Yee-ow! Was it a tough couple of hours before that! I&#39;m baffled, and I&#39;d love some fresh eyes on our situation and any help seeing what could make it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made waffles together this morning for breakfast. It was terrific. Woody read out the recipe to us and we each took jobs. Everybody ate their fill and then some, happily.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the rest of the morning, we (Woody, me, and my other son, who&#39;s 3 1/2) played puppets and dress up, with the 6 1/2 year old bouncing between playing with us and playing on the computer. He was a little annoyed when, he said, I &quot;wasn&#39;t paying attention.&quot; It seemed to me that he liked it best when I was directing the play, telling the story, giving characters their lines, etc., but my younger son likes to do some of that, too, so I was trying to step back and let the play unfold between them, also. I&#39;d characterize the morning of playing as fun with a few moments that were tense.<br/>\n<br/>\nLunch, again, was good. He paused his computer game for green salad with boiled eggs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch, we were supposed to bring an historic re-enactment costume up to my husband at work. (He needs it for an engagement this evening, but walks to work, and so didn&#39;t want to carry it.) We were also going to bring him up a lunch. Woody didn&#39;t want to get off the computer to go. We tried to problem solve a bit, talking about how much time he&#39;d need to finish up, whether the game could be paused or minimized, etc. But there was a kind of manic energy there, and he started to get angry talking about it. Then, as we were talking, he quit the one game and started a new game, one that didn&#39;t have a pause feature, and got really ugly about us all staying home. He said he would hit me, slam the door on me, etc.--threats--if I tried to stop him from playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first point of bafflement. I was right there with him, offering short, simple solutions and lots of leeway (it&#39;s not like we had to leave that second to bring my husband up his things), and yet, there was still this angry pushback. Pushback against what, I wondered? I was surprised he was feeling so much resistance to what seemed, to me, like a pretty low-pressure, solution-based conversation, which is the norm for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did end up leaving--he found the pause feature after all, or maybe he started a new game that had a pause--which, like magic, evaporated all his anger. He was totally fine getting in the car then. But in the car, he and his brother started playing punchbuggy, and he got angry again. His brother, being 3 1/2, doesn&#39;t really understand the game and so calls out punchbuggies randomly. This infuriates Woody. We&#39;ve talked about the differences between 3 1/2 and 6 1/2, but in the moment, it&#39;s hard for him to see it. The game, overall, has becoming hard for us because if anyone else gets a point ahead of Woody, he wants to negate their sighting and frustration builds. After a moment of them going back and forth about cheating or not, Woody started hitting his brother across the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is typical for some kids, but it&#39;s not for mine. He doesn&#39;t usually act like this toward his brother. I pulled in to where we were meeting my husband, and while we were getting the transfer sorted out, the little one fell asleep. Still, Woody was angry. After my husband left, I asked him if he wanted to just come sit in the front seat and hang out, maybe listen to some music. He did. He sat with me for a few minutes, then he spotted my crochet basket. He asked if he could do some crochet, and I said sure, so we did that for a while, sweetly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a couple of more incidents of ebbs and flows, later this afternoon and over the last couple of days, but I think this gives a pretty good snapshot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe describes what&#39;s happening like this: &quot;I get angry about X, and then I feel this really big energy, and I yell/punch/kick.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis behavior is So Big and So Atypical that I&#39;m suspecting it&#39;s some sort of growing pains or developmental phase or some other such thing that is governed by changing chemistry. Very little else in our life has changed recently, and I&#39;d describe the month leading up to this as pretty darn smooth. But he had a stage like this around 4, too, also triggered by transitions and challenges (such as the win/lose idea of playing games). It&#39;s resistance turns into anger turns into big anger and threats and then physical reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you think? And what helps? I am finding that strong, physical affection is well received--holding him in a tight hug, scooping him up like a baby in my lap and holding him close, filling him up with cuddle time even before he gets out of bed in the morning. But, in the moment, it feels like walking on firecrackers. I&#39;d like to be more effective and graceful at helping him through this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading, and for any insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66643,"nextTopicId":66788}}
