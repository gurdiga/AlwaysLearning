Usually she ends up<br/>\nsearching for particular colors, such as the stripes on a shirt or the<br/>\nparticular flowers or the roof tiles. Whatever seems to be distinctive. She<br/>\nplays around putting them together. Then she will generally wander off and<br/>\nlose interest until the puzzle is close to being done. She will return to<br/>\nput in the last few pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fastest way I know to DIScourage her involvement in any activity is to<br/>\ntell her how to do it - even gently directing her process will cause her to<br/>\njust stop and go away.

That you and dh get to do the puzzle together, or<br/>\nthat it be a shared activity? If you and your dh find it too frustrating to<br/>\nshare the puzzle with your kids and their more anarchic approach, I suggest<br/>\nthat you get more puzzles so that they can do their own near you. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust let them do it in their own ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Friends and I were talking about putting <br/>\ntogether puzzles, and someone mentioned how kids should be taught to do the outsides <br/>\nfirst, follow the picture on the box etc. I must admit that we did that with our oldest, and he <br/>\nhates puzzles. I feel that his personality doesn&#39;t lend itself to doing puzzles anyway, but I <br/>\nhate to think that micromanaging his puzzle technique didn&#39;t help ;-)  Is it truly a <br/>\ndevelopmental stage that people reach, or do people put puzzles together differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when my hubby and I do a puzzle, we always spend set-up time turning all the pieces <br/>\nover, separate the border pieces, put those together...so if the kids are involved, how should <br/>\nwe handle it. I mean, it&#39;s an activity that we start, and we&#39;re doing it our way, but when the <br/>\nkids come up, they just go at it willy-nilly. So, how do we respect their need to experiment <br/>\nwith puzzling, when there&#39;s a thousand pieces scattering everywhere? There has to be a spot <br/>\nin the middle. What do ya&#39;ll do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for ideas...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23647,"nextTopicId":23884}}
