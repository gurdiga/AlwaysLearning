We&#39;re learning hiragana (Japanese writing system).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the hiragana characters also, the &#39;brush strokes&#39; have a conventional sequence that&#39;s taught in Japanese schools, but I figured it was something only a teacher in a classroom would make a fuss about and have ignored that and I&#39;ve been writing the characters in whatever way has come to me automatically. Patrick, perhaps from being very used to doing things his way, has done the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nI write left handed and he&#39;s right handed. We noticed that we constructed many of the characters using a different sequence of &#39;strokes&#39; - but it seemed that the difference came mainly from me starting at the top and him starting at the bottom. That got us into a conversation about how we each wrote the letters of the English alphabet, so we put that to the test by writing out the 26 letters in upper case and lower case and comparing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome interesting findings. Pat wrote most of his letters bottom to top. I think from memory it was 35 of 52. There were six letters that we *both* wrote from the bottom in upper case - A, M, N, O, Q, and X; only two letters in lower case - o and x. With the exception of N, the upper case letters I start from the bottom I also write right to left (Pat writes them left to right); and *all* my &#39;crossbars&#39; - in the letters E, F, H, J, T, f, and t - I write right to left. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat comes from me learning to write in school way back in the 1950s with a nibbed pen dipped in an inkwell - and being left handed. Which meant I had a problem with smearing what I&#39;d just written.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout my primary (elementary) school years in fact and into my high school years, I had an almost permanent ink stain along the edge of my left hand from smearing my written work. To reduce the smearing as much as possible, I learned to curl my arm around the top of the page and arch my wrist - a very awkward way of writing that became a habit into my adult life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nibbed pens were eventually superseded by fountain pens, which was an improvement if not a solution, but it was still fountain pens only. Ballpoint pens were banned. They were thought to be detrimental to good penmanship. Ballpoints became an option at my high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 16, after I&#39;d left school and got a job as an &quot;Office Junior&quot; (does that role exist any more?), my new colleagues would often remark on the peculiar mechanics of how I wrote. One day, after I had been graduating from doing less filing and making pots of tea to more clerical work, my manager commented on how tiny and difficult to read my handwriting was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I learned to write all over again. With a ballpoint pen. Practising writing the individual letters over and over (like I&#39;m doing with the hiragana now). Since then, my writing has been bigger and more legible and it&#39;s also non-cursive. I only run letters together if I&#39;m writing quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s handwriting is also non-cursive, very much that of somebody who hasn&#39;t done a lot of handwriting over the years but whose style has come from his own mind outwards.
