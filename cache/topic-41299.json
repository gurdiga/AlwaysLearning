The<br/>\npercentage of the school-age population that was home-schooled<br/>\nincreased from 2.2% in 2003 to 2.9% in 2007. &quot;There&#39;s no reason to<br/>\nbelieve it would not keep going up,&quot; says Gail Mulligan, a<br/>\nstatistician at the center.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditionally, the biggest motivations for parents to teach their<br/>\nchildren at home have been moral or religious reasons, and that<br/>\nremains a top pick when parents are asked to explain their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2003 survey gave parents six reasons to pick as their motivation.<br/>\n(They could choose more than one.) The 2007 survey added a seventh: an<br/>\ninterest in a &quot;non-traditional approach,&quot; a reference to parents<br/>\ndubbed &quot;unschoolers,&quot; who regard standard curriculum methods and<br/>\nstandardized testing as counterproductive to a quality education.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We wanted to identify the parents who are part of the &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>\nmovement,&quot; Mulligan says. The &quot;unschooling&quot; group is viewed by<br/>\neducators as a subset of home-schoolers, who generally follow standard<br/>\ncurriculum and grading systems. &quot;Unschoolers&quot; create their own systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe category of &quot;other reasons&quot; rose to 32% in 2007 from 20% in 2003<br/>\nand included family time and finances. That suggests the demographics<br/>\nare expanding beyond conservative Christian groups, says Robert<br/>\nKunzman, an associate professor at Indiana University&#39;s School of<br/>\nEducation. Anecdotal evidence indicates many parents want their kids<br/>\nto learn at their own pace, he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nFewer home-schoolers were enrolled part time in traditional schools to<br/>\nstudy subjects their parents lack knowledge to teach. Eighteen percent<br/>\nwere enrolled part time in 1999 and 2003, compared with 16% in 2007.<br/>\nKunzman says this might be because of the availability of online<br/>\ninstruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2007 estimates are based on data from the Parent and Family<br/>\nInvolvement in Education Survey of the National Household Education<br/>\nSurveys. Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research<br/>\nInstitute, says the estimates are low because home-schooling parents<br/>\n&quot;are significantly less likely to answer government-sponsored surveys.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41292,"nextTopicId":41267}}
