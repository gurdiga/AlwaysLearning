I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m<br/>\nactually wrong about this, but I don&#39;t think so.

My<br/>\ndaughter seems to really enjoy this little girls company so mostly<br/>\nthey play here.  But sometimes the father feels his daughter spends<br/>\nto much time here and they should play at his home.  Today my<br/>\ndaughter played at their house.  When she came home she was quick to<br/>\ntell me, the father spanked her and A.  &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My daughter says, &quot;We were pretending to be zombies, with dry scaly<br/>\nskin, and when we said AHHHH!  the little sister pretended to be<br/>\nscared so she screamed.&quot;  At this point the father told them to &quot;Stop<br/>\nscaring the little sister.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I asked my daughter if they were trying to scare the her.  She says<br/>\nthey were not and that she was laughing and playing with them.  Well<br/>\nthey continued to play and the little sister screamed again to which<br/>\nthe father said I told you to stop then spanked my daughter and her<br/>\nfriend and warned them if they did it again he was going to &quot;get the<br/>\nbelt&quot;.......<br/>\n<br/>\n  Breathe........breathe.....breathe.....(talking to myself here)..<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is no question that I will be speaking to this man. But it<br/>\ncould be more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I am looking for are your suggestions.  I see this as (maybe)<br/>\nan opportunity to speak to this man about other options in<br/>\nparenting. By the way, his wife is a doll and I really like her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You see his child, of all my childrens friends, (I have four<br/>\nchildren)is by far the worst behaved.  I know it is because of his<br/>\noppression.  The very issues he has the tightest rules on in his home<br/>\nare the very same things she takes advantage of in my home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  An example is food.  Food is tightly regulated in their home,<br/>\nwhere they eat, how much, and not a bit is to be wasted EVER.  So in<br/>\nmy home she is always wasting food, by that I mean taking way more<br/>\nthen she can eat then throwing it away.  Manners are strictly<br/>\nenforced in her home, when she is here you would hardly know she had<br/>\nany.  These are small examples (there are more) but proof that the<br/>\nfather is creating the exact opposite of what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you think it is possible for me to help this family and in doing<br/>\nso help my daughters friend?  Or should I just deal with the spanking<br/>\nissue and continue to set an example of how life can be different and<br/>\njoyful with children. I know he sees the joy my family has.<br/>\n<br/>\noh, my dd Elaine is 7 almost 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cally<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

But three times <br/>\nshe just walked and came home because the uncle (who was really the more <br/>\nattentive and better caregiver) was making her scared or nervous by being <br/>\nirrational and lame.

She says<br/>\n&gt; they were not and that she was laughing and playing with them.  Well<br/>\n&gt; they continued to play and the little sister screamed again to which<br/>\n&gt; the father said I told you to stop then spanked my daughter and her<br/>\n&gt; friend and warned them if they did it again he was going to &quot;get the<br/>\n&gt; belt&quot;.......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Breathe........breathe.....breathe.....(talking to myself here)..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So there is no question that I will be speaking to this man. But it<br/>\n&gt; could be more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   What I am looking for are your suggestions.  I see this as (maybe)<br/>\n&gt; an opportunity to speak to this man about other options in<br/>\n&gt; parenting. By the way, his wife is a doll and I really like her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You see his child, of all my childrens friends, (I have four<br/>\n&gt; children)is by far the worst behaved.  I know it is because of his<br/>\n&gt; oppression.  The very issues he has the tightest rules on in his home<br/>\n&gt; are the very same things she takes advantage of in my home. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   An example is food.  Food is tightly regulated in their home, <br/>\n&gt; where they eat, how much, and not a bit is to be wasted EVER.  So in<br/>\n&gt; my home she is always wasting food, by that I mean taking way more<br/>\n&gt; then she can eat then throwing it away.  Manners are strictly<br/>\n&gt; enforced in her home, when she is here you would hardly know she had<br/>\n&gt; any.  These are small examples (there are more) but proof that the<br/>\n&gt; father is creating the exact opposite of what he wants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Do you think it is possible for me to help this family and in doing<br/>\n&gt; so help my daughters friend?  Or should I just deal with the spanking<br/>\n&gt; issue and continue to set an example of how life can be different and<br/>\n&gt; joyful with children. I know he sees the joy my family has.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; oh, my dd Elaine is 7 almost 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Cally<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
