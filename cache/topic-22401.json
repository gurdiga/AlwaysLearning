Hollyhock grows on a tall stem and the leaves are  kinda <br/>\nrough and dry, a little like sandpapery geraniums.  The first year  they hardly <br/>\ndo anything.  They&#39;re dinky little plants.

I don&#39;t know you, but because you are a person on this<br/>\nearth I respect you. However, I have no intention of respecting *ideas* that<br/>\n*I* think are not good for children. It has nothing to do with you. When you<br/>\nsay something like &quot;we don&#39;t like witches and such&quot; or whatever the lead in<br/>\nthought was, it sparked a conversation about censoring and control. That<br/>\nhappens to also be part of your religion too, I&#39;m guessing. Those ideas are<br/>\nones we work with often on this list and every other unschooling list I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen. We are all to some degree consciously letting go of over control and<br/>\nover censoring so that our children can breathe and be the intelligent and<br/>\nbright people that they are. This doesn&#39;t mean that they can throw rocks<br/>\nthrough windows and call people nasty names (unless of course its deserved<br/>\n;-), but it does mean trusting that they will make good choices (and they<br/>\ndo) given all the information available, maybe even info about witches and<br/>\nsorcery.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all on our different journeys through life, and are where we are<br/>\ntoday because that is where the journey has lead us. And the journeys<br/>\ncontinue. So I hope that this list helps in sharing more information about<br/>\ntrusting our children, respecting their abilities to make good decisions,<br/>\nand how to be the best parents that we can be in that process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have many Christian friends, good friends, in fact my husband&#39;s best<br/>\nfriend just left here after spending a week with us. He&#39;s an evangelical<br/>\nChristian. I say the same things to him that I have said on this list about<br/>\nthe *ideas* of his religion. I love *him* though. He may be an oddity though<br/>\nbecause he is the only Christian friend that I can truly say what I think<br/>\nand he doesn&#39;t drop us. Of course he&#39;s also open with the fact that he will<br/>\nalways continue to try to save us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not mean to offend you in any way Julie. I just wanted to share that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think *you* are being disrespected, but ideas that discourage radical<br/>\nunschooling will be disrespected on this list. The intent is to present<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Julianna<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 15, 2005 10:54 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: literary categorization (was something<br/>\nelse)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;If one&#39;s faith is strong and good and useful and true, it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>shouldn&#39;t be endangered by any book or movie or song or art.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n...and as a parent, knowing my child&#39;s body is strong and healthy,<br/>\nstill would not allow her eat something that &quot;I&quot; believe might contain<br/>\npoisons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
