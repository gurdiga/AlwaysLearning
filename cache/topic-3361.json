Then I was calling all my girl scout parents (thank<br/>\ngoodness for DSL, always on! &lt;g&gt;) to get their cookie counts for the<br/>\npre-order, and reading and writing posts. Then I was talking to Brit about<br/>\nwhy the light bulb in her battery-operated Mike (from Monsters Inc) necklace<br/>\nwasn&#39;t necessarily green, it might be a filter in there somewhere, and<br/>\nreading and writing posts. And then Wally took her off with a lamp and a<br/>\npile of filters-on-the-go (clothes, mostly &lt;g&gt;) to make light change color,<br/>\nand I continued reading and writing posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days, we&#39;re out of the house all day. Just luck. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry, this time in two weeks we&#39;ll probably be getting people posting<br/>\nnotes saying, &quot;Is this thing working?
