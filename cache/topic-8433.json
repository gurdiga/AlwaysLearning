Of course now they&#39;re dead...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to guzzle all that water, expert says<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Maggie Fox<br/>\n<br/>\nWASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Trying to do the &quot;right&quot; thing by drinking <br/>\neight full glasses of water a day may do little more than make a person run <br/>\nto the bathroom, a researcher said on Friday.<br/>\n<br/>\nNewspaper articles, health and beauty magazines all advise drinking at least <br/>\n8 full glasses of water a day totalling 64 ounces (two litres) for optimal <br/>\nhealth -- an approach called &quot;8x8&quot; by proponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Dr. Heinz Valtin of Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire said there <br/>\nis no scientific evidence to back up this advice, which has helped create a <br/>\nhuge market for bottled water.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;After 10 months of careful searching I have found no scientific evidence <br/>\nthat supports &#39;8x8&#39;,&quot; Valtin, who has written textbooks on the subject of <br/>\nhuman water balance, said in a telephone interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting in the American Journal of Physiology, Valtin, a kidney specialist, <br/>\nsaid people forget that the food they eat also contains some water.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council has recommended <br/>\nthat people take in about one milliliter of water for each calorie of food <br/>\neaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds up to two liters, or 74 fluid ounces on an average 2,000-calorie <br/>\ndiet. But the National Research Council also noted that much of this is <br/>\nalready contained in food.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I did 43 years of research on that system -- the osmoregulatory system. That <br/>\nsystem is so precise and so fast ting the loss of water through the skin, <br/>\nValtin said. Thirst kicks in long before dehydration starts, he added.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It does it very quickly and very accurately and it does so in minutes,&quot; <br/>\nValtin said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he and colleagues became concerned after seeing dozens of newspaper <br/>\nand magazine articles urging people to sip water all day. &quot;I started talking <br/>\nto my colleagues and asking them &#39;Do you know of any evidence for this?&#39;. <br/>\nInvariably, they said, &#39;No I think it&#39;s a myth&#39;,&quot; Valtin said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe journal asked him to review all the scientific studies he could find and <br/>\nhe concluded that someone misinformed has been telling people to drink large <br/>\namounts of water when most do not need to.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am referring to healthy adults in a temperate climate leading a largely <br/>\nsedentary existence,&quot; Valtin said. &quot;Persons with certain diseases must have <br/>\nlarge volumes of water -- kidney stones are probably the most common example.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest can just drink enough to slake thirst -- and this includes coffee, <br/>\ntea, and even beer -- despite their diuretic effects, Valtin said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe hopes people will be relieved of the guilt of not getting enough water, <br/>\nand of the expense of buying bottled water to drink throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is also the possibility that if you drink a lot of water that happens <br/>\nto be polluted then of course you get more pollutants,&quot; Valtin said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then there is the inconvenience of constant urination, the embarrassment of <br/>\nhaving to go to the bathroom all the time,&quot; he added.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd overdoses of water can cause water intoxication that can lead to <br/>\nconfusion and even death. Water intoxication is one deadly effect of taking <br/>\nthe drug Ecstasy, for instance, because it makes people thirsty beyond their <br/>\nphysical needs.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8459,"nextTopicId":8352}}
