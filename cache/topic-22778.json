It<br/>\nwas usually about 50 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters high, and its<br/>\nopening did not permit visual or tactile contact with the<br/>\nuncloistered. Messages or food were put into the cylinder, then the<br/>\nrota was revolved so that the opening faced the other side. Monks were<br/>\nstationed close by or were notified that someone had turned the wheel<br/>\nby various mechanisms. In some cases, especially at night and in<br/>\nwinter, the rota was filled by the monks with food, and left there for<br/>\nthe poor, to give them something to eat without them having to ask.<br/>\nThe rota was also used by those mothers who didn&#39;t want to (or<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t) keep their (often illegitimate) newborn babies. They left<br/>\nthem in the safe hands of monks or nuns, their anonymity being<br/>\nguaranteed by the rota.

(She hates to do these <br/>\nthings.) She gets 5 points for sweeping the kitchen each day. <br/>\nShe can earn points by cleaning. She looses points if she leaves <br/>\na mess behind her that I have to pick up.**<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine a husband who decided to share what he earned by <br/>\ngiving his wife 10 points for each meal she cooked, 25 points for <br/>\neach room that was spotless and took away 10 points if a child <br/>\nwas crying when he walked in the door, took away 5 points for <br/>\neach thing he had to put away himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think he should write a book on how to build a great <br/>\nhusband and wife relationship? It sounds more like a recipe for <br/>\n&quot;How to get your wife to do what you want her to do.&quot; (And it <br/>\nactually might work for a woman who was raised so poorly that <br/>\nthat seems like good treatment!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something else that has fostered a good relationship <br/>\nwith your daughter and I think it&#39;s working *in spite of* the<br/>\npoints. <br/>\nI think it&#39;s something that you aren&#39;t even aware of in how<br/>\nyou <br/>\ntalk to her, how you interact with her, how you treat her.<br/>\n<br/>\n**It doesn&#39;t hurt to offer her part of what I am earning. I think it <br/>\ngives her some ownership over what I&#39;m doing. When we work <br/>\nthe B&Bs she sets tables and works with me in the kitchen <br/>\nasking me frequently, &quot;Can I do that?&quot; or &quot;What can I do?&quot;**<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system you&#39;ve described with the points doesn&#39;t lead to<br/>\nkids <br/>\nwho happily help. If other parents tried what you&#39;ve described <br/>\nthey won&#39;t get the results you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither<br/>\n<br/>\n1) there is something in your interaction with you daughter (how <br/>\nyou talk to her, how you problem solve with her) that makes her <br/>\nfeel like part of the team working towards a mutual goal, or<br/>\n<br/>\n2) her personality dictates that she&#39;d be that way unless your <br/>\ninteraction with her were very crushing.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you understand what has created a good relationship <br/>\nwith your daughter and why it works and how it can work for <br/>\nothers it won&#39;t help others build good relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most parents parenting is a crap shoot. They hear about <br/>\nsomething that sounds good and they try it out to see if it will <br/>\nwork with their family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost homeschooling lists work that way, people trade ideas that <br/>\nwork for them and others try them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list works differently. First this list isn&#39;t focused on<br/>\nsmooth, <br/>\nefficient running families. It&#39;s about building good<br/>\nrelationships <br/>\nwith our kids. That&#39;s the primary goal and everything else is <br/>\nsecondary. Second it&#39;s figuring out *why* something builds good <br/>\nrelationships with kids and articulating it in a way that others can <br/>\nfigure out how to make it work in their own families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many people imaging life with kids will be like you <br/>\ndescribe with the kids naturally understanding how important the <br/>\nadult&#39;s work/ideas are and the kids pitching in to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut reality is different! ;-) An artistic free-spirited child<br/>\nisn&#39;t going <br/>\nto &quot;just understand&quot; a parent whose high priority is a neat<br/>\nand <br/>\norderly home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for a person to put aside their own immediate wants to <br/>\nhelp someone else out they need to feel that their wants and <br/>\nneeds are important to others. If someone feels they need to <br/>\nfight to get their wants and needs met they are unlikely to put <br/>\naside the fight to help someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter feels her wants and needs are just as valuable <br/>\nto you as yours are, its because of something else you&#39;ve done, <br/>\nnot because you&#39;ve handed out points. It&#39;s something else, <br/>\nsomething in your interaction with her that you&#39;re taking for <br/>\ngranted that&#39;s working.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197017321,"authorName":"Tracey Inman","from":"&quot;Tracey Inman&quot; &lt;traceyi@...&gt;","profile":"tracey_inman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Chores","postDate":"1122425470","msgId":22803,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PElQRURJT0lIQlBDR0RJSkdDREZDR0VJQ0NBQUEudHJhY2V5aUBzY2NvYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjIzODgyNzEuMzEzLjc3NjQxLm0xOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22802,"nextInTopic":22804,"prevInTime":22802,"nextInTime":22804,"topicId":22778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... interrupt the flow of her day?

She entertains herself by reading or she helps me out if she can. 100 points is equal to 100 pesos (10 dollars). For me it costs less to pay her like this than it would cost to have a sitter and she prefers to be with me. She spends points in several ways. She can spend 5 points to have a coke, chocolate candy or other treat. She can also cash her points in for pesos to spend or put in her piggy bank or bank account. She is saving for a video camera and her ticket to France. She really, really wants to go to France. That isn&#39;t something in my budget, but since I&#39;m not paying a<br/>\n sitter, she chose to save some money that way. I said ok I&#39;ll pay my ticket then.

I am usually a<br/>\nlurker but just felt like sharing today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have really evolved with this chore thing.  As a child, my whole life was<br/>\na &quot;have to&quot;.  If I didn&#39;t do x and x then I was restricted or told what a<br/>\nbad person I was in so many terms.  I never had chores per say for our girls<br/>\nuntil we started homeschooling.  I was the one who ordered the &quot;best<br/>\ncurriculum&quot; and set up a chore chart.  (UGH, makes me cringe just telling<br/>\nya&#39;ll about this!)  Once our girls got to the age of 4 or so we always gave<br/>\nthem some sort of allowance so they could have money of their own and make<br/>\npurchases or save.  When we pulled our girls out of school the chore chart<br/>\nbecame their way of making money.  No allowance just paid for the chores<br/>\nthey did.  The rule was dh and I would pay for needs and the girls paid for<br/>\nwants.   Shortly after we began homeschooling we had to move.  We went<br/>\nthrough about a year of living with our parents.  It was during that time I<br/>\nfound unschooling.  And that is when the paradigm shift started.  Luckily my<br/>\ndh and I were on the same page from the beginning.  Of course the worst<br/>\nplace to start unschooling is when you are living with parents whom are/were<br/>\nschoolteachers. Both of our moms have been in the school system for years.<br/>\nMy mom taught 35 years.  My dh and I stayed strong and kept reading and<br/>\ngrowing.  However, during the transition we started just giving our girls an<br/>\nallowance again.  Once we moved into our new home and got settled I had been<br/>\nreading and growing enough to realize I did not want to &quot;make&quot; my girls do<br/>\nanything.  I must admit I would get really frustrated at times going behind<br/>\nthem picking up or cleaning the kitchen.  But I tried really hard not to say<br/>\nanything. (I failed a few times)  I guess the old records I grew up with are<br/>\nstill there and I have to keep them at bay so they don&#39;t jump on the<br/>\nturntable and start playing.  Both our girls really love to save and to work<br/>\ntowards a goal if they have something they really want.  So one day my<br/>\noldest asked me what they could do to earn money in addition to their<br/>\nallowance!  So here&#39;s what we do now...Certain items around the house are<br/>\nworth .50 like cleaning the cat box, unloading the dishwasher, folding<br/>\nclothes, emptying trash, etc. Then depending on things they pick up on<br/>\nthemselves they get more.  For example, yesterday I came home and my almost<br/>\n13yo had vacuumed part of the house, cleaned windows and mirrors, and<br/>\nsomething else I can&#39;t remember.  We talked about a fair wage and came up<br/>\nwith $6.00.  Ended up I owed her $5.50 already so she asked for $6.50 to<br/>\nmake the total even!  Got to love it :) Occasionally the girls will argue<br/>\nover who called the dishwasher or a load of clothes.  They are earning<br/>\npretty good money I must say.  Tomorrow our family is running a concession<br/>\nstand at a horse show and the girls want to help so we will pay them.  This<br/>\nwhole thing has turned into a great way for them to earn money and purchase<br/>\nthose &quot;wants&quot;.  They both have been setting some money aside to open a<br/>\nsavings account.  It has opened the door for some great discussion<br/>\nsurrounding investments, purchases, etc.  I don&#39;t tell them not to buy<br/>\nsomething but will sometimes help them think through it.  Sometimes they buy<br/>\nanyway and later wished they hadn&#39;t, but that&#39;s life.  We have all done some<br/>\nthings like that.  It is just another opportunity to learn.  I suggested<br/>\nthey keep a journal/log of their income and expenditures.  They sometimes<br/>\nwould wonder why they didn&#39;t have as much money as they thought.  So both of<br/>\nthem keep a list of income and how they got it and on the other side they<br/>\nkeep a running log of what they spend and where they spent it.  My almost<br/>\n10yo went on a spending spree one day and spent $43.87.  So she decided to<br/>\nnot spend anything else until she had replaced that amount.  She worked hard<br/>\nand it didn&#39;t take her long before she earned it back.  But in the process<br/>\nof doing this she got a separate piece of paper and at the top put $43.87<br/>\nand every time she earned money she would subtract it from the $43.87 until<br/>\nthe total came to zero.  And people wonder how we do math!  There are some<br/>\nadults that couldn&#39;t keep up with money management the way my girls can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plus for me is I have a lot of help around the house now and everybody<br/>\nis still smiling! :)  Maybe this will help someone else or maybe some of you<br/>\nhave other thoughts that might make this better.....Looking forward to more<br/>\ndiscussion....<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey Inman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11964,"nextTopicId":22800}}
