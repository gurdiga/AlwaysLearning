I&#39;m not new to homeschooling or unschooling. In my later high<br/>\nschool years we became friends with a family of homeschoolers which<br/>\nled us to try it for a short time. I and my younger brothers were sort<br/>\nof homeschooled the year I would have been a senior.  I never did any<br/>\nwork and ended up getting my GED.  <br/>\nWhen my wife became pregnant and our first child was born, we<br/>\ndiscussed homeschooling as basically the only option that we were<br/>\nwilling to consider.  Neither of us were happy with the schooling we<br/>\nhad gotten or the overall experience of schools.<br/>\nI&#39;ve just recently gotten around to reading How Children Learn and am<br/>\nplaying with reading Learning All The Time, though I may need a break<br/>\nfor something a little more fun.<br/>\nI&#39;ve kind of filled my brain the last week or two, reading this board<br/>\nand another local board.  I&#39;ve been reading a lot of stuff on Sandra&#39;s<br/>\nsite as well as all those links.  I&#39;m also in the middle or rethinking<br/>\nmy treatment of my boys in terms of punishment and getting them to act<br/>\na certain way, thanks again to Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve basically got a lot of thinking to do, a lot of personal<br/>\nchange/growth.  I keep seeing the error of my ways in different areas<br/>\nand finding areas in which I&#39;m satisfied with how we&#39;ve been working.<br/>\n I suppose in a sense I&#39;m deschooling, but I don&#39;t really feel that I<br/>\nhave a lot of the hang ups that so many of us have to work on.  My<br/>\nbiggest hurdle is just relaxing, knowing that things will be okay.<br/>\nI would like to say thanks to Sandra because I feel I&#39;ve learned so<br/>\nmuch the last couple of weeks, and so much of this started by<br/>\nstumbling onto her site.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23344,"nextTopicId":23364}}
