I&#39;m also openly grateful to<br/>\n&gt; those who contribute their hard-earned monies to FICA in order for me to<br/>\n&gt; draw upon that fund for our lives (thanks for working so I don&#39;t have to!!).<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve made lots of folks feel much better about that specific deduction as<br/>\n&gt; they now hold a picture in their heads of where that money goes.

I know it can be hard to reconcile in your heart; you have to make<br/>\n&gt; that shift yourself -- I hope you can, your son needs you present without<br/>\n&gt; guilt nor resentment.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m proactive with my family about what we need. What can I do?

My birthday requests are often ones of *family gifts* like<br/>\n&gt; memberships or games. The United Way has a great scholarship program in our<br/>\n&gt; town that we can apply, once a year, to things like art lessons at the local<br/>\n&gt; museum or summer day camp or swim lessons. There is reduced cost for summer<br/>\n&gt; swim passes, classes offered through park and recreation. On super tight<br/>\n&gt; months, I have no qualms calling my mom to let her know we&#39;d like some help<br/>\n&gt; with meals for the rest of the month. Others in my group have offered<br/>\n&gt; end-of-the-month dinners and outings to us on a regular basis. I&#39;ve scrimped<br/>\n&gt; and juggled to get at least one vacation every year. Originally, we would<br/>\n&gt; drive to California to see my in-laws (free room and board) as our annual<br/>\n&gt; trip. I&#39;ve even managed to get us to Disneyland on a pretty regular basis.<br/>\n&gt; Then, in 2004, I just *had to* (my own desire, not a life and death have to,<br/>\n&gt; not a real must ::g::) get to Peabody, MA for the Live and Learn<br/>\n&gt; Conference... That&#39;s all it took!! I was hooked!! From that moment on, I<br/>\n&gt; realized we&#39;d now figure out how to get TWO vacations out of my finances<br/>\n&gt; every year -- Grammas AND Conference! This September will be the 5th<br/>\n&gt; unschooling conference we&#39;ve attended. Again, not easy, I&#39;ve had to swallow<br/>\n&gt; some pride and ask for help -- what I&#39;ve found is that most folks<br/>\n&gt; (especially in this unschooling universe) are willing to do whatever they<br/>\n&gt; can to make this lifestyle possible for anyone willing to take it on. In the<br/>\n&gt; past 12 months, Hayden and I have been on at least 12 roadtrips, some more<br/>\n&gt; than 1,000 miles one way. Thankfully, we&#39;ve got amazing<br/>\n&gt; friends-who-should-be-family all over the country who are willing to host us<br/>\n&gt; for a few days in exchange for our entertaining company (and maybe some<br/>\n&gt; karmic investment).<br/>\n&gt; There are people in my dna family who will no longer speak to me because of<br/>\n&gt; my refusal to *go mainstream* and &quot;just get a job and send Hayden to school&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -- this life, this relationship, this JOY cannot/will not be traded for the<br/>\n&gt; approval of any judgmental you-know-what who wouldn&#39;t be happy no matter<br/>\n&gt; what I did that wasn&#39;t exactly what they did/do.  :::shrug::: We live a<br/>\n&gt; rich, full life.
