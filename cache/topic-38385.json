Where&#39;s the proof that the kids have warped their  <br/>\npersonalities to conform to some ideal?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact some kids purposely dress to shock those who judge by surface  <br/>\nappearance. They want to make people angry because the kids are angry  <br/>\nthat no one cares who they really are. The only real power they&#39;re  <br/>\ngiven is the power to shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is conforming and warping going on, it doesn&#39;t come from an  <br/>\nimage but a pressure and need to conform. Miley would have no  <br/>\ninfluence if the need didn&#39;t exist. Taking away Miley doesn&#39;t remove  <br/>\nthe need, just makes the mom feel better because there isn&#39;t an  <br/>\nobvious external window into what&#39;s going on inside the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is, of course, a natural need to be accepted. Humans are social  <br/>\ncreatures. We need acceptance of who we are. Unfortunately kids grow  <br/>\nup in the school culture where outward conformance often substitutes  <br/>\nfor acceptance and kids can only play act within a limited scope of  <br/>\ncharacters or be ostracized. Some personalities can accept the  <br/>\nostracism as part of their need to not conform. Some personalities  <br/>\nare willing to give up some self expression to have a social circle.  <br/>\nSchool is not a healthy social climate but Miley shouldn&#39;t be blamed  <br/>\nfor what&#39;s been going on well before even her parents were born.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teen years are also a time of trying on various personas to see  <br/>\nwhat they feel like. It&#39;s a teen version of pretending to be Pokemon  <br/>\nand fairies and mommies and daddies. Right now my daughter is trying  <br/>\nout being an 80&#39;s metal guitarist. Is she a sparkly red top and faux  <br/>\nleather pants? It&#39;s shallow and thoughtless to stop there in seeing  <br/>\nwho she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and they don&#39;t feel like they<br/>\n&gt; stack up well in comparison to her and so they develop low self-<br/>\n&gt; esteem<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds plausible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also sounds plausible the sun revolves around the Earth. In fact  <br/>\nyou can see it happen everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere&#39;s the proof that either is true?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the world were as it looks on the surface life would be a whole  <br/>\nlot simpler.

Her mature voice made<br/>\nher an overnight sensation, as well as the youngest female chart<br/>\ntopper in the UK. At a mere 14 years and 316 days old when &quot;You Don&#39;t<br/>\nKnow&quot; hit the top, she was nevertheless a year older than Frankie<br/>\nLymon had been when &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; hit the UK number one<br/>\nslot in 1956.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she was sixteen years old, Shapiro had been voted Britain&#39;s<br/>\n&#39;Top Female Singer&#39;, and when The Beatles had their first national<br/>\ntour it was as her supporting act. The Beatles even wrote the song<br/>\n&quot;Misery&quot; for her but, inexplicably, EMI decided not to record her<br/>\nsinging it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time she was in her late teens, however, her career as a pop<br/>\nsinger was on the wane. Undaunted, she re-invented herself as a<br/>\nperformer in stage musicals, a jazz singer, (jazz being her first love<br/>\nmusically), and more recently a gospel singer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, of course, it&#39;s all more sophisticated and complex and<br/>\nthere are more ways to get into our faces.

If anything, it supports the idea that girls can have<br/>\ncareers, even young girls.  Miley Cyrus hasn&#39;t yet portrayed a &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\nimage for young girls to emulate.  That&#39;s yet to be seen though, as she<br/>\nhasn&#39;t quite launched herself solo of Disney.  Britney Spears wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe a good example of Disney pop iconism, but Christina Aguelera did<br/>\npretty good for herself and remains a talented musician.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Miley Cyrus grew up in Hollywood pop culture, it would stand to<br/>\nreason that she might be a bit more savvy when it comes to her public<br/>\nimage.  Maybe.  So far, that seems true.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux loves Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montanna.  She likes the show, she<br/>\nlikes the music.  Heck, even Chamille likes the newer Miley Cyrus music,<br/>\nand that isn&#39;t her genre at all (plus she&#39;s impressed that Miley Cyrus<br/>\nis friends with Jeffrey Starr IRL).  What Margaux likes most, is singing<br/>\nto her music.  We, as a family unit all like her co-star best of all,<br/>\nthe girl who plays &quot;Lilly&quot;, Emily Osment.  Her brother is a fine actor<br/>\nas well, really awesome in the 6th Sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiley Cyrus looks like a well dressed ordinary girl.  I think that is<br/>\nwhy she is so popular.  Yes, she&#39;s pretty, but not extraordinarily so,<br/>\nlike some pop icon girls.  There is something about her that is both<br/>\nextraordinary and ordinary, that draws girls to her, perhaps it&#39;s the<br/>\ndream of feeling extraordinary.  It seems all little girls want to be<br/>\nthe princess, it&#39;s an old theme that Disney uses often, in varying ways,<br/>\nthis is just a spin off that theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look around me at all the little girls I know, most of them do<br/>\nnot try to emulate Hannah Montanna, they may like her and buy her<br/>\nproducts, but &quot;emulate?&quot;, I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as fighting Disney goes, well, sometimes Disney irritates me,<br/>\nit&#39;s true, but for the most part my kids have all really enjoyed a lot<br/>\nof Disney movies and shows.  It brings up a lot of conversations around<br/>\nhere.  Besides all that, it&#39;s not the only thing out there that kids are<br/>\ninfluenced by.  I think everyone in my family would watch SpongeBob over<br/>\nHannah Montanna most days.  We don&#39;t emulate SpongeBob either.... hmmm<br/>\nthat would be a little scary!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"pre-teen girl stuff","postDate":"1221766204","msgId":38400,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczNjY0MEY5LUIwNEMtNDY1Ny1BQTJCLTM4MEQwRjhBMTE1NEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhdThtbis2M3ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdhdThtbis2M3ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38399,"nextInTopic":38402,"prevInTime":38399,"nextInTime":38401,"topicId":38385,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rosie and I got involved in a discussion with several young men (ages 18/19) about Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus.
