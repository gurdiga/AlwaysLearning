If she were really only a sweet old lady we saw once and it was just me protecting her from my impulsive 4 year old that isn’t murky.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">I don’t see it as just one instance. We have been friends for 15 years and, for me, it’s worth smoothly getting through some uncomfortable moments for the bigger and longer relationship. The hard part isn’t unclarity about whether my son can hit someone, that’s not okay with me. She is asking me to explain why he gets angry and walks away, that’s the part that seems to bother her more. The fact that we see each other so frequently and are friends and neighbors who share so much makes this relationship harder for me to negotiate. It feels very much like a grandparent situation. The solution is not to avoid her, but to keep them both safe through this time that feels prickly and for me murky, because while it isn’t a grandparent, but it is a family relationship that will go on much longer than just a chance meeting.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">My neighbor teases him through a joking commentary on his behavior especially his youthful mishaps and he is very sensitive as the youngest child.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">Sometimes when we’ve been together and my son has been whiney, hungry and tired, she’ll comment “waa waa waa”. This can be at my house, at her house or outside. He spilled crumbs and she commented in a way that she never would have to an adult. She was play growling and making faces the instance when he raised his hand to hit; she was pretending to be vicious. I don’t know if he actually hit her as I was turned the other way, but he raised his arm and got a stern yell. Like you might to a dog. It was all fun and games and then instantly wasn’t.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">I don&#39;t think hitting is okay, but pushing someone until they want to hit, or are close to their edge or crying, isn&#39;t okay either. &nbsp;I&#39;m not out to change my neighbor, and I&#39;m sure my son will find new ways of handling the teasing commentary. The older the children get it seems the less she teases them. My older two sons aren&#39;t as affected by her, or maybe she just doesn&#39;t do it as much with the older boys. It’s like she’s trying for connection and not knowing how to get it. I feel like I need to be there to negotiate their relationship. As my son gets older he will gain skills, but I can’t expect my neighbor to change this behavior.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">Maybe I could be more practiced at telling her “that’s enough”, but I’m not very good at being that direct. THAT feels murky to me. I guess I feel perplexed and judgmental about why someone would be so insensitive to a young person. I don’t want to offend her and risk all the good things we have by saying something that feels scolding, like “That’s Enough!” - oddly it would be much like me saying “No Hitting!” to her, loudly.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">It feels similar to the way siblings don’t mind pushing each others buttons to see how far they can go before a big reaction.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">I also see it sort of like someone who likes to play with cats and kisses them and plays a little rough but doesn’t understand when they fold back their ears and swish their tails and are about to strike.

I don&#39;t think an explanation of my personal theory to her will help. The idea of coaching her the way I coach my children in similar situations (watch how that cat’s tail is swishing) feels odd because she is an adult. I have avoided that. But I know a little time and an older child will help.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">It&#39;s like she thinks he is too sensitive. He should be able to handle the scrutiny maybe. When he walks away that&#39;s when she seems sad and embarrassed. But that&#39;s not her words they are my thoughts about what happened. She might be feeling something else entirely. She does seem like she wants to make it better when he walks away. That&#39;s also the murky part for me, that she looks to me to make it better; I say it just takes time, we can&#39;t make it better right this minute.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">I also don’t want her to sound like a villain who goes around being mean to young children. She is wonderful and much more skilled with older children. She is adventurous and physically fit in a way many grandparents are not, we hike together and garden together, our dogs are best friends, she shares her art studio with my boys and she is a wonderful advocate for our children generally. She just doesn’t have the skills to connect with younger children. I’ve noticed this over the years and so haven’t left younger children in her care without me.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-814738566\">Ahh.

We have been friends for 15 years and, for me, it’s worth smoothly getting through some uncomfortable moments for the bigger and longer relationship. The hard part isn’t unclarity about whether my son can hit someone, that’s not okay with me. She is asking me to explain why he gets angry and walks away, that’s the part that seems to bother her more. The fact that we see each other so frequently and are friends and neighbors who share so much makes this relationship harder for me to negotiate. It feels very much like a grandparent situation. The solution is not to avoid her, but to keep them both safe through this time that feels prickly and for me murky, because while it isn’t a grandparent, but it is a family relationship that will go on much longer than just a chance meeting.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">My neighbor teases him through a joking commentary on his behavior especially his youthful mishaps and he is very sensitive as the youngest child.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">Sometimes when we’ve been together and my son has been whiney, hungry and tired, she’ll comment “waa waa waa”. This can be at my house, at her house or outside. He spilled crumbs and she commented in a way that she never would have to an adult. She was play growling and making faces the instance when he raised his hand to hit; she was pretending to be vicious. I don’t know if he actually hit her as I was turned the other way, but he raised his arm and got a stern yell. Like you might to a dog. It was all fun and games and then instantly wasn’t.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">I don&#39;t think hitting is okay, but pushing someone until they want to hit, or are close to their edge or crying, isn&#39;t okay either. &nbsp;I&#39;m not out to change my neighbor, and I&#39;m sure my son will find new ways of handling the teasing commentary. The older the children get it seems the less she teases them. My older two sons aren&#39;t as affected by her, or maybe she just doesn&#39;t do it as much with the older boys. It’s like she’s trying for connection and not knowing how to get it. I feel like I need to be there to negotiate their relationship. As my son gets older he will gain skills, but I can’t expect my neighbor to change this behavior.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">Maybe I could be more practiced at telling her “that’s enough”, but I’m not very good at being that direct. THAT feels murky to me. I guess I feel perplexed and judgmental about why someone would be so insensitive to a young person. I don’t want to offend her and risk all the good things we have by saying something that feels scolding, like “That’s Enough!” - oddly it would be much like me saying “No Hitting!” to her, loudly.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">It feels similar to the way siblings don’t mind pushing each others buttons to see how far they can go before a big reaction.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">I also see it sort of like someone who likes to play with cats and kisses them and plays a little rough but doesn’t understand when they fold back their ears and swish their tails and are about to strike. Then the person is offended and doesn’t know how it escalated from kissing the cat to a scratch.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">She seems to bring on the animosity then not understand why he leaves and won&#39;t speak to her for a while. I don&#39;t think an explanation of my personal theory to her will help. The idea of coaching her the way I coach my children in similar situations (watch how that cat’s tail is swishing) feels odd because she is an adult. I have avoided that. But I know a little time and an older child will help.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">It&#39;s like she thinks he is too sensitive. He should be able to handle the scrutiny maybe. When he walks away that&#39;s when she seems sad and embarrassed. But that&#39;s not her words they are my thoughts about what happened. She might be feeling something else entirely. She does seem like she wants to make it better when he walks away. That&#39;s also the murky part for me, that she looks to me to make it better; I say it just takes time, we can&#39;t make it better right this minute.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-741924937\">I also don’t want her to sound like a villain who goes around being mean to young children. She is wonderful and much more skilled with older children. She is adventurous and physically fit in a way many grandparents are not, we hike together and garden together, our dogs are best friends, she shares her art studio with my boys and she is a wonderful advocate for our children generally. She just doesn’t have the skills to connect with younger children.

It’s a sort of testing ground of how will it all go and a revisiting of old issues like how will my parents react to my kids behaving in a way that I would have gotten punished for as a child? I have to say it is pretty subtle, but it’s worth asking whether this may be the case. Could you somehow want your mother and your child to have a conflict and work it out to avoid working out some issue you may have with your mother? If so then perhaps it is worth intervening and being more direct with your mother and being more protective of your child. If that’s not it at all and you feel confident in their joyful relationship and that there is more loving fun between them than struggle, maybe it’s okay to let them work it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am saying is that it is worth wondering about why you would let them sort it out on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he was going to “Get Air” (trampoline place) and they asked him to dunk his feet before he went jumping around, but you knew already he doesn’t like dunking his feet, would you drop him there to sort it out? Or would it just not be worth the drive because you already know that dunking his feet is too much right now and not worth the jumping? Or would you go in with him and help him figure a way to comply? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don’t think asking our parents who did not come to unschooling of their own accord to take on these principles while being childcare providers is practical. It’s like going to “Get Air” and asking if you could not wear socks and eat on the trampolines and also could they have a bouncy house instead of trampolines. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you needed the childcare and didn’t have other options at one time doesn’t mean that is the case today. <br/>\nIt makes sense that your 6 year old would still have some residual unpleasant feelings about that time having to be in their care because you were ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it’s okay if your mom is hurt because he doesn’t want to come because she insists on bathing. It gives also gives her an opportunity to decide if it is worth the visit to relax the have-to-bathe rule, while it gives your son a chance to decide if it’s worth the bath for the visit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be sad for everyone if the choice is not to visit. It might just be this one time. It might bring up issues of whether or not you want to spend that much time with your parents, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old is having conflicts with our 75 year old neighbor. They love each other, but he is reactive in a way that pushes her buttons. He sometimes wants to hit her when she jokes too hard with him. Then she says loudly “No Hitting!!”, he gets sad and embarrassed and doesn’t want to see her for a while. She gets sad and embarrassed and wants to figure out a way to work it out. I tell her that it will change as he gets older and they will find their way through this murky area. I don’t leave him in her care right now even though his older brothers negotiate with her just fine on their own and spend time with her without me. They just don’t know how to meet each other at this particular time. I do feel very confident that they will find their way through this and the friendship is worth this time and effort to negotiate the best for both of them right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Grandma&#39;s house","postDate":"1464131848","msgId":77102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l4PVc1eFdDY3YxOUxiNncrY01zcXVuN0NYZ2lLNVlyTVNZanM1Y3lPc1lod0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk3QUZGQzdFLTgzOEYtNDY4RS05NzMyLTM0MDQxRjBFOEUxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6UFFRUTJVdGhLK3NILU9VLXA9SlZuY0tvNysrT0x4eXBEUDI3OXBDcDY3QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDI5NzU2OUZELTgxMzktNDk5Ri1BMzE1LURBRERCMkMzRkQ0NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBUHYrY1l5d3Roc3YwdHFqY1M9QTJldHFzNzQrYzJBcz1CK196dlNMZVNRLTZicGZRUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDk3QUZGQzdFLTgzOEYtNDY4RS05NzMyLTM0MDQxRjBFOEUxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77101,"nextInTopic":77108,"prevInTime":77101,"nextInTime":77103,"topicId":77092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is when he is with her without me.
