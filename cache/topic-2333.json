If he wasn&#39;t involved when they were<br/>\nmarried, maybe he doesn&#39;t know what to do.  Are they unschoolers or<br/>\nhomeschoolers?   Is he thinking he&#39;ll have to miss work when the kids are<br/>\nwith him in order to homeschool?  Is he thinking about how badly he did<br/>\nin math?  She might address that.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, she might appeal to his protective nature.  The upheaval of divorce<br/>\nwill be difficult for their children, shouldn&#39;t they try to keep the rest<br/>\nof their lives as normal as possible.  The changes of divorce are bad<br/>\nenough,  the change of schooling might be overwhelming.   Maybe a  &quot;now<br/>\nisn&#39;t the right time&quot;  approach is better than an &quot;over my dead body&quot;<br/>\napproach.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of single, working, homeschooling moms.  It&#39;s probably<br/>\nvery hard, but it&#39;s not impossible.  She shouldn&#39;t feel like she&#39;s at his<br/>\nmercy.   Maybe hearing from some of those working moms would help.   <br/>\nWhen this happened to a friend of mine she found other homeschoolers,<br/>\nworking and not, willing to co-op child care. <br/>\n <br/>\nHow sad if it really is about the money.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb L.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Ex-Husbands Who Used to Support Homeschooling","postDate":"1010551208","msgId":2333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDEwODIwMzg0Ny4wMjNiM2VjMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2348,"prevInTime":2332,"nextInTime":2334,"topicId":2333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A friend whose husband left her recently phoned me asking for help continuing to homeschool her sons.
