I try to not insist on only one activity out at a time, because my<br/>\nkids might be combining stuff: the timer from one game, the cards from<br/>\nanother, drawing materials for creating a whole new game; to me, it might<br/>\njust look like a giganitic mess, but it&#39;s not to them.  My kids are older<br/>\nnow (12 and 14) and their stuff is more compact (how much room do 20 game<br/>\ncartridges take, after all?); our clean-up is usually before dad gets home,<br/>\nand before bed.

Little by little dd is<br/>\ngetting courageous and expressing her education choice.  Little<br/>\nby little the children in our neiborhood are learning to respect<br/>\nour choice.
