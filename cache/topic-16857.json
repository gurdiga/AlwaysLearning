I have<br/>\nNO CLUE... <br/>\n<br/>\nI was telling my brother about it this weekend by phone, and<br/>\ninterestingly, his wife had done the same thing with his ASE exam (auto<br/>\nmechanic).  She aced the test, but wouldn&#39;t be able to do any of the<br/>\nactual work if it came up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, when I worked as a web developer (for which I never went to<br/>\nschool, I was self taught) we hired a guy who had gone through one of<br/>\nthose 18 month certificate programs... Nice guy... But I had to teach<br/>\nhim from scratch... The very basics.  He learned, but had to admit, all<br/>\nhe knew after coming out of that program was how pass the tests to get<br/>\nthe certificate.  A year and a half of his life!  SO...
