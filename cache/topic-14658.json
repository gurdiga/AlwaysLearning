Stuff like.... how is Andy doing in his lessons?  What does he read? Does he do Math? Does he have friends?  What are his regular chores at your house, and what chores would he like here?  Wouldn&#39;t you like for Daniel to sleep somewhere other than your bed? Doesn&#39;t Dan bite when he nurses?  Doesn&#39;t Andy ever eat vegies or meat?   Daniel doesn&#39;t drink regular milk?

I bumped Andy in the mouth, making his very loose tooth bleed, but NOT fall out.... the dog got trapped in what we thought was an inaccessible spot, and woke us up to free her -- at 4AM -- as dh was heading for the shower to leave for work..... the boys (and I) never went back to bed, and now I have to go out to the store for Jello, because Andy can&#39;t eat and refuses to pull that darned tooth, and given my mood, I think I&#39;m PMS&#39;ing (never know when to expect that anymore)........
