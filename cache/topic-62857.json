So, I have chosen to stay with who has the most experience in unschooling and the grown children of that experience to boot. Sandra&#39;s various sources of information all feel right for me and my family. I never feel it necessary to veer off the path that her wisdom and years of experience bring to me. I am familiar with Dayna and her young children, but the same feeling about the information and insight as I have with Sandra, is not there for me with Dayna. Maybe another 10 or so years of experience and consistency will make Dayna&#39;s insight have more value for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSparkling over here,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sandra dodd and sparklingmartins?","postDate":"1315668917","msgId":62860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2MUIzNzhBLTI0MEMtNEE3OS1BMjEwLTEzQTZBQ0VGNzZCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEVBMTMzRjEzLTBEMDEtNDk1NC1BQ0MwLTlDNTIwMEI2QjYyMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGo0ZWpqYyt2MHZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUExMzNGMTMtMEQwMS00OTU0LUFDQzAtOUM1MjAwQjZCNjIxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":62858,"nextInTopic":62862,"prevInTime":62859,"nextInTime":62861,"topicId":62857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Do I stick to the assimilate all philosophy...-=- I ve never heard of an assimilate all philosophy.

The tool box and its arrangement are more art than practicality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a display at the San Diego airport, of clocks, or clock-like art, at least.

It&#39;s about learning, and leaaning is gradually, because it builds on what one already knows.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what one reads, all you can do is read a little and try it out and see if you can get it to work for you within your family.  And that doesn&#39;t happen in one second or one day.  It takes a while for you to even see how or whether it&#39;s working, and whether you can understand it and remember to apply it so that you can start to see differences.  That&#39;s what the wait a while and watch advice is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been saying people should live a sparkly life  for most of the past twenty years.
