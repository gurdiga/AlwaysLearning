Perhaps some of everyone else&#39;s <br/>\ncynacism has seeped into me over the years, I&#39;m not sure - I <br/>\ncertainly hope not. And I certainly hope that I don&#39;t have problems <br/>\nhere - this is the first busy board on this subject that I have <br/>\nfound and I am so interested in learning more about it! Although, <br/>\nsometimes you probably will find that I will play &quot;devil&#39;s <br/>\nadvocate&quot;  because I like to hear what people think about all side <br/>\nof the situation, please just me know if my horns are showing too <br/>\nmuch! <br/>\n    I&#39;ll try to make a list of the books I have read about <br/>\nunschooling so I can reference them better. I&#39;ll start with having <br/>\nread several by Holt(How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Learning <br/>\nAll the Time), Neill&#39;s Summerhill, Several about Sudbury Schools, <br/>\nAlbany Free school, Unschooling our children (deschooling <br/>\nourselves), the Happy Child, No Homework and Recess all Day, any <br/>\nmany more.<br/>\n   Actually it is rare that we have disagreements with ds, but <br/>\nunfortunately it is rare also that we have a long conversation <br/>\neither, which is something I would like to encourage but am unsure <br/>\nwhere to start other than just &quot;being there&quot; for him if he needs me, <br/>\nI am apparently going to have to rethink the &quot;natural consequences&quot; <br/>\nway of childrearing which is what we prettymuch what we used instead <br/>\nof kinds of punishements our parents and community use, please <br/>\nexcuse me that I don&#39;t understand all of this yet as I am still <br/>\nlearning!

It&#39;s just that of the children <br/>\nI know (I should know better than compare children) that they almost <br/>\nalways seem to be able to pick up after themselves starting at about <br/>\n3 years of age - NO KIDDING! But you also need to understand that I <br/>\nam considered pretty much a &quot;Revolutionist&quot; in my neighborhood that <br/>\nI don&#39;t spank my child! Very sad but true!!! I am trying so hard to <br/>\novercome the social roadblocks for freedom for my family. <br/>\n     Also when I said my ds hit me when I ask for a turn at the <br/>\nputer - I was asking for a turn, not saying &quot;give me a turn right <br/>\nnow!&quot; we are getting a 3rd computer for a 3 person household so at <br/>\nleast soon we wont have that argument! Can someone point me to some <br/>\ngood beginner books on game programming? I was thinking about <br/>\ngetting a clue about some of the basics and I think ds would enjoy <br/>\nsome as well (if not then that is fine also.) We do have family <br/>\nmeetings here and the reason it was brought up at the meeting was <br/>\nbecause it had happened several times before and that was what we <br/>\nhad agreed to do so we could wait until dad got home to talk more <br/>\nabout it, It&#39;s suppossed to be democratic and is highly suggested in <br/>\na lot of the books I&#39;ve read about unschooling.

Many of these<br/>\npoints have been made, but I decided to send it again for more feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have made it a point to have<br/>\n&gt;several tables of different heights in the family room to encourage<br/>\n&gt;him to keep things off of the floor<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have large baskets (sometimes just grocery bags) that I use to quickly<br/>\npick up things on the floor when either I can&#39;t stand it anymore or someone<br/>\nis coming over and we need the room.  When I have a little more time I can<br/>\nthen go through the baskets and put things away.  Some things now belong in<br/>\ntheir own baskets, so we can easily just scoop the stuff into it&#39;s storage<br/>\nplace quickly when we need to.  This makes it really easy to allow the<br/>\nplace to be a mess, but also have it get picked up quickly when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now as far as &quot;offering of consequences&quot; let me ask you what you do<br/>\n&gt;as this is an example of what we do in a family meeting.

That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat we do in our family (of 3 - dh, dd, and I.)  Sometimes if dd (who is<br/>\n5) has a problem with her Dad she will tell me and I will help facilitate,<br/>\nand visa-versa.  But, we do it at the time it comes up.  Sometimes if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t handle it well because of whatever reason, I will bring it up again<br/>\nafterward to say that I&#39;m sorry and to try to come to a mutual resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;then we ask DS why it&#39;s not okey to hit<br/>\n&gt;and he says because it hurts and isn&#39;t nice, then we ask if he could<br/>\n&gt;find a better way to express himself next time?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you asking him these questions because you want to test him to make<br/>\nsure he knows the right answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when my dd is having a problem getting along with one of her<br/>\nfriends she will discuss it with me.  I usually ask her if she needs some<br/>\nideas for new ways of resolving it, and if she says yes then we will<br/>\nbrainstorm together.  I will suggest something, she might not like it, but<br/>\nthen she will come up with and idea, then I might expand on it, etc...<br/>\nSometimes she just wants to dump her feelings with me and not try to fix<br/>\nthe problem.  That&#39;s OK too, because I often feel that way as well.

You could, in<br/>\nthe moment, say calmly &quot;please use words instead of hitting.&quot;  Try to see<br/>\nthat something deeper is going on within himself that he is struggling with<br/>\nand can not articulate, and maybe you could say &quot;I can see that you&#39;re<br/>\nstruggling to find the right words, perhaps it&#39;s not a good time for you to<br/>\nstop what you are doing.

As far<br/>\nas the hitting...I would handle it when it happens and not look for a<br/>\npunishment (even if he comes up with it). I have noticed that Jason hits<br/>\nme (not as often lately though) if he gets totally overwhelmed and does<br/>\nnot feel that I am listening to him. I rarely interrupt him when he is<br/>\non the computer, most of the time checking my email can wait until he is<br/>\ndone. He does wait for me to check my email in the morning, we have<br/>\ntalked about it and pretty much agreed that it is ok for me to check in<br/>\nthe morning then I won&#39;t have to bug him about it later and he can<br/>\nactually play longer. Sometimes he will come up to me while I am on the<br/>\ncomputer and want to use it...in this case I ask him to wait until I am<br/>\ndone reading the email or checking the website that I am on. When he has<br/>\ngotten impatient, I usually remind him that I do wait for him to get to<br/>\na good stopping point on his games and that helps. I also try not to<br/>\ntake too long getting off...realizing that he has less patience then I<br/>\ndo, I can check my email later, and that I want to positively reinforce<br/>\nhim asking nicely and waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found lately that Jason responds very well to logical<br/>\nexplanations. If he is hitting his brother (or me), I do stop it<br/>\nimmediately. We have been having conversations lately about whether<br/>\nhitting is effective at getting what he wants...if he wants something<br/>\nfrom Kyle, it definitely isn&#39;t...Kyle only holds on tighter. So I will<br/>\nhelp him ask Kyle for things or find an alternative. Often he will hit<br/>\nKyle when he is frustrated at his video game...in talking about this, I<br/>\nfound out that he does not like it when Kyle is watching if he is trying<br/>\nto solve a new part of the game...he likes to be alone so if he makes<br/>\nmistakes there is no one around. I have made more of a point to keep<br/>\nKyle (who is 4) occupied during these times and to keep an ear out for<br/>\nsigns that Jason might be getting frustrated so I can lure Kyle away (or<br/>\njust go sit with them which helps protect Kyle and helps calm Jason).<br/>\nThe point is to look at what is causing the hitting and realizing that<br/>\nthere are different solutions to the different reasons. Yes, hitting is<br/>\nunacceptable, but my focus has been on identifying why he hits and<br/>\nhelping him come up with better ways to handle those situations (more<br/>\nthen just &quot;use your words&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the toys...I honestly think that there is a &quot;clean gene&quot;. My<br/>\ndh and youngest have it, my oldest and I do not LOL! Honestly...dh can<br/>\nclean the kitchen or make a few piles in the living room and the room<br/>\n*looks* clean. I can spend half an hour and just manage to move things<br/>\naround a bit. My youngest always helps me clean up without asking (he<br/>\nactually got really mad when he was 2 and I wouldn&#39;t let him help me<br/>\nclean up the cat throw up!) My oldest does not really do much. Basically<br/>\nI have lots of baskets in the family room and it really does not take<br/>\nmuch to get the toys off the ground. The boys chip in and help if they<br/>\nwant to. Often I will suggest a quick clean up (less then 5 mins) before<br/>\nwe play a board game or build legos (usually because we need the room to<br/>\nplay!) In these instances, Jason is very willing to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Question....","postDate":"1076091911","msgId":18714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDEwMWMzZWNkZSQ4ZWI1NTg1MCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDkwLjQyMTIyNzIyLjJkNTUxMjk4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18713,"nextInTopic":18715,"prevInTime":18713,"nextInTime":18715,"topicId":17535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One <br/>\nline is &quot;Georgie&#39;s mother came to him with a bucket on her arm; saying, &#39;my <br/>\ndarling son, be careful how you run&#39;...&quot;  but I thought people nowadays won&#39;t <br/>\nknow what that bucket was.  It was a lunch-bucket.  Maybe a lard can with a bale. <br/>\n Maybe a manufactured lunch-box.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been thinking about mothers delivering lunches already today &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-DS is <br/>\n<br/>\nbrought up for hitting mom because she asked for a turn at the <br/>\n<br/>\ncomputer to check her email for a few minutes then he could return <br/>\n<br/>\nto his game, DS did you hit mom?

He says &quot;Say I&#39;m Sorry&quot;. . .-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you should stop having family meetings and start living in the moment.<br/>\nMaybe if you ask if you could check your mail when he gets to a good stopping <br/>\nplace, to please call you when it&#39;s your turn, he won&#39;t feel like hitting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Okey, <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat do you think should happen if you hit mom again? DS says that <br/>\n<br/>\nhe should have to have a time out (which we used to use for <br/>\n<br/>\ndiscipline but haven&#39;t for more than a year but he still refers to <br/>\n<br/>\nit) or perhaps he could not play any computer time for an hour. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds so contrived to me, and so too late.

So in my opinion &quot;going for an hour without computer&quot; is a <br/>\n<br/>\nconsequence that he offered and which we will use if it happens <br/>\n<br/>\nagain. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that it doesn&#39;t take a meeting to remind someone that using words is <br/>\nbetter than hitting, but maybe there should be a meeting for parents to <br/>\ndiscuss that if a child wants to hit the parents might need to change their <br/>\napproach.  Is he going to lose an hour of computer time because parents would rather <br/>\nblame a child than change their own awareness and respect-leve for him?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not likely that the mother&#39;s e-mail can&#39;t wait.  If she&#39;s expecting a <br/>\nnote about something that&#39;s happening in the next half hour, that&#39;s a good thing <br/>\nto push, but if waiting for the child&#39;s good pausing place is a possibility, <br/>\nthen the respect shown to that child will be returned up the line.

It&#39;s a rather repetitive/non-strategy game compared <br/>\nto the video games Duncan plays, and I can do it almost mindlessly. I *see* <br/>\nplays while doing something else. I&#39;m engaged, but not &quot;all there&quot;. Hard to <br/>\nexplain. Anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to just try to win. By the rules. You can&#39;t really cheat with computer <br/>\nsolitaitre because you can&#39;t steal cards from underneath or &quot;mis-shuffle,&quot; <br/>\nbut you can back up a bit and &quot;re-do&quot; a play or two.  I&#39;m pretty good. I have an <br/>\n82% win rate. I *used* to have a 94% win rate! But that was before I started <br/>\nto &quot;mess&quot; with the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow sometimes I&#39;ll deal three rows at first or deal two rows at a time after <br/>\nthe first move. I&#39;ll try to leave more cards on the board so I can make fewer <br/>\nmoves. By changing *my* rules, it makes the play harder, so I lose more. But <br/>\nthat&#39;s OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I found Spider Solitaire, I played regular old computer solitaire. My <br/>\ngoal was SPEEEED! I wanted to finish a game in less and less time.

These kids on the video/computer <br/>\ngames will start changing strategies----maybe they&#39;ll purposefully try to be <br/>\nkilled in a lower level so that they can see *exactly* how far they can go before <br/>\nlosing a life. Or how far can I take this guy *really* before he becomes so <br/>\nweak as to be ineffective----what&#39;s the DEPTH of the game, *really*? They&#39;ll <br/>\nstart pushing themselves further and further and dying sooner and sooner so that <br/>\nthey can see the LEAST amount they can do to win. When they can do *THAT*, <br/>\nthey&#39;ve &quot;mastered&quot; it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a neat plan. And it&#39;s an awesome progression. I LOVE watching *that* <br/>\nhappen , in particular. The &quot;regular, normal&quot; games rules aren&#39;t interesting to <br/>\nme anymore, but I LOVE to watch Duncan when he&#39;s moving on to the next phase <br/>\nand can show me how much further he can take the character (or how *little* he <br/>\ncan do with him).

We clean up messes so there<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is room for more mess!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Now I think of cleaning up after my kids as replacing a canvas. I do it with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the thought that by giving them room again and a bare floor and organized<br/>\n&gt;&gt; toys to pick from I&#39;m handing them the tools to write another mess onto our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; house. It&#39;s meant that at the end of a day, or sometimes a few days in a row,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I just let the mess stay, because really, it&#39;s a work of art or a story.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it isn&#39;t finished. Maybe it&#39;s too interesting to be gotten rid of so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; soon. It also clears up my feelings of resentment about doing the bulk of it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I like being the one to reset the house so that we all can live another,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; different mess the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; At the store the other day he saw a box on the<br/>\n&gt; floor and immediately picked it up and put it perfectly in it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; proper spot. ??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because that&#39;s where they belong in the store :-) Organizing and cleaning<br/>\ncan be very satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at home toys weren&#39;t bought to be stored neatly on the shelves. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat nick nacks are for ;-) Their purpose is to be out being played with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the family room he has lots of toys in there all<br/>\n&gt; the time, but I just don&#39;t like having them on the floor all the<br/>\n&gt; time because it&#39;s hard for people to walk over them<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have two people with wants that conflict. So the way you&#39;re modeling<br/>\nthat conflicting needs are to be resolved is that the person who is bigger<br/>\nand stronger gets to make the little person do what the bigger person wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he has lots many toys to the dog and I&#39;m not sure if he<br/>\n&gt; understands?? He is almost 6 btw.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe. But perhaps between cleaning up and losing toys, losing toys is the<br/>\nlesser evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until my daughter was 11/12 cleaning up even a little mess was<br/>\noverwhelming to her. It would look like she&#39;d be cleaning forever. She<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know where to start. She didn&#39;t know where to put things, even the<br/>\nobvious things. She didn&#39;t want me to keep telling her what to do next and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to decide on her own what to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can fight with him for the next 6 years (or 12 years if he&#39;s a late<br/>\nbloomer ;-). Or you can cheerfully accept that you&#39;ll have to be the one<br/>\ncleaning -- as you accept that you&#39;re the one who needs to take<br/>\nresponsibility for meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk for his help. And be very appreciative that he&#39;s interrupted something<br/>\nthat to him is a lot more important to do something for you. Even and<br/>\nespecially if you feel he&#39;s doing something trivial or he could have helped<br/>\na lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho would you rather help: someone who hovered over you, nagging you for not<br/>\ndoing the job the way they thought it should be done, or someone who asked<br/>\nyou to help and thanked you for what you could do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have made it a point to have<br/>\n&gt; several tables of different heights in the family room to encourage<br/>\n&gt; him to keep things off of the floor, I don&#39;t leave my things on the<br/>\n&gt; floor, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people eat at the kitchen table. Some people eat in front of the TV.<br/>\nIt&#39;s personal preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can model what works for us. But modeling isn&#39;t a sneaky way of making<br/>\nsomeone do something your way. It&#39;s an idea that they can check out to see<br/>\nif it might work for them. They can take it or leave it if something else<br/>\nwould work better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most of my daughter&#39;s life she has drawn and eaten sprawled out on the<br/>\nfloor. She even ate lunch sprawled on the kitchen table a few times. I<br/>\nalways used the couch drawing, reading and watching TV and sat &quot;properly&quot; in<br/>\na chair to eat. She&#39;s now more likely to sit on the couch for drawing and<br/>\nsits in a chair for eating. Not because she&#39;s finally picked up on my model<br/>\nand is doing it right, but because her body needs different things than it<br/>\ndid before and that&#39;s what works better for her now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157270430,"authorName":"Barbara Chase","from":"Barbara Chase &lt;barb@...&gt;","profile":"bc_avn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Re: Question....","postDate":"1076056217","msgId":18707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNjAxMDIwYmJjNDkwMTE0Y2RmM0BbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+"},"prevInTopic":18706,"nextInTopic":18709,"prevInTime":18706,"nextInTime":18708,"topicId":17535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That was what I thought <br/>\nabout the puter & TV but after a solid week of Rescue Heroes & Tonka <br/>\nI felt a bit weak, as far as a kid who about this time last year I <br/>\nhad someone tell me he was ADD he is doing what he usualy does - <br/>\nplaying the puter games until he can complete every last detail, <br/>\nalong the way memorizing every last line of each character is <br/>\nsaying, he will play until he absolutely has to go to the bathroom <br/>\nor hunger overtakes him (okey sometimes I sneak him a sandwich at <br/>\nthe desk which I do get a big thanks mom for). I think it is just me <br/>\nbecoming irritated at listening to the same things over and over <br/>\nagain, I need to move on and let him move on when he&#39;s ready. <br/>\nSince I wrote the post I also started my period so I thankfully can <br/>\nalso blame my PMS for some of my feelings and know I think that I <br/>\ncan deal with things again...<br/>\nAs for me walking around the room cheerfully picking up things, I&#39;ll <br/>\ntry, perhaps that is the reason he doesn&#39;t like to pick things up - <br/>\nI don&#39;t either, LOL! At the store the other day he saw a box on the <br/>\nfloor and immediately picked it up and put it perfectly in it&#39;s <br/>\nproper spot. ?? In the family room he has lots of toys in there all <br/>\nthe time, but I just don&#39;t like having them on the floor all the <br/>\ntime because it&#39;s hard for people to walk over them, or hurt or <br/>\nbreak when people walk on them or the dog could chew on them also, <br/>\nhe has lots many toys to the dog and I&#39;m not sure if he <br/>\nunderstands?? He is almost 6 btw. I have made it a point to have <br/>\nseveral tables of different heights in the family room to encourage <br/>\nhim to keep things off of the floor, I don&#39;t leave my things on the <br/>\nfloor, etc. But I will try your suggestion for the next few weeks <br/>\nand cheerfully pick up what is left on the floor - should I make it <br/>\na point to do this in front of him? Should I say anything or just <br/>\nlet the actions speak for themselves? <br/>\nNow as far as &quot;offering of consequences&quot; let me ask you what you do <br/>\nas this is an example of what we do in a family meeting. DS is <br/>\nbrought up for hitting mom because she asked for a turn at the <br/>\ncomputer to check her email for a few minutes then he could return <br/>\nto his game, DS did you hit mom? DS says yes, so we ask him what he <br/>\nthinks he should do? He says &quot;Say I&#39;m Sorry&quot;, okey does Mom accept <br/>\nthe appology? Mom say&#39;s Yes, then we ask DS why it&#39;s not okey to hit <br/>\nand he says because it hurts and isn&#39;t nice, then we ask if he could <br/>\nfind a better way to express himself next time? He says yes he could <br/>\ntell Mom she could have a turn after he finishes this level. Okey, <br/>\nwhat do you think should happen if you hit mom again? DS says that <br/>\nhe should have to have a time out (which we used to use for <br/>\ndiscipline but haven&#39;t for more than a year but he still refers to <br/>\nit) or perhaps he could not play any computer time for an hour. So <br/>\nwe agree that hitting hurt and it&#39;s better to use words than hitting <br/>\nand if it happens again then ds will have to go for an hour without <br/>\ncomputer. So in my opinion &quot;going for an hour without computer&quot; is a <br/>\nconsequence that he offered and which we will use if it happens <br/>\nagain. But sometimes he gets somewhere he says he doesn&#39;t know what <br/>\nshould happen, like if he leaves his toys on the floor in the living <br/>\nroom, I bring up that the dog might chew on them, but he still <br/>\nleaves them there, what am I missing???   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/5/04 7:02:18 PM, mozafamily@y... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I just really hate to sound &quot;out of sync&quot; but could someone <br/>\nplease <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; explain the rational behind allowing all the computer and TV time <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that the kid wants?

I&#39;ve just noticed that she keeps harping Janene on &quot;what she <br/>\nlearned this last month&quot; or pointing out when Janene has done something <br/>\nlike add, or read a double digit number or whatever.  I don&#39;t want her <br/>\nto do that anymore.  Starlene, our old EA, didn&#39;t ask questions like <br/>\nthat.  She basically just asked Lexie (at this age) what Lexie had been <br/>\ndoing, what she was reading, what projects she&#39;d done, what she was <br/>\ndoing in gymanstics or soccer or whatever.  But JoAnne, our new EA, is <br/>\nasking a lot about &quot;learning&quot; or pointing out that Janene is doing <br/>\n&quot;Adding&quot; or &quot;Math&quot;, etc.  Anyway, I need some help being more clear.... <br/>\ncan you help?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my rough draft....<br/>\n<br/>\nJoAnne, I was thinking today after you left that I think I&#39;d like for <br/>\nyou not to ask Janene about what she&#39;s learning.  Lexie is old enough <br/>\nand smart enough to understand why we are asking those questions, and <br/>\nshe&#39;s very involved in the idea of and immerced in the joy of <br/>\nunschooling.  She knows that we are just writing reports for the school <br/>\nand that it has nothing to do with what she needs to do as a life long <br/>\nlearned.  She probably understands better than I do that this is what we <br/>\ndo so gymnastics is paid. <br/>\n<br/>\n Janene is not at that point yet (and probably won&#39;t be for a few years) <br/>\nand I think the questions are interfering with the ideas of what I want <br/>\nJanene to embrace--that learning is something that happens all of the <br/>\ntime, just by living life.  I don&#39;t want her to start thinking &quot;what <br/>\nlearning did I do today?&quot; or &quot;am I learning something right now.&quot;  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot really explaining it correctly, or the way I want to explain it, <br/>\nI&#39;ll think more on it and see if I can say it better.  I guess that <br/>\nright now Janene is really wanting to learn to read and is wanting to do <br/>\n&quot;lessons&quot; to learn to read.  She has even said she wants to go to 1st <br/>\ngrade so she can learn to read and then homeschool after that.  This <br/>\ntells me that she has the idea that one can only learn to read if one is <br/>\nin school.  I think that to help her grasp that learning and life are <br/>\nnot seperate and that everything she does helps move her toward reading <br/>\nand that reading will come for her when it comes and that when that does <br/>\nthat will be the perfect time for her.  I just don&#39;t want to point out <br/>\n&quot;learning&quot; to her.  If we point out learning then it becomes seperate <br/>\nfrom daily life.  Let&#39;s see if I can explain it.  A few months ago <br/>\nJanene was counting kids in Lexie&#39;s line.  She said there wer 3 kid in <br/>\nfront of Lexie, and four behind.  You asked her how many in all and she <br/>\nsaid &quot;3 and 4 and 1 is 8.&quot;  You then asked if she knew she was adding.  <br/>\nShe said she didn&#39;t know what adding was, but you told her what she was <br/>\ndoing was learning to add.  There will be years enough for Janene to <br/>\nlearn that she was adding numbers.  She doesn&#39;t need to label that <br/>\n&quot;learning to add&quot; right now.  Right now she needs to enjoy that process.<br/>\n<br/>\nany ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18720,"nextTopicId":18768}}
