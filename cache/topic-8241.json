He wanted to read<br/>\nbecause others his age and younger could.  It made him feel stupid.  Some<br/>\nphonics programs created more problems than they solved and he just didn&#39;t<br/>\nget it.  Reading is still coming slowly - not a &quot;and then one day he took<br/>\noff and read the great novel&quot;.  He is nearly 12 and can read nearly any sign<br/>\nor label or short description, he can read comics, but a book is still a<br/>\nchallenge for him.  Once he makes a mistake it is hard for him to get back<br/>\ninto the rhythm somehow.  Other things come easily to him so it has been a<br/>\nbig surprise.  I don&#39;t understand so it is a struggle to help him and I have<br/>\nto leave it to him to tell me what he needs.  E-mailing and IM are helping<br/>\nwith spelling and that helps with reading so we move slowly forward.<br/>\nI agree with Deborah&#39;s label - When reading doesn&#39;t come easily.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a different story from those of kids who read later because they weren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested until later, for whom learning to read was fairly simple once<br/>\nthey<br/>\ndecided to do it.<br/>\nPerhaps this group are &quot;when reading comes later&quot;.  My younger son didn&#39;t<br/>\nread very early either but it never bothered him and it didn&#39;t frustrate<br/>\nhim.  He can always read what he has to read or wants to read but still<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t read that well - at least out loud.  However, he is reading Lord of<br/>\nthe Rings now so I guess he does well enough for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving patience to wait for my sons to figure out reading has been my most<br/>\ndifficult challenge as a homeschooler.  It is so visible to others that it<br/>\nbecomes a target to prove I am doing the wrong thing by my children.  It has<br/>\ntaken a leap of faith to trust that it will come.  I read everything I could<br/>\nget my hands on but none of the interventions made sense to me.  The &quot;most<br/>\nhighly recommended method of teaching dyslexics&quot; to read seemed so contrary<br/>\nto what my son would respond to that I couldn&#39;t make myself do it.  I<br/>\nsuspect the only intervention that would have helped would have been the one<br/>\nthat I did at the right time.  So, I have saved a lot of money, eaten quite<br/>\na bit of humble pie and I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I look<br/>\nforward to the day that I can confidently write an article about &quot;When<br/>\nreading doesn&#39;t come easily&quot; because my boys are reading any book that is<br/>\nout there.  But I am not there yet - not quite.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8229,"nextTopicId":8232}}
