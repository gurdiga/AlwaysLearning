This is how Amazon describes them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In his &quot;Educating Children at Home&quot; (2000), Alan Thomas found that many home educating families chose or gravitated towards an informal style of education, radically different from that found in schools. Such learning, also described as unschooling, natural or autonomous, takes place without most of the features considered essential for learning in school. At home there is no curriculum or sequential teaching, nor are there any lessons, textbooks, requirements for written work, practice exercises, marking or testing. But how can children who learn in this way actually achieve an education on a par with what schools offer? In this new research, Alan Thomas and Harriet Pattison seek to explain the efficacy of this alternative pedagogy through the experiences of families who have chosen to educate their children informally.Based on interviews and extended examples of learning at home the authors explore: the scope for informal learning within children&#39;s everyday lives; the informal acquisition of literacy and numeracy; the role of parents and others in informal learning; and, how children proactively develop their own learning agendas. Their investigation provides not only an insight into the powerful and effective nature of informal learning but also presents some fundamental challenges to many of the assumptions underpinning educational theory. This book will be of interest to education practitioners, researchers and all parents, whether their children are in or out of school, offering as it does fascinating insights into the nature of children&#39;s learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I want to make the distinction is because the newer one is much more him exploring how informal learning works as opposed to having just discovered that people do it. And it is a much more readable book rather than an academic tome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard Alan Thomas interviewed here in the UK and the interviewer was asking many of the usual questions, in a mildly aggressive &#39;yeah but&#39; tone of voice and Alan Thomas very sweetly continued to answer the questions and reiterate how amazing it all is and then blew me away when he said he wished he&#39;d known about it when his kids were young. Now that is what I like to hear on my radio.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;JoyErin&quot; &lt;joyerin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Catherine welcome!
