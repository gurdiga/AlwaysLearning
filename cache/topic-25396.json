I&#39;d just come home from a one-day conference -- probably <br/>\nthe first time I heard Sandra speak -- with an armload of interesting <br/>\ntoys and books and a head full of inspiration.  One of the books was <br/>\nabout finding Titanic, and included a paper model, which I decided <br/>\nMommy should put together (I really like that kind of thing :-)  I was <br/>\nworking on it after the kids had gone to bed, but then-7-y.o. Alex got <br/>\nup.  He looked at the book and we talked about it as I worked; we <br/>\ndiscovered what a fathom was, and that Titanic came to rest on the <br/>\ncontinental shelf, not the very bottom of the ocean, and I&#39;m sure some <br/>\nmore interesting things, but those stick in my mind.  About a half hour <br/>\nlater, Alex went back to bed and I kept gluing.  Dh came in and said, <br/>\n&quot;So that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  He&#39;d overheard the conversation.  I said, <br/>\n&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s unschooling.&quot;  Never had an argument after that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Jumping in with high school and middle school","postDate":"1145757435","msgId":25397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVCQkI1MzI4LTc4MDEtNDI0Ni04NzczLTBGNzU5RkY1RTcxREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUyZWgydStxNWw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUyZWgydStxNWw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25396,"nextInTopic":25398,"prevInTime":25396,"nextInTime":25398,"topicId":25396,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
