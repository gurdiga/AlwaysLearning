She s good and they were","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-737063620\">Last year we stopped at some little art gallery somewhere and my son<br/>\nfound paintings he really liked by a local Montana artist.   She&#39;s good<br/>\nand they were expensive, so we looked and looked and left without them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA little later we made our way into a gallery in our  town, the owner&#39;s<br/>\nalso an artist and very friendly fellow, and there were several paintings<br/>\nby this artist Dylan liked.   She&#39;s an acquaintance, it turns out of the<br/>\ngallery owner and he&#39;d arranged for her to be at a yearly artists<br/>\ngathering.  <br/>\nWe went.  <br/>\nWe wandered around and looked at paintings and talked to artists, all of<br/>\nwhom were very friendly and encouraging to Dylan.  We finally found where<br/>\nthis woman was painting and she had three or four projects she was<br/>\nworking on.  Dylan gushed.  He was so delighted to meet her and talk with<br/>\nher and tell her how wonderful she was.  She wasn&#39;t terribly friendly,<br/>\nmaybe she was hungry or something, but I wished it had been nicer for<br/>\nDylan, although he didn&#39;t seem to care that she wasn&#39;t as engaging as<br/>\nsome of the other artists we had talked to.  <br/>\nSo, yesterday we were in Butte, wandering around the galleries and Dylan<br/>\nstarted pointing out these works he liked.  The woman there asked what he<br/>\nwas doing and he told her he really liked these certain paintings, mostly<br/>\nwatercolors and he wondered who the artist was.  Well, she said, she was<br/>\nthe artist and they talked for about half an hour and she showed him a<br/>\nbook with pictures of all her work.   He told her he also liked this<br/>\nother artist and as it happens they knew each other.  <br/>\nShe said wouldn&#39;t it be nice to meet her at the next artist gathering and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t it be fun to get to talk to two of his favorite artist at the<br/>\nsame time.. she was very nice.<br/>\nThis morning the owner of the gallery here in town called me.  He lines<br/>\nup all the artists who will come to the annual artist gathering here and<br/>\nhe said he&#39;d been talking to his friend at the Butte gallery and would my<br/>\nson like to be one of the artists in attendance there this year.<br/>\nI was so excited.  When he woke up I told him and he said, that&#39;s nice,<br/>\nwhen will it be, ok then, I&#39;m usually not too busy in August.    Just<br/>\nlike that.  <br/>\nJust so matter of fact.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, who needs no coffee this morning.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6401,"nextTopicId":6426}}
