I decided <br/>\n&gt; to do a little first hand research of my own and<br/>\n&gt; find out what they <br/>\n&gt; were all about.  So I have been in touch with the<br/>\n&gt; Executive Director <br/>\n&gt; of our local Council, to get more information. In<br/>\n&gt; the course of our <br/>\n&gt; correspondence, he sent me some pages from the<br/>\n&gt; Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>\n&gt; it looked pretty good, but I was given pause by<br/>\n&gt; certain parts of it.  <br/>\n&gt; I thought I would share about my concerns here and<br/>\n&gt; get some feedback <br/>\n&gt; from all of you, and also ask for experiences of<br/>\n&gt; those who have been <br/>\n&gt; involved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with<br/>\n&gt; my Camp Fire <br/>\n&gt; contact.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire<br/>\n&gt; USA Builds <br/>\n&gt; Developmental Assets<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It begins by talking about the results and findings<br/>\n&gt; of a study done <br/>\n&gt; by the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which<br/>\n&gt; identified asset <br/>\n&gt; building as a focus for youth development instead of<br/>\n&gt; problem <br/>\n&gt; solving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see<br/>\n&gt; prevention as <br/>\n&gt; better than bandages in general.  They go on to say<br/>\n&gt; that they have <br/>\n&gt; identified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that<br/>\n&gt; they believe help <br/>\n&gt; youth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking<br/>\n&gt; positives in their <br/>\n&gt; program, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the next part starts to get creepy, and reads<br/>\n&gt; like a recipe for <br/>\n&gt; cooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool<br/>\n&gt; proof plan.  Here <br/>\n&gt; are the 14 assets:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and<br/>\n&gt; friendship  <br/>\n&gt; -Young person has knowledge of and comfort with<br/>\n&gt; people of different <br/>\n&gt; cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>\n&gt; (ok, so far so good)<br/>\n&gt; -Young person serves the community 1 or more hours<br/>\n&gt; per week<br/>\n&gt; (whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as<br/>\n&gt; community service?  Is <br/>\n&gt; the age of the child considered?  I think community<br/>\n&gt; service is a <br/>\n&gt; great thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; being involved in a <br/>\n&gt; program where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet<br/>\n&gt; some objective <br/>\n&gt; set by the group.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Young person receives support from 3 or more<br/>\n&gt; non-parent adults<br/>\n&gt; (ok, that sounds good)<br/>\n&gt; -Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in<br/>\n&gt; lessons or practice <br/>\n&gt; in music, theater or other arts<br/>\n&gt; (whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on<br/>\n&gt; arts?  What counts <br/>\n&gt; according to them?  What if my child is not<br/>\n&gt; classically artistic, or <br/>\n&gt; goes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in<br/>\n&gt; sports, clubs, and <br/>\n&gt; organizations at school or in the community<br/>\n&gt; (whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and<br/>\n&gt; recreational <br/>\n&gt; sports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to<br/>\n&gt; do this or that, <br/>\n&gt; ok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok. <br/>\n&gt; But just saying <br/>\n&gt; that they spend X amount of hours per week is so<br/>\n&gt; arbitrary and <br/>\n&gt; controlling to me.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing<br/>\n&gt; special to do&quot; two or <br/>\n&gt; fewer nights per week.<br/>\n&gt; (What??  Does that mean they think all their time<br/>\n&gt; should be planned <br/>\n&gt; and scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean<br/>\n&gt; we are not <br/>\n&gt; supposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in<br/>\n&gt; general about how they <br/>\n&gt; spend their time?)<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; The rest sounds good<br/>\n&gt; -Young person can resist negative peer pressure and<br/>\n&gt; dangerous <br/>\n&gt; situations<br/>\n&gt; -Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>\n&gt; -Young person knows how to plan ahead and make<br/>\n&gt; choices<br/>\n&gt; -Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over<br/>\n&gt; things that <br/>\n&gt; happen to me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>\n&gt; -Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -Young person is optimistic about his or her<br/>\n&gt; personal future<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula<br/>\n&gt; are outcome <br/>\n&gt; based.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to<br/>\n&gt; develop these <br/>\n&gt; assets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; recognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and<br/>\n&gt; referenced <br/>\n&gt; throughout the grade level program books.  This<br/>\n&gt; makes it easy to know <br/>\n&gt; if you are using the Camp Fire activities and<br/>\n&gt; projects as designed, <br/>\n&gt; the children will be experiencing the outcomes that<br/>\n&gt; will make them <br/>\n&gt; caring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many<br/>\n&gt; ways can I say <br/>\n&gt; ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I<br/>\n&gt; just looking at <br/>\n&gt; this the wrong way or not understanding what they<br/>\n&gt; are trying to say?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When<br/>\n&gt; children and youth <br/>\n&gt; join Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate<br/>\n&gt; to their grade.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Is this program totally geared toward the<br/>\n&gt; institutional schooling <br/>\n&gt; system, and would we be totally out of place?  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really want to <br/>\n&gt; separate my children out into narrow band age<br/>\n&gt; groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt; it is socially good for them.  I am one of those who<br/>\n&gt; is of the <br/>\n&gt; opinion that institutional schooling is<br/>\n&gt; intrinsically bad for the <br/>\n&gt; human mind and spirit, and that the institutional<br/>\n&gt; educational model <br/>\n&gt; can never be made healthy enough to be effective or<br/>\n&gt; positive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well<br/>\n&gt; I have heard <br/>\n&gt; enough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer<br/>\n&gt; to their <br/>\n&gt; experiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a<br/>\n&gt; shudder.  Perhaps <br/>\n&gt; that was just their local group or council, or is<br/>\n&gt; that indicative of <br/>\n&gt; the general atmosphere?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Dear Nanci,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that groups use a schoolish paradigm because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have anything else to refer to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has become so pervasive in our society.  You can&#39;t<br/>\ngo anywhere without being exposed to that &quot;kids are<br/>\ninferior and need to be controlled&quot; approach. Whip<br/>\nthem into shape. Etc....  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe brain washing most received in institutional<br/>\nschool was thorough and worked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to think that the rest of the community being<br/>\nexposed to UNschoolers is a breath of fresh air for<br/>\nthem and maybe, in some small way, we can open up<br/>\ntheir box just a crack and they&#39;ll get at least a<br/>\nglimmer of light that may make them want more. (Yes,<br/>\never the Optimist.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a conversation with a Campfire USA leader from<br/>\nTN,(I think), at the Live and Learn UNschooling<br/>\nconference in Columbia. <br/>\n<br/>\nI met so many people that I am having trouble<br/>\nremembering her name, but I will check the<br/>\nregistration list unless someone here maybe remembers<br/>\nand can supply it.  She has 3 sons and began as a<br/>\n&quot;backup&quot; leader in the first group in her state.  The<br/>\nother 2 leaders moved and now she is the leader.  (It<br/>\ndoes seem to work out that way ...   ;*)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she was telling me about the ways that it<br/>\ndiffers from Boy Scouts.  I mentioned that my sons had<br/>\na homeschool friend whose dad is an Eagle scout and is<br/>\na leader, but that I had talked it over with my sons<br/>\nand explained that this is a club that discriminates<br/>\nbased on sexual orientation,(i.e. NO [known] gays),<br/>\nand that I didn&#39;t feel good about supporting an<br/>\norganization that kicked out or kept out members based<br/>\non that criteria. My sons agreed that that was not<br/>\nacceptable. They were lukewarm on the idea of scouts<br/>\nto begin with so it was dropped without any<br/>\nunhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n(In discussing it with my friend, the leader&#39;s wife,<br/>\nshe assured me that ALL boys were welcomed in her<br/>\nhusband&#39;s group.  I expressed that I appreciated that<br/>\nhe was a good guy, but that his organization didn&#39;t<br/>\nback up his philosophy and that intolerance and<br/>\ndiscrimination are therefore implicit in their<br/>\noperation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Campfire USA leader indicated to me that there is<br/>\nnot the same type of pseudo-religious approach<br/>\ninvolved.  Also, the para-military procedures aren&#39;t<br/>\npresent.  When the children earn badges, they may<br/>\nplace them wherever they choose.  It is a much more<br/>\ninformal approach toward earning them as well.  She<br/>\nwas telling me that they often found that they had met<br/>\nthe criteria for a badge, would document it and<br/>\nreceive it.  As compared to the &quot;nothing in the past<br/>\ncounts&quot; approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll check with Kelly and see if I can find her name. <br/>\nHer group has done really well and she&#39;s not had a<br/>\nproblem reconciling it as an UNschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got all this info. from a brief conversation.  So,<br/>\nplease do verify and further research.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mom really enjoyed that it was a co-ed group that<br/>\ngave her sons the opportunity to participate in<br/>\nactivities with girls as their were no sisters in the<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only &quot;negative&quot; I got from our talk was that they<br/>\nhave to sell candy bars.  Personally, I HATE that kind<br/>\nof vendor fund raising.  I&#39;d much rather be told what<br/>\nthe $$$ bottom line and decide how to raise the money<br/>\nmyself.  Pushing sweets doesn&#39;t thrill me.  But, I<br/>\ntake it that is the standard in all these types of<br/>\ngroups.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone else doesn&#39;t post it, I&#39;ll look for her<br/>\ninfo. later today.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
