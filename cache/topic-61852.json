One is a quote from something Joyce Fetteroll wrote as a moderator in the context of another list. When I see great Joyce-logic in obscure places I want to bring it out and frame it.   So although it&#39;s not of or about this list, it totally applies:<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nThe responses list members provide are like detectives analyzing clues left behind. They reflect the patterns they observe in what they see, in the list&#39;s case, in someone&#39;s writing. They&#39;re saying &quot;Here&#39;s the patterns I see. Here&#39;s some common causes.&quot; Those patterns are real. Why those patterns showed up in the writing is up to the original poster to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responses that feel satisfying on the list are either silence (as someone thinks about the patterns objective strangers are seeing in their writing) or &quot;Oh, my goodness, I&#39;d never thought about it that way,&quot; perhaps followed with some further objective analysis of the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat doesn&#39;t feel satisfying is denying what was observed. Whether someone can see in their life what was observed by others in their writing or not doesn&#39;t remove it from the writing. Denying is like snatching the writing back and editing it to provide a &quot;better&quot; copy to analyze. That&#39;s called tampering with evidence ;-) We&#39;re not providing judgement of the person. We&#39;re providing analysis of the writing. The judgement is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a mother writes (and offers to speak to others) of children being &quot;Distractable, Impatient, Argumentative, Unenthusiastic, Non-book-loving, Inattentive, Poky, Vague,&quot; there&#39;s no taking that back.  She has had those thoughts about her own children, or other people&#39;s, or both.  She&#39;s not embarrassed to say so.  She thinks that&#39;s normal.  &quot;Real.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the other e-mail I&#39;m quoting now is from someone who just read The Big Book of Unschooling and wanted to share with me that it was encouraging, and wrote, &quot;I had a hard time narrowing down what in the book I liked the most . . .   But I think it would have to be this: &quot;If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life becomes easier.&quot; Of all the homeschooling, parenting and unschooling books I have read, that line has jumped out at me most of all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe gave a contrasting example:<br/>\n---------<br/>\nI recently read a blog of a woman . . . who wanted to encourage mothers to homeschool even though it would be painful, tearful, and very difficult at times.  I&#39;m not sure why everybody buys into this notion that being a parent has to involve tears, harsh discipline, and control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is I have no interest in having a home like that. <br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things unschooling can provide are the exceptions that prove the rule.  &quot;The exception proves the rule&quot; is an odd saying.

So we&#39;re going to consider a middle-of-the-night meal after they pick me up from the airport. Then Marty&#39;s girlfriend came in and asked about my 40th high school reunion.  She and Marty are going to go with me to my home town--not to the gatherings, probably, but we&#39;ll stay in a hotel together, because most of the relatives I used to stay with aren&#39;t there anymore (biologically or geographically).
