I used to feel like that too, although i didnt want to <br/>\noverprotect my kids. But i did find a great organisation, Woodcraft <br/>\nFolk, which is a co-operative organisation for girls and boys, and it <br/>\nis like cubs without the authoritarianism etc. They do loads of <br/>\nreally cool stuff depending where you live of course, and have camps <br/>\nwhich are for the whole family.Many of the people we met there were <br/>\nlike minded, there were a few unschooies and the kids were all really <br/>\ngreat, non-judgemental, not into being fashion vicitms etc!<br/>\nTo introduce myself, which i should have done first, I am single mum <br/>\nto 2 great unschooled autonomous boys, age 11 and 17. My eldest has <br/>\nan autistic spectrum &quot;disorder&quot; which was only a problem during the <br/>\nfew years he did attend school. By the time i was thinking about <br/>\nstuff like home-school conflict etc I had a 5 year old as well and i <br/>\ndecided to continue the free child stuff and not send him to school, <br/>\nand my eldest came out of school. His &quot;problems&quot; are only problems in <br/>\na false environment where kids are judged by their ability to fit in <br/>\nwith school. To cut a long story short, the youngest has never had <br/>\nany formal education, not been &quot;taught&quot; to read and write etc and is <br/>\na happy, confident and independent young kid, who knows how to talk <br/>\nto people and knows how to learn what he needs to. He is into <br/>\nbuilding websites, repairing and upgrading PCs, and a lot <br/>\nof &quot;outdoor&quot; stuff. He is very popular with his friends of all ages, <br/>\nincluding babies! The eldest works part time in a bakery in a <br/>\nsupermarket, he manages okay, and is happy which are the main <br/>\nconcerns with autistic kids as far as i feel, not whether or not they <br/>\ncan seem &quot;normal&quot;. Unschooling has worked for us,I know a lot of <br/>\npeople who don&#39;t trust their kids enough to let them be free, even <br/>\nthough they do comment on my kids and how &quot;well&quot; they do, <br/>\nparticularly the youngest. I also know people who cannot believe that <br/>\ntheir children would be able to educate themselves. I always say to <br/>\nthem, let them be for a few weeks and see just how much they do, even <br/>\nif it isn&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;. In fact we don&#39;t distinguish between <br/>\neducational and non-educational as all things are ducational to a <br/>\nchild.<br/>\nWe are also an attachmentparenting/continuum family and i feel that <br/>\nunschooling has followed on naturally from that, although i know some <br/>\npeople only &quot;do&quot; attachment parenting for the first few years and <br/>\neven then not all the time.<br/>\nI would like to recommend a book called Magical Child by Joseph <br/>\nChiltern Pearce, which explains in more detail how children do learn <br/>\nfrom their experiences and why it is so important that they should be <br/>\nable to explore their environment, by touch, taste, smell etc, <br/>\nwithout interference from well meaning adults, and why things like <br/>\nhaving their needs met on cue can affect the development of their <br/>\nminds. It also explains why teaching young chidren abstract concepts <br/>\nis so damaging. I havent seen this book in the UK as it is not in <br/>\nprint here, but i happen to sell it through my attachment parenting <br/>\nsmall business, along with all the John Holt books and other home <br/>\ned,unschooling and natural parenting books, plus baby slings and so <br/>\nforth. You can email me for a list or catalogue at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kinder-supplies@...\">kinder-supplies@...</a> . But this is not an advert, I&#39;m <br/>\nmerely trying to spread the word. I recommended that book long before <br/>\ni sold it. Another book i would recommend, although it is about a <br/>\nschool, is Summerhill, by ASNeill. I dont sell that one, it is widely <br/>\navailable and can be bought second hand as well.<br/>\nI would really love to hear from other parents of adolescents who <br/>\nhave been self directed/autonomous from birth and who have resisted <br/>\nthe urge to teach them, it would be very interesting to see if they <br/>\nare all as self sufficient!<br/>\nRegards to you all, and i do look forward to reading and posting on <br/>\nthe list!<br/>\nCal, Newcastle upon Tyne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5307326,"authorName":"GSmith8995@aol.com","from":"GSmith8995@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Feeling inferior and wrong","postDate":"1028820388","msgId":8368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOS4xNTg1NTg5Ni4yYTgzZTdhNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8377,"prevInTime":8367,"nextInTime":8369,"topicId":8368,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know how to capture stuff, but the comment about being made to feel inferior and wrong came up.
