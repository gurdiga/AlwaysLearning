When our kids are being less than perfect, we can feel<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing something wrong, that their behavior is a reflection on us and<br/>\nour skills as a parent. But negative phrases are a way of separating &quot;them&quot;<br/>\nfrom &quot;us&quot;. Kids become &quot;other&quot;, that is, other than us, other than (adult)<br/>\nhuman. So it becomes okay for &quot;them&quot; to act in bizarre ways and for us not<br/>\nto be able to do anything about it. And it&#39;s even better when we can get<br/>\nagreement from other parents that, yes, kids are &quot;other&quot;, they&#39;re almost<br/>\nalien creatures in their behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lists aren&#39;t about stuffing down guilt or about shrugging off guilt.<br/>\nThey&#39;re about getting to a better place: seeing kids as fellow humans. Kids<br/>\nmay react to situations in ways that would be bizarre reactions for adults<br/>\nbut the emotions behind the reactions are pure human emotions.
