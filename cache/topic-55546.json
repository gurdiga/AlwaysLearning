It&#39;s likely to happen. It&#39;s what usually happens. Then  <br/>\nthe owners, moderators and list members help people who want to  <br/>\nunschool to move in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just want to take without giving, then it&#39;s okay to read and  <br/>\nnot post. Plenty of people do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we should get back to discussing unschooling now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\nBegin forwarded message:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Claire Marketos&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claire@...\">claire@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: June 30, 2010 10:24:36 AM PDT<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robin.bentley@...\">robin.bentley@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Do you have research<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Robin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope this email I sent to the group explains why I�m here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hear that you are very angry Sandra that I choose to take an  <br/>\n&gt; independent stance on meeting my children�s needs and that you would  <br/>\n&gt; prefer it if I went away.
