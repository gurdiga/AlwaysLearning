I&#39;ve been thinking about leadership and how it relates to being an unschooling parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe background to this is that I naturally tend to state things in a very direct way. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Today we&#39;re going to the store and then the park.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Get your shoes on, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s do a little clean up and then we&#39;ll watch a movie or read some books and go to bed.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that is set in stone, it doesn&#39;t have to be that way, and I&#39;m fine with the kids having a different idea and then I try to work with it.  That&#39;s just the way I tend to say things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my oldest child, I&#39;ve had to learn how to phrase things in a less direct way, because she responds better.  If I say, &quot;We&#39;re doing X,&quot; she bristles, but if I say &quot;I think X would be a good idea,&quot; she doesn&#39;t.  It comes more naturally now than it used to, but it still requires me to think before I speak (a good thing, of course!) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo more like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I need to go to the store today, and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d like to go to the park.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my middle child, she just goes along with whatever most of the time no matter how I phrase it, and if she does want to do something else, she just states it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend recently said to me, &quot;I&#39;m surprised at how easily you say no.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to say yes often and a lot of the yes&#39;s are just built into our lifestyle.  But I guess I don&#39;t hem and haw and try to be saccharine sweet when I do say no.  If it&#39;s not a safety thing, I&#39;ll try to work with them to find a solution if they don&#39;t like the answer, but I&#39;m just confident when I say it and they often just accept it because I give a reason with it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does this have to do with leadership?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started thinking of all of this as leadership skills.  I don&#39;t mean leadership in the sense of management or institutional leadership.  I mean it in the sense of being the type of person people want to follow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m juxtaposing it to the type of parent who asks everything. &quot;Do you want to go to the park today?  Do you want to wear shoes?  Do you want to go to bed?  Is it ok if mommy takes a shower?  Can I make dinner now?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I do ask them questions as well, and I love their input, I just don&#39;t leave it to them to plan our days or make every decision.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m trying to work out how these thoughts about leadership relate to partnership and the fact that my kids won&#39;t (and don&#39;t now, but even more so as they get older) always want to follow me and that&#39;s a good thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily   <br/>\n<br/>\nEzabella 6<br/>\nLiliana 4<br/>\nZaria 1</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68367,"nextTopicId":68465}}
