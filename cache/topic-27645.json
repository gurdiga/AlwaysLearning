(Lots of volcanos in Dora, don&#39;t<br/>\nyou know?!?)<br/>\nThe link from the google page didn&#39;t have a good picture :( or a map,<br/>\nso I zipped over to the BBC site and found an article on it there. I<br/>\nreally love BBC news because they have a map for each article!<br/>\nSo then we could see where it was, and Fin grabbed her new mini-globe<br/>\n(from Discovery channel store, it also lights up!) and we found it on<br/>\nthere (well, the Caribbean area), and had a discussion about where we<br/>\nwere relative to it, would we be affected by the ash, did we know<br/>\nanyone near that area, what is ash and what does it do, what about the<br/>\npeople who live on the island, how the wind would blow it... led to<br/>\nweather maps... and then back to more pictures of the volcano, but<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t exciting enough, so we searched for other volcano<br/>\npictures, preferably with lots and lots of lava...
