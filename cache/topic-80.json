I have been overweight my whole life, and 100 lbs. over <br/>\nfor the last few years so I thought the pain was <br/>\nall just all my fault for being so fat. It got so strong, sharp, and <br/>\nweird the past week so I made an appt with a gyn to get checked out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the gyn lady doc today (she is such a neat person, very good <br/>\ndoc), and found through exam and ultrasound, a 16 mm reason for my <br/>\npain. For those of us like me who have no idea <br/>\nwhat 16 mm is, think about 6.3 inches, about the size of a cantaloupe. <br/>\nOuch! She said it was an ovarian cyst and has to come out. I do want it <br/>\nout, it really hurts. I have surgery scheduled for <br/>\nWed. 5 Dec. I had a c-sction almost 7 years ago so I have some idea <br/>\nwhat recovery will be like. Not looking forward to the hard part, but <br/>\nreally looking forward to feeling better when it&#39;s all <br/>\ndone and healed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny info or experience any of you might have on this topic would be <br/>\nreally appreciated. I know it&#39;s not really the topic of the list, so <br/>\nyou could send it to my email instead of the list if that&#39;s <br/>\nok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to search the net for info also. I&#39;ll be online till dec 5th <br/>\nsurgery. I don&#39;t know after the 5th when I will be back online but I&#39;ll <br/>\nget back on when I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go back and try to get more sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nMay love guide and protect you<br/>\nMakana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6,"nextTopicId":55}}
