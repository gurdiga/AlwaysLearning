This happened to me with school<br/>\nand later with work and I realize that I built up this idea in my head that I<br/>\nnever had enough time for me.  Enough time to do the things *I* wanted to do. <br/>\nSo I jealously guarded it and found what I did get never felt like enough.  I<br/>\nwould hoarde it.  And I think I went into parenthood with this idea too. <br/>\n <br/>\nBUT now I get it.  And it is really such a small shift I needed to make.

If I wanted to sew something (a medieval costume for a child, for instance), I would work on it when they were asleep and put my supplies away carefully).  Mostly, I didn&#39;t sew.  It was more important to be with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I switched out on doing things without kids for an hour or two, or a day or two.  A couple of times we both went somewhere (once we took Marty) and left the kids with an adult or family they really liked and trusted, some of the time at our house rather than elsewhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBalance is important here.  Sometimes a while away won&#39;t hurt.  Neither always nor never are the way to go.

My first thought was that I can think of two more reasons. 1) introverts who need &quot;me time&quot; to recharge and 2)in order to pursue a hobby<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Meredith that for the first I don&#39;t need big chunks of time. I also may not need it every day, so it isn&#39;t like I have to get away from the kids or put them to bed early so I can have that time, but I definitely benefit from some solitude (or near solitude like she said, I know that sometimes if I can spend a few moments knitting in the midst of everything else going on that is a little boost of inner solitude/meditation that helps recharge me). <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the second one I mentioned, this may not apply as much when kids are older or to every hobby, but both my husband and I have hobbies that are difficult to pursue with young kids around (ours are 5 and 2). We do involve our kids in our hobbies as much as possible (for him it is working on motorcyles, for me it is knitting and spinning), so we&#39;ve got even our youngest turning wrenches and experimenting with my spinning wheel. But at some point if we want to seriously pursue these hobbies then we definitely benefit from pursuing them alone at least some of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I get the feeling that it is seen as a negative thing if a parent enjoys or wants time away from their kids. We aren&#39;t dropping our kids off to go on vacation alone, or even to go out to dinner. But if my husband wants an afternoon alone in the garage to saw apart pieces of metal, or I want to take one Saturday a month to go to the local spinner&#39;s guild we try to make that happen for each other. Maybe this isn&#39;t the sort of thing people are talking about when they talk about &quot;me time&quot;? I do like having some time to myself on occasion, but I also flaked out of taking a weekend trip alone this fall because as the date has approached I decided I&#39;d rather have the kids and my husband come with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Annie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Me Time","postDate":"1313352840","msgId":62373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGoyOWFhOCtnM3MyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGoyNmdnMStxdXRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62372,"nextInTopic":62375,"prevInTime":62372,"nextInTime":62374,"topicId":62327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i have unschooled for 10 years and have had very little time away from my children.  but i am at the moment sat in my brothers home in vienna without my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1604784168\">i have unschooled for 10 years and have had very little time away from my children.  but i am at the moment sat in my brothers home in vienna without my children.  it was a huge decision to leave them with my husband to come here but my mum needed to see my brother and cannot fly alone.  it is me time to some extent and after 10 years it feels kind of nice in some ways to be here alone but i am missing them and thinking of them .  i go back on wednesday having been away 6 days and i know i will be VERY glad to see them (oh and my hubby)<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;LauraM&quot; &lt;la_tree@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo! for both of you and all the people who will benefit in your childs life when he further fully engages in social interactions where all find joy.

Instead, I flipped over and started cutting out stick figures.  After we were done Austin took the stick figures, asked if he could play in the bathroom (which is attached to the bedroom) and play.  I said sure.  He helped me clean up so I wouldn&#39;t trip over boxes or slip on paper in the middle of the night and then turned off the light for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This morning I woke up and in the bathroom were the stick figure guys hanging on a towel and action figures hanging off cabinet handles.

I don&#39;t know why, it&#39;s just how I&#39;ve felt since the minute my first was born. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot imagine how many times I&#39;ve been told by family and friends that I need &quot;me time&quot;.  But I don&#39;t!  My pleasure comes from going to new places with my family or just simply hanging out with my boys. I actually really enjoy their company!  They are smart and interesting and are always challenging things.  They know who they are and what they want and need and it&#39;s refreshing and energizing to be around people like that.  I do not know many adults that keep me as interested as my kids do ;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble is when everyone is insisting that I need &quot;me time&quot;, I start to question myself - maybe I really do need me time! What&#39;s wrong with me that I feel OK without it?  Maybe I&#39;m not really OK! Ironically all this pushing of &quot;me time&quot; just tends to make me feel guilty (for not giving myself what I didn&#39;t even need in the first place).  That&#39;s why I am grateful to see this topic - I can say oh, wow, maybe there&#39;s not really anything wrong with me :&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most people feel they need me time because a) some external voice says they do or b) they don&#39;t like being with their kids, which I have alwasy felt is the result of setting up adversarial relationships with them from the get go.  So I try to remember that when they insist that I need &quot;me time&quot; it&#39;s coming from an entirely different perspective - they don&#39;t enjoy their kids, so they can&#39;t imagine NOT wanting to get away from them.  Parents so often set themselves up as &quot;us against them&quot; it&#39;s just sad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother and his family are on vacation in Cape Cod - they rented a beautiful house with a stunning view of the water where they are staying for two weeks.  And all he can say is he can&#39;t really call it a vacation because he is with his 2 1/2 and 7 1/2 year olds.  A self fulfilling prophecy because he so often forces his agenda on his kids.  It just makes me sad.  Not only would I give anything for a two week vacation anywhere, never mind in such a beautiful setting, I would give anything to be sharing that extraordinary time with my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I feel one way and he feels another (I try to point out that there are ways not to have the &quot;us against them&quot; perspective, not sure it gets through but maybe a little) and I suppose it will always be that way (that we are just different in how we relate to our kids).  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I don&#39;t appreciate people pushing &quot;me time&quot; on me, I suppose I should not push &quot;kid time&quot; on them.

I agree that there is this absolutely sad concept that me time must be had, at all costs, on a regular schedule, As if it is utterly important. while definately important for ones peace of mind, yes, i think when/ if parents go along mindlessly requiring this time for themselves and not choosing to see the moments of give and take, the moment they *can* give, than once again kids are put off to be independent when it&#39;s not necesary.<br/>\n<br/>\nlimits vs. possibilities.  it&#39;s like rocket science sometimes:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Laura <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hmbpie&quot; &lt;heatherpie@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today on Facebook a conversation was started about how kids have to go to bed at a certain time so parents can have me time.

So many people talk themselves into needing &#39;me-time&#39;, like being with their kids is such a burden. They rejoice on facebook when they get some kid-free time. They tell their children that they &#39;have needs too&#39; and that kids must respect mum&#39;s needs. These mums come off sounding needy to me. I much prefer the mingling of different configurations of togetherness, depending on who is around and who is doing what.
