I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do attempt to limit what my son sees.  At least when we are at home-- <br/>\n&gt; when he visits his cousin 2 nights a week he has full access to all the<br/>\n&gt; processed food and cartoon network he wants.  To my delight, he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I limit which channels on TV because of all the advertising-- I REALLY<br/>\n&gt; HATE advertising.  To me, it is a billion dollar industry whose sole<br/>\n&gt; goal is to brainwash us into handing over our money.  I knew this and<br/>\n&gt; thought about this ALOT when I worked in the industry at 22-- and 8<br/>\n&gt; years later I am still astounded at how effectively ads manipulate me.<br/>\n&gt; Even as I am watching and talking to myself about the manipulation,<br/>\n&gt; they are working on me.  It&#39;s scary to me.  I know it sounds fanatical,<br/>\n&gt; but it really is scary to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And today I came across this link: &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html\">http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html</a> &gt;.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; essentially an example of exactly how they touch up the pictures in the<br/>\n&gt; magazines.  I was surprised.  I knew they were touched up-- but I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t realize that even her hands were touched up, that her belly<br/>\n&gt; button was touched up.  There are other pictures in this guys site and<br/>\n&gt; even the shoe ads are fake.  Shoes!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I should mention that I do not and have never come anywhere close<br/>\n&gt; to fitting our society&#39;s image of beauty.  So maybe that makes me extra<br/>\n&gt; sensitive.  But the idea that my child would come to believe that<br/>\n&gt; somewhere there are women who really look like that-- I know they are<br/>\n&gt; fake but deep in my heart there is still a part of me that thinks I<br/>\n&gt; should look like that when I wake up in the morning.  I can&#39;t tell you<br/>\n&gt; how much it bothers me to know in my head that it&#39;s not reality, and<br/>\n&gt; yet still find myself yearning to have what&#39;s in those ads-- a house<br/>\n&gt; without dust, a spouse without pores (!) or lumpy sweaters, shoes that<br/>\n&gt; have no wrinkles . . . stupid stuff.  I know it&#39;s stupid stuff, and<br/>\n&gt; that knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the Barbie sheets sort of goes along with that-- although he has<br/>\n&gt; blue&#39;s clues sheets on the bed right now, lol.  I see the vast array of<br/>\n&gt; character-based stuff for kids and it bothers me to realize that they<br/>\n&gt; are crappy products.  On a base level, they are made of inferior<br/>\n&gt; materials and will feel crappy to your skin within one washing-- the<br/>\n&gt; company who made them didn&#39;t care about the quality of the sheets.<br/>\n&gt; They only cared about how they could get one more parent to hand over<br/>\n&gt; some cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The deal is, it&#39;s capitalism.  And I&#39;m coming to hate capitalism more<br/>\n&gt; everyday.  And maybe it&#39;s because I get depressed in winter, or maybe<br/>\n&gt; the hormones I&#39;m on trying to get pregnant, or maybe it&#39;s my feelings<br/>\n&gt; over the current political situation . . .&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve heard an argument that they will have to live in it, they might<br/>\n&gt; as well get used to it-- that just reminds me of my mother, saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;he&#39;s going to spend the rest of his life behind a desk, he may as well<br/>\n&gt; start practicing now [by going to school]&quot;.  Still, living in a bubble<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense, either.  I guess right now my plan is to think very<br/>\n&gt; carefully about the edges of the bubble, and make sure to expand it<br/>\n&gt; regularly.  But really, I don&#39;t feel at peace with or without the<br/>\n&gt; bubble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Melanie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral,<br/>\n&gt; begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy.

My boys are 7 and almost 4 and I stopped controlling tv about<br/>\n1.5 years ago. In that time I have seen Jason become very particular<br/>\nabout the shows that he watches. We have tivo and he has his favorites<br/>\nset up to record regularly. If he catches a new show, I will ask if he<br/>\nwants it recorded, often he will say no. He doesn&#39;t just watch tv to<br/>\nwatch tv (or because something is on)..he watches because he wants to<br/>\nand he enjoys it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of ongoing conversations about marketing and good quality<br/>\nvs cheap etc. He gets an allowance and is very picky what he spends his<br/>\nmoney on. It is an ongoing process and I have to say that I like the<br/>\ndirection we are going in now. Yes, I have bought things that *I* would<br/>\nnot have a couple of years ago but the boys enjoy them and it is not<br/>\nbreaking the bank. It is also helping them see what kind of toys break<br/>\neasily and how much they end up playing with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest switches for me since I have loosened up controls is<br/>\nseeing my kids as smart kids capable of making good decisions instead of<br/>\nvictims of marketing.

I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do attempt to limit what my son sees.  At least when we are at home-- <br/>\nwhen he visits his cousin 2 nights a week he has full access to all the <br/>\nprocessed food and cartoon network he wants.  To my delight, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI limit which channels on TV because of all the advertising-- I REALLY <br/>\nHATE advertising.  To me, it is a billion dollar industry whose sole <br/>\ngoal is to brainwash us into handing over our money.  I knew this and <br/>\nthought about this ALOT when I worked in the industry at 22-- and 8 <br/>\nyears later I am still astounded at how effectively ads manipulate me.  <br/>\nEven as I am watching and talking to myself about the manipulation, <br/>\nthey are working on me.  It&#39;s scary to me.  I know it sounds fanatical, <br/>\nbut it really is scary to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd today I came across this link: &lt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html\">http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html</a> &gt;.  It&#39;s <br/>\nessentially an example of exactly how they touch up the pictures in the <br/>\nmagazines.  I was surprised.  I knew they were touched up-- but I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize that even her hands were touched up, that her belly <br/>\nbutton was touched up.  There are other pictures in this guys site and <br/>\neven the shoe ads are fake.  Shoes!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I should mention that I do not and have never come anywhere close <br/>\nto fitting our society&#39;s image of beauty.  So maybe that makes me extra <br/>\nsensitive.  But the idea that my child would come to believe that <br/>\nsomewhere there are women who really look like that-- I know they are <br/>\nfake but deep in my heart there is still a part of me that thinks I <br/>\nshould look like that when I wake up in the morning.  I can&#39;t tell you <br/>\nhow much it bothers me to know in my head that it&#39;s not reality, and <br/>\nyet still find myself yearning to have what&#39;s in those ads-- a house <br/>\nwithout dust, a spouse without pores (!) or lumpy sweaters, shoes that <br/>\nhave no wrinkles . . . stupid stuff.  I know it&#39;s stupid stuff, and <br/>\nthat knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Barbie sheets sort of goes along with that-- although he has <br/>\nblue&#39;s clues sheets on the bed right now, lol.  I see the vast array of <br/>\ncharacter-based stuff for kids and it bothers me to realize that they <br/>\nare crappy products.  On a base level, they are made of inferior <br/>\nmaterials and will feel crappy to your skin within one washing-- the <br/>\ncompany who made them didn&#39;t care about the quality of the sheets.  <br/>\nThey only cared about how they could get one more parent to hand over <br/>\nsome cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal is, it&#39;s capitalism.  And I&#39;m coming to hate capitalism more <br/>\neveryday.  And maybe it&#39;s because I get depressed in winter, or maybe <br/>\nthe hormones I&#39;m on trying to get pregnant, or maybe it&#39;s my feelings <br/>\nover the current political situation . . . but I really hate the <br/>\nsociety I am raising my child in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve heard an argument that they will have to live in it, they might <br/>\nas well get used to it-- that just reminds me of my mother, saying <br/>\n&quot;he&#39;s going to spend the rest of his life behind a desk, he may as well <br/>\nstart practicing now [by going to school]&quot;.  Still, living in a bubble <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense, either.  I guess right now my plan is to think very <br/>\ncarefully about the edges of the bubble, and make sure to expand it <br/>\nregularly.  But really, I don&#39;t feel at peace with or without the <br/>\nbubble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n&quot;The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral,<br/>\nbegetting the very thing it seeks to destroy.
