So a coalition of commercial fishermen and biologists<br/>\nhas begun to investigate with about $200,000 from the North Pacific<br/>\nResearch Board. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t want the fishermen to have an economic loss. Plus it&#39;s a<br/>\nbiological loss, because we don&#39;t know how many sablefish are being<br/>\ntaken,&quot; said whale specialist Jan Straley, a lead investigator in the<br/>\nproject. &quot;My interest is biological, and I really want to understand what<br/>\nthese whales are doing.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo harvest black cod, fishermen sink a 2-mile-long line with baited hooks<br/>\nevery 3 to 6 feet. Each end is anchored to the sea floor along the<br/>\ncontinental slope and buoyed at the surface. After an 8- to 12-hour<br/>\n&quot;soak,&quot; fishermen haul the line, sometimes harvesting hundreds of<br/>\nsablefish in a single set. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few decades, some of the gulf sperm whales apparently<br/>\nrealized that fishermen were bringing this deep food source to the<br/>\nsurface, and learned to remove a 20- to 30-inch fish from hooks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No one likes to get fewer fish, but take one look at those big whales and<br/>\nyou realize you&#39;re out of your league,&quot; said longliner Dan Falvey, who,<br/>\nalong with Curran, is one of 10 fishermen working with Straley. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSperm whales find prey with their extraordinary hearing, able to perceive<br/>\ntheir environment with echoed clicks and other sounds. The whales have yet<br/>\nto get seriously hurt or entangled in the sablefish gear, according to<br/>\nfishery managers and whale biologists. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStraley and her partners have found after one season suggests that male<br/>\nsperm whales may patrol the edge of the continental shelf, where the water<br/>\nis 1,200 to 3,000 feet deep, and wait for fishing boats. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For sure they know the sound of hydraulics engaging. ... It&#39;s like<br/>\nringing the dinner bell for them,&quot; said Linda Behnken, director of the<br/>\nAlaska Longline Fishermen&#39;s Association, which is coordinating the study. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everyone knows whales are smart, and they&#39;re proving it,&quot; she added.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
