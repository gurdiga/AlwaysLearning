I know for us, this has been a most treasured resource and a place where I can come and get much needed perspective and clarity. Often, I will answer my own question before posting it, as I think through the types of responses I may have read here or on your website. It also helps me to read the questions of others, as you often point out, because sometimes that issue comes up later and I will already have some creative ideas in my toolbox.
