He went to Kindergarten for a few months and went from a kid who LOVED having a stack of books read each day to a kid who didn&#39;t let me even read to him for over 2 years.  We waited.  He played video games that required a bit of reading and got tired of waiting for me to walk in from the kitchen to read whatever he needed to be read.  He got to where he recognized a few words and that grew.  He still mainly sight reads and if there are more than a few sentences it overwhelms him.  I don&#39;t think it is a &quot;reading&quot; issue but rather a neurological issue...he is extremely antsy, understands visual-spatial things that are in motion in an uncanny way, has mixed dominance neurologically, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nEach year he has learned more and more.  I don&#39;t know if he will ever read for pleasure but he is able to read for information at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kid was really wanting to read, if they were upset, I would ask if they wanted me to try to help them.  I would do it just like I would help them learn to ride a bike or bake a cake.
