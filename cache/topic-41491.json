I&#39;m a voracious reader from  even further <br/>\nback. If pressed, I don&#39;t think I could pick one I liked more than  the other-I <br/>\nlove them both, in different ways.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor my children, right now, reading isn&#39;t a big deal. Wyl  *loved* being read <br/>\nto when he was ... well, since he was able to sit up on my  lap. We&#39;d read <br/>\nbook after book after book. When he got proficient at reading  himself, he went <br/>\nthrough a couple books on his own, then we meandered through a  couple more <br/>\nbooks with me reading to him and since then, he hasn&#39;t been  interested much in <br/>\nreading *books*. Magazines, video games, video game hints on  t.v., parts of <br/>\nbooks (mostly instructional, or non-fiction), comics, yes. Books,  not right <br/>\nnow. Storm putters around with it occasionally, wanting me to read to  him, <br/>\nwanting to thumb through a book, then he&#39;s done for a while. We have loads  and <br/>\nloads of books of all sorts and age ranges all about the house-in every  room, <br/>\nin fact-even in the hallways! The books are definitely there if they want  to <br/>\ntake them up again. We live a 10 minute walk from the library. Books are easy  <br/>\naccess-just no interest.<br/>\n <br/>\nVideo games, on the other hand, are huge. And such a different  experience <br/>\nwith us (and friends) than books! Books are quiet, one person reading  alone, <br/>\none person reading to others, not much discussion. Not while  reading-afterward, <br/>\nsome discussion, but not *during*. Video games, though, are a  huge social <br/>\nexperience!! Everyone is talking, sharing, watching, laughing,  offering <br/>\nsuggestions-even if only one person is playing! But we have multiplayer  games and <br/>\nmultiple player interactive games for our handhelds and that is even  *more* <br/>\nfun! Tips to share, new critters, new levels, new items to buy, an  awesome <br/>\nreplay-all things to share with those nearby. I couldn&#39;t even begin to  recall how <br/>\nmany times a day one of my guys says, &quot;Hey, Mama, look at THIS!&quot;, and  I&#39;m <br/>\nalways happy to see what neat thing they have to show me-which often turns  into <br/>\na good 10-20 minute dialogue afterward about how that particular thing was  <br/>\naccessed or came about. It often also has it&#39;s own connections to other  <br/>\ndiscussions, more opportunities to learn stuff, look stuff up, move on to  another <br/>\ntid bit.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople talk about how &quot;isolating&quot; video games are and that  just puzzles me. <br/>\nIt is *so* not isolating in any way at our house! We have  systems that are <br/>\nsemi-portable, handheld games for every member of the house,  separate rooms we <br/>\ncould be in-yet, everyone likes to play together or at least  *be* together <br/>\nwhile some play. The only time they really played separately is  when we <br/>\ndiscovered the remote play possibilities on our DS handhelds and then  they liked to <br/>\nhave one upstairs while the other was downstairs for a few games,  then they&#39;d <br/>\nswitch places. That fascination was over in one day, because, of  course, <br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t dialogue over the game! :~)<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think my kids are unique in the way they play video  games, <br/>\nespecially since we have friends that are the same way. It *could* be  different types <br/>\nof personality, but maybe it is perception. I find the more  immersed I get in <br/>\nunschooling, the more whatever perceived conflict I have is  about my <br/>\nperception of it. Or pre-conceived ideas. If I can stop myself and take  a fresh <br/>\nviewpoint, as if I&#39;ve never heard of or experienced said thing that&#39;s in  <br/>\nconflict, and really see it through &quot;new eyes&quot;, I have a much better chance of  <br/>\nremoving the source of conflict and discomfort from my life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/_\">http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/)\">http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/_\">http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/)\">http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n**************From Wall Street to Main Street and everywhere in between, stay <br/>\nup-to-date with the latest news.

But you can make it easier for him to want to join in and play. David will often have a list of jobs that he has to get done floating about in his brain. I can help him to feel free enough to be able to move from that list to hanging out Simon and Linnaea by making sure that I take care of a lot of the household chores that get him buzzing about in a minor frenzy. Keeping the house cleaner, taking care of some of the yardwork, making sure the little things that matter to him are done help him to feel less stressed, less torn between duties he feels must be done and the more enjoyable aspects of life that he sees as leisure time activities, like playing on the Xbox with the kids. Over time he has relaxed his needs for tidiness a lot and changed his perspective on what is leisure and what is important. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more David feels relaxed and happy and like all that needs doing is done, the more time and attention he feels he has to give to Simon and Linnaea and me. The more he sees me and the kids having a good time together the more he wants to join in. Sometimes it helps to change the scenery, to go to the beach or to go skating or to go to the zoo or a museum or out for lunch or dinner. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Rod Thomas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodneykathy@...\">rodneykathy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 28 January, 2009 12:43:58 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] dad connection<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you convey to your husband how important it is to make a connection<br/>\nwith his children, that he is running out of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you do this without badgering, annoying, or making him withdraw.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Watching <br/>\nprograms they both enjoy has been a very important way for Jayn and my dh to <br/>\nconnect with each other, after work and at other times.  It seems like <br/>\nsaying &quot;stare like drones&quot; (as I assume you meant) shows a pretty negative <br/>\njudgment about tv watching and an assumption that it precludes connecting. <br/>\nThat has not been my observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso at our house having toys and games out certainly does not preclude <br/>\nwatching tv. Jayn has been multitasking in front of the tv her whole life. <br/>\nIf kids are distracted from interesting play by the tv, that sounds to me <br/>\nlike maybe they don&#39;t get enough tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me having the tv on quietly in the background while she and I play, draw <br/>\nor craft, has sometimes been a lifesafer in allowing me to keep my energy up <br/>\nenough to continue playing with her, especially if I am tired. We have lots <br/>\nof shows we love and quote back and forth to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn also needs and demands her father&#39;s attention when he gets home from <br/>\nwork. He needs a few minutes to transition and decompress, and is often <br/>\nphysically exhausted. My part in helping Jayn get her need met from her <br/>\nfather pleasantly instead of being angry and aggressive was not to try to <br/>\nmanipulate them both into some activity that I approved of, but to be really <br/>\nstraightforward and tell dh my observation of Jayn&#39;s behavior and what I <br/>\nthought she was telling him. He then talked to Jayn and together they came <br/>\nup with the daily routine that they now follow more or less.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe always speaks to her when he first comes in and asks for time to get <br/>\nsettled, then he calls her in and they wrestle and/or watch tv and/or look <br/>\non the computer. They have games that are totally separate and different <br/>\nfrom the games and interests that she and I share.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently they have started what I can only describe as a research project <br/>\ntogether. They go out on the weekends together and have been observing and <br/>\nphotographing the progress of a major dredging project on the beach near us. <br/>\nLast weekend they even spoke to the engineer or foreman in charge about what <br/>\nthe sand was and other questions. They bought little notebooks to dedicate <br/>\nto the thing. It is very fun for them, and it was an idea that they <br/>\ngenerated together from just being out driving and doing errands one <br/>\nSaturday a few weeks ago, when they noticed the work beginning. But I have <br/>\nno doubt that part of the plan to follow the work was inspired by a shared <br/>\nenjoyment of a bunch of shows about amazing engineering that they have <br/>\nwatched together at different times.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

When I read to my children (they&#39;re 15 and 11), I am on the sofa, we&#39;re snuggled up under a blanket or we&#39;re all lying on the sofa, we&#39;re interacting about the book, using our imagination, we may have some classical music in the background etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, but when the video games are on, the kids are not paying attention to me.  (My children have been reading for a long time, way before we got video games so this is not an issue for us.)  They are into the game, and if I were to read the story to them it would be just so that they could get to the next screen.  Then there&#39;s the beeps and boops, the noises, the distractions of the on-screen goings-on and such.  I just can not see how this is in any way like reading a book to my child, I really can&#39;t.  I am not trying to start anything, but I&#39;ve only been unschooling for a short time and I logged onto several of these lists and I&#39;ve read this at least a dozen times in the last few weeks.

Her writing skills, as in communication<br/>\nthrough text, is very good.  She types very well, faster than me and she<br/>\nspells things correctly and uses punctuation correctly.  I didn&#39;t teach<br/>\nher those things, she learned them through reading things she was<br/>\ninterested in like websites and games.<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter books are ok, if you really like reading.  Reading serves a<br/>\nfunction other than reading for the sake of reading and it might help to<br/>\nsee that.  There are many adults who never read chapter books, but read<br/>\nonline, or magazines, or job applications, or any of the other numerous<br/>\napplications of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that really helped our family, was to get books on cd and tape<br/>\nfrom the library, and listen to stories.  Hearing stories and ideas, and<br/>\nwritten word, went a long way!  Book for book, Chamille had acquired<br/>\nmore than most of her schooled peers, without ever opening one and<br/>\nreading it herself.  So, by the time she was 11/12 and figuring out how<br/>\nto read, she had a lot of understanding of written language that helped<br/>\nher figure it out in a book form.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, we had a neighbor kid over and Margaux, my 7 yr old, and her<br/>\nwere trying to figure out something to do.  Margaux said, &quot;hey, we could<br/>\nread some Nancy Drew books!&quot;.  Her friend said &quot;eeeww, I&#39;m not reading,<br/>\nI&#39;m not at school!&quot;.   So, Margaux doesn&#39;t know how to read fluently<br/>\nyet, and loves the idea of it and would do it for fun and play, and her<br/>\nfriend, who does know how to read, won&#39;t because she finds it to be a<br/>\nchore, homework, something unpleasant that is done to her in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what is the point of reading?  Is it to be able to read chapter<br/>\nbooks one day?  Or are there other better reasons to read?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best reason to do ANYthing, is simply because you want to and have a<br/>\nreason to do so!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304763189,"authorName":"cookiesforthree@verizon.net","from":"&quot;cookiesforthree@...&quot; &lt;cookiesforthree@...&gt;","profile":"cookiesforthree@verizon.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Hello!!

I have a wonderful husband, Sean and <br/>\nthree handsome and extremely fun boys, Cody (18), Mikey (9) & Scotty <br/>\n(7).  We live in San Bernardino County in Southern California.  We <br/>\nlive in the snowy part with all the squirrels and coyotes and <br/>\nfriendly mountain neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been teaching our kids at home for 5 years for some, 9 or 7 <br/>\nfor others.  My oldest, Cody, went to private school, then public <br/>\nschool, then we pulled him out and taught through a charter school <br/>\nwhen he was in 8th grade.  My other two did charter for a while too.  <br/>\nKind of hated it.  So, then we went all crazy.... and then we are now <br/>\nour own private school.  Cody really wanted to play sports, so we <br/>\nenrolled him in a private school that has a homeschool division that <br/>\nwe can teach anyway or whatever we want to.  That works.  He loves <br/>\nfootball, baseball and is having fun playing soccer.  He will <br/>\nofficially graduate in June, however, he could now, he just wants to <br/>\ndelay higher education until he&#39;s done being a kid.  He&#39;ll start <br/>\ncollege in fall of this year.  Still trying to decide what he wants <br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMikey & Scotty are &quot;unschooled&quot;.

They really didn&#39;t <br/>\ncare at all about sentance structure as much as they did about <br/>\nbuilding hotwheel tracks and lego structures.  So, we decided to <br/>\nplay, watch tv, play video games, go to the park, have sleep overs in <br/>\nour tent on the deck, go to Dad&#39;s work and use his date stamper a <br/>\nbillion times, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning to enjoy unschooling, but still am a little fearful <br/>\nthat my little kids will never learn to write properly or read a <br/>\nchapter book all on their own.
