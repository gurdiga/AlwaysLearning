They don&#39;t mind doing that without<br/>\nus being there all the time (we regularly check) . And when they need us,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll come down.

I&#39;m a little bit confused maybe, because I<br/>\nknow some unschoolers will say that parents should do their &#39;thing&#39; and the<br/>\nkids will join, or do their thing. While I think the people on this list say<br/>\nthat unschooling is looking at your child all the time and connect with them<br/>\nall the time. I&#39;m just not sure how I can do *my* things on a day/in a life<br/>\nlike that. I almost feel guilty when I&#39;m loading the washing machine, or<br/>\nplanting my courgettes, for not paying direct attention to the kids at that<br/>\nmoment. Of course, I&#39;m hearing them all the time.

It sounds like your particular 8yo doesn&#39;t need you or desire you there with him all the time, and that he&#39;s fine being in the house while the rest of you are outside doing something else. You should be able to periodically check in with him and keep connected that way, and perhaps he&#39;ll wish to come join you at a stopping point in his game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general advice is that parents need to be with their children just as long as the children need them to be there. Some (very few) 4 year olds are okay alone for relatively long stretches of time. Some (very few) 12 year olds need to have mom in the same room all the time they&#39;re awake. Most kids have needs somewhere within that range. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn my local unschool list the question comes up every year or so &quot;What age did you let your kids stay home alone while you went out?&quot; It&#39;s not a question that can just be answered with a number, so that the questioner can then just sort of average them out. The answer for all of us is pretty much &quot;It depends&quot;. Some families live in neighborhoods where no one else is home in the middle of the day, leaving a child few options if they needed help. Some families live next door to supportive relatives. Some children are likely to sit quietly reading a book while mom runs to the store, some children are never still even when sleeping. Some children are still dangerously impulsive as young teens, some are reliably cautious at 6. For some families, a trip to the mailbox is a 20 minute hike, while others have a convenience store on the corner. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re related ideas. Some 8 year olds need their parents right beside them all the time, some don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Spending time with three kids","postDate":"1271597106","msgId":52940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyNjcwRjI2LTIzNTYtNENCQy1CRTU4LTc1MjZEQjU4M0Y1QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZEMjU4OTEyNjQxMTQ0Rjg4ODJCM0Q5Q0NBRkNCREI3QGtvb3BtYW5zPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxZGZnOStodG9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QjQyMzI3QUUtRTNBQy00MjgxLUFGRTUtQ0FDQkU1QTFENDc1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NkJDQkI3QjMyMUJDNEQyQUEwMkMwMjFCQzRDRUQxNzVAa29vcG1hbnM+IDw1RTI0M0UxODEyMDU0QjVDQjE4QjFDNjNEOUFBOTE5M0BFZFBDPiA8NkQyNTg5MTI2NDExNDRGODg4MkIzRDlDQ0FGQ0JEQjdAa29vcG1hbnM+"},"prevInTopic":52937,"nextInTopic":52959,"prevInTime":52939,"nextInTime":52941,"topicId":52905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It was just that I was wondering how I could spend the *entire* day with three boys at the same time. -=- Where did you get the idea that you had to ?
