I thought I was the only one with a child that sheds his<br/>\nclothes the moment his feet hit our house.  Because of the prudishness of<br/>\nmany Americans that I run into I was worried last summer about getting my<br/>\nfilms developed.  Most of them were of the kids doing things naked in the<br/>\nback garden, such as building sandcastles, painting on the walls, climbing<br/>\non the playset, running through the water and in the house there Zak was<br/>\nnaked building legos, playing on his computer.  Max also kept trying to take<br/>\nof his diaper and would sometimes do that.  Some of my friends think it&#39;s<br/>\nodd that he doesn&#39;t put clothes on.  I don&#39;t.  He puts them on when he goes<br/>\nto play soccer or go to Karate or a playdate.  I don&#39;t have to force him to<br/>\ndo that... But when he&#39;s home he loves to be naked... and I thought this was<br/>\na Virgo thing (LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4508,"nextTopicId":4518}}
